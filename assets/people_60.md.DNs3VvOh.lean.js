He was elected as the first vice president of Peru in 1903, under the ticket of President Manuel Candamo , but he died before taking office. Biography Lino was born to Toribio Alarco and Ignacia Bredi√±ana. He studied at the Noel College and at the Santo Toribio Council Seminary . In 1851, he began studying medicine at Colegio de la Independencia (later the Faculty of Medicine of the University of San Marcos) and graduated as a doctor in 1858 with a thesis on \\"Liver abscesses\\". He then served as assistant professor of Descriptive Anatomy and main professor of General Pathology and outpatient clinic for men, dictating this last subject in the old Hospital of San Andr√©s, and later in the Dos de Mayo Hospital, which was inaugurated in 1875 by the government of Manuel Pardo . In 1870 he went to Europe to develop his knowledge, and travelled to France and Italy . He learned modern techniques of antisepsis and the application of chloroform as an anesthetic during surgeries . Back in Peru in 1872, he was the first individual to carry out major surgical operations, including an ovariotomy , the details of which he published in the journal La Gaceta M√©dica in 1878 . In 1876 he was elected senator from the department of Huancavelica to the Congress of the Republic of Peru . In 1880, he served as state Councilor in the dictatorship of Nicol√°s de Pi√©rola. In 1881, he represented the province of Trujillo in the National Assembly convention in Ayacucho . In 1890, he was elected senator from the department of Amazonas and in 1891, he was elected alternate senator for Huancavelica and was elected in full capacity as senator in 1894. Between 1899 and 1903, he served as vice-rector of the University of San Marcos . For the presidential elections of May 1903, an alliance between the Civilista Party and the Constitutional or \\"Cacerista\\" Party was formed . The civilistas launched Manuel Candamo as a candidate for the presidency, while the constitutionalists, managed to elected Lino Alarco and Serapio Calder√≥n as candidates for the first and second vice presidents, respectively. The alliance won in the elections, since there was no opposition . However, Lino Alarco died months before the transfer of power took place, so he did not take the oath of office. Although the issue of electing a new first vice president was discussed in Congress, it was not implemented. Candamo also died eight months after assuming power, victim of a sudden illness. So Serapio Calder√≥n had to assume power temporarily, in his capacity as the sole vice president. Lino Alarco was one of the founders of the Lima Medicine Society, an institution of whose he served as president in 1877. He is also among the founders of the National Academy of Medicine ( 1889 ). He was also a collaborator of La Gaceta M√©dica, an organ of the Lima Medicine Society.

Matt Mead wrote on Gigslutz: \\"With similarities to Kraftwerk and Air, the album exhibits swathes of atmosphere music pieces which evoke days of traveling at night on a cool summers evening or lazy days whilst the sun goes down.\\" While Mr Olivetti concluded his review on Freq with: \\"There is mystery and intrigue here, as well as sparse beauty and joyous movement that definitely bears repeated listening.\\" And Paul Simpson of Allmusic stated: \\"The overall effect of the album is tense but escapist, like taking a pleasant vacation but still not quite approaching complete relaxation.\\" In Germany the album was record of the week in Spex magazine, and on the Elektro Beats radio program of RBB.

It was the first LGBT+ bookshop in Scotland, and the second in the United Kingdom. The play Love Song to Lavender Menace by James Ley (2017) was inspired by the bookshop.  History  Origins = The Lavender Menace Bookshop began as a bookstall called Lavender Books in the cloakroom of Fire Island gay disco on Princes Street, Edinburgh. The name of the stall was taken from the Lavender Menace radical lesbian feminist collective which was active during the 1970s. On 21st August 1982 founders Bob Orr and Sigrid Nielsen opened the Lavender Menace Bookshop in the basement of 11a Forth Street. In the first 10 days of being open the bookshop took nearly ¬£1300 of sales, despite homosexuality only being legalised in Scotland in 1980. = Other activities = As well as selling books in the shop itself the Lavender Menace also operated a mail order service, which the magazine Gay News remarks was \\"particularly important for the many Scottish gays desperately isolated by geography and vestigial public transport\\". The shop was advertised in various LGBT magazines, such as Gay Scotland and Gay News and Gay Times, as well as producing its own intersectional newsletter which was subtitled \\"non-racist, non-sexist, non-sensical\\". The shop also hosted groups and events, for example an open meeting for the Gay Youth Movement in 1983 and Lesbian Reader's Evenings in 1985 which attracted guests such as authors Jeanette Winterson and Suniti Namjoshi. = Book seizures = Similarly to other LGBT bookshops of the time, such as Gay's the Word in London, the Lavender Menace Bookshop lost much of its stock to book seizures by the UK government's Customs and Excise. In 1984 officers seized 26 books from the Lavender Menace shop, and a shipment of books worth ¬£250 that were destined for an Edinburgh Festival Fringe reading was detained at Prestwick Airport. Further stock from America was impounded at the docks. The shop's founders circumvented this for a time by addressing their deliveries to Miss Marianne Woods and Miss Jane Pirie, two notable lesbians who lived in Edinburgh in the early 19th century, and sending them to private addresses. They were eventually discovered, although Nielsen noted in an interview that \\"I was just happy that their names should be remembered ‚Äì even by customs men at the docks\\". In 1985 the shop instigated an effort to raise ¬£400 towards a campaign by Gay's the Word bookshop in London to defend the shop's owners against charges related to the importing of allegedly \\"indecent\\" books which had been seized at customs. = West and Wilde = In 1987 the shop moved to Dundas Street, and the name was changed to West and Wilde, after the writers Vita Sackville West and Oscar Wilde. Sigrid Nielsen was not involved in this next phase of the bookshop, which was run by Bob Orr and Raymond Rose. In 1994 a campaign by the bookshop raised funds of ¬£10,000 to continue its work as both a bookshop and community centre. However, the bookshop closed permanently in 1997 due to financial difficulties, with Nielsen citing the stocking of LGBT books by mainstream shops and the increasing popularity of buying books over the internet. Nielsen said in an interview, \\"we just couldn‚Äôt afford to discount books, and, of course, Waterstones could. That undermined the idea of people coming to us first. And the internet was just beginning to take off as well.\\"  Legacy  In October 2017 the play Love Song to Lavender Menace by the Edinburgh playwright James Ley premiered at Royal Lyceum Theatre in Edinburgh. The play drew inspiration from the story of how the Lavender Menace Bookshop was founded and is set in the last few days of the shop's time at Forth Street. In 2019 Nielsen and Orr revived the Lavender Menace as a pop-up bookshop, with the aim of setting up an LGBT digital library and archive.

Life  Anoyara Khatun was born in a below-poverty-line family in Choto Asgara village, Sandeshkhali, rural North 24 Parganas district, West Bengal in 1996. She lost her father at an early age, and when she was twelve she was taken to New Delhi where she worked as a domestic help. After a few months as a domestic worker, she escaped and returned to her village and found the condition of children in it terrible. Children were being forced into labour, and some were trafficked to the cities and over the border into Bangladesh, while others were forced into child marriage. With the intention of changing the situation around her, she came in contact with 'Dhagagia Social Welfare Society' and Save the Children, where she learnt the concept of child rights. To reach out to a larger number of people, she initiated the process of forming groups which would be self-reliant in child rights. Within a short period of time Anoyara helped to reunite 180 trafficked children with their families, stopped nearly three dozen child marriages, rescued 85 children from child labour and got 400 children back into school.

It is located in Kamarhati in the North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal, India. The area is under the jurisdiction of Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). History Ariadaha-Dakshineswar situated close to North Kolkata carries a glorious past in the Bengal Renaissance that still remains largely unacknowledged in the mainstream historical accounts. Once it was under the jurisdiction of Calcutta (Kolkata) District. Within 24 Parganas, Kolkata was one of the Parganas and Ariadaha-Dakshineswar was under it. Like other ancient parts of Rarh Banga (adivision of ancient South Bengal) this place was full of the ancient inhabitants of Bengal like the Hanri, Dome, Nishad, Kahar who originated from the Proto-Australoids according to Anthropology. Other casts like the Brahmans, Kayesthas and the Vaidyas etc. entered later. However, with the tide of time a mixed culture grows and inherited by the peoples of this region though there were two groups of people were in the frontline of the cultural scenario. One was liberal and other was certainly conservative. The conservatives constituted the most powerful sections of society with the liberals lagging behind as their opposition could hardly cause flutter in the orthodox socio-cultural matrix. The scenario did not show any significant change even after the introduction of colonial British education and culture in this region as happened in the other parts of old Calcutta. During the last half of 15th century, from almost about 1690 A.D., Kolkata began to reorient itself towards colonial culture under the leadership and colonial tutelage of Job Charnak. But little did change in the region of Ariadaha-Dakshineswar‚Äîthe old society beset with inhuman superstitious practices. Ariadaha-Dakshineswar as a part of old Calcutta as it witnessed a cultural interface between both conservative and liberal forces. From the medieval period, highly educated and economically enriched families began to enter this region (Ariadaha- Dakshineswar), effecting significant changes in the socio-economic patterns. Ariadaha-Dakshineswar was primarily the motherland of highly educated middle class. One of the janapadas (a big unit of 20 or more villages in ancient India) of Calcutta could not become a big city and that was Dakshineswar (Sen: 2004). Famous Historian Martin mentioned Dakshineswar as the Capital of Bengal (Mullick: 1403, Bengali Year). The cultural sphere of Ariadaha-Dakshineswar was patronized and encouraged by the Maharajas the regional rulers of Krishnanagar of Nadia. The educated liberals were in the leading part of the protest movement by the Vaishnavas, Shaivas and Shaktas against the Brahmanism. Thus a new line of thought spread across this area. One of the opinions regarding the origin of the name of Calcutta was the word Kalikhetra and it denotes the place from Kalighat to Dakshineswar (Dey: 1989). Location Ariadaha-Dakshineswar is situated 22040'0 North latitude and 88022'0 East longitude and 11 kilometers away from Chowringhee, under the jurisdiction of Kamarhati Municipality (Malley: 2009) now. Today if we draw a borderline on four sides of it, we can see Kumarhatta (now Kamarhati), another ancient settlement is situated on its north, Alambazar-Baranagar on its south, Belgharia on the east and the Hooghly River on the west.Google maps Memorable placesTemples= * Ariadaha Muktakeshi Kalibari * Adyapeath Temple * Ariadaha Path Bari * Bindhyabasini Temple =River Side= * Sukhada Debi (Battala) Ghat * Char Mandir Ghat * Sarat Ghosal Ghat * Satish Ch.

Founded in 1989, the club is affiliated to DBU Jutland, the regional football association. The team plays its home matches at Arena Vest Kunstgr√¶sbane. The club was founded by Turkish immigrants and has advanced through the league system, currently playing in the fifth highest Danish league, Jutland Series, after having spent some seasons in Denmark Series, the fourth division. History Vatanspor was founded by Mustafa Pelit, current chairman of the club, and a group of other young men with a Turkish background on Lottesvej 12, Brabrand in 1989. The intention of forming the club was keeping troubled youths away from the streets and at the same time uniting young people with an immigrant background in one team. In June 2011, in a Series 1 match against local rivals from Lystrup IF, a supporter from Vatanspor spat the match official in his face after the match, which had seen some questionable refereeing decisions. As a result, the club was suspended by the Danish Football Union (DBU) in both league- and cup matches, a decision which was since overturned after a dialogue between all parties. Vatanspor was, however, required to hire guards on matchdays. As of 2020, Vatanspor has five teams represented in the regional tiers of DBU Jutland, with its first team competing in the Jutland Series. In 2016, the club reached the Denmark Series, the fourth highest tier in Danish football, for the first time in its history after beating SSV H√∏jfyn in play-offs. Thereby, Vatanspor became the only second immigrant club in Danish football history to reach that level after FK Prespa, a Copenhagen-based club with Macedonian roots achieved this feat in 1999. Vatanspor has around 100 members and has been represented by people with Danish, Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi, Sudanese, Somali, American, Faroese, Bosnian, Libanese, Palestinian and Kurdish background.

It is based on the off-Broadway play My Big Gay Italian Wedding by Anthony J. Wilkinson. The film stars Salvatore Esposito and as fianc√©s Paolo and Antonio; Diego Abatantuono and Monica Guerritore as Roberto and Anna, Antonio's parents; and Dino Abbrescia and as Donato and Benedetta, Antonio and Paolo's flatmates. Plot In Berlin, Antonio proposes to his live-in boyfriend, Paolo, who says yes. Paolo asks if he can accompany Antonio back to his Italian village, Civita di Bagnoregio, for Easter, which Paolo suggests is a good time for Antonio to come out to his parents. Antonio and Paolo arrive in Civita with their flatmates Benedetta and Donato, and Antonio nervously announces his news at dinner. Antonio's father, Roberto, is shocked. His mother Anna announces that she is excited to celebrate the wedding, but she has conditions: it must happen in Civita; she will hire famous wedding planner Enzo Miccio; as mayor, Roberto will officiate the ceremony; and Paolo's mother must attend. Paolo explains that he has not spoken to his mother for three years since her negative reaction to the news that he is gay, but Anna is adamant. Roberto refuses to perform the ceremony yet is willing to attend the wedding elsewhere, but Anna exiles him from the house until he changes his mind. Anna brings Antonio and Paolo to Father Francesco, who agrees to help them convince Roberto, and to officiate the wedding if they are unsuccessful. With Antonio, Benendetta and Donato in tow, Paolo reluctantly visits his mother in Naples to invite her to the wedding. She has no interest, and cross-dresser Donato offers to pose as Paolo's mother. Enzo enlists the entire town to create the beautiful wedding Anna is expecting at a local ruined church. Antonio's ex-girlfriend Camilla is still in love with him, and her attempts to insinuate herself into his new life make Paolo temporarily doubt Antonio's devotion. Anna threatens to file for divorce if Roberto does not capitulate. He, in turn, sets the wedding venue on fire, and has to be rescued by Antonio and Paolo. The next day, Roberto officiates the ceremony in the town square. Donato walks Paolo down the aisle dressed as a woman, but Paolo is pleasantly surprised to see that his real mother Vincenza is already there. Camilla interrupts the wedding with the reveal that she and Antonio slept together once after he and Paolo were together. Upset, Paolo moves to leave, but Antonio stops him by professing his love and singing \\"Don't Leave Me This Way\\", joined by the wedding guests. Cast * Diego Abatantuono as Roberto Brambilla, Antonio's father, the mayor of Civita. He is proud of his supposedly progressive views, but proves to be less tolerant of his son's homosexuality. * Monica Guerritore as Anna Di Gastoni, Antonio's mother. She is much more accepting of Antonio's lifestyle, but she has nonnegotiable conditions for his wedding, and delivers multiple ultimatums to Roberto in an effort to make him comply. * Salvatore Esposito as Paolo Baiello, Antonio's fianc√©. He is a \\"burly, bearded guy not totally unlike Antonio's dad\\", and is estranged from his own mother. * as Antonio Brambilla, an Italian actor living in Berlin. After Paolo accepts his proposal, Antonio realizes he needs to tell his parents, who do not know he is gay. * Dino Abbrescia as Donato Lavopa, Antonio and Paolo's \\"chatty new flatmate who is battling personal issues and cannot be left alone\\", thus accompanying the group to Civita even though the others barely know him. * , Benedetta Stanchi, Antonio and Paolo's \\"skittish\\" and \\"no-filters\\" flatmate and landlady.

He is a Franciscan monk and family friend who offers to marry Antonio and Paolo in a deconsecrated church if Roberto fails to change his mind. * Enzo Miccio as himself Production Based on the off-Broadway play My Big Gay Italian Wedding by Anthony J.

Release My Big Gay Italian Wedding was released in Italy on 1 March 2018. The same month, Breaking Glass Pictures acquired the US distribution rights to the film. Critical reception On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval ratings of 67% based on 6 reviews, with an average score of 5.65/10. Matthew Breen of NewNowNext explained, \\"With overtones of The Birdcage and Mamma Mia, the film toys playfully with Italy's lingering homophobia, preventing Italian same-sex couples from getting full marriage (rather than 'skim-milk'-style civil partnership).\\" Jake Wilson of The Age wrote that the film \\"aims to cater to the public while challenging it just a little‚Äînot by overturning accepted notions about family, gender or religion, but by demonstrating that same-sex unions pose no threat to these notions when things are properly understood.\\" Steve Warren of the Windy City Times called the film \\"fun\\", and suggested that it was intended to help make Italians more receptive to the same-sex civil unions made legal in Italy two years before. Broadway World wrote that \\"the aisle to the altar is paved with hilarity, hijinks, and lots of love\\", and Leigh Andrew Hill of OutInPerth stated that \\"this romantic comedy will leave you on a high.\\" Matthew Toomey of The Film Pie called the film \\"a likeable crowd pleaser with plenty of genuine giggles\\", praising the cast and the \\"nice mix of scenes that balance the craziness with the tenderness.\\" He noted, \\"Every character in the film has self-generated problems and instead of going for the obvious solution, they follow romantic comedy clich√©s and make life as difficult as possible.\\" Toomey also criticized the script for rushing through some storylines, which he felt was \\"most evident during the quick-fire climax where some of the character transformations lack credibility.\\" Pietrangelo Buttafuoco of Il Foglio called Abbrescia a scene stealer, and noted that in the film, Italian comedy lends itself to teach viewers a lesson. D. M. Bradley of the Adelaide Review wrote that the film places \\"serious, weightily-themed drama alongside audience- pleasing laughs\\", but noted that it \\"has a nice cast and a tough edge, but throws it all frustratingly away.\\" He added that the \\"grievous sin\\" of an ending \\"casts all plot threads aside\\" in a sequence that \\"demonstrates that Genovesi (and Wilkinson) simply didn't know how to end it.\\" Alex First of The Blurb called the film \\"absurdist\\" and \\"an embarrassment\\", criticizing the characterizations and the lack of chemistry between the leads.

Because he refused to marry a young woman, when he had to, his crew mutinied against him and punished him in this way (read the story All Saints Day). The Russian, with whom he is an accomplice, agrees to take him on board, after making fun of him. Together, they discuss their project to accomplish their mission, in the service of the \\"Monk\\", a mysterious pirate ruling on the Pacific Ocean, whose identity is unknown. Young Maori man performing in a kapahaka group. Apparently (based on Flickr tags) taken during a Maori dance troupe event in Rotorua. Their mission is to loot coal ships of various nationalities on behalf of the German Empire, as the World War I approaches. Thus, they attack a Dutch cargo ship near Malaita and board a member of his crew, a young Maori sailor called Tarao. Political map of the island of New Guinea from 1884 to 1919 (the Kaiser-Wilhelmsland is to the northeast). During the following times, all this world sail together in Melanesians islands. At first, they go to Kaiserine (German possession in New Guinea). There, the pirates must discreetly meet their customer, Amiral Von Speeke. While Rasputin deals with the Germans, Corto keeps the catamaran on the Ottilien-Fluss (Ramu River), with the cousins who are prisoners and the crew. Then, they are victim of a storm and sink near the Sepik River. Ramu River from air. Corto and Pandora, who survived, hide in a cave. A dispute began between them: in rage, she shoots him, making him unconscious. Then, they are taken prisoner, with Tarao and Cain, by cannibals Seniks (Papuans). Then, the Fijian Cranio success to liber everyone and they board in a boat. Finally, they are saved near the New Britain (Bismarck Archipelago) by the German soldier Christian Sl√ºtter, in his submarine. Inside, they meet Rasputin and a Japanese sailor, nicknamed Taki Jap. Together, they set a course for the hidden island of Escondida, the Monk's lair. The latter could be very old, trafficking for over one or two century. In the same time, several people have become attached to them, in particular towards Pandora, such as Corto or Sl√ºtter. On the spot, the Monk announces to his henchmen a news dating from August 4, 1914: England declares war on Germany. Therefore, they themselves are also at war. So he prepares plans for the future. Also, he hears about Pandora and Cain and seems curiously interested in them. In fact, he wants to protect them and questions them a lot about their family. Likewise, he orders Rasputin to be responsible for their safety, over his life. Recently, Pandora was the victim of an accident and become unconscious. Thus, the Monk meets her and, seeing her asleep, strangely enters a crisis of dementia. He feels sad and alone: the Maltese tries to support him. Then, he decides to advance his departure, leaving with Sl√ºtter and Corto, whom he considers his only friend. But by a new act of madness, he pushes him from the top of a cliff, before leaving without him, believing him dead. At the same time, Cranio is responsible for the management of the island during his absence and must closely monitor Rasputin. The Fijian talks to Pandora and reveals that Corto survived his fall and is hiding in a shelter. Likewise, he reveals to herwhat he knows about the Monk. This mysterious figure is a former Protestant pastor, replacing another monk who once ruled this island. The latter trafficked in slaves (which earned him his excommunication), until he became ill with leprosy. When he died, he was replaced by the current monk. And the natives relatively accept to be led by him. Indeed, they are freer than other natives of Oceania, who are colonized. Traditional outrigger boat of L'√éle-des-Pins, New Caledonia Latter, a conflict breaks out between Rasputin and Cranio: the former kills the latter. Cain cares about Corto. Meanwhile, Pandora embarks in an outrigger boat with Tarao, who uses his seafaring skills to seek help. Guided by the shark Mao, they arrives in Bura Nea island (Admiralty Islands), where they meets New Zealanders soldiers. Gradually, the conflicts of the First World War began. The Australians and the Japaneses discover the plans of the Germans. Rinald Groovesnore, Royal Australian Navy Officer and cousins' uncle, was notified and arrived on Bura Nea. Thanks to Tarao and Pandora, he discovers Escondida. The Monk, informed by Corto of the departure of the two young people, supposes that his lair will be found. He then deserts the island by a submarine with Taki Jap. But, just before, for mysteriously reasons, he tries vainly to kill Sl√ºtter. When Rinald Groovesnore arrives, everyone is arrested except the two fugitives, who were able to leave in time. Pandora and Cain testify positively in favor of Corto, who is thus pardoned. But Sl√ºtter is condemned by Rinald Groovesnore to be executed and attempts from the cousins to save him are useless. Rummaging through Sl√ºtter's belongings, Cain and Tarao discover a letter he addresses to Corto. He reveals a capital secret that could have saved him. He explains the identity and the secrets of the Monk, whom he learned during a delirium from this mysterious man. He is actually Thomas Groovesnore, Rinald's brother and Cain's uncle. In the past, he passionately loved a woman named Margretha, who was his lover. But she eventually married his brother Tadee. During the ceremony, desperate, the man torched the house where the lovers had spent time and made believe in his death. Only she was expecting a baby from him; she claimed it came from her husband. This baby ... it was Pandora. This is why the Monk was protective of the cousins and went mad when he saw Pandora. Seeing in his daughter the face of the woman who was the ambition of his life, he was tortured by his painful past. And that's why he wanted to kill Sl√ºtter, so that he wouldn't reveal his secrets. Affected by the execution of his friend Sl√ºtter, Corto tries to blackmail Rinald Groovesnore with the letter to avenge him. To create trouble for the Officer, he forced him to release Rasputin, also sentenced to death. The latter will be grateful to the Maltese, admitting to having a deep friendship, despite the hatred he seems to carry. January 1915: the time for farewell comes. Corto greets Cain and Pandora, leaving aboard a destroyer. They are now his friends, just like Tarao. The latter embarks with the Maltese, who goes away in his ketch, in the company of Rasputin. Together, they will cross the Pacific for new tribulations ... About this episodeCharacters= This episode features many characters, some of whom will reappear or be mentioned in later episodes: *Cranio: Fijian sailor, who worked when he was young with a lawyer in Viti Levu (largest island in the Republic of Fiji). This Rasputin's crew master has the Monk's confidence. He regrets to see his people involved in the wars of the Whites people and aspires that the Melanesians finally unite. This would establish a Melanesian homeland, a similar claim among Polynesians. *Rasputin: Russian pirate crisscrossing the Pacific on behalf of the Monk. He is greedy, ruthless, violent and fond of murder. He does not hesitate to assassinate people who get in his way. He often promises Corto to kill him one day. But deep down, he feels affection and shows loyalty to him, whom he considers his only friend. Thereafter, he will reappear in many other episodes of the series, being the Maltese's best friend / enemy. *Pandora and Cain Groovesnore: Main characters of this story, they come from the family dynasty ruling the South Seas, the Groovesnore, based on Sidney. Rinald Groovesnore, the vice admiral who commands the Royal Australian Navy fleet, is their uncle. Cain is British and Pandora is American. Their personality and their relationships with the other characters will evolve throughout the story. Hating Corto at first, he will become his friend, while she will have sentiments for him. Thereafter, Cain will return in the story Burlesque Between Zuydcoote and Bray-Dunes (in the volume Celtic Tales). While Pandora will only be mentioned and will only reappears in Corto's dreams (for example in The Golden House of Samarkand). Pandora Groovesnore owes its name to an Pratt's acquaintance, the Australian Pandora Grosvenor, a ship-owner's daughter. *Corto Maltese: Born in Malta, this sailor has travel around the world. Due to various circumstances, he became a pirate, then began to work for the Monk with his friend Rasputin. Romantic, elegant and ironic, he is quick off the mark. Throughout history, he has had feelings for Pandora. Then, he will remain haunted over the years by this ancient love. *Tarao: He is a New Zealand Maori who was spared by Rasputin during the attack on the cargo ship, to enter his service. Young experienced sailor, he knows how to take advantage of the beliefs and legends of the peoples of the South Pacific. In his village, he was educated by a certain Miss Star, who runs his school with his father, the chief. Then he worked on a Dutch cargo ship to learn a job, where he was captured. Thereafter, he will keep company with Cain, Pandora and Corto. *Christian Sl√ºtter: Lieutenant of the Kaiserliche Marine, the Imperial German Navy, he reluctantly received orders from his superiors to take command of a submarine to place himself at the disposal of the Monk. *The Monk: A pirate leader, he constantly wears a cowl and hides his face and his identity under a hood. From his island, Escondida, he heads a secret organization that rules the South Seas. He put himself at the service of Germany to procure coal for its boats crossing the region. No one knows its identity and some claim that it has existed for over two hundred years. *Toko, aka \\"Taki Jap\\": Japanese military, captain of a gunboat. =The first Corto Maltese's appearance= This story by Hugo Pratt introduces a new comic book character destined to become famous: Corto Maltese. Yet, he is not the main character in this story, who are Cain and Pandora Groovesnore. The latter is the central character, according to Pratt. He explains that everyone is in love with her, that she is a kind and beautiful girl who becomes an adult. Corto is just a secondary character, like so many others in this story. The cartoonist does not suspect that he will reuse it for a whole series. To pretend that this story is true, Pratt published in addition a fake letter from Cain's nephew, Obregan Carrenza, which he had to give to the cartoonist himself. This process is also often used in adventure novels. This document, dating from the middle of the 20th century √©vokes Corto's old age and his sadness following the death of his friend Tarao. This letter is missing from many editions of this story, probably because some publishers refuse to let the reader imagine the aging hero. =Sequel and prequel= Hugo Pratt will reuse Corto Maltese for news adventures taking place in America, published for the first time in 1970 and collected in the volume Under the Sign of Capricorn. This is the start of his Corto Maltese series, comprising in all twelve episodes. One of which takes place eight years before the first episode, in 1905 in Manchuria (China), relating the meeting between Corto and Rasputin: Corto Maltese: The Early Years. After Pratt's death, the series was resumed by Ruben Pellejero and Juan Diaz Canales. They have currently made three additional episodes. In the last one, they imagined a prequel to The Ballad of the Salty Sea, All Saints Day, to explain why Corto was attached to the raft and how he worked for the Monk. AnalysisThe island of Escondida= Abaiang. Escondida is a fictional island located in the Western Oceania, the scene of an important part of this story. Its coordinates are 169 ¬∞ west longitude, 19 ¬∞ south latitude. Which corresponds to the location of the Tanna Island (in Vanuatu, near New Caledonia). However, Pratt claimed that his model was Abaiang (Gilbert Islands, Kiribati). =Literary references= This story abounds in literary references. For example, at the start, Rasputin is reading \\"Voyage autour du monde\\", Louis Antoine de Bougainville's travel diary. This French explorer indeed sailed in the same zone where he is at that time. Cain, on several occasions, spreads his culture by various allusions. Thus, when he failed on a beach with Tarao, he compares themself to Robinson Crusoe and Friday (characters created by Daniel Defoe). Then, when they escape from the cannibals with the others, he tells him about Moby Dick (from the novel Moby-Dick, by Herman Melville). Latter, in Sl√ºtter's submarine, he is reading The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, long poem by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Finally, when he leaves Escondida with Pandora, he evokes the ship Argo and the character Jason, from Greek mythology. =Inspirations= Twenty years after the creation of this story, Pratt slipped a dedication into it. It pays homage to the Irish writer Henry De Vere Stacpoole. It was he, the first, who made Pratt like the South Seas. And not Robert Louis Stevenson, Joseph Conrad or Herman Melville. This author wrote in 1908 the romance novel The Blue Lagoon, a good story that pleased to Pratt. That why he dedicaces him this story. =Oceanian cultural elements= Hugo Pratt discreetly slides into his story various allusions to cultural elements of the different Oceanian peoples encountered, whether through their songs or their conversations. They allude for example to gods, creatures or illustrious people, like Kanaloa, TƒÅne, T≈´, Rongo, Tangaroa, MƒÅui, Kupe, , Pehee Nuee Nuee the great fish ... They also speak of mythical places like Hawaiki. Finally, they evoke several of the many Pacific islands: Mangareva, Hawaii, Tahiti, Heragi (MƒÅori name for Pitcairn Island, in Pitcairn Islands), Aotearoa (MƒÅori name for New Zealand), Tubuai ... The decor of the comic is punctuated by various Oceanian masks. Several of them are thus visible on the house where Cain is a prisoner. These items resemble those made by Baining people, they live in Papua New Guinea. Despite this realism, Pratt allows himself touches of fantasy, sometimes making his Oceanian characters speak ... in Venetian language (element that the translators leave as is). Awards and tributesAwards= The album won the award for the best foreign realistic work at the 1976 Angoul√™me Festival. =Ranking= This story was classified in 2012 at the 3rd place of the classification of \\"50 essential BD\\" established by the Frenc magazine LIRE =Preface= Umberto Eco, Italian novelist and literary critic, made a preface to this story (present for example in a 1989 edition) on the geographic and cultural references of this story.

Aurelius Investment, LLC, 590 U.S. ___ (2020), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding the status of the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico under the Appointments Clause. The Court held that all officers of the United States are subject to the Appointments Clause even if their duties relate to Puerto Rico. However, the power they exercise must be primarily federal in nature for the Clause to apply. If the officer exercises powers primarily of a local nature, even if created by federal law, then the officer is not \\"of the United States\\" and is exempt from compliance with the Clause. As members of the Board are primarily concerned with the governance of Puerto Rico, even though their decisions have potentially nationwide consequences, their powers are primarily local in nature and need not be appointed in compliance with the Clause. Case background In the years prior to 2014, Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, had several economic issues, including a period of depression, that caused it to accrue a large amount of debt with creditors. U.S. law prevents the territory from declaring bankruptcy under Chapter 9 on its debt, an option normally afforded to other U.S. states and divisions. In February 2014, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's downgraded Puerto Rico's debt rating, causing some of their prior creditors' agreements to now require repayment in months rather than years. By this point, it was estimated that Puerto Rico had acquired more than in debt across some 165,000 creditors, and failure to pay off these agreements would have added additional billions to what the territory owed. The territory attempted to clear some of the debt by passing the Puerto Rico Public Corporation Debt Enforcement and Recovery Act, allowing public corporations like utilities to file for bankruptcy but this was ultimately ruled unallowed under the existing law via the Supreme Court case Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust as being too similar to Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The inability of Puerto Rico to clear its debt led to the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA) in June 2016. PROMESA created a Fiscal Control Board (FCB), composed of seven members along with the Governor of Puerto Rico as its eighth, non-voting member. The FCB saw to help Puerto Rico restructure its debt to be able to pay off its creditors in a timely manner, develop a fiscal plan to support that payment schedule while meeting the necessary welfare and services of its residents, and otherwise help direct the fiscal responsibility of the territory. The Act also shielded Puerto Rico from any lawsuits from its creditors by imposing a moratorum period following the bill's passage to allow the FCB to establish a plan, and then afterwards, to have such cases heard in a special court, the District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, with cases to be overseen by Judge Laura Taylor Swain of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, who had been appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts. Of the seven members of the board, six were selected by the President of the United States from a list of recommendations from Congress based on previous ties to Puerto Rico businesses, and the seventh of the President's choosing. PROMESA did not require any affirmation of these appointments by the Senate. As the FBC was formed and work began to establish a fiscal plan and debt restructuring, the initial deadline for which Puerto Rico could default on payments had passed and in May 2017, several creditors filed suit against the territory for failure to pay. The FCB issued its intent to have these cases heard in the special court established by PROMESA. The cases held at this court looked to significantly cut back how much Puerto Rico owed to its creditors. This was also impacted by Hurricane Maria that struct Puerto Rico in September 2017, causing an estimated in further costs for recovery, which impacted how much the territory could pay back to creditors under PROMESA. Unable to challenge the special venue, the creditors turned to challenge the validity of the core of PROMESA, arguing that the board of the FCB, as Presidential appointees, need to be affirmed through Senate approval as part of the Appropriations Clause, and thus were unconstitutional. Judge Swain rejected the creditors' arguments on the constitutionality of PROMESA, which created multiple appeals to the First Circuit Court of Appeals. In a combined ruling in February 2019, the First Circuit reversed the special court's findings and agreed with the creditors that the appointment of members to the FCB, while not to a federal position but established by a federal law, required Senate confirmation, and thus their appointments were unconstitutional. The First Circuit did not declare any past deals that the FCB to be nullified, asserting that even without appointment, the actions and deals of the members of the FCB remained valid under the de facto officer doctrine, and gave the U.S. administration 90 days to make the Senate to make the necessary confirmations before the effect of the Circuit decision took place to nullify the FCB's authority. Supreme Court The FCB itself made an emergency petition to the Supreme Court to hear the case, as well as to extend the deadline due to delays in the reappointment process within the Senate; President Donald Trump had provided a new list of names by June but the Senate was several weeks out before they could begin confirmation hearings. The Supreme Court accepted the petition on June 20, 2019, scheduling to expedite the case in October. With the Supreme Court's acceptance of the case, the First Circuit agreed to extend the deadline for reappointments until the Supreme Court delivered its opinion on the case. Oral arguments were held on October 15, 2019. Questions arose around the applicability of the Insular Cases, the First Circuit's opinion to leave the past FCB decisions in place under the de facto officer doctrine, and what impacts on Puerto Rico would occur based on multiple decision outcomes. The Supreme Court issued its decision on June 1, 2020, unanimously reversing the First Circuit's decision and upholding the appointment of the FCB board without Senate confirmation. Justice Stephen G. Breyer wrote the majority opinion that was joined by all but two Justices. Breyer wrote that the FCB \\"is part of the local Puerto Rico government\\" with a range of duties and powers \\"backed by Puerto Rican, not federal, law\\", and thus negating the need for the board members to be confirmed via the Appointments Clause.

The phrase originates from the last words of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who was killed in 2014 after being put in a chokehold by New York City Police. A number of other African- Americans, such as Javier Ambler, Manuel Ellis, Elijah McClain, and George Floyd, have said the same phrase prior to dying during similar law-enforcement encounters.; According to a 2020 report by the New York Times, the phrase has been used by over 70 people who died in police custody. The phrase is now used in worldwide protest against police brutality in the United States and against the lack of police accountability due to qualified immunity.  Origin of the phrase  The phrase originated in July 2014 during the death of Eric Garner who was put into a chokehold by Daniel Pantaleo, a New York City Police Department officer. A video of Garner restrained by multiple officers which showed him saying \\"I can't breathe\\" 11 times before losing consciousness and dying was widely circulated. When it was announced on December 3 that after considering the case for two months the grand jury had decided not to indict Officer Pantaleo, protests erupted with Garner's last words, \\"I can't breathe\\" used as a slogan and as a chant. Following the December 2014 acquittal of the officer who put Garner into a chokehold, the slogan experienced a dramatic increase in popularity amid widespread protests. Fred Shapiro editor of The Yale Book of Quotations relates that he had already finished his 2014 list of most notable quotes and sent it out to the media on Dec. 3, the same day that the grand jury decided to not indict Pantaleo for the death of Garner. Shapiro states that as he watched the news coverage with protesters turning Garner's final words into a rallying cry, within an hour he revised his list, making \\"I can't breathe\\" the top quote of the year. He expressed that it was not a slogan of only that moment, but \\"a phrase with real and lasting impact\\" Shapiro said that it was the first time he had ever revised a list.  Expressions of solidarity  Aided by expressions of solidarity from amateur and professional athletes and others, the hashtag \\"#ICantBreathe\\" was tweeted over 1.3 million times during the month of December. Berlin, Massachusetts, December 2014 =Athletes= The first display from athletes was when the Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team wore T-shirts emblazoned with \\"I can't breathe\\" during a December 13 game warm-up. Athletes from both the National Football League and National Basketball Association, notably LeBron James, wore clothing printed with \\"I can't breathe.\\" Following criticism of James, President Barack Obama came to his defense, stating \\"I think LeBron did the right thing...We forget the role that Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell played in raising consciousness.\\" In late December, officials from the Fort Bragg Unified School District in Mendocino, California banned athletes from wearing \\"I can't breathe\\" T-shirts before a three-day high school basketball tournament, before reversing the ban.https://legacy.pressdemocrat.com/news/3310127-181/fort-bragg-school- officials-reverse The American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter in support of the students. =Academics= Linguist Ben Zimmer compared it to similar slogans such as \\"Hands up, don't shoot,\\" which originated in the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, and the older \\"No justice, no peace.\\" Zimmer called it \\"a peculiarly powerful rallying cry,\\" and noted, \\"to intone the words 'I can't breathe,' surrounded by thousands of others doing the same, is an act of intense empathy and solidarity. The empathy comes from momentarily stepping into the persona of Eric Garner at that instant the life was being choked out of him.\\" Zimmer noted that, in the variant \\"We can't breathe,\\" the phrase becomes directed towards social change and more metaphorical. Phrases seen on protests signs such as \\"Justice can't breathe\\" and \\"Our democracy can't breathe\\" extend the meaning beyond the physical circumstances of Garner's death. Joshua D. Rothman of the University of Alabama noted that fashion statements such as the \\"I can't breathe\\" T-shirts are \\"easily and often dismissed by opponents as a cheap gesture or a stunt.\\" However, analyzing the fashion craze in the late 18th and early 19th century for the \\"Am I Not a Man and a Brother?\\" cameos made by Josiah Wedgwood for bracelets and hair ornaments, and subsequent incorporation of the kneeling slave image into many different types of products as the most widely used symbol of the American abolitionist movement, Rothman asserted that \\"we ought not underestimate fashion's value and significance for building momentum and visibility for a political cause.\\" =Others= The cast of the movie Selma wore \\"I can't breathe\\" shirts to their December premiere. Actor David Oyelowo recounts that members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences complained to movie producers and stated that in retaliation they would not vote for Selma to receive Oscars. Oyelowo states, \\"It's part of why that film didn't get everything that people think it should've got and it birthed #OscarsSoWhite.\\" Professor Grace Ji-Sun Kim and Reverend Jesse Jackson wrote in a December 2014 opinion piece that the phrase \\"has become a slogan for the people who have taken to social media and the streets to protest the killing of unarmed African Americans, challenging a system that fails to indict and calling for greater equality.\\" The phrase has been frequently invoked in protest songs and other music. Eric Garner's siblings released the song \\"I Can't Breathe\\" in 2016. The first English song by Russian band Pussy Riot was entitled \\"I Can't Breathe\\". Songwriter H.E.R. released a song by the same name in 2020.. Kole Black also released a controversial anthem entitled i.Cant.Breathe on July 21st 2020. = Counter-reaction = Supporters of the New York City Police Department marched on December 19, 2014 in black hoodies emblazoned with \\"I can breathe, thanks to the NYPD\\" and shouted \\"Don't resist arrest!\\" at counter-protesters. Separately, shirts produced and sold online by Jason Barthel, a police officer in Mishawaka, Indiana, that stated, \\"Breathe Easy: Don't break the law\\" drew criticism. Barthel stated, \\"When you break the law, unfortunately there's going to be consequences, and some of them aren't going to be pretty.\\" Members of the city council of South Bend, Indiana asked then- mayor and future-U.S. presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg for cooperation in banning the city from future contracts with Barthel's uniform business. Buttigieg's political opponent Henry Davis Jr. described the response: \\"He refused to touch it. And when he touched it, he agreed with both sides.\\" =Misappropriated usage= Anti-mask protesters and conspiracy theorists have misappropriated the phrase to signal their opposition to mask requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Christopher Lowe  Christopher Lowe died while handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser in Fort Worth, Texas on July 26, 2018. When Lowe told officers he was dying and could not breathe, officers told him \\"Don't pull that shit,\\" berated him, threatened to pepper spray him, and conspired not to tell medical staff about his medical condition, according to disciplinary letters issued against the officers. Five of the officers were fired while two were suspended without pay. Six officers have appealed; one waived his right to appeal and accepted the suspension in lieu of termination.  Javier Ambler II  In March 2019, Javier Ambler II died while being arrested in Austin, Texas. Ambler was arrested and tased after fleeing from deputies who sought to stop him for a traffic violation and leading them on a 22-minute car chase which ended in crash. His final words were \\"I can't breathe.\\" Ambler's death was ruled a homicide, caused by congestive heart failure and hypertensive cardiovascular disease in combination with forcible restraint.  Derrick Scott  Derrick Scott died in Oklahoma City in May 2019 after being restrained by officers for about 13 minutes. Police were responding to a call about someone brandishing a gun. Scott fled when confronted by police and a gun was removed by an officer during the arrest. One officer put her knee between Scott's shoulder blades and a second straddled Scott's back. When Scott told officers multiple times that he couldn't breathe, one officer responded, \\"I don't care,\\" and another said, \\"You can breathe just fine.\\" Scott died at the hospital an hour later due to a collapsed lung, according to an autopsy that found physical restraint, recent methamphetamine use, asthma, bullous emphysema and atherosclerotic heart disease contributed to Scott's death. Following an investigation that cleared the officers of wrongdoing, Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater told the press, \\"I mean, he's just a perfect candidate to die when you‚Äôve got meth in your system and those kinds of physical ailments and then you fight with police. [The officers] didn‚Äôt do anything wrong at all.\\" Byron Williams Byron Williams died in police custody in Las Vegas on September 5, 2019, saying, \\"I can't breathe.\\" Williams had been flagged down by Las Vegas Metro Police officers after they spotted him riding his bike without a safety light just before sunrise at 5:48 a.m. He fled officers and abandoned his bike and then scaled two walls before being arrested 1 minute and 40 seconds after the start of the encounter. According to police, he resisted by refusing to give up on his arms and that he had drugs on him which he tried to conceal. He was arrested and according to the police video, Williams was held down while on his stomach, he said \\"I can't breathe\\" at least 17 times before he eventually lost consciousness. At the end of the pursuit, five officers had arrived at the scene to assist in the arrest. Paramedics arrived 14 minutes after Williams lost consciousness and he was later declared dead at the hospital. Las Vegas police controlled the narrative by releasing only some of the bodycam video to the public. None of the officers involved has been charged. The incident is one of several police custody deaths that re-emerged following the death of George Floyd. John Neville John Elliott Neville died in Winston-Salem, North Carolina December 2, 2019 after being restrained in the Forsyth County jail. During a medical emergency, he was behaving erratically. He said, \\"I can't breathe\\" at least ten times, as well as \\"Help me\\", \\"Let me go\\" and \\"Mama\\". While he was in prone restraint, a technique discouraged in 1995 by the National Law Enforcement Technology Center, jail staff had difficulty removing his handcuffs. Neville had no pulse and CPR was used, but after being hospitalized he died December 4. Five jailers and a nurse were charged. As of July 24, protests had continued for two weeks. Video of the incident was released after news outlets demanded it. Manuel Ellis Manuel Ellis died on March 3, 2020 during an arrest by police officers in Tacoma, Washington. Ellis pleaded \\"I can't breathe\\" with officers before dying in the minutes after his arrest. A witness contradicted earlier police accounts of his arrest and death. Video showed police punching Ellis during the arrest. The Pierce County medical examiner ruled that Ellis's death was a homicide, resulting from hypoxia due to physical restraint. The medical examiner said other factors contributed to Ellis's death, including methamphetamine intoxication, heart disease and a mask officers had placed over his mouth meant to stop spitting or biting.  George Floyd  A protester holds a sign saying \\"I Can't Breathe Momma,\\" at a Black Lives Matter Rally in Dumfries, Virginia. \\"I Can't Breathe Mama,\\" was one of the last words said by George Floyd before he was killed. Minneapolis, May 28, 2020 On May 25, 2020, Minneapolis Police Department officer Derek Chauvin was accused of killing George Floyd by kneeling on the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes. Police body camera video showed that Floyd said that he couldn't breathe before he was on the ground and under Chauvin's knee.https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/ct-nw-nyt-george-floyd- transcripts-20200708-vdqxef3sezferng3nmuzi4blme-story.html George Floyd told Minneapolis police officers he couldn‚Äôt breathe more than 20 times, new transcripts show]Police body camera footage shows full arrest, struggle leading to George Floyd's death Spectator video of the incident showed Floyd saying \\"I can't breathe\\" multiple times while he was under Chauvin's knee. Despite his pleas, as well as a bystander exclaiming that the officer was preventing Floyd from breathing, Chauvin continued the restraint for 2 minutes and 53 seconds after Floyd became unresponsive, while three other officers watched. All four officers were subsequently dismissed from the police force, with Chauvin being charged with second-degree murder, and the three others with aiding and abetting murder. \\"I can't breathe\\" became rallying cry for the subsequent nationwide protests. Protestors have adopted it as a chant. In his first public speech on George Floyd's death and protests on June 2, presidential candidate Joe Biden began with, \\"I can't breathe. I can't breathe. George Floyd's last words. But they didn't die with him. They're still being heard. They're echoing across this nation.\\" That same day, ViacomCBS-owned networks paused their programming to show a black screen for 8 minutes and 46 seconds with the words \\"I can't breathe\\" displayed (For the case of Nickelodeon Networks, it was interrupted by an orange screen with a scrolling message about the Declaration of Kids' Rights). At the location of his death, artists painted a mural memorializing Floyd, but deliberately used the words, \\"I can breathe now,\\" to promote community healing and reclaim a sense of power. = Counter-reaction = On June 24, Scottsdale, Arizona City Councilman Guy Phillips said, \\"I can't breathe,\\" as he took off his mask at a rally protesting the mandatory mask wearing announced by Scottsdale Mayor Jim Lane during the COVID-19 pandemic in Arizona. He was condemned by local and state officials. Arizona Senator Martha McSally stated, \\"Despicable. This is a serious moment in history and it's disgusting you are mocking the dying words of a murdered man.\\" Governor Doug Ducey said, \\"Just flat out wrong. Despicable doesn't go far enough. The final words of George Floyd should never be invoked like this. Anyone who mocks the murder of a fellow human has no place in public office. Period.\\" Phillips later issued an apology.

It is 6.5% the mean equatorial diameter of Ganymede, . It is located in Marius Regio at . At the center of Epigeus, there is a 25-km-radius region of sub-radial dark- floored troughs or fractures. These troughs range from approximately 150 to 250 m across, are generally linear, and merge in dendritic or anastomosing patterns. The troughs exhibit two orthogonal preferred orientations, trending north-south and east-west. A bright, rough-textured, lobate deposit occupies the central 15 to 20 km of this region and locally surrounds troughs up to 25 km from the palimpsest center. This bright region consists of massifs 200 to 300 m across separated by 200 to 300 m. The outer ring is a complex zone corresponding to a crater diameter. The zone between those two rings is relatively smooth and it is covered in small knobs. Several lobes of this unit appear to have flowed into valleys within this outer ring zone. The smooth units in the center and between the inner and outer rings may be a solidified impact-melt sheet. Epigeus' basin is rich with ice deposits.

It was adopted in 1992 following a Court of Appeal ruling that the previous seal which had been used since 1902 was unconstitutional due to its Christian symbolism. The seal is based around the dome on the city's bandstand and uses the American national motto \\"In God We Trust\\" to replace \\"God reigns\\" in the old seal, which was the reason why the United States courts of appeals ruled it unlawful for use.  Original seal  Scottish Christian evangelist John Alexander Dowie, founder of the Christian Catholic Church in Zion, founded the city in 1902. The mayor and council created and adopted the seal in the same year. The seal used a quartered shield with a cross, a dove holding an olive branch, a crown with a scepter with the city name in the shield and the phrase \\"God reigns\\" in a banner above the Christian symbols. The seal appeared in the city's council chambers and on city vehicles. Patches on the city's police and fire departments also included the seal. The flag of Zion incorporated the seal on a white background in a portion of the flag. =Lawsuit= In 1986, atheist Rob Sherman drove by Zion and saw the seal on the city's water tower. The seal's Christian elements offended Sherman and he demanded the city change the seal. The City of Zion refused this demand despite Sherman's threats of legal action. As Sherman lacked standing to bring a lawsuit against Zion, he unsuccessfully appealed on national radio for a Zion resident to support him. He then met Clint Harris at an American Atheists meeting in 1987, and paid for Harris to rent a room in Zion to enable him as the plaintiff in the lawsuit that he filed against the city. In 1990, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois heard the case. The court found that the seal violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's principle of separation of church and state and failed the Lemon test due to its Christian symbols. The court ruled it illegal for Zion to continue its use. The finding of unconstitutionality was due to Dowie's statement that the three symbols were Christian references at the time of the seal's creation. The court also found that the \\"God reigns\\" banner was also a religious statement that had no secular context. The city appealed the District Court decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. A local nonprofit citizen's group called \\"Save Our Seal\\" raised $30,000 to help the city with its legal costs. The appeal was initially decided by a panel of three federal judges in a 2‚Äì1 judgement to uphold the District Court's decision that the seal's symbols served no secular purpose and was thus illegal for the city to use. The city then petitioned the full court for a rehearing. All 11 Appeal Court judges reheard the case and voted 6‚Äì5 against Zion's petition. Zion subsequently appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States. However, the Supreme Court Justices refused to grant certiorari to hear the case, as only three out of the required four Justices endorsed the hearing of the case. Thus the seal remained unlawful for the city to use. The city then had sixty days to comply with court orders to remove the old seal from public view.  New seal  Following Zion's unsuccessful attempt to bring the case to the Supreme Court, the City Council started a competition for a new seal. The contest was won by a 10th grade Winthrop Harbor schoolgirl, who was awarded a plaque and a Christmas ornament of the old seal. The winning seal design was based around the dome of the demolished Zion Hotel which had become the bandstand in the city and the flag of the United States with the American national motto \\"In God We Trust\\" added to it in place of \\"God reigns\\". Sherman again sued with the additional hope of getting \\"In God We Trust\\" removed from American coinage, but this time was unsuccessful due to a federal judge ruling that the motto was constitutional as was the new seal of Zion. Starting in 1993, the city began removing the old seal from public view as the court judgement required. The Zion police department initially covered up the old seal with a white sticker on their patrol vehicles. They then temporarily painted gold stars and the name of Zion over the sticker, as some felt the blank sticker ruined the look of the police cars. By 1994, the police had incorporated the new city seal into their decals. In 2011, the Lake County News-Sun newspaper published a community forum notice by a city commissioner who used the old seal. Sherman sued the city for contempt of court and demanded the commissioner resign. They eventually settled the case out of court.

Built in 1833, the temple is dedicated to a specific Guanyin statue known as \\"Waterflow Guanyin\\" ().No established translation of the Guanyin's name exists. \\"Waterflow\\" is a literal translation of Ê∞¥ÊµÅ.  History  According to legend, in the summer of 1830, a Guanyin statue carried by a flood got stuck in a bamboo forest at the site of the current temple. After the water settled, a group of children found the statue and began worshiping it in the forest. Afterwards, a woman was having a difficult childbirth when a passing midwife came to help. As a token of appreciation, the woman promised to visit the midwife's home in the future. However, the midwife's directions led her to the bamboo forest. Through poe divination, the Guanyin revealed that she was the midwife. Therefore, a temple was built to house the statue in 1833, and the Waterflow Guanyin became a deity for safe pregnancies. A 20 m tall fiberglass statue of Guanyin was erected in 1988. During Typhoon Haitang in 2005, the statue fell over and was destroyed, which was interpreted as the Guanyin sacrificing itself for the people. The statue has since been restored.  Filial piety tree  In the temple's courtyard, there is a sea fig tree that is thought to be more than 160 years old. The 15 m tree has two main trunks, giving it the nickname \\"filial piety tree\\" (Â≠ùÂ≠êÊ®π). The tree is listed as one of Taichung's protected trees.

It was released in Spain in 1907, making it the first Spanish melodrama on film.Review, synopsis and link to watch the film: Plot In Godella, a municipality in the Province of Valencia, a blind man and a young girl ask for charity in a street. First they ask a group of sinister-looking men who rebuff them, then they ask a well-dressed couple who give them money while the men watch with interest. Later, on a deserted road, the group of men attack the couple who had arrived in a carriage. They abduct the woman and force the man to sign a check. The bandits bring the woman to a cave, but the young girl, hidden behind a bush had seen them. Together with the blind man, they free the woman. As the young girl exits the cave, she sees the man together with a group of policemen. She shows them where the woman was held and they decide to ambush the bandits. The police easily overpower the bandits and the couple thank the blind man and the young girl for their help. Production and analysis right The film was produced by Film Cuesta, the first film studio in Spain, created in Valencia in 1904. Sandie Holgu√≠n, Creating Spaniards: Culture and National Identity in Republican Spain, The University of Wisconsin Press, 2002, p. 222. The Director √Ångel Garc√≠a Cardona had already directed 20 short documentaries between 1899 and 1904. The film was shot on location in Godella, in the province of Valencia, in 1906 and is regarded as the oldest Spanish melodrama which has been preserved. Before this date, Spanish films were mostly short documentaries or short comedies. The film is composed of 6 scenes with a total of 11 shots using 7 different sets, 6 outdoors and one indoors. According to Tatjana Pavlovic, the film is illustrative of most of the traits that marked early silent Spanish films and more particularly of the thriving production activities of Films Cuesta in Valencia. \\"El ciego de la Aldea, with its central blind character, originates from the long Spanish literary tradition of found in orally transmitted ballads and Cordel literature.\\"Tatjana Pavlovic & al., 100 Years of Spanish Cinema, Wiley- Blackwell, 2009, p. 5. Antonia Rey Reguillo has stressed that the cinematography of this film marked a departure from \\"primitive cinema\\" where the frontal camera gave a theatrical perspective. Here, on the contrary, the camera is positioned on the side which makes it possible to have images with great depth and perspective. She also stresses that the way in which actors avoid overacting demonstrates the search for naturalism. This is reinforced by extradiegetic details such as the dog who crosses the screen in the fourth shot. This was likely unplanned and resulted from the fact that the film was shot on location but it adds an element of realism. The indoor scenes, which use theatrical elements such as the painted backdrops, are those which are closest to the esthetics of theatre plays. This is even accentuated by the fact that in the last shot, where the bandits are overpowered, the actors briefly freeze in a way reminiscent of Tableaux vivants. However, even in these scene, continuity editing with characters moving out of the cave to be seen on an outdoor location in the following shot, make it impossible to identify the diegetic space with the theatrical set.Antonia Rey Reguillo, Cineastas primitivos espa√±oles, la huella de la escena, Universidad de Valencia, 2006.

Egan is an expert and author in the area of PLLs. The first and second editions of his book Frequency Synthesis by Phase Lock as well as his book Phase-Lock Basics are references among electrical engineers specializing in areas involving PLLs. Egan's conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL Baseband model of a type II APLL and its closed-form dynamic model In 1981, describing the high-order PLL, William Egan conjectured that type II APLL has theoretically infinite the hold-in and pull-in ranges.,,, This conjecture can be found in various later publications, see e.g. and for type II CP-PLL. In general, the hold-in and pull-in ranges of type II APLL for a given parameters may be either (theoretically) infinite or empty, thus, since the pull-in range is a subrange of the hold-in range, the question is whether the infinite hold-in range implies infinite pull-in range. For the second- order type II APLL the conjecture is valid,. From a mathematical point of view, that means that the loss of global stability in type II APLL is caused by the birth of self-excited oscillations and not hidden oscillations (i.e., the boundary of global stability and the pull-in range in the space of parameters is trivial). A similar statement for the second-order APLL with lead-lag filter is known as Kapranov's conjecture on the pull-in range of type I APLL. In general, his conjecture is not valid and the global stability and the pull-in range for the type I APLL with lead-lag filters may be limited by the birth of hidden oscillations (hidden boundary of the global stability and the pull-in range) . For control systems, a similar conjecture was formulated by R. Kalman in 1957 (see Kalman's conjecture).

It began as a weekly paper called The Travis County Citizen based in Pflugerville from 1964-65 and then moved to Austin, becoming known variously as The Citizen, The Citizen-Guide, and Citizen News before it became known as the Citizen in 1971, eventually moving to three-times-weekly publication. Upon changing to daily publication schedule on April 1, 1976, Texas Monthly noted: \\"No paper has attempted to go daily in a major Texas city in more than 50 years\\". The Dallas Morning News considered buying the Citizen in 1979. After trying to stay afloat by raising its price to 25 cents and printing in a smaller tabloid format, it folded in October 1981. At that time, the Citizen was an afternoon publication issued five days a week with a circulation of about 14,500 and 80 employees; it was led by Thomas Reay as general manager and executive editor with John F. Warren as publisher. During its weekly days, the Citizen featured a front-page column by Wray Weddell, called an \\"industry- boosting editor\\" by the progressive Texas Observer. Michael Eakin of the counterculture Austin Sun newspaper opined in 1974 that Weddell had \\"completely polarized\\" the issue of economic growth in Austin, saying: \\"He has people thinking in terms of growth or no growth ... There are alternatives and we want people to be aware of them.\\" Further reflecting on the two newspapers publishing in the city at that time, Eakin noted that \\"you do not have a paper which deals with primarily local issues read by a really broad based group of people.\\" However, according to a 1978 Texas Monthly article, the Citizen boasted strong municipal government coverage, with a local public affairs consultant saying the paper \\"blows the Statesman away on city reporting\\", including besting the larger, establishment daily on sewage dumping into the Colorado River, city staffing problems, and misuse of public funds. Other Citizen staff included arts and entertainment writer John Bustin, lifestyles writer Carolyn Bengston, photographer Robert Godwin, and editorial cartoonist Roger \\"Rabbi\\" Moore. The Citizen readership base was in West Austin, and said to be \\"well educated, well-to-do, and civic-minded.\\" A commentary in the Austin Chronicle noted it was editorally \\"a voice for the conservative and business community\\", once featuring a column by Ronald Reagan.

On formation, the union had 197,000 members, rising to 240,913 by the end of 1928, making it the largest union in the industry. It was led by Franz Scheffel, and published several journals, the most important of which was Der Deutsche Eisenbahner. The union was affiliated to the General German Trade Union Confederation (ADGB), and to the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF). In March 1933, the union's journal was banned by the Nazi government. The leadership of the ADGB decided to distance itself from social democracy in an attempt to appease the Nazis, and Scheffel resigned as leader of the EdED in protest. He was replaced by Matthew Herrmann, but in May, the unions were banned. The EdED attempted to continue on an underground basis, led former board member Hans Jahn, and some organisation was maintained throughout World War II, in resistance to the Nazis.

Lechitsky, with 2 companies, carried out a reconnaissance on July 27 for the city of Boyans, occupied by boxers. From August 4 to 6, in the Sakharov detachment, Lechitsky participated in the battle near the city of Azhihe. Then commanding a separate detachment of 2 companies and 1 hundred security guards of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Lechitsky survived on October 3 a successful battle with boxers near the village of Fonigou, near the city of Kuanchenzi. When, at the beginning of 1901, an expedition was organized from the troops of the southern Manchurian detachment to eastern Mongolia, to the city of Kulo, Lechitsky commanded a convoy aimed at providing an important railway station Node in Kabanzi. Produced for fights. difference in colonels, Lechitsky was appointed temporarily commander of the 1st Siberian Rifle Regiment E.V. and military commander of Mukden. On September 2, 1902, Lechitsky was appointed commander of the 7th Caucasian Rifle Battalion, but, without accepting it, on November 3 received the 24th East Siberian Rifle Regiment. =Russo-Japanese war= With a regiment in September 1904, he marched from Liaoyang to Fynhuangcheng and on to Yala. On April 11, Lechitsky was entrusted with protecting a section of the Yalu River from the village of Syndyagou to s. Kuluza, over 18 miles, with a detachment from the battalion of the 24th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, a company of the 10th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, the 1st East Siberian Mountain Battery and 2 hundred.

Ambihe and took his assigned unit detachment, mainly against the mouth of the river. Ambihe is an important crossing point. Apr 18 Tyurenchensky battle broke out. Absolutely not oriented from the headquarters of the Eastern detachment, Lechitsky only received information about him from the Chinese on the 19th and therefore left on the 20th, and on the 21st joined the right column of the Eastern detachment, retreating to Modulinsky Pass.

With rearguard battles, Lechitsky on August 15 retreated to the forefront of Liaoyang positions and located in the vicinity of the village of Mindyafan, and on August 16 he occupied a site at Tsofantunsky position, which he defended stubbornly in the days of the Liaoyang battle. During the Chechen attack, Lechitsky became a member of the left column of the III Siberian Corps and from September 25 to 30 participated in the actions of this corps at Bensihu. At the very beginning of the Mukden operation, as soon as the Japanese attack was discovered against the Tsinchechen detachment, the commander-in-chief sent Major General Danilov (23rd and 24th regiments) from the 2nd Army to support the brigade, which occupied the night of February 15, 1905 position on the Tsandansky heights, near the village of Kudyaz. In these positions, until February 23, Lechitsky, together with other parts of General Danilov's detachment, courageously repulsed all the enemy's attacks, until an order was issued to withdraw the 1st Army across the Yellow River. On May 12, 1905, Lechitsky was promoted to major general for military distinctions, and on August 5 he was appointed commander of the 1st brigade of the 6th V.-Sib. infantry division. On August 15, he was enrolled in His Majesty's Suite; On March 10, 1906, Lechitsky was appointed commander of the 6th East Siberian Rifle Division, and on July 21 - commander of the 1st Guards Infantry Division. It is noteworthy that Platon Alekseevich did not have a higher military education, because did not graduate from the Nikolaev Academy of the General Staff. And the son of a humble priest did not have and could not have any ties in high circles. But this did not in the least prevent him, the nugget of military art, from making a brilliant career in the Russian Imperial Army. On December 12, 1906 he was bestowed upon him the tunic of the 24th East Siberian Rifle Regiment, and on August 26, 1908 he was appointed commander of the XVIII Army Corps. On October 5, 1908 he was promoted to lieutenant general (with seniority of February 14, 1909) and on December 23, 1910 he was appointed commander of the forces of the Amur Military District. Since 1913 - General of Infantry (with seniority of February 14, 1915). =World War I= True glory found the general with the outbreak of the First World War. At the beginning of the war, Lechitsky commanded a group of troops aimed at helping the 4th Army after its failure at Krasnik. On August 9, 1914, he stood at the head of the 9th Army (chief of staff - Lieutenant General A. A. Gulevich), and went through the whole battle campaign with her. Along with the Brusilov 8th Army, it turned out to be the most combat-ready formation of all the Russian armed forces. The very first actions of Lechitsky as commander made him known as a decisive, energetic and proactive commander. During the general offensive of the Southwestern Front, the Ninth Army overturned the opposing enemy, taking September 2, 1914, taking the Polish city of Sandomierz and creating a bridgehead on the San River to attack Krakow. For the Battle of Galicia, General Lechitsky was the first in the Great War to receive one of the highest awards of the Russian Army - the St. George's weapon with diamonds. In total, during the period 1914-1916. only eight people were awarded this award. The counterattack of the Austro-Germans, which followed that same September, forced the 9th Army to retreat and defend itself on the Vistula line in the vicinity of the Ivangorod fortress. In the battles in front of Ivangorod, Russian troops waited for the defeat of the Germans near Warsaw and on October 13 went on the offensive. On November 2, Lechitsky's army captured the lower reaches of the San, again creating the conditions for an attack on Krakow. For the hardest battles near Ivangorod and the defeat of the Austrian 1st Army, Platon Alekseevich was awarded the 3rd degree Order of St. George the Emperor who visited the headquarters of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief Emperor \\"for speeding up the army entrusted to him, crossing the Vistula River from Suliev to New Alexandria inclusively, which was broken \\"stubborn resistance of the enemy and at the same time captured over 200 officers, 15,000 lower ranks, 24 guns and 36 machine guns.\\" The next stage of the 9th Army's combat route is the Carpathian operation (January ‚Äî April 1915). Given the shortage of shells, Lechitsky's main task was to organize defense and provide troops with rear supplies. To overcome the positional impasse, his army was entrusted with a complex and responsible operation to circumvent the Austrian defense and attack in Bukovina. During this operation, it was necessary to occupy Budapest, and then make a turn to the north and move to Krakow, knocking the enemy down successively from south to north. Fighting in the mountains is significantly different from action in the open field. Therefore, Platon Alekseevich issued an order that said: \\"A frontal attack in the mountains leads to huge losses and still does not give a decisive result, why in all cases rounds should be used and, moreover, sufficient forces.\\" Thanks to this tactic, in the battles of March 16-18 near Khotyn, the 2nd and 3rd cavalry corps defeated the Austro-German army group Marshal, which allowed the 9th army to occupy part of the southern Carpathian passes. A successful attack was prevented by the German Gorlitsky breakthrough, which forced the Russian Army to retreat. The victorious march of the German army of Mackensen for some time was suspended by the cavalry of the 9th army, commanded by the legendary Count F.A. Keller. The cavalry broke through the defenses of the Austrians and went to the Prut River, taking the cities of Snyatyn, Kolomyia, Chernivtsi. Nevertheless, the general rollback of the front continued. Against his background, the 9th Army showed great restraint. Having given the Austrians only the Chernivtsi region, she managed to keep her front. Moreover, transferring reinforcements to neighbors, Lechitsky's army tried to hold down the enemy with constant counterattacks in order to prevent him from transferring his troops to other sectors of the front. During the attack of May 19-24, 1915 on the Prut River, the 30th Army Corps of A.M. Zayonchkovsky took 1,5 thousand prisoners. This glorious cause could be successfully developed, but the commander in chief of the armies of the front N.I. Ivanov, contrary to the arguments of Lechitsky, ordered to retreat to the Dniester. During its 4-month retreat, the 9th Army nevertheless took about 70 thousand prisoners, the award for which became the Order of the White Eagle with swords for Lechitsky. In mid-October, the location of the 9th Army was visited by Emperor Nicholas II, who traveled around the front army, who showed his commander 9. In early March 1916 Lechitsky fell ill with lobar pneumonia. He was treated by Julius Osipovich Manasevich, the future personal doctor of General Brusilov. Emperor Nicholas II during the next detour of the front visited the sick Lechitsky at the army headquarters in Kamenetz-Podolsk on March 30, 1916. The name of P. A. Lechitsky thundered throughout the country in the days of Lutsk (\\"Brusilovsky\\") breakthrough (May-September 1916). Today, this operation is traditionally associated only with the name of General Brusilov. Sometimes the name of General Kaledin is recalled. Practically nobody remembers the name of Lechitsky, another co-creator of one of the glorious deeds of the Great War. The 9th Army dealt an auxiliary strike in that operation, which was supposed to distract the enemy from the main direction. Platon Alekseevich was preparing his troops for a breakthrough with all care. He invented a special position - the ‚Äúfield commandant‚Äù. He was obliged to constantly monitor battle areas so that not a single extra soul, be it scouts, observing officers, warrant officers and other persons, would be in the enemy's line of sight. Russian balloons and airplanes regularly flew around their positions, carefully recording the slightest changes that could cause the Austrians to think about preparing an attack. In an atmosphere of strict secrecy, they managed to rebuild new bridgeheads at a distance of 100-150 meters from enemy defense lines. In many areas, the Austrians stretched the barbed wire to 70 rows, and in some places started a current on it, but a powerful and accurate artillery strike, coordinated with the infantry commanders to the smallest detail, helped break through the enemy's defenses. In 19 days, the 9th Army advanced 50 km ‚Äî more than the neighboring armies. In the battle of Dobronouck she defeated the 7th Austro-Hungarian army. About 38 thousand soldiers, more than 750 officers and 1 general were captured by the Russians, 60 guns and 170 machine guns were captured. The Austrians lost 70 thousand in battle. In addition, Lechitsky forced the German troops to leave, who were in a hurry to support the allies. On June 18, 1916, the 9th Army took the strongly fortified city of Chernivtsi, the unofficial capital of Bukovina. This was done contrary to the order of Brusilov, who demanded to turn to Galich and Stanislavov as quickly as possible. Lechitsky, however, understood that it was dangerous to leave an unfinished group and base in a large city on the left flank. Only after ending it, he moved his troops to Stanislavov and on August 11 took him. The award to the legendary commander for his active participation in the Brusilovsky breakthrough was the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky with swords. In the same 1916, Emperor Nicholas II, on the proposal of the Protopresbyter of the military and naval clergy George Shchavelsky, awarded the priest Alexy Lechitsky (father of the general) the Order of St. Vladimir of the 4th degree ‚Äúin retribution of the merits of his son‚Äù, and Archbishop Konstantin (Bulychev) of Mogilev and Mstislavsky with blessing The Holy Synod elevated him to the rank of archpriest. In the fall of 1916, the center of gravity of the Southwestern Front moved south due to the fact that Romania entered the war on the side of Russia. True, the allies immediately proved to be a heavy burden for the Russian army - they were practically unworkable and immediately began to suffer heavy defeats from the Austro-Hungarian. In this situation, P. A. Lechitsky held a front stretched for 320 kilometers for two months, reflecting the violent attacks of two enemy armies. The heroism of his troops delayed the fall of Bucharest for a month! In the end, on November 24, 1916, a new front was created on this site - the Romanian, which included the 9th Army. Lechitsky did not become the commander- in-chief of this front for the sole reason - he did not speak the French language in which he was to communicate with the Romanian allies.Alfred Knox, With the Russian army, 1914-1921, Hutchinson, London, 1921, vol.1, . =Fate after the revolution= After the February Revolution, without reconciling with the new order, he left the command of the army. He was promoted to the post of Assistant Commander-in-Chief of the Romanian Front instead of the resigned General Sakharov. Since April 18, 1917 at the disposal of the Minister of War. On May 7, 1917, retired. He resigned from the post of commander in chief of the armies of the Western Front. December 3, 1919 was arrested for speculating in food, but the next day was released. Since 1920 in the Red Army. Since January 1921, the inspector of infantry and cavalry of the Petrograd Military District.

According to other sources, he was arrested a second time on March 8, 1920, as the head of a counter-revolutionary military organization. Sentenced to 2 years in prison. He died on February 2, 1921 in the 1st Moscow prison hospital. Opinions and ratings Marshal A.M. Vasilevsky in memoirs: The 9th Army was commanded by General P. A. Lechitsky, the only army commander at that time who did not leave the officers of the General Staff, that is, did not receive a higher military education. But then it was a military general: in the Russo-Japanese war he commanded a regiment and was known in the army as an energetic military leader ... General Lechitsky was often in the army, and more than once I had to see him in different front-line situations. Unspoken, but rather agile, to me, a young officer, he seemed, however, somewhat decrepit. \\\\- MILITARY LITERATURE. Memoirs. Vasilevsky A.M. Life's work From the memoirs of the former Minister of War of the Provisional Government and subsequently of the Soviet military leader A.I. Verkhovsky: ... A small, dry old man, all white, with a large white mustache, with a stubborn gaze of narrow, incredulously looking eyes, this general was distinguished by great honesty, military instinct, and caution. Moreover, in his own way he loved soldiers, studied and knew their positive and negative traits. All his activities were subject to the rule: measure seven times and only then cut off. And I must say that in the conditions in which the troops were located, with the clearly expressed reluctance of soldiers to fight, this was the only possible line. Lechitsky advanced during the Russo-Japanese War precisely with these qualities. He watched with great attention both the mood of the fighters and that they were full, dressed and shod. ‚ÄúA soldier without soles is not a soldier,‚Äù Lechitsky liked to say, and he never required efforts from his units that were beyond their capabilities. There were few good commanders during the Russo-Japanese war. Lechitsky was noticed and appointed first as regiment commander, then division commander. If there was no war, he, having commanded a battalion, should have, like most army infantrymen, resigned. Regiments in the tsarist army were given to the guardsmen and officers of the General Staff, and only as an exception to ordinary army officers. But the war helped to reveal his non-shouting, but genuine military talent. What harmed him was a stern look from browed brows. It was not easy for them to discern in this little man a big, honest and full of love for people heart. \\\\- [MILITARY LITERATURE. Memoirs. Verkhovsky A.I. On the hard pass] Publication in the newspaper \\"New time\\" from March 25 (12), 1917: The old honored warrior soldier General Lechitsky was appointed commander in chief instead of Evert. Lechitsky knows the whole Russian army. He earned himself a fighting name back in the Japanese company, and during the days of this war he was the main participant in our attack on Galicia and the Carpathians, recaptured the Austrians from Lublin, invaded the enemy's borders, crossed Bukovina, and recently sat in the Forest Carpathians. Fate has more than once pushed me against General Lechitsky, I had to talk to him, observe him in a combat situation and was always struck by the unusual simplicity, directness and firmness of this man. The son of a village priest, who achieved everything without any patronage solely by his talents, General Lechitsky never turned a blind eye to our military shortcomings, but firmly believed in a Russian soldier and in the fate of Russia. In the days when they talk about the democratization of the army, about the public rights of soldiers, when undeserved accusations are thrown to officers who are no different from soldiers in the war, it would be hard to find a better commander in chief. Strong will, determination, the ability to grasp the circumstances and conform to the situation, the understanding of the soldier - these are the qualities that distinguish the new commander in chief. Commander-in-Chief Lechitsky is not so much a general as a soldier-soldier. AIK \\\\- [AND. IK. The new commander in chief gene. Lechitsky.

As a female, Sarolta Vay was one of the first Hungarian women to complete university studies. Vay worked as a male journalist both before and after the sensational trial for his marriage to another woman in 1889. The case drew the attention of noted sexologists of the period, including Havelock Ellis and Richard von Krafft-Ebing, who used it to explore female inversion in the emerging field of sexology. During his lifetime, he was well respected as an author of historical articles on notable figures and cultural topics related to Hungary. Many of his works have been posthumously republished and are considered an important part of his country's literary heritage. Early life Sarolta Vay was born on 6 December 1859 in , in the Pest Central District, Hungary, to Sarolta (n√©e Beniczky) and Count L√°szl√≥ Vay. Stemming from the old and noble who were Counts of Vojvodina and Laskod, her father served as Colonel-General of Archduke Joseph and was the keeper of the crown jewels. Her parents were married in 1855 and because of a law that their estates would pass to the crown without an heir, the couple were quite anxious for a male child. Newspapers in the United States widely reported that when Vay was born, her mother did not disclose her sex to the father and colluded with the priest who baptized the child to perform the service with the male name S√°ndor, but enter the christening in the register with the female name Sarolta. Other accounts, like that of Richard von Krafft-Ebing and Anna Borgos a fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, indicate that why Vay was raised as a boy is unknown. In the manner typical for the gentry at that time, Vay was taught fencing, fishing, horseback riding and shooting. When he was born five years later, her brother was raised as a girl. S√°ndor was taught privately by a friend of his father, , who was a military captain and journalist. At age eleven, when preparing to send his \\"son\\" to the Pest Noble's Academy, Vay's father learned that S√°ndor was actually his daughter. Now known as Sarolta, she was sent to Dresden to her maternal grandmother, Adolfn√© B√≥nis Johanna Beniczky, who enrolled her in a girl's school, which required her to wear girl's clothing. After running away with an English girl for whom she had an infatuation, Vay was returned to her parents. She completed her university courses studying in Leipzig, Berlin and Budapest, becoming one of the first Hungarian women to graduate with a university education. Though she had aristocratic roots, Vay needed to find employment as her family finances were strained by her father's inability to earn an adequate living from his farm. Career Vay from the Wiener Tagblatt, ca. 1900, by Eigner At the age of 16, Vay began publishing poems under the name of Sarolta Vay in the Vas√°rnapi Ujs√°g (Sunday News). Under the mentorship of newspaper editor, Adolf √Ågai, she was persuaded to focus on prose and began submitting articles under a variety of male pseudonyms, including Celesztin, D'Artagnan, Floridor, and Vayk. In the era, women journalists were confined to publishing in lifestyle magazines or women's journals. Working as a male not only increased employment opportunities, but as a freelance journalist, Vay had greater freedom and mobility. From 1880, living entirely as a man, engaging in typical behavior for his class, such as drinking, duels and travel, Vay regularly contributed to such newspapers as Debreczeni H√≠rlap (Debreczen News), az Egyet√©rt√©s (The Consent), Magyar Szalon (Hungarian Salon), Orsz√°gos H√≠rlap (National News), Pesti H√≠rlap (Pest New'), and az Uj Id≈ëk (the New Times), under his male name, S√°ndor. He was connected to both and her cousin , with whom he corresponded about their writing. Recognizing the nostalgic interest of readers for Hungary's past, Vay began publishing historical articles about well-known people, places, and myths. Personal complications Vay was well known in Austria-Hungary and had a reputation as a carouser, frequenting houses of prostitution and night clubs. Around 1882, he was involved in a duel over the actress, , though it is unknown if she returned his affection for her. From 1883 to 1887, he was in another relationship with an actress, Emma Esz√©ki, whom he had met in Ny√≠regyh√°za. The couple were married by a priest and lived together in Pest. Vay ended his relationship with Esz√©ki when he met Mari Engelhardt, a 26-year-old schoolteacher from Klagenfurt. To free himself from the marriage, Vay paid a large settlement to Esz√©ki. Against her family's wishes, the new couple eloped and married in August 1889. Struggling financially, possibly due to gambling debts, Vay borrowed Ft800 from his father-in-law, which he claimed was needed as a bond to obtain employment in a stock company. His behavior resulted in his father-in-law coming to believe Vay was a swindler, suing him for fraud, and having him arrested. Vay in typical attire While he was detained, it was discovered that Vay had forged documents and that he was biologically a woman. During the trial, many people, including the Vay family lawyer, various members of both his and his wife's family, several editors and writers, and the Budapest city commander testified about Vay passing as a man. A midwife was called to make a physical examination of Vay's anatomy to determine if he was intersexed. His wife, who testified that they had consummated their marriage, also stated at trial that she had no idea that Vay was not a man, though the city commander questioned how that was possible, considering that they lived for several months in one small room. To resolve how Vay might have deceived other women while engaged in sex, he was evaluated by C. Birnbacher, who was the Klagenfurt District Court physician, and another physician named Josch. Vay candidly, though reluctantly, explained to the physicians his attractions to other women and described their encounters. Based upon the physicians' statements to the court, that Vay was an invert and unable to behave differently, the court acquitted Vay of fraud and released him without requiring him to revert to his true sex. The father-in-law appealed the verdict, which was then reviewed by Theodor Meynert, a member of the medical faculty at the University of Vienna. Meynert concluded that Birnbacher and Josch had been duped by Vay, who was clearly anatomically a woman. Birnbacher answered that prior to arrest, Vay had led a typical life and did not desire to change his behavior. He had no history of violence, nor had his family or acquaintances felt he needed to be institutionalized. Birnbacher found that the masculine traits Vay exhibited were clearly a part of his identity. He concluded that given a family history of mental instability, Vay was predisposed to mental illness. Coupled with his innate inversion, Birnbacher attested that Vay could not be held responsible for his behavior. Later life When the trial was over, Vay returned to Budapest and his journalism career. Though he wrote to correspondents expressing frustration with loneliness, lack of recognition, and financial difficulties, Vay had his greatest success between 1900 and 1910. He compiled over 400 stories and published them in 15 volumes, becoming a popular and well-established author. In 1906, he began working as a merchant in Rijeka. He sold coffee and imported goods, and wrote and distributed a free newspaper called the K√°v√© Ujs√°g (Coffee News). Though initially promising, his business failed and he returned to journalism. In 1908, a street in his home town was named Count S√°ndor Vay, in his honor and the following year, he published 10 volumes of Gr√≥f Vay S√°ndor munk√°i (The Works of Count S√°ndor Vay). After 1910, newspaper and book publishers were reluctant to publish Vay's works. He moved to Switzerland and wrote stories which were published in the Sunday edition of Pesti H√≠rlap. Living in Z√ºrich at the beginning of World War I, he became stranded, but for three years was able to continue sending articles to Hungary for publication. Death and legacy In March 1918, suffering from pneumonia, Vay was admitted to hospital. After undergoing surgery, he died of pleurisy on 23 May 1918 in Lugano. Obituaries in Hungary lamented his passing and called him \\"Hungary's George Sand\\", emphasizing the loss his death would be to Hungarian literature. In 1929, his brother, who had become a missionary of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin of Assisi proposed a memorial be built to Vay in their home town. It was not realized, and though the \\"Count\\" was stricken from the street named in Vay's honor during Hungary's Soviet period, it was restored in 1989. Vay's legal case was an influential one in the development of medical analysis of lesbians. The case was studied and published in journals by eminent sexologists, including Havelock Ellis and Richard von Krafft-Ebing. Sociologist and historian Hanna Hacker has described Vay as an archetype for the development of medical and psychiatric construction of the characteristics of lesbian identity and a model of butch women for the development of the field of sexology. The case itself marked the first time that passing had been judged on a medical basis rather than a legal/moral one. It also represented a shift from using punishment as a means of restoring social norms to an approach which attempted to understand and explain the underlying causes of anti-social behavior. The influence of the case was not limited to the medical profession, as \\"Simone de Beauvoir based her comments on lesbianism in The Second Sex on Vay's story\\". Vay's literary legacy influenced many Hungarian writers, including , Kinga Fab√≥, G√©za Gy√≥ni, Frigyes Karinthy, Gyula Kr√∫dy, Istv√°n √ñrk√©ny, and Zsuzsa Rakovszky. S√°ndor We√∂res attempted to produce a drama about Vay in the 1970s, but was unable to publish it. Vay's own works were successfully republished posthumously. In 1918, his Pestv√°rmegyei hist√≥ri√°k (Stories of Pestv√°r County), originally published in 1907 was republished and in 1924, his 10-volume Gr√≥f Vay S√°ndor munk√°i (The Works of Count S√°ndor Vay) was re-released. In 1926 Singer and Wolfner Publishing re- bound R√©gi nemes urak, √∫rasszonyok: hist√≥ri√°k, legend√°k, virtusos cselekedetek (Old Noble Gentlemen, Gentlewomen: Stories, Legends, Virtuous Deeds) published originally in 1908, for distribution by the Ministry of Religion and Public Education. In 1986, √Ågota Steinert edited and published selections from the 1900 publication R√©gi magyar t√°rsas√©let (Old Hungarian Social Life). In 2000, J√≥zsef Radnai, published Vay Sarolta: Levelek a buck√°b√≥l (Sarolta Vay: Letters from the Mound), which contained a carefully researched compilation of 19 stories by Vay. Additional works such as Eur√≥pa b√°l (European Ball, 2006), Vir√°g borul minden r√∂gre: versek (Flowers Fall on Every Nugget: Poems, 2009) and Nemzeti √ñr√∂ks√©g (National Heritage, 2012) were also posthumously published. Steinert, a literary historian, notes that while textbooks can relay history, Vay remains relevant as his works convey an intimate knowledge of his age.

It was the landing site of the expedition under Yves de Kerguelen in 1772, and later of the expedition under James Cook in 1776. The site of Port-Christmas is part of the bay.  Geography  The bay is located at the extreme North of the Kerguelen archipelago, and open towards the East, between Cap Fran√ßais at the North, and the cape of Kerguelen Arch which closes it on the South, and distinguishes it from the neighbouring Baie de la Dauphine. It is 3.8 km long and 2.1 km wide at its largest. The 552-metre Mont Havergal dominates the site and shelters it from the wind. In the 19th century, it was used as a haven for whaling and seal hunting ships.  Discovery  Kerguelen could see the side during his first voyage in February 1772, but could not land, and anchored at the South, in Baie du Lion-Marin, where he claimed the archipelago for France. In his second voyage, in December 1773, he entered the harbour and named in Baie de l'Oiseau, after the frigate Oiseau, under Rosnovet, one of the ships of the expedition. On 6 January 1774, he sent Rochegude ashore to leave a bottle with a message claiming the site for France. On 2 January 1893, Commander Lieutard, of aviso Eure, renewed the claim.  Fauna and flora  The flora is limited to moss and lichens in a tundra ecosystem, as well as a cane grass at the mouth of the spillway of Lake Rochegude. There are no trees or bushes, which inspired Cook to call the Islands \\"Desolation islands\\" when he visited in 1776. His surgeon, William Anderson, had however noted the existence Pringlea at the Bay, a source of Vitamin C of interest at a time when scurvy was a common sanitary problem for sailors. During the Ross expedition of 1840, Doctor McCormick, exploring Mount Havergal, found fossilised tree trunk, proving the existence of forests in a previous geological era. The bay is home to temporary colonies of King Penguins and a variety of other birds, such as petrels or albatrosses, which nest in the cliffs of the bay, as well as colonies of South American sea lions and Southern elephant seal. Rabbit were deliberately introduced in 1874, and have since been observed in the cliffs of Port-Christmas. Southern right whales have also be seen near the bay, and on the North-Western shores of the archipelago.

History  In the 1930s, the New York State Department of Transportation built the Bethpage State Parkway to help residents of nearby New York City access Long Island parks. In the 1970s, the Department of Transportation built the original 6.8 mile path from the Massapequa Preserve to the Bethpage State Park playground and parking area to connect the preserve and Massapequa. The Department of Transportation did not build any new paths north of this point; however bikers and trail walkers walked north on a dirt path. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the Department of Transportation rewarded a contract to began new work on the trail, adding an additional 5.7 miles from the playgrounds and parking area north to nearby Syosset through the Trail View State Park right of way. The reasoning behind the paved extension is to \\"further provide non- motorized access to recreational and employment facilities along the length of the bikeway and to improve air quality by converting some motorized traffic into non-motorized traffic.\\"  Route  The southern terminus of the bikeway is at the northeast corner of Merrick Road and Ocean Avenue in the Massapequa Preserve, although barely marked with signage. It continues north and briefly runs alongside the Massapequa Creek until it empties out onto the southern side of Sunrise Highway. As the trail filters into the highway mid-block, trail users generally cross at Lakeshore Boulevard. From there, the trail continues north inside the preserve, east of the creek and its several ponds; here there are several spurs onto Lake Shore Drive. The trail then crosses Linden Street and curves over the Southern State Parkway onto the eastern side of the Bethpage State Parkway. It continues like this for the entirety of the parkway at which point it enters Bethpage State Park. Inside the park, the trail runs alongside Plainview Road, and then the Picnic Polo Road. The path has a spur running into the parking lot for the playground area. This is where the 1970s-era path ends and the 2010s-era path begins. Here, the trail has mile markers every 0.1 mile and follows Jo Ann Drive and South Park Drive, with many other dirt paths, notably the Long Island Greenbelt Trail paths and the Concerned Long Island Mountain Bikers (CLIMB) trails. After crossing Haypath Road, the trail enters Trail View State Park and steadily stays on the eastern side of the park before reaching the northern \\"end\\" of the park, crossing Washington Avenue at Executive Drive. It briefly runs alongside the western side of Washington Avenue before hitting the North Service Road of the Long Island Expressway where it runs adjacent to it until its intersection with Sunnyside Boulevard. The trail finally ends at Woodbury Road and Sunnyside Boulevard's Extension; however the trail also ends at Woodbury Road and Manetto Hill Road.

It is recognized as a world leader in the review of published tests. Following the founder's death in 1978, his widow Luella Buros moved the centre to its current location and expanded Buros' original focus by including coverage of Spanish tests, providing test reviews through academic databases and online download, and more generally advancing the quality of testing. The center maintains a public library of tests published after 1929 and also provides consultation and training related to testing. The Buros Center comprises three distinct units that, together, provide unique products and services for the testing and assessment community. The Test Reviews and Information unit publishes three reference volume series‚ÄîThe Mental Measurements Yearbook, Tests in Print, and Pruebas Publicadas en Espa√±ol: An Index of Spanish Tests in Print‚Äîthat offer descriptive information and critical appraisals of commercially available tests. The Psychometric Consulting unit offers consultation services that assist proprietary testing programs in improving the quality of their programs and validity of results. The Psychometric Consulting unit also offers auditing and accreditation services for licensure and certification tests. The Assessment Literacy unit develops programming and collaborative research to deepen the understanding of testing and assessment practices.  History  Oscar Krisen Buros (1906-1978), was a professor of measurement and statistics in the Rutgers School of Education when he published a comprehensive review of psychological tests in 1938, called the Mental Measurements Yearbook (MMY). It has been updated regularly ever since, with 19 subsequent editions through 2017. In a profile in Time in 1939, Buros explained that he relied upon outside experts to provide reviews, utilizing 133 reviewers in the first edition, and 245 for the second edition. He indicated that he was motivated to start the project due to his belief that nine out of ten published tests were unreliable. He indicated that he was sometimes threatened with lawsuits from test publishers. Towards the end of his career, he allowed that about half of the published tests had become were worthy of publication. Over the course of his 40-year editorship of the MMY, Oscar and his wife Luella published eight MMYs, and also began publishing a cumulative reference book, Tests in Print, in 1961, and a series of monographs on specialized tests. The MMY has been updated regularly since 1938. Upon his death, the Buros Institute of Mental Measurement moved to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, where it has remained. It was renamed the Buros Center for Testing in 1994.  Products and Services  The center's reviews provide detailed information and critical test appraisal targeted towards professionals, written by independent reviewers who fulfill their requirement of doctoral-level education with a background in psychometrics. The reviews are available by the following means: = Mental Measurements Yearbook = Main Entry: Mental Measurements Yearbook A series of reference books that provide periodic updates covering English language tests that have been published or changed since the prior edition.

She is notable as having claimed territories of the Southern Indian Ocean for France, including the Kerguelen Islands in 1893. She continued to serve in the Pacific until 1901.  Career  Construction of Eure began in 1886 at the Ateliers et chantiers du Havre. She was part of a 1885 order comprising six other avisos of the same class (Meurthe, Dr√¥me, Aube, Durance, Rance and Manche), designed as mixed sail and steam ships. Eure was launched on 5 April 1886, and commissioned on 14 August 1890 at Rochefort, where she was based. President Sadi Carnot sent Eure on a mission to claim the French Southern and Antarctic Lands for France. On 1 January 1893, Eure entered Baie de l'Oiseau, North of Kerguelen Islands. Commander Lieutard, the commanding officer, held a ceremony at Port-Christmas the next day, where a copper plaque inscribed ¬´ EURE - 1893 ¬ª was set. He repeated this in various locations of the archipelago in the following 15 days. Eure continued her claims at √Æle Saint-Paul on 22 January 1893, and at √Æle Amsterdam on 24 January, before returning to R√©union and Madagascar. In 1897, under Alphonse Lecuve, Eure toured New Guinea and Brisbane, finally arriving at Noum√©a in New Caledonia. From then on, she was attached to the French Pacific Fleet.

He did not race as a two-year-old in 2016 but in the following year he won four minor races. As a four-year-old he won the Yasuda Kinen as well as finishing second in the Hankyu Hai, Yomiuri Milers Cup and Swan Stakes. He failed to win in 2019 but returned to winning form when switched to race on dirt in 2020, taking the Negishi Stakes and the February Stakes Background Mozu Ascot is a chestnut with a white star and stripe and three white socks bred in Kentucky by the Summer Wind Farm. As a yearling in September 2015 he was put up for auction at the Keeneland Association sale but failed to reach his reserve price of $275,000. He was subsequently exported to Japan where he was sent into training with Yoshito Yahagi and carried the yellow and black colours of Capital System Co Ltd. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Frankel, an undefeated racehorse whose other progeny have included Cracksman, Anapurna, Soul Stirring and Without Parole. Mozu Ascot's dam, the Kentucky-bred India, showed high-class racing ability earning over $600,000 and winning six races including the 2006 Cotillion Stakes. She was a great-great-granddaughter of the broodmare Golden Trail (foaled 1958) whose other descendants have included Brian's Time and Monarchos. Racing career2017: three-year-old season= Mozu Ascot was unraced as a two-year-old and began his track career on 10 June 2017 by finishing fourth in a maiden race over 2000 metres at Hanshin Racecourse and then came home fourth in a similar event over 1800 metres at the same venue two weeks later. The colt then ran up a four-race winning sequence, beginning with a victory in a 1600-metre maiden at Chukyo Racecourse in July. He returned from a two-month break and added to his tally by taking a minor race over the same distance at Hanshin in September, the Mitaka Tokubetsu over 1400 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 11 November and the Togetsukyo Stakes at Kyoto Racecourse fifteen days later. For his final run of the season, Mozu Ascot was stepped up in class for the Grade 2 Hanshin Cup on 23 December. Ridden by Cristian Demuro he was made the 2.2/1 favourite but finished fourth behind the six-year-old Isla Bonita, beaten two and a half lengths by the winner. In the official Japanese Thoroughbred rankings for 2017 Mozu Ascot was given a rating of 107, making him the 42nd best three-year-old on turf, fourteen pounds behind the top-rated Rey de Oro. =2018: four-year- old season= Mozu Ascot's regular jockey Christophe Lemaire Christophe Lemaire was Mozu Ascot's regular jockey for the 2018 season which began on 25 February at Hanshin when the colt was beaten a neck by the five-year-old mare Diana Halo when favourite for the Grade 3 Hankyu Hai. In his next two starts he was runner-up to Sungrazer in the Grade 2 Yomiuri Milers Cup at Kyoto on 22 April and then ran second for the third time in a row when beaten by Daimei Fuji in the Listed Azuchijo Stakes over 1400 metres at the same track on 27 May. Commenting on the horse's losing run Yahagi commented \\"luck wasn‚Äôt on his side... there is no doubt that he has talent and potential... this colt is still just a kid even though he is maturing bit by bit\\". On 3 June Mozu Ascot was moved up to Grade 1 level for the first time and started at odds of 14.7/1 for the 68th running of the Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres at Tokyo. Suave Richard went off favourite while the other fourteen runners included Persian Knight (Mile Championship), Sungrazer, Real Steel, Aerolithe (NHK Mile Cup), Lys Gracieux, Satono Ares (Asahi Hai Futurity Stakes), Red Falx (Sprinters Stakes) and Reine Minoru (Oka Sho). Lemaire settled his mount in mid-division before dropping back towards the rear after being hampered and turning into the straight in twelfth place. Win Gagnant, who had set the pace for most of the way, faded in the straight and Aerolithe went to the front only to be challenged immediately by Suave Richard to her right and Satono Ares on the wide outside. Mozu Ascot however, having raced on the inside rail, angled to the right in last 100 metres before threading his way through a gap between the leaders, overtaking Aerolithe in the final strides and winning by a neck. Lemaire commented \\"I didn't have any specific plan before the race... I also didn't plan whether to go inside or outside. As a result, the space became narrow, and we were bumped and pushed towards the inside. I didn't want him to lose his balance, so I waited... Once I found a gap, I asked for full power from the horse with my whip, and he responded very well and kept on strongly to the finish line\\". After a break of well over four months Mozu Ascot returned on 27 October at Kyoto when he started odds-on favourite for the Swan Stakes but was beaten a nose by the five-year-old Lord Quest. Despite his defeat he was made the 2.4/1 favourite for the Grade 1 Mile Championship at the same track on 18 November but finished thirteenth of the eighteen runners, four lengths behind the winner Stelvio, after being unable to obtain a clear run in the straight. He ended his season on 9 December when he finished seventh behind Beauty Generation in the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin Racecourse. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Mozu Ascot was given a rating of 118, making him 78th best horse in the world. =2019: five-year-old season= Mozu Ascot began his third campaign on 21 April when he ran seventh behind Danon Premium in the Yomiuri Milers Cup. His assistant trainer Shigeki Miyauchi said \\"he was too excitable, not like before. He's easily startled by noises\\". On 2 June he started at odds of 34/1 as he attempted to repeat his 2018 victory in the Yasuda Kinen and finished sixth of the sixteen runners behind Indy Champ beaten just over two lengths by the winner. After a four- month break he returned to the track at Tokyo in October and came home sixth behind Danon Kingly in the Mainichi Okan. Later that month he contested the Swan Stakes for the second time and, as in 2018 he was narrowly defeated, going down by a nose to the four-year-old favourite Diatonic. He ended his season in the Mile Championship on 17 November when he started a 18.9/1 outsider and finished fourteenth of the seventeen runners, beaten seven and a half lengths by the winner Indy Champ. =2020: six-year-old season= Indy Champ's trainer Yoshito Yanagi Having raced on turf throughout his career, Mozu Ascot was switched to dirt at the start of 2020. He made his first appearance on the new surface in the Negishi Stakes over 1400 metres at Tokyo on 2 February and started at odds of 8.9/1 in a sixteen-runner field which also included Copano Kicking (winner of the race in 2019 and twice victorious in the Capella Stakes), Wide Pharaoh (Unicorn Stakes) and Wonder Lider (Musashino Stakes). Ridden by Lemaire he produced a sustained run on the outside in the straight, caught Copano Kicking in the final strides, and won by one and a quarter lengths. Yahagi subsequently commented \\"It was a strong win for him, especially having to carry 58kg... he's a horse that needs a bit of care, as he has his own character\\". Three weeks later Mozu Ascot contested his first Grade 1 on dirt when he started the 1.8/1 favourite for the February Stakes over 1600 metres at Tokyo. His fifteen opponents included Inti (winner of the race in 2019), Nonkono Yume (winner in 2018), Sunrise Nova (Unicorn Stakes, Musashino Stakes), Arctos (Procyon Stakes), Vengeance (Miyako Stakes), Time Flyer (Hopeful Stakes), Bulldog Boss (JBC Sprint), K T Brave (JBC Classic), Wide Pharaoh and Wonder Lider. After settling behind the leaders and turning into the straight in sixth place, Mozu Ascot made a forward move to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and drew away to win by two and a half lengths from K T Brave. After the race Lemaire commented \\"He broke well and we were able to settle right behind Inti as planned. His acceleration was extraordinary. Although he is a newcomer in dirt racing, he adapted immediately to the surface and gave his best today\\". Mozu Ascot was scheduled to contest the Doncaster Handicap in Australia but quarantine measures imposed after the COVID-19 outbreak meant that he remained in Japan and was dropped back to 1200 metres on turf for the Takamatsunomiya Kinen at Chukyo on 29 March. He raced towards the rear before making some progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home thirteenth of the eighteen runners behind Mozu Superflare. The horse returned to the dirt for the Listed Kashiwa Kinen over 1600 metres at Funabashi Racecourse on 5 May when he finished sixth behind Wide Pharaoh.

Gorshkov served in the final stages of the Russian Civil War as a cadet, holding command and staff positions with cavalry units in Ukraine during the interwar period. When Operation Barbarossa began, he was commander of the 206th Rifle Division, which was destroyed during the Battle of Kiev. Gorshkov escaped the encirclement and was sent to the North Caucasus to command the new 15th Cavalry Division. Decorated for his command of the division, converted into the 11th Guards Cavalry Division, in the Battle of the Caucasus, Gorshkov served as a corps deputy commander during 1943 and early 1944. Afterwards, he became commander of the 5th Guards Cavalry Corps, which he led for the remainder of the war. Due to illness, Gorshkov retired shortly after its end.  Early life and Russian Civil War  Gorshkov was born on 20 September 1902 on the khutor of Olshanka, Don Host Oblast. During the Russian Civil War, the area was occupied by the Armed Forces of South Russia until August 1919, and Gorshkov remained engaged in agricultural work. Conscripted into the Red Army in September 1920, he was sent to study at the 7th Borisoglebsk Cavalry Course. With a cadet detachment drawn from the course, Gorshkov fought in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion as a squad leader. For his actions in the fighting, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner.  Interwar period  Resuming his studies in September 1921 after the merger of the Borisoglebsk Course into what became the 2nd Borisoglebsk-Petrograd Cavalry School, Gorshkov graduated a year later and was appointed a platoon commander in the 73rd Rifle Regiment of the 25th Rifle Division and the divisional cavalry squadron, stationed at Chigirin, Kremenchug, and Poltava. In April 1926 he was transferred to the 51st Cavalry Regiment of the 9th Cavalry Division at Gaisin, with which he served successively as a platoon commander in the regimental school, squadron political officer, squadron commander and political officer, and assistant regimental chief of staff.

Later that month, he was appointed commander of the 15th Don Cossack Cavalry Division, forming in the North Caucasus. In July 1942 the division joined the North Caucasian Front and fought in the Battle of the Caucasus. For distinguishing itself, the division was converted into the 11th Guards Cavalry Division on 27 August, while Gorshkov received the Order of Lenin for his leadership, continuing in command of the 11th Guards. In late 1942 it joined the Black Sea Group of Forces of the Transcaucasian Front, defending the passes of the Greater Caucasus and then in actions in the Rostov-on-Don region. He was evaluated as a \\"competent, bold, and decisive commander\\" by his superiors for his leadership of the division. Gorshkov served as deputy commander of the 5th Guards Don Cossack Cavalry Corps of the Southern Front from May 1943. During the Donbass Strategic Offensive in September, the corps broke through German defenses on the Kalmius, recapturing Volnovakha and Gulyai Pole.

It was announced on 25 November 2019 and was released on 12 December 2019. The Huawei MatePad Pro comes with considerable improvements over its predecessor, that is, the Huawei MatePad. Improvements include a better display, faster processor and better-charging speed. The tablet was met with mainly positive reviews from critics, who praised the phones aspect ratio, vibrant display, sound, and its multitasking capabilities, however, criticism was poured at the device's mediocre camera and lack of a wide variety of apps, the latter of which, is the result of the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war. The U.S. banned Huawei from using Google Services by putting Huawei on its \\"Entity List\\". This then prompted Huawei to start using their own in-house apps from the EMUI suite.  Specifications  Hardware = The MatePad Pro connected to a bluetooth keyboard to allow for a desktop-like experience The MatePad Pro has a 10.8 inch LCD QHD (2560√ó1600) display featuring 16 million colours on a 16:10 aspect ratio, resulting in the screen-to-body ratio to be approximately ~86.5% with a 90 Hz refresh rate. In-house, the tablet features one of the latest Kirin SoC's, the HiSilicon Kirin 990 5G (7nm+) octa-core processor, which is backed by a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) that optimizes the devices speed and functionality using artificial intelligence. Additionally, either 6 or 8GBs of RAM (type LPDDRX4) are used to hold volatile memory. For graphic rendering, the MatePad Pro has one of the latest Mali GPU's, the Mali G76-MP16, which is powered by the non-removable Li-Polymer 7250mAh battery. Unfortunately, the device has no headphone jack , but Huawei compensated for this by adding a 4 stereo audio channel. The tablet has a glass front, aluminium back and an aluminium frame, and also supports Fast Charging of up to 40W, Fast Wireless Charging of up to 15W and Reverse Wireless Charging of up to 7.5W. The Huawei MatePad Pro comes in a 128GB, 256GB and 512GB variant; its storage can be expanded via Huawei's proprietary Nano Memory of up to 256GBs. Available colours for the tablet are, Orange, Green, Grey and White. = Camera = Rear view of the MatePad Pro showing its camera and one of the available variant colours, Orange. The main camera is 13MPs with an aperture of f/1.8. Features of the rear camera are, PDAF, an LED flash, HDR and panorama. It can video 4K@30fps and 1080p@30fps. The front camera is a miniature punch-hole on the top right corner of the device and is 8MPs with an aperture of f/2.0 featuring HDR and video recording of 1080p quality @30fps. = Software = Due to the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, Huawei stopped pre- installing Google Services on their latest devices, and so, started promoting the use of their own software, EMUI and Huawei Mobile Services (HMS). The MatePad Pro comes with EMUI 10.1 based on the source code of Android 10, and offers a new Always On Display, a replacement assistant to the Google Assistant named Celia and a new video chat application called, Huawei Meetime. The software also recognizes and supports air gestures that are made by the user with the re-designed M-Pen (similar to that of Samsung's S-Pen). The tablet supports multitasking of up to two apps and is capable of downloading desktop applications like FireFox, which would not readily be supported, nor available on a tablet or smartphone.Huawei has also started pre-installing, promoting and emphasizing use of their new app distribution platform called the 'Huawei AppGallery' on their electronics which lack Google Play.  Reception  The MatePad Pro was generally well received by critics, who praised the device's 16:10 aspect ratio, colourful display, fast wireless charging feature, its seamless multitasking capabilities and its desktop-like experience. However, reviewers did give the camera and the devices lack of a wide variety app selection a negative welcome.

Early designs  XP-47 (AP-10) = In response to a USAAC requirement for a new fighter aircraft, Republic Aviation engineer Alexander Kartveli proposed the AP-10 lightweight high-altitude interceptor on August 1, 1939. As originally proposed, the AP-10 was to have been powered by a 1,150 hp Allison V-1710-39 12-cylinder inline engine and have an armament consisting of two nose-mounted .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns. Maximum speed was estimated to be 415 mph, while gross weight was to be 4,900 lb. The USAAC was impressed by the AP-10 proposal, but expressed concerns that it would be underarmed. Kartveli revised the AP-10 by slightly increasing its size and mounting two .30 in (7.62 mm) M1919 Browning machine guns in each wing, raising the gross weight to 6,570 lb. Satisfied, the USAAC ordered a single prototype under the designation XP-47, in November 1939. = XP-47A = In addition to the XP-47, the USAAC also ordered another prototype as the XP-47A. This prototype was ordered without military equipment, allowing for it to be finished and tested before the XP-47. In early 1940, combat reports from war in Europe indicated that the P-47 was inferior to Luftwaffe fighters. In response, the USAAC issued new requirements for a fighter including an airspeed of 400 mph at 25,000 ft, an armament of six or (preferably) eight .50 in machine guns, cockpit armor plating, self- sealing fuel tanks, and a minimum fuel load of 315 gallons. Expecting the USAAC to reject the XP-47 for the more suitable Curtiss XP-46, Republic canceled the XP-47 and XP-47A and Kartveli began an extensive redesign of the aircraft.  Razorback Thunderbolts  P-47B = Eleventh production P-47B-RE, s/n 41-5905, with both the sliding canopy and original rear-cockpit windows. On June 12, 1940, Kartveli submitted the redesigned AP-10 to the USAAC. The new aircraft was much larger than the original, and the inline engine was swapped for a turbo-supercharged Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder radial engine. Armament was increased to eight M2 Brownings, four mounted in each wing, making it one of the heaviest-armed fighter considered by the USAAC at the time. The expected performance met USAAC requirements, however, its fuel load fell slightly short. Despite this, the USAAC ordered a prototype of the improved design as the XP-47B, on September 6, 1940. The XP-47B was first flown on May 6, 1941. It was powered by a 1,960 hp XR-2800-21 engine and featured an elliptical wing, an all-metal construction (except for the fabric-covered control surfaces), and a hinged canopy. The main landing gear retracted inward into the wings, telescoping nine inches to clear the underside of the fuselage, and the steerable tailwheel was fully retractable. With a loaded weight of 12,086 lb, the XP-47B was almost twice as heavy as its competitors. Performance was higher than expected with a maximum speed of 412 mph. The XP-47B crashed on August 8, 1942, however, an order for 773 production aircraft had been placed almost two years before on September 13, 1940. The production aircraft, designated P-47B, differed from the prototype in that they were powered by a 2,000 hp production R-2800-21 engine, a sliding canopy in place of the original hinged unit, and redesigned metal ailerons and elevators. Only 171 of the original order were completed as P-47Bs before production switched to the P-47C. The aircraft's nickname, Thunderbolt, was created by Republic's Director of Military Contracts, C. Hart Miller.  Sub-variants and modifications  * XP-47B, single prototype powered by a 1,960 hp XR-2800-21 engine. * P-47B-RE, 171 aircraft powered by a 2,000 hp R-2800-21 engine with other modifications. * RP-47B, designation originally applied to a handful of P-47B modified into photo-reconnaissance aircraft with a camera mounted in the port intercooler vent. Later applied to all P-47Bs in 1944 to denote its status as restricted from combat. = XP-47E = The sole XP-47E, s/n 41-6065 The final P-47B was converted in September 1942 into a prototype for a high-altitude variant as the XP-47E. Modifications included a pressurized cockpit with a hinged canopy. The project was canceled due to increased emphasis on low-level operations over Europe. = XP-47F = Another P-47B was fitted with a larger-area laminar-flow wing as the XP-47F. The XP-47F was first flown on September 17, 1942, but project was ultimately canceled when the aircraft crashed and no production aircraft followed. = P-47C = P-47C-2-RE, s/n 41-6182 Several improvements were incorporated into the Thunderbolt starting with the 172nd production aircraft on September 14, 1942. The resulting P-47C featured a redesigned metal rudder, as the original fabric-covered unit was prone to tail flutter which frequently led to crashes. A revised oxygen system was fitted, as were new SCR-274-N and SCR-515-A radios. The main external difference between the P-47B and C was the upright antenna mast, which replaced the B's forward-swept mast. The C variant was built in four production blocks totaling 602 aircraft, with production ending in February 1943 when Republic's Farmingdale, New York plant switched to the P-47D.  Sub-variants  * P-47C-RE, initial production block as described above. 58 built. * P-47C-1-RE, with 8-inch fuselage extension to move the center of gravity, improving flight characteristics. Minor changes to the main undercarriage were made, and tailwheel steering was omitted. Other minor changes were made to the turbo-supercharger air duct, elevator control system, and controls. 54 built, plus one P-47C-RE modified as the prototype. * P-47C-2-RE, with shackles on the underside for a bomb or drop tank. 128 built. * P-47C-5-RE, with cockpit heating, as well as a revised radio, instruments, and the antenna mast was replaced by a whip antenna (photographic evidence shows that some C-5-REs and future razorback variants were fitted with either the mast or whip antenna, with no apparent standard). 362 built. = P-47D (razorback) = 'Astra', a two-seat conversion of a P-47D assigned to the 365th Fighter Group. Apparent are the underwing pylons introduced on the P-47D-15. On October 14, 1941, the USAAF (successor to the USAAC) ordered an additional 850 P-47s. Unable to keep up with the demand with their main plant in Farmingdale, New York, Republic built a new plant in Evansville, Indiana. Production of P-47Cs in the new plant were designated P-47D-RA, with the first aircraft rolling off the production line in September 1942. The initial production block was based on the P-47C-2-RE or C-5-RE, but with two additional cowl flaps (for a total of five) on each side (this was absent on early aircraft, making them indistinguishable from P-47Cs). Internal changes included extra cockpit armor and changes to the turbo-supercharger exhaust system. Eventually, these changes would be incorporated into the Farmingdale- built aircraft, these designated P-47D-1-RE. 21 production blocks of the \\"razorback\\" P-47D, totaling 9,530 aircraft, would be built by both plants before production switched to the \\"bubbletop\\" D-variant.  Sub-variants  * An early P-47D-RA, s/n 42-22281 'Aloe Al', with three cowl flaps per side. This was later changed to five.P-47D-RA, P-47C-2-RE or C-5-RE built at Evansville. Later extra cowl flaps and minor changes were added. 114 built including pre-production aircraft. Sometimes referred to as the P-47D-1-RA. * P-47D-1-RE, Farmingdale equivalent of the late-P-47D-RA. 105 built. * P-47D-2-RE, with turbo-supercharger shroud removed. 445 built. * P-47D-2-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-2-RE. 200 built. * P-47D-3-RA, with minor changes. 100 built. * P-47D-4-RA, with a GE C-21 supercharger and water injection. Not quite up to C-5-RE standard. 200 built. * P-47D-5-RE, with a GE C-21 supercharger and water injection as well as improved B-7 bomb/drop tank shackles. Later aircraft featured notches in the lower cowl flaps. 300 built. * P-47D-6-RE, with minor electrical system changes. 350 built. * P-47D-10-RE, with a 2,300 hp R-2800-63 engine and an improved GE C-23 supercharger. Changes were made to the flaps as well as the cooling, oil, and hydraulic systems. 250 built. * P-47D-11-RE, with an automatic water injection procedure in place of the manual control of the previous blocks. 400 built. * P-47D-11-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-11-RE. 250 built. * P-47D-15-RE, with underwing pylons and a completely jettisonable canopy. 446 built. * P-47D-15-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-15-RE. 157 built. * P-47D-16-RE, minor fuel system changes. 254 built. * P-47D-16-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-16-RE. 29 built. * P-47D-20-RE, with 2,300 hp R-2800-59 engine, new \\"universal\\" wing pylons designed to carry a greater of bombs and drop tanks, and other minor changes. 299 built. * P-47D-20-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-20-RE. 187 built. * P-47D-21-RE, changes to water injection button on throttle. 216 built. * P-47D-21-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-21-RE. 224 built. * P-47D-22-RE, with a 13' \\" Hamilton Standard Hydramatic 24E50-65 propeller in place of the original 12' 2\\" Curtiss Electric unit. 850 built. * P-47D-23-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-22-RE, but with a 13' Curtiss Electric C542S propeller. 889 built. *Thunderbolt Mk I, designation of P-47D-22-REs in RAF service. Some aircraft were fitted with Malcolm Hood canopies to improve visibility. = P-47G = Airworthy P-47G-10-CU, s/n 42-25068 'Snafu', at the 2012 Duxford Air Show. Even with the second plant, Republic was still having trouble keeping up with the ever increasing orders for Thunderbolts. Curtiss-Wright, which recently prepared its Buffalo, New York plant for mass production of its P-60A before their contract was canceled, was awarded another contract to produce the P-47 as the P-47G. The first delivery of a Curtiss-Wright-built P-47G was in December 1942. In all, Curtiss-Wright built 354 P-47Gs in five production blocks before production ended in March 1944.  Sub-variants  * P-47G-CU, identical to the P-47C-RE. 20 built. * P-47G-1-CU, identical to the P-47C-1-RE. 40 built. * P-47G-5-CU, similar to the P-47D-1-RE but with minor changes. 60 built. * P-47G-10-CU, identical to the P-47D-5-RE. 80 built. * P-47G-15-CU, identical to the P-47D-10-RE. 154 built. * TP-47G \\"Doublebolt\\", two P-47G-15-CUs were modified on the production line as prototypes for a trainer variant of the P-47. A second cockpit was added in front of the original, taking the place of the main fuselage fuel tank. Nicknamed \\"Doublebolt\\", these were the only factory-built two-seat P-47 trainers, though a few P-47Ds are known to have been fitted with a second seat as a field modification. = XP-47H = The first XP-47H, s/n 42-23297 In an attempt to improve the performance of the Thunderbolt, Republic began a project to install a 2,300 hp Chrysler XIV-2220-1 16-cylinder inverted-V engine in two P-47D-15-RE airframes in August 1943. The resulting XP-47H had a new streamlined nose with a large intake and was expected to have a maximum speed of 490 mph. While sources do not agree whether the aircraft met the speed expectations or fell short, by the time the aircraft were modified in 1945, the Jet Age was beginning and the USAAF was losing interest in piston-engined fighters, and the XP-47H project was canceled. = XP-47J = XP-47J, s/n 43-46952 A similar attempt to improve performance resulted in the XP-47J. Unlike the XP-47H, the sole XP-47J was a newly built airframe, with many changes to reduce weight. The aircraft was fitted with a 2,800 hp R-2800-57C engine with a CH-5 supercharger, housed in a redesigned streamlined cowling. Armament was reduced to six M2 Brownings. The XP-47J was first flown on November 26, 1943, and on August 4, 1944, it became the first piston-engined fighter to exceed 500 mph, with a speed of 504 mph, making it the fastest Thunderbolt variant. A production version of the XP-47J was canceled in favor of another Thunderbolt development, the XP-72, as were plans for installing an R-2800-61 engine with contra-rotating propellers.  Bubbletop Thunderbolts  XP-47K/L = XP-47K, s/n 42-8702, the first bubbletop Thunderbolt A common complaint from P-47 pilots was that the razorback cockpit limited rearward visibility. In response to these complaints, Republic fitted a bubble canopy from a Hawker Typhoon onto a P-47D-5-RE in July 1943. Designated XP-47K, the aircraft's new canopy improved visibility greatly. Another \\"bubbletop\\" prototype was modified from a P-47D-20-RE as the XP-47L, differing from the XP-47K in that it had an increased fuel capacity. For reasons unknown, the first production bubbletop Thunderbolts were not given a new variant letter, instead they were a continuation of the P-47D line. = P-47D (bubbletop) = Production of the bubbletop Thunderbolt began with the P-47D-25-RE at Farmingdale and the P-47D-26-RA at Evansville. These aircraft were based on the XP-47L with increased fuel capacity. Bubbletop P-47D production totaled 3,028 aircraft, built in eight production blocks, for a grand total of 12,558 P-47Ds.  Sub-variants  * P-47D-25-RE, based on the XP-47L, but with a 13' \\" Hamilton Standard propeller. 385 built. * P-47D-26-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-25-RE, but with a 13' Curtiss Electric propeller. 250 built. * P-47D-27-RE, with an improved water injection system and drop tank controls as well as a new starter. 615 built. * P-47D-28-RE, with minor changes to the cockpit and a radio direction finder. The Curtiss Electric propeller of Evansville-built aircraft was now standard for both production lines. 750 built. * P-47D-28-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-28-RE. 1,028 built. * P-47D-30-RE, with dive brakes and many minor changes. 800 built, orders for 130 more were converted to orders for the P-47M-1-RE. * P-47D-30-RA, Evansville equivalent of the D-30-RE. 1,800 built. * P-40D-40-RA, with dorsal fin added forward of the vertical stabilizer along with a tail warning radar. 665 built. *Thunderbolt Mk II, designation of P-47D-25/-30-REs and P-47D-30/-40-RAs in RAF service. = P-47M = YP-47M The appearance of the V-1 flying bomb, jet fighters such as the Messerschmitt Me 262, and rocket fighters such as the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet led Republic to begin development of a high-speed variant of the Thunderbolt. Four P-47D-27-RE were modified with a 2,800 hp R-2800-57C engine with a CH-5 supercharger and the dive brakes of the P-47D-30 as YP-47Ms. An improved 13' Curtiss Electric C542S-B40 propeller was fitted, and changes were made to increase speed. These improvements rose the top speed to 473 mph. In September 1944, the last 130 aircraft from the original P-47D-30-RE order were converted into an order for a production version of the YP-47M as the P-47M-1-RE. Deliveries began in December 1944, though engine problems delayed their combat debut until a few weeks before the end of the war in Europe. = P-47N = P-47N-25-RE, s/n 4-89403 The war in the Pacific demanded greater fighter ranges than in Europe. Therefore, the third YP-47M was fitted with a new longer-span wet wing featuring squared-off wingtips as the XP-47N. The USAAF placed an order for 1,900 P-47Ns on June 20, 1944, two days before the prototype was first flown, and many more orders followed, deliveries began in September 1944. 1,816 P-47Ns were built in six production blocks, with orders for an additional 5,934 aircraft being canceled after VJ Day. The final P-47 rolled off the production line in December 1945.  Sub-variants  * XP-47N, prototype converted from the third YP-47M. * P-47N-1-RE, initial production block. Fitted with a new dorsal fin along with other minor changes. 550 built. * P-47N-5-RE, with the tail warning radar of the P-47D-40-RE, rocket launcher stubs, and minor changes to the radio. Later aircraft were fitted with 2,800 hp R-2800-73 engines. 550 built. * P-47N-15-RE, with an R-2800-73 engine, a S-1 bomb release, a K-14 gun sight, and a redesigned pilot seat. 200 built. * P-47N-20-RE, with changes to the radio and fuel system. 200 built. * P-47N-20-RA, Evansville equivalent of the N-20-RE. 149 built. The final Thunderbolt built, s/n 45-50123, was from this production block. * P-47N-25-RE, fitted with either the R-2800-73, R-2800-77, or R-2800-81. The cockpit floor and tailwheel linkage were redesigned, along with other minor changes. 167 built. * F-47N, designation applied to all P-47Ns in service in 1947 when the USAAF broke off from the Army and became the USAF.  Further developments  XP-72 (AP-19) = The first XP-72, s/n 43-36598 Developed in parallel with the Republic XP-69, the AP-19 was proposed by Alexander Kartveli as a replacement for the P-47. The aircraft was a development of the bubbletop P-47D, but was to be powered by 3,450 hp Pratt & Whitney R-4360-13 Wasp Major 28-cylinder radial engine driving contra-rotating six-bladed Aeroproducts propellers and armed with six M2 Brownings. The USAAF ordered two prototypes on June 18, 1943. The first prototype, with a four-bladed propeller due to delayed delivery of the intended unit, was first flown on February 2, 1944, and the second prototype with the intended propeller followed on June 26 of that year. The second XP-72 crashed early in the test program, but the USAAF was impressed with its performance and placed an order for 100 production P-72 aircraft with R-4360-19 and four 37 mm cannons in place of the Brownings. However, this order was canceled as the war neared its end. = \\"Turbobolt\\" = In response to the growing number of jet powered fighters operated by the Luftwaffe, Republic began work on a turbojet powered version of the P-47. The \\"Turbobolt\\" was to have been powered by a single General Electric J31 turbojet, later changed to an Allison J35. The Thunderbolt's eight guns were to be relocated to the nose. Soon after work began, Republic engineers realized that mounting a turbojet engine onto the Thunderbolt airframe was not feasible, and even if it were, performance likely would not improve by much. Therefore, the project was canceled and never made it past the concept drawing phase. = AP-47 = In September 1948, Republic proposed a mixed-power ground attack development of the Thunderbolt. It was to be powered by an R-2800 engine in the nose and a Westinghouse 24C turbojet in the rear fuselage. However, the USAF was not interested in the design and did not order any prototypes.

It started in the 1980s under the leadership of Saddam Hussein and was to be put in LEO with the help of an Ariane 4 or al-Abid vehicle however after the Gulf War Iraq could not obtain such vehicles and could only develop the satellite. History It was in the 1980s that Iraq under Saddam Hussein sought to produce its own satellite however foreign political opposition made this difficult thus research could only formally begin in 1988 with the start of the Iraqi space program in which the development of a launch vehicle was also sought. According to the Space Applications Center of the Space Technology Directorate within Iraq‚Äôs Ministry of Science & Technology Sarmad D.S. Dawood Iraq's scientific research council established a space research center, Iraqi scientists of the research center managed to produce two identical flight- ready satellites, they also had a plan of building a tracking,control and communications station. Some sources put the names of the two identical satellites as Al-Ta'ir 1 and Al-Ta'ir 2. The Iraqis planned to put the satellite aboard an Ariane 4 rocket using the Ariane 44L vehicle as a baseline to get the satellite into a 350-400 km LEO, presumably having a low inclination in order to maximize the time they spent above the country. The only problem was that the Ariane 4 only flew to polar low Earth orbit and geostationary transfer orbit. According to Dawood the program came to a halt after the invasion of Kuwait and subsequent gulf war. According to Dawood Iraq continued designing subsystems like digital imaging cameras for more advanced satellite system such as remote sensing spacecraft from 1991-2003. Characteristics The satellite was octagonal having a height of 47 cm and a diameter of 74 cm, it had an overall weight of 75 kg, sources describe its appearance as that of a \\"1970's disco-themed coffee table\\". When it comes to the interior of the satellite, it was divided into four bays for protecting the internal electronics from the vibration of launch. The satellite was spin- stabilized and only had passive thermal protection, by black and white paint. The satellite was solar powered having seven solar batteries and an additional back-up battery. When it comes to electronics then the satellite had an onboard data management system, a radio frequency communication system that operated UHF and VHF bands which communicated voice, telemetry and telecommand data and an attitude control system.

He is known for writing scores for the Hou Hsiao-Hsien films Dust in the Wind (1985) and The Puppetmaster (1993), as well as for songs such as \\"She Is Our Darling\\" (‰ºäÊòØÂí±ÁöÑÂØ∂Ë≤ù, 1993) and \\"Wandering to Tamsui\\" (ÊµÅÊµ™Âà∞Ê∑°Ê∞¥, 1995). He is stylistically known for singing primarily in Taiwanese Hokkien, incorporating traditional styles and instruments into his music, as well as songs that represent the Taiwanese underclass.  History  Early life = Chen Ming-chang was born in 1956 in Beitou Village, Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau (now Beitou District in Taipei). Chen Ming-chang's first musical instrument was his older brother's guitar, which his mother bought for 2700 NTD as a reward for his high school admission. His brother barely used it and left it for Ming-chang, then in his 2nd year of middle school, to play with. In his youth, Chen Ming-chang hoped to become a baseball player. He was not very studious and in 1972, he was admitted to Fuxing Senior High School in Beitou and played first base for the high school team. He dreamed of going to the United States to play in the MLB. Neglecting his homework to practice baseball, it took him four years rather than the usual three to complete high school. Music was just a hobby for Chen Ming-chang until his third year in high school, when he realized that despite being slow at reading music, he had a particular sensitivity toward sound and in particular could quickly transcribe any song that he heard. He began to experiment with Western-style music and joined his school's guitar club. By his account. he would often practice from 9 P.M. to 4 or 5 A.M. every night and then sleep into the afternoon before leaving for school. To avoid demerits he would sneak into the military instructor's office and doctor the roll call sheet before going to the guitar club.  Military service and afterwards  The 70s in Taiwan saw the beginning of the campus folk song movement, and it was during this time that Chen Ming-chang's natural musical talents were stirred. After graduating from high school, he formed a musical group called the Wooden Guitar Chorus (Êú®Âêâ‰ªñÂêàÂî±Âúò), which consisted of his friends Jonathan Lee, Chang Bing-hui (ÂºµÁÇ≥Ëºù), Cheng Wen-kui (ÈÑ≠ÊñáÈ≠Å), Hu Chao-yu (ËÉ°Êò≠ÂÆá), Chen Yung-yu (Èô≥Ê∞∏Ë£ï), Chiang Hsueh-shih (Ê±üÂ≠∏‰∏ñ), et cetera. It was then that Chen began to experiment with composing music, as his singing was not good enough for the group, according to the album notes to his 1990 album An Afternoon Drama. In a 2002 interview, he said that the group would practice singing during their studies at Minghsin University of Science and Technology, but since he was serving his mandatory military service at the time he couldn't participate. After he was discharged, they already had two guitarists and had no need for another. To make a living, he worked as a merchant selling a variety of goods, such as clothing, watches and pianos. = Rise of Taiwanese consciousness (1980s) = In 1982, at age 26, Chen Ming-chang's father suffered from a stroke, and he went back to Beitou to help take care of him as well as help his mother run their jewelry store. Two years later, when his younger brother finished his military service, Ming-chang decided he would try his hand at music again. His supportive mother and sister bought him a piano and a four-track recorder. They converted the fourth floor of their house into a recording studio, where Ming-chang would teach guitar in the evenings after working in the family shop. It was during this time that Chen began to think about the question: \\"what is Taiwanese music?\\" The question was spurred by his discovery of the music of Chen Da, a Taiwanese language folk musician representative of Hengchun. Hearing Chen Da's music made Chen Ming-chang realize that his music lacked \\"a feeling for this land and a reflection on our local culture\\" and gave him a resolve to make music that belonged to Taiwan. It was around this time that Chen also learned about the 228 Incident, tearfully related to him by a drunken old man while he was on an errand in Keelung for his side business selling orchids. Since Taiwan was still under martial law at the time, Ming-chang's parents had never mentioned it to him. Not long after, Chen Ming-chang collaborated with Chen Ming-yu (Èô≥ÊòéÁëú) and wrote his first Taiwanese language song, ‚ÄúThe Chinese Cross to Taiwan\\" (ÂîêÂ±±ÈÅéËá∫ÁÅ£), a folk song about how early Chinese settlers had first crossed the Taiwan Strait by boat. He employed more traditional Taiwanese sounds such as the pentatonic scale. In a later interview he noted that he felt that he could only express his deepest feelings through Taiwanese, not Mandarin.  Work with Hou Hsiao-hsien  After establishing his musical studio, a friend of his gave one of his cassette recordings to Hou Hsiao-hsien. After half a year, Hou's assistant gave him a call and asked if he write the musical score for Dust in the Wind, which would go on to win a best music award at the Three Continents Festival. Hou would also ask Chen to write the score for The Puppetmaster in 1993, for which he won the award for best score at the Film Fest Gent in Belgium. According to Chen, it was this prize that gave him some assurance that he could make a living writing music.  Blacklist Studio: Protest songs in Taiwanese  In 1987, martial law was lifted in Taiwan after nearly 40 years, and Taiwan entered a new era. At the time, Chen Ming-chang was working as a manufacturing assistant at Four Seas Records (ÂõõÊµ∑Âî±Áâá) along with Wang Ming- hui (ÁéãÊòéËºù), Chen Chu-hui (Èô≥‰∏ªÊÉ†) and Lin Wei-je (ÊûóÁÖíÂì≤), where they talked about working on something themselves. According to Chen: They formed the group Blacklist Studio and in 1989 released alternative Taiwanese rock album \\"Songs of Madness\\" (ÊäìÁãÇÊ≠å) with Rock Records. Each song reflected a social reality of the time: \\"Taxi\\" (Ë®àÁ®ãËªä) and \\"Dad's Words\\" (ÈòøÁà∏ÁöÑË©±) were about everyday life for the people, and the song \\"A-Tsao Democracy\\" (Ê∞ë‰∏ªÈòøËçâ) was a political satire about the \\"Thousand Year National Assembly\\" (referring to the fact that the most of the seats in the National Assembly, representing various provinces in China, were essentially made to be permanent members). Beyond reflecting the social situation of the time, the band opened new possibilities for Taiwanese language music by experimenting with styles such as rap, folk, and rock, as opposed to the sentimental ballads which had typified Taiwanese music in the past. The album was released close to election season, and the Kuomintang prohibited its broadcast. Though it was praised by critics, it was not a commercial success. Later, Chen Ming-chang would say: \\"We were prepared to be arrested or taken away but we still wanted to see whether the lifting of martial law was real or not.\\" = Rise in popularity (1990-present) = In 1990, Chen Ming-chang's music began to grow in popularity. He released two albums that year: Live Works 1 (ÁèæÂ†¥‰ΩúÂìÅ(1)) and An Afternoon Drama (‰∏ãÂçàÁöÑ‰∏ÄÈΩ£Êà≤), and Live Works 2 in the following year. These works were all critically acclaimed in the music industry. In 1992, after an island-wide tour of college campuses, Chen took a break from his solo career to write music for The Puppetmaster and other films. He felt that his music had become tired, and that it was easier to write film scores since the ideas were already in place. In 1993, he wrote songs for events hosted by the Garden of Hope Foundation to rescue child prostitutes. His experiences at these events led him to write the popular song \\"She is Our Darling\\", which became the anthem for the 228 Hand-In-Hand Rally in 2004, and was also played at the end of the 326 March To Protect Taiwan (‰∏â‰∫åÂÖ≠Ë≠∑Âè∞ÁÅ£Â§ßÈÅäË°å) in response to the passage of the Anti-Secession Law in China. That year, he also suffered a spinal injury, which Chen has attributed to his alcohol use. He had long seen alcohol as a source of creative inspiration, drinking late into the night while working and not rising until the afternoon. In 1993 he suffered a spinal injury and quit drinking while in the hospital, but suffered from anxiety and panic attacks afterwards which made it difficult for him to think. During this time he would go to the mountain temples in Beitou every day to listen to Buddhist scripture readings.  \\"Wandering to Tamsui\\" and the Danshui Wandering Minstrels  Because of his illness, Chen Ming-chang stopped writing music for two years until 1995, when he wrote popular and award-winning \\"Wandering to Tamsui\\" (ÊµÅÊµ™Âà∞Ê∑°Ê∞¥), which was inspired by the lifestyles of wandering minstrels Chin Man-wang (ÈáëÈñÄÁéã) and Lee Ping-huei (ÊùéÁÇ≥Ëºù). He founded a musical group called the Danshui Wandering Minstrels in 1997. The members of the band all had day jobs: the guitarist A-Chang (ÈòøÊòå) was a judicial scrivener, bassist Steve (Âè≤Â∏ùÂ§´) was an American lawyer, the drummer Little Huang (Â∞èÈªÉ) was a manager at a medicine factory, Huai-yi (Êá∑‰∏Ä) worked in advertising, and Chen Ming-chang was growing orchids. Only their manager A-liang (Èòø‰∫Æ) worked for the group full-time. They agreed that to not give up their day jobs so that playing music would remain a fun hobby for them. The group practiced on Saturdays and performed all across Taiwan. = Recent career (2000-present) = In 2009, Chen founded the Taiwanese Yueqin Folksong Association (Âè∞ÁÅ£ÊúàÁê¥Ê∞ëË¨†ÂçîÊúÉ), which has hosted an annual four-week yueqin folk song festival at the Beitou Hot Springs Museum during the Mid-Autumn Festival since 2011. The group promotes broader interest for the Taiwanese yueqin via outreach to schools, community colleges and community centers. The organization also conducts exchanges with Japanese shamisen players. In 2010, he composed and produced Huang Fei's hit single \\"Chase Chase Chase\\" (ËøΩËøΩËøΩ). He wrote the score for the Zero Chou film Ripples of Desire in 2012, which prominently features the Taiwanese yueqin. On July 27, 2019, Chen Ming-chang released a single titled \\"Hong Kong! Freedom\\" (È¶ôÊ∏ØÔºÅËá™Áî±) on YouTube in support of the anti-extradition bill protests in Hong Kong. The song had two versions, one in Taiwanese and the other in Cantonese. He also participated in a free public concert in Liberty Square that November in support of the Hong Kong protests.  Influences and associated acts  Chen Ming-chang's music was deeply influenced by that of Chen Da, a Taiwanese folk singer from Hengchun. In particular, it was Chen Da's music that caused Chen Ming-chang to decide to primary sing in Taiwanese Hokkien, his mother tongue. In the liner notes to his album An Afternoon Play, he recalls a time when he saw Chen Da perform in a Western-style restaurant in Taipei, and noted the contrast between the musician's loose-fitting suit and the lifestyles of the steak-eating audience members. He has also cited influences from various traditional operas, such as Taiwanese opera, which his father would often take him to see as a child. He has been cited for inventing a style of guitar playing that mimicked the sounds of the beiguan, nanguan and Taiwanese yueqin. Chen has also cited aboriginal influences in his music from when he spent time in aboriginal villages in Taitung and Hualien. His music was also influence from seeing Nakasi performers in neighboring Beitou hotels starting at an early age, as well as the open air theater performances his grandfather would take him to see. Performances of traditional operas and plays happened almost every day in his neighborhood, including beiguan, nanguan, Taiwanese opera, and glove puppetry, and as a result he was steeped in traditional Taiwanese culture ever since his youth. His mother would also sing old Taiwanese songs growing up, passing the stylistic tradition to him orally. His father also often took him to glove puppetry shows, where the action, puppets and songs left a deep impression on a young Ming-chang. In the past, he would borrow musicians from Wu Bai's band China Blue. Since the early 2000s, he has also been known for collaborating with, as well as producing and composing songs for singer Huang Fei.  Awards  * In 1987, Dust in the Wind became the first Taiwanese film to win an international prize for film score at the Three Continents Festival in Nantes, France. * In 1993, Chen won the prize for best score for The Puppetmaster (film) at the Film Fest Gent in Belgium. * In 1995, he would write the score for the Hirokazu Koreeda film Maborosi, which won the Best Music Award at the 1995 Mainichi Film Awards in Japan. * In 1998, he won the Best Composer award at the 9th Golden Melody Awards in 1998 for the song \\"Wandering to Tamsui\\".

Katz (born 1954) is a Canadian psychologist and researcher. He is a Distinguished Research Professor and Canada Research Chair in Health Psychology at York University. He also serves as the research director of the pain research unit in the Department of Anesthesia and pain management at the Toronto General Hospital in addition to serving as a professor in the Department of Anesthesia at the University of Toronto. Early life and education Katz earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from McGill University in Montreal before enrolling in Dalhousie University for his Master's degree. While at Dalhousie, he studied speech perception in infants before accepting a position at the Montreal General Hospital's Pain Center as a research assistant. While working at the Montreal General Hospital Pain Centre with the late Dr. Ronald Melzack, Katz interacted with amputees experiencing phantom pains, which he dubbed \\"somatosensory pain memories.\\" This sparked his interest in pain research. He and Melzack also evaluated the efficacy of auriculotherapy in reducing phantom limb pain. He spent two years at the hospital before re-enrolling in at McGill for his doctorate under Dr. Melzack's supervision. Career In 1990, Katz moved to Toronto where he conducted his postdoctoral work in the Departments of Psychology and Anesthesia & Pain Management at the Toronto General Hospital. While there, he co-authored a review of clinical and experimental evidence towards pain titled Contribution of central neuroplasticity to pathological pain: review of clinical and experimental evidence. He also embarked on several studies with the late Brian P. Kavanagh and other colleagues testing a hypothesis that derived from his doctoral research that when it works, pre-emptive analgesia reduces acute pain after surgery because it blocks the formation of a somatosensory memory-like mechanism in the spinal cord. Katz joined the faculty in the Department of Psychology as a professor and Canada Research Chair in Health Psychology at York University in 2002. He co-conducted studies in pain management and control post-surgery with colleagues at the University Health Network in Toronto. Their research discovered that those who received preemptive or preventive pain control showed a reduction in pain disability within three weeks after surgery. Katz found that while regional anesthesia was successful in reducing the intensity of acute pain, there was not enough conclusive research to show that it preempted chronic pain. Katz later received the University of Toronto's Department of Anesthesia 2007 Faculty Research Award and York's 2011 Faculty Teaching Award. In 2013, Katz co- authored a study with Gabrielle Pag√© which found that children who experienced extreme and unpleasant pain post-surgery were more likely to develop moderate to severe pain within six months. Katz also led a study which used an eye- tracker device to test reaction times when people with chronic pain looked at pain-related and neutral words. In 2014, Katz and Dr. Hance Clarke, Director of Pain Services at the Toronto General Hospital, co-founded the Transitional Pain Service, the world's first service designed to prevent and manage chronic postsurgical pain. The service functioned by intervening early during three stages of the surgical trajectory and diagnosing patients at high risk for developing chronic pain. As a result, he received the [anadian Pain Society's 2013 Distinguished Career Award for \\"his outstanding achievements and contributions to pain research and pain management\\" and their 2016 Outstanding Pain Mentorship Award. That same year, Katz was renewed as a Canada Research Chair in Health Psychology and was appointed editor-in-chief of the Canadian Journal of Pain. On March 9, 2016, Katz was the recipient of the Canadian Psychological Association's Donald O. Hebb Award for Distinguished Contributions to Psychology as a Science. At the conclusion of the 2016‚Äì17 academic year, Katz and Jonathan Edmondson were appointed Distinguished Research Professorship for their \\"outstanding contributions to the University through research\\". On September 26, 2017, Katz was named a fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences alongside Paul McDonald, Dean of the Faculty of Health at York University. In 2018, Katz, Jane Heffernan, and Paul Ritvo worked alongside app developer ManagingLife to be the first researchers to define pain volatility through prediction models. Their analysis was published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and found that pain management apps such as \\"Manage My Pain\\" could help shape future treatments of pain. On April 16, 2019, Katz was appointed a Fellow of the American Psychological Association's Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology. A few months later, he was recognized by the Expertscape, an online database that ranks individuals and institutions by their expertise, as a \\"World Expert in postoperative pain research.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Living people Category:1954 births Category:McGill University alumni Category:Dalhousie University alumni Category:York University faculty Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Medical journal editors Category:Fellows of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences Category:Fellows of the American Psychological Association Category:Canada Research Chairs ","title":"Joel D.

The line operates every 8-20 minutes during the weekday peak hours, 30-35 minutes during the off-peak hours, and 45-60 minutes during the late nights. Route D6 trips are roughly 65-90 minutes long. Background Route D6 operates daily between Stadium‚ÄìArmory station and Sibley Hospital connecting Palisades, Foxhall, Burleith, Georgetown, and Kingman Park residents to Downtown without having to take the train. Route D6 operates out of Bladensburg division during the off- peak hours and out of Shepherd Parkway, Southern Avenue, and Western divisions during the weekday peak-hours. History The Sibley Hospital Line was originally operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company prior to it merging with the Capital Traction Company in 1933. Route D6 originally began operating between Glover Park and Downtown under the Capital Street Company. The line at first were operated by streetcars, but then formed into buses on April 12, 1926. The line was later operated until DC Transit in 1956 and then acquired by WMATA on February 4, 1973. Service along Loughboro Road was replaced by route M4 and F Street/D Street was replaced by route 42 through the years. =1976 changes= On March 27, 1976, route D6 was extended from Downtown DC to Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station via Washington Union Station in order to provide newly opened Metrorail service. =1977 changes= On June 15, 1977, route D6 was extended from Rhode Island Avenue to Washington Hospital Center. A new route D8 was also introduced to operate between Washington Hospital Center and Sibley Hospital via the Hospital Complex, Trinity University, Glenwood Cemetery, the Edgewood Terrace Apartments, the Rhode Island Avenue Shopping Center, the Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station, Washington Union Station, Judiciary Square, Metro Center, and Dupont Circle stations. =1995 changes= In 1995, the line was split into two routes in order to simplify the line. Route D6 was split to operate between Sibley Hospital and Stadium‚ÄìArmory station, via Washington Union Station, instead of operating to Washington Hospital Center and up to Glover Park in order to replace the segment of the former routes 40, 42, and 44 between Union Station and Stadium‚ÄìArmory station when both 40 and 44 were discontinued and 42 was shortened to operate between Mount Pleasant and Metro Center station. Route D6 also replaced the potion of route D2 between Dupont Circle station and Stadium‚ÄìArmory station and route D4 portion between Washington Union Station and Stadium‚ÄìArmory station. New routes D1 and D3 were introduced to operate alongside the D6. D1 would operate between Glover Park and Washington Union Station while route D3 operated between Sibley Hospital and Union Station. Route D8 was also split to only operate between Washington Hospital Center and Washington Union Station. The segment of D8's routing west of Union Station was replaced by routes D1, D3, and D6. At the same time, the D8 replaced the segment of D6's former routing between Union Station and Washington Hospital Center, via Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station. As a result, as route D6 became a part of the Sibley Hospital‚ÄìStadium Armory Line, which operated alongside routes D1 and D3 while route D8 became a part of the Hospital Center Line. =2009 changes= On December 27, 2009, short trips were added to route D6 during the weekday peak hours. According to WMATA it goes as follows: The weekday schedule will change. Buses servicing the route between Sibley Hospital and Stadium-Armory Metrorail station will be scheduled every 22 to 25 minutes with shorter route buses servicing in between during the afternoon peak period. Eastbound short trip buses to Stadium Armory will leave Farragut Square (on 17th Street) at 3:14, 3:39, 4:02, 4:25, 4:45, 5:09, 5:32, 5:54, and 6:13 p.m. Westbound short trips to Sibley Hospital will leave Farragut Square at 4:47, 5:11, 5:37, 5:59, 6:23, and 6:47 p.m. It means is that there will continue to be buses operating the full route every 22 to 25 minutes with two shorter routes added during peak hours. One will go from Farragut Square to Stadium‚ÄìArmory station and the other will go from Farragut Square to Sibley Hospital. =2012 changes= On June 17, 2012, route D6 short trips to Dupont Circle will end at 20th Street & New Hampshire Avenue, NW instead of at P & 22nd streets, NW. Short trips starting at Farragut Square will leave from 17th & I streets, NW on the east side of the park rather than from the west side of the park.

The poets, writers such as - Devulapalli Krishna Sastri, Srirangam Srinivasa Rao (Sri Sri), Balantrapu Rajanikanta Rao, and linguists like Professor Bhadriraju Krishnamurthi regarded Abburi Ramakrishna Rao as their mentor and were addressing him as the master. They were having several literary discussions. Abburi suggested to the editor Nageshwara Rao Pantulu in his \\"Andhra Patrika\\" Magazine to introduce a new feature - \\"Sarasvatanubandham\\" in 1917‚Äì18. The feature was initiated with his article \\"Abhinava Kavita Prasamsa\\". Then in 1924‚Äì25, he made them initiating another new supplement \\"Rasamanjari\\" in that magazine.Masoona.

When Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was the Vice-Chancellor, Dr.M.O.Thomas was appointed as Librarian and Abubri was sent to Telugu department of university as the first faculty. He also taught the Sanskrit language there. Abburi Ramakrishna Rao was later appointed as a university librarian and worked there for about 30 years.Yajnanna Sastri,Somanchi.Abburi Ramakrishna Rao garu-nenu.Abburi Samsmarana.Editor: Abburi Gopalakrishna.Hyderabad, Natyagoshti,1988.p.4-11. When he was appointed as a librarian he did not qualify for a professional librarian position. He was awarded the honorary degree \\"Fellow of Library Association, London\\" (FLA) from the British Library Association, London. Abburi as a librarian and a scholar of the literary, cultural sphere, many poets and scholars were consulting him. It contributed to the rise of the literary atmosphere in the Visakhapatnam area. Recognizing the need for trained staff at different levels to ensure that proper functioning of libraries, Abburi introduced Library Science Course in Andhra University at Diploma level. His close association with Andhra University Vice-Chancellors, especially with Dr.V.S. Krishna helped him to develop the university library and library studies in the university. Abburi Ramakrishna Rao retired in 1960, 2/3 years later completing his term. Regarding libraries, he said that \\"libraries are not orphanages....they should not develop like orphanagesNarayanarao,D.J.Smritipadhamlo Sree Abburi.Grandhalaya Jyoti.p.7-11.April‚ÄìJune 1980.When Kurnool was the capital of Andhra Pradesh, Abburi was actively involved in the State Library Committee's activities, discussed the issues of the public library movement, contributing to the district librarians. Most of these librarians were his students.

The Andhra University, recognising the key role played by him for Telugu Literary Service, the development of the Andhra University University Library and Public Libraries conferred honorary doctorate with the title of \\"Kalaprapurna\\" to Abburi on 1974 August 3, in their 47th Convocation. He accepted only this award.Madhavacharyulu,Y.Prakhyapana prasangam.Abburi Samsmarana.Editor: Abburi Gopalakrishna.Hyderabad, Natyagoshti,1988.p.43-45. After the formation of the Andhra Pradesh State in 1953, the State Government sought the advice and cooperation of Abburi in establishing the State Central Library in 1956 to widen the linkage of libraries in the newly created State of Vishalandra. As a president of the \\"Vishakha Writers' Association\\", he started editing \\"Nannayya Pada Suchi\\". He was affiliated with Kendra Sahitya Akademi and Kendra Sangeet Natak Academy. After the formation of \\"Sahitya Akademi\\", he planned for editing \\"Tikkanna\\" and other reference tools and the \\"Catalogue of 20th century Telugu Literary Publications\\".He translated Rabindranath Tagore's plays into Telugu in 1957‚Äì58 at the request of the Sahitya Academy.

Kroll (born 1965) is an American police officer and member of the Minneapolis Police Department. He is the president of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis, the police union for the police department. Over the course of his career, Kroll has been involved in three officer shootings, accumulated 20 internal affairs complaints, and been the subject of multiple lawsuits. Kroll has been a longtime opponent to reforms of the police department, including calls to address racial bias within the force and reduce the number of people killed by police. Kroll has generated controversy on a number of occasions due to his public statements and professional conduct. In particular, his comments following the killing of George Floyd in May 2020 resulted in major calls for this resignation, including from a number of unions, several former mayors of Minneapolis, and a former police chief. CareerPolice force and union leadership= Kroll joined the Minneapolis Police Department in 1989. He was on the department's SWAT team for 15 years, and served in the vice unit, public housing unit, and as head of the domestic violence unit. He was promoted to sergeant in 1994, elected to the board of the Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis in 1996 and named vice president in 2006. He won his first two-year term as president of the union in May 2015. As head of the federation and its approximately 800 members, Kroll advocates for additional police officers and additional autonomy of the police. Over his career, Kroll has been involved in three officer shootings. By 2015, Kroll had accumulated 20 internal affairs complaints, only three of which were disciplined, including one that led to his demotion. =Actions and controversies= 1990s  In 1994, Kroll received a five-day suspension for excessive use of force that was later overturned. A 1995 lawsuit against Kroll in federal court alleged that he had used racial slurs while beating, choking and kicking a 15-year-old multi- racial boy and was cleared of all charges. Kroll oversaw a botched Emergency Response Unit drug raid in 1996 where an officer was shot by friendly fire.  2000s  During a no-knock raid on an elderly couple's residence in September 2002, Kroll was among several officers accused of using excessive force. A lawsuit regarding the incident was settled for $60,000. In March 2003 Kroll was involuntarily demoted for ethical violations. He had his rank reinstated three months later. A City of Minneapolis attorney recommended settling a lawsuit for $15,000 stemming from Kroll kicking and beating a suspect at an impound lot in February 2004. While off-duty in May 2004, Kroll and another officer assaulted several people at an art crawl in northeast Minneapolis. After a man allegedly bumped up against their vehicle, Kroll and the other officer, dressed in plain clothes, punched him, throwing him on the sidewalk and hitting his head on the ground. They taunted bystanders and then punched the man's sister and kicked another person in the face. A complaint about the incident was sustained by the Civilian Review Authority and Kroll was suspended for 20 days. One month later, during a departmental ethics class, Kroll allegedly said that then-Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim, was a terrorist. He also used a homophobic slur against a gay staffer to mayor R. T. Rybak, resulting in his suspension. In 2007, Kroll was named multiple times in a racial discrimination lawsuit brought against the city of Minneapolis by five black officers, including current police chief Medaria Arradondo. The lawsuit described Kroll as having \\"a history of discriminatory attitudes and conduct,\\" saying that he wore a motorcycle jacket that allegedly had a white power patch but no pictures can be found. The lawsuit also alleged that Kroll was racially discriminatory in overtime assignments following the I-35W bridge collapse.  2010s  Black Lives Matter protest outside the Minneapolis police federation building on December 3, 2015 After the shooting of Jamar Clark in 2015, Kroll contradicted witness statements that Clark was handcuffed at the moment of the shooting, saying he was actively resisting arrest and tried to take the weapon of one of the officers. It was later concluded that there was no evidence that Jamar Clark was handcuffed by U.S. Attorney Andrew Luger. He referred to the Black Lives Matter movement as a \\"terrorist organization.\\" Kroll was also critical of the responses of then-mayor Betsy Hodges and police chief Jane√© Harteau, who said that Kroll's views were \\"not consistent with 21st-century policing.\\" In 2016, after officers walked off a job at a Minnesota Lynx game over jerseys that said \\"Black Lives Matter,\\" Kroll said that he commended the four officers, saying that Lynx games had \\"such a pathetic draw.\\" In July 2016, an email from police chief Harteau to Kroll was leaked to the press in which Harteau ordered Kroll to wear his police uniform only for department-sanctioned purposes, which does not include his capacity as a union representative. During the grand jury investigation of the shooting of Justine Damond in 2018, Kroll challenged Hennepin County Attorney Michael O. Freeman's efforts to gather testimony from officers. Later that year, Kroll pushed back against requirements that police department squad cars have placards informing immigrants of their rights. In 2019, following a ban on \\"warrior-style\\" training for police officers by mayor Jacob Frey, Kroll called the directive unlawful and announced that the union would offer free warrior-style training for officers as long as Frey remains in office.  2020s  A protester holds a sign at the Minneapolis police federation on June 12, 2020 Following the death of George Floyd in May 2020, Kroll characterized Floyd as a \\"violent criminal\\" and called the protests a \\"terrorist movement\\" in a letter to fellow police union members. Kroll came under intense criticism in the wake of his comments. Minnesota AFL-CIO President Bill McCarthy criticized Kroll in June 2020 for \\"a long history of bigoted remarks and complaints of violence made against him\\" toward black residents. McCarthy, Education Minnesota (the state's teachers union), and former Minneapolis Chief of Police Jane√© Harteau called for Kroll's resignation. Harteau said Kroll's behavior during the George Floyd protests was a \\"disgrace to the badge.\\" Former Minneapolis mayor R. T. Rybak called Kroll \\"overtly racist\\" and \\"a cancer on this police department, on this city.\\" Kroll has received widespread public attention in protests over George Floyd's death. Demonstrators called for his resignation at a rally outside the Minneapolis federation on July 12, 2020. Minneapolis civil rights activist Nekima Levy Armstrong said in a speech, \\"Bob Kroll is as racist as they come! And his evil has been allowed to fester inside the Minneapolis Police Department!\\" A number of protests have focused specifically on having Kroll removed from his positions, among other calls for police reform and police abolition. In a letter published May 27, 2020, the Metropolitan Urban Indian Directors Group, a coalition of 30 American Indian organizations, called for Kroll's termination. The Minnesota Nurses Association also called for his resignation on the same day. Minnesota House of Representatives speaker Melissa Hortman and Minneapolis City Council member Steve Fletcher have also called on Kroll to resign. A 100-person protest group led by Levy Armstrong's Racial Justice Network gathered outside Kroll's home in Hugo, Minnesota on August 15, 2020, to call for his resignation from the Minneapolis police union. Protesters also criticized Kroll's partner, WCCO television reporter Liz Collins, for having a conflict of interest in stories about police violence. Remarks by John Thompson, a Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor candidate for the state legislature from St. Paul, drew controversy. Thompson said in his speech, \\"You think we give a [expletive] about burning Hugo down?\\" and also \\"[Expletive] Hugo.\\" Some of Thompson's remarks were said to be directed at children who were present. The event also featured the bashing of pi√±ata effigies of Kroll and Collins. Several local media members condemned the symbolic display of violence against a woman journalist. Inflammatory rhetoric at the event was also condemned by leaders of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor and Republican parties, and led to an apology statement from the Thompson.Uren, Adam (18 August 2020). \\"Protesters condemned after they destroy pi√±ata of WCCO's Liz Collin\\". Bring Me the News.Staff (17 August 2020). \\"GNo felony charges to be filed against House DFL candidate who spoke at Hugo protest\\". Star Tribune. Retrieved on 19 August 2020. Political views Kroll supports and endorses President Donald Trump. He spoke at an October 2019 Trump rally in Minneapolis and featured in a 2020 Trump campaign ad. Kroll sold \\"Cops for Trump\\" shirts, actions that generated concerns about political bias of the police force. According to Minneapolis deputy chief Art Knight, Kroll subscribes to the \\"broken windows\\" theory of policing. Personal life Kroll grew up on the East Side of Saint Paul, Minnesota. His father was in a union. During a bar fight when he was off-duty, Kroll had part of his ear bitten off. Kroll is married to Liz Collin, a news anchor for ViacomCBS‚Äìowned CBS station WCCO-TV. This relationship is widely considered a conflict of interest, as Collin has routinely covered police matters for WCCO since 2013. In June 2020, protests were held outside WCOO's downtown offices, calling on Collin to resign from her post; WCCO responded that Collin has not reported on police issues for at least two and a half years in response to public pressure over the relationship.

The tracks are large and three-toed, and based on their size are believed to have been made by tyrannosaurids, such as Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. Fossils of Bellatoripes are notable for preserving trackways of multiple individual tyrannosaurids all travelling in the same direction at similar speeds, suggesting the prints may have been made by a group, or pack, of tyrannosaurids moving together. Such inferences of behaviour cannot be made with fossil bones alone, so the record of Bellatoripes tracks together is important for understanding how large predatory theropods such as tyrannosaurids may have lived. Discovery and classification Excavation of the Bellatoripes track site in situ Bellatoripes was named in 2014 from a tracksite discovered in the Wapiti Formation, British Columbia containing the trackways of three separate track- makers, but isolated individual prints were already known prior to this discovery, including one from the Wapiti Formation and another from Dinosaur Provincial Park in Alberta. The trackway was first discovered by a local guide-outfitter Aaron Fredlund from two footprints in October 2011, and the rest of the track site was fully excavated by August 2012. Three distinct trackways were identified, Trackway A consisting of three footprints (the holotype specimen), Trackway B of just one, and Trackway C with two prints. The track types were assigned to a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, Bellatoripes fredlundi, named after Fredlund for his discovery. The closest comparable ichnogenus to Bellatoripes in shape is Tyrannosauripus, a single track from the younger late Maastrichtian of New Mexico attributed to Tyrannosaurus. Bellatoripes is distinguished from Tyrannosauripus by its smaller size, lack of separate soft-tissue pad impressions along its digits, and hallux impressions that face forward (compared to the inward-facing hallux impression of Tyrannosauripus). Nonetheless, the close similarity in soft- tissue traits between the two ichnogenera prompted McCrea and colleagues to coin the ichnofamily Tyrannosauripodidae, to which they also referred similar, unnamed prints from the Nemegt Formation in Mongolia. The ichnofamily was named for the presumed track-makers of these prints, theropods from the family Tyrannosauridae. Bellatoripes and other tyrannosauripodids share a number of unique features that distinguish them from other known large theropod footprints, including a large heel pad and thick digits that lack distinct toe pads and taper in width towards the claws. Bellatoripes and other tyrannosauripodid tracks cannot be definitively assigned to Tyrannosauridae based on shared morphological traits alone, but the absence of other large theropods from the same geographical areas and stratigraphic ages precludes any other identities for the trackmakers. It is possible then that the soft- tissue features of Bellatoripes and tyrannosauripodid tracks are synapomorphies of Tyrannosauridae as a whole. Description Photogrammetry of the Bellatoripes holotype trackway Bellatoripes tracks are large, tridactyl, and bipedal pes prints, with the middle (third) toe being the longest (mesaxonic) and all toes bearing sharp, pointed claw impressions, typical of theropod footprints. The prints indicate the feet were robust and encased in thick soft tissues, including broad heel pads and thick digits that gradually taper out in thickness along their length. Bellatoripes footprints are over in length, and trackways record pace lengths of nearly and strides of almost , leading to an estimated hip height for the track-maker at . A clawed hallux is preserved on some of the prints, but its identification has been disputed and these impressions have alternatively suggested to be from the base of the second toe. Skin impressions of Bellatoripes preserve small, tuberculate scales, typical of theropod feet. Palaeobiology The presence of three, parallel Bellatoripes trackways inferred to have been created in a short span of time is suggested to indicate that tyrannosaurids were social, gregarious animals that travelled in groups. Similar suggestions could only be made from skeletal evidence from body fossils alone, such as assemblages of multiple individuals preserved together at one locality. The sedimentary conditions to preserve the tracks implies that they were made within a short span of time, and other tracks at the same site (including those of a hadrosaur and a smaller theropod) are more randomly oriented, implying that the animals were not constrained along the same path by a geographical barrier. Bellatoripes tracks are the first evidence from traces of living tyrannosaurids to support the suggestion that they lived in groups. The hypothesised movements of the Bellatoripes track-maker The trackways of Bellatoripes allowed for the speed the track-maker was travelling at to be calculated, using the estimated hip height and stride lengths. This speed was calculated to be around to , and is inferred to represent the preferred walking gait of tyrannosaurid theropods. Similarly, the age of the track- makers could be inferred from the dimensions of the footprints compared to the estimated hip height based upon contemporary tyrannosaurids that likely produced Bellatoripes tracks (Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus, and Daspletosaurus). The track-makers were estimated to be between 25‚Äì29 years old, within the known upper age range of tyrannosaurid lifespans and indicating that the animals were mature adults. The fine preservation of the distal digits and small, parallel striations (interpreted as drag marks) within Bellatoripes tracks suggests that the track-makers partially withdrew their feet backwards before stepping forward, leaving the overlying sediment undisturbed. This contrasts with what is typically seen in other theropod footprints, where the tips of the digits drag as they are pulled forward, but is similar to the observed movements of ostrich feet during locomotion. =Palaeopathology= In the Wapiti Trackway A, the second digit of the left foot appears consistently truncated in both footprints #1 and #3, suggesting that the foot of the track- maker was injured in some way. The truncation suggests either the amputation of the claw and associated toe bone (phalanx) or a deformation or dislocation that kept the outer toe from contacting the ground, although the rough and uneven margin of the 'nub' at the tip of the impression suggests that the former is more likely from the loss of tissue and bone. Despite this, the dimensions of the trackway indicate that the injury did not negatively impact the animal's locomotion, with only a slight outward rotation of the right foot to compensate. The animal was otherwise moving at a similar speed and gait to the those that produced the other trackways. Alternatively, Weems (2019) proposed that the truncation of digit II in trackway A was not an injury, but due to the trackmaker shifting its weight leftwards in response to its right foot sinking more deeply into the substrate, leaving an imperfect and poorly depressed digit II impression.

In 2019, Emami was elected a Fellow of the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences and Acad√©mie dentaire du Qu√©bec. Early life and education Emami was born and raised in Iran. After graduating from high school, she moved to Canada in 2002 to pursue her MSc in prosthodontic rehabilitation followed by her PhD in biomedical science at the Universit√© de Montr√©al and McGill University (joint program). She also completed a post- doctoral fellowship in dental public health at McGill University and in Cancer Epidemiology at Universit√© de Montr√©al. Career In 2009, Emami was a visiting professor at the University of McGill's Division of Oral Health & Society under supervisor Christophe Bedos. During this time, she co-authored with Jocelyne Feine a study titled Impact of implant support for mandibular dentures on satisfaction, oral and general health‚Äêrelated quality of life: a meta‚Äêanalysis of randomized‚Äêcontrolled trials. She eventually joined the faculty at McGill University Faculty of Dentistry in 2011 as an Adjunct Professor. The following year, she co-led a study with Igor Karp to study the link between oral health and colorectal cancer. They found that people with little to no teeth were more at risk to colorectal cancer.

History  The preserve was created at the combination of three former estates. The Muttontown Nature Center and Chelsea Estate is on a former 100-acre estate donated by Alexandra Moore McKay, whose family owned the Chelsea Family Farm in what is now Chelsea, Manhattan. The largest transaction was a purchase of the Lansdell Christie Estate from Lansdell Christie, a pioneer in Liberia industry. On this land was King Zog's Knollwood Estate, a 60-room mansion that he let go to ruin. Having never entered the United States, Zog sold the land to Christie, who sold it to Nassau County. The mansion was demolished by the Christie family in 1959, however some evidence of it lingers as stairs and broken fountains. The actual building does not exist any more.  Grounds  The Chelsea Mansion is a 40-room mansion that is on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1929, it perfectly exhibits the architectural design of the Long Island Gold Coast Era, with French, English, and Chinese influences. It can be rented out for private events, like weddings and corporate retreats. Also in the preserve is the Nassau Hall, yet another Gold Coast mansion built in 1903 for Bronson Winthrop. In general, the preserve is filled with miles of marked and unmarked nature trails full of trees, flowers, plants, birds, reptiles, and other animals. The county's Department of Parks, Recreation, and Museums have held guided walks in the park before. The dominant soil is an acidic well drained brown loam of the Montauk series.https://casoilresource.lawr.ucdavis.edu/gmap/  References  External links  * Muttontown Preserve Website Category:Parks in Nassau County, New York ","title":"Muttontown Preserve"},{"id":"64144611","text":"Wilfried Bohlsen (November 23, 1934 - June 15, 2016) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and former member of the German Bundestag.

The group is defined as including Eurysternum, Plesiochelys and Thalassemys to the exclusion of Pelomedusa, Testudo and Protostega. While a clade uniting the families Eurysternidae, Plesiochelyidae and Thalassemydidae had been supported by phylogenetic evidence, a name was not given for the clade until 2017, when J√©r√©my Anquetin and colleagues coined Thalassochelydia. While inner relationships of the clade are so uncertain as to make the monophyly of the families questionable, the significant diversity of thalassochelydians makes using the potentially invalid terms useful to describe the different morphologies. The monophyly of Thalassochelydia was further supported by a later analysis by Serjocha Evers and Roger Benson in 2019, where the group, represented by Solnhofia and Plesiochelyidae was sister taxon to Sandownidae within the clade Angolachelonia, which, unlike as found by Anquetin et al. earlier, was outside Cryptodira and Testudines.

He is currently working as Chief Scientist Quantum Computer Theory for Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab, a team he joined in 2013, shortly after its foundation.  Education years Boixo started his undergraduate education pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in Complutense University of Madrid,started in 1993 and which he finished in 1996. He was part of the first Complutense's promotion in such degree, being awarded with the Chip de Oro prize for his academic achievements. Meanwhile he was also studying a Bachelor's degree in Philosophy through National University of Distance Education (UNED), which he completed in 2002. He finished a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics the following year, also through UNED. During these years he also worked as a system architect for Semanticedge, as a C+ developer for the European Central Bank and as a consultant and software analyst for various private companies. It was afterwards that his career path turned more into Physics. In 2004 he was awarded with a LaCaixa fellowship to study in the University of New Mexico. He studied a Master's degree in Physics in the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 2008 and he published some of his first research focusing on quantum annealing. That same year he got a Ph. D. in Physics through the University of New Mexico advised by Carlton M. Caves for his thesis on nonlinear quantum metrology. Part of the theory developed on this thesis was later implemented in an optical experiment.  Work  After finishing his Ph.D, he moved to California to work for the California Institute of Technology with John Preskill, who coined the term \\"quantum supremacy\\" that the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab in which Boixo works would later demonstrate. In Caltech he did research on quantum information and quantum computing, topics that he kept working on afterwards in Harvard, where he also studied quantum simulators and computational quantum chemistry. In 2011 he moved to the University of Southern California, where he focused his efforts in quantum computing and got to work with the first commercial quantum processor ever. He joined Google's quantum computing team in 2013. This team has focused on topics such as quantum simulation, quantum neural networks and quantum metrology. In 2019 they published a paper showing they had achieved quantum supremacy, completing with a quantum computer in just three minutes a task that would take 10000 years to be done by the world's most powerful classical supercomputer.

Unrest in the city began as a response to the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, and numerous protests, rallies and marches have taken place in Chicago ever since. The demonstrations, supporting justice for Floyd and protesting police brutality, are occurring simultaneously with those of over 100 other cities in the United States. Chicago is among 12 major cities that declared curfews in order to prevent looting and vandalism. On May 31, Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker to send the Illinois National Guard to Chicago for the first time in 52 years since the 1968 riots in Chicago. The economic damage caused by the disturbances to date exceed $125 million.2 Months After Looting And Unrest, Many Chicago Businesses Still Need Help Rebuilding Retrieved August 23, 2020 Black Lives Matter holds rally in Chicago to support those arrested after looting, unrest Retrieved August 23, 2020 EventsMay 28= On May 28, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot compared Floyd's death to the murder of Laquan McDonald, saying \\"there but for the grace of God goes Chicago.\\" Chicago Police Department Superintendent David Brown required officers to watch the video of Floyd's death and undergo training on positional asphyxiation. =May 29= Protesters gathered on May 29 in Millennium Park and marched through the Loop chanting Floyd's name. Demonstrators shut down several downtown streets and blocked traffic on the Eisenhower Expressway. Near the intersection of State and Harrison streets, several protesters were seen throwing bottles and climbing onto cars. One individual was arrested while carrying a gun. A small group of protesters demonstrated in front of Trump Tower near midnight. The protesters eventually broke up once they reached the Near North Side neighborhood, and protests eventually died down by the early-morning hours. =May 30= Amateur video of protesters and police at Trump Tower (Chicago) 4:00p.m. on May 30, 2020 During protests on May 30, one person died and six were shot. The Chicago Police reported multiple arrests and damaged property. About a dozen officers were injured, including one who suffered a broken wrist. Around 108 arrests were confirmed on the night of May 29‚Äì30, and Mayor Lightfoot called on protesters to remain peaceful, stating that \\"it's not easy when we have a president who is inciting violence. Let's be better than him.\\" Around 4:30 am CDT, a board-up company was covering the windows of the State Street Old Navy location, and the Champs store near the intersection of State and Madison streets had several damaged windows. Multiple marches were expected throughout the weekend. Another demonstration was planned for 2:00p.m. on Saturday the 30th, and Mayor Lightfoot stated that \\"we're not going to tolerate\\" lawlessness. A large downtown parking ban was enacted, with vehicles unable to park anywhere from Chicago Avenue in the north to Congress Parkway in the south, and from Lake Shore Drive in the east to Wells Street in the west, roughly correlating to the downtown area plus the Magnificent Mile and River North neighborhoods. A crowd, which swelled to around 3,000, initiated a demonstration at Daley Plaza around 2p.m. on Saturday the 30th. Protesters carried signs and wore face masks saying \\"I Can't Breathe.\\" By 3:30p.m., hundreds were marching north, with some protesters reportedly throwing fireworks and bottles near officers. Some also tagged buildings, cars, and a bus shelter. Another group of protesters climbed on top of a 151 Sheridan CTA bus. Demonstrators gathered on three sides of a police vehicle that was backing up on Dearborn Street, and confrontations broke out between officers and protesters when a police car tried to drive down Monroe Street in the Loop. By 4p.m., the crowd had split into several groups heading in different directions, including Trump Tower, where it became markedly chaotic, with some throwing bottles and fireworks at officers. Authorities pushed protesters out of the way of a police vehicle. Along State Street, marchers heading northbound chanted \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and \\"I Can't Breathe,\\" most of them wearing masks and many holding signs that read \\"Defund the Police\\" and \\"Justice for Floyd.\\" On the Magnificent Mile, a demonstrator wore a mobile stereo around his neck as the song \\"Fight the Power\\" by Public Enemy played from it. Simultaneously, church bells rang from the Fourth Presbyterian Church. Protesters marched on Lake Shore Drive and Michigan Avenue, and the crowd began to enter the outer drive through a northbound entrance ramp. By 5p.m., officers had responded to at least one dozen \\"10-1\\" calls, a police emergency. Some demonstrators reportedly tried to overturn a police car; others tried to hop onto another CTA bus. The Ohio and Ontario feeder ramps were closed by authorities as well as the ramps leading to Eisenhower Expressway (I-290). Additionally, the CTA temporarily suspended Red Line service between the Clark/Division and Sox-35th stations. Around 7:30 pm, at the intersection of Dearborn and Hubbard streets, a police vehicle was flipped over by demonstrators. A few minutes later, officers flipped it back again and protesters moved closer to the intersection of Kinzie and Dearborn streets. By the evening, there was at least one report of injuries to police officers, including a sergeant who had broken his arm near Trump Tower. Mayor Lightfoot held a press conference just after 8p.m., stating that the protests had \\"evolved into criminal conduct\\". Following the press conference, Lightfoot imposed a curfew on the city, lasting every night from 9p.m. to 6am, until further notice. Lightfoot stated that she had seen protesters use different blunt objects like pipes and hammers to damage property. \\"I've seen protesters hurl projectiles at our police department...bottles of water, urine and lord knows what else,\\" she said.

Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown gave a message to looters and rioters, stating that \\"We will be taking you into custody when you destroy property...That's just facts. He added that several buildings were vandalized, had broken windows, and that police utilized pepper spray and \\"arrests to prevent looting. Almost every storefront on Michigan Avenue saw some form of damage on Saturday evening, including the Loop locations of Zara, Nike, CVS, Walgreens, Neiman Marcus, and the Macy's storefront on State Street. Several shootings occurred well into the night: 2 males were shot at 9:30 pm on the 0 west block of Jackson Boulevard, and a 19-year-old man was shot an hour later on the 200 north block of Michigan Avenue. At 11 pm, another two males were shot at, this time on the 100 west block of Hubbard Street. One of them was pronounced dead at the scene, and the other suffered injuries. Shortly after 11:30 pm, the Chicago Fire Department responded to a fire at the Central Camera Company store on the 200 south block of Wabash Avenue. As a result of protests, the CTA temporarily suspended its services in the downtown area, and the northbound lanes of Lake Shore Drive at Roosevelt Road were closed. By the morning of May 31, most of the drawbridges spanning the Loop and River North remained up. The Chicago Police Department announced that 204 arrests were made on Saturday the 30th. 20 officers were confirmed to have been injured. =May 31= Warning sent to smartphones regarding a temporary suspension of CTA services on the night of May 31, 2020. The Illinois National Guard was summoned to the downtown area by Governor J.B. Pritzker, who said he had done so following a request from Mayor Lightfoot on early Sunday morning. \\"I want to be clear and emphasize: the Guard is here to support our Police Department,\\" Lightfoot stated. \\"They will not be actively involved in policing and patrolling.\\" The decision is considered the first time since 1968 that a Chicago mayor had asked for the National Guard's help in dealing with civil unrest and disturbances. On Sunday morning, Target announced that it would be closing its seven locations in the Chicago neighborhoods of Hyde Park, McKinley Park, South Loop, State Street, Streeterville, Wilson Yard and West Loop. Just before noon, Lightfoot called for a moment of silence at 5pm. At approximately 3 pm, Metra suspended its services to and from Chicago's downtown. Despite these new measures, reports of looting, window-breaking and other crimes began coming in, not from the downtown area as it had happened on the previous day, but from multiple areas across the entire city of Chicago in the early afternoon. At 3:30 pm, a group of about 24 officers were sighted at the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Kedzie Avenue, where a shopping strip seemed to have been looted. Cell phone stores, hair-braiding shops and a Family Dollar location were damaged during the afternoon. In West Garfield Park, multiple storefronts were looted Sunday afternoon along Madison Street. A billow of smoke over Madison Street from a burning business was sighted east of Karlov Avenue. Shortly before 4 pm, the windows of Bronzeville Finer Foods were shattered. Just west of the Bronzeville Finer Foods, protesters gathered in front of Chicago Police headquarters, where officers stood in front of the entrance. At Guaranteed Rate Field, members of the Illinois National Guard set up a staging area in Lot A with Humvees. A dozen blocks south of the staging area, at the intersection of 47th Street and Halsted Avenue in Canaryville, protesters looted the City Sports Outlet. One man at the scene of the looting was nearly hit by a car. Further east, at the intersection of 47th Street and Michigan Avenue in Bronzeville, looters broke into a Western Union location. In the Little Village neighborhood, looters stole products and merchandise from a shoe store and a T-Mobile location. Looters took to stealing from clothing and shoe stores on the Commercial Avenue shopping strip in the South Chicago neighborhood. The Chatham shopping mall near the intersection of 87th Street and Dan Ryan Expressway was also looted, with shopping carts littered throughout the Jewel and Home Depot parking lots. Demonstrators also entered a nearby Family Dollar. Starting at 6:30 pm, at the request of authorities, the CTA suspended service on all bus routes and rail lines, according to its website. A fire was reported near the intersection of 59th Street and Ashland Avenue, while another one occurred at the intersection of 55th Street and Kedzie Avenue. Simultaneously, a group of demonstrators marched into Lake Shore Drive and blocked traffic for around twenty minutes despite police barricades, leading to heavy traffic. Crowds marched through the Hyde Park and River North neighborhoods on the evening of the 31st. In River North, officers utilized batons to beat protesters. In Old Town, a standoff between demonstrators and police lasted hours. Farther south in the city, the Walgreens location at the intersection of 79th Street and Racine Avenue was \\"emptied out\\". Around 9 pm, a group of mostly peaceful protesters were marching in downtown Chicago, and the crowd entered Lake Shore Drive, heading northbound before exiting. Also at about 9 pm, a fire at a shopping strip near was put out. Around 10:50 pm, on the 4200 west block of Van Buren Street, an 18-year-old woman was fatally shot in the head. Several hours earlier, a man was fatally shot, with two others being wounded while the three were standing outside with a group on the 5100 west block of Madison Street in the Austin neighborhood. In addition, two women were shot while driving on the 500 west block of Pershing Avenue when a mini-van pulled up and its occupant opened fire. In another incident, police stated that two men were shot while they walked down the 1200 north block of Washtenaw Avenue. One victim was shot in the hip, and the other was shot in the hand. Multiple stores in Washington Park were looted during the evening, and another wave of looting appeared in the Wicker Park neighborhood, starting on Sunday night and lasting well into the early hours of Monday, June 1. Dozens of people were seen near a Foot Locker in the vicinity of the Milwaukee and Ashland Avenues intersection in Wicker Park. Firefighters responded early Monday to a fire at the 95th Street shopping center in the Jeffery Manor neighborhood. According to initial reports, 82 people were shot, 19 fatally, in Chicago over the May 30‚Äì31 weekend. The weekend surpassed the previous May 23‚Äì24 weekend, which was the most deadly Memorial Day weekend in Chicago since 2015 with 49 individuals shot in total and 9 deaths, becoming the most deadly weekend of the year to that date. Over half of the May 30‚Äì31 weekend victims were shot on Sunday. =June 1= CPS grab-and-go meal sites, which were started in April as response to the COVID-19 pandemic, were closed on Monday the 1st but scheduled meal delivery will continue. Additionally, all Illinois community-based COVID-19 testing sites were closed on June 1. Also that morning, all exit ramps for the I-90/94 from 18th Street to Division Street were shut down until further notice. At a press conference on Monday morning, Mayor Lightfoot denied that the city prioritized protecting the Loop over neighborhoods on the South and West Side over the weekend. \\"There is no way, no way, we would ever let any neighborhood receive more resources and protection than any others. Ever,\\" Lightfoot stated. \\"That certainly didn‚Äôt happen over the course of the weekend...We did not stand by and let the South and West Sides burn as some are propagating.\\" The city had shut down most access to Chicago's downtown the previous day after protesters burnt and looted businesses in the Loop. As a result of the measures, looters took to South and West Side neighborhoods. Chicago authorities were stationed across the city but were overwhelmed, Lightfoot said. The city's authorities had apparently received 65,000 calls in a 24-hour period. \\"The fact is, the violence that we saw and the looting we saw spread like a wildfire,\\" she added. Police Superintendent Brown stated that 699 looting arrests were made on the 31st, and that at least 132 officers were injured on Sunday. Scenes of protests and looting downtown on June 2 The Nike location at the intersection of 85th Street and Cottage Grove saw looting around 2 pm. At 4 pm, a peaceful protest of several hundred people occurred on Lincoln Avenue. An hour later, demonstrators were gathered at Belmont and Wilton Avenues in the Lake View neighborhood, and the demonstration remained calm. At 6:30 pm, the march that had begun in Lake View reached the intersection of Broadway and Sunnyside avenues in Uptown. Around 7:30 pm, the CTA and Metra announced it would suspend its service for the night again. At 7:50 pm, demonstrators in Uptown went southbound on Broadway before heading east on Irving Park Road towards Lake Shore Drive. 30 minutes later, the same group of demonstrators was marching north on Lake Shore Drive. Shortly after the 9 pm curfew began, police officers confronted a group of men on Broadway Avenue who were throwing rocks and bricks. The group was dispersed by the officers, who did not use any chemical irritants. During the weekend, it was reported that the hacktivist group Anonymous had infiltrated the Chicago Police's radio systems, blaring \\"Fuck tha Police\\" by N.W.A to disrupt radio communication. The economic cost of the riots and looting in the final days of May through June 1 were estimated at $66 million.2 Months After Looting And Unrest, Many Chicago Businesses Still Need Help Rebuilding Retrieved August 23, 2020 =August 9-10= After the police shot a man in Englewood, hundreds of people rioted in Northern Chicago. The riots primarily targeted the Magnificent Mile, where dozens of stores were looted, causing over $60 million in damage.Black Lives Matter holds rally in Chicago to support those arrested after looting, unrest Retrieved August 23, 2020 The rioters clashed with police, wounding at least 13 police officers and inflicting damage upon police cars. In an attempt to hinder the movements of the rioters, bus and train services were suspended, several drawbridges were raised, and freeways were shut down. Two people were shot during the rioting, a bystander and a private security guard from the Loop, the latter of whom was hospitalized in critical condition, and over 100 people were arrested in connection with the looting. Although the police department and the mayor of Chicago stated that the initial police shooting involved a confrontation with Latrell Allen, a 20-year-old man who had fled from the police and then fired his weapon at them, many of the rioters were led to believe that the police had instead shot and killed a 15-year-old boy, a belief that the mayor described as a 'false rumor on social media.' Black Lives Matter Chicago disputed the police version of events and renewed its calls for reform of the Chicago Police Department, which they say has an extensive record of racism and abusive tactics.https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/08/10/security-guard-in-critical- condition-after-shooting-in-the- loop/https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-chicago-downtown- looting-20200810-3zwa3b7zzrc5vdyb4qjqywrjvu- story.htmlhttps://www.newsweek.com/what-happened-chicago-looting-protests- police-1524053 References Category:2020 in Illinois Category:2020s in Chicago Category:Articles containing video clips Illinois, Chicago Category:Riots and civil disorder in Illinois Category:2020 riots ","title":"George Floyd protests in Chicago"},{"id":"64144722","text":"Gottlieb St√§uble (27 April 1929 ‚Äì 24 April 2015) was a Swiss footballer who played in the late 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.

The following season 1949‚Äì50 St√§uble played 25 league games and with 13 goals was the teams best scorer and 8th best league scorer. St√§uble played with Basel until the end of the 1950‚Äì51 Nationalliga A season. That season he played 17 league matches and scored seven goals. In the 3rd principal round of the Swiss Cup on 29 October 1950 in the away match against FC M√ºnchenstein he scored his first hat-trick in this competition. During the summer break 1951 St√§uble joined BSC Young Boys, where he stayed for two seasons. Then he joined Lausanne-Sport, where he also stayed two seasons. Then during the summer of 1955 St√§uble rejoined his club of origin. This was the period in which the club, under chairman Jules D√ºblin, started employing more semi-professional players and paying langer sums for the transfers of new players, because the team was playing in the lower midfield of the domestic league and were in danger of relegation. Together with the new trainer B√©la S√°rosi (FC Lugano) and new players such as Silvan Th√ºler (FC Solothurn) and J√ºrgen Sanmann (Concordia Hamburg), St√§uble was to help improve the teams situation. Indeed, he fitted in well with striker colleague Josef \\"Seppe\\" H√ºgi. H√ºgi scored 19 times during the 1955‚Äì56 season and St√§uble 18, together they scored more than half of the teams goals. However, in the four years in his second period with the club, they never rose above fouth position in the table. Between the years 1946 and 1951, and again from 1955 to 1959 St√§uble played a total of 286 games for Basel scoring a total of 123 goals. 185 of these games were in the Nationalliga A, 23 in the Swiss Cup and 78 were friendly games. He scored 81 goals in the domestic league, 13 in the Swiss Cup and the other 29 were scored during the test games. Following his time with Basel, St√§uble moved on to play for Biel-Bienne. He stayed with them, apart from a short period with FC Bern, until the end of his active football career. International career St√§uble was called up for the Swiss national team in the 1950‚Äì51 season. However, his only short appearance for them was for 15 minutes as he was substituted in for Hans-Peter Friedl√§nder in October 1950 in front of almost 24,000 spectators in the Stadion Rankhof in Basel during a friendly against the Netherlands for the last quarter of an hour. He helped his FC Basel teammate Ren√© Bader to complete the Swiss 7‚Äì5 victory. Private life After his career as an active footballer St√§uble returned to his home town Basel. As a trained businessman, he worked 30 years for the Cardinal Brewery in Rheinfelden. St√§uble was married twice. Together with his first wife Angelina they had two daughters. His younger daughter Claudine St√§uble also entered into top-class sport. She played handball with the then series champions ATV Basel-Stadt. She won four Swiss titles with them in the Spar Premium League. ReferencesSources * Die ersten 125 Jahre.

He was the first black television news reporter in Oregon (as well as in the Pacific Northwest as a whole) and later served two terms as a Portland city commissioner. Early life Bogle was born in Portland in 1930 to Richard W. Bogle, a businessman, and Kathryn Hall Bogle, a journalist and activist. His great-grandparents, Richard Arthur and America Waldo Bogle, were some of the first black settlers in the Pacific Northwest. Growing up on Tibbetts Street, Bogle attended Hosford Grade School and graduated from Washington High School. He then attended Oregon State College and Vanport Extension Center (now Portland State University). Career After college, Bogle worked as an insurance fraud investigator. In 1952, he published a jazz review and an endorsement of Adlai Stevenson for U.S. president in the Portland Challenger newspaper, which was founded by William A. Hilliard and targeted the black community. He also served as Associate Editor of the Challenger.https://content.library.pdx.edu/files/PDXScholar/Portland- Challenger-December-23-1952/2/#zoom=z He continued to write jazz and sports articles for the Portland Reporter and worked as a police officer from 1959 to 1968. Bogle was hired as a reporter for KATU in January 1968 and assigned to cover that year's primary election. In September of that year, he interviewed Melvin Belli, and in 1973 he became an anchor of Eyewitness News. Bogle continued to work for KATU until 1982, when he was hired as City Commissioner Mildred Schwab's executive assistant. In 1984, City Commissioner Charles Jordan, the first black commissioner (member of the city council) in Portland, announced his resignation, and Bogle entered the race to succeed him. He won 28 percent in the initial round, and defeated Herb Cawthorne with 55 percent in the runoff. He was re-elected in 1988 but lost in 1992. His 1992 loss was attributed to several controversies, such as a $20,000 settlement on a sexual harassment claim and a $1,500 trip to Asia on the taxpayer's dime. After leaving politics, Bogle turned back to writing, publishing articles in DownBeat, Senior Lifestyles, The Christian Science Monitor, and The Skanner. He also took and published photos of jazz artists. He volunteered as a jazz DJ for KMHD and for the Portland Police Bureau's cold case unit. Personal life Bogle's third marriage was to jazz singer Nola Sugai Porter in 1977, and they had three children together (in addition to two children Porter had from a previous relationship). They moved to Vancouver, Washington, in 2005. He died in Vancouver on February 25, 2010, from congestive heart failure.

She holds a joint position at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology. Her research investigates the molecular mechanisms that give rise to Parkinson's disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gandhi was involved with the epidemiological investigations and testing efforts at the Francis Crick Institute.  Early life and education  Gandhi studied neuroscience at Trinity College, Cambridge, and earned her bachelor's degree in 1996. She moved to the University of Oxford to complete a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (BM BCh) degree in medicine. She was a trainee neurologist at the Hammersmith Hospital, National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery and Whittington Hospital. In 2004 she was awarded a Wellcome Trust fellowship to work toward a doctoral degree in neuroscience at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology, and completed her PhD in 2009.  Research and career  She was awarded an National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) lectureship at Imperial College London in 2009. In 2012 she was awarded a Wellcome Trust intermediate clinical fellowship to study the misfolding of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson's disease, and how this misfolding causes neurotoxicity. Gandhi established her laboratory at the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology in 2013. Her research group develop human- derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models of disease, with a focus on understanding how the aggregation of alpha-synuclein, a protein encoded by the SNCA gene, impacts cell physiology. She makes use of single-molecule FRET and mitochondrial physiology to study the behaviour of alpha-synuclein at the molecular level. In 2016 Gandhi was awarded a secondment at the Francis Crick Institute. Gandhi and co-workers showed that clumps of alpha-synuclein can be toxic to neural function, damaging proteins on the surface of mitochondria. This damage forced a channel on mitochondria to open and made them less efficient in their production of energy, causing them to swell and leak essential chemicals ‚Äì eventually causing the cell to die. To perform the experiments, Gandhi and colleagues turned human skin cells into stem cells, which were converted into brain cells that could be investigated into the laboratory. She was part of a team who investigated the use of exenatide as a means to slow the progression of multiple system atrophy. In February 2020 Gandhi was awarded an Medical Research Council (MRC) clinical fellowship to study the fundamental origins of Parkinson's disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gandhi studied the epidemiology of coronavirus disease. In particular, Gandhi was interested in how the virus evolved throughout the course of the pandemic, how it impacted ht nervous system and how it was transmitted between people. She was also involved with the COVID-19 testing that took place at the Francis Crick Institute. = Selected publications = Gandhi's publications include: * A common LRRK2 mutation in idiopathic Parkinson's disease * Mechanism of Oxidative Stress in Neurodegeneration * PINK1-Associated Parkinson's Disease Is Caused by Neuronal Vulnerability to Calcium-Induced Cell Death  References  Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Cambridge Category:British women neuroscientists Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Parkinson's disease researchers ","title":"Sonia Gandhi (scientist)"},{"id":"64144776","text":"Peter Boroffka (May 14, 1932 - December 24, 1999) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and former member of the German Bundestag.

She entered Trinity College Dublin (TCD) to study modern history and politics, graduating in 1938 with an honours degree. From early on she had an interest in the education and welfare of children. In her piece published in A danger to men? A history of women in Trinity College Dublin 1904‚Äì2004 (2005) she describes her membership of the Social Service Club of the Elizabethan Society during which she worked to support children living in tenement houses owned by TCD in Grenville Street. She was aware of the huge unemployment and poverty in Dublin, and described an evening lecture organised by the Social Service Club to be given by Philip Townsend Somerville-Large, the founder of the Mount Street Club for the unemployed. The group came up against the issue of the curfew for women on the TCD campus as the lecture was scheduled for an hour after the curfew at 7:30pm. Cochrane had to seek special permission to allow women to attend. She recounted that the women were met at the front gate to be escorted to the benches to sit at the back of the room away from the men, like \\"lepers\\". Career and activism Following her graduation, Cochrane trained as a teacher at Charlotte Mason College, now part of the University of Cumbria, in Ambleside, England. She travelled to Australia, teaching at the Presbyterian Ladies School in Melbourne for five years. She returned to Ireland and attended TCD again, graduating with an MA in history in 1946.

She remained at Ashleigh House until she retired in 1975, teaching history and scripture alongside her administrative duties. After her retirement, Cochrane remained engaged and active with education, environmental and spiritual matters. She was a member of the Belfast Naturalists' Field Club. She was awarded the honorary title of 'Lady Muck' in 1979 by the Ulster Trust for Conservation. For 47 years, she was a member of the Linen Hall Library, and was awarded an honorary membership in recognition in 1999 of her services as governor from 1992 to 1997 and for her support of the library's millennium development fund. For her contribution to the Church of Ireland, she was made a Royal Maundy recipient at St Patrick's Cathedral, Armagh, by Queen Elizabeth II in 2008. This was the first Maundy service to take place outside England and Wales since the services began in medieval times. Death and legacy Cochrane died in Belfast on 23 March 2013.

History  The corps was formed on 19 November 1942 as the 5th Guards Don Cossack Cavalry Corps, assigned to the Northern Group of Forces of the Transcaucasian Front. Under the command of Major General Alexey Selivanov, the corps was assigned the 11th and 12th Guards Don Cossack Cavalry Divisions, the 63rd Cavalry Division, and other units. Its divisions had already seen combat during the Battle of the Caucasus in the preceding months. The corps entered battle as a unit for the first time in early December in the region of Mozdok. Between January and May 1943 it fought as part of the North Caucasian Front and later the Southern Front with a cavalry-mechanized group. Between September and November the corps fought as part of the Southern Front (renamed the 4th Ukrainian Front on 20 October) in the breakthrough of the Mius-Front, in which it recaptured Volnovakha on 10 September, Guliaipole on 16 September, Melitopol on 23 October, and Kakhovka on 2 November. In January and February 1944 the corps was shifted to the 2nd Ukrainian Front for the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive, in which it fought in the encirclement and destruction of German troops. For its \\"exemplary fulfillment of combat missions\\" in the fighting for Zvenigorodka on 28 January, and the \\"courage and bravery\\" of its personnel, the corps was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 13 February. During March and April the corps fought in the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive. In early April, Selivanov, ill with tuberculosis, was replaced by former corps deputy commander Major General Sergey Gorshkov. During the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, the corps formed the cavalry-mechanized group of the front together with the 23rd Tank Corps. Swiftly advancing on the right flank of the front, it ensured the advance of the shock group. From October 1944 the corps, transferred to the 3rd Ukrainian Front on 27 November, participated in the Battle of Debrecen. In the attack on Em≈ëd on 13 November, 12th Guards Cavalry Division platoon commander Senior Sergeant Pyotr Grigoryevich Kuznetsov was surrounded, but defended his position to the death. For his actions, Kuznetsov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. For \\"successful combat actions\\" and its part in the destruction of the Axis forces surrounded in Budapest, the corps received the name of the city as an honorific on 5 April 1945. The corps saw its last action in the Vienna Offensive in the final weeks of the war. For their actions during the war, roughly 32,000 soldiers of the corps were decorated, and ten became Heroes of the Soviet Union. The corps was disbanded in July 1946.  Postwar  In mid-1945, the 63rd Cavalry Division was reorganized into the 12th Mechanized Division. In late 1945, the corps was withdrawn from the Southern Group of Forces, with which it had been stationed at Ploie»ôti, and relocated to Novocherkassk in the Don Military District with the 11th and 12th Guards Cavalry Divisions. The corps was reorganized as the 5th Separate Guards Cavalry Division in May 1946, with the 7th Guards Cavalry Regiment formed from the 37th Guards Cavalry Regiment, and the 11th and 12th Guards Cavalry Regiments formed from the divisions of the same number. The division also included the 120th Tank Regiment, and remained at Novocherkassk as part of the North Caucasus Military District.

He said, \\"I kept practicing and eventually I got better at handling letter form.\\" His graffiti career ended in the early 1980s.

Though graffiti was often associated with hip-hop at this time, Esquire wanted to create an identity for the shows that was not only legible, but professional and stylish. This visual style was in contrast to the settings of most live hip-hop events in the Bronx from the late 1970s and early 1980s: local high schools and community centers. \\"That's what I tried for, you know: give it a level of class even though it was just a ghetto jam,\\" he said.

The library was founded in 1899 under the auspices of the Tolland Public Library Association. It serves a population of 14,838 (as of 2017) by \\"providing library materials and services to support the leisure time, general information, and educational needs of its citizens.\\"  Services  Like most public libraries, the Tolland Public Library provides reading and audiovisual materials for borrowing, adult and children's programming, public computers with internet access, interlibrary loan, and reference services. Additionally, the library offers more specialized services such as a makerspace, a small business resource center, Oculus Rift virtual reality stations, and various electronic databases, including Ancestry.com. In 2019, the library reported 4905 individuals registered as cardholders, 99,179 items borrowed, 7207 reference questions asked, and 97,098 visits made to the building.  Foundation  The Tolland Public Library Foundation provides funding to support library programming and collections. The largest portion of its funding consists of income from the Phoebe Dimock King and Elizabeth C. King Eaton Endowment, established in 2009 by the daughter of a former Tolland library employee. Funds support author talks and other educational programming, as well as digital access to Ancestry.com, Newsweek magazine, and other digital resources for library cardholders. Similarly, the Friends of the Tolland Public Library raise donations, host programs, and run a small booksale room inside the library.  History  In 1898, the Tolland Public Library Association was formed for the purpose of starting a free library for residents of Tolland. Mrs. Hamilton R. Downing led the effort. In 1901, the Tolland Public Library Association was incorporated by a charter from the Connecticut General Assembly. Twenty-five local women were charter members. Two or three rooms in the Tolland County Courthouse were designated to house the library, furnishings were donated, and funds to purchase books were raised by subscription. The library opened to the public on January 1, 1899 with a collection of 400 books. The number of volumes in the library's collection rose to 5584 in 1948, 12,046 by 1970, 25,000 in 1985, and 71,604 in 2018. Early collections were developed largely through funding from a yearly state grant of $100. From 1898 until her retirement in 1948, Miss Lucille Agard, a lifelong resident of Tolland, served as town librarian. In 1906, Tolland Library received a $10,000 bequest from prominent industrialist and state legislator Ratcliffe Hicks, who had died earlier that year in Interlaken, Switzerland. His daughter, Elizabeth Hicks, later served as an honorary vice president on the Tolland Public Library Association's board of directors. In 1974, Elizabeth willed the Hicks' family home in Tolland to a nonprofit trust, which converted the house into the Hicks-Stearns Family Museum. In 1930, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Simpson purchased the County Courthouse from Tolland County, as authorized under a special act of the state legislature. For one dollar, the Simpsons deeded the building to the library association. The building continued to house the probate courts for Tolland and neighboring Ellington until 1960. In 1977, a town committee recommended construction of a new and modernized library. In 1983, the town voted to appropriate $1.3 million to renovate and expand the vacated Hicks Memorial School (built in 1908), just down the street from the Courthouse, for mixed use as the Hicks Municipal Center and Library. A state grant of $115,000 supported construction. The Town of Tolland Charter was revised in 1984 and established a library with a six- member advisory board appointed by the town council. Library staff were to report up to the town manager. On October 24, 1985, the library moved to its new and substantially larger location. In November 2013, a referendum authorized the Town to appropriate $2.6 million for a library expansion, converting the small municipal gymnasium next door into a library space. Of the $2.6 million, $1 million came from a Connecticut State Library grant and another $500,000 came from a Connecticut Small Town Economic Assistance Program (STEAP) grant. The rest of the money was raised through bonding. The expanded library reopened on March 30, 2017. The library grew its footprint from 11,162 square feet to 16,062 square feet. The expanded facilities featured more seating and study spaces, a makerspace with a 3D printer, and an 84-seat program room.

History Sunset Heights Realty Co., established by Richard Rodgers, developed Sunset Heights after the company was created on August 15, 1910. The Houston Heights, when it was an independent municipality, unsuccessfully attempted to annex Sunset Heights. The City of Houston annexed Sunset Heights in 1927. By 2001 gentrification occurred in the area, with some smaller houses being torn down in favor of newer ones. East Sunset Heights Association was established in March 2002. By October of that year, there were 97 members. In 2006 Sunset Heights homeowners signed a petition to the city government to establish a minimum lot size. Minimum lot sizes are pursued when area residents wish to oppose existing lots being divided into smaller ones for townhouses. Later that year the Houston City Planning commission approved the development of a condominium project that went against the wishes of the people who signed the petition even though it strictly speaking complied with the city code planning regulations. The planning commission also chose not to submit a request for deliberating the minimum lot size to Houston City Council, as seven planning commission members voted against it; six voted to do so. Tom Manning of the Houston Chronicle stated that residents disagreed on the issue. On August 8, 2007, Houston City Council did establish a minimum lot size for this area. In the Planning Commission barred a property owner from going below East Sunset Heights' minimum property size. Geography Many of the houses in the neighborhood are bungalows. East Sunset Heights; roughly between Airline Drive, 23rd Street, the 610 Loop, and North Main; has about 400 houses. Education The neighborhood is within the Houston Independent School District (HISD). \\\\- JPG - Index map for Sunset Heights - Compare this map to HISD school boundary maps.

It was built in 1912 after taxpayers voted in favor for a referendum to build the school; the taxpayers had raised $20,000 for this purpose beginning the previous year. In 1926 the school was put in a new building and was now known as Alamo Elementary School; it was in Sunset Heights block 76. \\\\- JPG - Sunset Heights Block 76, school site indicated.

It is located in the city of Ann Arbor in Washtenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It was built by the Detroit Edison Company in 1920 for hydroelectricity before being decommissioned in 1959 and sold to the city of Ann Arbor in 1963. The surrounding area is used for recreational purposes, including Argo Nature Area and Bandemer Park. Description The Argo Dam is located in north-central Ann Arbor about south of M-14 (Bus. US 23). The dam is accessible just south of the highway via exit 3 (North Main Street). The Argo Dam is approximately from the Huron River mouth at Lake Erie. The nearest dams are the Barton Dam upstream and the Geddes Dam downstream. When the dam was completed, the resulting flooding created an unnamed reservoir of . The reservoir has no official name but is sometimes referred to as the Argo Pond or Argo Impoundment. It sits at an average elevation of above sea level and has an average depth of . The reservoir has no noticeable storage capacity or alteration to the surrounding area; it is considered a pondage reservoir. The reservoir extends for about upstream from the dam to U.S. Route 23, and it has a maximum width of only . The entire shoreline is considered natural with no major alterations to the original landscape. The dam consists of six automated spillways for a total crest length of and a dam length of . The dam is tall and has a discharge capacity of 8,500 cubic feet per second (240.7 m3/s). The dam is one of four dams owned by the city of Ann Arbor. The other dams are the Barton Dam, Geddes Dam, and Superior Dam. Only the Argo Dam and Barton Dam are actually within the city of Ann Arbor. Geddes Dam is within Ann Arbor Township, and Superior Dam is in neighboring Superior Township to the east. History This stretch of the Huron River was dammed as early as the 1830s. The Argo Dam was completed in 1920 as a series of hydroelectric dams built along the Huron River by the Detroit Edison Company. The Argo Dam was decommissioned in 1959 and no longer utilized for hydroelectric purposes. The dam was soon sold to the city of Ann Arbor in 1963. The dam was rebuilt entirely in 1972 and utilized to maintain water level in the reservoir and for flood control. At one time, the Detroit Edison Company operated four hydroelectric dams that served Ann Arbor: Argo Dam, Barton Dam, Geddes Dam, and Superior Dam. They were all decommissioned by the early-1960s, but Barton Dam and Superior Dam were recommissioned in the 1980s and currently provide hydroelectricity for Ann Arbor's power grid. Geddes Dam and Argo Dam were left decommissioned, because higher cost estimates and lower energy production kept them from being approved for recommissioning. In 2008, a plan was initially conceived by the city of Ann Arbor to possibly recommission the Argo Dam and Geddes Dam in order to provide additional electric power to the nearby Ann Arbor VA Medical Center. In 2010, the report found it would cost up to $14.7 million to construct new hydroelectric stations at both decommissioned dams. The transmission lines themselves would cost another $1.3 million, with at least $220,000 per year for maintenance. Funding was ultimately denied. In order to recommission the Argo Dam for hydroelectric purposes, a new powerhouse would also have to be constructed with limited space available due to development of the area. In 2013, the city approved a financial plan to improve the surrounded areas of both Argo Dam and Geddes Dam at a cost of $295,530 to a local contractor. The dam received these significant improvements in 2014, but the idea of recommissioning the dam for hydroelectric purposes was abandoned. =Proposed removal= When the dam was deemed insufficient and too costly to reactivate for hydroelectric purposes, various proposals to completely remove the dam were discussed. The most beneficial ecological reasons for removing the Argo Dam included creating a more stable water temperature for the Huron River, as well as providing a more natural flow of the river for at least from the Barton Dam to the Geddes Dam. Removing the dam would also allow for increased fish populations, as the reservoir itself does not support a high population of fish. Due to the slow-moving water of the reservoir, undesirable zebra mussels are very abundant and would dissipate under a faster water flow. The cost of removing the dam may also be funded by federal economic-stimulus dollars. Removing the dam would lower the water level and uncover an estimated of usable park land along the river, as well as increasing the navigable course of the river for kayaks. Opponents of the dam's removal cite that lowering the water level would not immediately be useful, and there are no cost or time estimates on how long it would take to convert the mud basin into usable land. There are also no studies that indicate a rising fish population should the dam be removed. The city council has been unable to agree upon an adequate plan for removing the dam. The reservoir also provides a slow-moving rowing environment, which is utilized as a practice course by the University of Michigan women's rowing team and other high school teams. In 2010, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources gave permission for the city to keep the dam in place and allow for additional funding to improve the surrounding landscape. The dam was considered \\"safe and did not need repairs\\" itself, but continued maintenance would be necessary. The dam's good structural integrity also played a role in the decision to keep the dam. Activities The artificial Argo Cascades allows kayakers to bypass the dam and continue along the Huron River. The area surrounding the Argo Dam reservoir is owned by the city and encompasses two city parks. The Argo Nature Area occupies along the entire eastern shores of the reservoir, and Bandemer Park occupies along a portion of the western banks. Barton Nature Area is another city-owned park further upstream near Barton Dam. The Border-to-Border Trail, which runs for from Dexter Township to Ypsilanti Township, passes directly across the Argo Dam and also provides public amenities. The Argo Dam reservoir serves as a popular kayaking location along the Huron River. The city of Ann Arbor owns the Argo Pond Livery for kayak and canoe rentals. In 2012, the city completed a project to create the artificial Argo Cascades along the original route of the former hydroelectric plant, which forms an artificial island. The swift- moving waters descend over a length of . The cascades allows kayakers to continue the course of the Huron River without needing to portage over the Argo Dam, although portaging is an option for those wishing to bypass the cascades. When the Argo Dam was reconstructed in 1972, the river was treated with rotenone to eliminate all fish populations along this stretch of river. After the dam project was completed, the Argo Dam reservoir was restocked with various fish species, such as smallmouth bass, walleye, hybrid sunfish, and rainbow trout. Channel catfish were intermittently stocked throughout the following decades. Common carp, suckerfish, and longnose gar were also introduced in the area. Fish stocking was discontinued after 2000 due to poor survival and low angler use. The Argo Dam continues to serve as a recreational area for shore fishing in either the reservoir or the area immediately downstream along the Huron River. Common fish caught today within this area include channel catfish, bluegill, small and largemouth bass, black crappie, northern pike, and walleye. =Health concerns= The Huron River is occasionally issued a \\"Do Not Eat\\" fish advisory by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services when the waters accumulate high levels of cyanobacteria and perfluorooctanesulfonatecan (PFOS). When this bacteria is present, prolonged contact with the water is not advised, although occasional contact with PFOS is not considered a health concern. When the advisory is in place, fishermen are advised to catch and release only, and warning signs are posted at river access points. The advisory is often issued for long stretches of the Huron River that include and specifically mention the Argo Dam portion of the river.

While memory is a word often used in an human-centric light, this basic definition can be extended to many other organisms that exhibit delayed responses to a stimulus, including plants. Many examples can be seen across nature like from plants timing their leaves to rise in synchrony with the sun rising, to producing new leaves in the spring after overwintering. Plant memory is different from human and animal memory in that it does not involve the storage of memory in a brain structure, but does function similarly by using experiences to benefit the organism's survival later in life. Human memory is often thought to be a very complex process mechanistically, but very little is actually known about how memories are created and stored. When discussing human memory, there are three important categories to consider. This first type of memory is sensory, which involves rapid input of stimulus around a person. Sensory memory is constant, but fleeting. This would include sounds, light, smells, and other basic stimuli. The next type of memory in humans is short term memory, which is maintained much longer than sensory memory. Another category of human memory is long term. This includes the ability to recall life moments weeks, months, and even years after an experience. Each of these types of human memory can be broken down to a basic process of retention and response. This pattern of processes can also be observed in plants. The most basic learning and memory functions in animals have been recorded in plants, and it is proposed that the development of these basic memory mechanisms were developed by an early organismal ancestor. Plants not only have developed conserved ways to use functioning memory, but some species have also developed unique ways to use memory function depending on their environment and life history. In this way, one can see that there is another similarity between the evolution of plant memory and the evolution of animal memory among the different species of each.The use of the term plant memory sparks some controversy in the field of plant biology, as some researchers believe this function only applies to organisms with a functioning brain. Some researchers believe that comparing plant functions that resemble memory in humans and other higher division organisms may be too direct of a comparison, while others believe that since the function of the two are essentially the same this comparison can act as a basis of knowledge for further understanding how these functions in plants work. In order to better define the parallels and differences of these functions in both plants and animals, more studies are necessary.  History  One of the first experiments to delve into the idea of plant memory was not intended to do so at all. Scientist Mark Jaffe was conducting an experiment to get to the bottom of the mechanism behind the curling of pea plant tendrils. Jaffe knew that pea plants would coil around objects that would give them support and help them grow. In his experiments, Jaffe rubbed one side of a pea plant tendril to mimic a support object and to see if the contact would induce the coiling behavior. He also decided to test the effects of light on this process and that is when he stumbled upon an example of plant memory. When Jaffe rubbed the tendrils in light he witnessed the expected coiling response. Interestingly, when he did the same procedure in the dark, the pea plant tendrils no longer responded to the physical contact. When the tendrils from the dark experiment were brought back into light hours later, they exhibited a coiling response without any further stimulus. This demonstrated that somehow the pea tendrils retained the stimulus that Jaffe had provided and responded to it at a later time. After this discovery, many scientists wanted to further pursue how exactly plants could retain information. The Venus flytrap suggests one possible mechanism. The carnivorous plant has many tiny hairs along its trap‚Äôs surface. When these hairs are touched, the response of shutting the trap is triggered. One important caveat to this process is that when just one hair is touched the response is not triggered. This made many scientists, pause and wonder what mechanism was behind reaching the threshold for closing the trap. They wondered how the plant retained how many stimuli had occurred. Dieter Hodick and Andrias Sievers wanted to get to the bottom of this in the late 1980s. They proposed a model by which the memory of the stimulus was retained through calcium concentrations. Similar to human action potentials, they hypothesized that the first stimulus led to an increase of calcium. These levels are retained, allowing memory. If the second stimulus takes too long to occur, then the combined calcium levels will not surpass the threshold required to trigger the trap shutting. In this way, the memory would be lost. If the second stimulus occurred quickly enough, then the calcium levels would breach the threshold and trigger the trap to close. This demonstrated delayed response to the stimulus.The maintenance of the initial trigger through calcium levels is an example of a mechanism by which short-term memory can occur in plants. Even though this is not what many would consider human memory, the fundamentals of what have occurred are the same. The storage of the input, whether it be a smell to a human or a touch to a plant, is fundamentally the same in terms of the previously discussed definition of basic memory. As this field of study moves forward, some new questions regarding plants‚Äô abilities to retain information have arisen. One such question surrounds the length of plant memory. While evidence supported short term retention of signals, some scientists wanted to see if plants could retain information for longer periods of time similar to the way that humans can. Monica Gagliano‚Äôs research is often at the forefront of this discussion. Gagliano performed experiments from which she observed plants retaining memory for up to a month. Gagliano used the mimosa pudica plant for her experiment. This plant is very sensitive and will curl up its leaves in response to touch or shaking. Gagliano performed an experiment in which these plants were dropped sixty times. She observed that overtime the response of leaf curling when dropped decreased in her plants.She controlled for the plants simply being worn out by shaking them after the dropping experiments, which elicited the defense response of curling up their leaves. This showed that the plants still had the energy necessary to respond, but that they remembered that the dropping stimulus didn‚Äôt require expending it. This first part of her experiment demonstrates short term memory in the plants. At the very least, this part of the experiment shows that from the time of one drop to the next, the plants retained that the drop was not a threat She concluded that the plants were able to remember from the previous responses that the dropping was not dangerous. Gagliano went further with this experiment and wanted to see how long the plant would retain the information for. In order to test this, she waited a month and then repeated the dropping experiment again and observed that the plants had retained the memory of not needing a defense response when provided the dropping stimulus.This research set a new precedent for the length of plant memory. Originally thought to only occur for short durations, Gagliano‚Äôs work supports the need for further research into the extent of time over which plants can retain information. Another question is whether the nature of plant memory is ‚Äòintelligent‚Äô. When thinking of human memory, it is often moments of importance that then stick long term. Making a human memory involves some levels of deciding what information is important to keep and what information will not be as helpful in the future. Such evaluations are part of what is considered intelligent memory. Further progress in this field of study will likely focus on whether or not the nature of plant memory is considered intelligent, which presents the issue of how intelligence itself is defined.  Physiology  The physiology of plant memory is documented in many studies and is understood to have four main physiological mechanisms that work together in synchrony to provide the plant with basic memory functions, and are thought to be precursors to advanced memory functions found in animals. These four mechanisms are the storing and recalling, habituation, gene priming or epigenetics, and the biological clock. = Storage and recall = The storage and recall method of memory occurs when a plant, in response to a stimuli, reduces or increases the concentration of a chemical in certain tissues, and maintains this concentration for a certain period of time. The plant then uses this concentration of chemical as a signal for a recall response. Stimuli known to create a store and recall responses like this are touch, damage, temperature, and even electromagnetic radiation. It is suspected that Ca2+ signalling plays a key role in this form of plant memory. A proposed mechanism of this is that the presence or absence of Ca2+ acts as a long term on/off switch for cellular processes in response to stimuli for storing genes. Ca2+ along with electrical signalling, is also integral as a signalling pathway for plants to transmit signals of the original stimulus between cells or tissues throughout the plant. An example of short term electrical memory store and recall function can be seen in the trap mechanism of the Venus flytrap. When one hair on the trap is touched, an electrical is generated and retained for 20 seconds. The trap requires that at least one more hair is brushed within this 20 second period in order to reach the charge threshold required to close the trap. Electrical signaling from cell to cell in plants is controlled by proteins in the cell membrane. Protein memristors are biological resistor proteins that can depend on the electrical history of the cell, and are a class of protein that are shared between plants and animals in electrical memory function.Balu≈°ka, F., Gagliano, Monica, & Witzany, G√ºnther. (2018). Memory and learning in plants (Signaling and communication in plants). Cham, Switzerland: Springer. = Habituation = The process of habituation in plants is very similar to the store and recall function, but lacks the recall action. In this case, information is stored and used to acclimate the plant to the original stimulus. A great example of this is research done on mimosa plants by and their leave‚Äôs acclimated response to being dropped by Gagliano et. al..Gagliano, M., Vyazovskiy, V., Borb√©ly, A., Grimonprez, M., & Depczynski, M. (2016). Learning by Association in Plants. Scientific Reports, 6(1), 38427. In this study the plants initially reacted to being dropped by closing their leaves, but after the stimulus had been experienced a number of times the plants no longer responded to being dropped by closing their leaves. = Epigenetic memory = The third aspect of plant memory is epigenetics, where the plant, in response to a stimulus, undergoes histone and chromatin modification leading to changes in gene expression. These changes lead to a subsequent change in what proteins are made by the plant and establish a way for the plant to respond or be affected by stimuli from past experiences. These experiences can be passed down heritiarily from parent plant to offspring, giving an even longer term memory of a stimulus such as a stressor or other environmental stimuli. It is important to note that these changes are different from genetic changes because they can be reversed in response to new stimuli or environmental conditions.  Biological clocks  Plants use biological clocks to perform certain actions at times they will be most effective. The two most well documented biological clocks in plants are the day and seasonal cycles which are usually established by photoreceptors. Once a plant has established a pattern of light, they can effectively memorize nighttime, daytime, or longer periods like seasons. A clear example of this can be seen in the ability of plants to over winter, cease leaf growth and then activate leaf growth in the spring when environmental conditions favor growth. These cycles, or circadian rhythms are controlled by genes associated with different spatial times that are activated when an environmental cue for that time is present. These genes control what proteins are made at certain times, as well as electrical and chemical signals that are produced to control motor proteins and other proteins. The overall result of these processes are subsequent changes in how the plant functions.  Summary  The combination of these four mechanisms of plant memory are proposed to work together to form different functions of memory in a plant. The overall proposed mechanism of this memory is a signal or environmental cues lead to a signal (chemical concentration, calcium waves, electrical, small RNAs, or phytohormones), and this eventually leads to the activation or deactivation of memory associated genes (store and recall, epigenetics, habituation, or circadian rhythms). The protein products of these genes then go on to produce actions based on the memory of the initial stimuli. The production and actions of these proteins to a past stimuli is the core of observable plant memory in action. Much is still unknown as to how these four aspects work together, and research as to how they interact should be pursued.

He is known for his contribution to the discovery of the HTT gene that causes Huntington‚Äôs disease.  Early life  David Housman was born on July 20, 1946. As a child he was a control in the original Salk polio vaccine trials in New York, an early experience that left him interested in how clinical trials could be more efficiently conducted.  Academic career  Housman received his BA in 1966 and MA in 1971 from Brandeis University. As one of the first postdocs in the lab of Harvey Lodish at MIT, Housman showed that all mammalian proteins begin with a methionine residue transferred from a specific met-initiator tRNA. Between 1973 and 1975 he taught at the University of Toronto and was on the staff of the Ontario Cancer Institute. He joined the MIT faculty in 1975. In his lab at MIT, he mentored Jim Gusella and Daniel Haber. Housman has co- founded five biotech companies: Integrated Genetics (now part of Genzyme), Somatix Therapy Corp, Viariagenics, Kenna Technologies, and Audacity Therapeutics.  Research  Housman‚Äôs research is focused on the genetics of hereditary disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. His laboratory studies the WT1 gene, whose mutation causes the Wilms‚Äô tumor in the kidneys, and is exploring it as a therapeutic target for leukemia. In 1978 Housman received a grant from the Hereditary Disease Foundation to search for the gene behind Huntington‚Äôs disease using genetic markers, and embarked on this work with Jim Gusella, then a postdoc in his lab at MIT. This led to the discovery of the neighborhood of the gene by Gusella's lab at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1983. The Housman lab is currently investigating the modifier genes responsible for determining the age of onset for Huntington‚Äôs.

Lady Shangguan's father Shangguan An was a friend of Emperor Zhao's sister, Princess Eyi, and her lover, Ding Wairen (‰∏ÅÂ§ñ‰∫∫). He encouraged Ding to persuade the princess on the soundness of the marriage. He argued that the Shangguans' power would be firmer with the marriage, and that they could then help Ding legitimize his relationship with Princess Eyi.

In 83 BC, she was created empress. =First conspiracy= The Shangguans, to show their appreciation to Ding for his role in facilitating the marriage between Empress Shangguan and Emperor Zhao, wanted to have him created a marquess, but this request was rebuffed by Huo, as were their subsequent efforts to have Ding made an important official. This caused Princess Eyi to resent Huos' power and influence. The Shangguans, Princess Eyi, Prince Dan of Yan, and Vice Prime Minister Sang Hongyang (Ê°ëÂºòÁæä) (who was resentful that his monopoly system, which he felt to be the key to sound finances for the state, was being dismantled), formed an anti-Huo conspiracy. In 80 BC, Prince Dan sent a report to Emperor Zhao, accusing Huo of improperly exercising imperial authority. The conspirators' plan was that as soon as Emperor Zhao authorised an investigation, Shangguan Jie and Sang would arrest and immediately execute Huo. However, after the report was given to Emperor Zhao, the 14-year-old Emperor Zhao took no action on it. The next day, he summoned Huo to the palace and exonerated him, reasoning that the actions that Huo was accused of had happened so recently that Prince Dan, a long distance away, could not have possibly known them, and therefore the report must have been false. At this point, the anti-Huo conspiracy was not discovered, but everyone was impressed with the wisdom shown by the young emperor. =Second conspiracy= Later that year, the conspirators tried again. Their plan was for Princess Eyi to invite Huo to a feast, and then to ambush Huo and kill him. They would then depose Emperor Zhao and make Prince Dan emperor. (However, allegedly, the Shangguans conspired to have Prince Dan killed once he arrived in the capital and for Shangguan Jie to declare himself emperor.) The conspiracy was revealed by a servant of Princess Eyi, and the conspirators were arrested and executed along with their entire clans. Princess Eyi and Prince Dan committed suicide. Archaeological finds A section of the Juyan Bamboo Slips () excavated in 1970 refers to a 'senior princess', which is widely believed to denote Princess Eyi. The slips describe that Princess Eyi committed suicide in 80 BCE and that her granddaughter later became Queen of Hejian (). In 2014, it was reported that the Shaanxi Archaeological Research Institute had excavated a large Han tomb in Huaxu Town (), Lantian County, which belonged to Princess Eyi. The burial had originally been suggested to belong to Jing Ke, who attempted to assassinate King Zheng of Qin in 227 BCE. However, wuzhu coins found in the tomb were cast in the yuanshou period (122‚Äì117 BCE) of Emperor Wu of Han, while the bricks used for the tomb interior suggested a date prior to 74 BCE. Additionally, the height of the tomb fit the specifications for a member of the Han nobility, and the terracotta figures accompanying the burial were specifically used by the imperial house. Finally, researchers examined the deceased's bones and found that they belonged to an adult female, leading them to conclude that the tomb was that of Princess Eyi.

January 1848 ‚Äì 22 March 1876) was an Australian pianist of Jewish extraction who had a promising career but died young. He married the soprano Ilma de Murska shortly before his death. History Anderson was the son of James Henri Anderson (1823 ‚Äì 1 May 1879), an accomplished musician who styled himself \\"professor of music\\", and his wife Rachael Anderson (c. 1831 ‚Äì 22 December 1877). J. H. Anderson had arrived in Launceston in 1842 and around 1846 moved to Hobart, where Alfred was born. The lad early showed promise of musical excellence: at age 5¬Ω Tasmanian newspapers were hailing him as a \\"musical wonder\\", and such illustrious men as Sir William Denison and Colonel Butterworth as well as actual musical authorities, were extolling his virtues. His family moved to Melbourne, then to Geelong, and George Coppin hired him for stage performances. He continued to make progress, tutored by his father and by Charles S. Packer the Sydney conductor. In 1857 he was admitted as a student by the Royal Academy of Music, In 1867 his \\"Royal Quadrilles\\" were dedicated to and performed for H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh on the occasion of his visit to Sydney. He studied at the Royal Academy of Music under Ernst Pauer, returning to Sydney in July 1869. =Marriage and death= Anderson was a member of Lyster's concert troupe to New Zealand, whose star was the \\"Polish Nightingale\\" Ilma de Murska. The two were married in Sydney on 29 December 1875. She was obliged to break her schedule a few weeks later in Melbourne, as her husband was gravely ill. As a result, her fans in that city were treated to additional performances, in Lucia di Lammermoor and La Sonnambula, alternating nights with Fannie Simonsen. Anderson, who had been suffering intermittently before the marriage, died on 22 March at his father's house, 1 Lansdown Terrace, East Melbourne. =Controversy= Anderson's estate, valued at ¬£2,300 (many millions in today's currency), was by his will dated 26 February 1876 left to his mother. Allegations were made that much of this sum had been the property of De Murska, and became his through marriage, as the Married Woman‚Äôs Property Act was at that time. Anderson's father was accused by the Melbourne press of preventing De Murska from visiting her husband, strongly denied by J. H. Anderson. Some years later, the New York Sun published (Murska's manager) De Vivo's account of \\"the old Jewish father\\" barring her way with his cane.

The song was released on his 1982 debut album, Marshall Crenshaw. Written as a satire on the \\"mass culture\\" that Crenshaw disliked, the song was not based on a specific girl. \\"Cynical Girl\\" was released as the album's third single in the US and as its first single in the UK. Though the song did not chart, it has since become one of Crenshaw's most famous songs. Background Crenshaw wrote the music to \\"Cynical Girl\\" before the lyrics. He explained, \\"With me it‚Äôs always a piece of music first, and I love the composing part of it so much that I don‚Äôt want to complicate it by trying to think of words; I deal with those separately.\\" He recalled that he wrote the music for \\"Cynical Girl\\" in \\"one pass,\\" but that the lyrics took time to come up with. Crenshaw first came up with the lyrical concept for \\"Cynical Girl\\" after being forced to watch an overhead TV while waiting to pay for a traffic ticket. He later reflected that the lyrics had a \\"humor\\" and \\"oddness\\" to them. The song was not based on a specific girl; Crenshaw explained, In another interview, Crenshaw explained, I hate TV,' ... is an oddball thing to say in a rock 'n' roll song. Whenever I get an idea like that, that's almost too stupid to put in a song, I always put it in.\\" Recording Crenshaw recorded most of \\"Cynical Girl\\" alone in the studio, when he was the album's sole producer. When Richard Gottehrer was brought in to co-produce, he left the song alone aside from the bass line. Crenshaw explained, \\"I had this really awful synth bass that I played, and he goes, 'Well, I'll tell ya, everything's fine but the bass; the bass is awful. Just get rid of that, put a bass guitar on, and it'll be great.' So it's a good thing that he came on board and steered me in the right direction on that track.\\" Crenshaw noted Gottehrer's guidance on the song as \\"one of Richard Gottehrer's really good ideas.\\" Release In the United States, \\"Cynical Girl\\" was released as the third single from Crenshaw's debut album in January 1983. The B-side of the American single included a cover of Buddy Holly's \\"Rave On\\" and the non-album Crenshaw original \\"Somebody Like You\\". The single failed to chart, despite becoming a radio hit on college circuits. In the United Kingdom, the song was released as the album's first single, with \\"You're My Favorite Waste of Time\\" on the B-side. The single did not chart. The song has also appeared on the compilation album This Is Easy: The Best of Marshall Crenshaw and the live albums Live ‚Ä¶My Truck Is My Home and I've Suffered for My Art...Now It's Your Turn. Critical reception In a 1982 review of Marshall Crenshaw for Billboard, Thomas Gabriel praised Crenshaw's guitar playing on the \\"many delicate layers\\" of the song. Stewart Mason of AllMusic lauded the song as \\"a pop song that's absolutely perfect in every way,\\" praising Crenshaw's vocal performance and lyrics as well as Richard Gottehrer's production. Jim Bessman of Billboard called the song a \\"masterful pop creation\\" Don Harrison of Richmond Magazine named the song as one of Crenshaw's \\"pop gems awaiting rediscovery\\", while Noel Murray of The A.V. Club said that the song has \\"enough new-wave edge to make Crenshaw sound vital and modern‚Äînot just a throwback.\\" Crenshaw spoke positively of the song in an interview, stating, \\"People have always really loved that song and identified with it and of course I love that!\\" In another interview, Crenshaw reflected, \\"That one‚Äôs really unique, and I like it a lot. And it's old now, but for many, many years I thought that the lyrics were really cool, and I dug the humor of it.\\" He also called the song one of the best tracks on his debut album.

It is known from this single locality, with possible occurrences in the Brazilian state of Acre.  Description  Trichechus hesperamazonicus is known by two fragmentary mandibles and part of the palate. Compared with other manatees, it has a wide space between the posterior lower tooth row and ascending ramus of dentary, where the buccinator muscle is located, and a wide ascending ramus of the mandible, which covers the posterior end of the tooth row.. It also shares some characteristics with living species, as relatively few large teeth and few mental foramina as T. manatus and T. senegalensis (in contrast with the many smaller teeth and many mental foramina of T. inunguis) and a straight and shallow mandibular symphysis as T. inunguis and T. senegalensis (in contrast with the downturned snout and deep mandibular symphysis of T. manatus). The affinities of this species are still not fully resolved, being recovered in a polytomy with T. inunguis and a clade formed by T. manatus and T. senegalensis  Distribution  The Latin name hesperamazonicus refers to the western localization of the species, hesperos (west) and amazonicus (from the Amazon region). The fossil was found near the village of Araras, in Nova Mamor√©, state of Rondonia, Brazil. The site also yielded pampatheres and a fossil species of tapir. 14C dates from associated wood samples give an age of 44,710 ¬± 880 years before present. At that time, the Madeira River had slow currents and many marginal lakes. At the end of the Pleistocene, changes on the river regime originated several rapids, creating an environment unsuitable to manatees, that are currently absent from the region.

The hotel was built in 1939 on the site of the former Cafe and Hotel Australia, which opened in 1916, and was demolished in 1989. Designed by Leslie M. Perrott, the Hotel Australia was a 12-storey building with 94 rooms, numerous private dining and function rooms, and was the most prestigious hotel in Melbourne in its day. It included an arched-roofed ballroom which was a simplified version of the main Cafe Australia space. The hotel included two small cinemas, a restaurant and bar in the basement, and a through-block shopping arcade on the ground floor which was touted as the largest in Australia, known as the Australia Arcade. The site is now occupied by a Novotel hotel and the shopping arcade St. Collins Lane. History In 1916, Anthony Lucas, the former proprietor of the prominent Paris Cafe, purchased the Vienna Cafe on Collins Street. Lucas employed Walter Burley Griffin to design a foyer, concert hall, and winter garden on the site. The new cafe opened in October 1916. The hotel was sold by Lucas in 1927 for 20,000 pounds to Fred Matear and Norman Carlyon and completely refurbished in the process. In 1937, plans for the new Hotel Australia was announced. Plans for the twelve-story building included an arcade which, when connected with a second arcade, would directly connect Flinders and Bourke streets. The first event held at the new hotel occurred on June 22, 1939, with a benefit gala for St. Vincent's Hospital. During World War II, Douglas MacArthur used two floors of the hotel as his headquarters. The hotel hosted many dignitaries. Sir Robert Menzies enjoyed the hotel dining room while Harold Holt had his wedding reception at the hotel. Demolition The Citistate development group bought the hotel in June 1987 at a price of $55 million. While preservationists wanted to save the structures, Citistate had purchased the building in a vacant state and claimed the building was a fire hazard, and heritage-listed sites held no legal recourse at the time. The hotel was ultimately demolished in the winter of 1989, with the fire marshal declaring the demolition site a fire hazard. The site is now the Novotel Hotel on Collins Street.

ALADS represented 8,200 deputies and district attorney investigators in 2006.  History  ALADS was founded in February 1970 by 10 deputies. In 1976, ALADS was certified to represent Bargaining Unit 0611, composed of sworn officers of Los Angeles County. In 1999, a splinter union, the Los Angeles Sheriff's Professional Association (LASPA), was formed, due to disagreements with ALADS over providing greater public transparency of ALADS documents, including financial statements, employee and attorney contracts, and expense records. In 2009, ALADS partnered with Los Angeles Police Protective League, the LAPD union, to form a political action committee (PAC) called the California Law and Order Independent Expenditure Committee. ALADS also operates a PAC called the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs PAC. In 2014, a power struggle within ALADS over illegitimate power grabs and misuse of union funds led to the splintering of ALADS. Armando Macias, who held the position of ALADS president, was accused of withdrawing $100,000 from the union's PAC.  Leadership  As of 2020, ALADS is led by Ronald Hernandez, President, and James Wheeler, Vice President.  Controversies  ALADS has successfully prevented the Sheriff‚Äôs Department from disclosing information from deputies‚Äô personnel records to the public. The union also took the department to court in 1991 and 2009 to prevent efforts to expedite the administrative review of officer-involved shootings. ALADS sued the department in 2009 to stop a reform that would have allowed investigators to simultaneously pursue administrative reviews and criminal proceedings for officer-involved shootings. In the 2018 election, ALADS spent US$1.32 million supporting the election bid of Alex Villanueva, over incumbent sheriff Jim McDonnell. This was despite Villaneuva's former backing of an ALADS splinter group. In the lead-up to the March 2020 Los Angeles County District Attorney election, LAPPL contributed over to a political action committees in order to defeat George Gasc√≥n, a reform-minded candidate running for the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney. During the election, law enforcement unions, including ALADS, had instead contributed over 75% of the $2.2 million raised by incumbent District Attorney Jackie Lacey. Lacey ultimately won the race, given broad financial support from law enforcement unions.  Finances  ALADS is registered as a 501(c)(5) non-profit organization. In 2017, ALADS had a total revenue of US$11,086,219 and total assets of $33,107,777.

Swamped by international news reporters, after her son's success flying the first solo crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, Evangeline said; ‚ÄúI am grateful. There is no use attempting to find words to express my happiness.‚Äù  Personal life  Born Evangeline Lodge Land in Detroit on 29 May 1876 to newlyweds, married in 1875, Dr. Charles Henry Land (1847-1922) and Evangeline Lodge (1850-1919). In 1899, Evangeline graduated from the University of Michigan and taught chemistry at Little Falls High School. On 27 March 1901, she married Charles August Lindbergh. Evangeline gave birth to son Charles Augustus Lindbergh on 4 Feb 1902. Later that year, they settled into a new house of the river in Little Falls, Minnesota. Charles had established a successful law practice in Little Falls after University of Michigan Law School graduation in 1883. His first wife Mary LaFond died after abdomen surgery in 1898. Charles, a Republican, served as a U.S. Congressman (R-MN-6) from 1907 to 1917. Evangeline often had difficulty raising her two step- daughters, Lillian and Eva, who both eventually moved away. She often threatened Lindbergh with divorce, who caved in to her demands, fearing a divorce would cost him his seat in congress. After further problems, Evangeline began to live in a separate residence in 1909. Her son graduated Little Falls High School on June 5, 1918. Lindbergh 1927, pp. 19‚Äì22.The couple separated in 1918, their only child being the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh, Charles A. An Autobiography of Values, 1976, p.90. In 1920, Evangeline and her son rented rooms at a boarding house in Madison while Charles Jr. attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Lindbergh dropped out in the middle of his sophomore year to fly in Lincoln, Nebraska. Evangeline spent one summer traveling with her son as he barnstormed through the mid west United States. Resuming her career, Evangeline graduated from Columbia University in 1925 with a master's degree in education. Except for teaching in Istanbul, Turkey from 1928-1929, she taught chemistry at the Cass Technical High School in Detroit from 1922 until retirement in 1942. Evangeline visited her son prior to Lindbergh's historic solo transatlantic flight but, to minimize distractions, she left before his takeoff on , 1927 from Roosevelt Field, Long Island. In a June 11th, 1927 photo, Evangeline can be seen over the son's right shoulder as President Calvin Coolidge presents him with the Distinguished Flying Cross after his solo Atlantic flight. The 1930 US Census shows Evangeline living with brother the mechanical engineer Charles H. Land (1881-1961) at 508 Lakepointe, Grosse Pointe Township, Wayne County, Michigan. In 1938 she accompanied her daughter in law and son who, at the request of the United States military, traveled to Germany to evaluate German aviation.Time magazine, January 19, 1939..

The game became available on Steam on September 16, 2016.  Gameplay  The player controlled character plays the role of an NPC, acting as a janitor in a sci-fi themed bazaar. The player character must pick up and incinerate trash, the ability to do so is on a cooldown rate per day, while managing hunger and periodically purchasing \\"gender\\".  Development and plot  Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor was created in light of the Gamergate controversy, where female video game developer Zoe Quinn was repeatedly harassed for non-conventional projects. Developer James Shasha said: > \\"Obviously, [harassment] wasn't new. We all knew it was happening. We were > feeling pretty disenchanted with certain aspects of the community. I think > it's impossible at some level to separate certain cultural things about game > spaces from games themselves. We had a lot of conversations about what > player expectations are, and how we can either subvert, play with, or > outright fuck with their expectations,\\" The player's role as a janitor that never escapes their original routine, the regular abuses of power by the game's police force, and interactions with other NPCs are all intended as metaphors for capitalism. In addition to this, the game contains themes of transgender experience and of mental health. The skull that follows the player immediately after finishing the introduction is a metaphor for depression as well as whatever the player's personal experience with mental illness be. In order to avoid the player's field of view from going hazy, they must regularly purchase \\"gender\\" -- a metaphor for dysphoria.  Reception  The game's themes and narrative were praised for being \\"a reverse-power fantasy\\"; even being compared to Papers, Please and Cart Life, if only \\"with a happier aesthetic\\". Its \\"gender\\" mechanic allowed itself to be placed in the \\"Queer Games Bundle\\" on Steam.

He was the fourth son of five siblings. At the age of five, he started learning the basics of rhythm from his uncle, a Burmese harp artist. At the age of 8 he was able to play and sing by himself. At the age of 10, he had mastered the violin. Growing up with violinists Nyein, U Ba Thwin, and Ko Ba Yee's mastered the violin while still young. He became a violinist by the musical direction of violinist U Ba Latt and Ko Ba Yee. He became proficient in the piano under the musical direction of U Thar Din and became known as pianist Maung Aye in the 1930s. When the tape was first recorded at Columbia Records in 1932, the name \\"Shwe Pyi Aye\\" was assigned by Benjo Ko Nit and Ma Kyi Aung. The piano playing style of Shwe Pyi Aye became innovative. \\"When a film scene disappeared, the music disappeared.\\" As soon as the next film scene continued, the music changed suddenly. At the time no one was better than Shwe Pyi Aye in finding songs that fit the plot. He was a good songwriter and was able to adapt to the story when film companies hired him. Burmese films with sound began to appear in 1932, starting with the film \\"Ngwe Pay Lo Ma Ya\\". But silent films continued to be produced without reduction. Shwe Pyi Aye was a musician for many years as a film music composer both in many silent films and in films with sound. From the era of independence to the late 1960s, Academy pianist Hla Htut wrote that it would not be wrong to call it the \\"Shwe Pyi Aye era\\" of movie songs. Pianist Hla Htut also wrote that more than half of the popular movie songs of the period were the works of Sayar Shwe Pyi Aye. In Mawlamyaing, during the screening of \\"Shwe Hnin Si\\" film, the song \\"Pan Hay Wan\\", was performed by Shwe Pyi Aye playing the music to accompany the vocalist Pyi Ba Shin. The film watchers from the Mawlamyaing Film theater were surprised by this. When Shwe Pyi Aye returned to Yangon he practiced with Ma Aye Mi for the song \\"Pan Hay Won\\" and also co-sang and played music in silent films. He became famous in the music world. He was recorded practicing the song \\" Pan Hay Won\\" with Ma Aye Mi in Columbia Record; the tape was released in July 1935 by the favour of company manager Mr. Katt and the song \\"Pan Hay Won\\" became popular throughout Burma. \\"Pan Hay Won\\", a song of Shwe Pyi Aye and Ma Aye Mi was became well-known music and is still popular in Myanmar today. In 1954, he was awarded the \\"Alinkar Kyawswar\\" title by the state for his portrayal of Burmese culture. One of his musical career highlights was his involvement in the 1963 Burmese drama film, Maung Doe Cherry Myay. Death He died in 22 October 1977.

The action, originally organized within the music industry in response to the killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, took place on June 2, 2020. Businesses taking part were encouraged to abstain from releasing music and other business operations. Some outlets produced blacked out, silent, or minimal programming for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time that police officer Derek Chauvin compressed Floyd's neck.  Background  Blackout Tuesday stemmed off of the original initiative #TheShowMustBePaused created by music executives Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, Senior Director of Marketing at Atlantic Records. Agyemang and Thomas have since noted that \\"These injustices we are facing in America are not limited to just our community. This is a global initiative and our efforts will include members worldwide\\". Businesses participated in different ways. Black Americans were asked to not buy or sell on this day to show economic strength and unity. Spotify announced it would be adding an 8-minute and 46-second moment of silence to certain podcasts and playlists for the day. Apple Music stripped down and took over the \\"Browse\\", \\"For You\\", and \\"Radio\\" tabs and replaced them with a single radio streaming station in celebration of Black music. On Facebook and Instagram, users participated by posting a single photo of a black square alongside the hashtag #blackouttuesday.  Actions promoted  Organizations supporting Blackout Tuesday suggested that the day could be an opportunity for reflection on racism and the effects of racism on society. Others suggested it could be an opportunity to take time from work to focus on helping others. According to the original statement released by Aygyemang and Thomas, \\"This is not just a 24-hour initiative. We are and will be in this fight for the long haul. A plan of action will be announced\\". This is only phase one of a multi-phase movement. It was also proposed that this day be used as ‚Äúa day to disconnect from work and reconnect with our community‚Äù via ‚Äúan urgent step of action to provoke accountability and change.‚Äù \\"Blackout Tuesday\\" was originally conceived as a music-industry protest, according to Rolling Stone, and Jamila Thomas and Brianna Agyemang of Atlantic Records meant it to be a call for the industry to \\"not conduct business as usual.\\" In a statement, Thomas wrote, \\"Your black executives, artists, managers, staff, colleagues are drained, traumatized, hurt, scared, and angry,\\" adding, \\"I don‚Äôt want to sit on your Zoom calls talking about the black artists who are making you so much money, if you fail to address what‚Äôs happening to black people right now.\\" In a separate statement, the pair wrote that \\"the show can‚Äôt just go on, as our people are being hunted and killed.\\"  Concerns and criticisms  Some users posted the black square image using the hashtag #blackouttuesday, #blacklivesmatter or #BLM (an acronym of the former), which in turn leads users who are searching those hashtags to find nothing but solid black images. Some activists were concerned because the Black Lives Matter related hashtags are being used by activists and others to share information during the ongoing protests, and posting a black square with the incorrect hashtag risks drowning out critical information and updates. Other users pointed to those participating in the Blackout Tuesday event, but not involving themselves in other forms of activism, such as protesting or donating, as being performative in their activism. There was also a hoax spreading around claiming that the event was started by 4chan trolls, but research has shown that to be false. Blackout Tuesday was criticized as a form of virtue signalling for the initiative's \\"lack of clarity and direction\\".

Trump held up a Bible and posed for a photo op in front of Ashburton House (the church's parish house), which had been damaged by a fire during protests the night before. The clearing of demonstrators from Lafayette Square was widely condemned as excessive and an affront to the First Amendment right to freedom of assembly. Just before visiting the church, Trump delivered a speech where he urged the governors of U.S. states to quell violent protests by using the National Guard to \\"dominate the streets\\", or he would otherwise \\"deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem\\". Former military leaders, current religious leaders, and elected officials from both parties condemned Trump for the event, though some of Trump's fellow Republicans defended the actions. The event was described by The New York Times as \\"a burst of violence unlike any seen in the shadow of the White House in generations\\" and possibly one of the defining moments of the Trump presidency. Civil liberties groups filed a federal lawsuit against Trump, U.S. Attorney General William Barr, and other federal officials, alleging they violated protesters' constitutional rights. General Mark A. Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, later apologized for his role in the photo op.Helene Cooper (June 11, 2020). \\"Milley Apologizes for Role in Trump Photo Op: 'I Should Not Have Been There'\\". The New York Times. Background On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer, who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for 8minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest. Video of the killing triggered widespread protests and riots across the United States. = \\"Law and order\\" = During his presidential campaign, Trump declared himself \\"the law and order candidate\\", alluding to a political theme popularized in the late 1960s by Richard Nixon and then- Governor Ronald Reagan. He reiterated the theme in his inaugural address: \\"This American carnage stops right here and stops right now\\". Following days of domestic unrest in May, Trump returned to the law-and-order message. On the night of May 28, Trump posted to Twitter, \\"These THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won't let that happen. Just spoke to [Minnesota] Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\\" The tweet was flagged by Twitter for 'glorifying violence'. Trump later said he was not advocating violence, noting that the tweet could be read as either a threat or a statement of fact and that the tweet was \\"spoken as a fact, not as a statement\\". In a later interview, he stated that he intended for the tweet to be read as \\"a combination of both\\". On May 31, Trump tweeted: \\"LAW & ORDER\\". On a morning conference call with U.S. state governors on June 1, Trump said, \\"You have to dominate, if you don't dominate you're wasting your time. They're going to run over you. You're going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.\\" Attorney General Barr added that \\"law enforcement response is not going to work unless we dominate the streets.\\" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on the call, \\"we need to dominate the battlespace. You have deep resources in the guard.\\" Secretary Esper was later criticized for using military terms in relation to civil unrest. A senior Pentagon official recalled that Trump said in a mid-day June 1 meeting, \\"We need to get control of the streets. We need 10,000 troops up here [in Washington]. I want it right now.\\" Invocation of the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty military forces was discussed and favored by Vice President Mike Pence but opposed by Attorney General Bill Barr and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. The act was last invoked in 1992 at California's request in response to the Rodney King riots. It has also been used during the Civil rights movement to enforce school integration and desegregation. In his Rose Garden speech on June 1 just prior to the photo op, Trump declared, \\"I am your president of law and order.\\" =Bunker visit and reactions= On May 29, hundreds of protesters gathered outside the White House. Shortly after 7:00p.m., multiple protesters crossed temporary barricades near the Treasury Department, about 350 feet from the East Wing. The Secret Service placed the White House on lockdown and recommended that Trump and his family move to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, an underground bunker, which they did. Trump spent almost an hour in the bunker. The specific security measure was kept secret until reported by The New York Times on May 31. Media coverage reportedly enraged Trump, who felt it gave the impression he was hiding during the protests. On social media, critics derided Trump as a 'coward' with the moniker \\"Bunker Boy\\". Trump said he was in the bunker \\"for a tiny, little short period of time... much more for an inspection\\" rather than because of any imminent danger. This accounting of events was later contradicted by Attorney General William Barr, who said the May 29 protests \\"were so bad that the Secret Service recommended that the President go down to the bunker\\". Trump's displeasure over the coverage reportedly led to his decision to stage a photo op at St. John's Church. =Ashburton House fire= Police form line in the street during protests in D.C. on the night of May 31 Several fires were set during protests in Washington on the night of May 31, including one set in the basement of Ashburton House, the parish house of St. John's Episcopal Church. The fire was isolated to the church nursery and extinguished by firefighters. According to the church's rector, Reverend Rob Fisher, during the protests \\"a fire was lit in the nursery, in the basement of Ashburton House\\". Fisher wrote that the fire was small, wrecking the nursery room but leaving the rest of the church untouched, except by graffiti which had been quickly fixed. Trump later claimed that \\"the church was badly hurt\\" and retweeted a false claim that the church \\"was firebombed by terrorists\\". = Security perimeter = Following violent protests in D.C., planning began on an expansion of the White House security perimeter. According to U.S. Park Police (USPP) Chief Gregory Monahan, on May 31, the Secret Service confirmed with USPP that anti-scale fencing \\"would be procured and potentially delivered on [June 1] for installation along H Street.\\" Attorney General Barr was appointed to lead the federal response in D.C. Following the overnight demonstrations on May 31 that had damaged St. John's Church and left graffiti on the Treasury Department headquarters, Barr decided to expand the White House's security perimeter. Barr ordered the FBI to deploy its Hostage Rescue Team to the streets by midnight. The federal response resulted in all Homeland Security Investigations agents in the area being told just before noon on June1 to prepare to assist with handling protests. All the federal officers newly stationed to D.C. had volunteered for the opportunity, said the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. Graffiti on the exterior of the Treasury Department (June5) Although the decision to extend the perimeter had been made that morning, it had not been carried out by the afternoon of June 1, surprising Barr, who had entered Lafayette Square to check on conditions. He then ordered the perimeter expanded. A member of the D.C. National Guard reported he had personally informed Barr that the crowd was peaceful. Officers began clearing the area around 6:30 pm; the previously announced city curfew would not go into effect until 7 pm. = Photo op preparations = According to The New York Times, on the morning of June 1, Trump was advised that allowing protesters and unrest on the streets of the capital was not symbolically acceptable. A team consisting of the president's daughter Ivanka Trump, her husband and Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, and Counselor to the President Hope Hicks, reportedly devised a plan for President Trump to walk to St. John's Church, though several administration officials credited President Trump himself with the idea.

The announcement is largely unintelligible even to protesters at the front of the crowd. *6:26 p.m.: D.C. Police radio announces that police action is about to take place and that D.C. Police are to hold their positions on 16th Street. *6:28 p.m.: Park Police notify Arlington County Police via radio that \\"level one's been activated\\", referring to a policing tactic to quell violent unrest by charging crowds to disperse them without making physical contact. Police and National Guard military police, wearing gas masks and riot gear advance to the barricade on the North side of Lafayette Park. At least one protester throws water bottles and is reprimanded by another protester. The Secret Service and Park Police begin to push protesters at the northeast corner of the park up Vermont Avenue as Park Police mounted on horses appear behind them. *6:32 p.m.: Arlington Police radio says, \\"Moving forward to the intersection, forward to the intersection. Go, go, go,\\" in reference to the largest group of protesters on H Street. The protesters retreat, evacuating H Street between 16th Street NW and Vermont Ave in front of the advancing security forces. Police with riot shields enter the patio of St. John's Episcopal Church and physically push out a group of clergy and volunteers, leaving the police in control of the front of St John's Church. *6:34 p.m.: Arlington Police radio says, \\"We're gonna take 16th Street on this next surge.\\" *6:35 p.m.: Park police on H Street rush the protesters at the intersection of H Street and 16th Street. A chemical grenade is rolled at the feet of protesters. *6:36 p.m.: Park police push protesters west on H Street past 16th Street. Video records several members of the Park Police SWAT team and the Bureau of Prisons Special Operations Response Team firing pepper balls at the fleeing crowd. The Washington Post reported that a member of the Park Police SWAT team threw a stingball grenade containing rubber pellets into the crowd. *6:39 p.m.: A Park Police SWAT officer crouches down to roll a chemical grenade into the crowd. *6:42 p.m.: Arlington Police radio says, \\"We are going all the way to I Street.

Clearing Lafayette Square and St. John's Minutes before a speech by Trump in the White House Rose Garden, hundreds of officers in riot gear rapidly advanced on the protesters at the direction of Attorney General William Barr. Officers used chemical irritants (including tear gas and pepper balls), sting ball grenades, flash grenades, smoke canisters, rubber bullets, riot shields, and batons to disperse the crowd. By 6:30p.m., police were pushing people off the patio of St. John's Church. Police on foot and mounted police on horses began moving the crowd west down H towards Connecticut Avenue by 6:35 p.m. Dispersing protesters ahead of President Trump's visit to St. John's Church (in Spanish) A number of law enforcement agencies were involved, including the U.S. Park Police (USPP), U.S. Secret Service, D.C. National Guard, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Arlington County Police Department, U.S. Marshals, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). National Guard members were present but did not participate in clearing protesters. U.S. Park Police issued a statement claiming that \\"At approximately 6:33p.m., violent protestors on H Street NW began throwing projectiles including bricks, frozen water bottles, and caustic liquids.\\" However, a Washington Post review of videos taken at the scene failed to find evidence of these items being thrown. Some protesters threw eggs, candy, and water bottles at the line of police. Journalists who were on the scene also reported that the demonstration was peaceful. Jonathan Allen of NBC News wrote: \\"no one was threatening the police. It was an entirely peaceful protest, the kind that occurs in Washington without incident, seemingly every day.\\" A CNN team recorded no projectiles thrown at police, reporting that, as police began to clear the square, \\"demonstrators were hit by projectiles and began to cough and choke.\\" Garrett Haake of NBC News wrote, \\"there was no object-throwing before the mounted park police moved in.\\" During a live report for the Australian morning show Sunrise, journalist Amelia Brace and cameraman Timothy Myers were assaulted by a charging police line. Brace was clubbed with a police baton and Myers was hit in the chest with the edge of a riot shield and then punched, as they covered protests near the White House. Brace said she and Myers were also shot by rubber bullets. Brace said at the time: \\"You heard us yelling there that we were media but they don't care, they are being indiscriminate at the moment.\\" In response, the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Australia would launch an investigation into the incident. Reverend Gini Gerbasi, the rector of nearby St. John's Episcopal Church, Georgetown, said that despite some tense moments the crowd was calm and peaceful until the police advanced. She had helped organize more than twenty priests and lay volunteers to provide water, food, and hand sanitizer as a \\"peaceful presence in support of protesters\\". They were packing up before the 7:00p.m. curfew when armed riot police entered the churchyard and expelled them. Gerbasi found herself coughing from tear gas, while other people around her were hit with non-lethal projectiles, and they were forced from the churchyard by police carrying riot shields. White House speech While law enforcement continued to clear protesters from nearby streets and with smoke still drifting in the air, Trump emerged to give a speech in the White House Rose Garden, where he said, \\"I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters.\\" Law enforcement munitions could be heard in the background during the speech. Some news networks showed the speech in a split screen described as \\"surreal\\". Regarding violent protests in the United States, Trump urged state governors to use the National Guard \\"in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets\\". If cities or states fail to respond adequately, he said he would \\"deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them\\". Regarding D.C., Trump stated, \\"As we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults, and the wanton destruction of property.\\" Trump concluded his speech by saying: \\"Now I am going to pay my respects to a very, very special place.\\" Participants 250px Flanked by Secret Service agents, the president walked with a group of senior officials and advisors from the White House complex to St. John's Church. The group included: *William Barr, *Pat Cipollone, *Mark Esper, *Alyssa Farah, *Hope Hicks, *Keith Kellogg, *Jared Kushner, *Nick Luna, *Derek Lyons, *Kayleigh McEnany, *Mark Meadows, *Stephen Miller, *Mark Milley, *Robert O'Brien, *Tony Ornato, *Dan Scavino, *Ivanka Trump, Appearance at the church President Trump at the door of Ashburton House, St. John's Church Parish House, June1 Following a five-minute walk from the White House, Trump arrived at St. John's Church at 7:06p.m. His daughter, Ivanka, handed him a Bible which she carried there in her handbag. He turned it over, and held it aloft as he stood in front of Ashburton House beside the church noticeboard. A reporter asked \\"Is that your Bible?\\" and Trump replied, \\"It's a Bible.\\" Trump made no formal remarks. When asked if he had any thoughts, Trump said, \\"We have a great country. That's my thoughts. Greatest country in the world. We will make it greater. We will make it even greater. It won't take long. It's not going to take long. You see what's going on. You see it coming back.\\" Trump first posed alone with the Bible, while standing in front of the church's noticeboard, which stated: \\"All are welcome\\". He then spent \\"several minutes posing for photos alone and with other officials\\", including Barr, O'Brien, Meadows, Esper, and McEnany. The New York Times reported that Trump \\"made no pretense of any intent other than posing for photographs‚Äîhe held up the Bible carried by his daughter, then gathered a few top advisers next to him in a line\\". The entire group then departed the church grounds at 7:11p.m. and returned to the White House at 7:18p.m. Trump did not enter the church during this appearance. It was his third visit to the church since being elected president. Aftermath and subsequent eventsActive- duty military= In his June 1 speech, Trump encouraged governors to use the National Guard in sufficient numbers to \\"dominate the streets\\" and promised to \\"deploy the military\\" if necessary to restore order. On June 1 and 2, about 1,700 active-duty U.S. military troops from Fort Bragg, Fort Drum, and Fort Riley were positioned at military installations in the capital area including Fort Belvoir and Fort Myer in Virginia and Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. No active-duty forces were deployed inside Washington, D.C. At a Pentagon press conference on June 3, Defense Secretary Mark Esper declared his opposition to using active-duty military to quell domestic unrest: \\"The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.\\" Esper faced criticism earlier in the week for using the term \\"dominate the battlespace\\" in reference to how National Guard resources could be used. On June 3, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy ordered the return of some active duty troops to their home bases. The order was overturned by Esper after a White House meeting later that day. But the following day, Esper ordered the move to proceed and 700 troops from the 82nd Airborne were sent back to North Carolina. By June 5, the Pentagon had ordered all active-duty military to return to their home bases. The active duty troops stationed in the capital area complemented roughly 5,400 guardsmen from D.C. and 11 other states, including Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Maryland, Missouri, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Utah. Governors of Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware declined requests to send National Guard troops from their states to the District of Columbia. =Tear gas use and denial= Police cordon extended north along 16th St NW past the church, June 3\\\\. Numerous eyewitness accounts and news reporters indicated that tear gas was used to disperse protesters in Lafayette Square. WUSA9 reporters on scene \\"witnessed canisters venting out green-colored gas\\" and then collected several spent canisters. According to WUSA9, the canisters \\"were not from a previous day\\", because they \\"were in the middle of the street undisturbed, and in one case, still slightly warm to the touch\\", and also because the WUSA9 journalists were the first people on the scene \\"immediately after\\" the police departed. The canisters were labelled SPEDE-HEAT CS and SKAT SHELL OC. WUSA9 reporters also recovered a fragment of a Stinger OC Grenade, which releases OC gas and blasts rubber pellets out . OC is short for oleoresin capsicum, a chemical irritant found in peppers, which activates the TRPV1 pain receptor and produces tears in humans. CS gas, which is commonly known as tear gas, activates the TRPA1 receptor and is more toxic than OC, but similarly it also produces tears in humans. A video of the event shows at least one law enforcement officer with an OC canister strapped to his vest. Video of the officers' advance shows a law enforcement officer throwing at protesters an object that The Washington Post identified as a sting-ball grenade. Despite this evidence, U.S. Park Police officials said, \\"USPP officers and other assisting law enforcement partners did not use tear gas or OC Skat Shells to close the area at Lafayette Park\\", adding that they only used \\"pepper balls\\" and \\"smoke canisters\\". But in a June 5 interview, U.S. Park Police spokesperson Sgt. Eduardo Delgado called it a \\"mistake\\" to insist \\"tear gas\\" was not used, as the pepper balls used by Park Police would also cause tears. Delgado said the initial decision to deny that \\"tear gas\\" was used was due to Park Police assuming \\"people would think [of] CS or CN\\", which are two common examples of tear gas. In sworn Congressional testimony on July 28, Monohan reiterated that CS gas was not used but when asked about the use of other \\"chemical agents\\", Monohan noted the USPP's use of sting ball grenades, which can contain chemical irritants. One such grenade containing OC gas was recovered at the scene. Attorney General William Barr and officials with several law enforcement agencies also denied using tear gas. In an interview with CBS News, Barr reiterated \\"there was no tear gas used\\" on June 1. \\"The tear gas was used Sunday [May 31] when they had to clear H Street to allow the fire department to come in to save St. John's Church. That's when tear gas was used.\\" Donald Trump's presidential campaign demanded news outlets retract reports of \\"tear gas\\" use. Trump called the reports \\"fake\\" and said \\"they didn't use tear gas.\\" Fact checkers from the Associated Press, CNN, FactCheck.org, and Politifact have reported on this issue. The specific compound which the Park Police denied using is CS, a traditional tear gas. \\"Tear gas\\", however, is a broad term for a group of chemicals known for being riot control agents, e.g. PAVA in the pepper balls that USPP acknowledge using. The sources for this broad definition are the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Scientific American, and the Handbook of Toxicology of Chemical Warfare Agents. Thus the fact checkers reported that the difference between pepper spray and traditional tear gas compounds is only semantics, because the practical effect is the same: chemically irritated eyes, throats, and other areas. On June 13, U.S. Secret Service officials issued a correction stating that one employee had used OC spray \\"in response to an assaultive individual\\". It is unclear whether this referred to a handheld aerosolized spray or a thrown canister. =Australian response to attack on Australian journalists= While dispersing demonstrators, the police attacked a news crew from Network Seven, a major Australian media outlet. Cameraman Timothy Myers was hit with a riot shield and punched by police, while a different officer attempted to attack reporter Amelia Brace with a baton as she fled. Both Myers and Brace were also shot with rubber bullets and attacked with tear gas. The police actions were criticized by both Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese. Morrison said the event was \\"troubling\\" and directed the Australian Embassy to investigate and to express \\"strong concerns\\" to U.S. authorities. The Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents Australian journalists, submitted a letter to the U.S. Ambassador to Australia protesting the attack. A Network Seven spokesman said the attack against Myers and Brace was \\"nothing short of wanton thuggery\\". U.S. Park Police officials said two officers had been assigned to administrative duties pending investigation of the attack. =Helicopters and subsequent investigation= Pentagon officials directed National Guard helicopters to use a \\"persistent presence\\" to disperse protesters. Helicopters, including a twin-engine UH-60 Black Hawk and UH-72 Lakota, were observed in a \\"low-flying show of force\\" over protesters who had again gathered later in the evening. Experts said that the maneuvers presented risks to the pilots, the crew, and persons on the ground, including rotor wash that sends debris flying. The Washington Post reported that \\"one helicopter buzzed protesters from a height nearly level with three- and four-story buildings in the Chinatown area, ripping tree limbs away [and the] rotor wash hurled glass from broken windows like shrapnel.\\" The use of a helicopter with Red Cross markings for a law enforcement action was also criticized. Misuse of the Red Cross symbol is prohibited by the First Geneva Convention. On June 2, the commander of the District of Columbia National Guard announced an investigation into the use of the medevac helicopter. The crew of the UH-72 has been grounded during the investigation. =Subsequent demonstrations= Tall fences around Lafayette Square with burned bathroom in background, June 2 After the expulsion of demonstrators from Lafayette Square, tall fences were erected overnight at the edge of the square, where demonstrators returned the next day, expressing anger at what had occurred. A crowd of demonstrators triple the size of the previous day peacefully demonstrated. By the afternoon of June 3, protesters \\"found themselves pushed almost a full street farther back from the White House\\" with two large military vehicles across 16th Street NW entirely blocking Lafayette Square and rows of officers with riot gear and crowd-control munitions stationed in front of the vehicles. On June 11, temporary fencing around Lafayette Park was dismantled and the park reopened. =Lawsuits= Observers raised concerns that the police action violated rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reads, \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\" Three days after protesters were forcibly removed from Lafayette Square, a group of protesters and Black Lives Matter D.C., represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, filed a federal lawsuit against Trump and Barr, claiming they conspired to violate, and did violate, their constitutional rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Other officials, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Secret Service Director James M. Murray, were also named as defendants. A second lawsuit was filed by three protesters on June 11 against law enforcement and Trump administration officials asserting that June1 events represented a \\"gross abuse of executive power\\" that violated their First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. = Congressional hearings = Congress is investigating the tactics used in clearing of the park. The first hearing was held before the House Natural Resources Committee on June 30 included testimony from a protester, journalist, church leader, and a law professor. No Trump administration officials were called to testify and the U.S. Park Police declined an invitation to testify. Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School noted in his testimony that the Park Police had argued they were creating a perimeter to establish a new fence line on H Street but protesters were pushed back to I Street, \\"which is beyond the fence line\\". He notes this \\"would warrant congressional review ... of how far those protesters were pushed back and why\\". The U.S. Park Police stated on July 7 that \\"the radio recorder was not working and did not record any transmissions\\" during the June 1 sweep of protesters, meaning that there is no audio record of Park Police communication. Rep. Ra√∫l Grijalva, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, stated, \\"For the official audio record of that day to now turn up missing has every appearance of a coverup.\\" On July 9, the House Armed Services Committee held a hearing into Department of Defense involvement in domestic law enforcement. Esper testified that it was \\"still unclear\\" who gave the order to clear D.C. protesters. Notably, he stated, \\"National Guard personnel were not engaged in clearing protesters in Lafayette Square\\". Guard forces on the ground \\"did not advance on the crowd\\" but rather \\"maintained a static role\\". Esper explained that the Guard had lent riot gear, including shields labeled \\"MILITARY POLICE\\", to other agencies. The House Natural Resources Committee held its second hearing on July 28. Gregory T. Monahan, Acting Chief of the U.S. Park Police, testified that USPP officers \\"acted with tremendous restraint in the face of severe violence\\" and that the decision to clear the park was entirely unrelated to the President's planned visit. Adam D. DeMarco, Major, D.C. National Guard testified that law enforcement used excessive force when clearing protesters from Lafayette Square and described the use of force as \\"an unnecessary escalation\\" and the events as \\"deeply disturbing\\". \\"From what I could observe, the demonstrators were behaving peacefully, exercising their First Amendment rights.\\" DeMarco had not expected that Lafayette Square would be cleared prior to the 7:00 p.m. curfew and that he had been told tear gas would not be used but recognized its use. In his written response to the committee's follow-up questions, DeMarco said the Department of Defense's lead military police officer for the District of Columbia region had sought to use an Active Denial System or \\"heat ray\\", or a Long Range Acoustic Device, to clear the protesters from Lafayette Square, but was informed that the National Guard possessed neither device. = Investigations by Inspectors General = On June 22, the Office of Inspector General (OIG) for the U.S. Department of the Interior launched an investigation into June 1 events following requests from several lawmakers. In a letter to lawmakers, Inspector General Mark Greenblatt wrote, \\"Given the significance of the events, we have already begun collecting and reviewing information concerning the Park Police's activities.\\" On July 23, Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice Inspector General, announced that he was investigating the role of the Department of Justice and its law enforcement personnel in responding to protests in Washington during the previous two months, \\"examining the training and instruction that was provided to the DOJ law enforcement personnel; compliance with applicable identification requirements, rules of engagement, and legal authorities; and adherence to DOJ policies regarding the use of less-lethal munitions, chemical agents, and other uses of force.‚Äù He added that he would coordinate with Inspector General Greenblatt's office on the Lafayette Square investigation. ResponseWhite House and Trump administration= Video released by the White House hours after the photo op Within hours of the visit, the White House released a video of the event set to upbeat orchestral music, showing Trump walking to the church, standing in front of the church with a Bible, and pumping his fist while walking past a row of riot police. The video shows almost no sign of destruction caused by days of protests near the White House. Photos of Trump during this event, including those of him walking across Lafayette Square, were quickly distributed and displayed by Trump's re-election campaign. The Trump administration gave conflicting explanations for the forcible removal of the demonstrators from the park. The White House asserted that the crowd was dispersed to help enforce the 7:00p.m. curfew, but neither Mayor Bowser nor the D.C. police force ever requested such assistance and demonstrators were forced out before curfew. Other Trump administration officials said the move to remove demonstrators was part of a previously planned decision by Barr and others to extend the perimeter around Lafayette Square by a block. White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany compared Trump's photo opportunity to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's review of World War II bombing damage in 1941, saying it was \\"a message of resilience and determination\\". Several days later, she said: \\"There's no regrets on the part of this White House... many of those decisions were not made here within the White House. It was AG Barr who made the decision to move the perimeter. Monday night Park Police had also made that decision independently when they saw all the violence in Lafayette Square.\\" Trump crossing Pennsylvania Avenue through a cordon of riot police after departing St. John's Episcopal Church Deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere said, \\"Protesters were given three warnings by the U.S. Park Police.\\" However, \\"reporters who were on the scene and protesters said they could not make out any audible warnings.\\" Responding to criticisms, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said, \\"Is it a photo op because a photo was taken?... I think the words photo op itself, calling into question, you're looking into someone's heart and wondering, and second-guessing why they would go over there.\\" Axios quoted a senior White House official as saying \\"I've never been more ashamed. I'm really honestly disgusted. I'm sick to my stomach. And they're all celebrating it. They're very very proud of themselves.\\" Donald Trump On June 2, Trump tweeted, \\"D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!)\\". Later that day, he asserted that the same protesters who had been dispersed had set fire to the church. Two days later, Trump shared a letter on Twitter from his former attorney, John M. Dowd, apparently directed to James Mattis in the wake of his sharp criticism of Trump, calling the peaceful demonstrators who were forcibly removed from Lafayette Park \\"terrorists\\". Speaking of his St. John's Church appearance in an interview with Fox News Channel, Trump said, \\"most religious leaders loved it. And why wouldn't they love it? I'm standing in front of a church that went through trauma. [...] It's only the other side that didn't like it.\\" However, only a small minority of church leaders expressed approval while many more sharply criticized his performance. In a second Fox News interview days later, Trump said, \\"I think it was a beautiful picture... And I'll tell you, I think Christians think it was a beautiful picture.\\" On June 11, Trump continued to praise law enforcement's handling of protesters and anarchists, tweeting, \\"Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. 'A walk in the park', one said. The protesters, agitators, anarchists (ANTIFA), and others, were handled VERY easily by the Guard, D.C. Police, & S.S. GREAT JOB\\". Trump said in a Wall Street Journal interview on June 18, that he could not enter because of \\"insurance reasons\\". However, Reverend Mariann Budde, who was overseeing the church at the time, refuted this claim stating \\"there were no insurance reasons why he couldn't go in\\" given that the damage was isolated to the church nursery. William Barr A Department of Justice spokeswoman said Attorney General William Barr had been appointed by Trump to lead \\"efforts to assist in the restoration of order to the District of Columbia\\". In an interview with the Associated Press on June 5, Barr said the decision to expand the security perimeter was reached in a meeting he attended with law enforcement officials at approximately 2:00 p.m. on June 1, and the perimeter was to have been expanded immediately after the meeting. However, because the perimeter had not been expanded when Barr arrived at Lafayette Square later that afternoon, he \\"was frustrated\\" and \\"worried that as the crowd grew, it was going to be harder and harder to do.\\" Barr later distanced himself from the controversial move, saying that earlier on Monday he had ordered the security perimeter extended, and that upon seeing protesters still there in the afternoon he urged \\"get it done\\" but did not give the \\"tactical command\\" how to do it. Video shows him conferring with officials on the ground about 24 minutes before the police launched their push. Barr also said he was not \\"involved in giving tactical commands like that\\", the order to clear the protesters was given by a Park Police official whom he never spoke to, and it was already in progress when he arrived: \\"They had the Park Police mounted unit ready, so it was just a matter of execution. So, I didn't just say to them, 'Go.'\\" On June 7, Attorney General William Barr reacted to the incident by falsely claiming the pepper balls used by law enforcement on protesters were not chemical irritants. Pepper balls contain pelargonic acid vanillylamide; both the product's manufacturer and the Justice Department consider pepper balls a chemical irritant. In a Fox News interview on June 8, Barr was asked three times if he would do anything differently in retrospect. Barr replied \\"no\\". He explained that the actions were taken in response to days of violent protests, including he himself being targeted by protester-thrown projectiles such as \\"rocks and bottles\\" during his visit to the park. Barr challenged the notion that expanding the security perimeter was associated with the photo op, calling it \\"totally false\\" and a \\"canard\\". =Local government officials= Painting \\"BLACK LIVES MATTER\\" on 16th St NW in front of St. John's on June5 Black Lives Matter Plaza street sign in front of church, June6 District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser called the use of force \\"shameful\\" and released a statement through the office's Twitter account that \\"I imposed a curfew at 7:00p.m. A full 25 minutes before the curfew & w/o provocation, federal police used munitions on peaceful protesters in front of the White House.\\" Bowser also said this event will cause D.C. police to have more difficult jobs from then on. In a statement, D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine said the district was \\"now reckoning with an unhinged president responding to nonviolent demonstration with war-like tactics\\". Racine referred to Trump's actions as that of a \\"tyrannical president\\", saying: \\"The entire country watched as Donald Trump ordered federal law enforcement and military police to assault peaceful protesters and clergy exercising their constitutional rights‚Äîunconscionably, for a photo opportunity.\\" Hours after police were used to clear Lafayette Square, neighboring Arlington County ordered its officers in D.C. (where they were supplied as part of a mutual aid agreement) to immediately withdraw; all Arlington County Police Department had left D.C. by 8:30p.m. Arlington County Board Chair Libby Garvey said she was \\"appalled\\" that the agreement was abused \\"for a photo op\\". In a statement the next day, the Board said \\"This unprecedented decision by the County was a necessary response to an unprecedented situation\\" and said its action was to ensure its officers were \\"never again put in a situation where they are asked to take action that is inconsistent with our values\\". On June 5, four days after the clearing of the square, Mayor Bowser oversaw renaming the intersection in front of St. John's Episcopal Church, the corner of 16th Street NW and H Street NW, to Black Lives Matter Plaza. A street sign was installed marking the new name, and the D.C. Department of Public Works, as well as artists with MuralsDC and volunteers, painted \\"BLACK LIVES MATTER\\" in large, capital, block letters stretching from Lafayette Square north for two blocks. Bowser's chief of staff John Falcicchio said, \\"There was a dispute this week about whose street this is... Mayor Bowser wanted to make it abundantly clear that this is DC's street and to honor demonstrators who (were) peacefully protesting on Monday evening.\\" =Religious leadership= The Right Reverend Mariann Budde, the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington who oversees St. John's Church, decried how Trump \\"used violent means to ask to be escorted across the park into the courtyard of the church... He did not pray... He did not seek to unify the country, but rather he used our symbols and our sacred space as a way to reinforce a message that is antithetical to everything that the person of Jesus, whom we follow, and the gospel texts that we strive to emulate... represent.\\" She said the President had used the church as a backdrop and the Bible as a prop, adding \\"I am outraged that he felt he had the licence to do that, and that he would abuse our sacred symbols and our sacred space in that way,\\" adding that he had not told her he intended to visit. The Most Reverend Michael Curry, the presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church (United States), said Trump was using \\"a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes\\". St. John's Church, June 2 Describing the incident, Pastor Rector Gini Gerbasi of St. John's Episcopal Church, Georgetown said, \\"We were literally driven off of the St. John's, Lafayette Square patio with tear gas and concussion grenades and police in full riot gear... We were pushed back 20 feet.\\" Gerbasi said Trump had transformed the church from a \\"holy ground\\" to a \\"battle ground\\", as well as making a \\"cheap political stunt\\". Gregory Brewer, Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Central Florida, tweeted, \\"I am shaken watching protesters in Lafayette Park gassed and cleared so that the President of the United States can do a photo... This is blasphemy in real time.\\" Nine Episcopal bishops from New England released a joint statement decrying Trump's actions as \\"disgraceful and morally repugnant\\". They criticized him for trying to use \\"an unopened Bible\\" to \\"claim Christian endorsement and imply that of The Episcopal Church\\". Worse, they wrote, he appeared to be using the \\"authority\\" of God \\"to support his own authority and to wield enhanced use of military force in a perverted attempt to restore peace to our nation\\". The Reverend Robert Fisher, the rector of St. John's Church, wrote a letter in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and shared a photo of a new sign displayed in front of the church reading: \\"BLACK LIVES MATTER... Do Justice. Love Kindness. Walk humbly with your God. (Micah 6:8)\\". Rabbi Jack Moline, president of the Interfaith Alliance, called the event \\"one of the most flagrant misuses of religion I have ever seen\\", which demonstrates Trump's \\"complete lack of compassion for black Americans and the lethal consequences of racism\\". Jesuit priest and author James Martin declared that Trump's actions are \\"pretty much the opposite of all Jesus stood for\\" and said: \\"Religion is not a political tool. And God is not a plaything.\\" Bishop Elizabeth Eaton, leader of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, called Trump's actions \\"manipulative\\" and even described it as \\"desecration\\". Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, said the Bible \\"is the word of the living God and should be treated with reverence and awe\\". He said he was \\"brokenhearted and alarmed\\" both by Floyd's death and by Trump's response. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, Wilton Daniel Gregory, criticized Trump's use of religious landmarks. Prior to Trump's June 2 visit to Saint John Paul II National Shrine, Gregory said that the planned visit was \\"baffling\\" and \\"reprehensible\\"; the shrine would be \\"egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles\\"; and that Pope John Paul II \\"certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace\\". Megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress defended Trump' actions as \\"completely appropriate\\", claiming Trump's display of the Bible showed that \\"God also hates lawlessness\\". Franklin Graham, a prominent evangelical supporter of Trump, thanked Trump for having \\"made a statement\\". Delivering the eulogy at George Floyd's memorial service in Houston, Texas, Baptist minister and civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton said, \\"You take rubber bullets and teargas to clear out peaceful protesters, and then take a Bible and walk in front of a church, and use a church as a prop. Wickedness in high places.\\" Reverend Rob Schenck pointed out that it was odd for Trump to choose St. John's Church as the church to do a photo op at, considering the church was liberal and supported tenets normally opposed by conservative religious officials such as abortion rights and same-sex marriage. The Bible held by Trump was the Revised Standard Version, and Schenk said this translation \\"would be pretty much rejected by the vast majority of evangelicals\\" including a committed part of Trump's support base. =Current and former officials=Democrats Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic Party nominee in the 2020 United States presidential election said, \\"The president held up the Bible at St John's Church yesterday. I just wish he opened it once in a while... In addition to the Bible, he might also want to open the U.S. Constitution. If he did, he'd find the First Amendment.\\" Following the event, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement, reading in part, \\"at a time when our country cries out for unification, this President is ripping it apart. Tear-gassing peaceful protesters without provocation just so that the President could pose for photos outside a church dishonors every value that faith teaches us.\\" A number of Democratic senators \\"used words like 'fascist' and 'dictator' to describe the president's words and actions\\". Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) called for Barr to resign over the order to extend the White House security perimeter during peaceful protests. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), an Iraq War veteran, said that Trump's use of the military to disperse the protesters was \\"tin-pot dictatorial\\" which \\"sickened her to the core\\".https://www.oneillinois.com/stories/2020/6/3/duckworth-blisters-trump Representative Adam Smith (D-WA), chair of the House Armed Services Committee, criticized General Mark Milley for amplifying the rhetoric of Trump and Esper: \\"The optics of him being in uniform out there might not have been so bad if we didn't have the president out there talking about going to war with the country and using the military and using overwhelming force and Secretary Esper talking about the need to occupy the battlespace.\\" Terry McAuliffe, who was governor of Virginia when Trump declared that there were \\"very fine people on both sides\\" of the 2017 Unite the Right rally, stated, \\"Charlottesville and the Bible incident are the two biggest moral failures of this president.\\" Republicans H Street NW, between St. John's Church and Lafayette Square, on the night of May30 Some of Trump's fellow Republicans defended the clearing of protesters and subsequent photo op at the church, while others decried it. Senator John Cornyn told CNN the protesters had to be cleared out \\"for security purposes\\" since Trump was \\"walking over to the church\\" and dispersing them \\"was a necessary security measure\\". Senator Chuck Grassley defended the clearing of the protesters, stating, \\"It's all assumed to be peaceful until someone that's got a terrorist activity or a rioting activity, you don't know that until it happens. So I don't know if they could have known that.\\" Senator Marco Rubio also defended Trump, tweeting that professional agitators knew the street needed to be cleared before curfew but deliberately stayed to trigger police action and get the story they wanted, that \\"police attacked peaceful protestors\\". By contrast, Senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican senator, objected to using tear gas \\"so the president can go have a photo op\\"; Senator Susan Collins said Trump \\"came across as unsympathetic\\" and \\"insensitive\\" and peaceful protesters were tear gassed \\"in order for the president to go across the street to a church...\\" Senator Ben Sasse voiced his opposition to \\"clearing out a peaceful protest for a photo op that treats the Word of God as a political prop\\". Senator James Lankford criticized the timing of the president's visit for being before the 7:00 p.m. curfew, as \\"everyone knew there were going to be protesters in that area\\" at that time. Senator Lisa Murkowski said, \\"I did not think that what we saw last night was the America I know.\\" Former Justice Department officials A group of 1,260 former U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) prosecutors and other officials issued an open letter on June 11, asking Michael E. Horowitz, the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, to investigate Attorney General William Barr over his role in the use of chemical agents and rubber bullets to halt a peaceful demonstration. The former officials (who included former career DOJ civil servants, former DOJ political appointees, and retired judges), wrote: \\"If the Attorney General or any other DOJ employee has directly participated in actions that have deprived Americans of their constitutional rights or that physically injured Americans lawfully exercising their rights, that would be misconduct of the utmost seriousness, the details of which must be shared with the American people.\\"John Kruzel (June 10, 2020). 1,200 \\"DOJ alumni call for probe of Barr's role in crowd clearing outside White House\\". The Hill.\\"DOJ Alumni Letter to Inspector General Michael Horowitz\\". Medium. June 10, 2020. =Current and former military officers and officials=Esper Secretary Esper at Pentagon news conference, June3 Trump was accompanied on his walk and photo opportunity by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, prompting criticism of both men. An anonymous senior defense official said neither had intended to participate, and in a subsequent interview with NBC, Esper said he believed the walk was to review the troops and was not aware a peaceful protest had just been dispersed. At a news conference on June 3, Esper revised his account, saying, \\"I did know that we were going to the church; I was not aware that a photo op was happening.\\" Esper did not directly answer a question from the press about whether he regretted participating in the photo-op, saying that he tried to stay apolitical but \\"Sometimes, I'm successful, and sometimes I'm not as successful.\\" Esper also said he was not aware of the plan to clear the park and criticized the use of a helicopter. On June 3, Esper sought to send home a small portion of the 1,600 active-duty troops called to Washington, but during an angry meeting, Trump ordered Esper not to do so. The following day, amid a contentious dispute between the Pentagon and the White House, some National Guard troops began to withdraw. Regarding the use of active-duty military, Esper said \\"The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.\\" Esper directed the Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy to lead an after action review of the National Guard's role in domestic law enforcement. The review was expected to be completed by July 30. Milley President Trump leaves the White House grounds accompanied by senior officials, including General Mark A. Milley (right) in combat uniform. In the days after the photo op, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley‚Äîwho had accompanied Trump under the belief that he intended to review troops outside Lafayette Square‚Äîexpressed anger to Trump over what had occurred. On June 1, Milley and Trump had a \\"heated discussion in the Oval Office over whether to send active-duty troops into the streets\\"‚Äîa demand by Trump that Milley strongly opposed. Milley publicly said he opposed invocation of the Insurrection Act and issued a memorandum on June2 to the heads of each branch, reminding them \\"[the Constitution] gives Americans the right to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly\\" and of each member's sworn oath to \\"remain committed to our national values and principles embedded in the Constitution\\". On June 11, in a recorded commencement address to the National Defense University (his first public comments since the event), Milley apologized for his role in Trump photo-op, saying, \\"I should not have been there. My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.... As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from.\\" Mattis Retired Marine Corps general Jim Mattis, who served as Trump's first Secretary of Defense until his resignation in 2018, denounced Trump as a threat to the Constitution. In a statement published in The Atlantic, Mattis wrote that he had witnessed \\"this week's unfolding events, angry and appalled\\" and said he never believed U.S. forces \\"would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens‚Äîmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside\\". Mattis described Trump as \\"the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people‚Äîdoes not even pretend to try\\" and wrote: \\"We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Square. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution.\\" Trump responded to Mattis by calling him \\"the world's most overrated General\\". John Kelly, former White House Chief of Staff and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security under Trump, said he agreed with Mattis's criticism of Trump: \\"I agree with him. I think we need to step back from the politics... the separation of powers is very, very, very important. No president ever is a dictator or a king.\\" Former military National Guard troops on streets of D.C., June3 Former military leaders condemned Trump over his response to protests and the order to clear demonstrators from Lafayette Square. A letter signed by a bipartisan group of 89 former Defense officials, including four former Secretaries of Defense, was published in The Washington Post. The officials objected to Trump's proposal of deploying the military, declaring that American troops \\"signed up to fight our nation's enemies and to secure‚Äînot infringe upon‚Äîthe rights and freedoms of their fellow Americans\\". Retired four-star general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey wrote, \\"America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy.\\" Mick Mulroy, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Trump administration, echoed Dempsey: \\"Active Army and Marine Corps units are trained to fight our nation's enemies, not their fellow Americans. American cities are not battlefields.\\" Mike Mullen, a retired Navy admiral and a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, criticized Trump for having \\"risked further politicizing the men and women of our armed forces\\" and urged Americans not to forget \\"the larger and deeper concerns about institutional racism that have ignited this rage\\". Mullen warned that \\"our fellow citizens are not the enemy\\" and said American cities and towns were \\"neighbourhoods\\" and not \\"battle spaces to be dominated\\". Mullen concluded \\"This is not the time for stunts. This is the time for leadership.\\" Retired Admiral William McRaven said, \\"You're not going to use, whether it's the military, or the National Guard, or law enforcement, to clear peaceful American citizens for the president of the United States to do a photo op... There is nothing morally right about that.\\" Former Republican Secretary of State Colin Powell said he was \\"proud\\" of the statements issued by retired military leaders. \\"We have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And the President has drifted away from it.\\" In a Bloomberg editorial, former supreme allied commander of NATO, James Stavridis also expressed support for the statements. In a piece in Foreign Policy, retired Marine general and former U.S. envoy John R. Allen wrote that the U.S. under Trump had begun turning illiberal, which \\"may well signal the beginning of the end of the American experiment\\". Allen wrote that Trump \\"doesn't care about the devout, except insofar as they serve his political needs\\" and had \\"failed to project any of the higher emotions or leadership desperately needed in every quarter of this nation during this dire moment\\". Allen also wrote \\"It wasn't enough that peaceful protesters had just been deprived of their first-amendment rights‚Äîthis photo-op sought to legitimize that abuse with a layer of religion.\\" On June 2, the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy James Miller resigned from the Defense Science Board in protest after the incident, while sharing his resignation letter with The Washington Post. Miller wrote that Trump \\"violated his oath to 'take care that the laws be faithfully executed', as well as the First Amendment 'right of the people peaceably to assemble'\\". He cited his own oath of office and wrote that Esper had violated the same oath‚Äîto support and defend the Constitution‚Äîsaying Esper \\"visibly supported\\" Trump's \\"directing this appalling use of force\\". Miller also criticized Esper's statement urging state governors to \\"dominate the battlespace\\", writing, \\"I cannot believe that you see the United States as a 'battlespace', or that you believe our citizens must be 'dominated'. Such language sends an extremely dangerous signal.\\" Retired Army general Wesley Clark, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO, said: \\"It was really shocking and outrageous. There was no reason for it. Then to see the president come across with the military leadership, oh, it looked ugly.\\" National Guard on the scene One of the Guardsmen on the scene later recalled, \\"As a military officer, what I saw was more or less really fucked up... the crowd was loud but peaceful, and at no point did I feel in danger, and I was standing right there in the front of the line. A lot of us are still struggling to process this, but in a lot of ways, I believe I saw civil rights being violated in order for a photo op.\\" Another guardsman confirmed the presence of tear gas, adding that \\"I've been tear gassed before. I was there the night before when we got tear gassed, [and] there was tear gas there\\" Monday evening. =Scholars= Law professor Garrett Epps wrote that \\"the dispersal of the peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square was a monstrous violation of America's venerable right of assembly\\" as guaranteed by the Constitution's First Amendment. John Fea, a professor of American history at Messiah College, said, \\"Looking back through history, whenever you see someone in authority using the Bible to justify law and order, it ends badly.\\" Historian Robert Kagan, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and Washington Post contributing columnist, wrote that General Milley's appearance in the photo‚Äîin combat uniform‚Äîmight \\"turn out to be the first in a series of pictures in some future history text about the undermining of American democracy\\". Princeton University's Eddie Glaude said the photo op represents \\"the theater of dictatorial power\\", asserting that \\"people saw it clearly for what it was, and to conscript the military into that performance made concrete the feeling that not only are we seeing the erosion of democratic norms, but the very institutions of the country are in jeopardy.\\" Jameel Jaffer of the Knight First Amendment Institute said there was a strong legal case that the protester's First Amendment rights were violated. Of particular relevance is a 2015 legal settlement made after the unlawful 2002 mass arrest of anti- globalization protesters in Pershing Park. In the settlement, the U.S. Park Police agreed to revise its policies to ensure warnings to protesters that they are in violation of the law are clearly audible to the entire crowd, and that demonstrators have adequate time to respond to instructions. =Media= The New York Times editorial board called Attorney General William Barr's decision to forcibly clear a peaceful protest in a public park and churchyard for Trump to conduct a photo-op \\"a brazen display of this administration's disregard for the First Amendment\\" that \\"managed to take aim at the freedom of assembly, speech and religion all at the same time\\". The Washington Post editorial board criticized Barr and Trump's actions as \\"cheap political theater\\" and called upon leaders in Congress and the military to dissuade Trump from deploying active-duty Army soldiers on Americans streets (as Trump indicated he might do), saying such a move would be \\"unacceptable\\" and \\"move America closer to anarchy\\". =International= The scenes of peaceful protesters being violently dispersed were seized upon by the U.S.'s international adversaries, undercutting U.S. diplomats' efforts to promote democracy and human rights abroad. Representatives of Russia, China, and Iran have used the event to challenge America's moral authority and historical advocacy for the rights of protesters. Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, was asked to comment on Trump's proposal of using the military against protesters in the United States, as well as the protesters being cleared for the photo op. Trudeau paused for 21 seconds before responding: \\"We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on in the United States\\". Trudeau continued, \\"it is a time to listen\\" and \\"a time to learn what injustices continue despite progress\\", before discussing Canada's own challenges, including \\"systemic discrimination\\".

Most of the events were peaceful, while some involved violence, looting and destruction of property. Timeline May 29 = 14th and U Street NW on May 29 The White House was on lockdown the night of May 29 in response to protests reaching the gates. The protests began at 7:00p.m. By 8:30p.m., the White House lockdown was lifted as protesters began to leave. At 10:00p.m., the protesters returned however by 3:30 am Saturday the protesters were more subdued. The protesters came into conflict with the United States Secret Service. At times, the protesters got close enough to inflict minor injuries on certain officers. At one point the protesters were pepper sprayed. Several Secret Service agents reportedly suffered broken bones due to rocks and bottles of urine and alcohol thrown at them by rioters. As a result of the protests, the Secret Service rushed President Donald Trump to shelter in the White House underground bunker, where he remained for almost one hour. This occurred after some protesters crossed temporary barricades set up near the Treasury Department buildings. Around that time, the Secret Service alert level was raised to \\"red\\". The president's wife and son were also brought to the bunker. Trump later falsely claimed that he had only gone to the bunker for an \\"inspection\\", and also claimed that he was in the bunker \\"for a tiny, little short period of time\\". Attorney General William Barr later stated that the May 29 protests \\"were so bad that the Secret Service recommended that the President go down to the bunker\\". President Trump responded to the White House protesters on Twitter, saying that if they had crossed the White House fence they would have been attacked by \\"the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons\\". He also stated that \\"many Secret Service agents [are] just waiting for action\\", and accused the protesters of being \\"professionally organized\\". The Secret Service reported that six people were arrested in Lafayette Square within President's Park, directly north of the White House. D.C. Metro Police and US Park Police were also on the scene. = May 30 = Vehicles on fire, May 30 Protesters gathered around the White House again on May 30. Police vehicles were damaged with one protester graffitiing words disparaging the President. Monuments on the National Mall including the Lincoln Memorial and National World War II Memorial were defaced. = May 31 = Protest at 15th and I Street NW on May 31 On May 31, dozens of businesses in CityCenter, Georgetown, and Farragut Square were looted. A BBC cameraman, Peter Murtaugh, was purposely attacked by police outside the White House. Murtaugh filmed a line of police officers charging without warning, whereby a shield-wielding officer tackled Murtaugh to the ground. A fellow BBC journalist said the attack had occurred before a curfew was imposed. = June 1 = President Donald Trump held a bible in front of St. John's Episcopal ChurchIn response to violent protests, Mayor Bowser announced a citywide curfew from 7pm to 6am, which remained in effect through June 3. An additional curfew from 11pm to 6am was added for the night of June 3. Amid ongoing protests, U.S. Park Police and National Guard troops used tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper spray, stingball grenades, horses, shields and batons to clear peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Square and surrounding streets, creating a path for President Trump to walk to St. John's Episcopal Church. Trump held a bible and posed for photos in front of the church, which was damaged in a fire during protests on May 31. The enforcement action was seen by many as excessive and an affront to First Amendment rights of peaceful protesters. The U.S. Park Police disputes this interpretation of events. Local resident Rahul Dubey, was widely praised by protesters after he allowed over seventy of them to spend the night in his row home after being boxed in by police officers. At least one of the protesters inside the home live streamed the incident and the interactions between the police and Dubey after the police refused to leave from his doorstep, and created a large social media following of the story. =June 2= Protest at Capitol Hill on June 2 On Tuesday, up to 2,000 people demonstrated, the largest crowd up to that date. Senator Elizabeth Warren and her husband Bruce H. Mann spoke with protesters. The protests centered on Lafayette Square in front of the White House, and also included a march to the Capitol Building. The President and First Lady visited Saint John Paul II National Shrine during the day, drawing the condemnation of Archbishop Wilton Daniel Gregory, the head of the Archdiocese of Washington, as well as a crowd of two hundred peaceful protesters nearby. Overall, federal law enforcement presence was notably increased, which Mayor Muriel Bowser said was not the result of a request by the city. In contrast with previous days, little violence occurred. = June 3 = Protest at the United States Capitol on June 3 Over 5,000 were estimated to have taken part in peaceful demonstrations across the city, including those well past curfew into Thursday morning. No arrests were made, and no confrontations with police or damage to police property occurred. One group of protesters marched a route through the city, with National Guard troops and federal agents monitoring. Barricades had been erected around certain areas of the capital and were maintained by Capitol Police. The names of those who had died in previous police encounters were read aloud, and protesters had demonstrated in front of the Capitol building and the Trump International Hotel. In the evening protesters gathered in Lafayette Park or staged a die-in on Pennsylvania Avenue for about eight minutes chanting, \\"I can't breathe\\". Barr announced that he would \\"flood the zone\\" in D.C. by bringing in law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies. Barr himself was supervising the operation from an FBI command center in Washington's Chinatown. The deployment involved at least 5,800 troops, agents, and officers including personnel from the National Guard, US Secret Service, US Park Police, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, US Marshals Service, Bureau of Prisons, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Protective Service and the Transportation Security Administration. The heavily-armed officers wore uniforms with no name badges and no insignia to show what agency they worked for, and they refused to answer questions. =June 4= Installation of a fence around Lafayette Park on June 4 Thursday was the first day the municipal government did not impose a curfew since Sunday. Protests on June 4 were peaceful and D.C. police did not make a single arrest. During the day, several hundred protesters gathered peacefully, kneeling with raised fists at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, which in previous days have been blocked off by National Guard soldiers. A large die-in was held for over eight minutes at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial as well. Around 8pm, a thunderstorm rolled in and dispersed of the protesters at the White House. Two National Guardsman, non-critically injured by a lightning strike in Lafayette Square shortly after midnight, were the only reported casualties of the protests. An internal document (‚ÄúDomestic Unrest -- Washington D.C. Overview‚Äù) compiled June 4, 2020 for General Mark Milley and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reports that 7,600 troops or personnel are deployed (5885) in Washington, D.C. or stationed (1,704) near Washington, D.C. 2,935 National Guard troops, 500 U.S. Capitol Police, 500 Washington, D.C. Police Department and 500 U.S. Secret Service, 445 Bureau of Prisons staff, 168 U.S. Marshals Service members, 160 Drug Enforcement Administration employees, 80 U.S. Park Police and 32 FBI agents are deployed in Washington, D.C.. 1,704 active-duty Army troops are stationed at Andrews Air Force Base, Fort Belvoir and Fort Myer. =June 5= Part of the mural reading \\"Black Lives Matter\\" painted on 16th Street NW on June 5 On June 5 muralists painted the words \\"Black Lives Matter\\" in 35-foot letters on 16th Street NW leading up to the White House and Lafayette Square with the assistance of the city government, which gave the section of the street the honorary name Black Lives Matter Plaza. Mayor Bowser asked Trump to \\"withdraw all extraordinary law enforcement and military presence from Washington, D.C.\\", noting that protests the night before had been peaceful and she has ended the protest-related state of emergency in the city. The Pentagon later that day announced it was withdrawing 1,600 active-duty troops it had deployed near the city. = June 6 = Protesters on June 6 Demonstrations on Saturday featured over 10,000 people, the most of any in the city up to that point. Among the protesters that day were Senators Mitt Romney, Elizabeth Warren, and Representative John Lewis. The largest were centered around the White House, as in previous days, specifically several blocks running up to it on 16th Street. Other gatherings occurred intermittently at various locations, including 14th & U Street, Meridian Hill Park, the Lincoln Memorial, the Capitol Building, Chinatown, and Thomas Circle. Some of these marches subsequently converged on 16th Street. Law enforcement presence was heavily scaled back, and the atmosphere resembled what some participants characterized as resembling a \\"block party\\" or \\"festival\\", in sharp contrast to the previous weekend. Some individuals spray- painted \\"Defund the Police\\" on the street where \\"Black Lives Matter\\" had been painted earlier the previous day, in a move intended to criticize Mayor Bowser, who also spoke at the protests near the White House. Police reported one arrest, for property damage, related to the protests on the 6th. =June 7= Protests continued on Sunday June 7. Protests at the new Black Lives Matter Plaza on 16th Street in front of the White House remained peaceful in the evening. The atmosphere of the protests was described in media as less tense than in previous days. In a tweet, President Trump said he had ordered the National Guard to withdraw. = June 19 = On the night of Juneteenth protesters gathered at the Albert Pike Memorial in Judiciary Square and using ropes and chains toppled the statue of Pike. The statue was set on fire and a few minutes later local police extinguished the flames. The statue was removed the following day by the National Park Service (NPS). In response to the Pike statue being toppled, Trump tweeted: \\"The D.C. police are not doing their job as they watch a statue be ripped down & burn. These people should be immediately arrested.

The shooting took place during the George Floyd protests in Omaha, Nebraska, in the Old Market area of the city, where Scurlock and friends had been among the thousands of demonstrators who flooded the city's downtown area. Gardner had been involved in an altercation with a group of people including Scurlock. Gardner took his gun from his waistband and was then tackled to the ground by two people and fired two shots in the air. Then Scurlock jumped on Gardner's back. After a 20 second struggle, Gardner shot over his shoulder at Scurlock, fatally wounding him. Scurlock was pronounced dead at a hospital that night. Gardner was released from police custody after the county attorney concluded that he had acted in self-defense against Scurlock. The decision proved controversial based on Gardner's history and accusations of racial motivation. It has been described as exacerbating tensions in the United States, and the case was referred to a grand jury for review; a grand jury returned indictments against Gardner on September 15 on four felony criminal charges, including manslaughter. On September 20, 2020, the deadline for Gardner to turn himself in, he committed suicide outside a medical center in Hillsboro, Oregon, where he moved to after the incident. His death is currently under investigation by Hillsboro police and medical examiners.  Incident  On Saturday, May 30, 2020, around 11:00pm, James Scurlock and group of protesters was in the Old Market area of Omaha, Nebraska, during the George Floyd protests. Scurlock was headed east toward the business belonging to Jacob Gardner, a white bar owner. Gardner and his father stood guard near his closed business, The Hive. They later walked east down Harney Street and pushed two people, telling them to leave. Gardner's father was then knocked to the ground by one man. A verbal altercation between Gardner and a group of people he believed had hit his father ensued. Gardner positioned himself in the midst of the protestors. He lifted his shirt, making it known he was carrying a concealed handgun in his waistband. He then withdrew the handgun from his waistband and held it at his side. As he was backing up, he was tackled to the ground by two people. Gardner fired two shots in the air (which he would later describe as warning shots to the police), and his two attackers fled. It was then that Scurlock jumped on Gardner's back as he was getting up and held him to the ground. After both had struggled for around 20 seconds, Gardner fired a third shot behind his back, striking Scurlock in his clavicle. Scurlock was taken to Nebraska Medicine where he died from his injuries.https://omaha.com/news/crime/omaha-police-looking-to-identify- person-shoved-by-bar-owners- father/article_071656ce-b914-55e8-a664-b33a3b01bea6.html  Investigation Initial= By Saturday night, Gardner was held in police custody at the Omaha Police Department headquarters while an investigation was conducted. He was released late Sunday night and was not booked into jail while he was in police custody. Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine reviewed the evidence, including interviews and witnesses. At a press conference on Monday, June 1, Kleine announced that no charges would be filed against Gardner at that time. Kleine described what occurred in the incident, showed copies of video evidence for the audience, narrating what took place, and explained the conclusion that Gardner had acted in self-defense. Prosecutors said Gardner had once held an active Nebraska Concealed Handgun Permit, but that it had expired by the time of the shooting. =Grand jury= The Scurlock family's attorney and Nebraska State Senator, Justin Wayne, asked Kleine to send the case to a grand jury. He explained Gardner should face other charges, such as manslaughter, a concealed carry permit violation, or for firing gunshots within the Omaha city limits. On June 3, 2020, Kleine called a grand jury with a special prosecutor to review the case. He met with Omaha Councilperson Ben Gray and Douglas County Commissioner Chris Rodgers to consider involving the United States Department of Justice. On June 8, Frederick D. Franklin, a federal prosecutor, was appointed to lead the grand jury investigation. =Charges and Gardner's death= On September 15, 2020, Gardner was indicted by the grand jury on manslaughter, attempted first-degree assault, making terroristic threats and use of a weapon to commit a felony. If convicted, Gardner could have faced a maximum of 95 years imprisonment. His reported deadline date to turn himself in was September 20. On September 20, 2020, Gardner died of suicide in Hillsboro, Oregon. He was found dead of possible gunshot wounds outside a medical center. Gardner had left Nebraska allegedly due to death threats he was receiving there, and initially stayed in Northern California but relocated to Oregon during the wildfires. He had stayed with an uncle in the Portland area prior to his death.  Protests  The death was reported internationally as exacerbating tensions in the United States. On May 31, there was a Black Lives Matter and George Floyd protest in Kearney, Nebraska, that also included demonstrations in Scurlock's name. Signs included slogans like \\"Justice for James.\\" It started at the Museum of Nebraska Art and continued to the intersection of Second Avenue and 25th Street. On June 1, 2020, approximately 300 attended demonstrations in Omaha. Many chanted \\"What about James?\\" and 80 were arrested. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts apologized to the Black community after saying \\"where the hell were you people?\\" during a heated meeting with local Black leaders. On June 5, 2020, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in memory of Scurlock and to protest racism and racial inequality. They began at Memorial Park and marched across the Dodge Street Pedestrian Bridge to Elmwood Park. Omaha Councilperson Pete Festersen and Scurlock's family attended the protest. On June 5, 2020, local radio station KFAB posted a video showing Scurlock inside of Old Market businesses vandalizing them just prior to the incident, and interviewed Don Kleine on why his office chose not to release the video.Video Shows Scurlock Trashing Old Market Business  Reactions  Videos of the incident were posted on social media. Scurlock's father, James Scurlock II, stated that he wanted justice. He said he did not want people to loot or commit acts of violence in Scurlock's name. The family's attorney Justin Wayne said, \\"In this community, we prosecute black and brown individuals a lot more for things like we just watched,\\" in reference to the video of the incident shown at the press conference. Governor Pete Ricketts stated that \\"the loss of anybody's life is a tragedy, certainly a personal tragedy for the family and a tragedy for the community.\\" He said he supported Kleine's decision to not press charges. He suggested the public watch the incident for themselves. Ricketts called for peaceful protests. The Miami Herald reported that Nebraska State Senator Megan Hunt tweeted: \\"Don Kleine and Douglas County have made a huge mistake. James Scurlock was murdered, and his murderer should be put on trial. With this decision, our justice process never even had a chance to work.\\" (Original tweet, Retrieved June 5, 2020) On June 1, 2020, the rock band 311 and its vocalist Nick Hexum posted on social media that Scurlock was shot dead by a fan of their group, and that they did not condone the violence shown in the shooting. On June 4, 2020, a spray painted mural of Scurlock was completed in Omaha near 24th and Camden. It was created by a collaboration of over 100 artists. Another mural was created at 16th and Farnam. The owners of the building in which Gardner's bar was located evicted him shortly after the incident, alleging that Gardner had not complied with the terms of his lease.

When his proposals were rejected, Wang Tong lost confidence in the Sui court and resigned his post. Leaving Chang'an, he retired to the Hefen region and dedicated himself fully to teaching. During this time, he also wrote numerous works on Confucian philosophy. His most famous (and only surviving) work is the philosophical treatise Zhongshuo (‰∏≠ËØ¥), Explanation on the Mean (‰∏≠Ë™™) which was said to have been compiled by his sons shortly after his death (although the circumstances around the compilation of the Zhongshuo still remains a point of scholarly controversy to this day). The Zhongshuo sought to be a revival of Confucian thought after the turmoil of the Sixteen Kingdoms and Northern and Southern Dynasties periods. The work was purposely written in the same style as the Analects and is just as wide-ranging as the original. It comes a myriad of topics, from ideas about education and moral cultivation to what Confucianism can learn from the competing schools of Daoism and Buddhism. With the work and his teachings, Wang Tong sought to revive pre-Qin Dynasty Confucianism, and not what he saw as the perverted Confucianism of the Han Dynasty.People's Political Consultative Conference Cultural WeeklyÔºö ÁéãÈÄöÁöÑ‰ª∑ÂÄº‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‰∏∫„ÄäÂ±±Ë•ø‰∏áËç£ÂéøÈÄöÂåñÊùëÂè≤„ÄãÂ∫è Wang Tong is the grandfather of Wang Bo, famous poet and one of the Four Paragons of the Early Tang.  Influence  Wang Tong is a controversial figure in Confucianism. During his life, as well as the period immediately after it, Wang Tong was viewed by the Sui and early Tang courts as being egregiously \\"out of step with prevailing Confucian ideology\\", with some scholars suggesting this official disdain led to him not being included in the Book of Sui. Many later Confucians would also take offense to Wang Tong's supposed hubris in emulating the writing style of the Analects and acting as though he were an equal to Confucius himself. Later, detractors in the Qing dynasty would question his very existence, pointing out his youth and various dating discrepancies. Today, there is a broad consensus among both Western and Chinese scholars that Wang Tong was a real Sui Dynasty Confucian teacher, although some debate remains over how the Zhongshuo was compiled. Despite the controversy, Wang Tong's Zhongshuo is undoubtably an extremely important work in the Confucian canon, and his ideas would prove very influential for many later Confucians. Wang's innovative ideas were said to have enlivened Confucianism after the turmoil of the previous two centuries. His work on political philosophy and the master-subject relationship has been said to have been influential during the early Tang Dynasty, especially during the Zhenguan era (Ë≤ûËßÄ‰πãÊ≤ª) of Tang Taizong (a famous golden era in Chinese history). Song Dynasty philosopher Cheng Yi said that Wang Tong surpassed famous Han Dynasty Confucian Yang Xiong in merit. Later, eminent Ming Dynasty Confucian Wang Yangming praised Wang Tong in his Instructions for Practical LivingChuanlixuÔºå‰º†‰π†ÂΩï and defended his emulation of the Confucian Classics, saying that \\"Master Wenzhong was a worthy scholar\\" and that famous Neo-Confucian Han Yu was \\"vastly inferior to Master Wenzhong\\". While still poorly studied in modern times, scholarship on Wang Tong has been picking up since the revival of interest in Confucianism that followed the Chinese Economic Reform of the late 1970s.Â∞πÂçèÁêÜÁöÑ„ÄäÁéãÈÄöËÆ∫„Äãand ÊùéÂ∞èÊàêÁöÑ„ÄäÊñá‰∏≠Â≠êËÄÉËÆ∫„Äã  References  Notes Bibliography= * * People's Political Consultative Conference Cultural WeeklyÔºö ÁéãÈÄöÁöÑ‰ª∑ÂÄº‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‰∏∫„ÄäÂ±±Ë•ø‰∏áËç£ÂéøÈÄöÂåñÊùëÂè≤„ÄãÂ∫è * Further reading * Chinese Wikisource has the full text of the Explanation on the Mean (‰∏≠Ë™™) * https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%8E%8B%E9%80%9A/8621684 Category:Sui dynasty politicians Category:Chinese Confucianists ","title":"Wang Tong (philosopher)"},{"id":"64148297","text":"Mort Landsberg (July 25, 1919 ‚Äì December 31, 1970) was an American football halfback.

Planning  In 1980, while the couple dealt with bureaucratic gridlock on other projects, a Miami community art festival invited Christo and Jeanne-Claude to participate. While they declined on account of the Miami summer heat, they continued to explore the idea for a project in the city. Jeanne-Claude conceived the concept, which would surround 11 spoil islands with floating pink fabric in Miami's Biscayne Bay. They reviewed the engineering and environmental impacts for three years, learning about the bay's protected wildlife, commissioning studies of local wildlife, scoping logistics for anchoring the fabric to the islands, and experimenting with floating fabrics. The work also involved lobbying work to acquire public support, governmental approval, and permits. Their lawyers handled a federal lawsuit from a wildlife paramedic. The artists, as was their practice, restored environments to their original condition, but in Miami's case, they additionally cleaned 40 tons of waste during the project. The installation mounted for 11 days in May 1983. It was isolated, existing across 11 miles in the bay, and was mainly consumed through mass media, being best portrayed by aerial photography and over television. Surrounded Islands was the couple's most expensive work to date and their largest work by size in their lifetimes. The finished work played a strong role in developing the city's reputation as a place of culture.

Patients experiencing one of the most terrifying times of their lives are unable to see the faces of their medical staff, but having a photo sticker on the staff's PPE gown allows the patient to better relate to their caregiver. This project was revived in 2020 by Stanford social scientist Cati Brown-Johnson and featured on The Rachel Maddow Show, NPR, Smithsonian magazine and KQED. 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak The idea came from the 2014/2015 Ebola outbreak in Liberia. American artist Mary Beth Heffernan, who is a professor of art and art history at Occidental College, saw the full suits the Ebola health workers were wearing and she created the PPE Portrait Project. Heffernan called it \\"an art intervention designed to improve Ebola care\\". Regarding cultural sensitivity, Heffernan said that developing the project \\"involved close readings of Ebola survivors‚Äô stories, in particular the first-person narratives of doctors who became infected and lived to write about it. Their stories were electrifying, and the words they chose to describe their experience‚Äîof being sick, isolated, and the trauma of not seeing a human face in their caregivers‚Äîare seared in my mind.\\" The grant funded project focused on isolation of patients‚Äîthe benefits of \\"puncturing that isolation\\" by allowing patients to better connect with their providers. Liberian doctors J. Soka Moses and Moses Massaquoi invited Heffernan to visit with the Ebola doctors and staff. Massaquoi said that he was receiving emails from people \\"pitching some untested scheme ... it was getting to be kind of a pain\\". But the proposal to put photos on the suits made so much sense he responded to Heffernan immediately. Heffernan told Maddow staff that she \\"had hoped the PPE portraits would become standard best medical practice for all kinds of patients who have to experience isolation of never seeing people outside of PPE‚Äîonly masked faces for days at a time.\\" The Gold Foundation funded Heffernan to travel to Liberia. Heffernan had received $5000 that she was using for this project. Health care staff there \\"reported feeling more human\\". She spent three weeks training the staff and left supplies for them to use. Heffernan wanted the project to be \\"sustainable and achievable with local means.\\" The project was featured in the Being Human exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London in September 2019. The exhibit featured manequins dressed in PPE with PPE Portrait labels. Heffernan provided first-person narratives from the healthcare workers featured to accompany the exhibit. Those featured received an honorarium for the use of their image and story. In the five years since Ebola, Heffernan approached many hospitals but found that they were uninterested. Medical staff wearing full PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic has changed that attitude with many hospitals. However, many of the providers involved in the original project have reported that they are not currently using PPE Portrait labels, as they are instead focused on the challenges of \\"sourcing and rigorously using the PPE itself.\\" COVID-19 pandemic Cati Brown-Johnson from Stanford University School of Medicine revived the project for the COVID-19 pandemic. She says she is a social scientist who is interested in human connections. Brown-Johnson says the research behind this idea shows that \\"a warm and competent provider connects with the healing mechanisms within a person's own body. And PPE, obviously it's straight up and down ... competence. It tells you competence right away, the only warmth you might get would be a PPE portrait, that is some of the basis of the research that has us interested in pursuing this.\\" Brown-Johnson further said that they are seeing an improvement in the morale of the medical staff as it makes them feel more humanized. Brown-Johnson first tried out the revived program at a drive-thru testing site at Stanford. Staff during one of the trial tests for the project said that right away they noticed better interactions with patients. One nurse, Anna Chico who worked in the drive-up COVID‚Äë19 testing site, said she introduced herself by pointing to her portrait and saying \\"this is me under all this\\". Doctors reported that it felt like they were working with people on the team, \\"instead of inanimate objects\\". The Rachel Maddow Show learned about this project when they noticed that doctor Ernest Patti from St. Barnabas Hospital, whom they had interviewed several times on the show about his experiences working with COVID‚Äë19 patients, appeared in full PPE but with a smiling photo of himself on the outside of his PPE gown. The Maddow staff inquired with Patti and learned that a woman had seen him on previous Maddow shows and mailed him a set of stickers of his own face for use on his gown. The woman was Dr. Lori Justice Shocket who is an artist and holds a medical degree. She is also married to an ER doctor and has a child and step child who are also ER doctors. Shocket asks people to email her photos of their faces; she prints stickers and mails them back. The goal of the project according to Heffernan is to give hospitals the tools and training so they can independently run the project. She hopes that all medical staff will use PPE portraits irrespective of if they are in full PPE or not. In situations where medical staff are wearing a mask, seeing a smiling photo would be beneficial for the patient. Maddow further said of the PPE Portrait project that seeing a photo of their caregiver helps create a genuine connection instead of an \\"alien connection, even when they are doing the best to save your life\\". Smithsonian magazine states the feeling of seeing someone in full PPE is like \\"anonymizing these individuals as masked, expressionless staff in space suits\\". In Liberia, Heffernan said that the medical workers \\"found themselves perceived as ‚Äòscary ninjas‚Äô ‚Äî are isolating, dehumanizing and compound patient fear\\". Other hospitals starting to use PPE portraits as of April 2020 are the University of Massachusetts Medical School, USC Keck School of Medicine and Boston Children's Hospital. Practicalities Stanford medicine's website suggests that in high risk settings the photo will be discarded with the disposal of the gown. In lower risk settings where the gown will be reused, the photo sticker will need to be disinfected before using the gown, much in the same way a name badge would be. Stanford suggests that if you are creating the portrait of yourself you should use the portrait setting on your smartphone, look directly into the camera lens and \\"offer the smile you want your patients to see\\". Heffernan recommends using 8.5\\"√ó11\\" matte surface sticky labels that are not reusable. Laminating, disinfecting and reusing was first discussed but there were concerns that the hard edge of the plastic might damage the PPE gown and become a source for contamination. Medical staff can keep a supply of photo labels in the donning area. It is suggested that the photo be worn at \\"heart level, \\"because your care is coming from your heart\\".

The entrance to the cemetery incorporates a memorial wall, commemorating 346 Commonwealth servicemen and one Dutch serviceman who died while serving in Ceylon during the Second World War (1939-1945), whose graves/bodies could not be found. In addition the cemetery contains the Liveramentu Cremation Memorial which commemorates 165 servicemen of the Hindu faith who died while serving in Ceylon, and who were accorded the last rite required by their religion - committal to fire. The memorial is in the form of a stone pylon crowned with a stone urn, with wing walls inscribed with the servicemen's names. The cemetery also has a memorial commemorating 28 Italian prisoners of war who died and were buried in the country between 1939 and 1945. The cemetery is situated on the site of a Portuguese church, Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Livramento, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the Virgin of Good Deliverance, from which it derives its name. The church was a well known Marian shrine, with a well whose waters were alleged to perform miracles. The church was subsequently destroyed by the Dutch. The site was declared a protected archaeological site on 8 July 2005.

As of October 19, 2020, there have been 11,152 confirmed COVID-19 cases of Filipino citizens residing outside the Philippines with 7,201 recoveries and 812 deaths. The official count from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on the cases of overseas Filipinos is not included in the national tally of the Philippine government. Repatriates on the other hand are included in the national tally of the Department of Health (DOH) but are listed separately from regional counts.  Background  The DFA provides information regarding the number of Filipino nationals abroad to have contracted COVID-19 and keeps an official tally of confirmed cases by region instead of by country. This count is not included in the national tally of cases provided by the DOH. The DFA collects information regarding the Filipino nationals with COVID-19 from its diplomatic posts abroad which in turn rely information from the patients themselves, their relatives and Filipino expatriate communities. Efforts to collect and disseminate data by the DFA is hampered due to the prohibition of classifying patients by nationality in some countries as well as requests by some Filipino patients for strict confidentiality regarding their situation. A small number of the DFA's COVID-19 tally has been verified by the Department of Health International Health Regulations (DOH-IHR). The first confirmed case of a Filipino national outside the Philippines was announced by the DFA on February 5, 2020. It involves a crew member of the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan.  Cases by region  Asia Pacific = In the Asia Pacific region, outside the Diamond Princess, at least one Filipino case has been confirmed in Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei, mainland China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, India, Malaysia, the Maldives,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-07/01/c_139180673.htm Singapore, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Following an international tabligh convention held from February 7 to March 1, 2020, at the Jamek Sri Petaling mosque near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the DFA reported that 19 Filipinos who attended the convention tested positive and were quarantined in Malaysia. Two others managed to return to the Philippines and later tested positive by Philippine health authorities. In Singapore, at least 134 Filipinos tested positive for COVID-19. In Japan, at least 28 \\"land-based\\" Filipinos mostly based in Osaka were confirmed to have contracted COVID-19. 121 others Filipinos, who are seafarers of Diamond Princess in docked off the coast of Yokohama and the Costa Atlantica in Osaka also tested positive for COVID-19. No fatality was recorded in Japan as of June 15. = Middle East and Africa = In the Middle East at least one Filipino case has been recorded in Egypt, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. One notable case in the region was that of Philippine ambassador to Lebanon, Bernardita Catalla, who died on April 2 in Beirut due to complications from COVID-19 and chronic respiratory problems. One of the most affected country in the region is Saudi Arabia where at least 119 Filipinos tested positive for COVID-19, and at least five died from the disease. The Philippine embassy in Riyadh's office of labor affairs announced on June 14 its temporarily closure after six of its staff tested positive for COVID-19. In Kuwait, at least 300 Filipinos were confirmed to have tested positive for COVID-19, 31 of them have died from the disease. In the United Arab Emirates, at least 40 Filipinos have died from COVID-19 in Dubai alone. According to the Department of Labor and Employment, there are at least 3,000 Filipino COVID-19 cases in Qatar. This information though was released without clearance from the Philippine embassy in Doha. = Europe = In Europe, at least one Filipino case has been confirmed in France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. On March 23, Philippine Council for Foreign Relations President Alan Ortiz died in Paris, France. Some Filipinos in Italy were also reported to have contracted COVID-19, although the exact number of cases cannot be disclosed due to privacy law in Italy. In Spain, at least 82 Filipinos tested positive for COVID-19, while six have died from the disease. In the United Kingdom, there are at least 573 Filipinos, including dual nationals and ethnic Filipinos who holds no Philippine-citizenship who tested positive for COVID-19. At least 78 of this figure died from the disease. In Ireland, there are at least 80 confirmed Filipino COVID-19 cases, and three deaths. At least 32 Filipino crew members of the MS Roald Amundsen which was docked in Troms√∏, Norway tested positive for COVID-19. = Americas = In the United States, it was confirmed that six Filipinos aboard the Grand Princess cruise ship, which docked in Oakland, California for quarantine, had contracted the virus. On March 13, a Filipino working in New York as a diplomat with the Philippines' UN mission was confirmed to be positive for the virus, which led to the entire mission at the Philippine Center being disinfected and closed for the day. Filipino Americans have been among the hardest hit ethnic groups with COVID-19, in part because of a high percentage of Filipino Americans are in healthcare professions or in essential work such as postal service, grocery store work, and santiation. In Canada, at least 200 Filipinos contracted COVID-19 as of mid-May 2020. Some Filipinos in the Caribbean also reportedly tested positive for the disease. There are no recorded cases among land-based Overseas Filipino Workers in Brazil as of July 30, which has the second highest COVID-19 cases in the world at the time according to the Philippines' ambassador to Brazil Marichu Mauro. However Mauro noted that 14 Filipino seafarers whose ship has recently docked in Brazil tested positive for the disease.  Repatriation  Repatriated Filipinos disembark their plane at Clark Air Base, Pampanga on February 9. The Philippine national government has repatriated citizens from various COVID-19 affected countries and cruise ships. As of April 13, at least 13,000 Overseas Filipino Workers have been repatriated according to the DFA. Philippine Airlines, the country's flag carrier, has volunteered several repatriation flights as early as March. The first of such efforts by the government involved repatriating Filipino nationals in Hubei, China. The government began the repatriation process on January 18. Upon arrival in the Philippines, individuals underwent mandatory quarantine for 14 days. The Athlete's Village at the New Clark City Sports Hub which also has a clinic run by the Philippine General Hospital was chosen as the quarantine site for repatriated Filipinos and New Clark City was locked down on February 6 in preparation for the arrival of the repatriated.  Impact  According to the OWWA, around 300,000 to 400,000 OFWs are estimated to be affected by the pandemic either from pay-cuts, lay-offs, and repatriation. Remittances from OFWs to the Philippine economy which would have served as a cushion to the pandemic's other economic impact is also likewise to be affected. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the country's central bank, projects a 2 to 3 percent decline from last year. In 2019, remittance from OFWs amounted to $33.9 billion or almost ten percent of the Philippines' gross domestic product. The National Economic and Development Authority, then under Secretary Ernesto Pernia projects a $6.7 billion to $10 billion loss in remittance. Around 20,000 Filipino seafarers across the world has also lost their jobs.

He served in the cabinet of Rhodesia as Minister of Agriculture from 1968 to 1976, Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1979, and Minister of Commerce and Industry from 1978 to 1979. From 1976 to 1979, he also served Deputy Prime Minister of Rhodesia. He continued to serve as Minister of Finance in the government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979. In 1980, he was appointed Minister of Trade and Commerce of the newly independent Zimbabwe, one of two whites included in the cabinet of Prime Minister Robert Mugabe. Born in Kintyre, Scotland, Smith emigrated to Southern Rhodesia in 1946 to take up farming. Initially a farm assistant, he rose to become a farm manager and later co- founded a farming enterprise of his own in Mazowe. He was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly in 1965, the year of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, and was added to the cabinet three years later as agriculture minister. He later held the portfolios of finance and commerce, and served for three years as Ian Smith's deputy prime minister. Considered a moderate within the Rhodesian Front, he was one of a few white ministers included in the cabinets of premier Abel Muzorewa of Zimbabwe Rhodesia in 1979, and by Robert Mugabe in 1980. He resigned from the cabinet and the Rhodesian Front in 1981, and remained in retirement in Harare until his death.  Early life and family  Smith was born on 19 April 1922 on the Kintyre peninsula of Argyll, Scotland, either in Campbeltown or at his family's Corran farm in Clachan. He was the son of farmer William Reid Smith, a Newmains native, and Margaret Brown Mundell, who originated from Bellochantuy. He was educated at Campbeltown Grammar School. Smith emigrated to Southern Rhodesia in 1946, sailing from England on the Winchester Castle's first post-war voyage. His brother, Hamish Smith, also moved to the colony and farmed in Nyabira. Prior to leaving, Smith became engaged to Jean Barclay Graham, whom he married in 1948. Together, they had five children, Catherine, Marge, Graham, Elizabeth, and William Lindsay‚Äîwho died in 1952 at the age of two‚Äîand fourteen grandchildren.  Farming in Rhodesia  In Southern Rhodesia, Smith initially worked as a farm assistant, before becoming a farm manager. He later started his own farming enterprise, Smith and Wheeler (Pvt) Ldt., with a partner in Mazowe. He joined the Grain Marketing Board in 1953, and served on several other agricultural committees. He became chairman of the national Farmers' Co-operative in 1966. In 1974, he purchased a farm in Banket worth several hundred thousand dollars.  Political career  In 1965, the year of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence, Smith was elected to the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Assembly for the Marandellas constituency. On 28 September 1968, he was named to Prime Minister Ian Smith's cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, succeeding George Rudland. At that time, Smith was described as the Rhodesian Front's \\"most liberal MP\\" and a moderate within the party who opposed press censorship and favoured a settlement with Britain. He was reelected to Parliament in the 1970 election with 72.5 percent of the vote against independent candidate Thomas Edridge, a Wedza farmer and member of the Rhodesia Tobacco Association's governing council. Edridge and the RTA took issue with price controls put in place by Smith in his capacity as agriculture minister. In April 1970, the month of the election, Smith criticized the RTA and other commodities boards for their political involvement, and accused them of lobbying against him in other government ministries. In 1972, he was elected vice-president of the Rhodesian Front, succeeding Lord Angus Graham. Smith was reelected in 1974 with 79 percent of the vote against Alfred John Harrison, the Rhodesia Party candidate. Smith (center) at the signing of the Internal Settlement on 3 March 1978. On 13 January 1976, Smith was made Minister of Finance after the incumbent minister, John Wrathall, became President of Rhodesia. He became Deputy Prime Minister on 20 August 1976, retaining his finance portfolio. He was returned to Parliament in the 1977 election with 86 percent of the vote against William John Raymond Pratt of the right-wing Rhodesian Action Party. In April 1978, he was appointed joint Minister of Commerce and Industry, serving alongside Ernest Bulle, one of the black co-ministers appointed as a result of the Internal Settlement. That year, he was the first Rhodesian minister to say he would run for Parliament under the Internal Settlement constitution, which would ensure a multiracial government. On 30 May 1979, Smith was appointed Minister of Finance in the government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia, the successor state to Rhodesia. In a by-election held on 24 July 1979 to replace Hilary Squires, Smith was elected unopposed to Parliament for the Borrowdale constituency. In the fall of 1979, he attended the Lancaster House Conference as part of Zimbabwe Rhodesia premier Abel Muzorewa's delegation. He refused to go unless Ian Smith was also allowed to attend, a demand to which Muzorewa acquiesced. After the conference, which ended the Rhodesian Bush War and led to the creation of the independent Zimbabwe, he kept in personal touch with nationalist leaders Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo. In the country's first multiracial elections in 1980, Smith was reelected unopposed as MP for Borrowdale, one of the twenty seats reserved for whites. After the election, he was named Minister of Commerce and Industry in Prime Minister Robert Mugabe's cabinet. He was one of two whites in the cabinet, along with agriculture minister Denis Norman, and was the only minister belonging to the Rhodesian Front. He said he would remain in the party, and Ian Smith played a role in his selection for the cabinet. He was sworn in with the other cabinet ministers on 19 April 1980. Later that year, his title was changed to Minister of Trade and Commerce, with the industry portfolio going to Simba Makoni. In early March 1981, Smith resigned from the cabinet, citing ill health. He resigned from Parliament and the Rhodesian Front on 30 April, saying in a statement that he had decided to retire from politics but would be \\"an interested onlooker\\".  Later life and death  After leaving politics, Smith remained in Zimbabwe in retirement. He enjoyed riding and shooting, and was a member of the Harare Club and Dining Club. He died at his home in Harare on 9 July 1996 at age 74, several years after being diagnosed with heart disease. He was buried at Kilkerran Cemetery in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, with his parents and son, William.

His primary academic appointment is at the University of Colorado at Boulder (UCB), where he is Professor of Philosophy, a fellow of UCB‚Äôs Institute of Cognitive Science, and a member of UCB‚Äôs Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science. He is Regular Visiting Professor at the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs Eidyn Centre and is the co-editor in chief of the British Journal for the Philosophy of Science. Rupert's research addresses questions in philosophy of mind, philosophy of cognitive science, philosophy of science, metaphysics, and epistemology. He has authored over 50 articles in these areas. His book, Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind, was published in 2009 by Oxford University Press.  Education  Rupert received his B.A. in Philosophy from University of Washington in Seattle (1987) and his M.A. (1990) and Ph.D. (1996) from the University of Illinois at Chicago. His dissertation was entitled \\"The Best Test Theory of Extension.\\"  Career  Rupert joined Texas Tech University as a Visiting Assistant Professor in Philosophy in 2000 and, in 2001, became Assistant Professor of Philosophy. He left Texas Tech in 2005 and joined the Philosophy Department at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where he was promoted to Associate Professor in 2009 and Professor in 2013. From 2013 to 2016, he also held a twenty-percent faculty appointment in the University of Edinburgh‚Äôs School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences. He has been awarded visiting or research fellowships by the Australian National University, Ruhr University, Bochum, and Western University (Ontario). He has also held visiting positions at the University of Washington, Seattle, and New York University. During academic year 2005-2006, he was a fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities. From 2015 to 2020. he served as an Associate Editor of British Journal for the Philosophy of Science (BJPS), becoming Co-Editor-in-Chief of the journal in 2020. = Research and work= Rupert's early research focused on naturalistic theories of mental content and related questions about concept acquisition. He is the progenitor of the Best Test Theory of Extension, which assigns content to mental representations on the basis of patterns of causal interaction between the developing subject and kinds and properties in the subject‚Äôs environment. He argued that there is a fundamental overlap between the causal interactions that establish mental content and, at the same time, stabilize and give integrity to the vehicles possessing said content ‚Äì an idea that he pursued within the frameworks of dynamical systems theory (Synthese 1998) and cognitive neuroscience (Journal of Philosophy 2001). Rupert has also published papers on a cluster of issues in the metaphysics of mind and philosophy of science, including mental causation, the nature of properties, and the relation between the sciences of the mind and the more fundamental sciences. The best-known and most influential aspect of Rupert‚Äôs research focuses on situated cognition, which includes topics related to the extended mind, enactivism, embodiment, and distributed cognition. In 2004, he published \\"Challenges to the Hypothesis of Extended Cognition.\\" This paper had sizeable impact on the debate about extended mind and extended cognition, as did his more comprehensive treatment of situated cognition in 2009‚Äôs \\"Cognitive Systems and the Extended Mind. In the latter, he introduces the Conditional Probability of Co-contribution account of cognitive systems, which specifies what it is for a cluster of mechanisms to be bound together into a single cognitive system (or cognitive self), thereby, he argues, delineating the boundary of genuinely cognitive processing. Rupert‚Äôs interest in distributed cognition gave rise to an adjacent research program, on the topic of group minds. In this domain, he has attempted to identify the abstract properties that groups of humans share with individual humans, such that groups might properly be said to have mental or cognitive states of their own. Although his best-known work on this topic (Episteme 2005) takes a skeptical tone, his current efforts in this regard focus on graph-theoretic properties of networks ‚Äì such as a network‚Äôs having a small-world architecture ‚Äì as candidates for such shared properties. In the area of cognitive systems and nature of cognition, Rupert has argued that the mind is massively representational and that philosophers of mind should set aside their commitment to a metaphysically distinctive personal-level. According to the former proposal, cognitive science should attend to the sheer number of mental representations with the same content that contribute to the production of an action or form of behavior. Rupert‚Äôs work on the personal level encourages a flattened conception of the mind, according to which the mental states and processes often thought to be at a distinctive level ‚Äì the level of the whole person ‚Äì should be treated instead as states and processes sitting right alongside such states and processes as those at work in early visual processing or in the subconscious processes that fluidly determine whether incoming speech makes sense. In addition, Rupert has an ongoing interest in epistemology, which has produced papers on metaphilosophy, the a priori, and on the role of so-called subpersonal processing in the determination of epistemic value.

Geography  Upper Campbell Lake is located approximately west of the city of Campbell River, and east of the village of Gold River. Its main tributaries are the Elk River, and the Tlools, Filberg, Cervis and Drum Creeks. Its only outflow is Campbell River, which also flows in from its headwaters nearby at Buttle Lake. The river flows a short distance out of Upper Campbell Lake via the Strathcona Dam into Lower Campbell Lake. Upper Campbell Lake lies in the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone. View of Strathcona Dam (center) and Upper Campbell Lake  History  The building of the Strathcona Dam from 1955-1958 impounded Upper Campbell Lake, raising the level by and causing it to coalesce with Buttle Lake. The damming of the lake also significantly raised the level of the Elk River, another main inflow, which destroyed a large area of elk habitat and has negatively impacted the river function. The flooding removed an estimated 65% of the spawning habitat used by sport fish in the tributaries of the lake. Prior to the dam, Upper Campbell Lake had a surface area of .

It was founded by actor Aleksander Wƒôgierko. History Aleksander Wƒôgierko (1893-1941), Polish-Jewish actor and theatre director. In 1938, the building of the Municipal Theatre ‚Äì Marshal J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski People‚Äôs Home (Polish: Teatr Miejski ‚Äì Dom Ludowy im. Marsza≈Çka J√≥zefa Pi≈Çsudskiego) was completed. Shortly after Christmas, a performance of Cydzik & Co (Polish: Cydzik i sp√≥≈Çka) was staged there, as the first performance in this building. In 1940, a group of distinguished Warsaw actors, under the guidance of Aleksander Wƒôgierko, came to Bia≈Çystok fleeing from the Germans. Their stay in Bia≈Çystok was short, but pivotal, since they created the first permanent company in the theatre. They produced such plays as Intrigue and Love by Friedrich Schiller, Life Pension by Aleksander Fredro, and Pygmalion by George B. Shaw. The most popular event though was a Mickiewicz evening, consisting of excerpts of Pan Tadeusz, Konrad Wallenrod and Forefathers‚Äô Eve (Polish: Dziady). The performances were all in Polish and the national anthem was sung, all this at the time when Bia≈Çystok belonged to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. This episode finished in 1941. While the company was giving guest performances in Minsk and Brest, the Operation Barbarossa broke out. On the way back, some of the artists, including Wƒôgierko, were arrested by the Germans and never returned to Bia≈Çystok. The theatre itself also suffered: part of the building was burnt while the city was being bombarded. Wƒôgierko was even said to have perished in the walls of the Bia≈Çystok theatre. However, this is only a legend, showing how closely the theatre had become connected with this artist in the imagination of the residents of Bia≈Çystok. Wƒôgierko passed away in Warsaw, though it is not clear whether in the ghetto or in Pawiak prison. Shortly after the liberation of the city, a handful of artists who had survived the war and could not immediately return to Warsaw or Cracow, where war was still waging, took cover in Bia≈Çystok. Joanna B≈Ço≈Ñska, Halina Kossobudzka, Halina Czengery, Lidia Zamkow, Marian Meller (the first postwar managing director), Jan ≈öwiderski, and Czes≈Çaw Wo≈Ç≈Çejko made up the first company after the war, and were soon joined by Bia≈Çystok actors. As early as on 22 September 1944 they premiered My Quail Has Fled (Polish: Uciek≈Ça mi przepi√≥reczka) by Stefan ≈ªeromski, which was the first performance in post-war Poland.Historia Dramatycznego - Wrota Podlasia ReferencesExternal links }} Category:Theatres in Bia≈Çystok Category:Theatres completed in 1938 Category:1938 establishments in Poland ","title":"Aleksandr Wƒôgierki Drama Theatre in Bia≈Çystok"},{"id":"64148708","text":"Paula Devine is a former educator and politician from California.

Beatty H.M. Beatty was Cape Government Railways (Western System) Locomotive Superintendent (1885-1896) and Cape Government Railways Chief Locomotive Superintendent (1896-1910). Locomotives By 1901, it was becoming increasingly apparent that a larger and more powerful version of the successful Cape Government Railways 6th Class locomotives would require fireboxes with appreciably larger grate areas. This was not possible with the existing type of frame on a Cape gauge locomotive, where the firebox was arranged between the rearmost coupled wheels. To overcome this problem, Beatty prepared designs for a new Cape 6th Class locomotive with a wheel arrangement of which the frame terminated in front of the firebox, where it connected to a casting termed the \\"bridle casting\\". This casting extended out on either side and had wider spaced frames attached to its rear, which allowed a wider and deeper firebox. This was the first time that such a method of widening the frame had been used and it proved to be so successful that it was copied widely by both the Natal Government Railways (NGR) and the Central South African Railways (CSAR) in their subsequent locomotive designs. The one disadvantage of the bridle casting was that it proved prone to serious damage in even minor collisions. The design was applied to South African locomotives for many years to come, until boiler centre lines were raised to a height which permitted the main frames to be reduced in depth and therefore to continue right through to the rear buffer beam.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J.

It is the largest artistic institution in north-eastern Poland and the most modern cultural center in this part of Europe. History The beginnings of the Symphony Orchestra of the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic date back to 1954, when the State Symphony Orchestra was established in Bialystok. The orchestra's musicians did not have their own headquarters at that time - rehearsals and concerts were held, among others at the Aleksandr Wƒôgierki Drama Theatre or Guest Palace in Bialystok. After twenty years of artistic activity, the orchestra received the status of a philharmonic orchestra and moved to the concert hall at Podle≈õna Street. The idea of creating a Music and Art Center in Bialystok was born in 2004. This initiative was supported by the authorities of the Podlasie Voivodship and on July 9, 2004 a letter of intent was signed regarding the construction of the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic - the European Art Center in Bialystok. The signatories of the agreement were: Local Government of the Podlasie Voivodship represented by the Marshal of the Podlasie Voivodship Janusz Krzy≈ºewski, the Voivode of Podlaskie Voivodeship Marek Strzali≈Ñski and the City of Bia≈Çystok represented by Ryszard Tur - the Mayor of the City of Bia≈Çystok.

At the beginning of 2005, an international urban and architectural competition was announced for the concept of building the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic - the European Art Center in Bialystok. 14 works were submitted to the competition, of which the winning project was selected on April 29, 2005. The winner of the competition was the studio of prof. Marek Budzy≈Ñski from Warsaw, who has completed projects of the Supreme Court and the University of Warsaw Library. On June 27, 2005, the Podlasie Regional Assembly adopted a resolution on the creation of the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic - European Art Center in Bialystok, and prof. Marek Budzy≈Ñski has signed a contract with the local government of the province. Podlasie to develop design documentation for the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic. In August 2005, due to the dynamic artistic and organizational development of the Institution and the opening of the new building planned for 2011, the Bia≈Çystok Philharmonic changed its name to the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic. On September 9, 2005, during the ceremonial inauguration of the 2005/2006 artistic season, Minister of Culture Waldemar DƒÖbrowski and Marshal of the Podlasie Province Janusz Kazimierz Krzy≈ºewski signed an agreement on the creation of a national cultural institution - the Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic - the European Center for Art in Bialystok.Opery i filharmonie ciƒÖgle popularne.

The software package runs on both Windows and Linux. 1 DOF Pendulum with spring-damper Adams simulation with input vibration  Capabilities  Adams has a full graphical user interface to model the entire mechanical assembly in a single window. Graphical Computer-aided design tools are used to insert a model of a mechanical system in three-dimensional space or import geometry files such as STEP or IGS. Joints can be added between any two bodies to constrain their motion. Variety of inputs such as velocities, forces, and initial conditions can be added to the system. Adams simulates the behavior of the system over time and can animate its motion and compute properties such as accelerations, forces, etc. The system can include further complicated dynamic elements like springs, friction, flexible bodies, contact between bodies. The software also provides extra CAE tools such as design exploration and optimization based on selected paramters. The inputs and outputs of the simulation can be interfaced with Simulink for applications such as control.  Applications  The Adams software package is used both in academic research and engineering.

Price is an American physicist and professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School as well as the director of PET Pharmacokinetic Modeling at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center at Massachusetts General Hospital. Price is a leader in the study and applications of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) and led the first fully quantitative pharmacokinetic evaluations of Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB), one of the most widely used PET ligands for imaging amyloid beta plaques. As a principal investigator at Harvard and continuing collaborator with the University of Pittsburgh, Price innovates novel PET methods for imaging biological markers of health and disease such as glucose metabolism, protein expression, neurotransmitter system function, and tau and amyloid beta plaque burden.  Early life and education  Price attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison for her undergraduate degree. She majored in physics and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in 1982. Upon completion of her bachelors, Price stayed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison to pursue her Master‚Äôs in Medical Physics. She worked in the Radiation Calibration Service as a project specialist during her Master‚Äôs where she explored the efficacy of diode dosimeters in the detection of radiation in mailed radiotherapy. Upon completion of her Master‚Äôs in 1985, Price worked as Physics Research Assistant in the Diagnostic Radiology Department at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. She led studies to assess the level of radiation exposure to the fetus from multislice CT scans. Price then pursued her graduate studies at Johns Hopkins University within the School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. She focused her research in Environmental Health Sciences and Radiation Health Sciences. Towards the end of her graduate degree in 1990, Price began working with Marc A. Feldman and J. James Frost in the Department of Radiology in Johns Hopkins School of Medicine where she began to quantify and measure kinetics of various receptors in the human and non-human primate brain. She quantified opiate receptor concentrations and affinity in the human brain using Diprenorphine and PET imaging and then used Single Photon Emission Tomography to measure Benzodiazepine receptor concentration and affinity in the brains of non-human primates. For her thesis work, she used a novel approach to measure benzodiazepine receptor concentration combining tracer kinetic modeling of flumazenil in PET imaging. Price then completed her postdoctoral work at the National Institutes of Health in the Department of PET and Nuclear Medicine where she pioneered a novel method to reduce the transmission noise in 18F-FDG cardiac emission images. Her innovative method uses a model that sharpens the peaks of the measured attenuation histograms of the images to minimize noise while preventing too much smoothing of the data.  Career and research  Following her postdoctoral training, Price was recruited to the University of Pittsburgh in 1994 as a physicist and Assistant Professor in the PET Facility and Department of Radiology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. In 2002, Price was promoted to Associate Professor and became the Director of PET Imaging, Methodology, and Statistics Core at the University of Pittsburgh, a position she held until 2016. In 2010, she became a Full Professor in the Department of Radiology and in 2013, became a Full Professor in the Department of Biostatistics. During her 14 year tenure, she was awarded over 40 National Institutes of Health grants to foster the investigation of the pharmacokinetic properties of PET ligands for use in human disease diagnosis and health assessment. In 2016, Price became a Visiting Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School‚Äôs Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging as well as an Investigator in the Department of Radiology at the Massachusetts General Hospital. She was also appointed Director of PET Pharmacokinetic Modeling at the Massachusetts General Hospital/Health Sciences Technology Martinos Center in Boston. As of 2018, Price began collaborating with and serving as a Senior Research Scientist in the Massachusetts Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Research Center. She uses her expertise in PET imaging to guide a team towards establishing novel methods to diagnosis AD through imaging of Tau and Amyloid Beta plaque deposits. She continues to collaborate with her previous institutions including the Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Pittsburgh. Price is also an associate editor of the Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, a leading journal in the field. Price is also the Principal Investigator of the Price Lab at Harvard Medical School where she focuses on innovating and improving PET imaging methods for early diagnosis of human disease. She leads a variety of projects such as applying PET imaging to assess epigenetic changes in Huntington‚Äôs Disease and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease and developing novel diagnostic methods to measure pathological Tau deposition in the human brain through PET imaging. Her research also addresses race-based differences in disease as she explores the mechanisms of altered peripheral glucose uptake in African American women. She also uses PET imaging to assess the outcomes of meditation on chronic pain and migraines by tracking neuroinflammation using novel PET ligands. = Early evaluation of PiB in PET imaging = While at the University of Pittsburgh, Price played an integral role in the kinetic evaluation of the Pittsburgh Compound B, a radioactive analog of thioflavin T, and its use in imaging amyloid beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. At the time that Price began working at Pittsburgh, the interest in using PET imaging for diagnosis of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease was just beginning to rise. Price‚Äôs colleagues William E. Klunk and Chester A. Mathis developed a novel PET ligand, which was soon called Pittsburgh compound-B (PIB), which bound to neuritic or amyloid beta plaques, thus effectively allowing observation of plaque load in the brain. When Price joined the faculty, she created a quantitative imaging method to measure the load of amyloid beta plaques in the brain based on PIB signal. She found that PIB retention was a stable and valid marker of AD which was a critical first step in the field of using this method for diagnosis and therapeutic guidance for patients with AD. Price later helped to discover that PIB is selective to human plaques and cannot be used to assess plaque deposition in mouse models. Price also led several follow-up studies to confirm the optimal time window and experimental designs for use of PIB in diagnosis of AD. = Tau imaging = After pioneering the use of PET imaging in the tracking and assessment of amyloid beta burden in the brains of AD patients, Price sought to use PET imaging to observe the Tau burden in AD patients as Tau deposition has been shown to be associated with neurodegeneration in various diseases. Price helped to improve the existing tools for PET imaging Tau by first debunking the idea that the common Tau PET ligand [F-18]AV-1451 aberrantly bind the choroid plexus leading to false positives. Price and her team explored the possible presence of tau tangles in the epithelial cells that line the choroid plexus and found that in fact they do contain tangles and they are labelled by tau antibodies as well. Price‚Äôs findings suggest that the previous reports of off target binding of [F-18]AV-1451 are actually just binding to brain boarder cells that are suffering from AD pathology. In a 2019 paper, Price explored sex differences in tau deposition using the flortaucipir F18 PET ligand and they found that women had higher early tau deposition compared to men on an AD trajectory. = Vascular risk factors in brain disease = In addition to neurodegeneration, Price was a founding researcher in the investigation of vascular abnormalities in psychiatric disease using PET imaging. Since PET imaging enables analysis of cerebral physiology, Price led a study exploring whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) to the brain is reduced in aging. Price and her team found that when they corrected for the dilution effect of age-related atrophy, they did not observed a decrease in CBF and future studies should be sure to account for dilution effects to improving the accuracy of brain measurements. Price has also explored changes in CBF in women with bulimia nervosa and found that there was an inverse relationship between the length of recovery and the level of CBF suggesting that CBF might be a predictor of recovery.

History  The club was established on 14 November 1967 at a meeting at the Evans Oval Soccer Hall by former pupils at the Cardiff High school. They first began playing football in 1968 entering a team in the Newcastle Australian Football League Reserve grade competition. In their first season they had finished runners up, losing the Grand Final by just one point. After winning the premiership the following year in 1969, Cardiff was added to the league's First Grade competition. At the time the club was playing on a field which is now known today as McDonald Jones Stadium. Cardiff improved quickly within the First Grade competition, making their first Grand Final in 1974 despite losing to RAAF. In 1978 the Hawks moved to their new home ground of Maneela Park in Glendale. Under the coaching of former Glenelg footballer Neil Davis, Cardiff won their first NAFL First Grade premiership over Newcastle City, and went on to win the following year in 1980 after lasting the entire season undefeated. Cardiff finished runners up in the following 1981 and 1982 seasons, losing both Grand Finals to Newcastle City and Western Suburbs. However, this would see a premiership drought lasting for 18 years until 1998 when a year after they finished runners up again, this time to Nelson Bay, they capped off another undefeated season to win the premiership. After both the Newcastle and Central Coast leagues merged to form the Black Diamond Australian Football League in 2000, Cardiff were seen as one of the more stronger clubs inn the league early on, despite losing both the 2000 and 2001 Grand Finals to Terrigal-Avoca and West Newcastle-Wallsend. The Hawks won the 2002 premiership and went on to win the 2004, 2005 and 2006 flags but after 2007 saw a Grand Final losing streak that lasted from 2008 to 2012. 2006 saw the club lose Maneela Park, which resulted in seniors playing at Bill Elliott Oval and juniors at Hillsborough Oval. Cardiff's most recent Grand Final appearance was in 2017 where they lost to Terrigal-Avoca by 9 points. Cardiff fielded their first Women's team in 2016 that finished their inaugural season 4th with 11 wins and 4 losses. Cardiff has also produced one Australian Football League player, Isaac Heeney (Sydney Swans).

Biography Guisan was born in Avenches, Switzerland. In 1769, he moved to Suriname to work for Nicolaas Guisan, his uncle, who owned the plantation La Libert√©. During 1772 and 1773, sugar and coffee prices were very low, and business was bad. Guisan was put in charge of the plantation Accaribo, and managed to turn the plantation into a profitable business. In 1777, Guisan came to the attention of Pierre-Victor Malouet, who was on a mission by the French government to Suriname to discuss the 200 Maroons that had fled to French Guiana.. Malouet persauded Guisan to improve and develop agriculture on the lowlands of French Guiana, and appointed him captain of the colonial troops. Guisan started to work on the area around Kaw, began poldering the banks of the Approuague and Kaw River, and supervised the digging of the Roy and Torcy canals. His efforts transformed the area into a flourishing agricultural region. Guisan also constructed the first sugar factory in the colony. His ambitious plans for the colony, and complaints about the unhealthy living conditions were not well received. Guisan's opposition to Governor Lescalier, lead to his dismissal, and he left French Guiana for Switzerland in July 1791. Back in Avenches, he held some minor functions in the local government, started to write his autobiography, and a book about poldering marshes.

Its repertoire consists mainly of puppetry-based adaptations of international literature, as well as children's entertainment. History Bialystok Puppet Theatre's history began in 1937, when it was founded as a small amateur theater by puppeteers Helena Pacewicz and Piotr Sawicki.Historia teatru It was incarnated in its current form in 1953, when the Communist government's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage granted it a subsidy and the status of a professional stage. Nationalization followed in 1960, followed by an increase in government investment in the theatre. In 1972, a still-extant stage for adult puppet theatre was built. This was the first-ever such stage in Poland. An Actor Study for training in puppetry was founded shortly thereafter in 1974; this study ultimately became the Puppetry Department of the Aleksander Zelwerowicz National Academy of Dramatic Art in Warsaw. Between 1975 and 1979, a permanent building was erected at 1 Kalinowskiego St. The Bialystok Puppet Theatre is still housed in this building today. This building today houses three stages: a large stage, which seats 200, a small stage, which seats 100, and a rehearsal room, which seats 40. Notable former puppeteers of the Bialystok Puppet Theater include Jan Wilkowski, Krzysztof Rau, and Piotr Tomaszuk. Cultural Impact Bialystok Puppet Theatre organized the All-Poland Competition of Puppet Theatre Soloists, Poland's first-ever nationwide solo puppeteer competition, in 1972, and subsequently ran it as a biennial event. In 1977, the theatre began permitting non-Polish entrants and restyled the event as the International Festival of Puppeteers, leading to the participation of entrants from across Europe, most notably German puppeteer Albrecht Roser. Recent theatre directors have also permitted non-Polish puppeteers to perform directly at the Bialystok. In the 1990s, the BPT, under the lead of playwright Wojciech Szelachowski, helped further modernize Polish puppet theatre by launching postmodernist, sometimes sans-puppet performances, several of which were inspired by the post-WW1 Dada art movement.

Biography  Susan Varga is one of the \\"most accomplished of Australia's second-generation, post-Holocaust autobiographers\\". Susan Varga is a Holocaust survivor who came to Australia at the age of five with her mother, stepfather and sister in 1948. Her biological father died in a Nazi Labour camp during the German occupation of Hungary in WWII. After the war her mother married a survivor who had lost his wife and two sons at Auschwitz. The family emigrated to Australia in 1949. Varga's stepfather was a successful businessman who started in the clothing business in Sydney. Married and divorced, Varga lives with her partner and writer Anne Coombs in the Southern Highlands of NSW. Varga has written fiction, non-fiction and articles for newspapers and magazines.  Education  Varga obtained a MA from the University of Sydney and later a law degree from the University of New South Wales.  Philanthropy  After World War II Varga's parents built a new life in their adopted country. They started a clothing business out of a factory which they named Becher. When their daughter chose to invest her inheritance in a foundation to help those who, like her own family, have been forced into asylum, she and her partner Anne Coombs named it Becher. Together with Anne Coombs and Helen McCue, Varga founded Rural Australians for Refugees (RAR) in 2001. In 2020 there are branches across Australia supporting and advocating for refugees and people seeking asylum.  Activism  In 1974 Varga was one of a group of volunteers including Kay Ferrington, Joan Killorn, Betty Pybus and Edith Warburton who set up the Bonnie Women's Refuge at 260 Burns Road, Bonnyrigg in Sydney's South West. Nola Cooper, Christine Sykes and Diane Powell also played a crucial role. It was called Bonny's in line with the practice of naming women's refuges after women. The first women's refuge in New South Wales was called Elsie Refuge. Bonnie Support Services was launched in 2014 on the 40th anniversary of the setting up of the Bonnie Women's Refuge. Varga wrote a poem, \\"Refuge\\", for the occasion. It concludes with the words, \\"By Women, For Women\\".

Atmanirbhar Bharat does not mean \\"self- containment\\", \\"isolating away from the world\\" or being \\"protectionist\\". The first mention of this came in the form of the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan' or 'Self-Reliant India Mission' during the announcement of India's COVID‚Äì19 pandemic related economic package on 12 May 2020. The five pillars of ‚ÄòAtmanirbhar Bharat‚Äô are stated as economy, infrastructure, technology-driven systems, vibrant demography and demand.  Definition  Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said \\"Aatmanirbhar Bharat is not about being self-contained or being closed to the world, it is about being self-sustaining and self- generating. We will pursue policies that promote efficiency, equity and resilience.\\" Its proponents have said that this self-reliant policy does not aim to be protectionist in nature; the Finance Minister said, \\"self-reliant India does not mean cutting off from rest of the world\\". The law and IT minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad, said that self-reliance does \\"not mean isolating away from the world. Foreign direct investment is welcome, technology is welcome [...] self-reliant India... translates to being a bigger and more important part of the global economy.\\" = Self-reliance or Self- sufficiency = According to Indian Express, \\"Atmanirbhar\\" can be understood as either \\"self-reliance\\" or as \\"self-sufficiency\\". The confusion, according to the Express started on 12 May itself, the day the phrase was first announced, Swaminathan Aiyar says the same, \\"atmanirbhar\\" can be translated as both self-reliance and self-sufficiency. India in the 1960s-70s tried self- sufficiency and it didn't work out. Aiyer says that \\"to go back to self- sufficiency again appears to be going in the wrong direction.\\" In May, in an article, Livemint translated the term as \\"self-sufficiency\\". Initiatives As part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, numerous government decisions have taken place such as changing the definition of MSMEs, boosting scope for private participation in numerous sectors, increasing FDI in the defence sector; and the vision has found support in many sectors such as the solar manufacturers sector. Examples of initiatives towards self-reliance: * The growth of India's personal protective equipment (PPE) sector from zero before March, to 4,50,000 pieces a day by the beginning of July, is considered as a fine example of a self-reliant India. The PPE industry in India has become a in three months, the second largest after China. * The largest fund in the country worth was setup by the IIT Alumni Council with the aim of supporting the mission towards self-reliance. * India's own 'Made in India' 5G network was announced in July 2020 by Reliance Jio. Mukesh Ambani announced in mid- July \\"Jio has created a complete 5G solution from scratch, that will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India, using 100 per cent homegrown technologies and solutions\\". In September 2020, Tech Mahindra announced that they have \\"the capability to build and run an entire 4G or 5G network in India [...] We have done that already.\\" * In August 2020, the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh announced that the Defence Ministry is \\"now ready for a big push to Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative\\" by imposing an \\"import embargo on 101 items\\" in a staged manner over a period of 5 years. * Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers, D V Sadananda Gowda, in September 2020, said that \\"India will be self-reliant in fertiliser production by 2023\\". * Three farm bills provides the legal framework to give the farmers the right to choose the price and people to whom they want to sell. * Two important documents by Ministry of Defence(MoD) that will have a far-reaching impact in Defence Industry of India and Aerospace industry, first is Defence Production and Export Promotion Policy(DPEPP 2020) while the second is the Defence Acquisition Procedure(DAP).  Slogans  Slogans initiated under Atmanirbhar Bharat include 'vocal for local', 'local for global' and 'make for world'. = Vocal for local = Not only should products be 'made in India', but the promotion of those products should take place so as to make those products competitive. During the Independence Day speech in 2020, Prime Minister Modi said that \\"The mindset of free India should be 'vocal for local'. We should appreciate our local products, if we don't do this then our products will not get the opportunity to do better and will not get encouraged.\\" Amul Managing Director RS Sodhi explained that the phrase vocal‚Äìfor‚Äìlocal \\"meant that products be made competitive vis-a-vis global brands\\" and that \\"it didn‚Äôt mean that one must only buy products that have a logo 'made in India' on it.\\" An extension of this slogan is 'local for global', that local products in India should have global appeal and reach. = Make for the world = Prime Minister Modi, during the 2020 Independence speech, said that 'make for world' should go hand in hand with 'make in India' and that the slogan 'make for world' should be a key slogan like 'make in India' is. A variation of the slogan is \\"Make in India for the world\\".  Commentary  Atmanirbhar Bharat has been called by some as a re-packaged version of the Make in India movement using new taglines such as 'Vocal for Local'. Other opposition members spoke about how India had enacted policies and built companies since its creation to make India self- reliant - SAIL for steel production, IIT for domestic engineers, AIIMS for medical science, DRDO for defence research, HAL for aviation, ISRO for space, CCL, NTPC and GAIL in the area of energy; criticizing the advertising tactics. Some have re-phrased it to \\"Fend For Yourself\\" Campaign. Calls for India to boycott Chinese products (and promote an Atmanirbhar Bharat instead), are practically difficult in the short term for India as India imports $75 billion worth of goods every year from China, to the extent that parts of Indian industry are dependent on China. Following the Galwan Valley skirmish on 15 June 2020 in which around 40 Chinese soldiers and 20 Indian soldiers died, Swadeshi Jagaran Manch said that if the government was serious about making India self-reliant, Chinese companies should not be given projects such as the Delhi-Meerut RRTS. Results of the boycott China movement started showing in early August, with Government of China's customs data showing that Chinese exports to India had fallen by 25% as compared to the same period in 2019.

After the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Sinclair joined the Royal Engineers in 1948. He served in Korea during the aftermath of the Korean War and was quickly appointed adjutant of his regiment. Sinclair served as adjutant of the British garrison on Kiritimati for the Operation Grapple thermonuclear weapon tests. From 1969 he was Commander Royal Engineers Near East Land Forces, based at the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia and was responsible for recovering buildings from a British training base abandoned in the aftermath of the 1969 Libyan coup d'√©tat. Sinclair served as head of the general staff of I Corps, British Army of the Rhine in the late 1970s. He was Engineer in Chief (Army) from 1980 to 1983. During this time Sinclair served on the Falkland Islands in the aftermath of the 1982 war and was responsible for persuading the government to construct a new runway (that became RAF Mount Pleasant) rather than improving the existing Stanley airfield. Sinclair retired in 1983 but retained a connection to the military through honorary appointments with the Corps of Royal Engineers, the Airfield Damage Repair Squadrons, Royal Engineers (Volunteers) and the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps. In civilian life he worked for Tarmac Group on the construction of the Channel Tunnel and was a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers.  Early life and career  George Brian Sinclair was born in Shirley, Warwickshire, (now in the West Midlands) on 21 July 1928 to Blanche and Thomas Stoddart Sinclair (a civil engineer and businessman). He attended Christ's College, Finchley, and from 1945 the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst to train as a British Army officer. Whilst there he acquired the nickname \\"Gus\\" in unclear circumstance, but by which he became best known. Sinclair was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 21 October 1948 and spent the next two years in a training regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 October 1950 and given command of a troop of 25 Field Squadron, which was then a sub-unit of 27 Field Engineer Regiment with the British Army of the Rhine. Sinclair afterwards served intelligence and signals officer of the regiment. Sinclair was posted to Korea in 1953, though he questioned his orders as they had been sent after the Korean War had ended with a ceasefire. Upon arrival he found himself unexpected and surplus to requirements and, with no military tasks requiring his attention, was put to work designing a sewerage system for a civilian village. Sinclair found more regular employment after he was appointed adjutant of his unit, 28 Field Engineer Regiment, when the previous incumbent was dismissed for unsuitable behaviour. Sinclair was promoted to captain on 21 October 1954 and left Korea the following year.  Operation Grapple  Royal Engineers constructing a runway at Kiritimati, November 1956 In 1956 Sinclair was appointed a staff officer to Major-General John Woollett, the chief engineer of Operation Grapple, the first attempted detonation of a British-made thermonuclear weapon (hydrogen bomb). In this role he developed the British facilities on the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Sinclair supervised construction of a modern airfield and air-conditioned buildings to be used to construct and store the bombs. The first series of tests in May and June failed to reach the key megaton threshold and subsequent tests were relocated north to Kiritimati. Sinclair was sent to the new test location as adjutant of the Royal Engineer regiment supporting the tests . He quickly entered into a dispute with the Ministry of Defence (MoD), whose orders required him to arrange for the island's entire coastline to be patrolled to prevent the landing of Soviet spies. Sinclair, whose men were mainly engineers and technicians, requested that the MoD send five infantry battalions to carry out the security role. The MoD disputed this and dispatched a Royal Air Force group captain to investigate; this officer agreed with Sinclair's assessment and the patrol orders were subsequently rescinded. Operation Grapple delivered a megaton- level explosion in November. Sinclair directly witnessed a number of nuclear tests, and twenty years later was asked to provide evidence in the case of a sergeant who died from leukaemia. The sergeant's widow claimed he had contracted the cancer as a result of his official duty, photographing the tests. Sinclair supported the widow and provided evidence that the sergeant had been in close proximity to the test sites. He maintained this support despite pressure to drop the matter from a permanent under-secretary at the MoD. Senior roles  Sinclair was promoted to major on 21 October 1961 and to lieutenant colonel 30 June 1967. In 1969 he was appointed Commander Royal Engineers Near East Land Forces, based at the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, and was soon arguing against orders issued by the MoD. Following the September 1969 Libyan coup d'√©tat in which King Idris was deposed by Colonel Gaddafi, the ministry issued orders to abandon a base in the Libyan desert, intended for use in training British forces. Sinclair argued that the buildings erected at the site were valuable and in need on other British bases. He flew to the site with Air Marshal Denis Smallwood, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Near East Air Force, and his subsequent report persuaded the MoD to authorise the recovery of 85 Twynham huts, 2 aircraft hangars and a number of storage sheds. Sinclair returned from Cyprus in 1971. Sinclair was promoted colonel on 30 June 1972 and by 1 January 1975, when he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1975 New Year Honours, held a position at the MoD. He was afterwards posted as head of the general staff at the headquarters of I Corps, stationed in Germany with the British Army of the Rhine. Sinclair was promoted to brigadier on 30 June 1975 and the following year became commandant of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham. During this posting Sinclair was attacked by a mugger on Chatham Common and fought off his assailant. Sinclair was appointed Engineer in Chief (Army) on 1 July 1980 and granted the acting rank of major general. His rank was confirmed as substantive on 29 November 1980, with seniority backdated to 1 April 1980.  The Falklands and retirement  Map shows Port Stanley Airport and surrounding area. Sinclair played an important role in the reconstruction of the Falkland Islands after the 1982 war. He became known on the islands as \\"that Sapper brigadier who solves problems and gets things done\\" and was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 31 December 1982 in the 1983 New Year Honours. A key task was to get the runway at Stanley airfield repaired and improved to allow use by Phantom fighter jets for air defence. This would allow the Royal Navy's two aircraft carriers to return to home waters. British prime minister Margaret Thatcher was keen for the army to carry out the necessary works so that the money would come from the defence budget and not the government's general funds. Sinclair, under intense political pressure to find a solution, found that the necessary work could not take place while the runway was in use for other traffic. He recommended instead that a new runway be built elsewhere, though this would have required extensive resources from the Royal Engineers. This was not acceptable to the government and Sinclair came close to resigning. The January 1983 replacement of John Nott as defence secretary by Michael Heseltine changed the situation. Heseltine allowed a compromise solution: Sinclair would clear the runway of landmines and install metal matting to improve the surface. This allowed for use by the Phantoms of No. 23 Squadron RAF and Hercules transport aircraft within a month. Work on a replacement military airfield, RAF Mount Pleasant, began later in 1983 by civilian contractors. Sinclair was appointed to the honorary and ceremonial role of colonel commandant of the Corps of Royal Engineers on 25 March 1983. On 18 April his appointment as engineer in chief ended and he retired from the army on 13 June. After retirement Sinclair worked for the contractor Tarmac Group, including during the construction of the Channel Tunnel (1988‚Äì94). He was appointed honorary colonel of the Airfield Damage Repair Squadrons, Royal Engineers (Volunteers) of the Territorial Army on 1 May 1984. On 23 July 1988 Sinclair was appointed honorary colonel of the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, a unit manned by volunteer engineers from civilian industry who advised the British Army. His honorary appointment with the Airfield Damage Repair Squadrons ended on 30 November 1988; of the Corps of Royal Engineers on 26 March 1991 and of the renamed Engineer and Transport Staff Corps on 28 October 1993.  Personal life and other interests  Sinclair married Margaret Richardson from Armagh, Northern Ireland, in 1953; they had two sons and a daughter together. Margaret died in 2011. In retirement Sinclair lived at St Boswells in the Scottish Borders where he enjoyed walking. Sinclair was admitted as a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a dining and discussion group, in 1985. From 1990 to 2000 he served as a trustee of the Imperial War Museum and contributed to a documentary about Britain's nuclear programme. Sinclair also worked at the Staff College, Camberley where he organised battlefield tours for the students. On 1 March 1996 he was appointed deputy lieutenant for the county of Kent.Sinclair wrote The Staff Corps: The History of the Engineer and Logistic Staff Corps RE which was published by the Royal Engineers Museum in 2001. He collaborated with Colonel D.J. Hindle to enable the Staff Corps to publish a second edition in 2015 to mark their 150th anniversary. Sinclair died on 17 May 2020.

PEA is responsible for providing electricity in 74 provinces in Thailand‚Äîall except Bangkok, Samut Prakan, and Nonthaburi)‚Äîwhich are served by the Metropolitan Electricity Authority.  History  The first town electricity system installed outside Bangkok was in Nakhon Pathom City in 1930. In 1934, the Provincial Electricity Division was set up. After World War II, a royal decree replaced the division and formed the Provincial Electricity Organisation on 16 March 1954. The PEA was then established on 28 September 1960 by the Provincial Electricity Authority Act 1960. Following the Third National Social and Economic Developement Plan (1972-1975), and significantly increased electricity demand, the PEA saw rapid expansion throughout the provinces of Thailand. All provinces, districts and subdistricts in Thailand became electrified after fiscal year 1989.  Operations  PEA operates a total of 945 offices in the country, with its head office in Bangkok.

It is one of his peasant stories. The theme is related to the lidelsens h√∏gskole 'college of suffering', a concept that Bj√∏rnson developed when he read texts by the German preacher Ludwig Hofacker in the summer of 1859. The protagonist Thord √òveraas goes from prosperity and pride through deep despair to humility. Plot Thord √òveraas is a rich and prosperous farmer, one of the most powerful men in his community. One day he stands in the priest's office and says he wants his son baptized. The baptism is scheduled for the coming Saturday at twelve o'clock. Sixteen years later, Thord comes to the priest's living room, and asks to have his son confirmed. He will not pay the priest until he makes sure that his son is first in line. Then eight years go by and Thord stands in the priest's office with several other men from the village. The son is to marry Karen Storlien, the village's richest girl. He pays three dollars, although the priest says he should receive only one. All these times Thord has talked to the priest, he has always asked \\"Is there anything else?\\", and every time Thord replies \\"Otherwise there is nothing.\\" Fourteen days later, the unthinkable happens to Thord. One day they are out rowing and talking about the wedding, and then the son falls out of the boat, goes stiff, and drowns. The father looks for three days and three nights for his dead son. On the morning of the third day, he finds his son's body and carries him up the slopes back to his farm. An entire year passes. One autumn evening, the priest hears someone walking outside the front room, and there stands Thord. He says he has sold his farm and wants to donate half the money for a grant in his son's name. The priest says \\"Now I think your son has finally blessed you.\\" \\"Yes, now I think so too,\\" replies Thord.

It is the first automated passenger train stock in Australia as well as the first single-deck set to operate in Sydney since the withdrawal of single deck trains on the Sydney Trains network in the 1990s. A total of 176 carriages, making up 22 6-car sets, entered service in 2019 with the opening of the Metro Northwest line, consisting of 13 stations (8 completely new, and 5 previously operated by Sydney Trains) between Tallawong and Chatswood. 23 more sets will be rolled out for the Metro City & Southwest Line commencing service in 2024, expanding the Metropolis fleet to 45 sets.  Design  Each single-deck train features two dedicated areas for prams, luggage and bicycles. There are three doorways per side per carriage and no internal gangway doors between the carriages. In a 6-car configuration the trains have a seating capacity of 378 people, with a total capacity of 1,100. The trains utilise Alstom's trademark Urbalis 400 Grade-of-Automation signalling system that ensures trains are capable of operating automatically at all times including door closing, obstacle detection and emergency situations. The trains feature longitudinal 'bench-style' seating per carriage (similar to most metro rapid-transit/subway trains), with distinctly coloured seats for priority and disabled passengers. Seats in wheelchair spaces can fold up in order to fit prams and wheelchairs. Above the doorways, a light flashes green if the doors are open, and red if the doors are closed. Much like the M set, H set, A & B sets and Hunter railcar sets, the Metropolis sets include multiple CCTV cameras (38 per train), internal Passenger Information Display (PID) screens and Digital Voice Announcements capable of conveying basic and essential information. Each set uses full-colour LCD PIDS screens which flash blue with the name of the next station, along with icons for available transport mode interchanges (such as trains, buses and/or light rail). The sets are also fitted with air conditioning and Emergency Help Points, as with other existing Sydney Trains and NSW TrainLink sets. An exclusive feature of the Metropolis sets is the inclusion of USB charging ports inside the carriages. The Metropolis sets are operated via a computer control centre based at Rouse Hill. In the event the system is otherwise unable to operate the train, an engineer can manually take over the train's functions.  History  Prior to the introduction of services, a full-scale model of the new train was built for use on public display, including at the annual Sydney Royal Easter Show. It consisted of the front carriage, including its distinctive nose. It was approximately 75% of the length of the final design for the new carriages, having two doors instead of three. The sets were manufactured at Alstom's rolling stock facility in India, with the first six-car Sydney Metro train arriving in Rouse Hill on 26 September 2017 to undergo testing in the following months. In February 2018, dynamic testing on the first of the trainsets began. Testing was done on brakes, passenger information displays, lighting and door operation. In November 2019, MTS was awarded a 10-year contract to operate the rolling stock on the metro network. To commemorate the new contract, 23 additional Metropolis sets were ordered, bringing the total fleet to 45 sets (with extensions to 8 cars likely to happen if sufficient demand warrants it) in time by the time the City & Southwest services commence. The rolling stock officially entered service on 26 May 2019 on the Metro Northwest line from Tallawong to Chatswood. In 2024, they will also serve City & Southwest line, with new fully underground metro-only City stations at Crows Nest, Victoria Cross, Barangaroo, Pitt Street and Waterloo, as well as new underground metro platforms at Martin Place and Central. This line will then continue from Sydenham to Bankstown via the existing T3 Bankstown Line corridor, which will be progressively converted to serve the new system. The fleet will grow to 45 sets by the time this section of the Sydney Metro network starts service.

Biography Born Annie Harris in Goole, Yorkshire in 1889 to musician John Harris, Greaves married shipbroker Somerton Greaves when she was 20. They had two sons, Eric and Raymond. Sometime after the children were born, Greaves and her husband were no longer living together. His business had suffered badly due to the war. Although in 1911 Greaves worked as a confectioner, by 1925 she was a quarry manager and that year became the first woman to be a member of the Institute of Quarry Managers (now the Institute of Quarrying). The land Greaves quarried was leased and in 1926 she had 9,130 acres of land at Weeland, Hensall, North Yorkshire. It was leased from Baron Deramore and the Church Commissioners for fifty pounds a year. Greaves ran a quarrying company called Weeland Sand Company. It became a Limited company in 1933. The produce was used in road-building industry and was known as ‚ÄòAddingham Edge Grit‚Äô in The British Geological Survey which described it. Greaves closed that company in 1948 but another called Weeland Sand Co. (Leeds) Ltd. continued to trade. A second business which Greaves established in 1934, with her brother, Charles Harris, CF Harris Ltd. also continued to trade. This was initially also a quarry company but it moved into transport. Greaves either retired from the business in about 1948 or died. Greaves created an artificial stone which she called \\" Betna Cast Stone\\", as it was made using a combination of crushed stone and cement. Artificial stone on the market was often coated with a layer of stone over a cement block. Greaves marketed her product on the grounds that it was superior, as the outer layer could not simply wear off or be damaged. Use of this stone allowed it to be created in any shape needed thus eliminating the need for stone masons who were in short supply after the First World War. Greaves conducted the experimentation necessary to identify the best recipe for the stone.
