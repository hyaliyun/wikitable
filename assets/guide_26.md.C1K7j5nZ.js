History It originated as \\"Neil's Sporting Goods\\" in the 1960s. Initially started to equip little league and school athletic teams, the company's business greatly increased in the 1970s and 1980s. Nine stores in the Georgia cities of Albany, Columbus, and LaGrange and the Alabama cities of Phenix City and Auburn allowed The Game to become one of the most important sports apparel companies in the Southeastern United States. The business grew rapidly during the 1970s and early 80‚Äôs until Neil had built a small chain of 9 sporting good stores covering Phenix City, AL; Auburn, AL; Columbus, GA; Albany, GA; and LaGrange, GA. The business grew steadily until he had become one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the southeast. Neil's Sport Shops grew into multiple divisions, which included a retail segment, team sales, concessions and military. By expanding his business into multiple lines, Neil began to see the growth potential that the sporting goods market had to offer. By 1984, the business had grown significantly and Neil began searching for something opportunities to expand. He sold his company to the W.C. Bradley Company in Columbus, GA and stayed on as an officer. The separate divisions of Neil‚Äôs Sport Shops were eventually sold to other buyers. One of the buyers was Neil‚Äôs older brother Bill who bought the concession business and managed the concession sales for the majority of the Southeastern Conference Schools. Neil saw the growth that was happening in the concession sales as well as the retail side of the sporting goods business. He had been overseas and seen the opportunity to import products for his stores and soon decided to import sporting goods apparel on his own to sell to the different colleges. In 1986, Neil formed The Game and the W.C. Bradley Company agreed to stay involved as a financial partner. The primary focus of The Game was to provide headwear designs for Colleges across the country. This would include everything from the initial design of the caps to the sales force that would call on the individual schools. Neil‚Äôs younger brother Phil was an independent salesman for Nike at this time and also agreed to represent The Game. Soon afterwards, Phil helped develop a national sales force for The Game through his contacts with other salesmen throughout the country. Within a matter of months, The Game had its first product designs and a national sales force in place to sell it. All of this happened at a time when the demand for college apparel was about to skyrocket. The combination of logo designs and headwear was an instant success in the college markets. Designs such as ‚ÄúThe Bar‚Äú helped propel the growth of the company not only in the Southeast, but also throughout the country. Students and fans of colleges began to recognize the red, white and blue ‚ÄúG‚Äù logo on the back of their caps and started seeking out these products on a regular basis. A natural progression for The Game was their move from a college only program into the professional sports programs such as Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Hockey League and the National Basketball Association. The addition of these properties also propelled the growth of The Game during a time in which college and professional sports saw phenomenal growth. Soon, The Game could be found not only in college bookstores, but also in major league sporting event venues and in major retailers all across the country. The Game also moved into expanding their apparel line by offering complementary products to the headwear such as sweatshirts, sweatpants, shorts, shirts, etc. All of this growth occurred during the period of 1987 to 1991, which saw The Game go from $0 sales in 1986 and a small warehouse to annual sales of over $80 million and a manufacturing facility. When Neil originally started The Game in 1986 and brought in the W.C. Bradley Company as his partner, he had a 5-year agreement with them as President of the company. When it came time for him to renew his contract in 1992, he opted to not renew the contract and ‚Äúslow down‚Äù for a while. At this point, The Game was managed by the W.C. Bradley Company and was eventually sold to Russell Athletic in 1993. As Neil began winding down his responsibilities at The Game, friend and founder of Realtree Outdoor Products, Bill Jordan introduced Neil to Tommy Allison who was the cousin and business manager for NASCAR driver Davey Allison. Davey and Tommy were looking for someone to help them with upgrading their licensed merchandise, which was primarily sold at NASCAR races. Over the next few months, Neil, Tommy, Davey and Bill talked and discussed the many opportunities available within NASCAR. By January 1993, Neil had decided retirement was not for him and formed A-Star promotions. The primary purpose of A-Star was to design, manage and sell all of the merchandise for the Davey Allison / Texaco Havoline racing team. This included everything from apparel to bumper stickers and miscellaneous souvenirs. The combination of Neil‚Äôs experience in importing merchandise, Davey‚Äôs success and fan following in NASCAR and the business management of Tommy Allison and Bill Jordan proved to be an instant success. When Davey‚Äôs merchandise began to show up at the races, other drivers and teams wanted to know where they could also get merchandise. The idea to form a separate company was born. As business began booming for A-Star, Davey Allison was killed in a helicopter accident at Talladega Superspeedway. Although this ended what began as a strong start for A-Star, it was also the catalyst for forming Kudzu which became the company that began designing, importing and selling headwear and jackets to NASCAR teams just as The Game had done for college and professional sports. For the formation of Kudzu, Neil teamed with Tommy Allison, Neil‚Äôs brother Phil and Neil‚Äôs son Jeff. From 1993 through 1998 several key events occurred. First, the W.C. Bradley Company sold The Game to Russell Athletic. This was a period marked by baseball strikes, reorganization of the NFL and many new headwear companies focusing on gaining market share in the college arena. Second, NASCAR experienced its greatest growth years with the addition of new racetracks, drivers becoming household names and most races being covered on national television networks. Kudzu‚Äôs business also grew exponentially as the company penetrated the majority of all of the leading NASCAR Winston Cup drivers and teams with their products. This also opened up the ability to work with major corporate sponsors on their apparel programs as well. Neil still longed to be back in the college market with The Game and his original sales force. He would not have to wait long. In 1998, Neil was contacted by Russell Athletic wanting to know if he would be interested in purchasing The Game. By October 1998, a deal was completed and The Game was back with its original owners once again. Since then, Neil, Tommy, Phil, Jeff and the W.C. Bradley Company have been restoring the brand to the prominence it once enjoyed in the college markets. Today, many of the same representatives that began selling The Game products in 1986 are still selling them today. In 2008, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball signed a contract to outfit all eight of its teams with game and batting practice caps produced by The Game. These caps feature The Game's logo in team-specific colors.

South Africa is one of the world's leading cricket-playing nations, and is one of 12 countries sanctioned by the International Cricket Council (ICC) to play Test Cricket. It also hosted the 2003 Cricket World Cup and the inaugural World Twenty20 in 2007..  History  Cricket in South Africa was established by the British, and the first tour by a side from England took place in 1888‚Äì89. Here South Africa played its first Test match (against touring England at Port Elizabeth), becoming the third test nation. In 1970, the ICC voted to suspend South Africa from international Cricket indefinitely because of its government's policy of apartheid, an overtly racist policy, which led them to play only against the white nations (England, Australia, New Zealand), and field only white players. This decision brought an abrupt end to the Test careers of hugely talented players such as Graeme Pollock, Peter Pollock, Barry Richards, Mike Procter and Eddie Barlow. It would also cause the emigration of future stars like Tony Greig, Allan Lamb and Robin Smith, who all played for England, and Kepler Wessels, who initially played for Australia, before returning to South Africa. The ICC reinstated South Africa as a Test nation in 1991 after the deconstruction of apartheid, and the team played its first sanctioned match since 1970 (and its first ever One-Day International) against India in Calcutta on 10 November 1991. In April 2019, Cricket South Africa announced changes to its domestic structure, including scrapping the T20 Challenge tournament, and increasing the six franchise teams to twelve provincial teams from May 2020.  Demographics  Cricket was traditionally popular among English-speaking whites, and the Asian/Indian community, though the latter were not able to compete in top level South African cricket in the Apartheid era. Since the end of the Apartheid era a higher proportion of white players have come from Afrikaans-speaking backgrounds like Lance Klusener, Kepler Wessels, Hansie Cronje, Allan Donald, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, AB de Villiers, Quinton de Kock, Francois du Plessis, Rilee Rossouw, Morne Morkel, Dale Steyn among others. Its popularity has grown markedly amongst other groups, though cricket remains the favourite sport for Coloured and Asian/Indian as well as people of English descent. This has other reasons, since cricket can be an expensive and is a typically middle class game, it does not appeal to blacks like football or rugby union does. However, a considerable number of blacks have played cricket for South Africa since the late 1990s, the most notable being Makhaya Ntini (who was the first black cricketer to play for South Africa), Lonwabo Tsotsobe, Aaron Phangiso, Kagiso Rabada, Andile Phehlukwayo, Temba Bavuma and Lungi Ngidi.  Governing body  Formerly known as the United Cricket Board of South Africa, Cricket South Africa is the governing body for professional and amateur cricket in South Africa. South Africa is a full member of the International Cricket Council and African Cricket Association with Test and One Day International status.  Domestic cricket Franchise cricket= South Africa's first-class competition began in 1889‚Äì1890 and was known as the Currie Cup. The competition was mainly contested by provincial sides until the 2003‚Äì2004 season, after which the domestic structure was revamped to introduce six franchise teams (the same applied to South Africa's primary List A and Twenty20 competitions). South Africa's three major domestic competitions are the Sunfoil Series (four day first class competition), the Momentum One Day Cup (List A one-day competition) and T20 Challenge (domestic Twenty20 competition). The T20 Challenge was stopped after the 2018‚Äì19 season, with the Mzansi Super League taking over as the main T20 tournament in the country. Generally encompassing more than one provincial associate team, six teams were formed to take part in the SuperSport Series, MTN Championships and Pro 20 Series competitions, starting from the 2004-2005 season. * Cape Cobras (Boland/Western Province) * Dolphins (KwaZulu-Natal/KZN Inland*) * Knights (Free State/Griqualand West) * Lions (Gauteng/North West) * Titans (Easterns/Northerns) * Warriors (Eastern Province/Border/SW Districts*) (*Since formation in 2006‚Äì2007) =CSA Provincial Competitions= In addition to the franchise tournaments, the 13 provincial teams compete in the CSA Provincial Competitions. These include a first-class (three-day), List A (50 over) and Twenty20 tournament. A representative side from neighbouring Namibia also competed from 2006 to 2018, but in October 2018 Namibia withdrew from South Africa's provincial competitions citing issues around costs and logistics. =Mzansi Super League= The Mzansi Super League, which began in 2018 as the new premier (T20) tournament in South Africa, is contested by six city-based franchise teams (distinct from the six franchises that compete in the premier first-class and List A tournaments). * Cape Town Blitz (Cape Town) * Durban Heat (Durban) * Jozi Stars (Johannesburg) * Nelson Mandela Bay Giants (Port Elizabeth) * Paarl Rocks (Paarl) * Tshwane Spartans (Centurion) =Africa T20 Cup= The Africa T20 Cup was an additional T20 tournament began in 2015 as a curtain-raiser to the 2015‚Äì16 South African domestic season.

Hosted by ABC journalist Bob Woodruff, the two-hour special explored what \\"a worst-case\\" future might look like if humans do not take action on current or impending problems that could threaten civilization. The problems addressed in the program include current climate change, overpopulation, and misuse of energy resources. The events following the life of a fictitious storyteller, \\"Lucy\\" (told through the use of motion comics, or limited animation), as she describes how the events affect her life. The program included predictions of a dystopian Earth in the years 2015, 2030, 2050, 2085, and 2100 by scientists, historians, social anthropologists, and economists, including Jared Diamond, Thomas Homer-Dixon, Peter Gleick, James Howard Kunstler, Heidi Cullen, Alex Steffen and Joseph Tainter. It ended with a quote from writer Alex Steffen, saying \\"Kids born today will see us navigate past the first greatest test of humanity, which is: can we actually be smart enough to live on a planet without destroying it?\\"http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alex_Steffen According to Executive Producer Michael Bicks, \\"this program was developed to show the worst-case scenario for human civilization. Again, we are not saying that these events will happen -- rather, that if we fail to seriously address the complex problems of climate change, resource depletion and overpopulation, they are much more likely to happen.\\" Plot Lucy is born on June 2, 2009 (changed to January 1, 2009 in subsequent airings), in the suburbs of Miami and is still alive in the year 2100. In 2015, negotiations on climate change action breaks down between the West and India/China as the former is unwilling to transfer clean technology to the latter, while Lucy's family moves out of the suburbs and into an apartment in Miami after chronic gas shortages. A few months later a powerful hurricane named Linda hits and levels much of Miami, killing thousands of people. She and her parents move to San Diego. She becomes an EMT and meets her husband, Josh, an engineer, during a protest against high water prices of California desalinated seawater in 2030 (Las Vegas had run dry). In 2050, they and their nineteen-year-old daughter Molly move to New York City by car, passing desperate Texans begging for rides north, which is refused by the trio. One pulls a gun on Molly, but others in the car/truck convoy point automatic weapons on the desperate man, who is forced to back off. While the others in the convoy make it to Canada, New York City is a marvel of clean power, clean transit, and community gardening. Josh sets to work building a flood barrier to hold back the ocean, but the CO2 warming unleashes trapped methane in the Arctic, which causes even faster, non-linear warming. An attempt to use sulfur dioxide as a last resort to cool the planet is called off when it is found to destroy the ozone layer. Lucy finds and helps quarantine and neutralize a strange new disease, and Molly moves upstate to an agricultural community. During a storm at high tide in 2075, Josh is killed while trying to fix a stuck gate, and New York City is flooded. Lucy refuses Molly's offer to live with her, her husband and son. Starving people among the rotting flood damage set the stage for the return of the disease Lucy saw, now called \\"Caspian Fever.\\" Caspian Fever soon becomes a pandemic and kills so many people on Earth that the human population starts shrinking, international trade stops and basic services begin to break down. Eventually the grid fails, modern technology stops working, and unrest follows (a plot contradiction as it was stated earlier that all technology in New York were self-sustaining), it dawns on Lucy and every American that there is no Federal response, no National Guard, no soldiers to keep order. Democracy and civilization at the national level have died in America. Lucy leaves the city with some friends and a dog in the 2080s, and eventually finds her daughter, now a widow like herself, and her grandson. Initially there is no communication with the outside world, until someone set up a two-way radio discovering former cities have become relatively advanced walled enclaves, while surrounded by masses of poverty. In 2100, Lucy ponders what strange advice to pass along to her grandson, now denied the education she took for granted, as she is the oldest person in the world. Development According to early ABC press releases, Earth 2100 was meant to be an \\"unprecedented television and Internet event.\\"Bagley, Katherine. \\"Earth 2100 Sizzles: ABC News‚Äôs two-hour special finally out of the frying pan, into the fire,\\" Columbia Journalism Review (June 5, 2009). The initial phase of the project was an online \\"crowdsourcing\\" project where viewers were encouraged to submit homemade videos imagining life in 2015, 2050, and 2100 in locations in Africa, Australia, United States, Europe, India, South America, and China. During the summer and fall of 2008, users began to post their submissions on the Earth 2100 website, and these videos were cobbled together into a Web-based narrative showing the worldwide consequences of population growth, resource depletion, and climate change. Multiple delays changed the scope of the project. Originally, Earth 2100 was set to air in September 2008. Then, partly due to personal reasons on the part of producer Michael Bicks, the program was rescheduled for Spring 2009. The final product was innovative in its use of the \\"motion comics\\" element and the \\"Lucy\\" story, but used very little user- generated footage. The Earth 2100 website, however, does feature selections of user-created videos representing the crisis points of 2015, 2050, and 2100. =Motion comic= Lucy's story was created with a limited animation technique using the talents of comic book creators, including Josh Neufeld, Sari Wilson, Joe Infurnari, George O'Connor, Tim Hamilton, and Leland Purvis.Marschall, Rick. \\"Comic Creators Play Big Role In Tonight‚Äôs ‚ÄòEarth 2100‚Äô Special,\\" SplashPage MTV (June 2, 2009). Their story was brought to \\"life\\" by the visual effects company Guerilla FX and lead animator John Bair.Loftus, Marc. \\"Guerilla FX Creates Animation for ABC's Earth 2100, Post Magazine (June 2, 2009). Reception The Earth 2100 premiere garnered an audience of nearly 3.7 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research. Response to the broadcast was mostly confined to online comment boards, which soon buzzed with debates about the validity of Earth 2100's predictions, and the show's overall effectiveness. Many commenters were annoyed by the show's apocalyptic, dystopian tone, accusing ABC of far-fetched fear-mongering. Thomas Fuller, writing for Examiner.com, accused ABC of portraying \\"science fiction\\" as fact, and stating that: ABC made sure to post annotated transcripts on the Earth 2100 website, outlining the scientific sources for the program's various predictions, scenarios, and statements.

Production background One short (# B-9) is frequently misidentified as Curly Howard's first appearance on film, as cited by historians. This is because it was mistaken for a 1932 short when Criterion Pictures acquired the shorts for television distribution in the early 1950s, and slapped a generic title card on all films in this series with a 1932 copyright notice. In fact, # B-9 was a 1934 Paramount release, and most likely filmed during a loan-out period for Howard from MGM, around the same time Ted Healy and the Three Stooges costarred in Myrt and Marge (1933) for Universal Studios. This is one of only two movies to portray a live-action Betty Boop. The other is a Paramount short film Musical Justice (1931), in which Mae Questel portrays Betty Boop.

Together with Dr. Ragheb Muftah he was instrumental in noting down and audio recording traditional Coptic church music in the years 1927 to 1936. The Laresol Society Ernest Newlandsmith founded the society in 1906 \\"to promote the higher realisation of the artistic vocation, looking at the matter from the standpoint of the religious life, and the definitely directed love and service of God and humanity\\".Ernest Newlandsmith, A Minstrel Friar (1927) p39 In 1908, financed by some two hundred followers he rented a farm near Kirdford in West Sussex called Brownings, but renamed \\"Kirdford Priory\\", where a chapel had recently been constructed for use by another fringe Christian sect. This was used for quiet religious retreats. In 1910 Brownings was no longer available and a mission hall was established in north Devon, attracting considerable crowds. By 1911 however Newlandsmith had moved on to Felpham near Bognor Regis, putting on concerts, a mystery play and lectures, with the stress of work leading to ill health in 1912. In 1914 another base was established at Seaford Priory near Newhaven in East Sussex. The beginning of the First World War caused 30,000 soldiers to be camped nearby, spoiling the tranquility and causing Newlandsmith to abandon Seaford. In 1917 he was working in conjunction with the Anglican National Mission in the Portsmouth area where he formed a ladies' Angelus Choir. After the war he preached in London and the Midlands, including Birmingham Cathedral. He expressed astonishment when his concerts and orationsErnest Newlandsmith, A Minstrel Friar (1927) p71 failed to spark a national religious revival. Friar In 1908 Newlandsmith took vows as a friar and henceforth dressed in a friar's cassockErnest Newlandsmith, A Minstrel Friar (1927) p41 The Holy Land In 1926 Brother Ernest, as he was known, took a new course when he travelled to the Middle East. On his way back from Palestine he visited Egypt where he soon became interested in the music of the Coptic Orthodox Church. He met Dr Raghib Muftah, a young agricultural engineer who shared his musical interest and wished to learn western musical notation to record the oral Coptic tradition. Living on Muftah's houseboat on the River Nile in front of El-Dobara palace, Newlandsmith, sitting crosslegged on the floor, notated the music performed by singers while Muftah recording them using paper tape recording equipment brought by Newlandsmith from England.Christians versus Muslims in Modern Egypt. The century long struggle for Coptic equality. p202 They soon decided to work exclusively with the blind cantor Mualim Mikhail Girgis El Batanouny, The History of Recording Coptic Hymns & the history of Moalem Mikhail by Ragheb Moftah Habashy (El-Keraza, 1975). and through nine winters until 1936 they compiled sixteen volumes of music which are now in the United States Library of Congress. In 1931 Newlandsmith gave a series of lectures at Oxford and Cambridge universities and in London. He claimed that when what he called the \\"appalling debris of Arabic ornamentation\\" was stripped away the music was not Turkish, Arab or Greek, but ancient Egyptian music handed down by oral tradition from the temples of pharaonic Egypt.The 1931 lecture script Literary works Published works include; * The Temple of Love.

After an ownership change it briefly became WGZS, which featured a Christian format.

In 1985, the station flipped the format to a rock oldies format using the Satellite Music Network Pure Gold music format and was call \\"The Lake\\". On February 25, 1987, the station changed its call sign to WLKD, when the owner moved the WLKE calls to an AM station he owned in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, (690 kHz). 1170 WLKD retained \\"The Lake\\" branding and oldies format, and was simulcast on 690 WLKE.

On October 27, 1981, the Soviet submarine U 137 became stranded deep inside Swedish waters. The Swedish Navy responded aggressively to these perceived threats, increasing patrols in Swedish waters, mining and electronically monitoring passages, and repeatedly chasing and attacking suspected submarines with depth charge bombs, but no hits or casualties were ever recorded. This incident encouraged development of incident weapons to increase security of future submarine incidents. Reports of new submarine sightings and television imagery of Swedish Navy helicopters firing depth charges into coastal waters against suspected intruders became commonplace in the mid-to-late 1980s. They remain, for many Swedes, one of the iconic images of the Cold War and of the Swedish relation to the Soviet Union‚Äîfor some underlining what was considered a major threat to Swedish sovereignty, while for others illustrating the tense atmosphere of the time. However, the reports of these incidents are not uncontested, and an intensive debate emerged early on. This debate unfolded somewhat, but far from exclusively, along leftwing/rightwing lines, and became tied up with the larger issues of relations to Moscow and Swedish armed neutrality. The Soviet Union consistently denied that it was responsible for violating Swedish waters, and claimed that the U 137 had only crossed the border because of navigational faults. Russia today maintains this stance. While the submarine sightings subsided with the fall of the Soviet Union, the debate about these events has reemerged sporadically. They have been the subject of a number of government investigations in Sweden, and continue to attract media attention. List of major reported incidentsDuring the cold war= ;1962: During a military exercise, a submarine is discovered by radar and hydrophone, north of F√•r√∂, Gotland. It retreats only after repeated depth charge strikes. ;October 1‚Äì24, 1966: At 0500 a submarine was reported being sighted in Gullmarsfjorden and warning shots were fired by nearby forces. Other sightings followed by warning shots were repeated during the following days. : On October 24 at mid day a submarine turret conning tower was spotted outside the naval depot √ñGull, deep inside Gullmarsfjorden. Two fishing type mine sweepers from the mine sweeping division at Lysekil immediately went out and managed to establish sonar contact with an object standing still at 10 meters below surface. After having established the exact position of the underwater object, the minesweeper Hassl√∂ was called in to fire warning shots at the location, while the other minesweepers kept contact with their sonar. Contact was lost briefly due to stirred up water and the sweeper's propeller wake. : After two hours since the first sighting one of the minesweepers managed to position itself on top of the located object. It then lowered a cable with a 100kg weight attached to confirm the existence of a solid underwater object. The wire slacked at a depth of 10m. As the sweeper moved forwards the weight was dragged on top of the object for a while and then fell down, stretching the wire as it did so. : Immediately after this, the other sweepers both noticed water turbulence, a possible sign of submarine propellers in motion. The sweeper Hassl√∂ then dropped a depth charge 300m away from the echo location and soon after got a radar contact from an object having breached the surface and went down again. Another depth charge was dropped, this time on the exact target location. The echo now disappeared and was not found again despite the search going on through the night followed by helicopters joining in the morning. At dawn (now the 25th) Hassl√∂ moved southwards and after a while its crew spotted a submarine periscope above the surface. The helicopter group was scrambled to the location, managed to establish contact with the submarine and attacked with depth charges. After that the contact with the submarine was lost. ;Autumn 1969: During a naval drill on the coast of Norrland, the Swedish submarine comes into contact with a foreign submarine in Swedish waters; it leaves the scene. ;1974: A submarine periscope is spotted by the Swedish Coast Guard near Kappelhamnsviken on Gotland. A destroyer is sent to the scene and establishes contact, at which point the foreign submarine leaves Swedish waters. ;Autumn 1976: During a naval drill in the Stockholm Archipelago, a Soviet Type W submarine exposes itself by using radar, outside Swedish territorial waters. A Swedish submarine monitors the Soviet vessel entering Swedish waters, and records sounds from it. When Swedish submarine-hunting helicopters and destroyers arrive, it speeds out towards international waters and disappears. ;September 18 ‚Äì October 6, 1980 (unlikely violation): The Swedish Marine tugboat Ajax discovers the conning tower of a submarine outside Ut√∂ in the Stockholm Archipelago. Submarine hunting helicopters are dispatched to the scene, establish contact, and fire warning shots. The submarine does not leave the area, but attempts to avoid capture, and a prolonged submarine hunt began. This lasted for several weeks, during which time the submarine is repeatedly sighted. ;October 27, 1981 (confirmed Soviet violation): The U 137 incident. On the evening of October 28, 1981, a fisherman residing in the eastern part of the Karlskrona archipelago phoned in to the Swedish Coast Guard and reported that a submarine had run aground in G√•sefj√§rden, 30 km from the town centre of Karlskrona. Originally, it was not taken seriously because of its location, as G√•sefj√§rden is a very difficult terrain to navigate in, as well as being a \\"dead end\\". Nevertheless, the fisherman was right, and the vessel was found to be of Soviet origin. The grounded submarine generated intense media interest, and Swedish military forces were put on high alert following suspicions that the Soviet Union would try to recapture the vessel. After several rounds of interrogation, the conservative/Liberal government led by Thorbj√∂rn F√§lldin decided to release both the vessel and its crew. This marked the beginning of the \\"submarine hunts\\" (ub√•tsjakter), as nicknamed by Swedish media. ; October 1‚Äì13, 1982 (established violation,Ompr√∂vning av ub√•tsfr√•gan, SOU 2001:85, page 220 later questioned): The H√•rsfj√§rden Incident. After a long period of submarine incidents, the Swedish Navy sets a trap by sealing off an area with mines and sensors. A foreign submarine is then recognized to have entered the trap, and the navy responds in force with major forces stationed nearby. A reported 44 depth charges and 4 naval mines are detonated, trying to sink the submarine, but it is later determined that it avoided the trap or fled at an early stage. This incident triggers the appointment of a parliamentary committee under the leadership of Sven Andersson, which‚Äîpartly due to the efforts of Carl Bildt‚Äîblames the Soviet Union, thereby escalating tension with Moscow. Later research has cast doubt on many of the conclusions of the committee, with some of the sound recordings from the purported submarine now believed to have come from a civilian ship. The entire incident is now hotly disputed, with some arguing the submarine may have been of NATO origin. ;May 4, 1983 (unlikely violation): A suspected submarine is reported in T√∂refj√§rden, North of Lule√•, and mines are detonated. ; May 1983: Submarine hunt outside Sundsvall. Helicopters establish contact with a foreign submarine, but are unable to fire, reportedly because civilian journalists have entered the safety area. ;Summer 1983 (unlikely violation): Submarine hunt in T√∂reviken. ;August 1983 (unlikely violation): Submarine hunt in the harbor area of Karlskrona and in the adjoining archipelago. Depth charges are fired inside Karlskrona harbor. ;February 9‚Äì29, 1984 (unlikely violation): Another submarine hunt in Karlskrona. 22 depth charges are fired against a suspected submarine. ;Early summer 1986 (established violation according to the submarine Commission but not the Swedish Defense Forces in 2001): A \\"mysterious object\\" is reported \\"diving into the water\\" in Klintehamnsviken on Gotland. The sea floor is examined, and double-track trace is discovered, allegedly from a submarine vehicle, extending 1100 meters. ;1 July 1987 (unlikely violation): Another submarine hunt in T√∂refj√§rden. ;Summer 1987 (established violation): While examining the magnetic sensors of a minefield in Kappelshamnsviken on Gotland, the military discovers \\"clear traces on the bottom from a tracked submarine vehicle\\". ;Early summer 1988 (established violation): A suspected foreign submarine is noticed in H√§vringebukten outside Oxel√∂sund. Submarine sounds and air venting is said to have been recorded. ;February 1, 1990 (confirmed West German submarine): A West German submarine which, after finding that it had entered the Swedish territory at Simrishamn, reported the mistake in navigation. West Germany has diplomatically deplored the violation. =After the cold war= ;Autumn 1992 (established submarine): In the H√§vring bay outside Oxel√∂sund, sonar observation leads to torpedo efforts by Sweden's new submarine force, which, however, risked lowering its own corvette. ;April 13, 2011 (incorrect observation ): A possible foreign submarine is noticed in Baggensfj√§rden in Nacka. The Swedish Armed Forces' Naval Tactical intelligence service, MTS-M2 investigated the incident. Later it was confirmed that the object was really a raft frozen in moving ice. ;September 11, 2011: An eyewitness contacts the Swedish armed forces after seeing something outside the harbor of Gothenburg that possibly could have been a foreign submarine. The Swedish Navy deployed several surface warships in an attempt to locate the unknown object.http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Aktuellt/centralanyheter/Marinen- undersoker-iakttagelser-i-Goteborgs-skargard/ ;October 17‚Äì24, 2014 (established but later questioned observation): A large military operation is launched to search for an allegedly damaged submarine in Kanholmsfj√§rden in the Stockholm archipelago. Encrypted transmissions sent on an emergency radio frequency used by Russian units were recorded. The sources of the transmissions were identified as a submarine and a military site in the Kaliningrad region. On October 19 the military said there had been three separate sightings and released a picture of the unidentified submarine to the public. There were also suggestions that the Russian oil tanker NS Concord was involved as a mother-ship for smaller underwater vehicles as it maintained a pattern of criss-crossing outside Stockholm during the investigation.Search for foreign vessel continues off Stockholm, The Local, October 20, 2014. A Russian research ship equipped with a submarine holding bay, R/V Professor Logachev,:sv:R/V Professor Logatjevhttp://www.marinetraffic.com/ais/details/ships/273456410/vessel:PROFESSOR_LOGACHEV was also in the area and turned off its location transponder. Several days later, the hunt was still on as officials were certain that foreign underwater operations were still ongoing. More than 100 sightings were now reported, said Supreme Commander G√∂ransson. Paul Schwartz at Center for Strategic and International Studies, CSIS, said the photograph could be a Russian Lada-class submarine. Sources later said it was certainly at least one mini-submarine and that advanced image analysis \\"reveales part of a submarine superstructure with two masts behind it\\". In April 2015, Rear Admiral Anders Grenstad has told Swedish newspapers that the Armed Forces reported to the Swedish government that at least one of the reports of a suspected underwater vessel was in fact only a civilian \\"working boat,\\" but that the initial suspected vessel is still believed to be foreign.  Controversy  Ola Tunander attributes the majority of these incursions to be of NATO origin: It should however be noted that Ola Tunander has largely been discredited as a conspiracy theorist after claims that Anders Behring Breivik was an Israeli agent. https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4162450,00.html as well as claims of a deep state existing in the United States, implying that terror attacks in the US were carried out as false flag operations. https://lightonconspiracies.com/how-the-deep-state-came-to-america-a-history/ Mattias G√∂ransson, the author of the book ‚ÄúThe Bear Comes‚Äù, which details previously suspected submarine violations that in hindsight proved to be something else, such as minke whales or shoals of fish, described the 2014 submarine chase as a ‚Äúpolitical meltdown‚Äù. He said the Swedish media had ‚Äúabout ten thousand chances‚Äù to learn to be more critical of claims of foreign powers‚Äô submarines in Swedish waters. He said: ‚ÄúOver the past 40 years, about the same number of underwater intrusions were reported by the population. Despite this, the Navy has failed to present a single bit of sustainable proof of a single conscious Russian submarine infringement.‚Äù https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1187535/russia-news-military-submarine- sweden-news Cultural influence The incursions during 1982 and 1983 form a basis for the plot of The Troubled Man (Den orolige mannen), the final Kurt Wallander novel written by Swedish author Henning Mankell and published in 2009. Mankell considered the incursions to be one of the worst scandals in Swedish political history. Mankell's play Politik, which debuted in autumn 2010, also dealt with the submarine incidents. In 1984 a Finn living in Sweden published the satirical Finnish novel Probable Submarine (Todenn√§k√∂inen sukellusvene) under the pen-name Klaus Viking. The work was later translated to Swedish as Sannolik u-b√•t by Paul Jansson. The novel is an examination of Swedish culture and politics as seen through the eyes of a Finnish immigrant who takes it upon himself to create some excitement by constructing a sham submarine and towing it through a restricted military area of the archipelago. It reflects a certain degree of amusement with which some segments of Sweden's neighbor populations regarded the country's recurrent searches for submarine violations of its territorial integrity.

He competed in North American regional promotions, including the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW), World Wrestling Council (WWC), World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) and Southwest Championship Wrestling (SWCW) during the 1970s and 1980s. Professional wrestling career Brooks got his start in 1969, joining his cousin Dick Murdoch in the Detroit and Toronto territories. He wore a hard hockey player's elbow guard and used it as a weapon. He fought Ben Justice, Tex McKenzie and Tiger Jeet Singh among others. Into the early 1970's, he also wrestled in the Cleveland based NWF taking on Haystacks Calhoun, Fred Curry and Tony Marino. He worked as a mid-level heel often being managed by Skandor Akbar, Armand Hussein and Gary Hart. Long before the infamous 1988 angle in the WWF between Hulk Hogan, Andr√© the Giant and Ted DiBiase over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Brooks had, in 1983, sold his NWA National Heavyweight Championship to Larry Zbyszko some time after winning it from Paul Orndorff. In this case, however, no interference from Zbyszko had happened during the match; and Zbyszko, despite being obviously stripped of a title he had not legitimately won, won it legitimately in the tournament that subsequently took place. Brooks left Georgia and went to Southwest Championship Wrestling (SCW) in San Antonio, Texas. During his stint in SWC Brooks won the SCW Southwest Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. He went to work in 1985 in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council and feuded with Hercules Ayala in a variety of matches that included a cage match, a dog collar match and a barbed wire match. He returned in 1987 and had a feud with Miguel P√©rez that started when he squashed a plate of rice and beans in P√©rez's face, following his match with Chicky Starr. He later teamed up with Eric Embry in a feud with the Youngblood brothers, Mark and Chris. In 1986, Brooks made appearances in the Montreal territory (Lutte Internationale) under the moniker of \\"Buster Brody\\", Bruiser Brody's kayfabe brother. He was presented in a straight jacket and under the control of the Creatchmans, Eddie Creatchman and son, Floyd Creatchman. In 1990, Brooks started the NAWA Pro Wrestling school. He ran shows weekly at the Stagecoach Ballroom in Ft. Worth, TX on Mondays and the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, TX on Tuesday nights. The Longhorn show led to TV tapings that aired on KXTX channel 39 in the DFW metroplex. The TV shows used many local talent including, Johnny Mantel, John Tatum, Scott Casey, and many of his students including Bullman Downs and Kenny the Stinger. Brooks retired in 1997, and was the owner and head trainer of the North American Wrestling Allegiance Pro Wrestling School, a training facility for his promotion N.A.W.A Pro Wrestling which runs televised shows in the Dallas-Ft. Worth, Texas area. Brooks trained many Texas area wrestlers, like John Allen, Doberman and Joey Corman. He was also credited as training Keith Lee. Personal life Brooks was married three times during his life, and had three sons from his first two marriages and a daughter from a relationship with professional wrestler Sandy Partlow. Brooks later reconciled with his daughter in the last ten years of his life. Brooks died on June 30, 2020, at the age of 72.

Some of the activities are considered to be prohibited by biblical law (the 39 Melachot), while others became prohibited later on, due to rabbinic decrees. These rabbinic Shabbat prohibitions are collectively known as shevut (◊©◊ë◊ï◊™).Mishneh Torah, Shabbat 21:1 The rabbinic prohibitions fall into several categories: activities not in the spirit of Shabbat; activities which closely resemble a forbidden activity; activities which could lead one to perform a prohibited activity; or activities whose biblical permissibility is debated, so avoiding the activity allows one to keep Shabbat according to all rabbinic opinions. As with most areas of Halacha, Orthodox Jews tend to observe these prohibitions more stringently than non-Orthodox Jews. Muktzeh Certain items may not be touched, moved or eaten on Shabbat because they are classified as muktzeh (off-limits). Reasons for items being considered muktzeh include their main use being a violation of Shabbat, the act of moving them risking a Shabbat violation, or if they were produced during Shabbat in violation of Shabbat. Money Although the use of money on Shabbat is not directly forbidden in the Torah, its use has long been condemned by the sages. Money is the very matter of business, and conducting or even discussing business on Shabbat is a rabbinically prohibited act. Additionally, many business transactions are customarily recorded on paper, and writing is one of the 39 melachot.To Be a Jew, A Guide to Jewish Observance in Contemporary Life, Rabbi Hayim Halevy Donin, √ì 1972, 1991 Basic Books, , pages 92-95 Amirah L'akkum It is rabbinically forbidden for a Jew to tell a non-Jew to do an activity forbidden on the Sabbath, regardless of whether the instruction was given on the Sabbath or beforehand.Amirah le‚ÄôAkum: Basic Parameters The reason is that otherwise, the sanctity of the Sabbath would be diminished, as any activity desired could be performed via proxy. It is also forbidden to benefit on Sabbath from such an activity, regardless of whether the non-Jew was instructed to do so or not. However, if the non-Jew does an activity for himself, a Jew may benefit from it. =Exceptions= Both \\"instruct\\" and \\"benefit\\" are defined here strictly. This gives rise to the following leniency: One may hint a non-Jew to turn off a light interfering with one's sleep, since eliminating a nuisance (the light) is not considered a benefit. Hinting may be done, for example, by saying: \\"The light is on, and I am forbidden to turn it off.\\" Another example of a non- benefit is turning on a light if there already is a minimal amount of light present. This is because an increased ease of function is not considered a benefit. When the activity desired is itself only rabbinically prohibited, it may be permitted to tell a non-Jew to perform the activity for important reasons, such as a communal benefit (such as a power outage in the synagogue) or a mitzvah (such as circumcision). This principle is known as shevut deshevut bimkom mitzvah. There are also leniencies in the event of a sick person, including even minor discomfort among very young children. Electricity The use of electricity on Shabbat is generally considered forbidden among Orthodox Jews. There is extensive debate regarding the source of this prohibition. According to most opinions, the prohibition is rabbinic. (Some uses of electricity may also involve a biblical prohibition, for example cooking on an electric stove.)

The pump house, whose first element was built in 1837, preserves a feature of the old canal, which relied on locks and pumps to move vessels over the low divide of the Delmarva Peninsula between Chesapeake Bay and Delaware Bay. Because there are no large rivers on the peninsula, water had to be pumped uphill to fill the upper canal and locks. When the canal was cut deeper in the twentieth century, such measures were no longer required, and the pump house is one of the last relics of the old canal. Description Exterior of pumphouse The landmark district is part of a row of buildings at the Back Creek Mooring Basin on the south side of the basin in Chesapeake City, Maryland. The buildings were built between 1837 and 1854 of fieldstone, brick and clapboard. The oldest and easternmost building is the Old Steam House (1837), which housed the original boiler and steam engine. The one-story fieldstone building has an asphalt shingle roof and is used for storage. The next oldest building, the westernmost, was built circa 1851 as the boiler house for the rest of the complex. Immediately to the east is the West Engine Building, also from 1851. The engine house contains one of the two Merrick single-cylinder steam engines. The interior of the structure is supported by cast iron columns. From the outside this appears to be a two-story structure, but is a single space inside. The East Engine Building, opposite the Wheel House, is similar in nature, but was built in 1853 or 1854. In the center, the Wheel House (1851) contains a lift wheel, wide, made of cypress, white oak and iron. The wheel could move per minute at 1.5 rpm. The building is now operated as the C&D; Canal Museum, also known as the Chesapeake & Delaware Lock Canal Museum, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Jarrolds) Cover design by Dame Laura Knight Strait is the Gate () is a 1909 French novel written by Andr√© Gide. It was translated into English by Dorothy Bussy. It probes the complexities and terrors of adolescence and growing up. Based on a Freudian interpretation, the story uses the influences of childhood experience and the misunderstandings that can arise between two people. Strait is the Gate taps the unassuaged memory of Gide's unsuccessful wooing of his cousin between 1888 and 1891. Much of the story is written as an epistolary novel between the Protagonist Jerome and his love Alissa. Much of the end of the novel is taken up by an exploration into Alissa's journal that details most of the events of the novel from her perspective. Plot The story is set in a French north coast town. Jerome and Alissa, cousins, as 10‚Äì11-year olds make an implicit commitment of undying affection for each other. However, in reaction to her mother's infidelities and from an intense religious impression, Alissa develops a rejection of human love. Nevertheless, she is happy to enjoy Jerome's intellectual discussions and keeps him hanging on to her affection. Jerome thereby fails to recognize the real love of Alissa's sister Juliette who ends up making a fairly unsatisfactory marriage with M. Tessiere as a sacrifice to her sister Alissa's love for Jerome. Jerome believes he has a commitment of marriage from Alissa, but she gradually withdraws into greater religious intensity, rejects Jerome and refuses to see him for longer and longer stretches of time. Eventually she dies in Paris from an unknown malady which is almost self-imposed. The ending of the novel occurs ten years after Alissa's death with the meeting of Jerome and Juliette. Juliette seems content to have a happy life with five children and a husband, but their conversation together in a room that resembles Alissa's concerns whether or not one can hold onto a love that is unrequited; as Jerome still loves Alissa, so it would seem that Juliette still loves Jerome, though both loves are equally as impossible.  Comparison with \\"The Immoralist\\"  Alissa reached, by going the other way round the world, a damnation very similar to the Immoralist's ‚Äì indeed, Strait is the Gate might be called The Moralist. Hers is a greater perversity than Michel's, who, after all, was only doing as liked. Alissa is doing what she does not like, and at each act of monstrous virtue her anguish increases, 'till at last it kills her. And yet, her vision of heavenly joy is so surpassingly beautiful as almost to justify its means. In the limited sense in which the Immoralist was right in sinning for earthly joy, Alissa was justified in sinning to achieve her view of heaven. And each pays the exact price ‚Äì spiritual death for Michel, bodily death and worse for Alissa. 'Whom can I persuade that this book is the twin of The Immoralist,' Gide wrote in his journal, 'that the two subjects grew up together in my mind, the excess of the one finding a secret permission in the excess of the other, so that the two together form an equipoise?\\" Title The title refers to a phrase in the Gospel of Luke in the Bible: This verse appears at the end of the first chapter as the subject of a sermon on the Sunday after Alissa's mother runs away with another man. During this sermon Jerome resolves to become virtuous enough to deserve Alissa. However Alissa ultimately interprets the \\"strait and narrow\\" to preclude any earthly happiness that Jerome and she could share in marriage. The problem here being that the gate of virtue is too narrow for two people, too narrow for love, and too narrow for two people in love. Alissa so deliriously desires that even though she loves Jerome, this love between them has become, in her mind, his impediment to virtue. She rejects him, time and time again, and yet this is the way in which she expresses love, because this is the only way he would enter the strait gate. What Alissa longs for, is not the strait gate itself, but the process of getting through the gate - it is the striving in ‚Äústrive to enter in at the strait gate‚Äù. If either the strait gate of virtue or Jerome‚Äôs love were no more, Alissa‚Äôs desire would still stand. This is because it is not that we desire ‚Äúsomething,‚Äù but that our desires and what we desire are ultimately a situation, a process, in which overall, something becomes the object of desire.

As the Deputy Speaker of the Fourth Parliament his tenure was cut short by his resignation on June 20, 1983 . The resignation of Mr. arap Keino arose out of a contentious ruling he had made a few days earlier barring the then Member for Lurambi South the Hon.

His resignation forestalled the debate on a no Confidence Motion in him to have been moved by the Member for Bungoma South, the Hon. L. S. Sifuna.

It is unusual in that sometimes, especially when the leaves are crushed, it has an extremely unpleasant smell. Description Myoporum viscosum is a shrub which sometimes grows to in height with young branches that are flattened and sticky. The leaves are arranged alternately and mostly long, wide, thick and stiff. The base of the leaf partly wraps around the stem and the leaf blade is folded or curved with serrated edges and has many oil dots. The flowers appear in the leaf axils in clusters of 5 to 8 on a stalk long. There are 5 triangular sepals and 5 petals joined at their bases to form a bell-shaped tube. The petals are white with a slight purplish flush and purple spots. The petal tube is long, the lobes are about the same length and the inside of the tube as well as the bases of the lobes are hairy. The main flowering period is from June to November and is followed by fruits which are succulent, rounded purplish drupes around in diameter. Taxonomy and naming Myoporum viscosum was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae in 1810 from a specimen collected at Memory Cove. The specific epithet is derived from the Latin word viscum meaning \\"bird-lime\\" with the ending -osus \\"abounding in\\", that is, \\"sticky\\" or \\"viscid\\". Distribution and habitat For many years this species has been confused with the much more common species Myoporum petiolatum which has thinner, noticeably petiolate and non-odorous leaves. Myoporum viscosum has a restricted distribution encompassing Kangaroo Island and coastal areas of the Eyre and Yorke peninsulas. Use in horticulture Sticky boobialla is a hardy plant which can tolerate salt spray and can be used as a low screening plant. It is readily propagated from cuttings and grows best in full sun.

Background Coventry was bred by Edward Simms, the owner of Xalapa Farm in Paris, Kentucky, who had purchased a half interest in his sire Negofol from Louis Jean Decazes. Consigned to the 1923 yearling auction, Coventry was sold for $25,000 to New York carpet manufacturer Gifford A. Cochran. In 1925, Coventry's training was handled by future U.S. Hall of Fame member Bill Duke, who knew the colt's breeding, having returned from France that year where he had been training Thoroughbreds since 1888. Duke had trained Coventry's sire, Negofol, for Willie Vanderbilt's racing stable and had won important races with him, including the French Derby. Back home in the United States, in 1925 Duke also trained Coventry's stable mate, a colt owned by Gifford Cochran named Flying Ebony whose ability to run extremely well on muddy racetracks resulted in his winning of the May 16 rain-soaked Kentucky Derby. Racing career Coventry made just five lifetime starts, winning once. The one win came in the 1925 Preakness Stakes. Ridden by Clarence Kummer, the colt went off at the longest odds of any Preakness winner in history, paying backers $45.60 for a $2 wager. That record stood for exactly fifty years until Master Derby in 1975 paid $48.80. In his next race, the Withers Stakes at New York's Aqueduct Racetrack, Coventry broke down and was retired to stud. Stud record He had very limited success as a sire. Hand To Hand and Durango were his best runners, each winning a number of minor races.

She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 8 November 1994 and departed on 23 June 1995. Casting Quilter joined the cast in 1994. Actress Kimberley Joseph also auditioned for the part of Donna, but it was Quilter who secured the role. Quilter starred in the series for nine months, but she felt that the role had distracted her from a music career. While working on Home and Away Quilter was stalked by a viewer who became \\"sexually obsessed\\" with her. He found out her filming schedule and repeatedly phoned her when she finished filming. He tricked her into believing it was someone close to her, but when she changed her telephone number the harassment stopped. Character development In December 1994, Quilter fractured a bone in her foot when a wall-mounted bed fell onto it. She was given crutches to aid her mobility while it healed. Rachel Browne from The Sun-Herald reported that Quilter's accident had \\"thrown production schedules into disarray\\" because the scripts required Donna to be using her feet. Donna became central to a storyline highlighting domestic abuse. When Donna was introduced into the series she was given a backstory of her being the victim of violence inflicted by boyfriend Andrew Warren (Adrian Lee). Andrew was introduced into the series and Donna decides to give their relationship another go. Lee told Victoria Ross from Inside Soap that Donna is \\"in big trouble\\" being with Andrew again. He explained that men like Andrew have something that \\"makes them flip\\" and for his character, jealousy brings on his violence. \\"When he sees Donna with another man he just lashes out\\". After Andrew witnesses Donna with Rob Storey (Matthew Lilley) and Travis Nash (Nic Testoni) he hits her and Donna is left with a black eye. Lee said that he had researched the issue by looking at associated text and women who had been the victims of domestic violence. He was also \\"impressed\\" with Home and Away for choosing to portray the Donna and Andrew's story. The actor felt \\"edgy\\" about playing issue led storylines, but he was more inclined to portray this storyline as he felt it was important that the story behind the abuse was told. Storylines Donna returns to Summer Bay, having previously grown up in the area and attended school. She reconnects with former lover Rob and takes a job alongside him at their former high school. Donna is friendly toward Rob but backs off when she learns his girlfriend Roxanne Miller (Lisa Lackey) is suffering from breast cancer. Donna moves in with Michael (Dennis Coard) and Pippa Ross (Debra Lawrence) and their foster children at Summer Bay House. One day while she is taking a shower, Jack Wilson (Daniel Amalm) walks in on Donna much to her embarrassment. She is further embarrassed when Jack brags to his friends at school. As way of an apology, Jack shows Donna how to lock the door but Michael catches them in the bathroom together and demands an explanation. Donna comforts Rob when Roxy leaves town and it looks like they may reconcile but Andrew's arrival unnerves her. It emerges that Andrew is Donna's ex-boyfriend and used to beat her. When Donna slaps Andrew during an argument, she is left feeling ashamed, thinking she is no better than him. She apologises and softens towards him. When Donna and Andrew reconcile, Rob is horrified. They seem happy until Andrew's jealousy overwhelms him when Donna begins spending time with Rob and their old friend Travis. This culminates in Andrew hitting her. Donna leaves him and later returns to collect her things but is unexpectedly attacked by Andrew. Rob arrives on the scene and rescues Donna. Andrew is arrested and leaves the Bay after resigning from his teaching position. Donna then moves in with Travis and they become a couple. Her brother Gus (Samuel Johnson) arrives to stay with her and causes trouble for numerous bay residents. When Gus' relationship with Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie) fails, he plans to run away and taunts Donna that her inability to control him will make their parents no longer see Donna as the perfect daughter. Their father, Charles (David Baldwyn) arrives and tells Gus off about disappearing. Donna reaches her limit with Gus and threatens to report him to the police for his various acts of vandalism. Gus is then sent home. Donna then resigns from the school and decides to go on a whale-watching tour with Travis. They leave for Canada but Travis returns alone several months later, revealing that they have broken up and Donna is now with someone else. Reception The episode featuring the climax of Donna's domestic abuse at the hands of Andrew was nominated for \\"Best Episode in a Television Drama Serial\\" at the Australian Film Institute Awards in 1995.

It was likely located in the territory of the modern town of Labico. History  Its foundation is expressly ascribed by Virgil to the kings of Alba Longa, and its name is found also in the list given by Diodorus Siculus of the colonies of that city.Virgil, Aeneid vi. 776Diodorus Siculus, vii. ap. Euseb. Arm. p. 185 Hence, there is no doubt that it was properly a Latin city, though its name does not appear among the list of those that composed the Latin League.Dionysius of Halicarnassus, v. 61 But it fell at an early period into the hands of the Aequians. Dionysius of Halicarnassus describes it as one of the towns taken by Coriolanus, together with Toleria and Labicum;Dionysius of Halicarnassus, viii. 18Plutarch, Coriolanus 28 and though Livy does not notice its conquest upon that occasion, he speaks of it as an Aequian town, when the name next occurs in history towards the end of the 5th century BC. In this instance the Bolani were among the foremost to engage in war, and ravaged the lands of the neighboring Labicum, but being unsupported by the rest of the Aequians, they were defeated, and their town taken.Livy, iv. 49Diodorus Siculus, xiii. 42 It was, however, recovered by the Aequians, and a fresh colony established there, but was again taken by the Romans under Publius Postumius Albus Regillensis, and it was on this occasion that the proposal to establish a Roman colony there, and portion out its lands among the settlers, gave rise to one of the fiercest mutinies in Roman history.Livy, iv. 49-51 Whether the colony was actually sent, the town was again in the hands of the Aequians in 389 BC, when they were defeated beneath its walls by Marcus Furius Camillus; but Diodorus Siculus represents it as then occupied by the Latins, and besieged by the Aequians.Livy, vi. 2Diodorus Siculus, xiv. 117 This is the last mention of the name in history:In Diodorus Siculus xx. 90, \\"Bola\\" is certainly a mistake or corruption of the text for Bovianum. it was probably destroyed during these wars, as we find no subsequent trace of its existence; and it is enumerated by Pliny among the towns which had in his time utterly disappeared.Pliny the Elder, iii. 5. s. 9 The site is called Poli, situated in the mountains about eight miles north of Praeneste; but Livy tells us that its ager bordered on that of Labicum, and the narratives of Dionysius and Plutarch above cited seem clearly to point to a situation in the neighborhood of Labicum and Pedum. Hence it is much more probable, as suggested by Francesco Ficoroni and Antonio Nibby, that it occupied the site of Lugano, a village about 5 miles south of Palestrina (Praeneste), and 9 miles southeast of La Colonna (Labicum). The position is, like that of most of the other towns in this neighborhood, naturally fortified by the ravines that surround it: and its situation between the Aequian mountains on the one side, and the heights of Algidus Mons on the other, would necessarily render it a military point of importance both to Aequians and Latins.Francesco Ficoroni, Memorie di Labico, pp. 62-72Antonio Nibby, Dintorni di Roma, vol. i. pp. 291-294 References Category:Latin cities Category:Destroyed cities Category:Former populated places in Italy ","title":"Bolae"},{"id":"17931142","text":"Ocobamba District may refer to: * Ocobamba District, Chincheros * Ocobamba District, La Convenci√≥n ","title":"Ocobamba District"},{"id":"17931166","text":"Holtville High School in Elmore County, Alabama serves grades 9-12 and is part of the Elmore County School System.

He is often confused with contemporary and fellow Dominican Tancred of Bologna, since the two of them are impossible to always distinguish in the sources. Tancred has been accredited many conversions and even miracles and by some accounts is beatified. Tancred was born in Siena to wealthy parents of the Tancredi clan. They oversaw his extensive education, sending him first to the University of Bologna and thence to Paris, where he received his doctorate. He returned from Paris to Siena, where he first heard the preaching of Dominic in the Sienese cathedral. According to later reports, he had a vision of the Virgin Mary standing beside Dominic and after the sermon she approached Tancred and beseeched him to \\"follow that man; and do not depart from him.\\" In the Hospital of Saint Mary Magdalene Tancred received the habit from Dominic and embarked upon a life of religion. In an early incident related by Tancred to Jordan of Saxony, Dominic was visiting the prior's church when a young relative of Stephen Orsini, Cardinal Abbot of Fossanova, was carried past in a litter after falling from a horse. According to Jordan, it was unknown if he was alive or dead, but at the insistence of Tancred, Dominic prayed to God for the boys life and he was miraculously healed. This story was amplified by later retellings. The boy is Napoleon, Stephen's nephew, and Stephen faints upon hearing the news, falling into Dominic's arms. At Tancred's urging, it is Stephen who prays to God and receives a miracle: the boy, dead is brought back to life. Tancred was probably the prior of San Sisto Vecchio in Rome until it was converted into a Dominican nunnery. He was transferred to Santa Sabina to continue serving as prior. In 1222, after the death of Dominic the previous year, Tancred left Italy for the Holy Land as the superior of a group of friars, appointed by Jordan of Saxony to establish a mission there. Tancred founded several houses in the Latin East and it is claimed that he won many converts, to Christianity and to mendicancy. Though Tancred did not remain at the head of the Dominicans in the Holy Land, he did remain there until his death in 1241. The Dominican historian and hagiographer Gregory Lombardelli, wrote the first biography of Tancred, Vita de Tancredo Tancredi. He ascribes to him several works of as yet unpublished literature: commentaries on the Scriptures and on Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences. These were probably written during the period after his return to Siena and before his entrance into the order. References *O'Daniel, Victor F.

The district preserves the center of one of the few examples of the Garden city movement in the United States. With its sister cities of Greenhills, Ohio and Greendale, Wisconsin, Greenbelt was intended to be a \\"new town\\" that would start with a clean slate to do away with problems of urbanism in favor of a suburban ideal. Along with the never-commenced town of Greenbrook, New Jersey, the new towns were part of the New Deal public works programs. Greenbelt's center has survived with few alterations compared with its sister towns. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997. and History In April 1935 Congress passed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, intended to counter the effects of the Great Depression through the appropriation of $5 billion for jobs programs. As a result, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Resettlement Administration (RA) to coordinate federal efforts concerning housing and land, placing particular emphasis on rural poverty. While the focus of the RA remained primarily rural, it was also charged with resettling farm workers who were leaving agriculture in search of industrial work. New towns were seen as a solution to this problem, to be built outside urban areas and surrounded by healthful green belts of preserved land. As many as 3000 of these towns were initially envisioned. 100 cities were studied for new towns, eventually narrowing to 25. Four sites were picked for the first trials: Washington, D.C., Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Cincinnati, Ohio and New Brunswick, New Jersey. The Washington site was to be near Berwyn, Maryland, on land depleted by tobacco farming. were purchased, and work began in late 1935, using 1000 laborers. Architects and planners were hired in June 1935, site construction began in December 1935, and Roosevelt was briefed on the plans in April 1936. Wallace Richards was the RA regional coordinator, Douglas Ellington was the principal architect, Reginald Wadsworth was associate principal architect, Hale Walker was the town planner, and Harold Bursley was the engineering designer. The design team described areas for group housing, single-family residences, light and heavy industry, businesses, schools and parks. beyond the original town area, planned for 4000 families, two more areas were reserved for 3000 families each, with capacity for 50% growth. Much of the land south of Greenbelt Road that was designated for town expansion has since been transferred to the National Park Service and is now Greenbelt Park, while other areas became the Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center. Within the planned suburban development, 1000 units were designated for white residents, and 250 for African-American residents. A tract was designated the Rossville Rural Development, and was apparently meant to be an area of 50 farms for African-Americans, based on the old African-American community of Rossville. Both Rossville and the suburban housing for African- Americans were eventually dropped from the plan. Greenbelt Community Center Construction involved the transport of as many a 5000 men by rail to the Branchville railroad halt each day. Roosevelt visited on November 13, 1936. However, politics intervened, and amid criticism of the program, the RA was placed under the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In September 1937 it became the Farm Security Administration. By 1938 the greenbelt town was dissolved. The construction cost for Greenbelt was estimated at $13,394,400. The government began accepting applications for residence in Greenbelt, basing acceptance on income, health, family size, financial reliability, clean living habits and indications of community spirit.Likowski, Barbara and McCarl, Jay, \\"Greenbelt: Social Construction‚Äù, Greenbelt: History of a New Town ‚Äì 1937‚Äì1987, Mary Lou Williamson, Norfolk, Virginia: The Donning Company, 1987, p. 71-80 Prospective tenants were interviewed at their homes. Wives were not permitted to work, and were expected to stay home and take care of children. The average age of the initial tenants was 29 years. Tenants paid $18‚Äì25 per month for an apartment, and $28‚Äì41 for a semidetached house. The town was managed as a cooperative, with a citizens committee to run the commercial center. This arrangement was viewed with considerable skepticism, particularly within Congress. Eventually, by the 1950s, several members of Greenbelt's coops appeared before Congressional subcommittees on charges of communism and monopolistic practices as part of the McCarthy investigations. After several abortive attempts to divest itself of the town, the Federal Government hired Hale Walker, the town's original planner, along with Harold Heller to develop a master plan for expansion of the town. The new plan envisioned a reduction of agricultural use and an increase in single-family housing. In 1947 the Greenbelt Mutual Home Owners Corporation was formed as a vehicle for the sale of the town. Congressional legislation was passed that allowed the government to sell the greenbelt towns to non-profit groups with at least 50% veteran members. In December 1952 the Greenbelt Veterans Housing Corporation (GVHC) bought 1580 units and of developed land for $6,285,450. In 1953 the GVHC bought of undeveloped land for $670,219. Other areas were sold to private developers, and in 1956 the GVHC sold the undeveloped land to cover its loan. In 1957 Greenbelt Homes, Inc. was formed from the GVHC to manage the community, and retains title to 1600 units and of land. The supermarket remains a co-op. =Highway construction= The community opposed the proposed Baltimore‚ÄìWashington Parkway, beginning in 1946, but the road was completed in 1954 through part of the greenbelt reservation. In the 1960s the Capital Beltway was built through the middle of the Greenbelt reservation, destroying the \\"Indian Springs\\" that had been a recreational feature, as well as an Indian cemetery. Description Greenbelt is laid out as a crescent of \\"superblocks\\" containing two rows of frame or concrete block multi-family dwellings. Houses are linked by footpaths and are grouped around central service courts, with the public sides facing the communal \\"garden\\" space. A central town common includes the original commercial district, community center and school, linked to the residential areas by pedestrian underpasses. A recreation area, lake, and allotment gardens are located beyond the common. The architecture is modernist in style. The historic district includes more than 400 structures, as well as three pre-existing family cemeteries. The original center of Greenbelt has since been surrounded by newer development, causing it to be compared with a medieval fortress town, a walled center surrounded by contemporary neighborhoods. Pedestrian path and underpass Greenbelt borrowed techniques pioneered seven years previously at Radburn, New Jersey, which turned housing layouts \\"inside-out\\" to keep automobiles and service traffic hidden. The architectural design, while modern in tone, borrows details such as pitched slate roofs, plain walls and steel casement windows from the English garden cities at Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City. International Style influences are visible in the white walls and flat roofs of the concrete block buildings. Landscaping was integrated into the design, with mature specimen trees saved or transplanted during site development. Each of the group housing units had a plot by between the house and the parklands, cared for by the tenant. On the service side space was provided for trash storage and clothes drying. Landscaping was used to create privacy, and the finished community was notable for the maturity of the plantings. Apartments in Greenbelt =Housing= A strategy for group housing was followed, the result of questionnaires distributed to potential inhabitants, as well as considerations of the economy of attached units. Units are typically two stories tall, with one-story units at the ends of rows, initially called \\"honeymoon units.\\" All units are slab-on-grade, with basements omitted as a result of the high local water table. Central utilities are provided. The concrete block units were built by unskilled labor, with the concrete first floor structure employed as the ceiling finish for the ground floor. Pitched- roof units were built using balloon frame construction. Interiors were highly organized, with few closets and a minimally sized, but well-equipped kitchen. Children's closets had built-in ladders for access to higher shelving. Furniture was offered based on Scandinavian designs. Twelve multi-family units were built, using three standard floor plans in buildings of 18 to 48 units. These buildings were built with basements, offering storage, laundry and children's play space. Unlike the group housing areas, the primary facades face the street, and feature extensive areas of glass block. The International Style features prominently, with flat roofs and concrete structure. =Experimental and private development= Five residential units were built on Woodland Way as demonstration projects for economical construction. The one story, two-bedroom units featured the use of plywood as a structural material and as a cladding, using a module. The only privately constructed houses in Greenbelt are ten units on Forestway Road, known as Parkbelt Homes. The Parkbelt Homes were built by General Houses of Chicago. These were supposed to be followed by another 190 units under a cooperative ownership plan. The houses were designed to be mass-produced using steel frame construction and insulated panels, predating the similar Lustron product by a decade. Lawsuits arising from rental disagreements and issues of maintenance apparently prevented further construction. 1000 units were built in 1941‚Äì42 as \\"defense housing\\" by the Federal Works Agency, following the general principles of earlier housing. However, many features were cut back or compromised for economy. =Communal buildings= The central common area was planned for 1000 families, to be expanded later to 3000. The initial facilities comprised a school/community center, a fire/police station and automobile repair shop, two commercial buildings and a gasoline station. An administration building and a hotel were planned, but remained unbuilt. The school is a noteworthy example of Art Deco design. The commercial buildings use Streamline Moderne motifs, including rounded corners, ribbon windows and flat roofs. The commercial area focuses on the 1938 \\"Mother and Child\\" sculpture by Lenore Thomas Straus. The \\"Rural High School\\", later Greenbelt Middle School, was built between 1936 and 1945. Like the elementary school, it is a notable Art Deco building, using glass block extensively. Legacy Greenbelt is the best-preserved of the three built greenbelt towns, retaining much of its green space reserve despite the encroachment of development and highway construction. The Greenbelt model provided inspiration to other projects in the United States. Parade Park in Kansas City, Missouri, River Park in southwest Washington, D.C., and Parktown in Cincinnati, Ohio, were built by the Reynolds Aluminum Company Service Corporation as showcases for aluminum construction, and were based on the Greenbelt urban model. The town of Kitimat, British Columbia, was built in 1953 by the Aluminum Company of Canada along similar lines. Both Vallingby in Sweden and Chandigarh in East Punjab, India, were influenced by Greenbelt, as was the British New town Program after 1946. Less influence was felt by the planners of Columbia, Maryland, and Reston, Virginia, in the 1960s.

He is CEO and executive editor of Metro Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley's alternative newsweekly, as well as its sister publications, Good Times, the North Bay Bohemian (Santa Rosa) and the Pacific Sun (Marin County). He also is also the founder of Boulevards New Media, a network of city guides. Early life Born in suburban New Jersey, where his parents were school teachers, Pulcrano entered the publishing field while still in junior high, when he produced an underground newspaper at the Wardlaw Country Day School in Plainfield. He was asked to leave the school as a result and attended public schools afterwards, graduating at 16 and joining the staff of the San Diego Reader. At age 19, he went to Los Angeles to help publisher Jay Levin launch the LA Weekly. CareerWeekly newspapers= After graduating from University of California at Santa Cruz, Pulcrano founded the Los Gatos Weekly in the Silicon Valley community of Los Gatos. Pulcrano served as publisher, editor and owner. In 1990, it merged with the Times-Observer into the Los Gatos Weekly-Times. Three years after founding the Los Gatos Weekly, Pulcrano expanded his efforts into the greater Silicon Valley region with the launch of Metro Silicon Valley. Inspired by Levin's LA Weekly and the alt-weeklies that were then appearing in major American cities, Metro offers political reporting as well as calendar listings, music reviews and critical coverage of the performing and visual arts, as well as movie reviews. Based in downtown San Jose, which had been in a state of decline for two decades, Metro championed arts, independent cinema, small theater and retail revitalization in the city's core. Metros investigative journalism was responsible in 2013 for the prosecution and conviction of Santa Clara County Supervisor George Shirakawa Jr. on multiple felony corruption charges. The newspaper also sparked state Fair Political Practices Commission and Grand Jury investigations of San Jose City Councilman Xavier Campos' campaign activity and has reported over the past decade on the financial relationship between the nonprofit Working Partnerships USA and the South Bay Labor Council. The investigative reports were followed by attacks posted to an anonymous attack web site and on the day that Metro published an expos√© on the use of monies raised for low income children's health care premiums to fund political campaigns, at a press conference which highlighted hyperlinks from Metro's web site to adult ads on the web site of online classified advertising provider Backpage.com. Over the next decade, Pulcrano oversaw the purchase and startups of five more community weekly newspapers in Santa Clara County, including the Saratoga News, Cupertino Courier, Sunnyvale Sun, Willow Glen Resident and Campbell Reporter. In 1999, these newspapers and the Los Gatos Weekly-Times, were spun off as the Silicon Valley Community Newspapers group and sold in December 2002 to a Metro executive who sold them to Knight-Ridder in 2005, the year before the sale of its Bay Area newspapers to Dean Singleton's MediaNews Corp., now known as Digital First and controlled by Alden Global Capital. In 1994, Pulcrano returned to his college town of Santa Cruz to launch Metro Santa Cruz and purchased the Sonoma County Independent. In 2000, he rebranded the publication North Bay Bohemian to support the Santa Rosa paper's expanded coverage of Napa and Marin counties. Metro Santa Cruz was renamed Santa Cruz Weekly in 2009. Santa Cruz Weekly ended its run in April 2014 when Metro purchased its weekly competitor Good Times;;, along with three community weeklies south of Silicon Valley: the Gilroy Dispatch, Morgan Hill Times and Hollister Free Lance. In May 2015, Pulcrano negotiated the purchase of the oldest alternative weekly in the Western U.S., the Pacific Sun, and told the Silicon Valley Business Journal that the group's circulation had grown from 110,000 to 190,000 over a 14-month period. =Online entrepreneurship= As the newspaper group flourished, Pulcrano launched one of Silicon Valley's first online community portals. In 1993, as a board member of the Association of Alternative Newsweeklies, he wrote a paper \\"The Alternative Press at the Crossroads: Will We Be Players in the New Information Age Or Road Kill on the Digital Highway?\\" That same year, he launched Livewire, an early online player offering email, newsgroups, networking and live chatrooms. The following year, he launched Boulevards New Media, with the stated intention of \\"inventing the local media of the future\\". The company is built around a Pulcrano's portfolio of \\"cityname.com\\" Web domains, including Seattle.com, SanFrancisco.com, LosAngeles.com, Philadelphia.com and more than 100 others ‚Äì including 20 of the nation's top 30 markets. Boulevards has never been sold, acquired, venture-funded or taken public. Pulcrano served as Chairman of the Board of Associated Cities, LLC for two years in 2006 and 2007. He continues to write and oversee operations in both his newspaper and online ventures. Other ventures Pulcrano used SXSW as an inspiration for a technology and arts festival in Silicon Valley, C2SV. Pulcrano also chairs the San Jose Downtown Association's marketing, dining and arts committee, where he has sought to revitalize downtown San Jose.

Publication history The first series was published by Topps Comics and ran for 41 issues from January 1995 to September 1998, coinciding with the second through fifth seasons of the television program. In 1996, Topps published X-Files #0, an adaptation of the pilot episode, in order to test the market for a series adapting the episodes of the X-Files TV series. The issue was successful, and X-Files Season One ran for nine issues (August 1997 ‚Äì July 1998). The series's name was provisional, and Topps in fact intended to adapt every episode, but never got as far as season two. The series was written by Roy Thomas, who would create a first draft for each issue by working off of the episode's script, then watch the actual episode and modify his work to account for changes made on the set. Topps also published Ground Zero, a four-issue mini-series (December 1997 ‚Äì March 1998). Tony Isabella reported difficulties with The X-Files creator Chris Carter over the Topps Comics' series: The digest consisted of three issues published at five month intervals beginning December 1995 through September 1996, each featuring separate titles: \\"Big Foot, Warm Heart\\", \\"Dead to the World\\", and \\"Scape Goats\\". All included stories from Ray Bradbury Comics. There were also a number of one-offs like the Hero Illustrated Special (March 1995), and the graphic novel Afterflight (August 1997). Wildstorm published The X-Files Special in August 2008. It was a one-shot timed with the release of the second film, written by Frank Spotnitz with art by Brian Denham.'X-Files': Sneak Peek at New Comic Book!, Entertainment Weekly The deal Spotnitz signed was for another two comics.Spotnitz Wants to Believe in Wildstorm's \\"The X-Files Special\\", Comic Book Resources, June 12, 2008 This became a six-part series that ran from November 2008 to April 2009 with Spotnitz writing the first two issues, Marv Wolfman for #3‚Äì4, and Doug Moench for #5‚Äì6. Wildstorm then teamed with IDW to publish The X-Files/30 Days of Night to positive reviews from July 2010. The six-issue limited series is written by 30 Days of Night creator Steve Niles and Tool guitarist Adam Jones and follows Mulder and Scully to Alaska to investigate a series of grisly murders that may be linked to vampires. IDW then went on in July 2013 to begin publishing The X-Files Season 10 as an ongoing series reuniting Mulder and Scully with creator Chris Carter returning as executive producer. This was followed by the eight-issue The X-Files Season 11 in 2015. By the end of 2016, IDW Publishing has re-released all the previous Topps comics in collected form.

Afterflight dealt with elements of the mystery airship flap. Fight the Future was the official film adaptation, \\"Fight the Future\\" being the film's subtitle used to differentiate it from the television series. Season One adapted some of the episodes from the first season: \\"Pilot\\", \\"Deep Throat\\", \\"Squeeze\\", \\"Conduit\\", \\"Ice\\", \\"Space\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Beyond the Sea\\" and \\"Shadows\\". Two others, \\"The Jersey Devil\\" and \\"Ghost in the Machine\\", were solicited but never published. Despite coinciding with the film, The X-Files Special will not be an adaptation but is set in what the writer calls \\"the classic period of the X-Files\\" ‚Äì between Season 2 and Season 5. While this is a stand-alone story, he will be writing two more which fit into the broader conspiracy theory that developed, saying \\"the next ones that I am going to write tie into the mythology of the show not in a way that changes the path but deepens it a little bit.\\" Collected editions The series has been collected into trade paperbacks.

Before his founding of the Bank of Dexter Horton in 1870 financial transactions were conducted by merchants. Dexter Horton was born in 1825 in Seneca Lake, New York. He was raised on a farm his family acquired in the state of Illinois. As a young man he traveled to Oregon with others who were living in his area. Having lived in Oregon for a time he relocated to Seattle. After working as a mill hand for Henry Yesler he opened a general store. This business succeeded. A part of the business was making loans and accepting deposits from customers. In 1870 Dexter Horton opened up the first business dedicated to serving as a bank. It was one of the corporate ancestors of Seattle First National Bank, which eventually merged into the Bank of America. According to Seattle lore, decades after the battle 1856 Battle of Seattle, Seattle's future fire chief Gardner Kellogg was excavating his house and found a shell from the USS Decatur that had buried itself without exploding. He stuck it under a tree stump that he was trying to burn out and went off to lunch; Dexter Horton stopped by to warm the seat of his pants at the fire, and as it exploded, nearly became the last casualty of the battle of Seattle. Horton was married to Hannah Eliza Shoudy, sister of John Alden Shoudy, in 1844, and they had three children but two died early. After her death, he married Caroline E.

He was admitted as a solicitor in 1892 and entered into partnership with his father as H. Hurry & Son in the same year. He practised as a solicitor until his election to parliament, but also acquired ownership of Kenny's Family Hotel in 1913.

The Superintendent of Schools is Meg Mayo-Brown. The Assistant Superintendent is Kristen Harmon. History Although it is unknown when the school district started, it is generally believed to have been in existence by the early 1900s. =2001 and 2003 Overrides Fail= In 2001, a Proposition 2¬Ω override failed to pass. In addition to teacher cuts across the system and reductions in each school's budget, the most significant losses were to the schools' award-winning music program; elementary school feeder programs were cut completely. In 2002 the district faced another budget shortfall and the school committee voted to implement fees for bus transportation, music programs and sports programs. A 2003 override was attempted to remove these fees and prevent further staff lay-offs. The override failed and the fees remained. The loss of feeder music programs in 2001 and the subsequent fees for participation in the high school music program decimated the award-winning Barnstable High School Marching Band. =Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee= In 2001, the school committee was sued under the court case Fitzgerald v. Barnstable School Committee. The case went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that parents could sue school committees for sexual harassment under the Fourteenth Amendment. The $3,000,000 suit was eventually settled for $150,000. =2008 Budget Crisis= With the Late-2000s recession, the state was forced to cut $6,000,000 in local aid. Faced with serious budgetary constraints, the School Committee opted to go with their third option, which entailed closing three elementary schools, moving the fourth and fifth grades into Barnstable United Elementary School (formerly Barnstable Horace Mann Charter Public School), moving the sixth and seventh grades into Barnstable Intermediate School (formerly Barnstable Middle School), and moving the eighth grade into Barnstable High School. The School Committee chose to close Cotuit Elementary School, Marstons Mills Elementary School, and Osterville Bay Elementary School in 2008. To date, only Cotuit Elementary School has been re-purposed by the Waldorf School of Cape Cod. The other two buildings remain vacant and have fallen into disrepair. SchoolsActiveBarnstable Intermediate School= Barnstable Intermediate School is a combination elementary/middle school (Grades 6-7). It is located on Route 28 in the village of Hyannis. Originally named Barnstable Middle School from 1976‚Äì1992, the school changed its name to Barnstable Middle School at Hyannis because of the building of a middle school in Marstons Mills. The school reverted to its original name in 2003 after the school system was reorganized. In 2009, with another reorganization, the school was named the Barnstable Intermediate School to reflect the addition of the 6th grade and the loss of the 8th graders. When the school was called BMS, the seventh grade was primarily educated in English, Social Studies, Science, and Math (Course 2 or Pre-Algebra). The eighth grade was primarily educated in English, Social Studies, Science and Math (Pre-Algebra or Algebra 1). Some of the enrichment classes offered were Physical Education, Health, Art, Band, Orchestra, Chorus, French/Conversational French, Technical Education, Music, Applied Math, Gateway, and other groups/organizations/classes.

He was also known outside the realm of medicine for his studies and works on the geography and history of Colombia. He also served as President of the then Sovereign State of Antioquia and as Senator of Colombia. Life Manuel Mar√≠a Uribe Ang√©l was born on 4 September 1822 in la Magnolia, the hacienda of his parents Jos√© Mar√≠a Uribe Arango and Mar√≠a Josefa √Ångel Uribe, both from an educated and well to do family in the town of Envigado, in what was then the Province of Antioquia, now Antioquia Department, during the First Republic or Gran Colombia. As customary in those times, he was baptized the following day in the parish church of Saint Gertrude in Envigado by Felipe de Restrepo. And years later confirmed in the Roman Catholic faith by the 1st Bishop Antioquia Mariano Garnica y Dorjuela. =Education= His education began in his home town and first taught by Alejo Escobar, and during his youth worked as secretary of the doctor Nicol√°s de Villa Tirado; the lack of proper education in Antioquia given the fresh independence of the nation, forced Uribe to depart to the capital of the country, Bogot√° where he began his studies on 18 October 1836 at the High College of Our Lady of the Rosary, where he was a student of both his brother Wenceslao, and his uncle Pedro Uribe Arango who were professors at the institution. After graduating from Our Lady of the Rosary, he moved on to study Medicine at the Central University of the Republic, from where he graduated in 1844 as Doctor in Medicine and Surgery. After graduating he moved for a short time back to Antiquia, but soon began a life of travelling, living in Quito, Ecuador where he received an honorary degree in Medicine from the Central University of Ecuador, from then to Peru, the United States, and finally to Paris, France, where he lived for two years specializing his medical training. Upon his return to Antioquia he married Magdalena Urreta Saldarriaga in 1854, and remained in the country for a good time, practicing medicine, now a renowned man in his field. Manuel Uribe √Ångel developed a renowned fame not only as a doctor, but as a versatile and all- around intellectual socialite. In 1871, after the creation of the Department of Medicine of the University of Antioquia, he joined the institution as a faculty professor of medicine, French, Gross Human Anatomy, Physics, Residency, among others. He was a founder member, 1st and 3rd President of the Academy of Medicine of Medell√≠n, and during the first National Congress of Medicine of Colombia was designated honorary president of the congregation. Member of the Colombian Academy of the (Spanish) Language, and the Colombian Academy of History, and on 2 December 1903 he was named first president of the Academy of History of Antioquia. =Politics= In 1875, he traveled again to the United States, this time not only as a mere tourist but as representative of his Government to the United States for the occasion of the Centenary of the death of Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra. On this occasion he also travelled to Mexico, and the Antilles, but on his return to the country due to the events of the Colombian Civil War of 1876, and the similar wars from then on, he began to venture in to the realm of politics as a member of the Colombian Liberal Party. In 1877, Uribe participated as Deputy of Antioquia during the constituent assembly, becoming its President, and on 10 April 1877 Uribe was elected President of the Sovereign State of Antioquia, a state in the United States of Colombia. His administration was challenged by the growing tensions between Liberals and Conservatives, Antioquia being a Conservative state was under attack by the Liberal Federal government and under the Military lead of Juli√°n Trujillo Largacha, who succeeded Uribe on 31 October 1877 in power after crushing of Conservative forces. Uribe √Ångel was sent to the Sovereign State of Panama to Represent Antioquia at the groundbreaking ceremony for the Panama Canal on 1 January 1880. In 1882, as a member of the Liberal party, Uribe √Ångel was elected Senator of Colombia. =Death= Bust by Jairo Cano E. of Manuel Uribe √Ångel, located along Avenue la Playa, Medell√≠n. Inscription reads: ‚ÄúEminent Doctor. Governor of Antioquia.‚Äù Manuel Uribe √Ångel died on 16 June 1904 in Medell√≠n at the age of 81. He had been blind his last seven years, and was only survived only by his widow Magdalena, as they never had children. After his death his body was interred in the San Pedro Cemetery. His memory was kept alive as a man of wisdom and science, the Congress of Colombia passed a law commemorating his death and allocating a special endowment to have two oil painting made to consecrate his image, one for his widow and the other to be displayed at the Library of Zea. In his home town of Envigado there is both a hospital and a educational institute for secondary education that carry his name. The Academy of History of Antioquia, honored his contribution by creating the medal Order of the Centenary of Manuel Uribe √Ångel, that grants those individuals that contribute to the history of Antioquia, its study, or its preservation; President √Ålvaro Uribe V√©lez received such distinction on 26 March 2008 Works The following is a list of selected works by Manuel Uribe √Ångel in Spanish, some of his works were only published after his death.

Born in Mooroopna, Victoria, he was educated at state schools and was a volunteer firefighter in his home town,Mooroopna Fire Brigade records, 1941 before serving in the military from 1945 to 1947, after which he became a sports journalist and broadcaster. In 1960, he was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Bendigo, narrowly winning a by-election for that seat that followed the death of Percy Clarey.Colin Cleary (1999), Bendigo Labor. The Maintenance of Traditions in a Regional City, Epsom (Victoria), p.147 Melbourne newspaper The Age later reported that his 133 vote winning margin was probably because of the donkey vote, but his personal following grew steadily ‚Äúuntil it reached about 1500 in 1966, a time when Labor‚Äôs Australia-wide vote was at an all-time low.‚ÄùArticle, \\"Political spirit goes haunting\\", The Age, 20 May 1969.

For his achievements, he was widely considered a potential Minister in a Labor government. As a local MP however, Beaton took greater pride in the many small victories he won for individual residents of his sprawling regional electorate. He was particularly proud of his success in helping save Bendigo's Chinese Joss House. Discovering that elderly members of the Chinese community were still using the derelict building as a place of worship, but had to do so in secret because it was on Defence Department land, he persuaded the Department to hand over the land for the benefit of the community. The Joss House was eventually restored and opened to anyone who wanted to worship there or just learn about the city's rich Chinese heritage. Beaton retired from parliament on 9 April 1969, and never again held political office. His personal following at the time he retired from politics was such that both Labor and Liberal candidates in the resulting by-election publicly claimed to aspire to being like him. After retiring from political office, Beaton returned to journalism, running the editorial side of regional daily newspaper the Bendigo Advertiser during the early 1970s. In that role, he helped to rescue the city's historic town hall from planned demolition, with a front- page article that caused angry public protests. Beaton died in 2004.

Fought on the ƒåegar hill situated between the villages of Donji Matejevac and Kamenica near Ni≈° in what is today southeastern Serbia, it ended in an Ottoman victory. Commander Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá famously blew up the gunpowder magazine when the Ottomans overtook his trench, killing everyone in it. Skulls of dead Serb rebels were embedded into the Skull Tower. Background On April 15, 1809, the 10,000 Serbian rebels approached the villages of Kamenica, Donji and Gornji Matejevac, near the Fortress of Ni≈° with Miloje Petroviƒá as Commander-in-chief. They made six trenches. The first and the biggest one was on ƒåegar Hill in charge of vojvoda Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá. The second one was in the village Gornji Matejevac with Petar Dobrnjac as the commander. The third trench was north-east to Kamenica with vojvoda Ilija Barjaktareviƒá. The fourth trench was in Kamenica with Miloje Petroviƒá as the chief commander. The fifth trench was in the mountain above Kamenica and under the control of vojvoda Paulj Matejiƒá while the sixth one was in Donji Matejevac. The Ottoman commander of the fortress was Hurshid Pasha who had 8,000 troops in the fort and the surrounding area. The Serbs then launched several attacks against the Ni≈° Fortress, but they could not take the fort due to lack of heavy artillery. In such circumstances, their strategy was to force Hursid Pasha to surrender with the long siege. But Hurshid had different tactics; after every Serbian attack, he was offered negotiations and this way he bought time while fresh troops arrived. Meanwhile, on 20 May the Ottoman army was reinforced with 20,000 soldiers from Rumelia. One Ottoman unit then tried to surround the Serbian troops, 30 km east of the town. Hajduk-Veljko and his 2,000 soldiers then left their position, and moved to prevent the Ottoman attack from their rear approach. This manoeuvre further weakened Serbian positions on the main front line. The Ottoman troops attacked on the trench of Petar Dobrnjac on 30 May. The following day, on 31 May 1809, the most prominent trench at ƒåegar Hill, under the command of Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá, was under attack. Battle Hursid Pasha Stevan Sinƒëeliƒá at Battle of Chegar Hill. The battle lasted for the whole day. Stevan and his unit became separated from the remainder of the Serb guerrilla positions and he and his men resisted fiercely. With hundreds of Ottoman soldiers pouring into the trench, Stevan saw that his Brigade had little hope of staving off the Ottoman offensive. Hand-to-hand combat ensued in the trenches. Stevan decided to fire his flintlock pistol into a pile of gunpowder kegs. When the Ottomans swarmed the trench from all sides and headed for him, Sinƒëeliƒá squeezed the trigger. As Milovan Kukiƒá witnessed: It was earlier believed that the Serbian defeat at Kamenica was due to Miloje Trnavac, a commander of the Ni≈° front. Aftermath ƒÜele kula (1883) by ƒêorƒëe Krstiƒá. The Skull Tower was built from the heads of slain Serbs. The fall of Sinƒëeliƒá's trench forced the other Serbian units to retreat back to the town of Deligrad, where they entrenched themselves in a new, fortified front line. When Hurshid Pasha realized this, even though the post at ƒåegar hill had been taken, he ordered that the heads of the Serb victims be collected, skinned, and that the skulls be built into the \\"Skull Tower\\". This tower was built along the road to Constantinople, as a warning to anyone revolting against the Ottoman Empire. The Serbian defeat meant the loss of initiative in the war, which lasted until 1813. Thousands of Serbian revolutionaries and Ottoman troops were killed on ƒåegar Hill. In 1815 the Second Serbian Uprising began under the leadership of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. ReferencesSources  Further reading * *Vukiƒáeviƒá, M.

It is a feature predominately relegated to minibuses and buses to provide a large entrance or exit for passengers without obstructing the adjacent pathway between the vehicle and any adjoining object or the side(s) of passenger and commercial vans so as to allow a larger unobstructed access to the interior for loading and unloading.Use of sliding doors in minivans and MPVs . Conventional styles Sliding doors are often used on the outside of mini MPVs such as the Toyota Porte and Peugeot 1007 and Renault Kangoo, but are more commonly used in full-sized MPVs like the Toyota Previa, the Citro√´n C8, the Peugeot 807, the Chrysler Voyager and the Kia Sedona., What Car? talking about MPV's with sliding doors. Their use has increased over the years as MPVs have increased in popularity, because it gives easy access and makes parking in tight spaces possible. The most common type of sliding door, that has a three-point suspension and opens outwards, then runs along the side of the vehicle, was introduced in 1964 by Volkswagen AG as an option on its Type 2 vans. =Pocket doors= Delivery van - visible in this picture is the pocket door that slides rearward into the side. A Kaiser Darrin - visible in this picture are the pocket doors that slid forward into the fender. A pocket door is a sliding door that slides along its length and disappears, when open, into a compartment in the adjacent wall, or as in terms of vehicles, into the vehicle's bodywork. Pocket doors are used in some delivery vans, as well as Renault Estafette and Morris J4 and train carriages such as the London Underground 1973 Stock, but rarely in cars. = Buses = A \\"sliding plug door\\" on a bus has a pantographic hinge that moves the door panel outwards from its plug socket and then parallel to the side of the bus to clear the opening. On closing, the door is wedged and locked into the opening. This arrangement makes a very good airtight and soundproof seal and is commonly found on coaches. = Passenger trains = ICE train Many passenger train carriages use plug doors. On commuter and regional trains doors of plug design take less room than sliding doors, but may restrict the compatibility of a car with high passenger platforms since these doors open outwards. High-speed trains use sliding plug doors because they can be made airtight, soundproof and reduce aerodynamic drag. Unconventional styles 1953 Kaiser Motors = Kaiser was the first and only car manufacturer to feature pocket doors, although not all of their cars had pocket doors., jaylenosgarage.com talking about the Kaiser., Info on the Kaiser, with pictures. To date, no other car has utilised pocket doors. Their unique pocket doors slide tidily into the front fender, which leaves the vehicle looking a lot more aesthetically pleasing than the doors sliding outside of the bodywork. =Inner-Track sliding door= Opens normally like a traditional van sliding door, but unlike most sliding doors where the track is on the exterior of the vehicle, this type has it inside and on the side of the door itself. This allows the exterior to remain clean in design and yet the door can slide outside past the trailing edge of the car. However, this design is very unusual and can only be found on the Mitsubishi RVR (Space Runner, not ASX). Invented by Mitsubishi Motors, it was designed because the RVR is a short car compared to the size of the siding door, making it incapable of having a track on the exterior of the car. Thus, the inner-track mechanism was used so the sliding door can slide open wide enough to let passengers enter and exit the car easily. The new Mitsubishi EK Wagon/Nissan Otti also uses this type of sliding door, but has it only on one side while the driver's side door of the back seats is a normal hinge door. The sliding door of the EK wagon is also electric-powered. =Vertical doors= A vertical door is a type of sliding door that slides vertically, usually on a rail or track. 1989-1991 BMW Z1 A BMW Z1 with its doors open The BMW Z1's unusual vertical-sliding doors are one of its most interesting features. The doors slide-vertically down into the car's chassis. This means that they slide into a compartment within the car's body and so are also technically pocket doors, but they are not classified as such because they do not slide along their length into an adjacent compartment. The inspiration for these doors came from traditional roadsters which often feature removable metal or cloth doors. Because removable doors did not fit within BMW's design goals, the vertical-sliding doors were installed instead. Because the doors slide vertically downwards into the body, the top halves of the sides of the car slide into the bottom half. The high sills can make entry and exit harder, although they do offer crash protection independent of the doors, so the vehicle may be legally and safely driven with the doors up or down. BMW never imported the Z1 to the U.S. They are legal in the U.S., but only when the car is imported under the NHTSA's Show & Display exemption for technologically and historically significant vehicles. The windows can be operated independently of the doors, although they will automatically retract if the door is lowered.http://www.bmwz1.co.uk/ 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII concept car The Lincoln Mark VIII concept car's doors slide into the frame underbody and disappear from view., A video of the door working. By doing this, it eradicated the problem of a high door sill that the Z1 experienced. However, this design is much more complicated, so the risk of failure is increased. Also, all of the mechanisms to make the doors work add a significant amount of weight to the car, slowing it down, and making it less efficient. This was designed because Lincoln executives were concerned about the large heavy doors on the Mark VIII and wanted to improve them, especially for cities with tight parking spaces. They had the idea of a Mark VIII that had doors that disappeared beneath the car and would require no additional space outside the car's wheelbase for the doors to open in order to allow people to enter or exit. At this time it was usual for the large car manufacturers to sub- contract their concepts to other companies who specialized in making concepts reality. In this case, this Mark VIII was sent to Joalto near Detroit. Joalto still holds many US Patents for with this vehicle's chassis and body construction., eBay information and pictures., One of Joalto's patents., One of Joalto's patents., One of Joalto's patents., One of Joalto's patents. Joalto Design Inc. created this one-of-a-kind concept car and shipped it to Lincoln for executive approval for production. The executives disliked the design and ordered the prototype destroyed. Instead, the vehicle was sold on eBay in September 2007.

It also referred to radio stations in Germany which broadcast anti-Nazi material. The term has not been in general use since the downfall of the Third Reich. Background As early as 1929, Soviet Radio Moscow broadcast German-language radio programs, mainly to support the agitation by the Communist Party of Germany against the Weimar government. After the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933, anyone caught by the Gestapo listening to Radio Moscow could be sent to a concentration camp. The Nazis attempted to jam the broadcasts, this however also affected their own Deutschlandsender transmissions. In 1936 the Reich Ministry of Justice decreed that anyone listening to Radio Moscow could be prosecuted for treason. Secret Gestapo reports attested to the popularity of German-language programs aired by foreign radio stations. Various new laws and prohibitions were put in place following the start of the second world war. One of the new law, introduced on 1 September 1939 (the first day of the German Invasion of Poland), was the \\"extraordinary radio-measures act\\" (). The law prohibited deliberate listening to any foreign radio station under threat of prison. Likewise all non- governmental radio transmissions were banned and the two-way radios used by German amateur radio operators were seized by the Reichspost. Persecution The BBC came to be regarded as the main Feindsender, and listening to the German-language longwave program from London was punishable with imprisonment. Broadcasts like Thomas Mann's Listen, Germany! were still widely heard. Radio Moscow, Voice of America, Vatican Radio and the Swiss Berom√ºnster radio station were other widely known Feindsender. Black propaganda broadcasters disguised as German armed forces stations like British Soldatensender Calais or Gustav Siegfried Eins and German pirate radio stations were also popular. German citizens (Reichsb√ºrger) denounced for violating the prohibition could expect to get off with warning for a first offence, or an arrest for a repeat offence, if they were listening to something relatively innocuous like comedy or jazz. However, spreading information considered demoralising was punished with incarceration or even with the death penalty. Death sentences were seldom based solely on radio listening but ‚Äî in the cases of Helmuth H√ºbener and Walter Klingenbeck ‚Äî rested on convictions for high treason or Wehrkraftzersetzung. Estimates vary of how many listeners the Feindsender had. According to Sicherheitsdienst reports, a large-scale campaign in 1941, charging Nazi Blockleiter to visit the households in their area and attach warning paper tags to receiving sets, met widespread discontent. The author of Berlin Embassy, a bilingual American who traveled widely in Germany in 1939-40, estimated that 60 percent of Germans secretly listened to foreign broadcasts at low volume. Listening to foreign radio stations has been dubbed \\"the little man's resistance\\" because, together with being friendly to forced laborers (also a crime, and punished even more harshly), and taking detours to avoid passing a Nazi memorial where one would be forced to salute (the Viscardi Way or \\"Shirkers' Way\\" in Munich) it was very common and, later, could allow individuals to claim they had never really been a Nazi.

Enacted following the September 11 attacks in the United States, the Act was designed to better address contemporary terrorism issues, both domestically and abroad. Until May 2019, the Act had not been formally used in a prosecution; however there were several failed attempts by the Crown to do so.Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305. Many individuals and organisations have however been designated as \\"Terrorist entities\\" under the Act's provisions, in line with UN Security Council designations.\\"Lists associated with Resolution 1337\\" (20 July 2014) NZ Police http://www.police.govt.nz/advice/personal- community/counterterrorism/designated-entities/lists-associated-with- resolution-1373. The Act was amended in 2007.Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act 2007. In May 2019, a charge of engaging in a terrorist act was laid against the alleged shooter in the Christchurch mosque attacks, under section 6A of the Act. Background New Zealand, considered a relatively 'safe' country, has experienced few terrorist incidents in its short history. Prior to 2001, incidents included the bombings of the Huntly rail bridge in 1951, the Whanganui Computer Centre in 1982, the Wellington Trades Hall in 1984 and the Greenpeace vessel The Rainbow Warrior in 1985.B.K. Greener-Barcham \\"Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand\\" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 510‚Äì514. Contrary to the popular association between terrorism and insurgency, the latter two of the four were perpetrated by state or state-aligned actors, as noted by Omar Hamed.Operation 8 (2011) Directed by Abi King-Jones and Errol Wright [Film] New Zealand: Cutcutcut films. Due to these incidents, New Zealand had already established prior to this act, \\"A comprehensive legislative and substantive counter-terrorist framework...\\"B.K. Greener-Barcham \\"Before September: A History of Counter- terrorism in New Zealand\\" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 514. However the growth of international terrorism in recent years, alluded to by then Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Phil Goff in the bill's first reading, gave rise to the need to introduce new, \\"comprehensive\\" anti-terror legislation.(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001. The examples he gave were the Lockerbie bombing, the World Trade Centre bombing and the Nairobi embassy attack.(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001. PassageIntroduction= Goff introduced the Terrorism (bombings and financing) bill to parliament on 3 May 2001.(3 May 2001) 591 NZPD 9001. Seen by many as simply the enactment of two recent international conventions, the bill was considered unremarkable and garnered widespread lukewarm support.New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties \\"Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001.\\" The bill was then sent to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade select committee for review and submissions. September 11 attacks and select committee The day of the attacks, a special ministerial statement session was held at the beginning of parliament, in which Deputy Prime Minister Jim Anderton, amongst others, gave their condolences for those killed, with Anderton moving a motion to express New Zealand's \\"shock and horror\\" at the events.(12 September 2001) 595 NZPD 11614. What followed was a dramatic shift in pace at the select committee level, with many submitters feeling that they did not have enough time to review and make submissions on the increasing amendments that the committee was making in the wake of the attacks.New Zealand Council for Civil Liberties \\"Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001.\\" Proponents of the bill claimed that this urgency was a matter of necessity given the threat posed by terrorism, however opponents claimed that this legislative process eroded the public's right to proper consultation. For instance in its submission on the bill the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Aotearoa), an organisation with consultative status with the United Nations, claimed to be, \\"dismayed at the extremely short length of time\\" and did not, \\"consider such a time period to be sufficient for...such a complex, and extreme, piece of legislation.\\"Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (Aotearoa) \\"Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001.\\" This was echoed in the submission by the Human Rights Commission, stating that, \\"There has been limited opportunity for public discussion and preparation of submissions.\\"Human Rights Commission \\"Submission to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee on the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) Bill 2001.\\" Nonetheless, the New Zealand government, following several other governments around the world, broadened its own powers in the bill. Greener- Barcham claims that this was in order, \\"To be part of a broader anti-terrorist effort\\" and to, \\"Strengthen ties with 'like-minded states'\\" following the September 11 attacks and President Bush's call to arms.B.K. Greener-Barcham \\"Before September: A History of Counter-terrorism in New Zealand\\" (2002) Australian Journal of Political Science at 514. This shift in mentality was reflected in the bill's renaming from the Terrorism (Bombing and Financing) bill to the Terrorism Suppression bill. =Final readings and royal assent= Due to the alterations made in the select committee stage, the bill became hotly debated during the committee of the whole house. For example, Green Party Member of Parliament Keith Locke proposed (unsuccessfully) an amendment which would have changed the bill's name to the, \\"Civil Liberties Reduction\\" bill.(8 October 2002) 603 NZPD 1090. Despite strong dissent from the Green Party, the bill passed its third reading on 8 October 2002 with multi-party support and 106 votes in favour, with only the 9 Green votes against.(8 October 2002) 603 NZPD 1148. The bill received royal assent and became an act on 17 October 2002. Content of ActPart 1= Part 1, \\"Preliminary Provisions,\\" deals with the purpose of the act and its interpretation.Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss1-6. =Part 2= Part 2, \\"Suppression of Terrorism,\\" forms the substantive part of the act's offences.Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss6A-61. It also deals with some of the other most significant aspects of the act, the designation of terrorist entities, organisations and individuals, in sections 20‚Äì42. It creates the offences of: *Section 7: terrorist bombing *Section 8: financing terrorism *Section 9: dealing with terrorist property *Section 10: making property available to a terrorist entity *Section 12: recruiting members for terrorist groups *Section 13: participating in a terrorist group *Section 13A-D: harbouring terrorists, using plastic explosives, protecting or acquiring radioactive materials =Part 3= Part 3, \\"Miscellaneous provisions,\\" deals primarily with the obligations on the New Zealand attorney general.Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss62-81. These include to: *Section 64: Indicate if New Zealand will exercise jurisdiction under the act *Section 65: Give notification if an individual is taken into custody under the act *Section 67: Give permission for prosecutions under the act *Section 68: Communicate the outcome of any such prosecution The penalties within the act are severe, with most offences carrying either 14 years or life imprisonment (the harshest penalty available in New Zealand).Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, ss6A-61. 2007 New Zealand police raids In October 2007, the NZ Police carried out several raids across New Zealand and arrested 17 individuals, charging them under the Terror Suppression Act for involvement in so-called \\"military style training camps.\\"Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305. For the prosecutions to go ahead the attorney general's consent under section 67 of the act was required. Under delegated authority from then Attorney General Michael Cullen, then solicitor general David Collins announced on 8 November 2007 that he was: As a result of this decision, the charges under the act were dropped as were any form of prosecution of the vast majority of those arrested. Only firearms charges against four of the accused were eventually successful.Hamed v R [2012] 2 NZLR 305. Because of Collin's criticism that the act was, \\"Unnecessarily complex\\" and, \\"Incoherent\\" he recommended the act be sent to the law commission for review.David Collins, Solicitor General of New Zealand \\"Press Release regarding prosecutions under Terrorism Suppression Act\\" (Wellington, New Zealand, 8 November 2007). Amendment Act 2007 Following the 2007 raids, the government introduced a major overhaul of the act (an amendment bill was already before parliament). The amendment was to correct inconsistencies with UN and UN Security Council requirements and replace the role of the High Court in extending terrorist designations with the prime minister.Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007 (explanatory note). It also introduced new \\"nuclear material\\" provisions.Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s14. Of most significance was the amendment's redefining of several of the offences in the act: *Section 12 (recruiting members of a terrorist group) now simply required a designated terrorist entity (DTE)Terrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s11. *Section 13 (participating in a terrorist group) introduced a recklessness component alongside knowledge, as well as only requiring a DTETerrorism Suppression Amendment Bill 2007, s12. In doing so, the threshold to commit either offence was considerably lowered, in large part to correct the issues highlighted by the solicitor general. The Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act 2007 came into force on 19 November 2007. Criticism The Act as a whole has been criticised by some as placing too much power in the hands of the executive. Whereas the court formerly made findings of fact, in regards to the designation of terrorist entities the responsibility has been given to the prime minister. Such a designation carries with it strict penalties under the act in terms of association and membership. Some have claimed that this may lead to the act being used politically to quell dissidents rather than actual terrorists.Cameron Walker \\"The Terrorism Suppression Act\\" (1 April 2014) New Zealand Human Rights Blog http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/uncategorized/the-terrorism-suppression-act-and- criminalisation-of-national-liberation-groups/. Human rights groups have also raised concerns over whether convictions based on a wrongful designation will nevertheless remain upheld.Cameron Walker \\"The Terrorism Suppression Act\\" (1 April 2014) New Zealand Human Rights Blog http://nzhumanrightsblog.com/uncategorized/the-terrorism-suppression-act-and- criminalisation-of-national-liberation-groups/. The most recent periodic review of the act (in line with the review regime within the act) was cancelled in 2013 by then Justice Minister Judith Collins.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. It includes St. Mary's Seminary Chapel, which is a National Historic Landmark. It also includes Mother Seton House, briefly home of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, separately listed on the National Register. Seton Hill, Baltimore's former second French Quarter, is centered on the former St. Mary's Seminary and College, which was founded by Sulpician priests fleeing the French Revolution (1789-1795) around 1791. Today Saint Mary's Park is situated where the former Seminary and College buildings once stood. The neighborhood was designated as an Historic and Architectural Preservation District of Baltimore City in 1968, and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Saint Mary's Park, the heart of Seton Hill, is the largest open green space in downtown Baltimore on its Westside. In 1790, the first Roman Catholic prelate ordained for the new United States, Bishop John Carroll met with Father Nagot of the Order of St. Sulpice and agreed to a plan for the establishment of the Sulpician Order in Maryland. A year later priests of the order, journeyed across the Atlantic Ocean with Fathers Nagot, Tessier, Garnier, and Levadoux opening the Sulpician headquarters in the old One Mile Tavern, then located at West Franklin Street and the Hookstown Road, (known today as Pennsylvania Avenue). The Sulpicians soon purchased the inn, adapting it to a small seminary, and in future years they completed an extensive college and seminary complex along North Paca Street in the area of the existing Seminary structures in 1806, with a second replacement group of buildings in the 1870s. St. Mary's thus became the first Roman Catholic seminary in the United States, celebrating its 175th Anniversary there in 1966 (four years before they were razed in 1970 creating the current park) at its older Paca Street campus of Victorian architecture which it had left in 1929 for its later elaborate Beaux Arts / Classical Revival style architecture and expansive campus on Roland Avenue and Northern Parkway in the Roland Park neighborhood of North Baltimore. There it later celebrated its Bicentennial in 1991. The only original St. Mary's academic structure remaining is a particularly significant building located on the old Seminary grounds is a small red brick chapel, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Presentation, which was dedicated in 1808. This structure, designed by J. Maximilen M. Godefroy, a prominent architect of the time and teacher at the secular college attached to the seminary, is one of the oldest remaining example of Gothic Revival architecture in the U.S. Frenchman Godefroy also designed several other structures including the city's War of 1812 memorial to its casualties of the Battle of Baltimore during the British attack in September 1814 of the iconic landmark Battle Monument (1815-1822), situated at the old colonial era Courthouse Square on North Calvert Street, between East Fayette and East Lexington Streets. It commemorates the Battle of North Point in southeast Baltimore County and the Royal Navy's bombardment of Fort McHenry guarding the Baltimore Harbor & Port. The monument serves as a symbol of the city on the municipal seal and city flag and logo to this day since 1827.

Postprandial somnolence (colloquially known as the itis, food coma, food drunk, after dinner dip, or postprandial sleep) is a normal state of drowsiness or lassitude following a meal. Postprandial somnolence has two components: a general state of low energy related to activation of the parasympathetic nervous system in response to mass in the gastrointestinal tract, and a specific state of sleepiness. While there are numerous theories surrounding this behavior, such as decreased blood flow to the brain, neurohormonal modulation of sleep through digestive coupled signaling, or vagal stimulation, very few have been explicitly tested. To date, human studies have loosely examined the behavioral characteristics of postprandial sleep, demonstrating potential shifts in EEG spectra and self-reported sleepiness. To date, the only clear animal models for examining the genetic and neuronal basis for this behavior are the fruit fly, the mouse, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.  Physiology  Adenosine and hypocretin/orexin hypothesis = Increases in glucose concentration excite and induce vasodilation in ventrolateral preoptic nucleus neurons of the hypothalamus via astrocytic release of adenosine that is blocked by A2A receptor antagonists like caffeine. Evidence also suggests that the small rise in blood glucose that occurs after a meal is sensed by glucose-inhibited neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. These orexin-expressing neurons appear to be hyperpolarised (inhibited) by a glucose-activated potassium channel. This inhibition is hypothesized to then reduce output from orexigenic neurons to aminergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic arousal pathways of the brain, thus decreasing the activity of those pathways. = Parasympathetic activation = In response to the arrival of food in the stomach and small intestine, the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system increases and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system decreases. This shift in the balance of autonomic tone towards the parasympathetic system results in a subjective state of low energy and a desire to be at rest, the opposite of the fight-or- flight state induced by high sympathetic tone. The larger the meal, the greater the shift in autonomic tone towards the parasympathetic system, regardless of the composition of the meal. = Insulin, large neutral amino acids, and tryptophan = When foods with a high glycemic index are consumed, the carbohydrates in the food are more easily digested than low glycemic index foods. Hence, more glucose is available for absorption. It should not be misunderstood that glucose is absorbed more rapidly because, once formed, glucose is absorbed at the same rate. It is only available in higher amounts due to the ease of digestion of high glycemic index foods. In individuals with normal carbohydrate metabolism, insulin levels rise concordantly to drive glucose into the body's tissues and maintain blood glucose levels in the normal range. Insulin stimulates the uptake of valine, leucine, and isoleucine into skeletal muscle, but not uptake of tryptophan. This lowers the ratio of these branched-chain amino acids in the bloodstream relative to tryptophan (an aromatic amino acid), making tryptophan preferentially available to the large neutral amino acid transporter at the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. Uptake of tryptophan by the brain thus increases. In the brain, tryptophan is converted to serotonin, which is then converted to melatonin. Increased brain serotonin and melatonin levels result in sleepiness. = Insulin-induced hypokalemia = Insulin also can cause postprandial somnolence via another mechanism. Insulin increases the activity of Na/K ATPase, causing increased movement of potassium into cells from the extracellular fluid. The large movement of potassium from the extracellular fluid can lead to a mild hypokalemic state. The effects of hypokalemia can include fatigue, muscle weakness, or paralysis. The severity of the hypokalemic state can be evaluated using Fuller's Criteria. Stage 1 is characterized by no symptoms but mild hypokalemia. Stage 2 is characterized with symptoms and mild hypokalemia. Stage 3 is characterized by only moderate to severe hypokalemia.  Myths about the causes of post-prandial somnolence  Cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery = Although the passage of food into the gastrointestinal tract results in increased blood flow to the stomach and intestines, this is achieved by diversion of blood primarily from skeletal muscle tissue and by increasing the volume of blood pumped forward by the heart each minute. The flow of oxygen and blood to the brain is extremely tightly regulated by the circulatory system and does not drop after a meal. = Turkey and tryptophan = A common myth holds that turkey is especially high in tryptophan, resulting in sleepiness after it is consumed, as may occur at the traditional meal of the North American holiday of Thanksgiving. However, the tryptophan content of turkey is comparable to chicken, beef, and other meats and does not result in higher blood tryptophan levels than other common foods. Certain foods, such as soybeans, sesame and sunflower seeds, and certain cheeses, are high in tryptophan. Although it is possible these may induce sleepiness if consumed in sufficient quantities, this is not well- studied. Counteraction A 2015 study, reported in the journal Ergonomics, showed that, for twenty healthy subjects, exposure to blue-enriched light during the post-lunch dip period significantly reduced the EEG alpha activity, and increased task performance.

Giuseppe Grandi (1843‚Äì1894) was an Italian sculptor. Life Grandi was born and died in Valganna. Taught by Vela at the Accademia di Brera, in 1866 he won the Canonica competition with a sculpture called Ulisse and began to work on a verist sculpture of Tabacchi at Turin. After his Turin period, he returned to Milan, where he joined the Lombard Scapigliatura school. He was a friend of Cremona and Ranzoni, and with them assumed a renewed anti-academist position and shared their common luministic research. Forgetting neoclassical smoothness and the lucidity of Romantic art, he sought the luministic effects of painting in sculpture. One of his best- known works is the monument to Cesare Beccaria of 1871, along with the lesser- known paggio di Lara of 1873 and his Maresciallo Ney of 1874. In 1881 his initial design won a public competition to create a monument to the Five Days of Milan in piazza di Porta Vittoria in Milan. For thirteen years he worked intensively at compositions, modelli, bronze casting, and even created a small menagerie of animals as live models for the work. For each of the Five Days he had many different and well-known models pose, but he died in 1894, before he could see his work inaugurated. The city of Milan has renamed a piazza after him.

In the fields of anthropology and linguistics, Oceania is often subdivided into Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, while also including Australasia. In archeology and prehistory, Oceania extends into the southern Pacific Rim of Asia, especially the islands now comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Study of the history, economics, and politics from the colonial period on is inextricably bound to that of the major colonial powers: Britain, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, Russia, the United States, and later Australia, New Zealand, and Indonesia. For many Pacific Islanders, Pacific studies involves projects of cultural renaissance, the reclamation and reassertion of cultural identity, while for many others, Pacific studies tends to focus more on modernization and development, on how to understand the region in ways that will improve people's lives (Firth 2003). Wesley-Smith observed that a third rationale for Pacific Studies, particularly amongst outsiders to the Pacific, was driven by geopolitical considerations evident in Area Studies.

She was a 22-gun snow, and, at in length, the largest British warship on the Great Lakes at the time. The shipwreck was discovered in 2008. Ontario was found largely intact and very well preserved in the cold water. The wreck discoverers asserted that \\"the 80-foot sloop of war is the oldest shipwreck and the only fully intact British warship ever found in the Great Lakes.\\"  History  Ontario was built in 1780 on Carleton Island, a major base in the St Lawrence River for the British during the Revolutionary War, but now part of New York. She was operated by the Royal Navy for the Provincial Marine in the capacity of an armed transport. At the time, Ontario was the largest British warship to sail on the Great Lakes. She was launched just five months before she sank, and was used to ferry troops, supplies and prisoners from one remote part of New York to another. She never saw battle. Sinking Ontario sank in a storm on 31 October 1780 while underway from Fort Niagara to Oswego. Approximately 80 men perished with the ship,Some sources say 172 comprising an estimated 31 sailors (two of whom were officers), three members of the Royal Artillery (one being an officer), three privates and one officer of the 8th (King's) Regiment of Foot, 30 men of the 34th (Cumberland) Regiment of Foot (one being an officer, two serjeants, one corporal, one drummer and 30 privates), two rangers, one passenger and four Native Americans . News of the sinking of Ontario was kept quiet for a number of years to hide the naval loss.  Search and discovery  Side-scan sonar technology was used in the search of HMS Ontario in late May 2008. A promising wreck was found between Niagara and Rochester, New York in an area of Lake Ontario where the depth exceeds . The sonar imagery clearly showed a large sailing ship resting upright at an angle, with two masts reaching up at least above the bottom of the lake. The high resolution images showed the remains of two crow's nests on each mast, strongly suggesting that the sunken vessel was the brig-sloop Ontario. Due to the depth limitations for diving on this shipwreck, a remotely operated underwater vehicle was deployed and confirmed the identity of the ship in early June 2008. Kennard and Scoville believe that the cold, fresh water of Lake Ontario, combined with a lack of light and oxygen, have slowed decomposition and account for the ship being found largely intact, despite being on the bottom for 230 years. The shipwreck's discoverers have notified the New York State Office of Historic Preservation, however the exact location of the wreck has not been publicly disclosed. The wreck is still property of the United Kingdom and is a war grave.

History One of the Baku (Southland Times, 7 November 1903) The Southland Times was first established in 1862. The first edition was published on 12 November 1862 under the title of Invercargill Times. The three founders were Gerard George Fitzgerald, John T. Downes, and Charles Reynolds. The name changed to The Southland Times in June 1864. Initially, it was published two or three times a week until it became a daily paper in 1875. From 1869 until its purchase by the INL (Independent Newspapers Limited), it was owned by the Gilmour family. Robert Gilmour became a part owner in 1869‚Äì70, and then in 1879 became the sole owner of the paper. In 1972, digital computers and software, phototypesetters, and a Japanese APR photopolymer plate were installed at the paper, making the Times New Zealand's first fully computerised newspaper production system under the direction of Ian Gilmour. The paper changed hands again on 1 July 2003, when Independent Newspapers Limited was purchased by Australian media company Fairfax Media.The Southland Times: a division of Fairfax Media In May 2012 local printing of The Southland Times ceased with all printing now taking place from Allied Press in Dunedin.

Superconductivity is characterized both by perfect conductivity (zero resistance) and by the complete expulsion of magnetic fields (the Meissner effect). Changes in either temperature or magnetic flux density can cause the phase transition between normal and superconducting states.High Temperature Superconductivity, Jeffrey W. Lynn Editor, Springer-Verlag (1990) The highest temperature under which the superconducting state is seen is known as the critical temperature. At that temperature even the weakest external magnetic field will destroy the superconducting state, so the strength of the critical field is zero. As temperature decreases, the critical field increases generally to a maximum at absolute zero. For a type-I superconductor the discontinuity in heat capacity seen at the superconducting transition is generally related to the slope of the critical field (H_\\\\text{c}) at the critical temperature (T_\\\\text{c}):Superconductivity of Metals and Alloys, P. G. de Gennes, Addison-Wesley (1989) :C_\\\\text{super} - C_\\\\text{normal} = {T \\\\over 4 \\\\pi} \\\\left(\\\\frac{dH_\\\\text{c}}{dT}\\\\right)^2_{T=T_\\\\text{c}} There is also a direct relation between the critical field and the critical current ‚Äì the maximum electric current density that a given superconducting material can carry, before switching into the normal state. According to Amp√®re's law any electric current induces a magnetic field, but superconductors exclude that field. On a microscopic scale the magnetic field is not quite zero at the edges of any given sample ‚Äì a penetration depth applies. For a type-I superconductor, the current must remain zero within the superconducting material (to be compatible with zero magnetic field), but can then go to non- zero values at the edges of the material on this penetration-depth length- scale, as the magnetic field rises. As long as the induced magnetic field at the edges is less than the critical field, the material remains superconducting, but at higher currents the field becomes too strong and the superconducting state is lost. This limit on current density has important practical implications in applications of superconducting materials ‚Äì despite zero resistance they cannot carry unlimited quantities of electric power. The geometry of the superconducting sample complicates practical measurement of the critical field ‚Äì the critical field is defined for a cylindrical sample with the field parallel to the axis of radial symmetry. With other shapes (spherical, for example), there may be a mixed state with partial penetration of the exterior surface by the magnetic field (and thus partial normal state), while the interior of the sample remains superconducting. Type-II superconductors allow a different sort of mixed state, where the magnetic field (above the lower critical field H_{c1}) is allowed to penetrate along cylindrical \\"holes\\" through the material, each of which carries a magnetic flux quantum. Along these flux cylinders the material is essentially in a normal, non-superconducting state, surrounded by superconductor where the magnetic field goes back to zero. The width of each cylinder is on the order of the penetration depth for the material. As the magnetic field increases, the flux cylinders move closer together and eventually at the upper critical field H_\\\\text{c2}, they leave no room for the superconducting state and the zero-resistivity property is lost. Upper critical field The upper critical field is the magnetic flux density (usually expressed with the unit tesla (T)) that completely suppresses superconductivity in a type-II superconductor at 0 K (absolute zero). More properly, the upper critical field is a function of temperature (and pressure) and if these are not specified, absolute zero and standard pressure are implied. Werthamer‚ÄìHelfand‚ÄìHohenberg theory predicts the upper critical field () at 0 K from and the slope of at . The upper critical field (at 0 K) can also be estimated from the coherence length () using the Ginzburg‚ÄìLandau expression: .Introduction to Solid State Physics, Charles Kittel, John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

It has no sixth form. Location It is situated on Upton Lane (A114). Nearby to the west is the Newham College of Further Education, and further west is the site of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Opposite the school is West Ham Park. History Stratford Grammar School, Upton Lane, originated in 1906, when West Ham Municipal Central Secondary (mixed) School was opened in Whalebone Lane and Tennyson Road, in buildings for 680, planned by the school board as a higher elementary school. The initial intake of 369 included the pupil-teachers from two centres opened by the school board in 1894 and given permanent buildings in Russell Road (1896) and Water Lane (1897). The last preparatory pupil-teachers were selected in 1909, and from 1912 bursaries were granted to intending teachers who followed a full secondary course. This bursary scheme ended in 1936. The school was enlarged in 1914, c.1920, and again in 1931. Between the two world wars, when attendance was about 600, its reputation was very high. The word 'Central' was dropped from its name in 1925. The school was partly destroyed by bombing in 1941, after which some temporary huts were added. It was renamed Stratford Grammar School in 1945, and in 1958 it was transferred to new buildings on the site of the former Upton Lane school. In 1960 the Head Teacher was Mr Arnold G Burness and there was a four form entry of about 120 pupils per year. There was also a lower and upper sixth form. It became a sixth-form-entry comprehensive in 1972. The school officially gained academy status on 1 August 2011. It gets GCSE results well above average. Tradition When the school moved to the newly developed Upton Lane site in 1958 a statue of an owl was mounted near the main entrance. The owl was said to represent wisdom, but as the owl also featured on the school uniform logo pupils were known locally as members of the Ollie Beak fan club. This was a reference to the owl puppet on the popular children's TV programme Tuesday Rendezvous with this name. At this time pupils were assigned to one of four houses: Fry (green), Gurney (blue), Langthorne (yellow) and Lister (red) named after Elizabeth Fry, Samuel Gurney, Stratford Langthorne Abbey, and Joseph Lister. Before 2005 the school uniform consisted of purple blazers, however it changed in September 2005 to black. Each year group has colour-coded badges. Each pupil is also in one of six houses, Curie, Noether, Euler, Crick, Hawking, Berners-Lee; each denoted by a different colour stripe on their tie.

Andi Durrant and Nick Riley met whilst DJing together at Sheffield super- club Gatecrasher in 2002 and have been producing music since 2003. Most notable for their UK radio shows and residencies at Privilege Ibiza, Riley & Durrant have been influential in playing and promoting underground electronic music in the UK for the last 10 years.  Radio  Between them, Riley & Durrant formerly presented two specialist dance programs on the Galaxy FM network, including Andi Durrant's Saturday Warmup and their Friday night showcase for underground, unsigned and unheard electronic music. Andi Durrant now presents Friday and Saturday night's on The Capital FM Network across the UK They also run their own production company Distorted Productions Ltd, making specialist radio shows, documentaries and idents for UK and international radio stations. In 2007 Andi Durrant won the bronze award at the Sony Radio Academy Awards. In 2008 he received the much coveted Gold Award as Music Broadcaster of the Year, and in 2009 he won the Silver award for best Specialist Music Program. They have also previously been heard on Vonyc Radio in Germany, and regularly on Dubai 92, Global Radio and HFM Ibiza.  DJ highlights  They have played at most of the UK dance festivals from Creamfields to Global Gathering and played internationally across Russia, Asia, USA and Europe. They are one of the few British acts to have played at the Fort Dance festival in St Petersberg, where they did their first live set in 2004. On New Year's Eve 2007/08 Riley & Durrant headlined their own event on the world's largest man-made beach in Kaula Lumpur, Malaysia. Andi and Nick have been regulars in Ibiza during the summer months, playing at the world- famous Caf√© Mambo, and broadcasting live from Amnesia, Space and Eden. For the 2008 and 2009 Ibiza seasons Riley & Durrant were part of the biggest night in Ibiza when they were asked to be weekly residents at Privilege Ibiza (Worlds Biggest Club) to provide the sound of the second room at Ti√´sto‚Äôs sell-out concerts and warm up for him in the main room. In 2010 Riley & Durrant will be playing the Terrace for rival club Cream at Amnesia with Calvin Harris. Most weekends Riley & Durrant can be found playing across Britain from the famous superclubs like Cream, Gatecrasher, Ministry of Sound and Godskitchen, to smaller more intimate venues around the country.  Studio  In 2008 Nick and Andi opened a recording studio in Leeds City Centre with fellow Leeds residents The Utah Saints.  Music & releases  The first few Riley & Durrant releases in 2003 sat firmly in the trance and melodic genres, on European record labels like Black Hole and United, including their debut track \\"Candesco\\" (of which only 500 copies were ever pressed onto vinyl but subsequently became a collectors classic, with copies going for over ¬£50 on eBay). Over the subsequent years, Riley & Durrant have become difficult to pigeon-hole musically, with support for their music coming from a wide cross section of DJs ‚Äì from underground house heroes like Laurent Garnier, Krafty Kuts and Sander Klienenberg to superstars Armin Van Buuren, Laidback Luke, Axwell, Paul Van Dyk and Tiesto. There's no doubt Riley & Durrant are no longer part of the international trance scene, having developed their music and DJ sets into a much broader house-focussed sound, although they often straddle house, progressive and techno, and also play Drum 'n' Bass and Breakbeat on their radio programs. Their debut artist album \\"Research & Development\\" was released summer 2007, and reached the iTunes top 50 in the first month of sales, receiving great critical acclaim for its unique genre- bending sound: * \\"Adventurous and experimental ‚Äì 4 Stars\\" ‚Äì IDJ Mag * \\"Without a doubt the best artist album of the year\\" ‚Äì Contactmusic.com * \\"This album will cross boundaries\\" ‚Äì Dancenode * \\"Quirky but Cool\\" ‚Äì Mixmag * \\"This only serves to emphasize how far R&D; have come ‚Äì 4/5\\" ‚Äì DJ Magazine Alongside their commercial releases, Riley & Durrant have written a number of pieces of music for film and television, such as Sky One and ITV.  Record label  In 2007 Andi and Nick launched their Nu Breed Music record label to put out some of the vast amount of tracks they were being sent by young up-and-coming music producers for their radio shows.

Following her death in 1758 her body was embalmed and kept above ground, to be periodically checked for signs of life. The method of embalming was not recorded, but it probably involved replacing the blood with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion. The body was then put in an old clock case and stored in the house of Beswick's family physician, Dr Charles White. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a local celebrity, and visitors were allowed to view her at White's house. Beswick's mummified body was eventually bequeathed to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she was put on display and acquired the soubriquet of the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. The museum's collection was later transferred to Manchester University, when it was decided, with the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, that Beswick should finally be buried. The ceremony took place at Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death; the grave is unmarked. Background Antoine Wiertz's L'Inhumation pr√©cipit√©e (The Premature Burial), 1854 The mid-18th century saw an upsurge in the public's fear of being mistakenly buried alive, and much debate about the uncertainty of the signs of death. Various suggestions were made to test for signs of life before burial, ranging from pouring vinegar and pepper into the corpse's mouth to applying red hot pokers to the feet, or even into the rectum. Writing in 1895, the physician J. C. Ouseley claimed that as many as 2,700 people were buried prematurely each year in England and Wales, although others estimated the figure to be closer to 800. Hannah Beswick was born in 1688, the daughter of John and Patience Beswick, of Cheetwood Old Hall, Manchester, she inherited considerable wealth from her father who died in 1706. Some years before her own death, one of Hannah's brothers, John, had shown signs of life just as his coffin lid had been about to be closed. A mourner noticed that John's eyelids appeared to be flickering, and on examination the family physician, Dr Charles White, confirmed that he was still alive. John regained consciousness a few days later, and lived for many more years. Jessie Dobson, Recorder of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, has said that there appear to be many \\"inaccuracies and contradictions\\" in accounts of the events following Beswick's death in 1758. Many suggest that she left ¬£25,000 (equivalent to about ¬£ as of ) to White, a pioneer of obstetrics and one of the founders of the Manchester Royal Infirmary, on the condition that her body was kept above ground, and that periodically she was to be checked for signs of life. Beswick's will however, dated 25 July 1757 (less than a year before her death), states only that White was to receive ¬£100 (¬£ as of ), and that ¬£400 (¬£ as of ) was to be allocated for funeral expenses. Some accounts have suggested that White was an executor of Beswick's will and that he received the ¬£400 himself, from which he was permitted to keep any surplus after the funeral expenses had been paid. Having Beswick embalmed therefore allowed him to keep the whole amount. Alternatively it has been suggested that White was considerably in debt to Beswick, a debt that would have to be repaid after the funeral, which was avoided by her embalming, but Beswick's will names Mary Graeme and Esther Robinson as her executors, not White. In 1866, more than 100 years after her death, the details of Beswick's will were still being disputed. Embalming Charles White There is no mention in Beswick's 1757 will of her desire to be embalmed. It has been suggested that White had been asked to keep Beswick above ground only until it became obvious that she was actually dead, but that he was unable to resist the temptation to add a mummy to his collection of \\"wet and dry\\" exhibits, and so made the decision to embalm her. White had developed a particular interest in anatomy while studying medicine in London and was building up a collection of \\"curiosities\\", which by the time of his death included the skeleton of Thomas Higgins, a highwayman and sheep-stealer hanged for burglary, as well as Hannah Beswick's mummy. The method of embalming used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 he had studied under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore it is likely that White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it. Display Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell. There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death. Treasure and alleged apparitions Bonnie Prince Charlie entered Manchester at the head of his invading army in 1745, causing Beswick some apprehension over the safety of her money, which she therefore decided to bury. Shortly before her death she promised to show her relatives where the treasure was hidden, but she did not survive long enough to do so. Her home, Birchin Bower, was converted into workers' tenements following her death. Several of those living there claimed to have seen a figure dressed in a black silk gown and a white cap, and described it as Hannah Beswick. After gliding across the house's parlour, the apparition would vanish at one particular flagstone. It is claimed that while digging to fit a new loom, a weaver living there discovered Beswick's hoard of gold, hidden underneath that same flagstone. Oliphant's, a Manchester gold dealer, paid the weaver ¬£3 10s for each gold piece, the equivalent of almost ¬£ in . Birchin Bower was eventually demolished to make way for a Ferranti factory, but sightings of the apparition were still reported. When Beswick's family home, Cheetwood Old Hall was demolished in 1890 to make way for a brickyard, contractors discovered a double coffin buried underneath the drawing room, the mystery of the burial was never solved but at the time it was thought to be connected to the Beswick family and Dr White who had resided at the hall after Hannah Beswick removed to Oldham.

He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1984 to 1998, representing the Liberal Party. He was Speaker of the House from 1996 to 1998, and subsequently served as Ambassador to Ireland from 1998 to 2003. Early life Halverson was born in Melbourne. At the age of 16, as an air force cadet, he was one of four Air Training Corps members chosen to fly to England and meet Sir Winston Churchill. Halverson served in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) from 1956 to 1981, attaining the rank of group captain. He was seconded to the British Royal Air Force's RAF Support Command for a period, for which he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1978. Politics Halverson was elected to federal parliament at the 1984 federal election, winning the Division of Casey for the Liberal Party. He attracted attention in 1989 when he referred to government MP Elizabeth Harvey as \\"baby\\" during question time in the House of Representatives. He refused Harvey's call for an apology, stating that it was a gender-neutral term and was not sexist. In 1990, Halverson was appointed Opposition Whip in the House of Representatives under the new party leader John Hewson. He was stripped of the position when his relationship with Hewson broke down after the 1993 election defeat, but regained it in May 1994 when Alexander Downer became leader. He subsequently assumed the title Chief Opposition Whip. After the Coalition's victory at the 1996 federal election, Halverson was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. He resigned the position in March 1998 as the Howard government became frustrated at his impartiality in enforcing discipline on both Government and opposition MPs and allowing supplementary questioning of ministers when answers were evasive. He usually wore the Speaker's traditional gown, but without the wig.

The consumer edition for iOS and Android, BBM Consumer, was developed by Indonesian company Emtek under licence from BlackBerry Limited (formerly known as Research In Motion). The consumer edition for BlackBerry OS and BlackBerry 10, as well as the paid enterprise edition, called BBM Enterprise (BBMe, formerly known as BBM Protected), were developed fully by BlackBerry Limited and continue to function. BBM Consumer for Android and iOS was shut down on 31 May 2019, however the paid enterprise version of the software, BBMe, is still supported on these platforms. Messages sent via BBM were sent over the Internet and used the BlackBerry PIN system. In the past, many service providers allowed sign-in to BBM using a dedicated BlackBerry data plan. Exchanging messages was possible to a single person or via dedicated discussion or chat groups, which allowed multiple BlackBerry devices to communicate in a single session. In addition to offering text-based instant messages, BBM also allowed users to send pictures, voicenotes (audio recordings), files (up to 16 MB), share real time location on a map, stickers and a wide selection of emojis. Communication was possible only among BlackBerry devices, until late 2013 when BBM was released on iOS and Android systems. Over 300 million Stickers were shared. Daily, approximately 150,000 BBM Voice Calls were placed. There were more than 190 million BBM users worldwide as of 2015, and BlackBerry infrastructure handled 30 petabytes of data traffic each month by early 2013. BBM was the original \\"mobile-first\\" messaging service,http://trauring.org/history-of- messaging-where-its-going/ and was popular for a while before it started to lose out to rivals.http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/09/why-did-cross- platform-bbm-fall-over-so-quickly/ As of April 2016, Indonesia was the only country where BBM was the most popular messaging app ‚Äì installed on 87.5% of Android devices in the country.https://www.similarweb.com/blog/worldwide- messaging-apps History BlackBerry Messenger was launched on August 1, 2005. With the release of BlackBerry Messenger 5.0, BlackBerry allows users to use a QR Code to add each other to their respective friends lists rather than using only numeric PIN identification or an email address associated with the user's BlackBerry. Recent BlackBerry devices can also exchange BBM contacts using Near Field Communication technology. Users can also set animated gif pictures as their display pictures, although animated pictures have a 32KB size limit. The release of BlackBerry Messenger 6.0 introduced additional traits. This update is focused on social communication mediums, including 'BBM Connected Apps', which allow the user to invite friends to share their favourite BlackBerry Applications. Older logo In late-December 2011, the audience measurement company BBM Canada sued RIM for infringing its trademark of \\"BBM\\" by using it as an initialism for BlackBerry Messenger; BBM Canada used it as an initialism for its former name, the Bureau of Broadcast Measurement. The company cited that it had received phone calls from users who believed that they were connected to RIM. However, RIM asked for the case to be dropped, as the two organizations were in different industries. The suit was dismissed, and BBM Canada ultimately re-branded as Numeris. With the release of BlackBerry Messenger 7.0 in December 2012, voice chat (BBM Voice Call) was introduced. BBM Protected, a \\"secure\\" encrypted enterprise-level messenger, was launched in June 2014.https://www.techtimes.com/articles/8634/20140617/blackberry-super-secure- bbm-protected-launched-take-that-nsa.htm On June 27, 2016, it was announced that Indonesia-based Emtek Group had acquired the licensing rights for BBM. BlackBerry Limited would provide the BBM API to Emtek as part of the six-year, $207 million deal. In 2017, the BBM servers moved from a data center in Canada to a Google Cloud Platform-based data center in Asia.https://venturebeat.com/2017/06/15/blackberrys-bbm-is-moving-from-on- site-data-centers-in-canada-to-google-cloud-in-asia/ On April 18, 2019, BBM announced that they will discontinue the BBM for consumer service globally on May 31 that year (users can switch to a paid BBMe, the enterprise version of the messenger). Reliability BBM has been widely reputed for its uptime and reliability. However, on October 10, 2011 users of the service in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa were widely affected by an outage at provider RIM's UK headquarters in Slough, Berkshire. The outage lasted for two days, during which BlackBerry Messenger was reported to be unavailable, thus seriously affecting the company's reputation. Cross-platform BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins announced on May 14, 2013, that BlackBerry Messenger will be available on iOS and Android in the summer of 2013. This would mark the first steps of BlackBerry Messenger reaching beyond its own platform, as it had never been available on competing hardware before. It was rumoured that BlackBerry Messenger would launch on June 27, 2013 for Android and iOS. This was later denied by BlackBerry and an actual release date was yet to be announced. On June 21, 2013, A BlackBerry Messenger application was spotted on the Play Store. However, it turned out to be a fake. A worldwide release for BBM on Android was slated for September 21, 2013, which was officially announced by Blackberry. It was also announced that the app would require Android versions not older than 4.x.x (Ice Cream Sandwich & above) BlackBerry confirmed that BBM for iPhone would release on September 22, a day later after the official Android release and would work on iPhones running iOS 6 & later. However, during the worldwide rollout of BBM for Android and iPhone on September 21, 2013, 1.1 million Android users downloaded a leaked BlackBerry Messenger APK which caused BlackBerry to cease the launching of BlackBerry Messenger on both Android and iOS platforms. BBM was officially released on iOS and Android on October 21, 2013. 5 million downloads were recorded in the first 8 hours of its release. BBM, in late 2013, was the No.1 free app on both the App Store and Google Play Store.Esposito, Dom. October 22, 2013. Mashable \\"5 Million People Downloaded BBM for iOS, Android in Just 8 Hours\\" In total, the app had over 10 million downloads on the first day.

Nokia confirmed BBM would be preinstalled on Nokia X devices.BBM coming to Windows Phone and Nokia X platforms. 24 February 2014 As of June 2016, BBM was no longer offered on the Windows Store. On 27 June 2018, consumer features such as BBM Channels and paid content in the BBM Shop were discontinued on BB10 and BBOS devices. On April 18, 2019, it was announced that the BBM consumer service for Android and iOS will be shutting down on May 31, 2019. =Non-BlackBerry features= For now BBM for Multi- Platform will offer Personal Chats, Group Chat up to 250 people, Status Updates and can send or receive messages up to 2000 Characters.

The update included BBM Voice & BBM Channels.BBM beta update includes voice & channels. \\"BBM beta update\\" In February 2014, an update (2.0.0.13) was officially released to Android and iOS users containing the awaited features along with some other features including new emoticons and changes including a new look for Updates featuring choices to show All, Contacts or Channels filters. Security On November 4, 2014, BBM scored 1 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's \\"Secure Messaging Scorecard\\". It lost points because communications are not encrypted with a key the provider doesn't have access to (i.e. communications are not end-to-end encrypted), users can't verify contacts' identities, past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen (i.e. the app does not provide forward secrecy), the code is not open to independent review (i.e. the code is not open-source), the security design is not properly documented, and there has not been a recent independent code audit. The enterprise version, BBM Protected, initially scored 3 out of 7 points, but this was updated to 5 out of 7 points after additional information was provided by BlackBerry and reflected in the EFF changelog dated November 14, 2014. It lost points because past messages are not secure if the encryption keys are stolen and the code is not open to independent review. Userbase In May 2011, RIM claimed there were 43 million active BlackBerry Messenger users worldwide.https://www.cnet.com/news/blackberry- messenger-6-puts-the-chat-in-apps-and-games/ From 2013 to 2014, the number of BBM users increases sharply, up to over 100 million.

Heggen became an Oklahoman in 1935, when in the depths of the Depression his father's business failed and his family moved from Iowa to Oklahoma City for work. He was Wallace Stegner's cousin . Navy service After attending Oklahoma City University, Oklahoma State University, and graduating from the University of Minnesota, where he was classmate of Max Shulman, Thomas R. St. George and Norman Katkov, with a degree in journalism, Heggen moved to New York City and became an editor for Reader's Digest. He joined the U.S. Navy immediately after the attack on Pearl Harbor and was commissioned as a lieutenant in August 1942. For the duration of the War, he served on supply vessels in the North Atlantic, the Caribbean and the Pacific, the latter as assistant communications officer on the cargo ship USS Virgo and also the USS Rotanin. During his 14 months aboard the Virgo, Heggen wrote a collection of vignettes about daily life on the ship, which he described as sailing \\"from Tedium to Apathy and back again, with an occasional side trip to Monotony\\". Like his fictional alter ego Doug Roberts, he felt \\"left out\\" of the War and butted heads with his commander, a coarse martinet who repeatedly denied his requests for transfer to a destroyer. Mister Roberts Following his discharge in December 1945, he returned to New York and reworked the material into a loosely structured novel, adding an introductory chapter. His original title, The Iron-Bound Bucket, was changed to Mister Roberts by the publisher. Despite mixed reviews, it sold over one million copies and made Heggen the toast of the New York literary scene, followed by a lucrative offer to adapt the book for the Broadway stage. For this, he enlisted the aid of humorist Max Shulman but the collaboration did not work out. He then turned to producer-director Joshua Logan, who emphasized the work's farcical elements while retaining its serious undertones. With Henry Fonda in the title role, the 1948 stage version of Mister Roberts was a smash. Heggen and Logan shared the first Tony Award presented for Best Play. Death Bewildered by the fame he had longed for, and under pressure to turn out another bestseller, he found himself with a crippling case of writer's block. \\"I don't know how I wrote Mister Roberts,\\" he admitted to a friend. \\"It was spirit writing\\". He became an insomniac and tried to cure it with increasing amounts of alcohol and prescription drugs. On 19 May 1949, Heggen drowned in his bathtub at age 30 after an overdose of sleeping pills. His death was ruled a probable suicide, though he left no note and those close to him insisted it was an accident.

According to the 2016 Census there were 43,110 Canadians who claimed full or partial Macedonian ancestry. History Many Macedonians emigrated to Canada as \\"peƒçalbari\\" (seasonal workers) in the mid 19th and early 20th century. Thousands of Macedonians emigrated to Canada after the failure of the Ilinden Uprising. The first Macedonian organizations were the Zhelevo Benevolence Brotherhood and the Oschima Benefit Society St. Nicholas, both established in 1907 in Toronto by emigrants from Zhelevo (Antartiko) and Oschnima (Trigonon) in Aegean Macedonia. Other Macedonian organizations were soon established by emigrants from Zagorichani (Vassiliada), Oshtima (Trigonon), Smardesh (Krystallopigi), Gabresh (Gavros), Banitsa (Vevi), Buf (Akritas) and Tarsie (Trivuno), all villages in Aegean Macedonia. An internal census counted 1910 Macedonians in Toronto, who were principally from Florina (Lerin) and Kastoria (Kostur) then in Ottoman empire. In 1910 they established Sts. Cyril and Methody Macedono- Bulgarian Orthodox Church in Toronto, and that church published The First Bulgarian-English Pocket Dictionary in 1913. By 1940 there were claims that over 1200 Macedonian families were in Canada. Post-World War II and Greek Civil War migration cause the numbers of Macedonians in Canada to swell. Many early Macedonian immigrants found industrial work in Toronto, either as factory hands or labourers in abattoirs, or in iron and steel foundries. Many ended up running and owning restaurants, butchers and groceries. Macedonian entrepreneurs and their descendants eventually employed their numerical strength within the food service industry as a catapult into a variety of larger and more sophisticated ventures. Today, most Macedonian Canadians have moved out of cities and into the suburbs, and are employed in the professional, clerical, and service sector of the economy. The 2001 census recorded 31,265 Macedonians, while the 2006 census recorded 37,705 people of Macedonian ancestry. However, community spokespersons claim they number over 100,000. The Institute for Macedonians Abroad claims that there are 120,000 Macedonians in Canada.Nasevski, Bo≈°ko; Angelova, Dora.

They settled primarily in Ontario, especially Toronto. Many early Aegean Macedonian immigrants found industrial work in Toronto. Later migrants found work as factory in abattoirs and foundries. Chatham and Windsor attracted many Macedonian immigrants who worked along the railroads. Many later settled in Detroit, Michigan. Many Aegean Macedonians are parishioners of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. They set up many organizations, such as the Lerin Region Macedonian Cultural Association of Canada. In 1979 The Association of Refugee Children from Aegean Macedonia (ARCAM) was set up in order to unite the former child refugees from all over the world. It was reported that chapters had been set up in Toronto, Melbourne, Perth, the Republic of Macedonia, Slovakia, Czech Republic and Poland.Human Rights Violations Against Ethnic Macedonians-Report 1996, Macedonian Human Rights Movement of Canada, Toronto, 1996; p.111-112 Settlement patterns Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper with UMO President Dragi Stojkovski, 2009 Many Macedonians originally settled in industrial areas. Most Macedonians came to Canada via the process of chain migration. Organizations Many organizations have been set up by the Macedonians in Canada. Village associations from Banitsa, Osƒçima, Bouf and ≈Ωelevo have been set up. A Macedonian Boys' club was founded in Toronto in 1915. Community picnics were also very common amongst Macedonian immigrants. Macedonian basketball and hockey teams were founded. Fundraisers for assistance for the Greek Civil War and the 1963 Skopje earthquake were held. Other establishments, such as the Canadian Macedonian Restaurant Co-op (1970), Canadian Macedonian Business and Professional Association, Canadian Macedonian Historical Society and Macedonian Canadian Medical Society (1992) have been founded in recent years, along with the Macedonian Film Festival (2006). Youth organizations such as Macedonian Association of Canadian Youth, Ryerson Association of Macedonian Students and the Association of Macedonian Students at the University of Toronto are also in operation. Religion Originally Macedonian churches were established under the Bulgarian Diocese of America, Canada and Australia. The church Saint's Cyril and Methodius was consecrated in Toronto in 1910. This was followed by the St. George Macedono-Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the Holy Trinity Macedono-Bulgarian Church. Post-war immigrants built churches under the jurisdiction of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. They were St Clement of Ohrid, St Demetrius of Salonica, St Ilija, St Nedela and St Naum of Ohrid. There are two Macedonian cathedrals in Canada ‚Äì Toronto being the location of the largest Macedonian church community in Canada: St Clement of Ohrid in Toronto.

Founded on 24 July 2003. It indexed torrents from various major torrent websites, and offered compilations of various trackers per torrent that were not necessarily present in the default .torrent file, so that when a tracker was down, other trackers could do the work. It was the second most popular torrent website in 2012.  Usage  Torrentz's user interface was simple; it had only a user menu and a search panel. Users were not required to register before searching files. To perform a search, users would simply type in a string of keywords within the autocomplete-enabled search field and execute the search by either pressing the search button in the UI or the enter key on the keyboard. From there, a list of matching torrent files were displayed on the screen for the user to choose from. This list could be filtered by age (one day, three days, one week or one month) and by \\"safety & quality\\" (\\"any\\", \\"good\\" or \\"verified\\"). The \\"good\\" filter was applied by default, and \\"verified\\" was reserved for torrents uploaded by well- known groups. Selecting a torrent from the search results list would take the user to another page listing the websites currently hosting the specified torrent (with which users would download files). As Torrentz used meta-search engines, users would be redirected to other torrent sites to download content (commonly KickassTorrents, which was considered safe to use).  History  In November 2008, scammers using fake papers attempted to take over the torrentz.com domain. As a backup, the site administrator set up the domain torrentz.eu. After 18 December 2010, torrentz.eu became the site's default domain, due to the domain name seizures carried out by US authorities on various torrent websites. In 2013, Paramount Pictures sent a DMCA claim to Google to remove the Torrentz homepage and two other pages from its search engine. Torrentz counter-claimed on this request, claiming that the links did not infringe any copyright policies. On 26 May 2014, Torrentz had its domain name suspended without a court order following a request from the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit. A day later, the suspension of torrentz.eu was lifted. The website had three alternative domains (.me, .ch and .in) and hoped to move the .eu domain to a new registrar. All of these domains have since been blocked within the UK by Sky. On 5 August 2016, Torrentz was shut down by its operators with the message \\"Torrentz will always love you.

Following studies in Israel, he was a principal violinist of major orchestras, including the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was an international soloist, playing the first performance of Britten's Violin Concerto in Moscow. As a chamber musician, he was leader of the London String Quartet and recorded all Beethoven violin sonatas with pianist David Wilde. He was the lead violinist for The Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Gruenberg taught at the Royal Academy of Music until age 95, influencing generations of violinists.  Life and career  Gruenberg was born in Vienna in 1924, the son of Kathrine and Herman Gruenberg. He studied in Vienna and at the Jerusalem Conservatory. He was concertmaster of the Palestine Broadcasting Corporation Orchestra from 1938 to 1945. In 1946, he moved to London where he lived until his death, becoming a British subject in 1950. In 1947 he won the International Carl Flesch Violin Competition, which at the time came with no monetary prize but international recognition. Gruenberg appeared as a soloist in many countries. He gave the first Russian performance of Benjamin Britten's Violin Concerto, in Moscow. In his first concert at the Proms on 11 August 1971, he played Beethoven's Violin Concerto at the Royal Albert Hall, with the BBC Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult. In a 1983 concert, he played the Proms premiere of Alfred Schnittke's Violin Concerto No. 3, conducted by Edward Downes. He was Concertmaster of the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra from 1955, the London Symphony Orchestra from 1962 to 1965, and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra from 1972 to 1975. In addition, he was first violin with the London String Quartet (a later ensemble than the London Quartet), and he played chamber music on numerous occasions. Gruenberg taught at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama from 1982 and at the Royal Academy of Music in London from 1989, continuing to teach to age 95. He participated as an international music competition juror many times. Gruenberg made numerous recordings, including Beethoven's Violin Concerto with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Beethoven's complete violin sonatas with pianist David Wilde. He also played contemporary music such as works by Roberto Gerhard, Berthold Goldschmidt and Olivier Messiaen. In 1976, he played the first recording of David Morgan's 1966 Violin Concerto with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Vernon Handley. Gruenberg also played on several recordings by The Beatles, including as the lead violinist for their iconic album, Sgt. Pepper, on the songs \\"A Day in the Life\\", \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"Within You Without You\\". The group whimsically had him play wearing a prop gorilla paw on his bow hand.

The waterfall is high. Mahood Falls is also a small community spread out along of road east of Roserim Lake and south of Canim Lake. The population is about 50 people. There was a post office there until 1990, but presently there are no stores or services. Nearby Mahood Lake and, later, the Mahood Falls community were named after James Adam Mahood who was in charge of a Canadian Pacific Railway survey in this area in 1872.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . Joan Uhrig (n√©e McNeil) was born in 1935 at Canim Lake and grew up on the McNeil Ranch, now operated by the third generation of McNeils. According to her, the waterfall was unnamed during the family's early years at Canim Lake and considered to be part of nearby Canim Falls. When the post office was established in the 1950s and named Mahood Falls, tourists on the new road to Mahood Lake began asking for directions to see the waterfall. Answering repeatedly that there was no waterfall became so tiresome that the McNeils selected this waterfall to which they could send the curious tourists.Conversation with author Roland Neave in 2004 Only the community, not the waterfall, is an official name in the British Columbia Gazetteer. Access to Mahood Falls (the waterfall) is by a short trail off the Mahood Lake Road. Trail signage on the road says only 'Canim Falls'. It is a 10-minute walk to see Mahood Falls first, then 10 minutes further to see Canim Falls. Both are on the Canim River, downstream from Canim Lake, where there is a large island; the north channel goes over Mahood Falls and the south channel (which carries a lot more water) over Canim Falls. Formation Like many other waterfalls in Wells Gray Provincial Park, Mahood Falls owes its formation to the deposits of volcanic rock in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field. Layer upon layer of fresh lava created flat areas, over which enormous floods flowed at the end of the last ice age. These floods carved the canyons below Mahood Falls and Canim Falls. Erosion by wind and rain created a natural bridge in the cliffs beside the trail, one of only three in Wells Gray Park.

He was an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1910 to 1913 and 1914 to 1917, both times for the seat of Corio. Early life Born in Melbourne, he was the son of Marcel Charles Ozanne, a Frenchman, and his wife Emilia Josephine Reinhardt. He had one brother and three sisters. Ozanne married Edith Stewart Moody in 1900 and they had four children, all born at Werribee. He had been an accountant and municipal officer before entering politics, and was the bookkeeper for the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works' Werribee Sewage Farm at the time of his election. Politics Ozanne was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1910 federal election, defeating Liberal Richard Crouch. He lost his seat to Liberal William Kendell at the 1913 election, and while again out of parliament served as secretary of Labor's Corio campaign council. He returned to parliament at the 1914 election, defeating Kendell. =Controversy, defeat and aftermath= He volunteered for service in World War I in January 1916 while an MP; attended officer training at Tidworth, was promoted to lieutenant and was briefly attached to the Australian military offices in London before returning to camp at Larkhill. He was declared \\"unfit for further service\\" in January 1917 and was invalided home after visiting the front as a civilian in his capacity as an MP. However, in April, he was reported to have been absent without leave when his unit departed from the front in November 1916, and both media and his political opponents suggested that he had been \\"protected by headquarters\\", that would have been court-martialled had he not been discharged, and that he had pretended to have been on service in his letters during his visit to the front. He was defeated re-contesting his seat at the 1917 election, after the opposition refused to allow him to run uncontested due to the controversy over his war service; Ozanne attributed his defeat to the reporting of the affair. He sued the Geelong Advertiser for libel in 1920, but lost when it was held their coverage had been \\"substantially true\\". Later life Ozanne was declared insolvent in 1923, in part due to the legal costs from the libel case. At that time, he was working as a clerk and residing in the Melbourne suburb of Albert Park. He had moved to Brighton by 1935. Ozanne suffered serious injuries in a fall at the Middle Park railway station on 31 December 1959. He died at Brighton, Melbourne on 27 May 1961 and was cremated at Springvale Cemetery. He was the last surviving MP who served during Andrew Fisher's second tenure as prime minister.

It is drained by the Mahood River, a tributary of the Clearwater River which has cut a deep canyon into Cambrian rocks and Pleistocene glacial moraines. Mahood Lake is fed by the short Canim River, which drains nearby Canim Lake to the west via Canim Falls and Mahood Falls.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . The lake is 629 metres in elevation, 197 metres deep at its deepest point, approximately 33.5 km¬≤ in area, in length (east to west) and a maximum of in width. Mount Mahood is immediately south of the lake and rises to . Discovery and naming There are no written records about First Nations visits to Mahood Lake, but they did use this valley because pictographs can be seen about halfway along the south shore. The Mahood Lake area was the centre of considerable attention between 1872 and 1874 when three separate groups of Canadian Pacific Railway surveyors passed along its shores. Their objective was to find a feasible route for the railway from Yellowhead Pass in the Rocky Mountains westward to the Pacific Ocean. Marcus Smith, the head of British Columbia surveys, was a strong advocate for the major Pacific railway terminus being at the head of Bute Inlet, a fjord which penetrates the Coast Mountains some 225 km north of Vancouver. While examining his favoured route eastward from the inlet in September 1872, he spent a grueling few days traversing Mahood Lake's rugged northern shore. His diary contains a gripping account of the hazards along this route and a declaration that \\"These last two days were the hardest I have had on the surveys, and we were in constant danger.\\" His journey coincided with that of James Adam Mahood, who had been chosen by the C.P.R. in 1871 to head another survey party heading west to the Chilcotin. By chance, on September 17, 1872, the two expeditions met near the mouth of Mahood Lake. Smith and Mahood spent a day together comparing their notes and sketches. Between 1872 and 1881, about 20 survey parties fanned out across British Columbia to determine the best route for the new railway. The expeditions of Smith, Mahood and a third surveyor, Joseph Hunter, all visited what is now Wells Gray Park. When the more southern Kicking Horse Pass was chosen instead in 1881, all of these meticulously examined routes across the Canadian Cordilleran were abandoned. Only three place names in the Park recognize those 10 wasted years of surveys: Mahood River & Lake, Marcus Falls, and Murtle River & Lake (Murtle refers to Joseph Hunter's birthplace in Scotland). The lake was named for James Adam Mahood a land surveyor who died in 1901. He conducted a CPR survey along the shore of the lake in 1872. Mahood Lake Lodge In 1939, long-time settlers at Canim Lake, Benjie and Florence McNeil, built Mahood Lake Lodge at the west end of the lake. It was a log structure with dining room and lounge on the main floor and 13 guest rooms upstairs. For the next 20 years, the Lodge attracted celebrities for the excellent fishing in Mahood Lake and even earned a recommendation from Duncan Hines, the travel writer. The McNeils sold the Lodge in 1959 and moved to 100 Mile House where their seven children could attend school instead of relying on a correspondence education program. The Lodge burned to the ground in 1962. Mahood Lake Campground, operated by B.C. Parks, is now on the site of the Lodge. Geography This deep valley was carved by glaciers, but there are remnants of lava flows north of the east end of the lake and along the Canim River upstream. The Canim River is the major inflow. It is long, draining Canim Lake, and most of this distance is through a rugged gorge carved in lava. The river drops between the lakes, partly accounted for by two waterfalls, Canim Falls and Mahood Falls. The other major inflow is Deception Creek on the lake's north shore which has a high waterfall, Deception Falls. The outflow from Mahood Lake is the Mahood River. It is only long and drops over Sylvia Falls and Goodwin Falls before flowing into the Clearwater River. Access and trails The only road access to Mahood Lake goes to the west end from either Little Fort on the Yellowhead Highway #5 or 100 Mile House on the Cariboo Highway #97. Mahood Lake Campground has 34 campsites and is operated by the Wells Gray Park concessionaire. It has a sandy beach and a boat launching ramp. The Mahood Lake Road ends past the campground at Deception Point which is one of only three private properties within Wells Gray Park. There are four hiking trails near Mahood Lake Campground: Canim and Mahood Falls, Canim River, Whale Lake and Deception Falls. At the east end of Mahood Lake, there is a trail along the Mahood River past Sylvia and Goodwin Falls to the Clearwater River.

The population was 197 at the 2010 census. Beryl Junction Airport, a small, private airport, is located here. Geography Beryl Junction is located at (and specifically the name of) the junction of two state highways, SR-18 and SR-56, in the southwestern part of Iron County, some northwest of Newcastle. The city of Enterprise is about south, and the small community of Beryl is about north. Beryl Junction sits on the southern edge of the Escalante Desert. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. Most of it lies to the southeast of the junction itself. History In 1909, the New Castle Reclamation Company invested in land near the Beryl Crossroads in the Escalante Valley. The company built a hotel to bring prospective buyers, promoting the land for agricultural development. The venture failed around 1915, but the community has grown slowly since then as modern irrigation techniques have made the farmland productive. Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 197 people, 55 households, and 38 families residing in the CDP. There were 70 housing units, of which 99 were occupied. The racial makeup of the population was 54.3% White, 3.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 38.1% from some other race, and 4.1% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 51.8% of the population. Out of the 55 households, 52.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them. 49.1% had married couples living together. 14.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.58, and the average family size was 4.21. The population was 53.8% male, and the median age was 23.5 years. Education Elementary students attend Escalante Valley Elementary School, located right at the junction. Older students go to school in Cedar City.

Hudson Kensel (June 16, 1928 ‚Äì January 16, 2014) was an historian and author of the American West. He is professor emeritus from California State University at Fresno. At Fresno, he was the chairman of the Department of History. His early childhood was spent at Pahaska Tepee and Cody, Wyoming. He thereafter moved to the state of Washington where he completed his education. He is the author of Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill's Old Hunting Lodge and Hotel, A History, 1901-1946 and Dude Ranching in Yellowstone Country: Larry Larom and Valley Ranch, 1915-1969, published in 2010 by the University of Oklahoma Press at Norman, Oklahoma. Valley Ranch, one of the first of the western dude ranches, was established by the New York City native Larry Larom. Now privately owned, it is located on the South Fork of the Shoshone River in northwestern Wyoming.  Early life and education  The son of Willard F. \\"Bill\\" Wilkinson and the former Jessie R. Brenizer, Kensel was born in Kansas City, Missouri. He made his first trip to the West as a newborn when his family bought Pahaska Tepee, Buffalo Bill's hunting lodge near the east entrance to Yellowstone National Park. His childhood was spent at Pahaska in the summer months and in Cody during the school year. The family later moved to Ellensburg, Washington, where Kensel spent his high school years. Thereafter, Kensel served from 1946 to 1948 in the United States Army and was a part of the occupation forces in Japan. After completing his military service, Kensel attended the University of Washington at Seattle, where in 1951 he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and Business. He attended Central Washington University in Ellensburg and earned a Bachelor of Arts in education in 1952 and a Master of Education degree in 1955 with a thesis focusing upon \\"Local resource use in a junior high program in the Yakima Valley, Washington.\\" In 1962, Kensel completed his Ph.D. in history at Washington State University in Pullman, with his dissertation entitled, \\"The Economic History of Spokane, Washington, 1881-1910.\\" On April 4, 1969, he married the former Carol J. Jessup, with whom he reared four children.  Professional career  Upon earning his Ph.D., Kensel taught at Columbia Basin College in Pasco, Washington. In 1965, he joined the Department of History at California State at Fresno, where he served as assistant professor. In 1969, he became an associate professor and in 1973 he became a tenured professor. He was a visiting professor in the Department of History at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington, during the summers of 1974, 1975, and 1976. While at Cal State, Fresno, Kensel served as the Chairman of the Department of History from 1972 to 1982. He was named professor emeritus on his retirement in 2002. Kensel lived in Edmonds, Washington, and continued to research and write on topics related to western American history until his death on January 16, 2014. While conducting research in 2004 Kensel acquired a rare photo album of the Sunlight Ranch east of Cody. This photo album led Kensel to research the subjects in the pictures and in the Spring 2006 the Annals of Wyoming published, \\"Hope and Reality in the Sunlight Basin, Wyoming]: The Painter Family and John K. Rollinson.\\" While conducting research on the Sunlight Ranch and dude ranching, Kensel found his next research topic ‚Äì Larry Larom and Valley Ranch.

Flooding continued on the Upper Mississippi River in the southeastern portion of the state for several more days. The phrase \\"Iowa's Katrina\\" was often heard.\\"Editorial: Iowa's Katrina? Not if state does its part: Charity helps now, but eventually, state must pay,\\" Minneapolis Star Tribune, June 16, 2008, Retrieved June 22, 2008 The flooding included (from north to south, east to west), the Upper Iowa River, the Turkey, and the Maquoketa Rivers; outside of the Driftless Area, they include the catchments of the Wapsipinicon River and that of the Iowa River, to include the latter's major tributary, the Cedar River (and its significant tributaries); and the Skunk River in its various forks. The Des Moines River had some minor flooding, but floodwalls and levees for the most part held fast. The Upper Mississippi River which receives the outflow from all these rivers remained at flood stage. The flooding of Cedar Rapids and Iowa City were the most significant events. Recovery in particular for Cedar Rapids is considered to be a protracted and costly affair. For Iowa City, the level of damage was less than expected, but that of Cedar Rapids was greater than anticipated. In Iowa City, the campus of the University of Iowa was vulnerable, and serious flooding did occur there. President George W. Bush landed on Air Force One at The Eastern Iowa Airport on June 20. He toured on foot and by helicopter the Cedar Rapids and Iowa City region. On the same day, Senator John McCain made a stop in Columbus Junction.John Q, Lynch, \\"We're going to help you\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p.1AAssociated Press, \\"McCain tours flood-damaged Columbus Junction\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p.1B Origins State Meteorologist Elwynn Taylor of Iowa State University said that the wet spring of 2008 was traceable to relatively warm and wet air over the winter. Taylor explained: > \\"Fog in the winter is normally the result of a strong flow of warm, moist > air from the Gulf of Mexico, which normally does not occur in the winter,\\" > he said. \\"Usually that occurs in March and April. It's caused by either low > pressure over New Mexico or high pressure over Bermuda. Both are common in > the summer. Both are rare in the winter. More than 80 percent of moisture > that falls in the Midwest is from the Gulf of Mexico, and the primary cause > of it coming here is the Bermuda high pressure. The pressure arrived very > early and much stronger than usual by April and May this year. And it was > the case in 1993.\\" Taylor was quoted at length in the article, concluding: \\"Rule of thumb is, if a storm begins in the Texas Panhandle, it will come to Iowa. The conditions that allow a storm to develop there are the conditions that move the storm to Iowa.\\" The 2007-2008 winter was particularly severe in northeast Iowa, with a heavy snow cover that persisted in many areas until early spring rains. From the last week in April, the state experienced heavy rain, particularly in the form of thunderstorms, which saturated the soils. It was an extension of the Late-May 2008 tornado outbreak sequence, which aside from record-setting tornadoes, also brought huge quantities of rain in the form of stalled thunderstorm systems. Another possible, contributing factor was the extensive field tiling (installation of drain tile) in Iowa. Almost 40% of agricultural fields in Iowa are tiled, which allows water to flow more quickly from fields into waterways, possibly causing water levels to rise faster. Also, farming closer to creeks and rivers, without adequate buffer strips, allows the water to move rapidly from the field directly to the surface water. Effects Floodwaters fill the ditches surrounding Interstate 80 in Des Moines The Des Moines River threatened downtown businesses and prompted officials to call for a voluntary evacuation Map of affected watersheds (this includes the Illinois River but excludes the Upper Iowa) While the Great Flood of 1993 was greater in continental terms, in local Iowa terms, the June, 2008 Midwest floods were considerably worse. Lessons learned in 1993, however, helped prevent or otherwise ameliorate damage, extensive as it was; one example is how the city of Des Moines raised its levee around its domestic water and sewage treatment plants. The extent of flooding in 2008 was probably less than during the Flood of 1851, but it is difficult to compare impacts of the two floods because of changes in population, economy, and land use. A study performed by Mark Burton at the University of Tennessee and Michael J. Hicks at Ball State University was based on post 1993 flood data. However, the 2008 floods damaged key infrastructure outside of the model (e.g. the University of Iowa library) due both to changes in population and flood protection measures. However, the Burton & Hicks study did identify crop damages at roughly $3 billion, which turned out to be very close to the actual damages.http://cms.bsu.edu/Academics/CentersandInstitutes/BBR/CurrentStudiesandPublications/disasterStudies.aspx The flooding led to evacuations of many homes. In eastern Iowa along the Iowa River and Cedar River, flooding exceeded that of the Flood of 1993. Flooding also forced the closure of an extensive number of roads throughout the eastern half of the state, a situation that affected far more people than those who directly experienced the floods; in particular, portions of Interstate 80 and I-380 were closed. The closure of bridges in Waterloo, Cedar Rapids and Iowa City disrupted normal traffic patterns, and led to extensive detours. Rail traffic was also seriously compromised. The Iowa, Chicago and Eastern Railroad (IC&E; Railroad) had a washout between Mason City and Nora Springs. The Cedar Rapids and Iowa City Railway Co. (CRANDIC/CIC) was particularly affected; its bridge in Cedar Rapids was destroyed by the flooding while an embankment downriver near Coralville was also washed out. The Keokuk Junction Railway (KJRY) also reported disruptions. Amtrak service was rerouted, away from Iowa; a number of trains had their passengers put onto buses.\\"Significant damage to IC&E; rail lines from flood\\", Waterloo Courier, June 14, 2008, retrieved June 16, 2008 =Restoration of Amtrak service= Amtrak was due to restore service July 5, 2008 on its California Zephyr from Chicago to Denver.

The University of Iowa School of Art and Art History Art Building and Art Building West were heavily damaged by the flood. Hancher Auditorium took on floodwaters up to the stage level and into the middle of the main floor seats. The Voxman Music Building was filled up to the first floor level. The Theater Building was also significantly damaged by the flood. The University of Iowa Museum of Art was significantly damaged and the building was rendered uninsurable by Lloyds's of London, the art insurer (which means the art collection can never return to this site). On the east side of the river, the Adler Journalism Building, the Becker Communications Study Building all had water in their basements. The main library had only minor flooding, and then only in its basement. The Iowa Memorial Union took on water in its basement and first floor. Mayflower residence hall, home to about 1,000 students during the school year, took water into its underground parking and utility areas as well as into parts of the first floor.

Cedar Rapids began to be affected by the Cedar River on Monday, June 9. Ellis Boulevard NW near Ellis Park closed due to flood water. Water was nearly over the access road to the Ellis boat harbor on that Monday evening. By Tuesday morning, June 10, 2008, Edgewood Road from Glass Road NE to O Ave NW (including the bridge) was closed as flood waters overtook the western section of the roadway near the City Gardens area. Mid American Energy began terminating natural gas service to the Time Check and Osbourne Park neighborhoods of northwest Cedar Rapids around 5 p.m. on Tuesday, June 10. Alliant Energy reported that electrical service to the Time Check area would be terminated. However, power still had not been terminated by Wednesday, June 11 at 6:00 p.m. Cedar Rapids, Iowa was one of, if not the hardest hit area during the floods of 2008. The Cedar River crested at 31.12 ft (19 feet above flood stage) at 10:15 am on Friday, June 13, 2008, with the flood waters expected to fully retreat by June 24, barring any more heavy rains.Adam Belz, \\"C.R. struggles to grasp losses\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 14, 2008, p.1 The 1st Street NW Time Check Levee, built in the 1930s after the Great Flood of 1929 (20 ft crest), was completely submerged by the Cedar River, according to a KCRG-TV video captured on the morning of Thursday, June 12, 2008. A homeowner measured from the waterline on his house to a point equal to the top of the levee using a laser level and discovered that the levee had been under approximately 56 inches (4.5 feet) of water. About 1,300 blocks or 10 square miles, including most of the downtown area, were inundated, with more than 5,000 homes being affected. Mays Island (which included the Cedar Rapids city hall, the Linn County courthouse, the county jail, and the federal courthouse) was flooded up to the second floor level. Buildings that did not suffer any first floor damage had flooded basements. The Czech Village, Time Check, and Cedar Valley/Rompot districts in particular sustained significant damage. The city's domestic water distribution was compromised, as all but one of the city's wells were flooded, and water usage restrictions were imposed; however through a massive sandbagging effort the city's last remaining well was kept operational throughout the disaster. The river dropped faster than previously expected. A revised figure of was issued for the crest.Adam Belz, \\"Cedar River dropping faster than expected\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 15, 2008, p.1 Linn County moved most of its government offices, including the county courts, to the campus of Kirkwood Community CollegeRick Smith, \\"Linn moving most county offices to Kirkwood\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 16, 2008, p. 2A and later to a former Montgomery Ward store in Westdale Mall. Tremendous disruption to the city's utilities occurred. Electricity was cut off to the flooded parts of the city by the power company, Alliant Energy, as was natural gas; telephone and internet service was also disrupted.\\"School district hopes Internet back today\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. eB As the waters receded, flooded buildings were inspected by \\"strike teams\\" before owners were allowed to return and check out the damage. They used a color-coded system. Green meant the building was safe for occupancy, yellow meant entry should be limited and at one's own risk, red indicated serious damage/no entry, and purple was later used for buildings which were to be demolished. In biggest problems with homes were collapsing basements or foundations. In cases where water had reached the first floor or higher, there was failure of the floor joists, leading to a sagging or collapse into the basement.James Q. Lynch, \\"Homes rated by condition\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 1B The Time Check neighborhood is particularly hard hit, where several hundred homes were said to be beyond salvation and will be demolished.Steve Gravelle, \\"Many Time Check homes beyond repair\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 2B On the third anniversary of the disaster (June 12, 2011), Cedar Rapids was still rebuilding from the largest flood to ever hit. The City was yet to rebuild the main branch of its public library, the new federal courthouse was under construction, and the City government was in process of moving back to May's Island. These projects have since been completed. The iconic Dairy Queen on 1st Ave downtown is gone, along with several hundred homes that were razed, and many businesses that were not able to recover. On June 13, 2011, the replica of The Statue of Liberty was rededicated on May's Island after being washed away by the flood.

The 1928 Wurlitzer theater organ console was found to have floated up onto the stage and the wood of the console said to be a total loss.Adam Belz, \\"Mighty Wurlitzer pulled off Paramount stage, its future uncertain\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 1B The historic theater had recently completed an extensive restoration project prior to the flood. In July 2009, the city indicated that they had selected an architect to direct the reconstruction of the theater. While the interior of the building was heavily damaged, the structure of the theater remained relatively sound. The African American Cultural Center and Museum took on water up to the first floor, and it remains to be seen how much of its 1,700 exhibits can be salvaged.Jamie Kelly, \\"African American museum separating lost from saved\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 2B The National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library received water into the first floor area, with the loss of many artifacts and documents.National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library website, Retrieved June 20, 2008 The building was moved and elevated. The first floor of the main branch of the Cedar Rapids Public Library was filled with floodwater. With a collection of books said to be about 290,000, the entire adult section was lost, as was the reference section. The children's collection, however, was located on the unflooded second floor. Plans to expand the building and to increase the library levy were shelved.\\"A loss of literature\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p.3B On July 3, 2008, the library's director stated that the main branch may not reopen for at least three years, with the possibility open of moving to a new location altogether. In the meantime, the library leased additional space at Westdale Mall, where it already operated a branch. FEMA would not pay for rebuilding the main branch on the current, flood-prone site, so a property swap was effected with a commercial property owner away from the river; the new owner paid for renovation, and FEMA paid for a new library across the square from the city art museum. In 2013, the downtown branch of the library was completed by OPN Architects, a regional design firm located in Cedar Rapids. The project has received many awards in library design and construction by the American Library Association and American Institute of Architects. The Helen G. Nassif YMCA was badly damaged, with an estimated 7¬Ω feet of water on the first floor. The downtown facility was built in 2002 for a cost of $8 million.Pat Shaver, \\"Water swamps C.R.'s downtown YMCA\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p. 2B Repair progressed quickly, and the facility has reopened.. The Mother Mosque of America, the oldest building in the United States built specifically for use as a mosque, had its basement flooded, ruining a century's worth of documents and artifacts.. Theatre Cedar Rapids' basement, stage, and a large part of the auditorium was flooded. The Wurlitzer organ was heavily damaged and was rebuilt out of state; it is currently undergoing final installation before it is returned to use. The theatre was able to return to its downtown location in February 2009 after a massive rebuilding and remodeling effort. United States Courthouse Congress had earlier authorized a new United States Courthouse to replace the current crowded, outdated building located on 1st Street SE. Both of Iowa's senators were said to be pushing hard to move up the appropriation necessary to build the new facility, as it makes little sense to repair the current flood-damaged building.E. Michael Myers, \\"New courthouse 'makes sense'\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 4B As of 2013, construction has been completed on the new Cedar Rapids Federal Courthouse, and it is located across the street from the Helen G. Nassif YMCA on 8th Avenue Southeast. Law enforcement The flood greatly stressed the local police and sheriff's departments. Cedar Rapids Police Chief Greg Graham personally called Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan and asked for emergency assistance. Graham's officers had been working for over twenty-four hours straight. Minneapolis sent the first contingent of officers headed by Deputy Chief Rob Allen. The state activated the National Guard and sent about 750 of them into the city. Members of the Iowa State Patrol, the Iowa Department of Public Safety, and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation responded. Sheriff's departments from other Iowa counties also sent manpower. The federal government also deployed agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, ATF, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Nebraska State Patrol and Lincoln, Nebraska Police Department sent officers.Steve Gravelle, \\"Bridges opened; water rules eased\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 2A Officers from the Twin Cities area also showed up, including members of the Hennepin County, Minnesota sheriff's office, and officers from the Minneapolis, Bloomington and Saint Paul police departments, as well as Minnesota state troopers. The Hennepin County Sheriff's Dept. also supplied a portable repeater to assist in radio communications. The existing repeater had been knocked out by the flood waters.Brandt Williams, \\"Minneapolis officers on flood relief duty in Iowa\\", Minnesota Public Radio, June 17, 2008, Retrieved June 19, 2008 The list of all agencies that deployed to assist in Cedar Rapids alone is as follows: ATF Bloomington Minnesota Police, Cass County Iowa Sheriff, Decorah Iowa Police, Delaware County Iowa Sheriff, DEA, FBI, Hennepin County Minnesota Sheriff, ICE, Indianola Iowa Police, Iowa Air National Guard, Iowa Army National Guard, Iowa Department of Public Safety Enforcement, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, Iowa State Patrol, Iowa Navy Reserve, Jones County Iowa Sheriff, Lincoln Nebraska Police, Linn County Iowa Sheriff, Lisbon Iowa Police, Marion Iowa Police, Minneapolis Minnesota Police, Mt. Vernon Iowa Police, Nebraska State Police, Iowa Region 3 & 4 FUSION centers, St. Paul Minnesota Police, Toledo Iowa Police, US Coast Guard, US Department of Narcotics Enforcement, US Marshals Service, US Postal inspectors Police, US Treasury Department Enforcement, Warren County Iowa Sheriff, and West Branch Iowa Police All of this extra help was used to man roadblocks and barricades. Extra officers were also placed with Cedar Rapids Police officers to help patrol flood-affected areas, as well as handle excess calls for service generated by the flood. It was reported that officers from St. Paul Minnesota Police were noted as handling routine calls such as bar-checks in Marion, as well as FBI and ICE agents responding with Toledo Iowa Police to burglary calls in Cedar Rapids. The police department, located on the west bank of the river, was flooded and evacuated. By Friday, June 20, 2008, they had reoccupied the building as cleanup ensued.Adam Belz, \\"Police moving back into station\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p. 3A Economic losses Job losses were estimated to be in the 6,000‚Äì7,000 range. Officials urged those whose jobs were washed away by the flood to file for unemployment insurance, even those who might not be otherwise eligible, as disaster unemployment benefits were available.Carly Weber, \\"6,000-7000 job losses estimated\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p. 2A Business losses were considerable. Many small businesses were essentially wiped out, particularly in the Czech Village area. The Cargill plant was expected to reopen rapidly. Archer Daniels Midland expected to get its plant back online by the end of June.Dave DeWitte, \\"Assessing the damage\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p.8B Quaker Oats is a major employer in Cedar Rapids. Mark Schiller, Quaker's president, said, \\"We've been here for 140 years and we'll be here for another 140 years.\\" The plant has operated in Cedar Rapids since 1873. Schiller indicated that the plant was largely undamaged, and that the main impediment to full reopening was the lack of adequate electric service, as well as the fact that rail lines were closed.George C. Ford, \\"Quaker president says C.R. plant saying at 'home'\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p. 3A Recovery By Wednesday, June 18, the waters had receded greatly, leaving remnants only in the Time Check neighborhood on the west bank of the river and the Czech Village district, which lies on both sides of the river. Importantly, most bridges had been reopened, relieving the stress on the I-380 which had been the only crossing that remained open (and only then with severe restrictions on who could cross). While downtown became accessible, power remained off, and traffic signals were out; this is because transformers in underground vaults were still receiving water. Water restrictions which imposed limits on use were also eased, and people were allowed the use of showers and washing machines. By June, 2013, some residents were still struggling with the consequences of the flood. For nearly all, a \\"new normal\\" had been found, including a new sense of community.Kevin F.

The sandbagging continued until noon when they were allowed to stop. Later in the day the Army Corps of Engineers ordered that they continue sandbagging.The sandbagging started up around 5 pm and continued late into the night. Musco Sports Lighting sent a portable lighting truck to help the volunteers see at overnight. The sandbagging continued until about noon on Friday June 13 when the sandbagging was allowed to cease.

Over the course of the flood, Dubuque experienced only occasional flash flooding on the Little Maquoketa River or Catfish Creek. Lock and Dam No. 11 had its floodgates opened by the Army Corps to prevent the dam being overtopped by flood stage waters. =Quad Cities= Davenport June, 2008, showing erection of a temporary levee. The Mississippi River topped the flood stage in the Quad Cities on June 11, 2008. Davenport is the largest city bordering the Mississippi that has no permanent floodwall or levee. On June 12, 3.28 inches of rain fell in six hours at the Quad City International Airport courtesy of severe thunderstorms and high winds, breaking the record of rain fall, for that time period, adding major problems to the flooding. The rain caused not only Mississippi River flooding, but also flooding at Duck Creek. Duck Creek is a creek which winds through central Davenport. Duck Creek topped four feet over flood stage. Three of the seven main streets, including U.S. Route 61 which was being used as a detour for Interstate 80, that cross the creek were blocked off due to major flooding over the roads. The river is expected to crest on June 16, at which is over flood stage, then start falling shortly after. The river is expected to be down to by June 21, but won't be back to the flood stage until sometime during the week of June 22. The YouTube article \\"Lightning Hitting the Ground/Flooded Mississippi\\" is one of several videotaping shots which relates to the severe thunderstorms which created the flooding at Duck Creek during Thursday, June 12 and Friday, June 13. =Burlington= In the city of Burlington, the river played havoc with national transportation. In the early morning hours of May 1, 2008, five river barges came loose from their moorings at a staging area a short distance upstream of Burlington. While two ran aground before they reached the city, the remaining three struck the far eastern pier of the Great River Bridge with minimal impact. The bridge was closed to traffic until later the same afternoon, after the Iowa Department of Transportation inspected it and found it structurally sound. One of those barges continued downstream and became lodged under the Burlington Rail Bridge. After two unsuccessful recovery attempts, the 140-year-old rail bridge was partially reopened the following morning with the barge still wedged beneath. Flood waters caused the city to close off the area of the riverfront along Front Street to Main Street. Several buildings along Main Street, including the county courthouse and the historic railroad depot, utilized several sandbags around the buildings in an attempt to keep the rising flood waters at bay. Buildings as far west as Fourth Street (four blocks west of, and parallel to, the riverfront), and the historic fire station, were pumping out their basements due to the flood waters. On the morning of June 10, all rail traffic was halted at the BNSF Bridge and rerouted to other, safer bridges, as the level of the river was just a little over five feet from the bottom of the tracks, and flood waters had begun to overtake the bridge's western approach into Iowa, by the morning of June 15, the river had placed itself to the bottom of the bridge, hiding all piers, and causing the bridge to appear as if it were simply resting on top of the water. The city's rail yard, which runs parallel to the riverfront, began to experience flooding for the first time since the Flood of 1993 on the afternoon of June 12, as it encroached on their diversion spurs, and began to follow the tracks leading out of the city. By mid-afternoon on June 15, the entire yard had flooded out, by the morning of June 16, the flood waters were so deep in the rail yard, the tracks were no longer visible. Several buildings along the waterfront, including Memorial Auditorium, and the historic Port of Burlington building, began sandbagging efforts early on the morning of June 11 to keep out the rising flood waters. By the morning of June 12 the flood waters began to fill the parking lots of businesses along the riverfront, including the Port of Burlington and Memorial Auditorium, both of which sit at the river's edge, by the morning of June 16, both buildings had flooded up to the main floor, as the flood waters seeped through cracks between the sandbags, rendering the work that had been done to protect them useless, the outdoor stage that is connected to the south facade of the Port of Burlington building was not visible, nor were the access ramps that run along the entire western entrance. (the stage is built up five feet from ground level, and is made of concrete, the access ramps, and one raised sidewalk connects to it.) During the afternoon of June 14, the city, as well as Des Moines County evacuated all residents living east of County Highway 99 due to a levee in the area threatening to fail. A bulge had been seen on one side of the levee, and water was pooling near the base on the dry side, by the early morning of June 16, three more bulges were discovered along the Tama Levee, the longest levee in the area, and one of only a handful of survivors from the Flood of 1993, this made workers in the area state that it was no longer a question of if, but when the levee would break. One of the city's largest employers, Case Corporation, had been threatened with rising flood waters, due to its proximity to the riverfront, and due to the closeness to a levee that was severely damaged due to constant rains in the area, by the morning of June 15, Case had ceased all production, and ordered a shutdown of the plant, allowing workers to help in the sandbagging effort, surprisingly, the plant survived the flood unscathed, the fourth such flood it had withstood,(the building that houses the Case plant has stood in its current location since the late 1890s, first as Shower Brothers furniture. The plant, as Case, became operational in 1937, and withstood the floods of 1965, 1973, and 1993.) By the early evening of June 14 residents were put on alert that water might be shut off, due to the possibility of flood waters reaching the treatment plant along the riverfront, however, on the morning of June 15, it was stated that the plant would not be affected, unless the river were to crest at, or above the mark, which, according to records, has not happened in well over a century, and not since the recent water treatment plant had been built. Burlington's newspaper, The Hawk-Eye, remained in operation throughout the flood, despite its close proximity to the Mississippi River. It has never stopped publication in its history. One of two major highways that serve the Burlington area, U.S. Highway 61, was closed off just south of the city, near the county line. On July 19, 2008, the Great River Bridge, connecting Highway 34 west with Illinois officially re-opened after being closed for nearly a month. The Great River bridge is an important connection to Illinois, because nearly 40% of Burlington's workforce lives in nearby Illinois, also, several Burlington residents work in cities in Illinois. The early morning of June 15 saw a section of Main Street, between Division Street, and Jefferson Street blocked off, due to the rising flood waters. The entire length of County Highway 99, from the city limits, to the northern county line, was blocked off, due to the rising flood waters, and a break along a levee on the Iowa River near Oakville (the road had already been blocked off near the northern county line, due to construction). The National Weather Service expects the river to crest on June 18 at , surpassing the crest of the Flood of 1993 by 0.7 feet, making it the second worst flood in the city's history. By the morning of June 15, several streets had been closed, making travel difficult, among them were, Front Street, running the entire length of the road, Main Street, between Division Street, and Jefferson Street, Mill Dam Road, Tama Road, and all of its side roads, U.S. Highway 61, and County Highway 99, by the morning of June 17, Main Street had been blocked off even further, extending another block to the south, and Division Street had been blocked off up to Third Street, along with Jefferson Street, and Valley Street. By June 15, Lock and Dam 18, north of the city, had stated that if the river does not begin to recede soon, they would be forced to open the flood gates, due to the possibility of the river topping over the dam. On the morning of June 15, the Stevenson Lake levee, near Gulfport, Illinois gave way, bringing the depth of the river down somewhat, but completely obliterating the small town of 200, which lay directly across the river in Illinois. As of July 23, 2008, the city of Gulfport, IL remains under water. Because Gulfport sits below the Mississippi river level, Gulfport will need to be drained using pumps. Many businesses and homes are steadily decaying or are already destroyed. As August drew to a close, Gulfport had been pumped out, the complete obliteration of several buildings, including The Beverage Mart was noticeable, these buildings would be demolished later on, as of September 23, no plans have been made on reconstruction. The town didn't see any help until the following summer, when several construction companies finally were allowed into the area, which had been blocked off by the Illinois State Police, and the Henderson County Sheriff's office. In September 2008, the area, once again, became the victim of massive flooding, as a spillway off the river, known as Flint Creek, as well as a small pool area, known as Dumbbell Lake, jumped their banks, after a week of hard rain, caused by the remnants of Hurricane Ike. Tama Road was severely damaged due to the raging flood waters, and was caught on both sides of the road. The flood was so severe, that the earthen embankments eroded, and the concrete road bed fractured, and crumbled, causing widespread damage over the two mile length of the road. As of December 2008, the road remains closed due to massive damage. In several areas along County Highway 99, the flood waters came against the high embankments, making the fields on the east side of the road appear to be nothing more than a large lake area for an estimated five miles, the flooding could also be seen along certain areas of U.S. Highway 61, at the north end of town. Although neither highway was flooded out, or closed, the damage was noticeable, especially where County Highway 99 was at its most vulnerable, two of the four piers constructed for a new bridge near the northern county line were knocked over by the water, and had to be rebuilt. As of December, 2009, Tama Road still remains unpaved, with gravel filling in the areas where the old concrete road bed had given out. In the areas where the road had been destroyed, a difference in road height of three feet, or more is instantly noticeable. Continuing arguments between the Burlington City Council, and the Des Moines County Board of Supervisors over responsibility of the road prevents any repairs from taking place (in the mid-1970s, the city had paved the road in concrete, taking responsibility from the county, the city's argument is that the road sits outside of the city limits, and therefore, the county is responsible). Finally, in early 2010, after a final winter thaw eroded the roadbed even further, completely destroying what was left of the road, the state stepped in, and took over the reconstruction, billing the city for their services. The road was opened later that same year, completely repaved, and set with a new waterproof concrete roadbed, and several new drainage culverts. Media response The local TV news stations went to wall- to-wall coverage starting Wednesday, June 11. KGAN-TV (CBS, channel 2) and KCRG-TV (ABC, channel 9), in Cedar Rapids, and KWWL-TV, (NBC, channel 7), in Waterloo all stayed on air giving local coverage, preempting network programs, even to include preempting the network evening news program. KCRG moved ABC's coverage of Game 4 of the 2008 NBA Finals to its digital subchannel, while KWWL broadcast NBC's coverage of the 2008 U.S. Open Golf Championship. Stations resumed airing regular programming June 15. Des Moines television stations aired all local coverage during the day on Friday, June 13. WHO-TV left briefly to allow NBC to announce the death of Tim Russert. After the Des Moines flood threat proved to be not as bad as once thought, stations returned to regular programming that evening. KCRG and The Gazette, both owned by Gazette Communications and located adjacent to each other in downtown Cedar Rapids, continued to operate out of their respective newsrooms despite the nearby flooding and loss of electricity. The Gazette's editor at the time, Steve Buttry, officially began his duties just two days before waters rose above flood stage in Cedar Rapids. At about 9:30 p.m. on Monday, June 16, KWWL went off the air due to a small electrical fire in the studio. An electrical motor in the ventilation system caught fire and sent smoke through the building.http://www.kwwl.com/Global/story.asp?S=8500816 \\"KWWL returns to the air after power outage and electrical fire\\" KWWL-TV, just before 8:00 p.m. Monday, June 16, 2008, retrieved June 17, 2008 There were no injuries and hardly any damage. They resumed broadcasts at about 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday, June 17. Public health Iowa counties presidentially declared as disasters designated to receive various types of assistance. Just after midnight, central time, June 13, Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids began evacuating its patients from the facility. It is understood they could not further function under the emergency circumstances. The evacuation was completed by about 8:20 a.m.\\"Mercy Evacuates Patients as Floodwaters Rise\\" KCRG-TV, June 13, 2008, retrieved June 13, 2008Carly Weber, \\"Mercy Medical Center completes seven hour mass evacuation\\", Gazette Online, retrieved June 13, 2008 =Public Health Hazards: Physical and Mental= The main public health hazard was the polluted water, mixed with the outflow of overwhelmed sanitary sewer systems, petroleum products and a variety of other toxic materials, to include asbestos. As the waters recede, tremendous amounts of potentially infectious debris added to the problem; this included uncollected garbage and dead animals. This issue was exacerbated by the onset of the hot and humid summer weather. Just making the affected areas sanitary again was a huge undertaking. The problem of mold propagating in flooded buildings was one of major concern.Cindy Hadish, \\"Mold a Concern in flooded buildings, Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 17, 2008, p.3B Contact with polluted water and flood soaked item can cause rashes, and if it comes in contact with a skin cut, a variety of infections. Public officials warned of a potential increase in waterborne diseases such as dysentery as well as an increased population of mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus.Cindy Hadish, \\"Health hazards abound\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 19, 2008, p.5B Free tetanus shots were being offered in many areas, including Cedar Rapids and Iowa City.Cindy Hadish, \\"Thousands of Eastern Iowans looking into getting tetanus shots\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 17, 2008, p.3B In addition to physical disease, residents were warned of potential mental health problems. Parents were told to expect developmental regressions in child survivors of the flood, especially those who lost their homes. Even in adults, the stress of applying for services and managing daily activities under catastrophic conditions was expected to exacerbate pre- existing anxiety, depression, or family conflict. The physical and emotional stress of cleaning out flooded homes was only part of the trouble, as parents needed to manage all of this while still caring for children who were home on summer vacation. All of this was compounded by the summer heat & humidity, mosquitos and biting gnats, and the sheer number of people facing the same circumstances. Longterm consequences were possible as well. \\"Once the original shock and dismay pass, the losses of such things as wedding photos or treasured family heirlooms can lead to depression and even post-traumatic stress disorder,\\" said one official.Cindy Hadish, \\"Flooding could create spate of mental health issues\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p.1D Some rural areas suffered from a lack of access to badly-needed public and social services, and agencies were overwhelmed with the increase of people needing assistance. Also, due to the large area of the Midwest affected by this event, some rivers and tributaries took an abnormally long time to recede, with some areas remaining flooded for up to four weeks. The increased amount of standing water and flood-affected ground caused a summer-long increased population of biting midge gnats (sand flies), fungus gnats, flies, and mosquitoes, with the above-mentioned public health concerns.http://www.gcdailyworld.com/story/1439263.html Recovery Comparison has been made to the Grand Forks, North Dakota, 1997 Red River flood, Hurricane Katrina, and the Great Flood of 1993 and the lesson to be learned is that full recovery will take at least ten years, and that the political and private establishments will have to put aside territorial one- ups-man-ship and co-operate in making some decisions that will be decidedly unpopular.Steve Buttry, \\"N.D. found recovery took 10 years\\", Cedar Rapids Gazette, June 20, 2008, p.3A To assist in recovery efforts, a web site has been site up. Save Iowa was established to help flood victims as there is a tremendous need for donations all across Iowa. Save Iowa makes it easy for people around the country to donate to the flood relief cause of their choice. In response to the Iowa flood of 2008, the Iowa Legislature established the Iowa Flood Center as a part of the University of Iowa in 2009https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/ico/section/466C.1.pdf. FEMA trailers & formaldehyde A couple months after the June floods, Iowa flood victims reported violent coughing, headaches, and conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, and other health issues worsening since moving into the trailers. KGAN-TV out of Cedar Rapids tested 20 trailers in the Cedar Rapids area under contract with a nationally certified chemical testing company, with testing kits finding unsafe levels of formaldehyde in six of them, according to Environmental Protection Agency and American Lung Association limits, which are more stringent than FEMA's or Iowa's standards. After KGAN airing their results, intervention from Iowa Governor Chet Culver, and increasing concerns from residents, FEMA held a meeting in Cedar Rapids with residents, despite denying to intervene with the reports. FEMA will now retest trailers upon request, starting early November.

He was a Nationalist Party member of the Australian House of Representatives from 1917 to 1929. Lister was born in Lincolnshire in England and was educated there at Wesley School before migrating to Australia with his family in 1889, his family settling in Queensland, first in the Blackall Range and then in 1900 at Thornville. Lister himself then took up land at Wutul near Toowoomba. Lister enlisted in the military on 19 November 1914 and embarked for service in World War I with the 2nd Light Horse Field Ambulance. He served in the Gallipoli Campaign, in Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula and attained the rank of sergeant but fell ill with pneumonia and pleurisy in 1916 and was repatriated to Australia and discharged as medically unfit. He subsequently moved to Victoria, where his wife and son had moved during his war service, and became involved in recruitment efforts for the war. Lister had been a member of the Australian Labor Party, but being a supporter of conscription left the party in the 1916 Labor split, together with many other Labor members and MPs, and ended up in the new Nationalist Party of Australia. In 1917, he was elected as a Nationalist to the Australian House of Representatives as the member for Corio, defeating Labor MP Alfred Ozanne in a campaign centred on the interests of soldiers and his war service. He stated during the campaign that he would consider re-enlisting and resigning if his health improved sufficiently. He was the first returned serviceman from World War I to sit in parliament. He held the seat until his defeat in 1929. He attempted to win preselection to regain Corio in 1931, but was dropped in favour of Richard Casey; an attempt to recontest as an independent United Australia candidate was unsuccessful. In 1932, he moved back to his farm at Wutul in Queensland, but sold the farm and moved to live in Toowoomba in May 1934. He died at Toowoomba in 1935.

Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . Lee and his crew camped near Dawson Falls during the summers of 1913 and 1914 while they surveyed homesteaders' lots along the south side of the Murtle River. On July 24, 1913, Lee was surveying west from Dawson Falls when he discovered Helmcken Falls. Brink of Dawson Falls The Wells Gray Park road (Clearwater Valley Road) passes close to Dawson Falls. The main viewpoint is a 10-minute walk and it is another few minutes to the top of the waterfall. A rough trail on the north side of the Murtle River provides a different vantage point. Pyramid Campground, one of four campgrounds in Wells Gray Park, is just northeast of Dawson Falls and has 50 sites. At Dawson Falls, the Murtle River drops over lava flows that date to about 200,000 years ago. Below the lava are compacted sand and gravel deposits left by a river that predated the eruption. The Mushbowl is located downstream from Dawson Falls. The Murtle River drops here and is split by a central rock. The waterfall is located here because of Cambrian rock which has resisted erosion. The Wells Gray Park road bridges the Murtle River at The Mushbowl. The swirling water has eroded a small cave into the cliff on the south side of The Mushbowl and it can be entered at low water from July onwards. The Mushbowl's name was given to this waterfall prior to 1940 and it is a good description of the water's action. Until the late 1960s, a second name \\"Devil's Punchbowl\\" was sometimes heard, but was phased out because The Mushbowl is a unique name.

Battles's breakout role and career highlight came in 1944 as Gabey in the original Broadway production of the hit musical comedy On the Town. In 1947, he debuted as the lead (Joseph Taylor, Jr.) in Rodgers and Hammerstein's Allegro. He last starred in Thirteen Daughters in 1961.  Early theater experience  Battles, born Francis TuohyTuohy Family Sources in Manhattan and raised in Rutland, Vermont,Playbill, Allegro, October 10, 1947 had his early experience in theater with the Woodstock Players in Woodstock, Vermont, the Germantown Theatre Guild in Philadelphia,Playbill, On the Town, December 28, 1944 and the Irvine Studio for the Theatre in New York, before making his professional debut. His first role on Broadway was as a chorus member in Cole Porter's Something for the Boys, starring Ethel Merman.Playbill, On the Town, December 28, 1944. Playbill, Allegro, October 10, 1947. Battles converted his place in the chorus into a small featured part, the M.P., before moving on to Follow the Girls starring Jackie Gleason and featuring a young Danny Aiello as the Dancing Boy. Battles played the Yokel Sailor and understudied one of the male leads before resigning from the production when he was offered the role of Gabey in On the Town.  Broadway stardom  On the Town = On the Town opened on Broadway at the Adelphi Theater on Dec. 28th, 1944. It moved briefly to the 44th Street Theater on June 4, 1945 and finally to the Martin Beck Theater on July 30, 1945 before closing on Feb. 2nd, 1946 after a run of 462 performances.Internet Broadway Database entry for On the Town Battles stayed with the production for the entirety of the run,The New York Times, January 11, 1946. missing two periods due to illness and vacation break when understudy Marten Sameth stepped into his role.The New York Times, February 2, 1945. The New York Times, September 25, 1945 After closing on Broadway, On the Town opened (without Mr. Battles) as a touring production two days later in Baltimore on February 4 The New York Times, January 11, 1946 and in 1949 a film version of On the Town was produced by MGM with Gene Kelly starring in the role originated by Battles. MGM was a financial backer of On the Town and before its stage debut paid a $100,000 deposit towards securing the screen rights.The New York Times, December 28, 1944 In addition to giving Battles his career making role, On the Town was the first Broadway success for a quartet of American theater legends: composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein, choreographer Jerome Robbins, and actors and book and lyric writers Adolph Green and Betty Comden. New York reviews for the show were mixed, but mostly favorable. Lewis Nichols in The New York Times said it was \\"the freshest and most engaging musical to come this way since the golden day of Oklahoma!\\".The New York Times, December 29, 1944 Louis Kronenberger of the New York newspaper PM concurred by calling it \\"much the best musical of the year\\".New York newspaper PM, December 29, 1944 The show's detractors included John Chapman of the New York Daily News, who dismissed it as \\"a dullish musical comedy\\".New York Daily News, December 29, 1944 Occupying the middle ground between the extremes was Burton Rascoe of the New York World Telegram who offered merely that \\"if you are not too exacting it is pretty good fun\\".New York World- Telegram, December 29, 1944 Battles's role as Gabey put him at the heart of the matter in On the Town as one of the trio of sailors the show follows over a 24-hour period of leave in New York City. As Gabey, Battles featured in the singing of six of the show's songs: \\"New York, New York\\", \\"Lonely Town\\", \\"Lucky to be Me\\", \\"Subway Ride\\", \\"Imaginary Coney Island\\", and the show ending reprise of \\"New York, New York\\". Mentions of Battles in the reviews, as for cast members generally, were brief but approving. From Howard Barnes of the New York Herald Tribune: \\"Battles comes through with 'Lonely Town' and 'Lucky To Be Me'.\\" New York Herald Tribune, December 29, 1944. From Wilella Waldorf of the New York Post: \\"John Battles as the lovelorn gob is an engaging youth\\".New York Post, December 29, 1944 Robert Garland of the New York Journal American, while ruefully less than enthused about the show, echoed Barnes of the Herald Tribune and included Battles's singing on \\"Lonely Town\\" and \\"Lucky To Be Me\\" among features to recommend the show.New York Journal American, December 29, 1944 = Allegro = If On the Town heralded the arrival of new legends on Broadway, Battles' next role, the male lead in the new musical Allegro from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, was an engagement with legends already well established. Rodgers and Hammerstein had already between them nearly six glory-filled decades of Broadway triumph and in their first collaboration, Oklahoma!, created an enormous hit (even at that moment in the midst of a stunning performance run of 2,212 shows)Internet Broadway Database entry for Oklahoma! that was to become a staple of the American musical theater stage. Rodgers and Hammerstein's producing partners for Allegro, Lawrence Langer and Theresa Helburn of the Theatre Guild, were equally distinguished. The Guild's producing credits stretched back to 1919 and included original Broadway productions of works by Eugene O'Neill, Ferenc Moln√°r, George Bernard Shaw, and George Gershwin. Langer and Helburn's previous collaborations with Rodgers and Hammerstein were several and included Oklahoma! and the now revered Carousel.Internet Broadway Database entry for The Theatre Guild The debut of Allegro was avidly awaited. Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post called it \\"the most strenuously anticipated musical show of the post-war era\\"New York Post, October 11, 1947 and advance ticket sales for Allegro were reported as unprecedented by longtime New York Times theater reporter Sam Zolotow.The New York Times, October 10, 1947 Battles's role as Allegro's protagonist Joseph Taylor, Jr. was apparently among the first to be cast. On July 4, 1947 Zolotow reported in the Times that as of that date \\"only John Battles and John Conte are definite for the cast\\".The New York Times, July 4, 1947 As such, Battles joined yet another American theater luminary already attached to the project. Agnes de Mille, niece of Hollywood film producing and directing titan Cecil B. DeMille, was on board as director in addition to her accustomed role as choreographer. Agnes de Mille had previously choreographed the original Broadway productions of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Oklahoma! and Carousel and was fresh off her Tony winning success with Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's Brigadoon.Internet Broadway Database entry for Agnes de Mille Allegro opened on Broadway at the Majestic Theatre on October 10, 1947. It ran until July 10, 1948 for a total of 315 performances. Battles performed in his role for the entirety of the run.Internet Broadway Database entry for Allegro Allegro centers on the first 35 years of the unremarkable life and times of Joseph Taylor, Jr., the character played by Battles. Several critics likened the unpretentious tale of this musical play to Thornton Wilder's iconic drama of everyday small-town American life Our Town. New York reviews for Allegro were largely favorable and those nearly reverent. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it \\"a work of great beauty and purity\\" and stated that Rodgers and Hammerstein had only \\"just missed the final splendor of a perfect work of art\\".The New York Times, October 11, 1947 Ward Morehouse, writing in The Sun, called it a \\"musical play of beauty and dignity\\" and ranked it alongside Rodgers and Hammerstein's masterworks Oklahoma! and Carousel as \\"a theatrical piece of taste, imagination, and showmanship\\".The Sun, October 11, 1947 Not to be outdone, Robert Coleman in the Daily Mirror called it perfection.Daily Mirror, October 11, 1947 The few negative reviews for Allegro expressed a profoundly different view. Louis Kronenberger, in the New York newspaper PM, called it a grave disappointment that could be called an out-and-out failure and stated that the strange thing about Allegro was \\"not that it's bad but that it's boring\\".New York newspaper PM, October 13, 1947 William Hawkins in the New York World Telegram echoed such sentiments, calling Allegro a vast disappointment.New York World-Telegram, October 11, 1947 The New York critics' reaction to Battles's performance in Allegro was generally positive. Howard Barnes in the New York Herald Tribune opined that \\"John Battles is perfect as the hero\\".New York Herald Tribune, October 11, 1947 Ward Morehouse in The Sun called Battles \\"an affecting Joe Taylor - forthright, bewildered, and believable\\". Even the New York newspaper PM's severely disappointed Louis Kronenberger allowed that Battles was a likable Joe Taylor. It was only William Hawkins in the New York World Telegram who sounded a sour note in calling the cast (with two noted exceptions, not including Battles) simply colorless.  Engagements abroad  The end of the nine-month run of Allegro marked a five-year-long period of heavy activity on Broadway for Battles and at this point he took a break from performing on its stages to pursue acting opportunities abroad. Battles turned down several Broadway offers in 1948 and accepted instead a contract for the 1948 season from the Gate Theatre of Dublin, Ireland.The New York Times, August 24, 1948 The Gate Theatre was formed in Dublin in 1928 by the Irish actors and theatrical producing team of Hilton Edwards and Michael MacLiammoir, also a playwright. The Gate gave Orson Welles and James Mason their professional acting debuts in 1931 and 1935, respectively.The Gate Theatre web site, August 2009 Before his departure for Ireland, Battles spoke with Louis Calta of The New York Times. Battles called the Gate one of the finest repertory companies in the world and expressed his regard for Edwards and MacLiammoir as great teachers. = Abdication = Battles' first performance with the Gate came in H.T. Lowe-Porter's Abdication, which opened at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin on September 27, 1948.irishplayography.com entry for Abdication His role as the Second Duke was minor and he is little mentioned in reviews. Gate founders Edwards and MacLiammoir both took parts, the latter the lead role of the Prince, with Edwards wearing also the hat of director. Abdication debuted to much anticipation. It was a world premiere by a non-Irish playwright, at the time something of a novelty in Ireland, and the play was perceived to portray the unprecedented abdication in 1936 of England's King Edward VIII, this still quite fresh in people's minds. Lowe-Porter, known widely then as the authorized English translator for famed German writer Thomas Mann, was quoted at the time saying that \\"the parallel between this chronicle play and the facts of Edward VIII's abdication are incidental\\".Irish Times, September 28, 1948 Others saw it quite differently. A reporter for the Manchester Daily Mail said \\"only the flimsiest of veils separates the stage show from the historic events in England in 1936\\".Manchester Daily Mail, September 28, 1948 The Cork Examiner called the play's Elizabethan-era setting a slight disguise which at times wears off altogether.The Cork Examiner, September 28, 1948 It is worth noting that Porter-Lowe was reported at the time as being a close friend of the Duchess of Windsor - the former Wallis Simpson and the very woman at the center of King Edward's abdication.Dublin Evening Herald, September 25, 1948 Abdication proved popular with both critics and ticket buyers. The Manchester Daily Mail called it a brilliant verse play and noted that the audience cheered and wildly applauded. The Cork Examiner also noted an enthusiastic reception from the audience and deemed the show a spectacular production. The Sunday Independent called it a skillfully staged and produced drama.Sunday Independent, October 3, 1948 Such success was enough for the Gate to hold Abdication over for additional performances. Significantly, this left time enough only for a two show season whereas three shows had initially been planned for the six-week season of Autumn 1948. = The Mountains Look Different = This second show, The Mountains Look Different, received its world premiere at the Gaiety on October 25, 1948 and ran for the two-week remainder of the Gate's six-week home season in Dublin. Immediately following, Battles and company moved to the Citizens Theatre of Glasgow, where the Gate began a four-week Scottish season. Like its predecessor, some controversy greeted this new play from Gate co-founder MacLiammor. The Mountains Look Different centers on a young Irish woman, played in this production by British stage and screen veteran Sheila Burrell, trying to leave behind a past that includes a turn as a prostitute in London. Upon return to her native west of Ireland with her husband-to-be, she meets up with her past in the form of her fianc√©'s father, a former customer. These circumstances and themes as MacLiammoir related to them engendered hostile reactions from critics and audiences in both Ireland and Scotland. Several in-theater disruptions of the show were reported, letters to the editor in newspapers voiced indignant disgust, and professional reviewers variously dismissed the play as \\"a sordid and unpleasant piece\\",Glasgow Herald, November 10, 1948 and effort expended \\"on a subject that proves nothing, teaches nothing and is scarcely palatable entertainment\\".Glasgow Evening Times, November 10, 1948 On balance, however, reaction to the play in both venues was mixed. The Evening Mail critic called it a powerful play that \\"put a spell on the audience\\"Evening Mail, October 26, 1948 and Gabriel Fallon writing in The Standard called it MacLiammoir's greatest play and \\"a work within a stone's throw of great tragedy\\".The Standard, November 5, 1948 Critical reactions to the actors' performances were generally positive, even where the play itself was dismissed or castigated. \\"Those Irish can act\\" ran the headline in the Scottish Daily Express.Scottish Daily Express, November 5, 1948 \\"First-Rate Acting\\" echoed the headline in The Bulletin.The Bulletin, November 10, 1948 Battles shared in the critical plaudits. The Standard's Fallon noted his performance as outstanding; the Evening Herald critic lauded him for compelling playing;Evening Herald, October 26, 1948 the Irish Times writer chimed in, stating that \\"John Battles produced some impressively tragic miming\\".Irish Times, November 26, 1948 The Times Pictorial also weighed in positively, if ambivalently, for Battles stating that while \\"John Battles miming as the sinister fool is good ... the part seems to have included only for effect\\".The Times Pictorial, October 27, 1948 = Belinda Fair = Springtime of 1949 found Battles engaged in London as the male lead in the new musical romance Belinda Fair. Produced at the Saville Theatre and written by Eric Maschwitz and Gilbert Lennox with music by Jack Strachey, it opened on March 25, 1949. It transferred to the Strand Theatre on June 20 and closed July 16 after 131 performances.http://www.guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_b/belinda_fair.htm Belinda Fair received a tepid critical response. The Sunday Times critic assessed the show as \\"equally compounded of period dresses, romantic cliches, and vulgarity\\", while suggesting that it would be immensely popular.The Sunday Times, April 3, 1949 Anthony Cookman in The Tattler confessed to a mild beguilement but wrote that the show's humor was \\"a dead horse flogged without mercy\\".The Tattler, April 13, 1949 The Times ventured somewhat more positively that \\"While nobody would call it an original musical comedy the scenes all have the familiar freshness that springs from an uncondescending invention\\".The Times, March 25, 1949 Battles's own notices as romantic lead Colonel Miles O'Malley in the production were similarly ambivalent. He was noted as handsome,Daily Mail, March 25, 1949 playing up gallantly, and acting and singing sympathetically. = The Rank Organization = In reporting on Mr. Battles 1948 departure from the U.S. for European stages, Louis Calta of The New York Times noted that while in Europe Battles would do a film for the Rank Organization. Rank, founded in 1937 by English industrialist J. Arthur Rank, was by 1948 a major player in British cinema, owning five film production studios and hundreds of cinema houses, and employing directing talents such as Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, and David Lean. Several of Rank's films from the 1940s, including The Red Shoes, A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus, and The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, are regarded as classics of British cinema. Yet, 1949 proved a difficult year for the Rank Organization and it was forced that year to sell off two of its five studios. It is perhaps owing to the timing of this tumult that no Rank film with John Battles appears to have ever been made.  Late career  Professional activity for Battles slowed considerably after that. He made his next and last appearance on Broadway in March 1961, this nearly 13 years after the close of Allegro. This for the short-lived 13 Daughters (28 performances), starring Don Ameche, with Battles in the supporting role of William.Internet Broadway Database entry for John Battles This role featured no solo turns at song and Battles is not mentioned in the show's New York Times review. 13 Daughters is remarkable as concerns Battles only as a return to Broadway, however brief, and for the mention in his show program biography of his playing in a touring production of Auntie Mame at some point after his return from Europe and his casting in 13 Daughters. Battles is credited there for the role of Brian O'Bannion alongside Shirl Conway in the title role.Playbill, 13 Daughters, March 2, 1961 Lastly, it was the death of Oscar Hammerstein that brought Battles briefly back into the Broadway limelight. He featured among a cast of several stage luminaries assembled to give tribute in song to Hammerstein at the 46th Street Theater on April 8, 1962. Others included Mary Martin, Helen Hayes, Alfred Drake, John Raitt, Elaine Stritch, and Hammerstein's composing partner Richard Rodgers.The New York Times, April 9, 1962  Personal life  Battles married Jane Anderson. On January 29, 1948, The New York Times ran a short item announcing the wedding for the upcoming February 14. Information accompanying a publicity photo of the couple on their wedding day released by a unit of the King Features Syndicate on April 14, 1949 states that the wedding took place the day before, April 13, 1949, at Hampstead Town Hall, in London where Battles was then starring in the musical \\"Belinda Fair.\\" King Features Syndicate Miss Anderson's profession was stated as short story writer in the immediately aforementioned New York Times article.The New York Times, January 29, 1948 Miss Anderson was elsewhere noted as a former model and the daughter of evangelist and author George Wood Anderson.The Post Journal, Jamestown, New York, September 27, 2009 At the time of his death in Fredericksburg, Texas, Battles was survived by daughter Catherine Erhard, four grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.

Some commentators describe the first movement of the sonata as by far the most interesting, as it shows Schubert breaking away from the restrictions on harmonic progressions his teacher Antonio Salieri had imposed for vocal music,Litschauer 2000 and as one of his happiest inspirations, prefiguring his later trade marks, while the remaining two movements are described as somewhat run of the mill.David Doughty in sleeve notes of Brilliant Classics 99678/9 Others see in the first movement rather unconvincing unorthodoxies lacking invention, while the other two movements are more musically satisfying, with reminiscences of Beethoven and some of Schubert's later compositions.Newbould 1999 ;I. Allegro ma non troppo : E major. :The first movement serves as a bright, apt opener to the sonata, introducing both the nature and key of the piece in an imaginative and exciting way. It was composed from 18‚Äì21 February 1815.Arrebola 2012 :The theme of the first movement is not especially melodic. Rather, it sets out to explore the key of E major using two types of contrast: chords vs. arpeggios and scales, and legato vs. staccato. After the opening E major chord, there is an ascending, legato arpeggio, which is met by a fast, downward scale, marked staccato. This pattern is repeated in the dominant, submediant, and finally the subdominant chords. All this together makes up the main tune. :The secondary themes all have basically the same elements: the left hand playing legato arpeggiations of chords, while the right hand plays staccato chordal melodies, interspersed with multiple grace notes. :The movement includes the conventional repeat of its exposition section, comprising three out of the total of 8 pages in the movement. There are also a few very long rests in the movement, a couple of which last up to two full measures. Such rests would reappear in his later work, like his last sonatas. ;II. Andante : E minor. :The movement is in rondo form, with two episodes. The theme is essentially harmonic. The second occurrence of the theme is, somewhat unusually, simplified instead of embellished, and in this form is quite similar to the opening of Schubert's unfinished seventh symphony in E major. The movement is in siciliana rhythm. ;III. Menuetto, Allegro vivace - Trio : A scherzo in B major, with trio in G major. The trio has some similarities to that of Schubert's later D major piano sonata, D 850: both trios move in almost constant crotchets and have the same key, sometimes even sharing harmonic progressions. Missing fourth movement? Although all three movements of sonata are complete in Schubert's autograph, the sonata as a whole is believed to be incomplete due to a missing final fourth movement.Badura-Skoda 1997, p 242 There is no indication Schubert ever attempted to start composing a fourth movement.Deutsch 1978, p 114 There are however indications that the work is to be regarded as incomplete without such additional movement: * A relatively weak indication is that the last movement is a Minuet and Trio, which was at the time an unusual type of movement to end a sonata with, although not unheard of (one example is Joseph Haydn's C-sharp minor sonata, Hob:XVI/36). This is the last of three movements, and it would have been a little more usual at the time to write a sonata in four movements, although three-movement sonatas are not too uncommon at this time. * A more compelling indication of the sonata's incomplete status is the fact that this Minuet and Trio is in the key of B major, not the sonata's tonic key of E major. It would have been extremely unusual at the time to end a sonata in a key other than its tonic, and it is much more likely that Schubert intended to add a fourth movement in the key of E major. However, there are other early instrumental compositions by Schubert that are certainly finished, and do not return to the tonic, for example the string quartet (two more early string quartets in mixed keys, D 19 and 19A, have been lost).Otto Erich Deutsch, The Schubert Thematic Catalogue. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. ‚Äì , p. 9 Others point to the finale-like character of the third movement, so that it can be seen as an effective conclusion of the sonata despite a failure to return to the tonic. It is not known whether Schubert never got around to composing a fourth movement or deliberately abandoned any attempt to write it. It is nevertheless unlikely that Schubert wrote a fourth movement that has since been lost, because several blank pages follow the third movement in the autograph. D 154, an unfinished sonata movement , an unfinished Allegro in E major, composed 11 February 1815, and like titled \\"Sonate\\" in the autograph, is usually seen as an early version of the first movement of .Deutsch 1978, pp 112-113 breaks off at the end of the development.Arrebola 2012, p. 4 Its second theme, several figures and the start of the development section are nearly identical to 's first movement. Others see and the first movement of as individual drafts of separate compositions merely sharing some of the material. D 154 is more demanding from a performer than the first movement of D 157, and is also written more orchestrally and adventurously. Score There were no publications of this work before the Breitkopf & H√§rtel complete edition of the end of the 19th century, known as the Alte Gesammtausgabe (AGA). =Manuscripts= The autograph of is titled Sonate and has 11 February 1815 as date at the end of the single and incomplete Allegro movement.

Together with Labor member for Oxley Francis Baker, he was the first member of the House born after Federation. He travelled widely overseas and in parliament was considered knowledgeable about international affairs; he was also a prominent voice within his party on primary producers' issues. Hutchinson held Indi until 1937, when he successfully contested the new seat of Deakin, which had consumed the southern end of the old Indi seat in an electoral redistribution. He attempted to list for World War II service in 1940, but was rejected on account of defective eyesight. In 1944, the United Australia Party became the Liberal Party of Australia, which Hutchinson duly joined. He held Deakin until 1949, when he retired to become a grazier. He died in 1967.

Egyptian-Canadians are mainly either Christians or Muslims. Most Christians are Coptic Orthodox with small numbers of Coptic Catholic and Coptic Protestant. Muslims are mostly Sunni. During the 1960s, 75% of Egyptian immigrants settled in Montreal. By 1991, 49% of Egyptian Canadians were in Quebec, whereas 41% were living in Ontario. By 2011, 54% of Egyptian Canadians were living in Ontario and 31% in Quebec. Most Egyptian Canadians are concentrated in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Religion Throughout the 1970s, immigrants from Egypt to Canada consisted of both Christians and Muslims, who mostly left due to poverty in their home country. Starting in 1985, the Canadian government encouraged investors to immigrate, which attracted wealthy Egyptians; these are described as \\"more conservative and less exposed to European influences than previous arrivals‚Äù. A 1989 survey of Egyptian Canadians in Quebec found that 35% were Copts, 20% Catholics, and 19% Muslims, while 13% followed other faiths and 12% did not indicate any religion.

Though it was a box-office flop upon its initial release, many modern critics hail it as a masterpiece and brilliant indictment of contemporary attitudes towards mental illness and addiction. In 1963, Jean-Luc Godard named it one of the ten best American sound films ever made. Bigger Than Life was based on a 1955 article by medical writer Berton Rouech√© in The New Yorker, titled \\"Ten Feet Tall\\". Plot Schoolteacher and family man Ed Avery (James Mason), who has been suffering bouts of severe pain and even blackouts, is hospitalized with what is diagnosed as polyarteritis nodosa, a rare inflammation of the arteries. Told by doctors that he probably has only months to live, Ed agrees to an experimental treatment: doses of the hormone cortisone. Ed makes a remarkable recovery. He returns home to his wife, Lou (Barbara Rush), and their son, Richie (Christopher Olsen). He must keep taking cortisone tablets regularly to prevent a recurrence of his illness. But the \\"miracle\\" cure turns into a nightmare when Ed begins to misuse the tablets, causing him to experience wild mood swings and, ultimately, a psychotic episode which threatens the safety of his family.

Simon as Dr. Norton * Christopher Olsen as Richie Avery * Roland Winters as Dr. Ruric * Rusty Lane as Bob LaPorte * Rachel Stephens as Nurse * Kipp Hamilton as Pat Wade Reception Bigger Than Life was not a financial success. Mason, who produced the film as well as starring in it, blamed its failure on its use of the relatively new widescreen CinemaScope format. American critics panned the film, considering it melodramatic and heavyhanded. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times called it tedious, \\"dismal\\", and \\"more pitiful than terrifying to watch\\". However, the film was well received by the influential magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma. Jean-Luc Godard called it one of the ten best American sound films. Likewise, Fran√ßois Truffaut praised the film, noting the \\"intelligent, subtle\\" script, the \\"extraordinary precision\\" of Mason's performance, and the beauty of the film's CinemaScope photography. Modern critics have praised Nicholas Ray's use of widescreen cinematography to depict the interior spaces of a family drama, rather than the open vistas typically associated with the format, as well as his use of extreme close-ups in portraying the main character's psychosis and megalomania. The film is recognized for its multi-layered examination of the American nuclear family in the Eisenhower era. While the film can be read as a straightforward expos√© on medical malpractice and the overuse of prescription drugs in modern American society,. Truffaut noted Nicholas Ray's low opinion of the medical profession, and of so-called \\"miracle drugs\\". His discussion of Bigger Than Life points out the visual similarity between the doctors in the film and \\"gangsters in crime films\\". it has also been seen as a critique of consumerism, the male- dominated traditional family structure, and the claustrophobic conformism of suburban life. Truffaut saw Ed's drug-influenced speech to the parents of the parent-teacher association as having fascist overtones. The film has also been interpreted as an examination of masculinity and a leftist critique of the low salaries of public school teachers in the United States. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100.

After the beginning of the First World War, Vaderland was re-registered in Liverpool and converted to a troopship, ferrying troops of the Canadian Expeditionary Force from Halifax to Liverpool. While under the operation of White Star‚ÄìDominion in 1915, she was renamed Southland to avoid the German-sounding Vaderland. In September 1915, Southland was torpedoed in the Aegean Sea by German submarine with the loss of 40 men. The ship was beached, repaired, and returned to service in August 1916. While in service between the United Kingdom and Canada on 4 June 1917, Southland was torpedoed a second time, this time by ; she was sunk off the coast of Ireland with the loss of four lives.

Two ships, Vaderland and at John Brown & Company of Clydebank in Scotland, and two others, and , were to be built at William Cramp & Sons in Philadelphia.Bonsor, p. 840. Owned by American Line and managed by International Navigation Co. Ltd.

Launched on 12 July 1900, Vaderland began her maiden voyage on 8 December 1900 when she left Antwerp for Southampton and New York City. She was chartered to the American Line and made three -Southampton ‚Äì Cherbourg ‚Äì New York round-trip voyages between 11 December 1901 and 8 April 1902. On 16 May 1903 she commenced Antwerp ‚Äì New York service under the Belgian flag, starting her last on 25 December 1914. During this service, she collided with the 43-gross ton American schooner John A. Allen off Georges Bank between the North Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Maine on 22 July 1906; John A.

He represented the Liberal Party in the House of Representatives from 1990 to 1993, representing the Victorian seat of Dunkley. In 1996 he was convicted of fraud relating to the liquidation of his engineering firm. Early life Ford was born in Adelaide on 10 August 1936. He was the managing director of a rollover protection structure (ROPS) engineering firm, Safety ROPS (Aust) Pty Ltd. He served on the Victorian council of the Australian Small Business Association, including as state president for a period. Politics Ford was elected to parliament at the 1990 federal election, defeating the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) member Bob Chynoweth in the Division of Dunkley. He was identified as a member of the \\"New Right\\" faction and had earlier stood for Liberal preselection in the Division of Goldstein against the incumbent MP Ian Macphee. In parliament, Ford served on the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. His predecessor Bob Chynoweth reclaimed Dunkley for the ALP at the 1993 election. ASC conflict and fraud conviction In November 1993, Ford was charged by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) with 29 counts of false accounting, three counts of \\"failing to act honestly as a director\\", one count of \\"transferring company property with intent to defraud\\", and one count of \\"making a material omission in a report\\". The charges related to allegations that he had engaged in bottom of the harbour tax avoidance by liquidating Safety ROPS (Aust) Pty Ltd and transferring its assets to Roll- Over Protection (Aust) Pty Ltd. He was convicted of fraud in 1996. Ford had earlier come into conflict with the ASC during its investigation. In December 1992, he used parliamentary privilege to describe an ASC visit to his company's office as a \\"terrorist attack\\", also referring to an ASC senior investigator as a \\"jack-booted thug\\" and comparing the organisation to the Gestapo and KGB. He further alleged that the ASC had leaked details of his company finances to political opponents and The Age, and that the investigation into his company was a retaliation for his actions on a Senate committee into the ASC.

He grew up in Durham where he trained as a primary school teacher, before moving to Hull in 1938, and had studied French at university though spoke it less than perfectly. WWII He joined the Royal Corps of Signals in August 1940, before joining the Special Operations Executive‚Äôs French (or F) Section in July 1941. =First mission= Monument commemorating the landing of Capt. Peter Churchill from HMS Unbroken at Cap d'Antibes on 21 April 1942 In Operation DELAY II Peter Churchill‚Äôs mission was to land four SOE agents on the French Riviera by submarine. On 26 February 1942 Churchill flew from Bristol to Gibraltar with two radio operators, Isidore Newman ¬´Julien¬ª for the URCHIN network and Edward Zeff ¬´Matthieu¬ª for the SPRUCE network, where they were joined by Marcel Clech ¬´Bastien¬ª, radio operator for the AUTOGIRO network, and Victor Gerson ¬´Ren√©¬ª, an SOE agent on a special mission to organise the VIC Escape Line.Nigel PerrinDuel of Wits, Peter Churchill, Hodder and Stoughton, 1953 They travelled in HM Submarine P 42 ‚ÄúUnbroken‚Äù to Antibes where on the night of 21 April 1942 Churchill took Newman and Zeff and their radios to the shore by canoe, and led them to their contact Dr √âlie L√©vy. Churchill then returned to the submarine and dropped off Clech and Gerson by canoe at Pointe d‚ÄôAgay near Fr√©jus before returning to the UK. In May Newman joined the URCHIN network of Francis Basin \\"Olive\\" on the C√¥te d'Azur and established radio links with London, sending around 200 messages before Basin was arrested in Cannes on 18 August. Peter Churchill returned to Cannes on 27 August to organise and coordinate the SOE F Section SPINDLE Network which directed the delivery of supplies to support the CARTE Organisation run by Andr√© Girard and Newman joined SPINDLE as Network Manager. A quarrel arose between Newman and Girard because of the excessive length of the messages that Girard imposed on him, in contradiction with the rules of security. Considering it vital to remain on good terms with Girard, Churchill sent Newman back to London in early November.On the night of 3/4 November a Seadog commanded by Buchowski landed 9 people and 500 kg of materials, and embarked 6 people in Port-Miou,. Those landed were: George Starr, Marcus Bloom, Mary Herbert, Marie-Therese Le Chene, Odette Sansom, Gracomino Galea, and three others. Those who embarked were: Isidore Newman, John Starr, Jean Nohain-Jaboune \\"Quintet\\" (Radio-Patrie), X \\"Richard\\" and his son, and another.

During this mission Newman sent 54 messages. SALESMAN needed a reliable radio link with London to begin coordinating supply drops and made effective use of the arms it then received, sinking an 800-ton minesweeper in September, and wrecking a local power station the following month. Newman maintained tight security, transmitting from three separate locations and never transmitting more than twice from the same location before moving to the next, but German direction-finding teams were close to arresting him and he was forced to cease transmission for six weeks at one point. On 8 March1944 Claude Malraux, who was temporarily in charge of SALESMAN, was arrested and within hours all his contacts were blown. =Arrest and death= Newman was arrested on 31 March 1944 and was subsequently suspected of revealing the locations of his safe houses. He was taken to the Gestapo prison in Paris, then Fresnes prison, and lastly transferred to Mauthausen concentration camp where he was executed on 7 September 1944.

Opened in 2011, the stadium serves as a replacement for historic Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium. TD Ameritrade Park has a seating capacity of 24,000, with the ability to expand to 35,000 spectators. The ballpark was expected to cost $128 million to construct and is located near the CHI Health Center Omaha. The park turned a profit of $5.6 million in its first year of operation, easily covering its debt payments. It is the home field of the Creighton University Bluejays baseball team, and the host venue of the College World Series‚Äîthe final rounds of the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship. The College World Series has been held in Omaha since 1950, and will continue to be hosted there through at least 2035. The Big Ten Conference has also held its baseball tournament at TD Ameritrade Park, first in 2014 and 2016, and from 2018 through 2022. Attempts were made to bring a professional baseball team to TD Ameritrade Park, but legal troubles prevented this. The local Pacific Coast League franchise, the Omaha Storm Chasers (formerly Royals), opted for a smaller capacity venue at the new Werner Park, west of Papillion.  History  left Groundbreaking for TD Ameritrade Park occurred January 21, 2009. It was announced on June 8, 2009 that TD Ameritrade, a company based in Omaha, will carry the naming rights for the new stadium. The official announcement came from TD Ameritrade's Chief Executive Officer Fred Tomczyk on June 10, 2009. On April 15, 2010, it was announced that the Omaha Nighthawks, the local franchise in the United Football League, would play their first season in Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium and then move to TD Ameritrade for 2011 and beyond. The football gridiron was laid along a line extending from home plate down the first base line into right field. The United Football League suspended all play midway though its 2012 season and then dissolved afterwards, marking the end of professional football at TD Ameritrade Park. In December 2010, it was announced that Omaha would host a six-day multi-genre music festival in July called Red Sky Music Festival. Concerts were to be held all day in the parking lots of CenturyLink Center and TD Ameritrade Park. Each night there was to be a main concert held inside TD Ameritrade Park and CenturyLink Center. The festival lasted just two years, 2011 and 2012. The original Hammond organ from Rosenblatt Stadium has been restored and is used during games at TD Ameritrade, although musician Lambert Bartak (retired after the 2010 CWS, died in 2013) would not be the organist. On February 9, 2013, the ballpark hosted outdoor ice hockey at the \\"Mutual of Omaha Battles on Ice.\\" The first game featured the junior Omaha Lancers and the Lincoln Stars of the USHL. The second game was a collegiate matchup between the Nebraska‚ÄìOmaha Mavericks and the University of North Dakota of the WCHA. In May 2014, it was announced that a franchise in the new Fall Experimental Football League, called the Omaha Mammoths, would play their home games at TD Ameritrade Park beginning in October. The Mammoths would only play one shortened season in Omaha. In 2014 and 2016, TD Ameritrade Park hosted the Big Ten Conference's baseball championship. A four-year contract was soon reached to hold the tournament there from 2018 through 2022. On June 21, 2018, Major League Baseball announced that a regular season game between the Kansas City Royals and Detroit Tigers would be played at TD Ameritrade Park on June 13, 2019, ahead of the 2019 College World Series. The Royals won the game 7‚Äì3 with 25,454 people in attendance. = First game = MVC Tournament; May 2011 The first regular season college baseball game was played on April 19, 2011, between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and host Creighton Bluejays. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown out by TD Ameritrade CEO Fred Tomczyk. It was a game of many firsts for the park including first balk and first hamster races. The Cornhuskers won 2‚Äì1 in front of a paid attendance of just over 22,000 (a sellout) and a scanned attendance of just over 18,000, making it the most attended game of the collegiate regular season. During its first season, the Missouri Valley Conference baseball tournament was held at the ballpark in late May, the third time Creighton had hosted the event. = First College World Series = TD Ameritrade Park hosted its first College World Series in June 2011. Participants were South Carolina Gamecocks, Florida Gators, Vanderbilt Commodores, Virginia Cavaliers, North Carolina Tar Heels, California Golden Bears, Texas A&M; Aggies, and Texas Longhorns. Before the opening game of the CWS between Vanderbilt and North Carolina on Saturday, June 18, the ceremonial first pitch was delivered by former President George W. Bush. Omaha Little Leaguer Henry Slagle had the honor of handing the ball to President Bush as his Memorial Park Little League team greeted the former President on the field. Before the pitch, his father, former President George H. W. Bush, who played for Yale in the first CWS in 1947, delivered a video message christening the new facility. Omaha's own Geno Klobner sang the stadium's first CWS national anthem prior to the game. Attendance for the first game was set at 22,745, standing room only, fans. The first CWS pitch at the new park was thrown by UNC's Patrick Johnson to Vanderbilt's Tony Kemp at exactly 1:11 PM Central Daylight Time. Vanderbilt's Connor Harrell hit the first CWS home run in the park in the sixth inning of the game, a two-run blast over the left field wall, as the Commodores went on to beat North Carolina 7-3. The first CWS finals in the new ballpark began on Monday, June 27, at 7 PM between the South Carolina Gamecocks and their SEC Eastern Division Rivals, the Florida Gators, in front of 25,851 fans. Other worthy notes about the park's first CWS were the Southeastern Conference's Eastern Division South Carolina, Florida and Vanderbilt completing a podium clean sweep, and the 2011 CWS All-Tournament Team being comprised completely of players from the SEC East. This was also the first year in which the new BBCOR Composite baseball bat (Batted Ball Coefficient of Restitution) standard was ushered-in. Meant to reduce the speed of the ball off the bat while lessening the potential for injury to players, particularly pitchers. The new bat also proved to negate the long ball which has caused critics to claim that the new park is too large for the toned-down bats and makes the exciting home run ball a thing of the past in the CWS. Also, pitchers were held to a strict 25 second clock between pitches for the first time in the history of the College World Series. The pitch clock was instituted in an effort to shorten the games. In 2011, the average total session (game) time was 3:10 with the longest game at 4:25, the shortest at 2:38, the Championship game at 3:21 and only one of the 14 sessions took over four hours to complete.  Attendance  Entrance; May 2011 = College World Series = The 2011 CWS, the first played at TD Ameritrade Park, consisted of 14 sessions with a total attendance of 321,684 for an average session attendance of 22,977. The 2011 total was both the highest since 2005 and 2,294 spectators more than the 2010 per-game average of 20,683. The 2013 CWS, also consisted of 14 sessions with a total attendance of 341,483 for an average session attendance of 24,392 (both all-time highs for the CWS). TD Ameritrade Park is becoming well known for its lack of home runs leading to the idea that teams must play small ball to win. Nevertheless, KJ Harrison from Oregon State hit a grand slam‚Äîthe first ever in the ballpark during the College World Series‚Äîto deep left-center field in June 2017, during a 13‚Äì1 win over Louisiana State. The first grand slam in TD Ameritrade Park was hit by Creighton in a game against Utah Valley. = Creighton = In 2013, Creighton ranked tenth among Division I baseball programs in attendance, averaging 4,041 per game. = Omaha Nighthawks = The Omaha Nighthawks competed in TD Ameritrade Park in the former United Football League. The highest attendance for a Nighthawks game at TD Ameritrade Park was 17,697, for the October 15, 2011 game against the Las Vegas Locomotives. The lowest attendance, almost exactly a year later on October 17, 2012, was 2,234, with the Locomotives also the opponent. = Big Ten Conference Tournament = The first Big Ten Conference Baseball Tournament to be played at TD Ameritrade Park was held in 2014. The championship game of that tournament was attended by 19,965 spectators, which remains a record for single-day attendance at an NCAA conference tournament game. The Indiana Hoosiers defeated the Nebraska Cornhuskers, 8‚Äì4, to claim the Big Ten title. The tournament was once again hosted at TD Ameritrade Park in 2016. Beginning in 2018, the Big Ten Conference arranged for TD Ameritrade Park to host its tournament every season until 2022.

Maryland Dove is a re- creation/replica of Dove, an early 17th-century English trading ship, one of two ships which made up the first expedition from England to the Province of Maryland. The modern Dove was designed by the naval architect and naval historian William A. Baker. Maryland Dove Launched in 1978, Maryland Dove is 56 feet in length on deck, and 76 feet overall with a displacement of 42 tons. She was built by James B. Richardson in a shipyard near Cambridge, Maryland in Dorchester County. Her home port is St. Mary's City, Maryland. The ship is owned by the State of Maryland and operated/maintained by the Historic St. Mary's City Commission. She was commissioned October 8, 1978 with Captain Thomas Doyle of Valley Lee, Maryland as her first licensed Master. The original Ark and Dove The first expedition from England to the planned colony of Maryland was undertaken by Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, (1605-1675), and consisted of two ships that had formerly belonged to his father, George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, (1579-1632): Ark and Dove.Browne, Page 40 The two ships departed Gravesend, in Kent off the English Channel, with 128 settlers on board and, after being chased down and brought back by the British Royal Navy so that the departing settlers could take an oath of allegiance to the King of England as required by law, sailed in October 1633 for the Isle of Wight (between England and France) to pick up more settlers. At the Isle of Wight, Dove and her larger sister ship Ark embarked again with two Jesuit (Society of Jesus) priests/chaplains and nearly two hundred more settlers before setting out across the Atlantic.Browne, Page 45 Since he could not lead the expedition himself, Baltimore sent detailed instructions for the governance of the Colony, including commands that his brothers seek any information about those who had earlier tried to thwart the granting of the colony and make contact with William Claiborne (previously settled from Province of Virginia on Kent Island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay) to determine his intentions for the trading station on Kent Island.Browne, Pages 46-57 The instructions also emphasized the importance of religious toleration among the colonists, who were nearly equal parts Catholic and Protestant. With these last instructions, the expedition sailed for the Americas. Ark and Dove, 1934 Maryland Tercentenary United States postage stamp. The two ships arrived at Point Comfort at the mouths of the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers, in Virginia, February 24, 1634. On March 25, they landed at what is now St. Mary's, then the site of a Native American village, and they began the work of establishing a settlement there. The settlement of St. Mary's was built on land purchased from the native Yaocomico.Browne, Pages 59-62 Back in England, Baltimore could do little to help the young colony through its tribulations, which included an ongoing feud with Claiborne that led to a series of naval skirmishes.Browne, Pages 62-64 Lord Baltimore continued as Maryland's first Proprietary Governor (1632‚Äì1675), and attempted to maintain an active involvement in the governance of the colony, though he never visited it. During this long tenure, he governed through deputies, the last being his only son Charles.

He specialized in cross-dressing roles. He played numerous parts in television and movies, most known for his parts in Freebie and the Bean (1974) and General Hospital (1980). Early life Morley is the elder of two sons born to William Jarman Morley II and Audrey Mary Farmer. His paternal family originated in England, but came to America in 1843, settling first in Dillsboro, Indiana and later in Carrollton, Kentucky. His great-grandfather, William Jarman Morley, moved to Austin, Texas in the 1870s and was a co- founder of Morley Brother's Drug Company, with his brother, Stephen Kay Morley, of Morley Brothers Drug Company, which invented and patented many popular old remedies and gradually grew to include locations in several states. Christopher Morley's parents divorced and he and his brother were raised by their mother and allowed little contact with their father, a prominent veterinarian in El Paso, Texas. Education Morley was accepted to UCLA in 1969 with a major in mathematics. Once at UCLA, he changed his major to dance and studied ballet with Mia Slavenska. He also studied ballet with Stanley Holden at the Los Angeles Music Center. He performed with the Santa Monica Ballet at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in their production of The Nutcracker. Later he obtained a license in cosmetology, and worked in Beverly Hills in Vidal Sasoon's hair salon and in Jon Peters' hair salon, on Rodeo Drive. Career Morley specialized in cross-dressing roles in the 1970s and 1980s. He played numerous parts in television and movies, most known for his parts in Freebie and the Bean (1974) and General Hospital (1980). In General Hospital, Morley played Sally Armitage, owner of a bar and a friend of Laura. The role was played straight and attracted the flirtatious interest of Luke until Morley's character finally revealed he was a man. Once revealed as a male, Morley's character became part of a plot to hold Luke and Laura's lives as ransom, in exchange for hidden gold. After the gold was found, Morley's character was killed in a gunfight. On an episode of Magnum, P.I., he played David Bannister, a disgraced operative for the British MI6 intelligence service who was dismissed for being openly transvestite. Bannister becomes a deadly efficient ruthless international assassin available to the highest bidder, always operating in female guise, often as nuns in full habit (an advantageous disguise for various reasons). Morley was featured as a female impersonator in a pictorial article in the May 1975 issue of Playboy, photographed by Mario Casilli. In the 1980s and 1990s Morley was one of the foremost Marilyn Monroe impressionists, starring at the La Cage aux Folles Dinner Theatre in Los Angeles. Later he toured with their various road shows, An Evening At La Cage, playing Las Vegas, Toronto, Taipei, and Helsinki.

It is long from its source at Mahood Lake to its confluence with the Clearwater River, a tributary of the North Thompson River. The Mahood River has cut a deep canyon into Cambrian rocks and Pleistocene glacial moraines. The Mahood River drops over two waterfalls. Sylvia Falls is high and wide and cascades across a glacial moraine. The falls is noticeably eroding upstream and changing its appearance faster than other waterfalls in the park, since glacial deposits are fairly soft. Only downstream is Goodwin Falls which is high and wide.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. . Origin of names Nearby Mahood Lake and, later, the Mahood Falls community were named after James Adam Mahood who was in charge of a Canadian Pacific Railway survey in this area in 1872. The Mahood River and the Canim River, which feeds Mahood Lake from Canim Lake, were both originally named as part of Bridge Creek. They were renamed in 1941 and the name 'Bridge Creek' was retained only for the stream that flows into Canim Lake. Both Sylvia Falls and Goodwin Falls were named by photographer and author, Chess Lyons. In 1940, six months after Wells Gray Park was created, he was assigned by the B.C. Forest Service to explore and map the area. The Minister of Lands, Hon. Arthur Wellesley Gray, presented Lyons with a list of friends he wanted used in the naming of places in the park. Lyons thought this was inappropriate because he believed that place names should honor people who had been directly involved with the park such as pioneers, prospectors and trappers. However, orders had to be obeyed, so each time he passed a swamp, he dutifully assigned one of Gray‚Äôs names. However, each time he came upon a sizable creek, a waterfall or a peak he pulled his own carefully researched list from his backpack. Needless to say, Gray‚Äôs names have been lost to time, except for one - Goodwin Falls. Thirty years after his survey, Lyons commented to Helen and Philip Akrigg (British Columbia‚Äôs place name experts), \\"I had to hang a few names on, and Goodwin was some friend of Wells Gray. I think that was the most prominent thing named in the Park because I figured I would lead him astray with one thing while I named little insignificant things after the others that would all be forgotten. I have no idea who Goodwin was.\\" For many years, the origin of the Goodwin Falls name did remain a mystery and neither the B.C. Provincial Archives nor the Geographical Names Office could provide any clue about Goodwin. The puzzle was eventually solved by the Akriggs who learned from Gray‚Äôs niece that Walter Goodwin was a Spokane, Washington, dentist who had done some work on Gray's teeth the year before. By this chance association, he became memorialized in Wells Gray Park. The only other exception to Lyons' list of locals was Sylvia Falls which he named for his wife. Access A rough road from Clearwater on the Yellowhead Highway follows the west bank of the Clearwater River for and ends at the confluence of the Mahood River and Clearwater River. A primitive campsite is located here. A trail follows the south bank of the Mahood River upstream for to Sylvia and Goodwin Falls, about a one-hour walk. The trail, in poor condition, continues on to Mahood Lake, a hike of that takes about 1.5 hours. The only other access to Mahood River is by boat from Mahood Lake Campground at the west end.

In 2010, marking the Fair's 25th anniversary, the Mayor of Wellington City, Kerry Prendergast, awarded the Fair's founder, Des Smith, the very first Pink Wellington Award or 'Pinkie' for his role in starting this tradition. Out in the Square is a significant event in the life of the Gay & Lesbian community in Wellington, and some consider it to be one of the largest outdoor gay community events in Aotearoa New Zealand and one of the best events on Wellington's social calendar. Although the figures are disputed the event organizers claim that every year more than 8,000 people attend Out in the Square. Future In 2011, Out in the Square will be the first event in the programme of the 2nd Asia-Pacific Outgames - to be held in Wellington over 12‚Äì19 March 2011.

Located on Bound Brook Island on the west side of Wellfleet, Massachusetts, the centerpiece of the district is the Thomas Atwood House, built c. 1730. The property is emblematic of Cape Cod's colonial origins and its later transformation into a summer resort area. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976; the district was listed in 2010. The property is open for guided tours by the National Park Service on a seasonal basis. Description and history The Atwood‚ÄìHiggins property is located on the east side of Bound Brook Island, which is located in northwestern Wellfleet on the lower portion of Cape Cod. Set on are a collection of buildings, most of which were built George Higgins in the 20th century. The centerpiece of the property is a typical 1-1/2 story Cape house, whose oldest portion, a \\"half house\\" three bays wide, was built in 1730 by Thomas Higgins, a distant ancestor of George Higgins. This property was owned by Higgins descendants until 1805, when it was purchased by Thomas Atwood, Sr. The last full-time resident of the house was Atwood's son Thomas, Jr. who died in 1873. After sitting vacant for many years, the house was acquired in 1919 by George Higgins and the house was given a painstaking restoration. Higgins originally claimed the house to date to the 17th century; this is not supported by the architecture or documentary record. and George Higgins, in addition to restoring the house, built a variety of outbuildings, giving the property a rustic rural feel. The buildings he built include a barn, wellhouse, guest house, and country store, all essentially in a Colonial Revival interpretation of a colonial Cape Cod farmstead. This job was made easier when the town built an improved Bound Brook Island Road, connecting the island to the mainland. Higgins and his neighbors on the island made an agreement to limit development on the island to historically compatible alterations and improvements. Higgins gave the property to the National Park Service when the Cape Cod National Seashore was created in 1961. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 2010, the listing was greatly expanded to include the 20th-century buildings and to recognize the work of George Higgins. The house is seasonally open to tours offered by the Park Service.

The two-story Greek Revival building was built in 1831 to a design by architect Alexander Parris. It is built mostly out of Quincy granite, although its front portico and fluted Doric columns are made of wood fashioned to look like stone. The building has been expanded five times between 1879 and 1971, with each addition made in a style sensitive to its original styling, and its main courtroom features original Federal styling. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, and included in the Old King's Highway Historic District in 1987. The Barnstable Superior Court is located in the building. Description and history The courthouse is set on the south side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 6A, also known as the Old King's Highway), at the western edge of a complex housing administrative facilities of Barnstable County. The building consists of a north-facing original rectangular two-story block, behind which a series of symmetrically-arranged wings have been built. The original block, designed by the renowned architect Alexander Parris, measures , and is fashioned out of large blocks of Quincy granite. It is fronted by a Greek temple front, consisting of a triangular pediment supported by four fluted Doric columns. The temple front, including the columns, is fashioned out of wood finished to give the appearance of stone. The main courtroom has retained most of its original woodwork and trim, including some of its original furnishings. The building has been repeatedly enlarged to meet increased need for facilities. All of these expansions continued the use of Quincy granite, giving the building a unified feel. In 1879 the building was enlarged to the rear, and in 1889 a single-story ell was added extending east from the rear. In 1906 the eastern ell was raised to two stories and a matching two-story ell was added to the west. These ells were extended further to the southwest and southeast with two-story additions in 1925. The building underwent a major rehabilitation in 1971, at which time a small addition was added to south, centered between the last two additions.

After the Parry Auto Company passed into receivership in 1910, the Motor Car Manufacturing Company was created by its creditors. That particular name was chosen as they had not decided what to name their new automobile. Indeed the New Parry continued to be produced until a little after the new Pathfinder was introduced in 1912. Board members included former or then-current officials from the Parry Auto Company, Dayton Motor Car Company, American Ball Bearing Company, and Standard Oil.Kimes, Beverly Rae. Standard Catalog of American Cars: 1805-1942 (Iola, WI: Krause Publications, 1996), p.1156. Great things were expected from such a strong group of businessmen. One of the advertising slogans of the Pathfinder was \\"known for reliability,\\"Kimes, p.1156. but an equally high emphasis was placed on the appearances of the vehicles themselves. Examples of the latter included a boattail speedster (nearly two decades before the more famous Auburn of the same layout), a paneled storage area for the roadster's top, and vibrant paint color combinations. The Royal Automobile Club of England issued a certificate of performance to the Pathfinder for its strong performance in a time trial in 1912 covering the breadth of the isle of Great Britain, proving the cars were as durable as they were beautiful. Other long-distance outings of note included one man and his chauffeur covering 10,000 miles in the United States with no breakdowns, as well as a Pathfinder 12 driven by Walter Weidely (son of George Weidely, the designer of the engine under the hood) cross-country for a total of 4921 miles. Engines in Pathfinders started with four-cylinder engines, proceeded to six-cylinders, before culminating in Weideley 12-cylinder engines in 1916. The V-12 engined cars were called \\"Pathfinder the Great, King of the Twelves.\\" The main market for Pathfinder was producing cars for export to pre-war Russia. The beginning of World War I closed this market and Pathfinder was forced to refocus on the highly competitive US market. Wartime shortages of materials financially hindered the Pathfinder company. At the beginning of 1917, it was rumored that Pathfinder would merge with Empire. Instead, the company was gone by years end, and a new company moved into the factory to make shoe polish. The San Diego Automotive Museum has a 1912 Pathfinder Model E in their collection. All other surviving examples are in private collections.

He was mainly known for his fiction, but also explored his interest in gay and historical themes in a number of expressive drama and documentary films from the 1980s onwards. Career Film = Wells's first feature film was Desperate Remedies (1993), co-directed with Stewart Main. This take on New Zealand's colonial beginnings was selected to screen at the Cannes Film Festival, and represented an expressionistic alternative to the \\"man alone\\" machismo that dominated New Zealand film in the 1970s and 80s. = Writing = In the years that followed, Wells concentrated on developing his writing career. His short stories and novels have been widely praised. In 1996 he collaborated with theatre director Colin McColl on an operatic dramatization of Katherine Mansfield's Wellington stories, commissioned for the NZ International Festival of the Arts. Two short stories from his 1991 collection Dangerous Desires have been filmed to date: Of Memory & Desire, the tale of a Japanese couple travelling around New Zealand, was adapted by Niki Caro as her first feature film in 1997. The same year, working from a Wells script, Stewart Main directed 1960s coming of age story One of THEM! as an hour-long short. In 1998, with Stephanie Johnson, he founded the Auckland Writers Festival, and in 2016 he founded a festival to promote LGBTQI writers. = Honours and awards= Wells's 2003 novel Iridescence was a runner-up in the fiction category of the Montana New Zealand Book Awards and a finalist in the 2005 Tasmania Pacific Fiction Prize. In the 2006 New Year Honours, Wells was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to literature and film. He was awarded the Michael King Fellowship in 2011. In 2009 Wells was awarded a New Zealand non-fiction literary prize, convened by CLL (Copyright Licensing Ltd) to write a series of biographical essays on William Colenso, entitled The Hungry Heart: The Enquiring Mind. The book ‚Äúwill not be a conventional biography, but an essay series that bears directly on the episodes of heartbreak, loneliness, and sometimes horror that chequered the life of this gifted renaissance man ‚Äì printer, writer, botanist, explorer, ex-missionary and intellectual maverick‚Äù.

Special education In December 2010, the Boyertown Area School District administration reported that 1,203 pupils or 16.8% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 53.2% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the district's administration reported that 1,128 pupils or 16.1% of the district's pupils received Special Education services. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Boyertown Area School District received a $3,157,664 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12 and 2012-13 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding was provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who needed special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required or the actual costs of those services. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 363 or 5.19% of its students were gifted in 2010. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. The District Administration reported that 375 or 5.28% of its students were gifted in 2008. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying policy The Boyertown Area School District has developed an Anti-Bullying Task Force. The Task Force developed a Community/School District Anti-Bullying Action Plan. Community/School District Anti-Bullying Action Plan The Boyertown Area School District administration reported there was one incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Boyertown Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharrasment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.

Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Boyertown Area School District was $54,585 a year.

According to a study conducted at the American Enterprise Institute, in 2011, public school teachers‚Äô total compensation is roughly 50 percent higher than they would likely receive in the private sector. The study found that the most generous benefits that teachers receive are not accounted for in many studies of compensation including: pension, retiree health benefits and job security. In 2014-15, Pennsylvania public school district mandated teacher pension contribution rose to 21.40% of employee salaries and in 2015-16 it rose again to 25.84% of total salaries.

The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Boyertown Area School Board set property tax rates in 2012-13 at 21.8800 mills for Berks County residents. Montgomery County residents are taxed at 22.4900 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the Commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. On the local level, Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a state board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2011-12 - 21.8800 mills for residents in Berks County.

Montgomery County - 17.2500 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect on or before 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Boyertown Area School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. *2006-07 - 4.7%, Base 3.9% *2007-08 - 4.1%, Base 3.4% *2008-09 - 5.3%, Base 4.4% *2009-10 - 4.9%, Base 4.1% *2010-11 - 3.5%, Base 2.9% *2011-12 - 1.7%, Base 1.4% *2012-13 - 2.1%, Base 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2011 *2013-14 - 2.1%, Base - 1.7% Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-2014 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012 For the 2012-13 budget year, Boyertown Area School Board applied for 2 exceptions to exceed the Act 1 Index: teacher pensions costs and special education costs. For 2012-2013, 274 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 223 school districts adopted a preliminary budget leaving open the option of exceeded the Index limit. For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012-2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011-12 school year, Boyertown Area School Board applied for three exception to exceed the Act 1 Index:teacher pension costs, special education costs and Maintenance of Selected Revenue. Each year, Boyertown Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific mandated timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011-2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Boyertown Area School Board applied for multiple exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2010-11 which included: special education costs and pension costs. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.

Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650.

The term refers almost exclusively to the transesterification reaction of glycerol with triglycerides (fats/oils) to form mixtures of monoglycerides and diglycerides. These find a variety of uses; as food emulsifiers (e.g. E471), 'low fat' cooking oils (e.g. diacylglycerol oil) and surfactants (such as monolaurin). The transesterification process gives a complex mixture of products, however not all of these are of equivalent use. This has led to the development of optimized processes able to produce better defined products; in particular by using enzymes, reactions in supercritical carbon dioxide and flow chemistry. The production of diglycerides (often called diacylglycerols or DAGs) have been investigated extensively due to their use in foods, with total annual sales of approximately USD 200 million in Japan since its introduction in the late 1990s until 2009.

President Ohara has a health scare, so the Touzai Shimbun and Teito Times agree to focus on recipes which prolong life in the next round of the competition between, Touzai's Ultimate Menu and Teito's Supreme Menu. Kurita suggests the that team travels to Okinawa because of the long lifespan of residents there. They meet the restaurant owner, Noguchi Hatsumi, who introduces them to traditional shinji food comprised mainly of pork, vegetables and herbs, seaweed and tofu, plus the local speciality of sea snake. The group then flies to Ishigaki-jima south-west of Okinawa island, and from the airplane they see red clay soil flowing into the sea as the result of intensive commercial agriculture. They land, and learn about the planned New Ishigaki Airport in the Shiraho district which could cause a greater threat to the Shiraho Coral Reef. They encounter Kaibara who is being courted by a developer looking for support to construct a resort adjacent to the new airport. However, Kaibara refuses to help him because of his greed for short term financial gain which will destroy the ingredients of a long life. This provides a hint to Yamaoka on how to develop his menu. Back in Tokyo, the menu contest is held at the restaurant Sumitori. Kaibara presents dishes with exotic and expensive ingredients, but also says that eating any healthy food regularly is the secret to long life. Touyama then proposes that the simple diet of monks effectively enables them to live a long life. Yamaoka disagrees, and surprises everyone by arguing that the Japanese diet is not balanced, is lacking in some essential nutritional elements and is in fact unhealthy. He then presents his menu, the type of foods people should eat every day for a long life. His dishes consist of commonly available foods, combined in the appropriate proportions which provide nutrition and assist in combating disease. The second movie, was released a year later in December 1993. The next round of the competition between, Touzai's Ultimate Menu and Teito's Supreme Menu is decided to be \\"side dishes for rice\\". Daikon is the first ingredient and both Kaibara and Yamaoka present excellent samples and the contest ends in a draw. However, Kaibara announces that cheap United States rice is ruining the palates of Japanese people because they are losing the taste for aromatic rice such as kaorimai. Later, at a dinner at Touzai a heated argument develops over the upcoming trade talks between the USA and Japan over the demand to open Japanese markets to USA agricultural imports, including rice. The Deputy Prime Minister invites Yamaoka and Kurita to the talks with the Americans, who are offended when Yamaoka challenges them about the purity of their rice. Kurita arranges a second meeting where she displays her diplomatic skills and also invites Kaibara, much to Yamaoka's annoyance. Through his food and pottery, Kaibara shows the strong connection between rice and Japanese culture, but Yamaoka raises the usage of chemicals in the cultivation and post harvest transportation. He convinces the negotiators that price is not the only issue, and that both Japan and the USA must consider health and safety of the product in the trade negotiations. =Video games= *Oishinbo: Kyukyoku no Menu 3bon Syoubu (Family Computer, 1989, developed by TOSE) *Oishinbo: DS Recipe Shuu (Nintendo DS, 2007, published by Namco Bandai Games)  North American release  The manga is licensed in English in North America by Viz Media, which published the first volume in January 2009.

The amphitheatre is located in an old limestone quarry, first quarried in 1834 by Henry Trigg. The limestone from the quarry being used for construction, and lime-burning. In 1847 Trigg sold the landholdings to Walter Padbury, who continued the quarrying operations. At the height of the limestone kilns operations, more than 50 men worked at the site. The land then was sold to brothers Henry and Somers Birch in 1869, and then on to Joseph Perry in 1879. Perry kept the quarry and lime kilns working, with the last lime kiln being built in 1897. The quarrying ceased in 1906. In 1917 the land was sold to the Perth City Council The concept of converting the quarry as an amphitheatre was conceived by Diana Waldron, the director of the Perth City Ballet Company, in the early 1980s. With funding support from the Commonwealth Government, Lotteries Commission and the former City of Perth, the vision finally became a reality and the Quarry Amphitheatre was officially opened on 9 November 1986. It is set in natural bushland and supports a capacity audience of 556. It is a licensed BYO facility. The venue is used extensively between October and May for a range of events from ballet to concerts and large weddings.

Cavallo is the southernmost territory of metropolitan France and part of the commune of Bonifacio, Corsica.  Geography  Cavallo is the only inhabited island of the Lavezzi archipelago, 2.3 km from the Corsican coast, close to the Strait of Bonifacio. It is about 13 km from Sardinia. The island is French territory, though it belonged to Italy in the past. Cavallo Island is about 120 hectares in area and its highest point is 32 metres above sea level. It has a small port.  History  Cavallo has a long history, beginning when Ancient Rome sent prisoners there to cut granite for monuments. The island was abandoned during Augustus‚Äô empire, and remained uninhabited until a shepherd settled there with his flock in 1800. The deep sea surrounding the island hid dangerous obstacles for navigators, earning the island the nickname ‚ÄúThe Cursed Siren.‚Äù In 1855 the French frigate Semillante which was transporting soldiers to Crimea sank nearby and all 693 on board were lost at sea. In 1978 Cavallo made international news when it was the scene of a shooting committed by Vittorio Emanuele, the exiled king of Italy.  Tourism  Cavallo is mostly privately owned, but does allow limited access to outsiders. The coastline ownership and access to beaches is unclear although normally, as in the rest of France, open to public. Known for sailing, there is also a commercial area with a restaurant and a shop, along with the luxury Hotel & Spa des P√™cheurs. Only bicycles and electric cars are allowed on the island.

Geography Bakers Creek is located south of Mackay. The Bruce Highway and the North Coast railway line traverse the locality from south to north, passing the town which is served by the Bakers Creek railway station with a second railway station Dundula in the north of the locality. The Dundula railway station was named on 30 October 1913 by the Queensland Railways Department as an Aboriginal word meaning eucalypt tree. In turn, the surrounding neighbourhood and also the school are named Dundula. The land in Bakers Creek is flat and low-lying (under 10 metres above sea level) and is well-watered by the watercourse Bakers Creek which flows into the Coral Sea. To the north of mouth of the creek is the Bakers Creek Conservation Park. The land is predominantly used for growing sugarcane and there is a network of cane tramways to deliver the harvested sugarcane to the local sugar mills. History The locality was named after the creek, which in turn was named after John T. Baker, a customs officer in Mackay in 1863. Dundula State School opened on 28 August 1922 with 37 children enrolled on the first day, with 45 enrolled by the end of 1922. The first headmaster was Courtney Hoffman. Bakers Creek Post Office opened on 1 July 1927 (a receiving office had been open since 1909) and closed in 1979. In 1943, a USAAF aircraft crashed in the locality, killing 40 of the 41 people on board. The Bakers Creek air crash is Australia's worst aviation disaster by death toll. A memorial to the disaster was built in 1981 and is located in the grounds of the Bakers Creek Community Hall. In 1964 the Queensland Government built a meatworks. In 1978 it was sold to Thomas Borthwick & Sons who enlarged the facility. It was purchased by NH Foods in 1994 but continues to trade as Thomas Borthwick & Sons. At the 2006 census, Bakers Creek had a population of 770. Economy The main industry is a large meat processing plant operated by Thomas Borthwick & Sons (Aust) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of NH Foods. Cattle are obtained from the Central Highlands and Coalfields through to the Atherton Tablelands, North Western Districts onto the Gulf of Carpentaria. The plants supplies the domestic market as well as export markets including Chin Europe Union, Japan, the Middle East, and the United States of America. The plant is certified to produce halal meat.  Education  Dundula State School is a primary (P-6) school for boys and girls operated by the Queensland Government at 1 Main Street. In 2016, the school had an enrolment of 48 students with 4 teachers (3 full-time equivalent) and 8 non-teaching staff (3 full-time equivalent).

It has no official name so it is also known as an articulated canopy, bubble canopy,, Concept-X calls it a 'bubble canopy'. cockpit canopy,, Autoblog calls it a 'cockpit canopy'. canopy door,, Forbes Autos calls is a 'canopy door'. or simply a canopy., Auto Express calls it a 'canopy'. A canopy is a type of door which sits on top of a car and lifts up in some way, to provide access for passengers. It is similar to an aircraft canopy. There are no established sub- types of canopies, so they can be hinged at the front, side, or back, although hinging at the front is most common. Canopy doors are rarely used on production cars, and are sometimes used on concept cars. Advantages *Normal car doors open out of the car's track, so they can obstruct the road or pavement when opened. This is not an issue with canopies as they open vertically. *A-pillars are not necessary as there are no side doors, so the windscreen can extend from the front to the back of the car, giving the driver a field of vision of more than 180 degrees, The Saab Aero X on Car Body Design. and minimising blind spots. A-pillars are sometimes still added, such as in the Sterling Nova, to give the car a more conventional look. Disadvantages *Air-conditioning or climate control is necessary with an all-glass canopy or with a wrap-around windscreen because the canopy provides substantial 'greenhouse effect'.Maserati Birdcage 75th#Bodywork, Maserati Birdcage 75th on Wikipedia. *In the case of a rollover accident, exiting the vehicle would be impossible, short of breaking the glass. *Entering and exiting the vehicle can be hard with a high sill and awkward roof positioning. This problem was overcome with the Saab Aero X, which has a 3 part canopy to fully open the interior. *In situations of bad weather such as snow, rain, or hail, it is impossible to enter or exit the vehicle without getting the interior wet, unless under cover (you would also have to clear any significant snow accumulation off of the roof or it would be too heavy to lift). Cars that use canopies This is not a full list of cars that use canopies, but just a few examples. =Messerschmitts= Messerschmitt KR175 Messerschmitt, the notable German aeroplane manufacturer, weren't allowed to produce aircraft after World War II. Instead, they produced cars. These were designed by the aircraft engineer Fritz Fend.Messerschmitt#Post-war, Messerschmitt on Wikipedia. A vehicle canopy was a new concept that is believed to be invented by Messerschmitt; this originated from their aircraft design. They quickly adopted the canopy as this was a simple solution that they had experience in. Unlike most car canopies, the Messerschmitt canopies are hinged on the side, as was the canopy of their famous Bf 109 fighter (as was common with numerous other pre-war and wartime fighter designs). A problem with side hinging, is that for a car with normal side-by-side seating arrangement, the passengers sitting closest to the hinge will have to climb across the outer seat to get out of the car. For that reason the side-hinging canopy is best suited for single-occupant or tandem-seat cars, and after this, canopies were usually hinged at the front or back. 1953 Messerschmitt KR175 The KR175 was the first car, production or concept, to have a canopy. In 1956, the model was changed to the Messerschmitt KR200.Messerschmitt KR200, Messerschmitt KR200 on Wikipedia. 1956 Messerschmitt KR200 The most noticeable thing about the KR200 is its distinctive bubble canopy, which gave rise to the term 'bubble car'. The KR200 continued Messerschmitt's side-hinged canopies. These were usually transparent acrylic (\\"Plexiglas\\" or \\"Perspex\\"), though reproductions are car-safe polymethyl methacrylate. =1970 Ferrari Modulo concept car= Only one unit of the Ferrari 512 S Modulo was built, to a design by Pininfarina. =1970 Bond Bug= The Bond Bug is a small 3-wheeled sports car and was the first production car to use a front-hinged canopy. =1971 Nova kit car= Other than the Purvis Eureka (a licensed copy of the Nova) and the Bond Bug, the Nova is the only production car to date to use a front-hinged canopy door. The windscreen has small A-pillars so it looks like a conventional car when the canopy is closed. =1985 Buick Wildcat concept car= The 1985 Buick Wildcat concept car had a canopy., The Buick Wildcat on How Stuff Works. The style of canopy it used is an extended canopy, as it is composed of much of the front bodywork, and not just the passenger compartment. A canopy was used in this concept car as it was thought to be futuristic. = 2002 Volkswagen 1-litre car = The concept Volkswagen 1-litre car, VW 1L, uses a canopy door. The 2013 production version of this concept used butterfly doors. =2005 Maserati Birdcage 75th concept car= The Maserati Birdcage 75th lacks conventional doors, instead, it uses an extended canopy system. The demonstrator model lacks air-conditioning and so journalists (including Evo Magazine's Harry Metcalfe) experienced the previously-mentioned 'glasshouse effect': whilst driving the vehicle they were reportedly forced to keep the bubble slightly open on hot days to cool the car's interior. =2006 Saab Aero-X concept car= The 3 part canopy on a Saab Aero-X. The Aero X's top canopy is styled on the one of the Saab aeroplanes, and this was their inspiration for using a canopy. The canopy opens by remote control, and there is a lever to close it again., Saab Aero X. The three-piece canopy eliminates the problems like a high sill and awkwardly angled roof, although the mechanisms are more complex and so heavier, and more likely to fail; leaving an occupant stranded inside a car. The canopy includes a wrap- around windscreen and a glass roof, side windows and body panels (which lift upwards, lowering the sills), and the top roof section of the interior fascia (which moves inwards so it doesn't obstruct entry/exit). These sections intricately manoeuvre themselves into a position where they take up as little space as possible. This construction eliminates the need for doors and A-pillars and so the windscreen extends from B-pillar to B-pillar, which has the important benefit of improving overall visibility. = Batmobile = Various models of the Batmobile used in the production of the Batman films make use of the canopy door. = Custom cars = Bubble canopies are popular on some custom cars, most notably those by Ed Roth, such as the Orbitron, Road Agent and Beatnik Bandit. = Lamborghini = Lamborghini Egoista, the company's 50th anniversary celebration car, has this kind of door. It is designed to look like a fighter jet.

The feedlines feeding radio power from the transmitter to the huge flattop wire antenna are visible, top. A list of early wireless telegraphy radio stations of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co. Guglielmo Marconi developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers between 1895 and 1901. His company, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Co, started in 1897, dominated the early radio industry. During the first two decades of the 20th century the Marconi Co. built the first radiotelegraphy communication stations, which were used to communicate with ships at sea and exchange commercial telegram traffic with other countries using Morse code. Many of these have since been preserved as historic places. Types of station The first radio transmitters could not transmit audio (sound) like modern AM and FM transmitters, and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy; the transmitter was turned on and off rapidly using a switch called a telegraph key, creating different length pulses of radio waves (\\"dots\\" and \\"dashes\\") which spelled out text messages in Morse code. Marconi used several types of station: =Coastal stations= Coastal stations communicated with wireless stations on ships, providing navigation and weather information and relayed communications from ships to other coastal stations and through telegraph systems. Ships were allowed to communicate on three frequencies: 500, 660, and 1000 kHz. =Transoceanic stations= Transoceanic wireless telegraph stations were large high powered stations with huge antenna structures, with output power of 100 kW to one megawatt. Industrial countries built worldwide networks of these stations to exchange telegram traffic with other nations at intercontinental distances and communicate with a country's overseas colonies. To achieve daylight communication at such long ranges they used frequencies in the very low frequency (VLF) band, from 50 to as low as 15 ‚Äì 20 kHz. They transmitted Morse code at high speed, 100 - 200 words per minute, using automated paper tape readers. Australia In 1906, the Marconi Company constructed an experimental station at Queenscliff, Victoria, successfully communicating between the Australian continent and Devonport, Tasmania. This station operated on a temporary basis; subsequent Australian wireless efforts would be undertaken by Amalgamated Wireless Australasia, established in 1913 under ownership of Marconi, its commercial arch-rival Telefunken and Australian local business interests.  Canada  The Marconi Company has owned or operated Canadian coastal radio stations since 1902, either as transatlantic radiotelegraph links or as marine radio stations. While eastern Canada's ship-to-shore coastal stations were government-owned after 1915, the Marconi Company had been paid to continue to operate the facilities. Canada's west coast had been served by government-operated stations since 1907; many stations in the Canadian arctic were military operations. The Canadian Marconi Company operated manufacturing facilities at Montreal, Quebec and in 1919 had established on an experimental basis the first commercial broadcast radio station, XWA.Canadian Communications Foundation broadcast history for XWA/CFCF/CFCX Montr√©al This operation would become CFCF (AM/FM/TV) and CFCX (shortwave); Marconi would be forced to sell the stations due to foreign- ownership restrictions imposed on Canadian broadcast stations in 1970. The manufacturing operations have now become Ultra Electronics TCS for tactical radio systems and Esterline CMC Electronics for avionic systems. Since 1954, the federal Department of Transport has operated former Marconi coastal stations in eastern Canada; most served the Great Lakes and the Atlantic coast: * VAY Cape Hopes Advance, Ungava Bay (July 1, 1929 - ) * VBC Midland, Ontario (July 8, 1912 - ) * VBH Kingston, Ontario (January 9, 1914 - ) * VBK Trois-Rivi√®res, Qu√©bec * VCC Qu√©bec, Qu√©bec (1910 - ) * VCD Grosse Isle, Quebec(until 1927) * VCI Heath Point, Anticosti Island (July 21, 1904 ‚Äì 1921) * VCO North Sydney, Nova Scotia (1907 - ) = Glace Bay, Nova Scotia = On December 15, 1902 Marconi established transatlantic communication between Table Head in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia and Poldhu in Cornwall, England using a 60 kilowatt transmitter and four towers. The site was expanded and moved inland in 1904-05, increasing both antenna size and transmitter power. Transatlantic radio service between the Marconi Towers and Clifden, Ireland was inaugurated in October 1907, and continued until the Marconi station (operating under callsign VAS, Voice of the Atlantic Seaboard) was shut down and the property sold in 1946. The site of the Marconi Towers station is now used to house a museum. = Halifax, Nova Scotia = In 1905, Marconi constructed a wireless station at Camperdown, Halifax, Nova Scotia (original callsign HX, MHX from 1907‚Äì1912, VCS thereafter). From 1905 until 1926, this station was to collect traffic from Sable Island (VCT) and Cape Sable (VCU) for manual retransmission via dedicated landline telegraph circuit to Halifax (AX). VCS later would serve as a coast guard marine radio station. = Louisbourg, Nova Scotia = As the original, powerful spark gap transmitters would create large quantities of electrical interference, stations could not transmit and receive at the same time - even if different wavelengths were used. By 1913, the increasing amount of transatlantic radio telegraph traffic required that existing half-duplex operation be upgraded to a link which could carry messages in both directions at the same time. This was done by geographically separating the receiving stations from the existing transmitter sites; new receiving stations at Letterfrack, Ireland and Louisbourg, Nova Scotia effectively doubled the capacity of the Marconi Company to carry transatlantic telegraph traffic. Instead of the 500 kHz and 1 MHz frequencies common in shipboard radio at the time, Marconi was to use longwave frequencies of 37.5 kHz for transmission from Glace Bay, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia to Letterfrack and 54.5 kHz for transmission from Clifden, Ireland to Louisbourg in order to establish reliable transatlantic communication day and night. Antennas for longwave radio reception were to occupy huge amounts of land at these sites; while Lee de Forest's work had produced a vacuum tube (or \\"Audion\\") as early as 1906, many key advances in electronic amplifiers (which would allow smaller receiving antennas and more efficient transmitter designs) would only be made once improved communications became a military necessity during World War I. The design and construction of tuned circuits able to separate radio signals transmitted and received at different frequency and wavelength had also shown great improvement. By 1919, improved transmitting and receiving tubes had made transatlantic voice transmission possible. By 1926 Marconi would be able to use shortwave radio to link the British Empire, making the former long-wave transatlantic service and its Louisbourg receiving station obsolete. The Marconi Towers transmitter site on Cape Breton was upgraded to broadcast voice and operated until 1945; the Louisbourg station closed in 1926. = Pointe-au-P√®re, Qu√©bec = As the nominal point of entry to the St. Lawrence River from the sea, Pointe-au-P√®re has hosted four lighthouse stations since 1859. A Marconi radiotelegraph station was constructed in 1909. Arriving transatlantic liners would unload mail and take on harbour pilots; Pointe-au-P√®re also provided a hydrographic station and a quarantine post. On May 29, 1914 the Pointe-au-P√®re Marconi station received an SOS call from the RMS Empress of Ireland, a Canadian passenger liner which, surrounded by fog, had been hit by Norwegian coal freighter SS Storstad. \\"May have struck ship... listing terribly\\" reported Marconi operators Edward Bamford and Ronald Ferguson, notifying rescuers on shore of their position twenty miles seaward of Rimouski as the vessel rapidly took on water. In 14 minutes, this collision was to claim 1,012 lives. France On 27 March 1899, Marconi transmitted from Wimereux, Boulogne, France the first international wireless message which was received at the South Foreland Lighthouse near Dover, United Kingdom. Ireland Ireland was, due to its western location, to play a key role in early efforts to send messages initially from ship to shore, and later for transatlantic messages. = Crookhaven = In 1902, a Marconi telegraphic station was established in the village of Crookhaven, County Cork, Ireland to provide marine radio communications to ships arriving from the Americas. A ship's master could contact shipping line agents ashore to enquire which port was to receive their cargo without the need to come ashore at what was the first port of landfall. = Clifden, Galway = As existing submarine cable operators in the early 1900s had held a monopoly on international telegraph service to Newfoundland, Marconi's first regular transatlantic wireless service was established on October 17, 1907 between Derrygimla Bog, Clifden, Galway, Ireland and Glace Bay, Nova Scotia. An additional Marconi receiving station in Letterfrack, Ireland operated briefly from 1913 until 1917. Due to destruction caused by the Irish Civil War in 1922, traffic formerly carried at Clifden was permanently redirected via Marconi's new station at Ongar in Essex, a link which remained in service until replaced by the Canadian shortwave beam circuit in October 1926. On June 15, 1919, the first non-stop transatlantic aeroplane crossing by Capt. John Alcock and Lt. Arthur Brown left Newfoundland and made an unplanned landing at the Marconi site in Clifden, Ireland. = Ballybunion = Despite references in several publications, Ballybunion Station was not built by Marconi, and never operated commercially. The station was built by the Universal Radio Syndicate. Construction started in 1912, but the station had not obtained a commercial licence by the time World War 1 started. The company went into liquidation in 1915. A sister station at Newcastle New Brunswick, built to the same design as Ballybunion, suffered a similar fate. The Marconi Company bought the two stations from the liquidator in 1919, mainly to prevent their use by potential competitors. The stations were not idle in the interim, however, having been appropriated by the British Admiralty almost immediately upon outbreak of the Great War and kept in constant activity as key components of the allied communication system until the Armistice of November 1918. The Marconi Company did not use the stations commercially, and it would appear that the Ballybunion station was only used briefly, in March 1919 for a successful telephony experiment with the Marconi station in Louisbourg, and for communication with the R34 airship in July 1919. In March 1919, Marconi engineers H.J Round and W.T. Ditcham made the first east-west transatlantic broadcast of voice, using valve technology, from the Ballybunion station using the callsignYXQ. The first west to east voice transmission had already been achieved by Bell Systems engineers from the US Navy station at Arlington Virginia to the Eiffel Tower in October 1915. The contents of Clifden and Ballybunion were sold for scrap to a Sheffield-based scrap merchant, Thos. W. Ward in 1925.  India  A Marconi radiotelegraph station had been operational at Delhi, India at the time the Indian capital had moved there from Calcutta in 1911. Marconi had constructed experimental broadcast transmitters in Calcutta, which were to become 2BZ (Calcutta Radio Club, 1923) and 5AF (West Bengal government); these radio stations operated until the national government established a station in 1927.  Italy  On November 13, 1910 the first radio message to Africa was sent from a radiotelegraph station at Coltano, Italy and received in Massaua (then part of the Italian colony of Eritrea). Italy's King Vittorio Emanuele officially opened the station in 1911, at which time messages were sent from Coltano to Glace Bay (Canada) and Massaua.  Newfoundland  The first transatlantic radio message, transmitted from Marconi's Poldhu, Cornwall transmitter, was received 12 December 1901 at Signal Hill, St. John's, Newfoundland. Subsequent efforts at transatlantic communications would use Cape Breton, Nova Scotia as a Canadian terminus due to the Anglo-American Telegraph Company's entrenched monopoly in the Dominion of Newfoundland. Messages for ships at sea would continue to be handled in Newfoundland, due to its strategic location as point of first contact in the east. As of 1915, the following coastal stations were operational in Newfoundland to connect the island to otherwise-isolated outports in Labrador and to handle vital ship-to-shore communication: * VCE Cape Race (1904‚Äì1966, originally CE or MCE) * VCM Belle Island * VCR Cape Ray * VOA Battle Harbour, Labrador * VOB Venison Island * VOC American Tickle * VOD Domino * VOE Grady * VOF Smokey Tickle * VOG Holton * VOH Cape Harrison * VOI Makkovik * VOJ Fogo (1912‚Äì1933) * VOJH Corner Brook (1940‚Äì1974) * VON Cabot Tower/Signal Hill, St. John's (until 1960) = Newfoundland coastal stations = All radio stations licensed by the Dominion of Newfoundland after 1912 and before the April 1st, 1949 confederation bear callsigns beginning with VO. Stations built by the Marconi Company of Canada in outlying areas such as Fogo (VOJ) were funded by the Dominion of Newfoundland and served to report ice and weather conditions, provide communications with sealing vessels and transmit messages from Newfoundland to Labrador coastal fisheries. By the 1930s, original spark gap transmitter equipment at these sites would have been removed due to severe interference caused to broadcast radio operations. = Cape Race and Cape Ray = Canadian Marconi Company stations with Canadian VC calls did exist on Newfoundland in the wireless telegraph era, even though Newfoundland was not part of Canada. These stations were permitted by Newfoundland authorities to operate solely in communication with ships at sea; transatlantic radiotelegraph service to land-based stations in the United Kingdom and Europe operated from Cape Breton in Canada. Exploiting a strategic location at the south-easternmost part of Newfoundland, the Cape Race (VCE) station could serve as a vital first point of contact for arriving ships in the New World, as well as providing telegram service to transatlantic passenger liners. Messages received from travellers crossing the Atlantic could be relayed in a timely fashion to much of North America, including major cities such as New York, long before a ship's arrival. A lighthouse and direction-finding radio were also once active at this site The Cape Race site, active as a coast radio station until 1966, is now home to the Myrick Communications Museum and a radioamateur commemorative station, VO1MCE. A copy of April 1912 station logs (documenting communication between Cape Race and Titanic) appear in the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Cape Ray (VCR) and Belle Isle (VCM) stations, which played a similar role, served ocean-going liners in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Spain  On February 1, 1912 a new Marconi station erected at Aranjuez near Madrid, Spain transmitted a message from King Alfonso which would be received at Poldhu, Cornwall, England for delivery to the London correspondent of the New York Times.  South Africa  In the Boer War era of 1899, Marconi wireless equipment would face one of its first tests in military deployment with mixed results. Initial attempts to deploy land-based military radio were problematic, but the five Marconi installations in March 1900 on naval cruisers HMS Dwarf, Forte, Magicienne, Racoon and Thetis proved successful. By 1912, Marconi stations covered Aden, Algeria, Australia, Azores, Belgium, Brazil, Burma, China, Cura√ßao, France, French Guyana, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Jamaica, Mexico, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia, Senegal, South Africa, Sweden, Tobago, Trinidad, Uruguay, Zanzibar, and the Pacific Ocean. Efforts in 1926 to build an Imperial Wireless Chain spanning the globe would bring new construction of Marconi wireless facilities to much of the British Empire, including South Africa and India. Shortwave radio would deployed as a means to communicate internationally with smaller transmitters and more directional antennas than had been possible on the former longwave system. These directional-antenna (or \\"beam antenna\\") installations were known as the Imperial Beam system; Marconi Beam as a geographic place name still refers to a section of modern Cape Town, South Africa, as one location where such facilities historically had operated.  United Kingdom  In December 1898, the Marconi Company opened the first wireless factory at Chelmsford in Essex. Marconi stations in the United Kingdom would be the first to be received internationally in France and later Newfoundland. A message received in 1910 in the UK from Marconi-equipped ship S.S. Montrose, then en route to Canada, would prove key to the arrest of fugitive Hawley Harvey Crippen. A station existed at Devizes but its use was interrupted by the Great War. = Poldhu, Cornwall = Marconi's Poldhu wireless station, showing 200 ft. antenna constructed after transatlantic transmission. Marconi's station at Poldhu, Cornwall, England, initially constructed in October 1900 on a cliff in a remote location to avoid publicity during initial experimentation, was the first large radio transmitter in the world. Marconi decided in 1899 to attempt transatlantic communication. This required higher power; prior to this transmitters used induction coils with an output power of 100-200 watts, with maximum range of about 150 miles. He hired an electric power expert, Prof. John Ambrose Fleming, who designed and built a complex spark transmitter with three cascaded tuned circuits and two spark gaps, powered by a 25 kW generator turned by a combustion engine. This fed an inverted conical wire antenna consisting of 200 wires suspended from a circle of wooden masts. The frequency used is not known precisely as Marconi did not measure frequency or wavelength, but is thought to have been around 500 kHz. By 1901 it had transmitted messages to ships at sea over distances of more than 200 miles. On December 12, 1901, the first transatlantic message from the Poldhu wireless station was received at St. John's in the Dominion of Newfoundland, a distance of 2100 miles (3300 km). Reliable transatlantic communication was not achieved until several years later with a more powerful transmitter. In 1905 transatlantic communication was shifted to a new lower frequency transmitter at Clifden, Ireland. The Poldhu station was used for communication with Atlantic shipping and European countries until 1922, then as a research station until 1934 when it was dismantled. A Marconi memorial remains at this site today. = Dover, Kent = In 1898, Marconi began tests of ship-to-shore communication between Trinity House Lighthouse, Dover, Kent, England and the East Goodwin lightship. In 1899, South Foreland Lighthouse at St. Margaret's Bay, Dover was used by Guglielmo Marconi to receive the first international transmission (from Wimereux, France). Dover received the first ship-to-shore message (from the East Goodwin lightship) and the first ship-to- shore distress message (when a steamship ran into the same lightship, and the lighthouse relayed the message up the coast to the Walmer lifeboat). =Newhaven, East Sussex = The Newhaven Marconi Radio Station was established at Newhaven, East Sussex in 1904, and started running in 1905. The station achieved ship to shore radio communications around 1912. = Tetney, Lincolnshire = A station at Tetney, Lincolnshire, England, constructed as part of the Imperial Wireless Chain linking the nations of the British Empire, established shortwave communications with Australia in April 1927 and India in September 1927. =Caernarvon, Wales = In 1914, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company constructed a 400 KW wireless transmitting station (callsign MUU) in Caernarvon to send transatlantic messages to the US from ten 400-foot masts atop Cefndu mountain in Snowdonia. The station served throughout World War I and remained in operation until 1939. On September 22, 1918 the first wireless telegraph message to Australia was sent from Snowdonia. On September 22, 1918, advances in vacuum tube receivers allowed the MUU signal to be received by the Amalgamated Wireless Australasia station at \\"Logan Brae\\", Pymble in Sydney, Australia. In 1922, the Marconi transmitting station at Caernarvon, Wales replaced the former station at Clifden, Galway, Ireland for transatlantic message traffic following destruction of Marconi's Clifden station during the Irish Civil War. The obsolete Clifden Station was never rebuilt. A companion receiving station was situated 40 miles further south at Towyn.  United States  The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America (American Marconi), incorporated in New Jersey in 1899, had by 1908 deployed five land stations and 40 marine stations. It would operate wireless stations until, with the entry of the United States into World War I, the US Navy assumed wartime control of wireless. It would continue manufacturing activities until the American Marconi factory in Aldene, NJ was acquired by General Electric in 1919 and its wireless operations and facilities were acquired by the Radio Corporation of America in 1920. = New Jersey = Marconi's transatlantic radiotelegraph stations were deployed in pairs; a station near New Brunswick, New Jersey would transmit while another at Belmar would receive the weak signals from across the Atlantic. American Marconi had also established a factory in 1907 in Aldene, New Jersey. New Brunswick Marconi Station () was located at JFK Boulevard and Easton Avenue just a few minutes from the New Brunswick border in Somerset, New Jersey. Today it is the site of Marconi Park. It was an early radio transmitter facility built in 1913 and operated by the American Marconi. After the partial failure of transatlantic telegraph cables, the facility was confiscated by the US Navy in January, 1918 to provide vital transatlantic communications during World War I. The New Brunswick Naval Radio Station was the principal wartime communication link between the United States and Europe, using the callsign NFF. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points speech was transmitted by NFF in 1918. Ownership of the station, along with Marconi's other US stations, were transferred from the Navy to RCA in 1920. The antenna masts were demolished in 1952 to make room for what is now a small mall containing a Kmart, but the buildings on the other side of JFK Boulevard were spared. All but one of the brick buildings were demolished around 2004 to make way for a storage locker facility. The bricks and tiles were saved for use in any future restoration of the spared building, and the second facility in Belmar, New Jersey. The Belmar Marconi receiving station was located at what are now Camp Evans buildings in Belmar, New Jersey. The original buildings were built by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America under a contract to the J.G. White Engineering Corp. between 1912 and 1914 as part of Guglielmo Marconi's \\"wireless girdle\\" around the Earth. It was then known as the Belmar Station (). The Belmar Station served as Marconi's receiving station, \\"duplexed\\" with his New Brunswick () high power transmitting station. An operator in Belmar keyed the New Brunswick transmitter, to the northwest, through a landline connection. Edwin Armstrong and David Sarnoff tested and perfected the regenerative circuit at the Belmar site, on the night of January 31/February 1, 1914. Albert Hoyt Taylor, who later made important contributions toward the development of radar, was Communication Superintendent at the station during World War I. The station was closed in 1924, after receiver functions were transferred to RCA's new Radio Central receiver site on Long Island, NY. = New York = As early as March 1, 1904, messages for steamship passengers at sea were accepted at Western Union landline telegraph offices, where they would be transmitted overland to Sagaponack or Babylon, New York and delivered to Marconi Wireless Telegraph for transmission to steamships of the Cunard Line, American Line, French Line, North German Lloyd Line, Atlantic Transport Line, Hamburg-American Line or Red Star Line. In 1912, a Marconi station atop the Wanamaker's Department Store building in New York City was to receive a list of RMS Titanic passengers aboard the RMS Carpathia, delivering the news to Hearst newspapers before the ship's arrival. An operator at this station, David Sarnoff, would go on to lead the Radio Corporation of America. = Cape Cod, Massachusetts = A Marconi station built in 1902 at South Wellfleet, Cape Cod, Massachusetts (initial callsign CC, MCC 1908 to 1911, finally WCC from 1911,) transmitted its first telegraphic message via spark gap transmitter in 1903 from what is now known as the National Park Service \\"Marconi Area,\\" about a mile north of the entrance to Marconi Beach. Marine radio traffic carried before the station closed in 1917 included news and telegrams for passengers of the RMS Lusitania, distress calls from the RMS Titanic in 1912 and a message between the American president and the British king in 1903. The South Wellfleet antennas and equipment were dismantled by the U.S. Navy in 1919, replaced by Marconi's new receiver station built in 1914 in Chatham, Massachusetts and its paired transmitter station also built in 1914 in Marion, Massachusetts. The South Wellfleet site is now part of the Cape Cod National Seashore, the Chatham receiver site is now operated as a museum by the Chatham Marconi Maritime Center, and most of the 143 acres of the Marion Station were donated to the Sippican Lands Trust, where hundreds of artifacts remain publicly accessible. The Marion Station transmitter building is operated as a private business and the hotel and three bungalows are privately owned. The original tower still stands to this day, and is used for the antennas for local police/fire telecommunications. = Point Reyes, California = WCC is just one of two former Marconi stations on US national parkland; a California coastal radio station (callsign KPH), formerly operated by Marconi and later RCA, is located at Point Reyes National Seashore. In 1913, an American Marconi Company transmitting station was established at Bolinas. The receiving station KPH was about twenty miles further north, in the town of Marshall, at Point Reyes. In 1914, the stations at Bolinas and Marshall would allow messages received from New Brunswick, New Jersey to be retransmitted to Hawaii. KPH has been preserved by volunteer members of the Maritime Radio Historical Society and is operated at weekends and on special occasions such as International Marconi Day and the anniversary of the \\"end of commercial Morse code in America.\\" The station volunteers also use the alternative callsign KSM and amateur radio club callsign K6KPH. = Bolinas, California = Built in 1919 by Marconi, it was taken over in 1920 by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). = Hawaii = Marconi's radiotelegraph was to serve both as a means of establishing communications between the various Hawaiian Islands and as a means to receive messages from the Americas (notably California and Panama) for retransmission to Japan and Asia. In the early days of wireless communications, Marconi used the Hawaiian Islands as a test run. His future plans included creating an international wireless network. Hawaii was the small scale, with the largest distance of approximately 78 miles. Marconi was able to improve his system when in Hawaii, and received very good reviews from the governor of Hawaii. In 1912, the Marconi Company proposed what it billed as \\"A Wireless Girdle around the Earth\\"; proposing that as a station in Great Britain could communicate with one in Belmar, New Jersey (serving New York City), that station in turn could reach Panama and from there a signal could be sent to Hawaii. A powerful station constructed in Hawaii could by 1914 reach San Francisco, California, receiving messages which could be transmitted to the Philippines once a later station was constructed there. From Manila, Philippines, messages eventually could be resent to a British station in Singapore which would then reach Bangalore, India. From there, a signal sent to a station in Africa could eventually be retransmitted to Egypt or Cyprus, and the Egyptian station would reach London. In 1915, the New York Times announced \\"The opening of the Japanese Marconi wireless plant at Funabashi near Yokohama with messages on Tuesday to the Marconi station at Kahuku, Hawaii, extended the Marconi service nearly two-thirds the way around the globe. If the war had not interfered with the creation of the British Imperial chain, it might have been possible by this time to relay a message by wireless all the way around the world.\\" A Marconi station at Kahuku on the North Shore of Oahu, Hawaii was later operated by RCA; the site was re-purposed as an air base during World War II and is now abandoned. The property on which the old Marconi station sits, is referred to as Makai Ranch. The buildings currently sit vacant, as the owner is awaiting eminent domain transfer or permits before restoration can begin.

It appears to be used as a rest stop for long-distance buses A roadhouse (Australia and the United States) or stopping house (Canada) is a small mixed-use premises typically built on or near a major road in a sparsely populated area or an isolated desert region that services the passing travellers, providing food, drinks, accommodation, fuel and parking spaces to the guests and their vehicles. The premises generally consist of just a single dwelling, permanently occupied by a nuclear family, usually between two and five family members. In Australia, a roadhouse is often considered to be the smallest type of human settlement.I spent the night in Australia's smallest town. Here's what I saw The word's meaning varies slightly by country. The historical equivalent was often known as a coaching inn, providing food, drinks, and rest to people and horses. North America Klondike, Yukon, 1898 The \\"roadhouse\\" or \\"road house\\" acts as a restaurant, serving meals, especially in the evenings. It has a bar serving beer or hard liquor and features music, dancing, and sometimes gambling. Most roadhouses are located along highways or roads in rural areas or on the outskirts of towns. Early roadhouses provided lodging for travelers, but with the advent of faster means of transport than walking, horseback riding, or horse-drawn carriages, few now offer rooms to let. Roadhouses have a slightly disreputable image, similar to honky tonks. This type of roadhouse has been portrayed in movies such as Road House (1948), The Wild One, Easy Rider, and Road House (1989). Historically, roadhouses sprang up when significant numbers of people began to move to the frontier. In Western Canada they were known as stopping houses. From the 1890s in Alaska and the Yukon, beginning with the gold rush,Historic Roadhouses Along the Yukon roadhouses were checkpoints where dog drivers (mushers, or dog sledders), horse-driven sleighs, and people on snowshoes, skis, or walking would stop overnight for shelter and a hot meal. Remains of a Klondike Gold Rush roadhouse can be seen today south of Carmacks, Yukon along the Klondike Highway.The Rapids Roadhouse: History, Black Rapids website One built in 1902 is the Black Rapids Roadhouse; another still operating is Rika's Landing Roadhouse. Australia The Queen Bee Roadhouse at Ouyen, Victoria, Australia. In Australia a roadhouse is a filling station (service station) on a major intercity route. A roadhouse sells fuel and provides maintenance and repairs for cars, but it also has an attached \\"restaurant\\" (more like a caf√© or diner) to sell and serve hot food to travellers. Roadhouses usually also serve as truck stops, providing space for parking of semi-trailer trucks and buses, as well as catering to travellers in private cars. In remote areas such as the Nullarbor Plain, a roadhouse also offers motel-style accommodation and camping facilities. Britain The Dutch House, a typical British 1930s coaching inn on the busy A20 road in Eltham, Greater London. In Britain, wayside lodgings of this type were called coaching inns. As in other countries, they were originally a place along the road for people travelling on foot or by horse to stay at night, but today they are often restaurants or pubs without lodging. However, many coaching inns, especially those in rural counties, have kept their accommodation to become bed and breakfasts or country hotels. With the advent of popular travel by motor car in the 1920s and 1930s, a new type of roadside pub emerged, often located on the newly constructed arterial roads and bypasses. They were large establishments offering meals, refreshment and accommodation to motorists and parties travelling by charabanc. The largest pubs boasted facilities such as tennis courts and swimming pools. Their popularity ended with the outbreak of the Second World War when recreational road travel became impossible, and the advent of post-war drink driving legislation prevented their full recovery. Spain Post houses (casas de postas) were established in major towns and along principal highways. Post masters provided fresh horses, and sometimes carriages and over-night accommodation for use by Royal officers called Postillones, who were uniformed guides authorised to conduct passengers, goods and messages along specific routes.From the latest collections of Juan de la Reguera y Valdelomar (Google book) In popular culture *\\"Roadhouse Blues,\\" a song by The Doors *The Roadhouse from Twin Peaks, a local music bar on the outskirts of the main town *Road House (1948 film), directed by Jean Negulesco and starring Cornel Wilde and Ida Lupino *Road House (1989 film), starring Patrick Swayze as a bouncer at a bar See also * Charging station * Fast food restaurant * Index of drinking establishment-related articles * Rest area References Category:Restaurants by type Category:Hotel types Category:Horse-related professions and professionals Category:Transport infrastructure Category:Drinking establishments in Europe Category:Tourist accommodations ","title":"Roadhouse (premises)"},{"id":"17935143","text":"Nylund may refer to: * Nylund, a neighborhood (delomr√•de) in the borough Storhaug in Stavanger, Norway * Nylund, a surname of Scandinavian origin meaning \\"new grove\\" People * Camilla Nylund (born 1968), Finnish soprano * Eric Nylund (born 1964), American science fiction author * Gary Nylund (born 1963), Canadian hockey player * Mattias Nylund (born 1980), Swedish soccer player * Olav Kjetilson Nylund (1903‚Äì1957), Norwegian politician * Ossian Nylund, Finnish track and field athlete * Sven Nylund (1894‚Äì1975), Swedish diver Other * Rose Nylund, fictional character on the situation comedy, The Golden Girls ","title":"Nylund (disambiguation)"},{"id":"17935149","text":"Bob Morris (born May 25, 1950) is an American novelist who writes Caribbean- themed mysteries. He is also the author of several collections of nonfiction, including Gut Check, Short Road to Hell, The Man with the Fish on His Foot, All Over the Map, and The Whole Shebang. Morris is president of Story Farm, a custom publishing company that creates books, magazines and other publications for a wide variety of clients. He is an adjunct professor at Rollins College and teaches courses in food writing and crime fiction.  Biography  Bob Morris is a fourth-generation Floridian who forsook the family farm ‚Äì a fernery in Lake County ‚Äì to pursue a career in journalism. The route was indirect. After failing two consecutive terms of organic chemistry, Morris decided he was not cut out to be a marine biologist and set out to travel around the world instead. His travels took him to a farming commune in Israel where his responsibilities included shoveling out the daily deposits of 12,000 chickens and 12,000 turkeys. After graduating from the University of Florida, Morris went on to work at a number of newspapers, including the Florida Keys Free Press, the Fort Myers News-Press, the Orlando Sentinel, and the New York Times Regional Newspaper Group. Among his achievements is founding the annual Queen Kumquat Sashay, a parade in downtown Orlando founded in 1986 and discontinued in 1997. Morris and his family spent two years in Santa Barbara, California, where he created and launched AQUA, an international travel magazine for watersports enthusiasts. Upon returning to Florida in 1999, he was editor in chief of Caribbean Travel & Life magazine and Gulfshore Life magazine. Now a freelance writer and editor, Morris continues to travel widely and contributes to a number of publications, including National Geographic Traveler, Bon App√©tit, Islands, Robb Report, Latitudes and Men's Fitness. These travels have inspired his recent series of mystery novels from St. Martin's Press, each of which takes place on a different Caribbean island. The first one, Bahamarama, was released in November 2004 and was a finalist for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Mystery Novel and chosen by the Library Journal as one the year's Top Five Mysteries. Morris's second novel, Jamaica Me Dead, was released in October 2005 and was a BookSense Pick by the American Booksellers Association.

Mathematical properties  The curve used is y^2 = x^3 + 486662x^2 + x, a Montgomery curve, over the prime field defined by the prime number 2^{255} - 19, and it uses the base point x = 9. This point generates a cyclic subgroup whose order is the prime 2^{252} + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493 and is of index 8. Using a prime order subgroup prevents mounting a Pohlig‚ÄìHellman algorithm attack. The protocol uses compressed elliptic point (only X coordinates), so it allows efficient use of the Montgomery ladder for ECDH, using only XZ coordinates. Curve25519 is constructed such that it avoids many potential implementation pitfalls. By design, it is immune to timing attacks and it accepts any 32-byte string as a valid public key and does not require validating that a given point belongs to the curve, or is generated by the base point. The curve is birationally equivalent to a twisted Edwards curve used in the Ed25519 signature scheme.  History  In 2005, Curve25519 was first released by Daniel J. Bernstein. In 2013, interest began to increase considerably when it was discovered that the NSA had potentially implemented a backdoor into Dual_EC_DRBG. While not directly related, suspicious aspects of the NIST's P curve constantshttps://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ led to concerns that the NSA had chosen values that gave them an advantage in breaking the encryption. Since 2013, Curve25519 has become the de facto alternative to P-256, being used in a wide variety of applications. Starting in 2014, OpenSSH defaults to Curve25519-based ECDH. Behavior for general SSH protocol is still being standardized as of 2018. In 2017, NIST announced that Curve25519 and Curve448 would be added to Special Publication 800-186, which specifies approved elliptic curves for use by the US Federal Government. Both are described in \\"RFC 7748\\".RFC 7748. Retrieved from https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748. A 2019 draft of \\"FIPS 186-5\\" confirms this claim.FIPS 186-5. Retrieved from https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/fips/186/5/draft. In 2018, DKIM specification was amended so as to allow signatures with this algorithm. Also in 2018, RFC 8446 was published as the new Transport Layer Security v1.3 standard. It requires mandatory support for X25519, Ed25519, X448, and Ed448 algorithms.

They had hoped to provide launch services for launching payloads into orbits around the Earth. This was to be realized through a method called air launch where a rocket is carried to high altitude by an aircraft and then released for launch. The rocket engine is then ignited to launch the rocket (with its payload) into a low Earth orbit (LEO). The principal advantage of a rocket being launched by a high flying airplane is that it need not fly through the low, dense atmosphere, the drag of which requires a considerable amount of extra work and thus mass of propellant. Another advantage is to precisely launch a payload into any orbital inclination at any time, and from a much wider variety of geographic launch locations.

Historical background With the imminent collapse of the German Empire at the end of the First World War in November 1918, the Kingdom of Bavaria, like all other states of the Empire, was in a state of transition from monarchy to republic. Max von Speidel, Minister of War in the Bavarian government, under orders from Kurt Eisner, tried to persuade King Ludwig on 10 November (the day before the Armistice) to issue a declaration in which he would release all officers of the Bavarian Army of their oath. Speidel however arrived at the King's residence at Schloss Wildenwart, near Rosenheim, after Ludwig had already left for Austria. Ludwig III decided to leave Bavaria temporarily for Austria, and, following an invitation of Ernst Graf von Moy, decided to take up residence at Anif Palace, near Salzburg.burgen.austria.com - Anif (in German) accessed: 14 June 2008 There, he ordered Otto Ritter von Dandl, the last prime minister of the Kingdom of Bavaria,Universit√§tsbibliothek Regensburg - Bosls bayrische Biographie - Otto Ritter von Dandl (in German) author: Karl Bosl, publisher: Pustet, page 127. to issue a declaration. Dandl demanded an abdication but the King was only willing to issue a statement absolving all officers, soldiers and government officials of the Kingdom of their oath.Verfassungsurkunde f√ºr das K√∂nigreich Bayern - Titel X.

While some, even conservative politicians, shared the government's interpretation of the declaration as an abdication, others pointed out the discrepancy between its wording and its use by the government as a declaration of abdication. Kurt Eisner had the declaration published word by word with his own below it. In his addition he states that the People's State of Bavaria () accepts the abdication of King Ludwig III and assures him and his family that they are free to return to Bavaria, like every other citizen, providing they take no steps against the people's state.Historisches lexikon Bayerns - Thronverzicht K√∂nig Ludwig III.

It is the sequel to Fight Night Round 3, released in 2006. It was released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Windows Mobile and BlackBerry. The game's featured boxers are Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson. It contains 48 licensed boxers as well as several new modes, such as Legacy mode. MarketingDemo= On May 14, 2009, a demo of the game was made available to those that had pre-ordered the game from GameStop, although it was made available for everyone to download later that month via Xbox Live or PlayStation Network. The demo features a three-round exhibition match between Ricky Hatton and Manny Pacquiao in the wake of their fight on May 2, 2009. A tutorial mode is also accessible at the beginning of the demo, which is featured in the final release. On August 27, 2009, a new updated demo was released. It now features a ten-round exhibition match between Muhammad Ali and Mike Tyson, in addition to the previous Hatton vs. Pacquiao match. It also features the return of the classic control scheme for the game where players can use the controller buttons for most controls instead of the right analog stick. This control scheme was originally in all previous Fight Night games, and it was brought into Fight Night Round 4 after fans were complaining about using the new control scheme and sufferings form clusters. =Downloadable Content= On July 27, 2009, the first piece of downloadable content for Fight Night Round 4 was released. It is free of charge, and includes a new training gym, new gameplay sliders, new equipment and an alternate version of Sugar Ray Leonard. Additional trunks, gloves and shorts were released along with face button control support in a free update at the end of August. The next piece of downloadable content, the Boxer Pack, contained Oscar De La Hoya, Vitali Klitschko and Wladimir Klitschko, as well as alternate versions of James Toney and George Foreman was released on 27 August and can be purchased through the PlayStation Store and Xbox Live Marketplace. In early December, a new pack including Bernard Hopkins, Evander Holyfield, Sonny Liston and two new modes (Old School Rules & Ring Rivalries) was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. =PlayStation Home= On July 16, 2009, EA Sports released a themed game space for Fight Night Round 4 as an expansion to the EA Sports Complex in the European and North American versions of PlayStation Home. The game space is called \\"Club Fight Night\\" and features a Club-DJ mini-game with rewards, two video screens and seating for avatars. In an update, there would be a robot boxing mini-game available to play. This space was released in the Japanese version on October 9, 2009. On November 25, 2009, two producers of Fight Night Round 4, Mike Mahar and Brian Hayes, were in the space for a live chat with the Home community. =Features= Physics based controls, Career mode is redesigned and replaced with legacy mode, players Can use photo game face to more easily put the player in the game, boxers can only block high and low, More focus on counter punching, User controlled cutman is removed and replaced with a point system, and Downloadable characters. Fight Night Round 4 Also added Flyweight and Bantamweight weight classes for the first time in a game. New boxers to the franchise allowed recreations of fights such as Ricky Hatton vs. Paulie Malignaggi, Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns and Fernando Montiel vs. Nonito Donaire. The game features 12 arenas, including Boardwalk Hall and the MGM Grand. Reception Fight Night Round 4 received \\"favorable\\" reviews on both platforms according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of three sevens and one five for a total of 26 out of 40. GameSpot's Justin Calvert praised the game's fast action and its online play. 1UP.com's David Ellis commented that the physics engine improved the gameplay, and made punches feel more realistic. Game Revolution said \\"Its incredibly accurate physics system doesn‚Äôt just set a new bar for boxing games, but for all games across all genres.\\" GameSpy's Will Tuttle noted the game's \\"stunning visuals\\", and praised the online gameplay. GamePro's Andrew Hayward thought that the gameplay flowed better as a result of the frame rate, which ran at sixty frames per second. IGN's Nate Ahearn felt that the game delivered \\"the best pure boxing ever seen in a video game.\\" Destructoid said \\"It doesn‚Äôt matter if you care about boxing; this superb game is worth a look from everybody; the game itself is a blast to play, and that‚Äôs what stands out.\\" Eurogamer described it as \\"An intense, heart-rattling experience that gets more rewarding the more time you invest in learning the nuances. With incredible attention to detail, technical achievements are more than mere eye candy and a deeper, more rewarding fighting system than ever before, it's an essential purchase for boxing fans and fighting game aficionados.\\" Criticisms were mostly focused towards the single player aspects of the game. IGN's Nate Ahearn commented that the minigames found in the legacy mode were too difficult, a sentiment echoed by GameSpy and GameSpot. Giant Bomb's Jeff Gerstmann criticized the legacy mode for being wrapped in \\"layers of unnecessary menus\\". Official Xbox Magazine said \\"Despite the uphill difficulty curve, repetitive commentary, and long loading times, Round 4 is a force that topples its mind-blowing predecessor in every category.\\" GamesTM said it was \\"A calculated and intelligent game that favours forethought and tactics over button mashing and impatience.\\" The game topped the UK sales charts for several weeks.http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/115273/EA_Titles_Dominate_UK_Charts_As_Fight_Night_Wins_Again.php Total sales exceeded 1 million units.https://mygaming.co.za/news/business/9425-these-console-games-each-sold- over-1-million-in-2010.html ReferencesExternal links * * Fight Night Round 4 Official Game Page * EA SPORTS Fight Night Round 4 Category:2009 video games Category:Boxing video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Sports video games with career mode Category:Xbox 360 games Category:EA Sports games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Canada ","title":"Fight Night Round 4"},{"id":"17935523","title":"Starrcade (1999)"},{"id":"17935560","text":"Bruce Falson (born April 17, 1975), better known by his stage name Blood Raw, is an American rapper.

Biography The brother of Geoffrey, who would later become Resident Commissioner of the Cook Islands, Nevill attended the Royal Military College of Australia from 1916 until 1919 and was appointed a lieutenant in the New Zealand Army in 1919 and held various staff and regimental appointments in New Zealand from 1921 until 1930 when he transferred to the New Zealand Permanent Air Force at its establishment on 1 April 1930. During that time he had been appointed as New Zealand Liaison Officer to the Air Ministry and he continued there until 1935. In 1937 he was appointed as Air Member for Supply to the Air Board of the newly organised Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF). As such he was responsible for all of the logistics activities of the RNZAF. As a result of this appointment he was then appointed in 1942 as Air Officer Commanding RNZAF Headquarters in London until 1943. In 1944 he was returned to New Zealand and appointed Vice Chief of Air Staff, and then in 1946 to Chief of Air Staff until January 1951. During this period his administration coped with the RNZAF at its greatest establishment of manpower, that were being, or had been, employed in most war theatres from Europe to the western Pacific, and then through a period of demobilisation when airmen were employed on many make work tasks and flying was minimised to save money. During this period, too, there were so-called strikes when airmen and other servicemen and women throughout New Zealand used \\"refusing to cooperate with orders\\" tactics to get demobilised more quickly. Most of the aircraft employed by the air force were subject to Lend Lease rules and were required to be returned to US control, or destroyed. Most were destroyed, some later than the extent of his administration. He also had to endure the effect of a home government that decided to support Britain (financially) by ordering a small fleet of pre- wartime and wartime designed aircraft, for example 100 Mosquitos, for which no useful service was contemplated. Only twelve ever flew in New Zealand and they were soon mothballed. However he was also responsible for the initiation of a series of orders for aircraft such as the Vampire, Devon, Type 170 Freighter and Hastings C Mk3 that were to see service well into the 1960s, and some beyond that. Awards In the 1946 King's Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). In the 1950 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1969 Sir Arthur was appointed an Honorary Doctor of the University of Waikato.

The relationship between structure and function, and how the regions and functions connect to each other. Different parts of the brain carrying out different tasks, interconnecting to come together allowing complex behavior. Integrative neuroscience works to fill gaps in knowledge that can largely be accomplished with data sharing, to create understanding of systems, currently being applied to simulation neuroscience: Computer Modeling of the brain that integrates functional groups together. Overview The roots of integrative neuroscience originated from the Rashevsky-Rosen school of relational biology that characterizes functional organization mathematically by abstracting away the structure (i.e., physics and chemistry). It was further expanded by Chauvet who introduced hierarchical and functional integration. Hierarchical integration is structural involving spatiotemporal dynamic continuity in Euclidean space to bring about functional organization, viz. ::Hierarchical organization + Hierarchical integration = Functional organization However, functional integration is relational and as such this requires a topology not restricted to Euclidean space, but rather occupying vector spaces This means that for any given functional organization the methods of functional analysis enable a relational organization to be mapped by the functional integration, viz. ::Functional organization + Functional integration = Relational Organization Thus hierarchical and functional integration entails a \\"neurobiology of cognitive semantics\\" where hierarchical organization is associated with the neurobiology and relational organization is associated with the cognitive semantics. Relational organization throws away the matter; \\"function dictates structure\\", hence material aspects are entailed, while in reductionism the causal nexus between structure and dynamics entails function that obviates functional integration because the causal entailment in the brain of hierarchical integration is absent from the structure. If integrative neuroscience is studied from the viewpoint of functional organization of hierarchical levels then it is defined as causal entailment in the brain of hierarchical integration. If it is studied from the viewpoint of relational organization then it is defined as semantic entailment in the brain of functional integration. It aims to present studies of functional organization of particular brain systems across scale through hierarchical integration leading to species-typical behaviors under normal and pathological states. As such, integrative neuroscience aims for a unified understanding of brain function across scale. Spivey's continuity of mind thesis extends integrative neuroscience to the domain of continuity psychology. Motivation With data building up, it ends up in its respective specializations with very little overlap. With the creation of a standardized integrated database of neuroscience data, lead to statical models that would otherwise not be possible, for example, understanding and treating psychiatric disorders. It provides a framework for linking the great diversity of specializations within contemporary neuroscience, including * Molecular neuroscience ‚Äì genetic and cellular aspects of brain function * Neuroanatomy ‚Äì connections, networks, neurotransmitter systems * Behavioral neuroscience ‚Äì the overt consequences of neural activity * Systems neuroscience ‚Äì description of sensory and motors systems * Developmental neuroscience ‚Äì structural and functional changes during maturation * Cognitive neuroscience ‚Äì channels and stages of sensory processing, including memory * Mathematical neuroscience ‚Äì quantitative simulation and emulation of neuronal and brain function * Clinical observations ‚Äì evidence that can be gleaned from brain dysfunction This diversity is inevitable, yet has arguably created a void: neglect of the primary role of the nervous system in enabling the animal to survive and prosper. Integrative neuroscience aims to fill this perceived void.  Experimental methods  Identifying different brain regions through correlation and causal methods, combine to contribute an overall brain function and location map. Using different data collected from different methods combine to create a better interconnected and integrative understanding of the brain. = Correlation = The relationship between brain states and behavioral states. Observed through spatial and temporal differences. That pin point places in the brain affected by an action or stimuli, and the timing of the response. Tools used for this include fMRI and EEG, more information below.  Functional magnetic resonance imaging  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures blood oxygen dependent response (BOLD), using magnetic resonance to observe blood oxygenated areas. Active areas are associated with increased blood flow, presenting a correlation relationship. The spatial localization of fMRI allows accurate information down to the nuclei and Brodmann areas. Certain activities such as the visual system are so rapid lasting only fractions of seconds, while other brain functions can take days or months such as memory. fMRI measures in the frame of seconds, making it difficult to measure extremely fast processes.Huettel, S. A.; Song, A. W.; McCarthy, G. (2009), Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2 ed.), Massachusetts: Sinauer,  Electroencephalography  Electroencephalography (EEG) allows you to see the electrical activity of the brain over time, can only measure presented stimuli responses, stimuli the experimenter presents. it uses electrode sensors places on the surface on the skull to measure synchronous neuron firing. It can not be certain activity is caused by stimuli only a correlation between a given function and brain area. EEG measures overall changes in wide regions, lacking specificity.Niedermeyer E.; da Silva F.L. (2004). Electroencephalography: Basic Principles, Clinical Applications, and Related Fields. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. = Causal = Brain activity is directly caused by stimulation of a specific region, as proven through experimentation.  TMS  TMS (Transcranial magnetic stimulation) uses a magnetic coil releasing a burst of magnetic field that activated activity in a specific brain area. It is useful in exciting a specific area in the cortex and recording the MEPs (Motor Evoked Potentials) that occurs as a result. It gives certain causal relationships, but is limited to the cortex making it impossible to reach any deeper than the surface of the brain.  Lesions studies  When patients have natural lesions, it is an opportunity to watch how a lesion in a given region affects functionality. Or in non-human experimentation, lesions can be created by removing sections of the brain. These methods are not reversible, unlike brain studying techniques, and does not accurately show what that section of the brain are disabled due to the disruption of homeostasis in the brain. With a permeate lesion, the brain chemically adjusted and restores homeostasis Relying on natural occurrences has little control over variables such as location and size. And in cases with damage in multiple areas, differentiation is not certain with lack of mass data.  Electrode stimulation  Cortical Stimulation Mapping, invasive brain surgery that probes at area of the cortex to relate different regions to function. Typically occurs during open brain surgery where electrodes are inserted in areas and observations are made. This method is limited by number of patients having open brain surgery that consent to such experimentation, and to what area of the brain is being operated on. Also performed in mice with full range over the brain.  Applications  Human Brain Project = Since the 'decade of the brain' there has been an explosion of insights into the brain and their application in most areas of medicine. With this explosion, the need for integration of data across studies, modalities and levels of understanding is increasingly recognized. A concrete exemplar of the value of large-scale data sharing has been provided by the Human Brain Project. = Medical = The importance of large-scale integration of brain information for new approaches to medicine has been recognized. Rather than relying mainly on symptom information, a combination of brain and gene information may ultimately be required for understanding what treatment is best suited to which individual person. = Behavioral = There is also work studying empathy and social behavior trends to better understand how empathy plays a role in behavioral science, and how the brain responds to empathy, produces empathy, and develops empathy over time. Combining these functional units and the social behavior and impact work to create a better understanding of the complex behaviors that create the human experience.

Other educational institutions range from Honolulu Community College to the KapƒÅlama Elementary school. Palama Street at , and KapƒÅlama Avenue at , are named for the neighborhood. The KapƒÅlama Stream starts at and then runs into the KapƒÅlama canal and basin. To the northwest is the neighborhood of Kalihi, and to the southeast downtown Honolulu. The Kapalama Military Reservation, constructed for logistical support in World War II was scheduled to close. A museum has been proposed in a building that served as a morgue during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. The Palama fire station at 879 North King Street was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Oahu as site 76000661 April 21, 1976, along with other Fire Stations of Oahu. It was designed in 1901 by Oliver G. Traphagen. The Kaumakapili Church was moved to 766 North King Street after the 1900 fire in Chinatown. It was originally established on April 1, 1838, as a Protestant church for common people, to supplement the Kawaiahao Church which was generally intended for nobility. From 1881 to 1888 a new brick and wood frame structure was built. Temporary services were held until the new structure was built. Ground was broken on May 7, 1910, and the new building dedicated on June 25, 1911. It is located at the southern end of Palama Street at After much damage through the years, members raised US$2.4 million for a renovation starting in 1993 of the Gothic Revival architecture building. Peter Cushman Jones established a Palama Chapel in the area in 1896. After the 1900 fire, James Arthur and Ragna Helsher Rath added social services to the center and called it Palama Settlement. The center, located at 810 North Vineyard Boulevard at Palama Street continues to offer community recreation and educational programs. The martial art of Kajukenbo was developed at the Palama Settlement.

He helped Nottingham Forest to win the FA Cup in 1898. Playing career Forman was born in Aston-on-Trent, Derbyshire, the brother of Fred Forman and uncle to Harry Linacre and all three followed a similar career path. Forman played youth football for the local village side before moving up to Beeston Town, where he was spotted by Derby County. County signed him in March 1894 but, after only making only eight appearances, he was transferred to East Midlands rivals Nottingham Forest in December 1894. By the end of his first full season with Forest he had established himself in the half-back line, generally playing on the right, alongside Scotsmen John McPherson and either Peter McCracken or Alec Stewart, as Forest finished the season in thirteenth place. By 1898, Stewart had been replaced by Willie Wragg as Forest reached the FA Cup Final for the first time, after a controversial semi-final. In the 1898 FA Cup Semi-final between Southampton and Nottingham Forest, the first match at Bramall Lane, played on 19 March, ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw. The replay at Crystal Palace was played four days later in a blizzard. After a scoreless first half (in which Joe Turner missed a penalty for Southampton), in the second half the Saints were on top when, with ten minutes left to play, referee John Lewis stopped the match for a time and the players left the pitch. No sooner had the game restarted than the weather worsened but Lewis decided that the match should continue. Southampton's goalkeeper George Clawley had his eyes \\"choked with snow\\" and conceded two goals, from Tom McInnes and Charlie Richards, in the final minutes of the game. Despite Southampton's protests the F.A. decided that the result should stand and Forest were in the final for the first time. In the final, played at Crystal Palace on 16 April 1898, Forest met Forman's old club, Derby County, who, like Forest, were making their first Cup Final appearance. Derby were favourites to win, having defeated Forest 5‚Äì0 in the league a few days earlier. Forest scored first after 19 minutes when Willie Wragg's free-kick fell to Arthur Capes whose shot gave Jack Fryer in the Derby goal little chance. County now began to exert pressure on the Forest defence and Forman, \\"who was performing splendidly at the back\\" had to clear efforts from John Goodall and Steve Bloomer. Just after the half-hour point, Derby were level after Forman gave away a free kick on the edge of the penalty area which was whipped in by Joe Leiper for Steve Bloomer to score with a header off the crossbar. Three minutes before the half-time interval, Forest were back in front after a mistake by Fryer allowed Capes a simple tap-in. Although Derby attempted to raise their game in the second half they fell further behind with four minutes left to play when John McPherson scored after John Boag failed to clear a corner, and Forest claimed the Cup with a 3‚Äì1 victory.1898 FA Cup final match report Forman's first international appearance had come shortly before the FA Cup semi-final when he was selected (together with his Forest teammate Charlie Richards) for the British Home Championship match against Ireland to be played at The Solitude Ground in Belfast on 5 March 1898. Although England were \\"expected to win with ease\\", they found the Irish tougher than expected and were fortunate to return home with a 3‚Äì2 victory, courtesy of goals from Gilbert Smith, Charlie Athersmith and Tommy Morren.Ireland 2 ‚Äì England 3; 5 March 1898 (Match summary) Forman was not selected for the match against Wales on 28 March, but was picked for the match against Scotland on 2 April, when he played alongside Charles Wreford-Brown who was making his final appearance for the national team. The match, which would decide who would win the 1898 British Home Championship, was played at Celtic Park in Glasgow. The Scots were defeated by a fast and powerful England side who ran out 3‚Äì1 winners and took the trophy, with goals from Steve Bloomer (2) and Fred Wheldon.Scotland 1 ‚Äì England 3; 2 April 1898 (Match summary) Forman was selected to play for England in all three matches in the 1899 British Home Championship. For the match against Ireland, played at Roker Park on 2 March 1899, Forman's brother Fred made his international debut. They thus became the first brothers from the same professional club to represent England at the same time, a record that stood until Manchester United's Neville brothers repeated the feat in 1996, nearly a century later. England totally dominated the Irish team and the England forwards \\"scored at will\\" with four from Gilbert Smith, three from Jimmy Settle and two each from Fred Forman and Steve Bloomer. Frank Forman also got on the score-sheet with the opening goal as England ran out victors by a 13‚Äì2 margin. This is still the record number of goals scored by England in a single match and the highest aggregate goals (15) in a game involving England. England 13 ‚Äì Ireland 2; 18 February 1899 (Match summary) Forman retained his place for the next two matches which resulted in victories over Wales (4‚Äì0) and Scotland (2‚Äì1), and thus England retained the Championship. He was not selected for the 1900 British Home Championship, his place going to Harry Johnson of Sheffield United, but he was recalled for the match against Scotland on 30 March 1901 which ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw. For the 1902 British Home Championship match against Ireland on 22 March 1902, Forman was appointed captain, with the match ending in a 1‚Äì0 victory with a late goal from Jimmy Settle.Ireland 0 ‚Äì England 1; 22 March 1902 (Match summary) He retained his place for the next match against Scotland, played at Ibrox on 5 April 1902. This match was the scene of the first Ibrox disaster when a section of the stand collapsed resulting in 25 deaths. The match was declared void by the two Football Associations and was replayed at Villa Park on 3 May, resulting in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The proceeds of the re-played match went to the disaster fund.England 2 ‚Äì Scotland 2; 3 May 1902 (Match summary) Forman's final international appearance came against Wales on 2 March 1903 in the only full international match played at Portsmouth's Fratton Park ground. The match ended in a 2‚Äì1 victory for England.England 2 ‚Äì Wales 1; 2 March 1903 (Match summary) In his international career, Forman played nine official matches and was never on the losing side, with seven victories and two draws. In the league, Nottingham Forest were regularly finishing in mid-table, with Forman missing only a small number of matches each season. During Forman's eleven seasons with the club, Forest's best League finish was fourth place gained in 1900‚Äì01, a season during which he captained the side. They did, however, have some exciting runs in the FA Cup, reaching the semi-finals in 1900, when they were eventually beaten by Bury 3‚Äì2 after extra-time in a replay, and again in 1902, when they lost 3‚Äì1 to Southampton who thus gained a measure of revenge for the controversial result of the 1898 semi-final. Forman contributed four goals in the 1902 cup run, including two against Stoke in the third round. His career at Forest continued until January 1906, with his final appearance coming in the FA Cup. He played a total of 256 matches for Nottingham Forest, scoring 28 goals in all competitions. Later career After retiring from football, he went into business as a building contractor with his nephew Harry Linacre, who had joined Forest in 1899 as a goalkeeper and played twice for England in 1905. He joined Forest's committee in 1903 until his death in 1961. He lived in West Bridgford, close to the City Ground, for the greater part of his life, and died there aged 86 on 4 December 1961.

III History When St Agnes‚Äô College (as it was originally called) was established in 1962 by the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, the school had 29 female students and three staff members, including founding Principal Sister Marcionelle (Burtille Hayes). In 1976, the school administration was handed over to laypersons when the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary transferred the school to the Sydney Archdiocese. The original building (now the administrations block) has a long history, having been granted by Governor Evans to a Rooty Hill station master, Captain Minchin, in the 1880s. In 1936, the building, dubbed \\"Fairholme\\", began use as a guest house, eventually becoming a golf clubhouse before being purchased by the Epileptic Society and, later, the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary. The school was opened to male students in 1979. 20 years later, in 1999, it was incorporated into Christ Catholic College, but separated out again in 2004 when a multi-school review determined that it and other schools bundled in Christ Catholic Church should function separately. The school maintains a Franciscan focus on simplicity, tolerance and Christianity.St. Agnes Catholic High School Student Diary, pg II Learning St Agnes teaches the same curriculum as government schools. There is however, a strong religious dimension across the curriculum which is most obvious in the subject of Religious Education. The formal Religious Education program follows the diocesan program, ‚ÄòSharing Our Story‚Äô. All students study Religious Education as part of their studies. A formal Pastoral Care program is delivered by the Personal Development, Health and Physical Education faculty as an adjunct to the PDHPE program and responds to the needs of each year group.

Two federal Nationalist MPs, Victorian William Watt and South Australian Richard Foster, joined the Liberal Party and three more MPs (John Latham from Victoria, and Malcolm Cameron and Jack Duncan-Hughes from South Australia) were elected in the 1922 federal election. South Australian Nationalist Senators James Rowell and Edward Vardon also contested the election, unsuccessfully, as Liberals.

The walk takes place in springtime every year where teams of between 4 and 7 people attempt to complete the distance in the fastest time possible while navigating their way around Cannock Chase. It is hosted by The Scout Association, for members of the Scout and Guide movements and other outdoor groups including university walking groups and even air cadets. The starting times are usually staggered between 6 am and 7 am. Before a team is allowed to walk they must have a kit check which takes place 30 minutes before their start time. Entrance fee of ¬£14 per walker applies, covering the cost of event marshalling, camping, snacks, drinks and transportation back to the start for those who retire early. Teams are tracked via GPS. Each year all finishing teams are given a cloth badge. A strict kit list must be adhered to and carried with each team for walkers to complete. This list includes items such as a first aid kit, the right boots, reflective clothing for walking during the hours of darkness, along with other safety equipment.  Trophies  Each year a trophy called the Beaudesert Trophy (formerly the Birmingham University Trophy) is awarded to the fastest team of seven whom all finish. Before 1996 the Birmingham University trophy was awarded to the fastest team with no retirements. Other trophies: * Compass Trophy \\\\- both male and female members finish. * Veterans Trophy \\\\- average age 45 or over at start and finish. Before 1996 the Veterans Trophy was awarded to the fastest team averaging 35 years or over at both start and finish.

John Jackson was baptised on 30th May 1775 (not 1778) in Lastingham, Yorkshire, and started his career as an apprentice tailor to his father, also John Jackson, who opposed the artistic ambitions of his son. John Jackson‚Äôs mother was Ann Warrener and he had at least one brother, Roger Jackson. However, John enjoyed the support of Henry Phipps, 1st Earl of Mulgrave (1755‚Äì1831), who recommended him to the Earl of Carlisle; as well as that of Sir George Beaumont, 7th Baronet, who offered him residence at his own home and ¬£50 per year. As a result, Jackson was able to attend the Royal Academy Schools, where he befriended David Wilkie and B. R. Haydon. At Castle Howard, residence of the Earl of Carlisle, he could study and copy from a large collection of paintings. His watercolours were judged to be of uncommon quality. By 1807 Jackson's reputation as a portrait painter had become established, and he made the transition to oils steadily, if not easily, regularly forwarding paintings to Somerset House. After a visit to the Netherlands and Flanders with Edmund Phipps in 1816, he accompanied Sir Francis Chantrey on a trip to Switzerland, Rome, Florence and Venice in 1819. In Rome he was elected to the Academy of St Luke. His portrait of Antonio Canova, painted on this trip, was regarded as outstanding. Jackson was a prolific portraitist, strongly showing the influence of Sir Thomas Lawrence and Henry Raeburn in his work. His sitters included the Duke of Wellington, the explorer Sir John Franklin and some noted Wesleyan ministers. His 1823 portrait of Lady Dover, wife of George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover, was widely acclaimed. He was a Royal Academy student from 9 March 1805, was elected an Associate of the RA on 6 November 1815 and elected a full member on 10 February 1817. John Jackson was married twice, the first marriage in 1808 was to Maria Frances Fletcher, the daughter of a jeweller, Samuel Fletcher. His second marriage in August 1818 was to Matilda Louisa Ward, the daughter of the painter James Ward and a niece of George Morland. He died in 1831 in St John's Wood, London. He had three children with his first wife Maria: Maria Rosa Jackson was born in 1808 and died in 1888. His son Charles Fletcher Jackson was born in 1810 and died in infancy in 1811. His second son, John Edmund Jackson was born in 1816 and again died in infancy in March 1817. John Jackson‚Äôs first wife Maria also died in March 1817 shortly before their son John Edmund died. Johns first daughter, Maria Rosa Jackson married Marmaduke Brewer and she later ran a school in Monmouthshire. Source for information about first marriage: Ancestry. Jackson had three confirmed children with Matilda. His first son, Howard William Mansfield Jackson was born in 1824. His second son with Matilda, Mulgrave Phipps Jackson (baptised Phipps Mulgrave) was born on 5 August 1830 and died on 4 October 1913. A painter himself, he exhibited in the Royal Academy for 12 years. John Jackson also had a daughter with Matilda, also called Matilda Louisa born 1825. There was also possibly a second daughter Ida Augusta Jackson, married Roeneke (27 December 1851, London ‚Äì 6 January 1874, Florence), buried in the English Cemetery, Florence.http://www.florin.ms/ChapterB.html This daughter has not yet been confirmed by Ancestry.

Built during the onset of the Great Depression. The interior was decorated in a Spanish Villa style with the walls covered with small balconies, windows and towers that gave the impression of quaint Spanish village. The ceiling was painted in an atmospheric-style (dark blue and had twinkling lights set in the plaster) to give the impression of the night sky. The Roxy was the first building in Saskatoon with air conditioning. It was built for sound pictures. The New York Roxy, largest cinema ever built in North America (demolished 1960) named after its manager noted radio personality and impresario \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel, spawned hundreds of unrelated theatres across North America named Roxy, since the word came to mean the latest and best in showmanship. Rothstein Theatres, who built the Roxy in Saskatoon, used the name in many of their locations. It is one of the last atmospheric cinemas remaining in Canada. Renamed The theatre was built by Rothstein Theatres of Winnipeg who owned it until 1974, when it was sold to Rokemay Theatres. It was leased to Odeon for a period in the 1960s and early 1970s when it was named in the Coronet. When Rokemay began operation, it was called the Towne Cinema. A second screen was added on May 30, 1980, in a separate building. The theatre was owned by Rokemay Theatres from 1974 until 2005. It was leased to and operated by Cineplex Odeon from 1986‚Äì1995. The Towne then closed in 1995, and sat vacant until purchased by Rainbow Cinemas. Restoration It was purchased and restored by Rainbow and Magic Lantern Cinemas, and reopened under its original name in 2005. It currently runs first run art/alternative movies, as well as concerts and lectures and a variety of community activities.

Dyer is best known for the long-running radio and then television quiz show, Pick a Box. At the height of his radio career, Dyer and his friend and rival, Jack Davey, were regarded as Australia's top quiz comperes.Kent, Jacqueline (1990) Out of the Bakelite Box: the Heydey of Australian Radio, Rev ed., Crows Nest, ABC Enterprises, p. 168 Bob and his wife, Dolly, were probably, after Sir Robert and Dame Pattie Menzies, the most recognised double act in Australia in the 1960s.McGinness, Mark (2004) \\"An elegant and affable sidekick: Dolly Dyer, Quiz show hostess, fisherwoman, 1921‚Äì2004 (Obituary)\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, 2005-02-15 Bob and Dolly's main interest besides performing was big- game fishing and, between them, they broke some 200 world and Australian fishing records. Early life and career Bob Dies was born in Hartsville, Tennessee,Biography - Robert Neal (Bob) Dyer - Australian Dictionary of Biography Retrieved 2018-04-27. to Heywood Leahman Dies, a sharefarmer and his wife Delia (n√©e Bell) .Jones, Barry (2006) A Thinking Reed, Crows Nest, Allen & Unwin, p. 113 In an interview much later in his life with Barry Jones, Dyer spoke of his childhood: > Back in Hartsville County my elder brother, a Negro boy and I all grew up > together. We walked to school every day and walked back home together, but > at the crossroads the Negro boy walked one way to the all-black school while > my brother and I went to the all-white school. What was the point of > separation during school hours when we were brothers for the rest of the > day? Our black friend later got into trouble and died tragically. I often > wonder what would have happened if our colours had been reversed. That is > why I have always hated racial or religious intolerance. Dyer left school at 12 and worked as \\"a dish-washer, cab driver, ice man, carpenter, milk-bar attendant, and railway freight hand\\" before taking up theatre work involving touring the United States vaudeville circuits. He first came to Australia in 1936, touring with Jim Davidson's ABC Dance Band.Kent (1990) p. 168 He returned to Sydney in 1937 as a member of the Marcus Show, doing a hillbilly and ukulele act on the Tivoli circuit, combining comedy with singing. Australian radio personality Harry Griffiths was a child at the time but met Dyer through his musician father who played first trombone for the Marcus shows. He says that \\"If Bob didn't steal the show, he came darned near it, and he was a big hit. He was a good actor, musical and full of life. He knew how to do gags, grace possible way, touring with travelling shows and doing five shows a day in the US\\".cited by Kent (1990) p. 27 Dyer then travelled to England, where he appeared on television in its early era, before returning to Australia in 1940, using the billing \\"the last of the hillbillies\\". He created, at the request of radio station 3DB (Melbourne), 26 episodes of a radio program titled The Last of the Hill Billies. In 1940, when performing at Sydney's Tivoli Theatre, he met Dolly Mack (stage name for Thelma Phoebe McLean, (1921-2004), who was a Tivoli chorus girl. He proposed nine days after their meeting, and nine days after that they were married at St John's Church, Darlinghurst. The reception was held between shows on the last day of The Crazy Show. The next day the show went to Brisbane and they spent their honeymoon in Surfers Paradise in a borrowed car. Bob and Dolly entertained Australian and American troops during World War II, performing in war zones in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Radio and television career In the 1940s and 1950s, Bob Dyer established himself as a radio star, moving onto television in the late 1950s. Dyer was known for his flamboyance.Jones (2006) p. 114 Jim Low, reviewing a CD containing Dyer's music, comedy and radio programs, comments on \\"Dyer's genuine warmth towards his contestants and his ability to milk a situation for its entertainment and comic potential\\". However, he was not a naturally funny man and so \\"plotted all the stunts he used meticulously\\". =Radio= Dyer's early radio shows were \\"stunt shows... [that] were different from the other vaudeville shows on radio at the time for, instead of a comedian or a group of people getting up in front of an audience and telling jokes, the Dyer shows depended for their fun on members of the audience themselves\\".Kent (1990) p. 26 The shows included Can You Take it? and It Pays to Be Funny. The idea for these shows came from the United States of America. Dyer was given permission by the American radio and television star, Art Linkletter, to use and adapt his scripts and stunts in Australia. People enjoyed the stunts, apparently enjoying seeing \\"their fellows put into funny and sometimes embarrassing situations ... but few 'victims' came out of the stunt shows with hard feelings; Bob Dyer was always genial and good-humoured and the prizes for doing ridiculous things were substantial\\".Kent (1990), p. 30 Dyer's shows were sponsored by Solvol, Atlantic Union Oil (for which he used the greeting \\"Happy motoring, customers\\") and Colgate-Palmolive (with the greeting \\"Happy lathering, customers\\"). In one of these he included secret sounds, such as tearing a plaster off his arm, a dog scratching fleas, or a cat lapping milk. Another, Can You Take It?, comprised \\"scrapes and dares [and was] designed to outdo a similar show by his friend and rival Jack Davey\\". Barry Jones, long time quiz contestant on Pick a Box, wrote that \\"he had a long-standing rivalry, partly genuine, partly simulated, with Jack Davey, presumably modeled on the 'feud' in the United States between Jack Benny and Fred Allen\\". Harry Griffiths says of the two that Dyer's \\"gags might have been more obvious than Jack Davey's slick humour but Bob knew what people wanted. His stuff was for the masses\\".cited by Kent (1990) p. 29 However, while Davey had the sharper wit, he \\"was essentially a radio performer who failed to make a fully successful transition to television\\". Lesley Johnson, in his biography of Jack Davey for the Australian Dictionary of Biography, writes that \\"in contrast to Dyer's carefully written scripts, Davey's spontaneity and wit, delivered in the warm, rich voice, for which he was so well known on radio, did not attract television audiences\\".Johnson, Lesley (1993) \\"Davey, John Andrew (Jack) (1907‚Äì1959)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography Australian radio personality John Pearce, who knew both Davey and Dyer, wrote in his autobiography that Dyer: > allowed the television people to tell him how it [Pick a Box] could be > transformed into the new medium, realising that TV is eighty per cent > visual, and a gesture, a piece of visible \\"business\\" is far more important > than all the clever, rapier-fast dialogue. Bob really worked at it, and he > took every piece of advice offered. Following the recording of one of his > early shows, he turned from all the people telling him how good it had been > and went to one of the cameraman. \\"I noticed you threw up your hands in > horror at something I did. Where did I go wrong?\\" He was told, and never did > it again. Davey would have been looking to have the cameraman sacked!Pearce, > John For the love of mike Some well known Australian actors, such as Bud Tingwell and John Ewart, worked as assistant comperes on Dyer's radio programs. As Tingwell had described it, the role of the assistant compere was to \\"do the big, posh Colgate-Palmolive commercials during the show as well as... the introductions\\" of Bob himself and the contestants.Charles (Bud) Tingwell Oral History Interview, interviewed by Robin Hughes, 2002-11-13 Tingwell describes this period of his life as \\"an extraordinarily generous period, working with a very, very good professional\\" noting that Dyer would release him for his film work and use a temporary assistant until he returned. =Pick a Box= In 1948, when he was also compering Winner Take All and Cop The Lot, Dyer launched the quiz show Pick a Box on radio. He toned down his hillbilly twang and \\"replaced his yellow boots and loud checks with a respectable suit, tie and glasses\\". In 1957, Pick a Box made its television debut. It was first sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive and later by British Petroleum (BP). It was the first big quiz show on national television. Dyer's catch-cry on the show, \\"the money or the box\\", was a familiar phrase in AustraliaLow, Jim (2003) \\"Bob Dyer: Pick a Box Hillbilly Heaven\\", Simply Australia Reviews, Issue 9 decades after the show ended. \\"Howdy, customers, howdy\\" and \\"Tell them Bob sent you\\" were other well-known Dyer catch-cries. Honours  In 1969 Dyer believed that the show was losing its popularity and two years later, in 1971, he and Dolly decided to retire. In June 1971, a few weeks before the last Pick a Box was screened, Bob and Dolly both appeared in the Queen's Birthday Honours list. Bob, still a US citizen, was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE),It's an Honour: Robert Neil Dyer while Dolly was appointed a Member of the Order (MBE).Australian Dictionary of Biography: Robert Neal Dyer At the ceremony, the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, who was \\"not generally known for his humour, asked Bob if he wanted to take the medal or the box it was in\\". Dyer also won two Gold Logie Awards, one in 1960 and, in 1971, a special Gold Logie to him and Dolly to mark their contribution to the industry over 15 years. =First television simulcast= Early in 1957, ATN began simulcasting eight radio shows from the Macquarie Auditorium. These included two by Bob Dyer, It Pays to Be Funny and Pick A Box. Within a year only Pick A Box was still on the air.Moran, Albert (1991) \\"Some beginnings for Australian television: the first Governor-General\\", Continuum: The Australian Journal of Media & Culture, 4 (2) It was simulcast for five years.By contrast, Jack Davey started simulcasting three programs in 1957, but the television versions were cancelled about a year later. (Johnson, Australian Dictionary of Biography) Big-game fishing On retirement Bob and Dolly moved to the Isle of Capri in Queensland's Gold Coast and took up seriously what had previously been a hobby, big-game fishing for such fish as marlin. Between them, they broke 50 world and 150 Australian records. Death In the late 1970s, Bob and Dolly sold their house and moved to a high-rise apartment. Bob developed Alzheimer's diseaseJones (2006) p. 127 and became reclusive until his death in 1984. Dolly died almost twenty one years later, on Christmas Day 2004.

Approximate finite-dimensionality was first defined and described combinatorially by Ola Bratteli. Later, George A. Elliott gave a complete classification of AF algebras using the K0 functor whose range consists of ordered abelian groups with sufficiently nice order structure. The classification theorem for AF-algebras serves as a prototype for classification results for larger classes of separable simple nuclear stably finite C*-algebras. Its proof divides into two parts. The invariant here is K0 with its natural order structure; this is a functor. First, one proves existence: a homomorphism between invariants must lift to a *-homomorphism of algebras. Second, one shows uniqueness: the lift must be unique up to approximate unitary equivalence. Classification then follows from what is known as the intertwining argument. For unital AF algebras, both existence and uniqueness follow from the fact the Murray-von Neumann semigroup of projections in an AF algebra is cancellative. The counterpart of simple AF C*-algebras in the von Neumann algebra world are the hyperfinite factors, which were classified by Connes and Haagerup. In the context of noncommutative geometry and topology, AF C*-algebras are noncommutative generalizations of C0(X), where X is a totally disconnected metrizable space.  Definition and basic properties  Finite-dimensional C*-algebras = An arbitrary finite-dimensional C*-algebra A takes the following form, up to isomorphism: : \\\\oplus _k M_{n_k}, where Mi denotes the full matrix algebra of i √ó i matrices. Up to unitary equivalence, a unital *-homomorphism Œ¶ : Mi ‚Üí Mj is necessarily of the form :\\\\Phi (a) = a \\\\otimes I_r, where r¬∑i = j. The number r is said to be the multiplicity of Œ¶. In general, a unital homomorphism between finite- dimensional C*-algebras :\\\\Phi: \\\\oplus _1 ^s M_{n_k} \\\\rightarrow \\\\oplus _1 ^t M_{m_l} is specified, up to unitary equivalence, by a t √ó s matrix of partial multiplicities (rl k) satisfying, for all l :\\\\sum_k r_{l k} n_k = m_l.\\\\; In the non-unital case, the equality is replaced by ‚â§. Graphically, Œ¶, equivalently (rl k), can be represented by its Bratteli diagram. The Bratteli diagram is a directed graph with nodes corresponding to each nk and ml and the number of arrows from nk to ml is the partial multiplicity rlk. Consider the category whose objects are isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional C*-algebras and whose morphisms are *-homomorphisms modulo unitary equivalence. By the above discussion, the objects can be viewed as vectors with entries in N and morphisms are the partial multiplicity matrices. = AF algebras = A C*-algebra is AF if it is the direct limit of a sequence of finite-dimensional C*-algebras: : A = \\\\varinjlim \\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow A_i \\\\, \\\\stackrel{\\\\alpha_i}{\\\\rightarrow} A_{i+1} \\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots , where each Ai is a finite-dimensional C*-algebra and the connecting maps Œ±i are *-homomorphisms. We will assume that each Œ±i is unital. The inductive system specifying an AF algebra is not unique. One can always drop to a subsequence. Suppressing the connecting maps, A can also be written as :A = \\\\overline {\\\\cup_n A_n}. The Bratteli diagram of A is formed by the Bratteli diagrams of {Œ±i} in the obvious way. For instance, the Pascal triangle, with the nodes connected by appropriate downward arrows, is the Bratteli diagram of an AF algebra. A Bratteli diagram of the CAR algebra is given on the right. The two arrows between nodes means each connecting map is an embedding of multiplicity 2. :1\\\\rightrightarrows2\\\\rightrightarrows4\\\\rightrightarrows8\\\\rightrightarrows\\\\dots :(A Bratteli diagram of the CAR algebra) If an AF algebra A = (‚à™nAn)‚àí, then an ideal J in A takes the form ‚à™n (J ‚à© An)‚àí. In particular, J is itself an AF algebra. Given a Bratteli diagram of A and some subset S of nodes, the subdiagram generated by S gives inductive system that specifies an ideal of A. In fact, every ideal arises in this way. Due to the presence of matrix units in the inductive sequence, AF algebras have the following local characterization: a C*-algebra A is AF if and only if A is separable and any finite subset of A is \\"almost contained\\" in some finite-dimensional C*-subalgebra. The projections in ‚à™nAn in fact form an approximate unit of A. It is clear that the extension of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra by another finite-dimensional C*-algebra is again finite-dimensional. More generally, the extension of an AF algebra by another AF algebra is again AF.Lawrence G. Brown. Extensions of AF Algebras: The Projection Lifting Problem. Operator Algebras and Applications, Proceedings of symposia in pure mathematics, vol. 38, Part 1, pp. 175-176, American Mathematical Soc., 1982  Classification  K0 = The K-theoretic group K0 is an invariant of C*-algebras. It has its origins in topological K-theory and serves as the range of a kind of \\"dimension function.\\" For an AF algebra A, K0(A) can be defined as follows. Let Mn(A) be the C*-algebra of n √ó n matrices whose entries are elements of A. Mn(A) can be embedded into Mn + 1(A) canonically, into the \\"upper left corner\\". Consider the algebraic direct limit : M _\\\\infty (A) = \\\\varinjlim \\\\cdots \\\\rightarrow M_n(A) \\\\rightarrow M_{n+1}(A) \\\\rightarrow \\\\cdots . Denote the projections (self-adjoint idempotents) in this algebra by P(A). Two elements p and q are said to be Murray-von Neumann equivalent, denoted by p ~ q, if p = vv* and q = v*v for some partial isometry v in M‚àû(A). It is clear that ~ is an equivalence relation. Define a binary operation + on the set of equivalences P(A)/~ by :[p] + [q] = [p \\\\oplus q] where ‚äï is the orthogonal direct sum. This makes P(A)/~ a semigroup that has the cancellation property. We denote this semigroup by K0(A)+. Performing the Grothendieck group construction gives an abelian group, which is K0(A). K0(A) carries a natural order structure: we say [p] ‚â§ [q] if p is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to a subprojection of q. This makes K0(A) an ordered group whose positive cone is K0(A)+. For example, for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra : A = \\\\oplus _{k = 1} ^m M_{n_k}, one has : (K_0(A), K_0(A)^+) = (\\\\mathbb{Z}^m, \\\\mathbb{Z}_+ ^m). Two essential features of the mapping A K0(A) are: #K0 is a (covariant) functor. A *-homomorphism Œ± : A ‚Üí B between AF algebras induces a group homomorphism Œ±* : K0(A) ‚Üí K0(B). In particular, when A and B are both finite- dimensional, Œ±* can be identified with the partial multiplicities matrix of Œ±. #K0 respects direct limits. If A = ‚à™nŒ±n(An)‚àí, then K0(A) is the direct limit ‚à™nŒ±n*(K0(An)). = The dimension group = Since M‚àû(M‚àû(A)) is isomorphic to M‚àû(A), K0 can only distinguish AF algebras up to stable isomorphism. For example, M2 and M4 are not isomorphic but stably isomorphic; K0(M2) = K0(M4) = Z. A finer invariant is needed to detect isomorphism classes. For an AF algebra A, we define the scale of K0(A), denoted by Œì(A), to be the subset whose elements are represented by projections in A: :\\\\Gamma(A) = \\\\\\\\{ [p] \\\\,\\\\, p^* = p^2 = p \\\\in A \\\\\\\\} . When A is unital with unit 1A, the K0 element [1A] is the maximal element of Œì(A) and in fact, :\\\\Gamma(A) = \\\\\\\\{x \\\\in K_0(A)\\\\,\\\\, 0 \\\\leq x \\\\leq [1_A]\\\\\\\\}. The triple (K0, K0+, Œì(A)) is called the dimension group of A. If A = Ms, its dimension group is (Z, Z+, {1, 2,..., s}). A group homomorphism between dimension group is said to be contractive if it is scale- preserving. Two dimension group are said to be isomorphic if there exists a contractive group isomorphism between them. The dimension group retains the essential properties of K0: #A *-homomorphism Œ± : A ‚Üí B between AF algebras in fact induces a contractive group homomorphism Œ±* on the dimension groups. When A and B are both finite-dimensional, corresponding to each partial multiplicities matrix œà, there is a unique, up to unitary equivalence, *-homomorphism Œ± : A ‚Üí B such that Œ±* = œà. #If A = ‚à™nŒ±n(An)‚àí, then the dimension group of A is the direct limit of those of An. = Elliott's theorem = Commutative diagrams for Elliott's theorem. Elliott's theorem says that the dimension group is a complete invariant of AF algebras: two AF algebras A and B are isomorphic if and only if their dimension groups are isomorphic. Two preliminary facts are needed before one can sketch a proof of Elliott's theorem. The first one summarizes the above discussion on finite-dimensional C*-algebras. Lemma For two finite-dimensional C*-algebras A and B, and a contractive homomorphism œà: K0(A) ‚Üí K0(B), there exists a *-homomorphism œÜ: A ‚Üí B such that œÜ* = œà, and œÜ is unique up to unitary equivalence. The lemma can be extended to the case where B is AF. A map œà on the level of K0 can be \\"moved back\\", on the level of algebras, to some finite stage in the inductive system. Lemma Let A be finite-dimensional and B AF, B = (‚à™nBn)‚àí. Let Œ≤m be the canonical homomorphism of Bm into B. Then for any a contractive homomorphism œà: K0(A) ‚Üí K0(B), there exists a *-homomorphism œÜ: A ‚Üí Bm such that Œ≤m* œÜ* = œà, and œÜ is unique up to unitary equivalence in B. The proof of the lemma is based on the simple observation that K0(A) is finitely generated and, since K0 respects direct limits, K0(B) = ‚à™n Œ≤n* K0 (Bn). Theorem (Elliott) Two AF algebras A and B are isomorphic if and only if their dimension groups (K0(A), K0+(A), Œì(A)) and (K0(B), K0+(B), Œì(B)) are isomorphic. The crux of the proof has become known as Elliott's intertwining argument. Given an isomorphism between dimension groups, one constructs a diagram of commuting triangles between the direct systems of A and B by applying the second lemma. We sketch the proof for the non-trivial part of the theorem, corresponding to the sequence of commutative diagrams on the right. Let Œ¶: (K0(A), K0+(A), Œì(A)) ‚Üí (K0(B), K0+(B), Œì(B)) be a dimension group isomorphism. #Consider the composition of maps Œ¶ Œ±1* : K0(A1) ‚Üí K0(B). By the previous lemma, there exists B1 and a *-homomorphism œÜ1: A1 ‚Üí B1 such that the first diagram on the right commutes. #Same argument applied to Œ≤1* Œ¶‚àí1 shows that the second diagram commutes for some A2. #Comparing diagrams 1 and 2 gives diagram 3. #Using the property of the direct limit and moving A2 further down if necessary, we obtain diagram 4, a commutative triangle on the level of K0. #For finite-dimensional algebras, two *-homomorphisms induces the same map on K0 if and only if they are unitary equivalent. So, by composing œà1 with a unitary conjugation if needed, we have a commutative triangle on the level of algebras. #By induction, we have a diagram of commuting triangles as indicated in the last diagram. The map œÜ: A ‚Üí B is the direct limit of the sequence {œÜn}. Let œà: B ‚Üí A is the direct limit of the sequence {œàn}. It is clear that œÜ and œà are mutual inverses. Therefore, A and B are isomorphic. left Furthermore, on the level of K0, the adjacent diagram commutates for each k. By uniqueness of direct limit of maps, œÜ* = Œ¶. =The Effros-Handelman-Shen theorem= The dimension group of an AF algebra is a Riesz group. The Effros- Handelman-Shen theorem says the converse is true. Every Riesz group, with a given scale, arises as the dimension group of some AF algebra. This specifies the range of the classifying functor K0 for AF-algebras and completes the classification.  Riesz groups  A group G with a partial order is called an ordered group. The set G+ of elements ‚â• 0 is called the positive cone of G. One says that G is unperforated if k¬∑g ‚àà G+ implies g ‚àà G+. The following property is called the Riesz decomposition property: if x, yi ‚â• 0 and x ‚â§ ‚àë yi, then there exists xi ‚â• 0 such that x = ‚àë xi, and xi ‚â§ yi for each i. A Riesz group (G, G+) is an ordered group that is unperforated and has the Riesz decomposition property. It is clear that if A is finite-dimensional, (K0, K0+) is a Riesz group, where Zk is given entrywise order. The two properties of Riesz groups are preserved by direct limits, assuming the order structure on the direct limit comes from those in the inductive system. So (K0, K0+) is a Riesz group for an AF algebra A. A key step towards the Effros- Handelman-Shen theorem is the fact that every Riesz group is the direct limit of Zk 's, each with the canonical order structure. This hinges on the following technical lemma, sometimes referred to as the Shen criterion in the literature. The Shen criterion. Lemma Let (G, G+) be a Riesz group, œï: (Zk, Zk+) ‚Üí (G, G+) be a positive homomorphism. Then there exists maps œÉ and œà, as indicated in the adjacent diagram, such that ker(œÉ) = ker(œï). Corollary Every Riesz group (G, G+) can be expressed as a direct limit :(G, G^+) = \\\\varinjlim (\\\\mathbb{Z}^{n_k}, \\\\mathbb{Z}^{n_k}_+) , where all the connecting homomorphisms in the directed system on the right hand side are positive.  The theorem  Theorem If (G, G+) is a countable Riesz group with scale Œì(G), then there exists an AF algebra A such that (K0, K0+, Œì(A)) = (G, G+, Œì(G)). In particular, if Œì(G) = [0, uG] with maximal element uG, then A is unital with [1A] = [uG]. Consider first the special case where Œì(G) = [0, uG] with maximal element uG. Suppose :(G, G^+) = \\\\varinjlim (H_k, H_k^+) , \\\\quad \\\\mbox{where} \\\\quad (H, H_k^+) = (\\\\mathbb{Z}^{n_k}, \\\\mathbb{Z}^{n_k}_+). Dropping to a subsequence if necessary, let :\\\\Gamma(H_1) = \\\\\\\\{ v \\\\in H_1^+  \\\\phi_1(v) \\\\in \\\\Gamma(G) \\\\\\\\}, where œÜ1(u1) = uG for some element u1. Now consider the order ideal G1 generated by u1. Because each H1 has the canonical order structure, G1 is a direct sum of Z 's (with the number of copies possible less than that in H1). So this gives a finite-dimensional algebra A1 whose dimension group is (G1 G1+, [0, u1]). Next move u1 forward by defining u2 = œÜ12(u1). Again u2 determines a finite-dimensional algebra A2. There is a corresponding homomorphism Œ±12 such that Œ±12* = œÜ12. Induction gives a directed system :A = \\\\varinjlim A_k , whose K0 is : \\\\varinjlim (G_k, G_k^+), with scale :\\\\cup_k \\\\phi_k [0, u_k] = [0, u_G]. This proves the special case. A similar argument applies in general. Observe that the scale is by definition a directed set. If Œì(G) = {vk}, one can choose uk ‚àà Œì(G) such that uk ‚â• v1 ... vk. The same argument as above proves the theorem.  Examples  By definition, uniformly hyperfinite algebras are AF and unital. Their dimension groups are the subgroups of Q. For example, for the 2 √ó 2 matrices M2, K0(M2) is the group of rational numbers of the form a/2 for a in Z. The scale is Œì(M2) = {0, ¬Ω, 1}. For the CAR algebra A, K0(A) is the group of dyadic rationals with scale K0(A) ‚à© [0, 1], with 1 = [1A]. All such groups are simple, in a sense appropriate for ordered groups. Thus UHF algebras are simple C*-algebras. In general, the groups which are not dense in Q are the dimension groups of Mk for some k. Commutative C*-algebras, which were characterized by Gelfand, are AF precisely when the spectrum is totally disconnected.Davidson 1996, p. 77. The continuous functions C(X) on the Cantor set X is one such example.  Elliott's classification program  It was proposed by Elliott that other classes of C*-algebras may be classifiable by K-theoretic invariants. For a C*-algebra A, the Elliott invariant is defined to be :\\\\mbox{Ell}(A) \\\\; \\\\stackrel{\\\\mbox{def}}{=}\\\\; (\\\\; (K_0(A), K_0(A)^+, \\\\Gamma(A) ), K_1(A), T^+(A), \\\\rho_A \\\\;), where T+(A) is the tracial positive linear functionals in the weak-* topology, and œÅA is the natural pairing between T+(A) and K0(A). The original conjecture by Elliott stated that the Elliott invariant classifies simple unital separable nuclear C*-algebras. In the literature, one can find several conjectures of this kind with corresponding modified/refined Elliott invariants.  Von Neumann algebras  In a related context, an approximately finite-dimensional, or hyperfinite, von Neumann algebra is one with a separable predual and contains a weakly dense AF C*-algebra. Murray and von Neumann showed that, up to isomorphism, there exists a unique hyperfinite type II1 factor. Connes obtained the analogous result for the II‚àû factor. Powers exhibited a family of non-isomorphic type III hyperfinite factors with cardinality of the continuum. Today we have a complete classification of hyperfinite factors.

Norin remained in Scandinavia, working for ASA Film company in such movies as De Tre, m√•ske fire, Nordhavets m√¶nd and with Max Hansen in Wienerbarnet. With her Swedish background, she also made several films in Sweden. In 1942, Norin stated that she would only do films and, preferably, only with Danish director Bodil Ipsen. Norin's finest performance came in Ipsen's 1944 crime thriller Mordets Melodi, in which Norin played a cabaret singer suspected of serial murder. The film is cited as a classic in Denmark and considered the first Danish film noir thriller. Norin made only three more films, ending with 1947's Mani. After her brief career, she withdrew from public performance, later stating simply, \\"I didn't want to anymore.\\" The Danish film critic Morten Piil wrote that Norin's acting created a \\"different female type with figures filled with tragic undertones and vague suffering.\\" Personal life Norin married film and television director S√∏ren Melson in 1940. They remained married until his death in 1984. Norin died on 27 November 1997. She is buried in Mariebjerg Cemetery in Gentofte.

It is part of the Town of Cape Vincent, in Jefferson County. History Originally held by the Iroquois, one of the first Europeans to take notice of the island was Pierre Fran√ßois Xavier de Charlevoix, in 1720. He called it Isle aux Chevreuils, the Island of Roe Bucks, and wrote in 1721 that its bays could be useful.History of Cape Vincent A 1779 map of the Province of New York indicates that the island was at one time called Isle a la Biche.The Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal Vol. 3, July 1879, p. 41 Retrieved 2020-07-19 It was also referred to as Buck Island or Deere Island.Fort Haldimand Retrieved November 17, 2016Fort Haldimand History Retrieved November 19, 2016 The island was renamed Carleton Island after Major General Sir Guy Carleton, Governor of the Province of Quebec. It was one of several islands in the area that were named by John Graves Simcoe after General James Wolfe's adjutants in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. The largest is Wolfe island, while the others are Howe Island, Amherst Island, and Gage Island (now Simcoe Island). During the American Revolutionary War the British used the island as a military supply transshipment location, naval station, and for building ships. Fort Haldimand was built to defend the station and shipyard.Mika, Nick and Helma et al. Kingston, Historic City. Belleville: Mika Publishing Co., 1987. p. 18 The island also served as a base for raids against American towns and Loyalists used the island as a refuge to escape rebel persecution. After the war the island was ceded to the Americans. The island is now used mainly for recreation and tourism purposes. Map of Carleton Island, 1810 =Naval base and Fort Haldimand= After the fall of New France at the end of the Seven Years' War, maintaining inland water routes in the Great Lakes for the purpose of commerce and transportation was important to the British. With the outbreak of rebellion against the British which led to the American Revolutionary War, it became especially important to secure supply lines and military supremacy on Lake Ontario. And so the construction of a naval station became necessary. To this end, in 1778, Governor Frederick Haldimand ordered a survey to determine the best location. The former French post at Cataraqui (the present day Kingston, Ontario) and Buck Island (later renamed Carleton Island) were considered, but Buck Island was chosen because it was deemed more defensible. The island became a transshipment point for supplies, became the main base for British ships on Lake Ontario, and the construction of the fort was started (but never completed).Mika, Nick and Helma et al.

Belleville: Mika Publishing Co., 1987. p.179 Fort Haldimand, initially called Fort Carleton,New York State Military Museum and Veterans Research Center Retrieved November 18, 2016 was strategically important as well as a centre of shipbuilding. The fort was built in 1778 and named after British General Frederick Haldimand.

The ruins of the fort can still be seen at the southwest end of the island along northeast side of North Bay.

During the War of 1812, Carleton Island was captured without bloodshed by three freelancing Americans, though it was already nominally American territory due to the Jay Treaty. In 1817, the State Legislature of New York annexed the island to Jefferson County, and granted of its land to the local New York postmaster, Charles Smyth. The island had been a haven for smugglers, and later that year a Canadian tax collector seized some tobacco from the island. This dispute escalated, and Governor DeWitt Clinton of New York threatened hostilities. Soon Secretary of State John Quincy Adams was called upon to sort out the matter.Memoirs of John Quincy Adams: Comprising Portions of His Diary from 1795 to 1848, pp 394‚Äì399 After contentious negotiations, the island was retained by the United States and was turned over to peaceful pursuits of farming (now abandoned), sport-fishing, and summer tourism.John A.

In the battle, Jovan Nenad was defeated by a much larger force, and many of his troops dispersed into Syrmia after the defeat. When Ferdinand of Austria won, the Serbs maintained an autonomous principality in the area that lasted until 1540. Background In 1525, the Serbs of Vojvodina (who had previously ruled the area as Hungarian vassals) saw the power vacuum created by the struggle for the Hungarian throne, and decided to elevate their status from autonomous principality to full-fledged state. At first, the rebels supported J√°nos Szapolyai; however, soon the Hungarian king demanded of Jovan Nenad that he relinquish control of the land. The Serbian response was a switch to the side of Ferdinand. Jovan Nenad and his numerically inferior forces defeated two larger Hungarian forces (the first was the force led by Laszlo Casky and the second was at the Battle of Sz≈ël≈ës). After the Sz≈ël≈ësian battle, Jovan proclaimed himself the tsar of Voivodina. The Hungarian peasants and noblemen governance by the priests and teachers took up arms against the Serbs and Szapolyai direct bishop of Imre Czibak by restoration of order. Few Serbian soldiers still stood by Szapolyai, mainly the Lipovian Serbs. The battle The Serbian rebels faced the entire combined strength of Transylvania and upper Hungary. They met the Hungarians at Sz≈ëdfalva, near Szeged, and were defeated. The army at a slow place demoralized and remained will be 8,000 men of Jovan. The Transylvanian army numbered 12,000‚Äì13,000 men with the peasants, rebels, and Romanians. However, Jovan Nenad was able to recoup his losses and reform his army after the defeat. Jovan fled to Szeged, and came upon the house of merchant Istv√°n Z√°k√°ny. A soldier Sebesty√©n Vid shot Jovan with muskets. Jovan fell mortally wounded, and his men dropped at Tornjo≈°. B√°lint T√∂r√∂k become aware of that, and left Tornjo≈°, where Jovan was killed. Jovan's head was sent to Szapolyai. Aftermath Jovan Nenad, who managed to recoup his losses at Sedfal field, was later killed en route to a battle against the forces of the Hungarian king. His forces dispersed after his death and the area was given to the Serbian despots who ruled an autonomous principality subordinate to the Hungarian king. The Serbs came back into the Ottoman Empire and took up their duties in the Ottoman army. Serbian soldiers fought in the Siege of Vienna in 1529.

Hoidge continued downing enemy aircraft until 31 October 1917, when his total stood at 27. During this stretch of success, his most memorable battle was one in which he did not score. He was one of the seven aces involved in Werner Voss's last stand on 23 September, when Voss in his Fokker F.I fought all the British fliers to a standstill, damaging all the attacking SE 5s. Hoidge's final total included 23 successes over enemy fighters and only five over opposing two-seater reconnaissance planes. His 28-claim tally comprised eight destroyed (including a shared victory), and 20 'out of control' victories (including two shared).Over the Trenches; Shores, 1990, page 197 Later life Hoidge was returned to England for a year's duty as an instructor.

Mordialloc also played in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) from 1958 until 1988. History The club is based in the Melbourne suburb of Mordialloc and started out in the Federal Football Association. They played in the FFA from 1909 to 1957 and were premiers on seven occasions - 1923, 1924, 1929, 1939, 1950, 1951 & 1952\\\\. Since 1927, the club has played at Ben Kavanagh Reserve in McDonald St, Mordialloc, a ground which is notable for its long length & similar size playing area as the MCG. In 1958 they joined the Victorian Football Association. The club was initially allocated to Division 1 when the Association was first divided into two divisions, but was relegated to Division 2 after finishing last in 1962, and spent most of its remaining time in the Association in the lower division. Mordialloc lost the 1965 Grand Final to Preston and made another second division Grand Final in 1976 but lost again, this time to Williamstown. The following season the club broke through for their first VFA premiership with a 38-point win over Yarraville, under the leadership of captain-coach Geoff Rosenow. As a result of the premiership, Mordialloc was promoted to Division 1, but lasted only one season before being relegated. Mordialloc's time in the VFA ended three matches into the 1988 season when they resigned due to poor onfield performances and the uncertain future of the VFA's second division. The club then joined the South East Suburban Football League, now known as the Southern Football League, where it has played since.

Though born in Canada, Soden moved to the United Kingdom as a child. He served initially in the British Army as an infantry officer, before joining the Royal Flying Corps and transferring to the Royal Air Force on its creation. He remained in the RAF following the war, and went on to serve in Iraq and also as an RAF Station commander during the Second World War. Early life and World War I service Soden was born in Petitcodiac, New Brunswick, Canada, but emigrated to England as a child in 1904. He was educated at Woodbridge School. His career in the armed forces began with the Inns of Court Regiment Officer Training Corps, from which he was commissioned into the South Staffordshire Regiment as second lieutenant in 1914. He first entered a theatre of war on 14 July 1915. He was first attached to the Royal Flying Corps in 1916, and officially transferred on 27 April 1917. His career as a fighter ace began in No. 60 Squadron RFC, when flying a Nieuport 17 to claim an Albatros D.III down 'out of control' on 25 June 1917. Beginning with his third victory on 17 September 1917, he was flying the new Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a. He was not credited with the destruction of an enemy aircraft until his fourth claim, on 20 September. He became an ace with the first of two victories the morning of 21 September 1917, sending down an Albatros DV out of control. In the afternoon, he was credited with the destruction of a second enemy craft, shared with two other 60 Squadron pilots. He was given command of a flight on 5 December 1917, and given temporary promotion to captain. He accumulated victories at a steady pace, downing from one to four Germans per month through February 1918. He achieved his most notable victory on 9 January 1918, over Max, Ritter von M√ºller. M√ºller, whose victory tally was 36, had downed no fewer than five British aces. Accompanied by Captain Robert Chidlaw-Roberts, Soden set M√ºller's Albatros D.V on fire in the air near Moorslede, Belgium. M√ºller exited the flaming biplane and fell to his death. On 5 February, Soden scored a double, bringing his total to 16. On 8 August he was a flight commander with No 41 Squadron, still flying the S.E.5a. He sent a Fokker D.VII down in flames, and scored twice more in August. On 15 September, he singlehandedly shot down an observation balloon for his 20th kill. In October 1918, he scored his greatest month. On the 8th he destroyed a DFW C. two-seater, and on the 10th he flamed a Fokker D.VII. On the 14th, he destroyed two more D.VIIs. On the 25th, he again shot down a balloon. On the 28th, he was responsible for the capture of a Fokker D.VII near Ooteghem, Belgium. His 27th and final victory came three days later, when he drove down another D.VII out of control. Soden's final tally included 13 German aircraft put down 'out of control', 11 destroyed, 2 observation balloons destroyed single-handed, and a Fokker D.VII captured.

During his 19-year reign, Thalun successfully rebuilt the war-torn country which had been under constant warfare for nearly a century since the 1530s. Thalun instituted many administrative reforms and rebuilt the economy of the kingdom. In 1608, Anaukpetlun captured Prome and made Thalun the governor of Prome. In 1628, Anaukpetlun was murdered by his own son Minyedeippa who made himself king. Thalun was then on his campaigns against the Shans at Kengtung with his brother Minye Kyawswa II, the governor of Ava. However, the death of Anaukpetlun forced the two to return to Pegu to claim the throne from the unlawful king and to counter the opportunistic Arakanese invasions. Thalun became the center of rallying against Minyedaikpa and was proclaimed the crown prince. In 1629, Thalun and Minye Kyawswa were able to take Pegu and executed Minyedeippa.Rajanubhab, D., 2001, Our Wars With the Burmese, Bangkok: White Lotus Co. Ltd., At Pegu, there was an assassination attempt by a Mon on King Thalun, which resulted in the massacre of the Mons. Thalun fought a three-year campaign against Lanna, finally subjugating them in 1632. In 1634, Thalun moved the capital to Ava and crowned himself king of Ava and made his brother Minye Kyawswa crown prince, Maha Uparaja. Thalun then concentrated on building pagodas and other works of merit. However, Minye Kyawswa died on 28 August 1648. Thalun then made his own son Pindale as the crown prince. The son of Minye Kyawswa who wanted the crown prince title for himself staged a rebellion. The palace was sacked and Thalun fled to Sagaing. However, the rebellion was soon put down and the conspirators were burnt alive. Thalun died on 19 October 1648, succeeded by his son Pindale. NotesReferences   External links * .

He was born in Nagoya from a humble background,Boxer, Charles. R. (1951). The Christian Century in Japan, p. 273. and he was a Christian.Jansen, Marius B. (1992). He played an important role in the handling of \\"Nanban trade\\" in Nagasaki with Christian powers, and led an invasion to Taiwan, before being executed for his Christian faith. Career in Nagasaki Murayama went to Nagasaki as a youth and was baptized there, receiving the name \\"Antonio\\". He was highly successful in various commercial ventures and became very rich. He also became a famous amateur of European food (ÂçóËõÆÊñôÁêÜ, \\"Nanban-Ryori\\", lit. \\"Southern Barbarian Cuisine\\") Murayama became very influential in Nagasaki, and was nominated as delegate from the municipal council to Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1592. Hideyoshi took a liking to him, and even changed his first name to \\"T≈çan\\" because he could not pronounce \\"Antonio\\" easily. Hideyoshi nominated Murayama as the local tax farmer. Murayama had very close connections with the Jesuits. He had one of his sons, Francisco, ordinated as parish priest of Nagasaki in 1602.Boxer, p. 274. A Japanese Red seal ship. Tokyo Naval Science Museum. In 1603-1604 Murayama became Magistrate of Nagasaki in place of Terazawa Hirotaka, following disputes on the price of the silk being provided by the Portuguese. Murayama managed to regulate the silk trade with the Portuguese through the introduction of the \\"bulk-purchase\\" pancada system (ito-wappu for the Japanese). Murayama and his colleague Hasegawa Sahioye Fujihiro got into various disputes with the Jesuits and started accusing them of pride and arrogance, of abusive extraterritorial powers in Nagasaki, and of concealing the best silks from Ieyasu. Murayama advocated for the development of direct trading relations between Japan and China, and for the expansion of the Red seal ship system to carry the silk trade.Boxer, p. 275. Taiwan expedition In 1616, Murayama T≈çan was directed by the Tokugawa Shogunate to invade Taiwan.Taiwan Government This followed a first exploratory mission by Arima Harunobu in 1609. The objective was to establish a base for the direct supply of silk from China, instead of having to supply it from Portuguese-controlled Macao or Spanish-controlled Manila.Boxer, p. 298. Murayama had a fleet of 13 ships and around 4,000 men, under the command of one of his sons. They left Nagasaki on 15 May 1616. The invasion attempt ended in failure however. A typhoon dispersed the fleet and put an early end to the invasion effort.Japan's Southward Advance and Australia - Page 34 by Henry P. Frei 1991: \\"...ordered the Governor of Nagasaki, Murayama Toan, to invade Formosa with a fleet of thirteen vessels and around 4000 men. Only a hurricane thwarted this effort and forced their early return\\" The king of Ryukyu Sho Nei had warned Ming China of the Japanese intentions to capture the island and to use it as a trading base with China, but in any case only one ship managed to reach the island and it was repelled by local forces.Recent Trends in Scholarship on the History of Ryukyu‚Äôs Relations with China and Japan Gregory Smits, Pennsylvania State University, p.13 The single ship was ambushed in a Formosan creek, and all her crew committed suicide (\\"seppuku\\") to avoid capture. Several ships diverted themselves to plunder the Chinese coast and are reported \\"to have killed above 1,200 Chinese, and taken all the barkes or junks they met withal, throwing the people overboard\\". Death In 1618 Murayama T≈çan got into a dispute with the Japanese Christian trader Suetsugu Heizo (Êú´Ê¨°Âπ≥Ëîµ). Toan first accused Heizo of concealing Jesuits despite the official interdiction, and Heizo accused him of having killed 17 or 18 Japanese from a family who resisted giving him a bride.Boxer, p. 333. Heizo apostatized and at the same time accused Murayama of harbouring Spanish priests and his own clerical sons. Murayama T≈çan was finally found to be guilty by the Bakufu and executed in 1619 along with most of his family. Murayama Toan's eldest son was Murayama Tokuan Andres.

It is the parish church of the Thorndon Catholic parish (founded 1850) and the Cathedral of the Archbishop of Wellington. The New Zealand Parliament is a close neighbour of the Cathedral. However, the Thorndon Catholic parish predates that institution. The Cathedral is part of a Catholic precinct which includes St Mary's College; Sacred Heart Cathedral School; St Mary's Convent, the motherhouse of the Sisters of Mercy in Wellington; the Catholic Centre, in which Catholic administration is located; and Viard House, which is both the Cathedral parish presbytery and the residence of the Archbishop. The church was popularly known as \\"the Basilica\\", because of its palladian architectural style.In Roman Catholic ecclesiastical terms, Sacred Heart Cathedral is not a minor basilica. See: List of minor basilicas in the world. It was designated as the Cathedral of Wellington in 1984 after earthquake strengthening and the addition of the Blessed Sacrament chapel, foyer, sacristy, courtyard, hall (called Connolly Hall) and piazza. The parish of Thorndon was administered by the Society of Mary (Marist Fathers) for eighty-five years until 1935, although secular or diocesan clergy were also stationed there. The founder of the see, Bishop Viard, and the first two Archbishops, Redwood and O'Shea, were also members of the Society of Mary. Since 1954 all the archbishops and the resident clergy of the Cathedral have been secular clergy. Thorndon has always been the residence of the archbishops of Wellington except for the period 1935‚Äì1954 when Archbishop O'Shea continued to live at Paterson St, Mt Victoria which was his address as coadjutor. On 13 July 2018, the main Cathedral building was closed for seismic strengthening, with services continuing in the cathedral chapel or at St Thomas Moore Church, Wilton.Tom Hunt, \\"Wellington's Sacred Heart Cathedral closes after being deemed a significant quake risk\\", Stuff News, 14 July 2018 (Retrieved 18 July 2018)The Cathedral Connection, Vol 8 Issue 28, 4 August 2019, p. 3. The strengthening of the cathedral is expected to be completed in 2023 to a high standard with base isolation. Sacraments The normal Mass times are: * Weekdays: 8.00am and 12.10pm * Saturday: 8.30am and (Anticipated Mass for Sunday) 5.30 pm * Sunday: 10.30am (choral) and 7.00pm. On or near 8 December each year (the feast of the Immaculate Conception) there is celebrated a special Mass to renew the 1855 consecration of Wellington to Our Lady under that title and to protect the city from earthquakes.\\"Service times\\", Sacred Heart Cathedral (Retrieved 26 November 2014) Because of the closure of the cathedral for seismic strengthening, the 5.30pm Saturday and the 10.30am Sunday Masses are celebrated at St Thomas More Church. The weekday Masses, the 8.30am Saturday Mass and the 7.00pm Sunday Mass are celebrated in the Blessed Sacrament chapel of the Cathedral. MusicChoral= Sacred Heart Cathedral has a strong music tradition.\\"Music at the Cathedral\\", Sacred Heart Cathedral (Retrieved 26 November 2014) There are two instrumental (piano, guitars, organ) and vocal ensembles to lead congregational hymn- singing for at least one Sunday Mass each week.Programme Notes, Noel: A concert of Advent and Christmas music, Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington, 5 December 2012. There are two traditional choirs. The Cathedral choir is made up of a dedicated group of trained singers. This choir sings on most Sundays at the Cathedral at the 10.30am Mass as well as at concerts and special services. While firmly based on Gregorian chant, the choir sings (accompanied by one of the organs or the Cathedral Orchestra when that is appropriate) a wide repertoire ranging from Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, Thomas Tallis and William Byrd to George Frideric Handel, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Anton Bruckner, Gabriel Faur√©, Herbert Howells, Maurice Durufl√©, Ildebrando Pizzetti, Morten Lauridsen, James MacMillan, Douglas Mews, Eric Whitacre, Ola Gjeilo and many other composers including occasional commissioned contemporary works. The boys' choir is made up of about 15 boys from the neighbouring Sacred Heart Cathedral School. Each boy receives a scholarship which pays for weekly individual vocal tuition and theory lessons. The boys sing an occasional Choral Mass during school term. The Cathedral Grand Organ is situated in the choir loft and the console in the whispering gallery. It was designed and built by Arthur Hobday in 1905 and has been revised and enlarged since with the changing needs of the cathedral. Sacred Heart Cathedral is also a well- used concert venue (500 people can be seated\\"Ministries\\", Sacred Heart Cathedral (Retrieved 26 November 2014)) for outside orchestras and performance groups because of the building's size and its fine \\"warm\\" acoustics.John Button, Dominion-Post, 6 October 2014 (Retrieved 23 November 2014) =Historic ceremonies= showing the pre-Vatican II ordering The Cathedral choir plays a prominent role in liturgical ceremonies in the Cathedral. Its role in two important state funerals and an episcopal anniversary was of particular note. Sir Joseph Ward, the 17th Prime Minister of New Zealand, died in July 1930.Michael Bassett, Sir Joseph Ward: A political biography, Auckland University Press, 1993, pp. 283 and 284. Ward had prayed daily in the Basilica (or its predecessor, St Mary's Cathedral ‚Äì see below) for all of his thirty- seven years as a member of the New Zealand Parliament. The Requiem Mass was celebrated on 9 July by Bishop O'Shea (then Coadjutor Archbishop of Wellington), and Archbishop Redwood, the 1st Archbishop of Wellington, delivered the panagyric. In the words of The New Zealand Herald, \\"unbent beneath the weight of his 91 years ... in his scarlet vestment, [Archbishop Redwood] was a commanding and impressive figure.\\" After the Mass, Ward's casket lay in the Basilica where a steady stream of people came and went during the day. It was then transferred across the road to Parliament Buildings by his colleagues and family before being transported to Bluff where the interment took place. Michael Joseph Savage, the 23rd, and 1st Labour, Prime Minister of New Zealand, died on 27 March 1940.Barry Gustafson, From the Cradle to the Grave: A biography of Michael Joseph Savage, Reed Methuen, Auckland, 1986, p. 271. His funeral gave the Cathedral choir a chance to achieve national recognition, as it was broadcast nationally. The organist was Miss Josephine Mulligan whose contributions included Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Marche Funebre at the commencement.\\"State Obesquies for Prime Minister\\", The Weekly News, 4 April 1940. The choir consisted of male voices conducted by Rev Father FH Walsh. The Dominion thought that \\"it was appropriate because of the interest of the late Prime Minister in young people that boys figured largely in the singing of the Mass\\" which was entirely sung in plain song.\\"Basilica Male Voice Choir under Father F H Walsh DD\\", The Dominion, 29 March 1940. The crowd was so great in the church ‚Äì even the organist needed an official invitation ‚Äì that the boys in the choir were forced to sing from the chancel galleries high above the altar. The solemn requiem was celebrated by Archbishop O'Shea who in his sermon preached that Savage's life \\"was a rebuke to all who would seek to advance their interests, whether personal or class, at the expense of social amity and concord\\" and that Savage would \\"not leave a single enemy among decent men.\\"Andrea O'Neil, \\"Thousands mourn state 'father'\\", The Dominion Post, 22 September 2015, p. A4. Savage's remains were transported to Auckland in a rail journey much interrupted by crowds of mourners along the way. After resting briefly in St Patrick's Cathedral, he was buried at Bastion Point (where the Savage Memorial was eventually constructed).Earnest Simmons, The Story of St Patrick's, Catholic Diocese of Auckland(?), Auckland, 1985, p. 20. Another great choir occasion occurred earlier, in 1934, for the 60th episcopal anniversary of Archbishop Redwood himself, when \\"the special music of the Mass was rendered by the Basilica choir of fifty voices under the conductorship of Miss Eileen Dennehy. Miss Josephine Mulligan was at the organ. The music of the Mass was as follows: 'Ecce Sacerdos' (Elgar), Edouard Silas' Mass in C, 'O Sacrum Convivium', and 'Jubilate Deo' ... the plain song was sung by the male voices of the choir, under the baton of Rev. Father Feehly.\\"\\"Pictorial Record & Narrative of the Episcopal Jubilee\\" Catholic News, Wellington, May 1934, quoted by Dan Kelly, p. 129 Basilica The first church to be built on the Hill Street site was the wooden, neo-Gothic, St Mary's Cathedral, blessed and opened in 1851. It was gutted by fire on 28 November 1898, during repainting. It was decided that a new cathedral should be erected near Mt Victoria and a parish church built on the site of the old cathedral. However, the new church, called the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, was intended as a substantial building. Its foundation stone was laid in 1899 and the building blessed and opened two years later. The money to build Sacred Heart was partly taken from the fund for the new cathedral; the new cathedral was never actually built. It was not until 1984 that the Basilica was elevated to the status of a cathedral, and on 18 March 1984 the Cathedral was consecrated by Cardinal Thomas Williams, the fifth Archbishop of Wellington. In 1985, the building was listed as a Category 1 Historic Place.New Zealand Historic Places Trust, Sacred Heart Cathedral, Wellington (Retrieved 17 August 2014) Ionic capital and entablature The Cathedral is largely built of Oamaru limestone with brick facings. Designed by architect Francis Petre, with an axis of east-west rather than the west-east of its predecessor, Sacred Heart was built on a classical basilican plan. However, its portico of Ionic columns of Oamaru stone, whose pedestals rest on elongated plinths, and a high pediment closely reflect those of a Roman or Greek temple, and, in that respect, its most obvious model is the Maison Carr√©e, Nimes, which has full-length, Corinthian, columns. The building is within the classical proportions and forms a parallelogram (accommodating a clerestory with rows of arch-topped windows) of about 42 metres by 19 metres by a height of 18 metres. The main entrance is reached by means of a flight of seven steps. Out of the portico are three pairs of folding doors. The main pair in the centre give entrance directly to the church (originally, through a vestibule).Dan Kelly, p. 83, quoting The Tablet, 7 February 1901. The frieze of the Cathedral pediment carries the Latin inscription in gold letters: S.S. Cordi Jesu Dedicatum. A.D. MCMI which may be translated as \\"Dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A.D. 1901.\\" The interior features a main aisle and two side aisles, a large arcaded nave and a large arch forming the entrance to the sanctuary. Walls are built in a succession of arches surmounted by a cornice of stone which forms part of the roof. Series of stone pilasters are ranged against the walls and on the sides of piers. The pilasters in the sanctuary form, with two free-standing columns supporting the cornice, a pleasing assemblage. Their capitals all continue the Ionic theme of the portico. To strengthen the building against earthquakes, concrete piers and steel beams were incorporated in the fabric of the building in 1983. The Blessed Sacrament chapel, the foyer entrance and the adjoining Connolly Hall were added to the Cathedral in 1984. They are mainly constructed in concrete.Metropolitan Cathedral of the Sacred Heart and St Mary His Mother, Hill St, Thorndon, Wellington: A Short Guide, Sacred Heart Cathedral Parish, Thorndon, 2011(?) At the same time a large square or piazza was constructed at the east end of the Cathedral and this is used for processions and gathering space, especially on Palm Sunday, during Holy Week, and at Easter for the Service of the light and the candle-lit procession before the Easter Vigil Mass. For a period Sacred Heart looked even more palladian when it had twin bell towers topped with domes.Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand: Photograph of the Cathedral showing bell towers. (Retrieved 23 November 2014) These towers (not designed by Francis Petre) were incorporated in the original design but were removed in 1942, following an earthquake. Features Interior (2005) with baptismal font in cross-aisle (approximate site of tomb of Bishop Viard is to the left of the font); painting and emblem of the Sacred Heart in the sanctuary =Sacred Heart= The Sanctuary is dominated by a large painting of the Sacred Heart of Jesus by Enrico Refto above the Cathedra of the Archbishop. At the top of the westernmost arch of the Cathedral, above the Sanctuary, is a large, sculpted, Oamaru stone emblem of the Sacred Heart. =Pulpit= The beautiful and ample pulpit just outside the sanctuary beside the northern aisle is still in use. It was installed in 1908 to commemorate the first parish priest of the new Basilica, Father W J Lewis SM, who died in 1907. He had been parish priest when the Basilica was being built. The pulpit was paid for by his fellow priests and records their sorrow at his demise. There was a memorial plaque which listed the details of Father Lewis' life on the adjoining pillar. This was removed to make way for one of the memorial crosses which signify the consecration of the church in 1984. The plaque may now be found at the top of the southern aisle of the Cathedral . The names of all the Bishops and Archbishops in Wellington have recently been inscribed on the panels of the pulpit although the original dedication by the priests to the memory of Father Lewis remains recorded at the base of the structure. =Viard memorial= Latin memorial tablet for Bishop Viard originally placed in St Mary's Cathedral. Translation: On a pier beside the South Aisle are three memorial tablets (one in English and two in Latin) relating to Bishop Viard, the first Bishop of Wellington, who died in 1872 and is buried in the Cathedral. He was originally buried in the old St Mary's Cathedral in a brick vault at the foot of Our Lady's Altar. His tomb in the present Cathedral is approximately on the Hill St side of the baptismal font at the cross-aisle (see photograph to the right). Four years later, the first parish priest of Thorndon, Father Jean Baptist Petitjean, who had arrived in Wellington with Bishop Viard in 1850, died in front of the same altar at the tomb of his bishop. Father Petitjean is also commemorated in Sacred Heart.\\"Catholic pioneers: Fr Jean-Baptiste Petitjean\\", Catholic Archdiocese of Wellington (Retrieved 23 November 2014) =Chapel= The Blessed Sacrament Chapel, built to the north, at right angles to the main axis of the building, can accommodate about 60 worshippers. The chapel houses five examples of fine English Victorian stained glass from the studios of the Atkinson Brothers given by the parish of St Joseph, Mt Victoria. They were first placed in the original, octagonal, St Joseph's church in Buckle St in 1885.Jack Duggan, St Joseph's Parish, Te Aro and Mount Victoria, 1885-2007: A Perspective on Our Parish History and Catholic Faith, St Joseph's Parish, Mount Victoria, 2007, pp. 89 and 377. The central window is decorated with abstract designs. The other windows are of saints, two on each side. The saints are (on the left) Patrick and John and (on the right) Francis Xavier (with the notable astronomer Father David Francis Kennedy SM memorialised on this window) and, on the far right, St Peter. The windows \\" ... are a unique collection as no other building in the world contains more than two from these same workshops.\\" The modern glass above the chapel doors was designed and fabricated by Graham Stewart of Christchurch. There is also a fine icon of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and St Mary his mother by contemporary iconographer Michael Galovic (installed in 2007).\\"Sacred Heart Cathedral: An oasis of peace open daily\\", Sacred Heart Parish, 2012. Statue of Blessed Virgin Mary in the cloister courtyard; windows of Blessed Sacrament Chapel In the west wall of the chapel is a small space or ambry where the holy oils (called Chrism) are kept. The ambry is backed by a panel with a gold sculptured image of Christ on it. This panel was a door, once part of the tabernacle of the High Altar of old St Mary's Cathedral. The front of the ambry has a wide red and yellow, glass, mosaic border (created by Con Kiernan) around the glassed-in space where can be seen the three glass, amphora-like, chrismaria containing the holy oils. These vessels and their contents are bathed in a somber green light. =Mary, mother of Jesus= In the cloister courtyard beside the foyer entrance of the Cathedral stands the two-metre, cast-iron statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary, made in France (\\"with heavy Gilt\\" ) that was lodged, in honour of the Immaculate Conception on 8 September 1867, high up on the east side of the tower of the original cathedral, St Mary's Cathedral, where it faced the harbour and its gilding reflected \\"the first rays of the rising sun.\\" The statue was placed in the tower in memory of the consecration of the diocese in 1855 to the Immaculate Conception, which Bishop Viard had carried out, after he had proclaimed the newly pronounced dogma, as a specific remedy against any recurrence of the series of severe earthquakes felt in the province of Wellington over several months in that year. South aisle and window; to the right, a station of the cross with a \\"Mater Dolorosa\\" sculpture below it The statue fell some 80 feet during the 1898 fire, crashing down from the tower. However it was later salvaged with minor damage. Some eyewitnesses attested that when the Cathedral tower fell, the statue hung momentarily in mid air before descending slowly and gracefully and in an upright position to the ground where it landed completely undamaged.see: Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch describing a similar event in Christchurch 112 years later. In 1984 the statue of Mary, now painted white except for the crown and girdle, was placed in the cloister courtyard to remain \\"the sign and warrant of her protection of the city.\\" =Sculptures= Inside the Cathedral at the entrance are small statues of the Four Evangelists. These originally stood under the first High Altar of the present cathedral. Near the sanctuary is a statue of St Brigid, patron of St Brigid's Church, Wadestown, which was closed in 2007. Behind the cathedra in the sanctuary is a bronze and enamelled Processional Cross designed and made by Graham Stewart for the visit of Pope John Paul II to Wellington in 1986. The sanctuary contains some important mosaics. Beneath the Stations of the Cross is a set of fourteen bronzes, Mater Dolorosa, designed by Wellington sculptor, Eve Black, depicting Mary's sorrow as she witnessed her son's journey to the Cross and Grave. =Taonga= Steps to the piazza and entrance of the Cathedral (carved pou above the cross); Catholic Centre (including the office of the Archbishop of Wellington) at the rear Amongst the treasures of the Cathedral are a kohatu whakairo (thinking stone ‚Äì a carved rock of Oamaru stone) situated inside the Cathedral entrance and a pou (a carved wooden pole) in the piazza in front of the Cathedral. The taonga were gifts from Catholic MƒÅori of the Archdiocese and were installed in 1989.\\"Unique gift to cathedral\\", Zealandia, 22 January 1989, p. 1. They were carved by Porirua master carver Lou Kereopa. The kohato whakairo consists of several layers as follows. At the base, the solid foundation represents the faith given by Jesus Christ; above that, the essentials of that faith are then shown in panels on each of the four sides of the stone (the seven sacraments, the Ten Commandments, the crucified Saviour within the Holy Trinity, and the fourth panel is the cathedral itself represented by the initials \\"J\\" and \\"M\\" for Jesus and Mary with two hearts). The next layer shows on each panel four figures representing four aspects of faith from none to the full believing Christian (whose face is full on with a full moko). Together these four figures support the suffering world over which stands the church bearing Christ's light to the nations. This light is represented by a globe which is the world encircled by a crown of thorns representing human suffering and disobedience, and the sacrifice of Jesus who gave his life that human beings may live and have eternal life. The structure is crowned by a church portraying the shelter and joyful hope that the gospel offers. The cross surmounting the kohatu whakairo symbolises all who follow the way of Jesus.\\"Kohatu Whakairo (Thinking Stone)\\", Metropolitan Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, 2018, pp. 2 and 3. Strengthening and fund-raising Sacred Heart Cathedral was closed on Friday 13 July 2018, after the discovery that its structural integrity was 15 per cent of the standard for a new building and that it was therefore a significant risk to occupants in the event of an earthquake. The building must be strengthened to at least 33 percent of the New Building Standard (NBS) before it is reopened. The strengthening of the cathedral is expected to be completed in 2023 to a high standard (100% of the NBS) with base isolation.Kate Green, \\"$8.5m to strengthen cathedral\\", 'The Dominion Post', 24 July 2020, p. 5.

Campaign for Liberty focuses on educating elected officials and the general public about constitutional issues, and currently provides a membership program. Its legal status is that of a 501(c)(4) nonprofit. The Campaign for Liberty was announced on June 12, 2008, as a way of continuing the grassroots support involved in Ron Paul's 2008 presidential run, and corresponded with the suspension of that campaign. Paul formally announced during the Texas Republican Convention that he had created this new organization known as the \\"Campaign for Liberty\\". On August 5, 2015, C4L Chairman John Tate was indicted by a federal grand jury for felony charges arising from an alleged cover-up Tate, and colleagues on the 2012 Ron Paul presidential campaign, conducted to conceal the expenditure of campaign money to buy the endorsement of an Iowa politician. In October 2015, Tate was acquitted of all charges. Purpose According to Ron Paul, the purpose of the Campaign for Liberty is to continue the principles that invoked the grassroots support of his campaign, and to also be able to continue the message that he promoted during the course of his bid, without having a presidential campaign, and is also intended to \\"lay the groundwork for a different America.\\" Paul also noted,Ron Paul's Goal: 100,000 By September. Marc Ambinder, Atlantic Monthly, June 13, 2008. It was also established as a reporting agency for news involved with the principles of the organization. Political advocacy Audit the Federal Reserve= A C4L member shows support for HR 1207 at a local gathering Campaign for Liberty's first major policy initiative involves pushing support for HR 1207, a bill that calls for more transparency of the Federal Reserve. Also called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, HR 1207 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives of the 111th United States Congress by Campaign For Liberty's Honorary Chairman, Congressman Ron Paul (TX-14). The bill proposed a full audit of the Federal Reserve System (the \\"Fed\\") before the end of 2010. As of May 25, 2010, it had 319 cosponsors and has been referred to the Committee on Financial Services. The bill was reintroduced in the 112th Congress by Congressman Ron Paul. The Federal Reserve Transparency Act passed the House of Representatives on July 25, 2012, by a margin of 327-98. At the time of passage, the bill had 274 co-sponsors. Harry Reid refused to bring the Senate version, S.202, introduced by Senator Rand Paul, up for a vote. H.R 24, \\"Ron Paul's Audit the Fed\\" was introduced in the House on January 3, 2013 by Congressman Paul Broun of Georgia. As of April 15, 2013, the bill has 142 co- sponsors. An identical bill, S.209, was introduced in the Senate by Senator Rand Paul. As of April 15, 2013, the bill has 24 co-sponsors. =Internet freedom= Campaign for Liberty has lobbied against CISPA and SOPA/PIPA.

According to the Rally's official website, its purpose was to \\"be a celebration of our movement and our supporters, a launch party for the Campaign for Liberty, and a clear call to the Republican Party to return to its roots of limited government, personal responsibility, and protection of our natural rights. The event ran in conjunction with the first two days of the Republican National Convention and featured top conservative speakers, musicians, and organizations.

In 681, part of the Bulgars settled in the Balkan peninsula and established Bulgaria. The main source of information used for reconstruction of the Bulgar calendar is a short 15th century transcript in Church Slavonic called Nominalia of the Bulgarian Khans, which contains 10 pairs of calendar terms. Additionally, the same dating system is used in a marginal note in a manuscript by 10th century monk Tudor Doksov and in the Chatalar inscription by the 9th-century Bulgarian ruler Omurtag (r. 814-831), who also provides the Byzantine imperial dating equivalent (the indiction). According to the reconstructed calendar, the Bulgars used a 12-year cyclic calendar similar to the one adopted by Turkic peoples from the Chinese calendar, with names and numbers that are deciphered as in Bulgar language. –û–±—Ä–∞–∑—É–≤–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∞—Ç–∞ –¥—ä—Ä–∂–∞–≤–∞. –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ü–µ—Ç—ä—Ä –ü–µ—Ç—Ä–æ–≤ (–ò–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ù–∞—É–∫–∞ –∏ –∏–∑–∫—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 1981) —Å—Ç—Ä. 171. The reading, along with the \\"cyclic calendar\\" interpretation itself, was originally proposed by Finnish Slavist Jooseppi Julius Mikkola in 1913. Later, there have been various modifications and elaborations during the 20th century by scholars such as G√©za Feh√©r, Omeljan Pritsak, Mosko Moskov and other scientists.Zlatarski, Vasil. 1918. Istoriya na balgarskata darzhava prez srednite vekove. Balgarsko letobroene (in Bulgarian). Peter Dobrev, who supports an \\"Iranian\\" fringe theory about the origin of the Bulgars,According to Prof. Raymond Detrez, who is a specialist in Bulgarian history and language, such views are based on anti-Turkish sentiments and in serious scholarly circles it is well known that the Bulgar language was a Turkic one: Developing cultural identity in the Balkans: convergence vs divergence, Raymond Detrez, Pieter Plas, Peter Lang, 2005, , p. 29.However the linguistic impact of the Iranian world on the Turkic Bulgars is indisputable.

Career in Asia Born in Middelburg, Putmans came to Asia in 1621 in the service of the Dutch East India Company. Over the first three years of his career, he was stationed in Siam, Cambodia, Patani, Sumatra's west coast and Java's north east coast. In 1624, he came to Batavia; four years later he became the president of the college of Aldermen and the overseer of the Chinese citizens.Bluss√©, van Opstal and Ts'ao Yung-Ho, De Dagregisters van het Kasteel Zeelandia, Taiwan, I, 1629-1641 (The Hague 1986), 2n6 Governor of Formosa Fort Zeelandia, the seat of the governor of Formosa and his Council, as it would have appeared around 1635. Drawing by Johannes Vingboons, in all likelihood based on an earlier drawing by David de Solemne. In 1629, he became the fourth governor of Formosa, present-day Taiwan. In 1633, he led a military campaign on the Chinese coast against the Chinese admiral Zheng Zhilong. In addition to Dutch vessels, Putmans commanded a great number of Chinese pirate vessels which he hired for the campaign. In July of that year, in a surprise attack near the island of Gulangyu, near Xiamen, he managed to destroy the fleet that Zheng Zhilong was building there. On 22 October, however, Putmans' fleet was defeated at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, where Zheng Zhilong destroyed three Dutch East Indiamen with fireships and captured another, putting the remainder of the Dutch fleet to flight.Tonio Andrade, Lost Colony: the untold story of China‚Äôs first great victory over the West (Princeton 2011), ch. 3 and 4. Defeated in the battle, Putmans turned his attention to agriculture, establishing a policy of attracting settlers from the Chinese mainland to Formosa, in order to cultivate rice and sugar on the fertile plains on the west side of the island. In time, this policy would become very successful.Tonio Andrade, How Taiwan became Chinese: Dutch, Spanish, and Han Colonization in the Seventeenth Century, ch. 6.

Basic Books, . He ended his career as a colonel general and a Hero of the Soviet Union. Early life and career Born in Gori (then under the Russian Empire), Inauri was a worker until volunteering, in 1926, in the Red Army and graduated from a Cavalry School for the North Caucasian Mountainous Nationalities in Krasnodar in 1931. From April 1931, he commanded a cavalry platoon and then a squadron of the 16th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Cavalry Division of the Ukrainian Military District. He became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1932. From October 1936, Inauri was put in charge of the regimental schools for the same division, later in 1938 as assistant commander for the commanding officer. Before the outbreak of war, Inauri commanded the same division's 99th Cavalry Regiment as a major in the Kiev Special Military District. World War II From June 1941 to January 1942, Lieutenant Colonel Inauri led the 99th Cavalry Regiment into combat. The cavalrymen under his command excelled in mid-January 1942 during the Second Battle of Kharkov, which led to another promotion on May 6 of the same year. From August 1942 to the end of the war, Inauri commanded the 1st Cavalry Division of the 15th Cavalry Corps, Transcaucasus Front, stationed in Iran. Due to outstanding performance, Inauri was promoted to Major General by the resolution of the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR. Post war Inauri continued service as a commander of a cavalry division till 1946. In 1948 he graduated from the Voroshilov General Staff Academy and took charge of the 18th Mechanized Division as part of the Soviet occupation forces in Germany. In 1951 he commanded the 9th Rifle Division and in February 1953 he took command over the 3rd Mountain Rifle Corps of the Carpathian Military District. In 1954, Inauri was made head of the Georgian KGB, a post that he retained until 1986. Later in 1957, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. His tenure coincided with a series of upheavals, including the 1956 uprising, and rise of anti-Soviet dissident groups in Georgia to which Inauri was able to respond vigorously due largely to a strict discipline imposed by him within the KGB and a large web of espionage through which Inauri's agents infiltrated dissident groups and even the Georgian Orthodox Church. He played a key role in a palace coup against Nikita Khrushchev in October 1964, escorting the Soviet leader from his datcha at Pitsunda to a special meeting of the Presidium of the Central Committee in Moscow where Khrushchev was to be ousted. Inauri was promoted to the rank of Colonel-General in 1967 and awarded the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union in 1985, shortly before his retirement later in 1986.Knight, Amy W.

The Noble Company was founded circa 1350 in the town of Alfaro (Castile, La Rioja, Spain). Membership in the Noble Company has always been considered a \\"positive act of nobility,\\" creating or confirming the Knights Crossbowmen as hidalgos with \\"nobility of blood and arms.\\" The crossbow as a military and hunting weapon was already known by the Romans. After a relative dark period it came to have a preeminent place in the 11th century in European armories (consider its importance in the Hundred Years War) and for hunting wild game.  Noble Confraternity and weapons  Medieval sources provide us the types of arrows they threw, with different uses and meanings‚Äîeven stone bullets capable of getting through armor from a distance longer than 250 feet. It was used by knights and infantrymen near the end of the 12th century, specially in Southern Europe. In land and sea, in sieges, actions and battles, its victims have no number (note - King Richard of the House of Plantagenet's killing in 1199). In spite of the presence of such an effective weapon during medieval campaigns, the Catholic Church condemned its use between Christians in wars: already in 1097-1099 Pope Urban II had condemned it, and the 1139 Concile in Laterano confirmed its prohibition.  Kingdom of Navarre  In the Kingdom of Navarre documental references to crossbowmen are very old. In the summer of 1280, after a serious dispute between the towns of Alfaro and Corella (regarding water sharing of the Alhama River), Corella residents while harvesting their fields, being afraid of the Alfarians. were protected by at least thirty five crossbowmen. They were paid for serving thirty days the amount of 2093 Pounds. That service was very appreciated, and distinguished with tax exemptions and even with nobiliary privileges. In 1362 Miguel S√°nchez de Urs√∫a, lord of Urs√∫a, served as master of crossbowmen. In 1355 Infante Don Luis ordered the governor of Estella to repair the town ballisters, which were mentioned in 1438. Nowadays there are still several crossbow companies such as the Crossbowmen companies of San Vicente de la Sonsierra, San Mill√°n (√Ålava) and Pe√±acerrada (that of √Åvalos lasted until the 19th century and that of Marqu√≠nez (√Ålava) were rebuilt as the brotherhood of the Sacred Sacrament of Noble Crossbowmen.  Kingdom of Castilla and Leon  In the kingdoms of Castilla and Le√≥n the first notices about crossbowmen came from the reigns of Alfonso VIII and Alfonso IX, growing during the 13th century as an auxiliary corporation as well as military bodyguard regiments (as police or justices). Although since the days of King Don Sancho IV there appeared the office of lord crossbowman; it was during the reigns of Don Alfonso XI and Don Pedro I that the royal crossbowmen reached a significant rank in Court, having the offices of lord crossbowman and lord major crossbowman. These titles were kept at least until the end of 15th century, when there were several lord major crossbowmen, foot crossbowmen and horse crossbowmen.  King's Crossbowmen  During the 14th and 15th centuries are notices referring to the King's crossbowmen spreading into towns and villages and recruiting their inhabitants ‚Äî a frustrated attempt to establish a territorial Militia and Police Corps. Additionally, special attention was given to the crossbow troop of Madrid, and even more to the one hundred and fifty crossbowmen of Sevilla, who attained great privileges (headed by their Lieutenant Juan de Monsalve). This group had an important part in the conquest of Canary Islands in 1480 and in the Granada Campaign ten years later. After the Medieval Era, the troops served the Crown under the authority of a lord crossbowman. The Noble Company of Knights Crossbowmen of Saint Philip and Saint James was founded in the 14th century. During this period, the land was owned by the Kingdom of Navarre (Alfaro was a highly powerful fortress in front of Castilla):Alfaro was attacked by the pretendant Don Enrique de Trastamara's troops in 1367, by Infante Don Juan of Castilla in 1378, and later in 1430 by Pedro Fern√°ndez de Velasco, master steward of Don Juan II of Castilla). Although in those three times the castle remained, in the first and in the third the town was burned by Castilians. During that time there were maintained a company of noble crossbowmen whose privileges were recognized and confirmed by the courts of Castilla. Protectors of the Confraternity Although The Noble Company has always enjoyed the earthly Patronage and Protection of the Spanish Crown‚Äîand still does today‚ÄîThe Noble Company receives its divine protection and guidance from the Apostles, Saint Philip and Saint James the Less, whose feast day is in May. That and other ceremonies in June and November are celebrated in the church of Saint Francis. The Noble Company was ruled by a major, a steward and a secretary; the two first were yearly elected during the day of Saint John of Avila on May 10. The major was the lawful authority in charge of everything in relation to fees, punishments and penalties. In this matter he was compared to an ordinary major in that time and he was like a true Royal Justice. The steward was in charge of economic and administration services of the Company. He managed the organization of ceremonies and reunions. He was also in charge of the surveillance of the communal fields. This work was of great importance. The secretary, a secondary charge, managed only the Noble Company books and documents. The crossbowmen were noblemen and had to be married to ladies of equal rank. To belong to the Noble Company was proof of nobility. All knights were obligated to assist in the corporative and municipal ceremonies and to guard the communal fields. The Confraternity in the 21st century Although the Noble Company has had a continuous existence since its inception in the 14th century‚Äîas confirmed by several governmental, notarial, and archdiocesan records‚Äîthe Noble Company was officially registered with the Gobierno de Rioja in 1999; its revised, modernized statutes were approved in April 2004. Under the command of the President-Alcaide, Don Alfonso Ceballos-Escalera y Gila, Marqu√©s de La Floresta, the Noble Company keeps the military tradition. Knights are obliged to acquire skill enough to manage his weapon each time they meet, especially every time they meet to pray. Each member is also expected to pledge fealty to the President-Alcaide by sending him a good bottle of wine at Christmas. There are two classes of membership: Ballestero de Plaza and Ballestero de Hermandad. The former is reserved for residents of Rioja and its environs while the latter is for all others. As noted on the petition for admission, all members must be Catholic men who are: (a) at least twenty (20) years of age, (b) armigerous (with their arms duly registered in Spain), (c) possess nobility in the male line, and (d) if married, they are validly so (according to the Catholic Church) to women of good breeding. By virtue of their admission, members of the Noble Company receive the honorific Don for themselves and their male descendants (who will inherit and transmit the member's armorial bearings). The members' wives and female descendants are referred to as Do√±a. Economic life of the Noble Company depends on the members‚Äô passage (initiation) fees. Today members of the Confraternity are present in Spain, the UK, the USA, Germany, and Italy. =Major Officers of the Confraternity= * Royal Protector and Honorary Chief: SM Don Juan Carlos I of Spain * Chief: SAR the Prince Alvaro de Bourbon Duque de Galliera * Commander: Alfonso Ceballos-Escalera y Gil, Marqu√©s de La Floresta  References  Noble Compa√±√≠a de Ballesteros Hijosdalgo de San Felipe y Santiago: establecida en Alfaro : (oficio y exenci√≥n de la ballester√≠a navarra y castellana) Noble Company Ballesteros Hijosdalgo San Felipe and Santiago: Alfaro by J.

Facts Mr Ashby was prevented from voting at an election by the misfeasance of a constable, Mr White, on the apparent pretext that he was not a settled inhabitant.

This presumption may be on the part of the individual, the parents, or the physician. Non-paternity may result from sperm donation, undisclosed adoption, promiscuity, paternity fraud, non-consensual sex, as well as medical mistakes, for example, mixups during procedures such as in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. Where there is uncertainty, the most reliable technique for establishing paternity is genetic testing; however, there is still a risk of error due to the potential for gene mutations or scoring errors. Overall, the incidence of misattributed paternity ranges from about 2% to 12%, though it may be higher in certain populations. The discovery of previously unsuspected or undisclosed non-paternity may have both social and medical consequences. Non-paternity that is due to a previously undisclosed extra-marital relationship often has serious consequences for a marital relationship. Non-paternity is medically relevant when interpreting the results and utility of genetic screening for hereditary illnesses. Definitions and uses Bellis et al. (2005) stated that misattributed paternity \\"occurs when a child is believed to have been fathered by the husband (or partner) but is actually the progeny of another man.\\" Non-paternity events are also sometimes referred to as misattributed paternity, paternal discrepancy or false paternity. Although it is sometimes referred to as paternity fraud, this suggests that the misattribution was deliberate rather than accidental. In a scientific review of non-paternity studies since the 1950s, Bellis et al. (2005) stated that knowingly covering up an accidental pregnancy that resulted from infidelity is often assumed to be the reason for non-paternity, but that there are many other reasons, \\"for example, where sex with the long term partner has not produced children a woman might seek conception elsewhere.\\" They said other reasons might be undisclosed adoptions, accidental misattribution resulting from multiple relationships in close succession as well as medical mistakes, such as mixups during procedures such as in vitro fertilization and artificial insemination. In genetic genealogy the term non-paternity is often used in a wider context to indicate a break in the link between the Y-chromosome and the surname. Such a breakage may occur because of formal or informal adoption, premarital or extramarital intercourse or rape, a woman raising a baby as her own to cover for her unwed daughter's pregnancy, or when individuals use a different surname than their biological father, such as their mother's maiden name, a stepfather's name, the use of aliases or a legal name change. Testing for non-paternity The most reliable test for paternity is genetic testing, also known as DNA testing. Requirements for consent and counselling vary by country. However, genetic testing is based on probabilities and is not always definitive. Jones et al. (2010) said, \\"Characteristics of the markers and the fact that they are analysed by fallible humans can result in inconsistencies that present problems for parentage analysis.\\" False negatives may occur due to low quality samples, gene mutations, or genotyping errors (when a genotype is misread or inaccurately scored). There is a higher probability of accuracy when DNA from both parents can be tested. The accuracy increases even more when DNA from a sibling is available. Rates of non-paternityTypical births= It is difficult to accurately estimate the incidence of misattributed paternity, and there have been large discrepancies in the research published on the topic. Often data on non-paternity rates are reported tangentially to the primary goal of research without sufficient detail, and very few studies involve randomized samples. As such, it is not possible to make valid generalizations based on a large portion of the available literature. Bellis et al. (2005) found that between 1950 and 2004, the rates of misattributed paternity published in scientific journals ranged from 0.8% to 30% with a median of 3.7%. According to a study published in the Lancet, \\"High rates have been quoted, but are often unsupported by any published evidence or based on unrepresentative population samples.\\" Turi King and Mark Jobling of the Department of Genetics at University of Leicester called the commonly cited 30% rate of non-paternity an \\"urban myth\\". According to King and Jobling, the figure is around 2%. They also stated that misattributed paternity is often impacted by cultural and socioeconomic factors and that it occurs more frequently among couples who aren't married. Sociologist Michael Gilding concluded that inflated figures have been circulated by the media, the paternity testing industry, fathers' rights activists and evolutionary psychologists. He traced many of these overestimates back to a 1972 conference where non-paternity rates as high as 30% were discussed.Philipp EE (1973) \\"Discussion: moral, social and ethical issues\\". In: Wolstenholme GEW, Fitzsimons DW, eds. Law and ethics of AID and embryo transfer. Ciba Foundation symposium. Vol 17. London: Associated Scientific 63‚Äì66. Gilding states that these data only show the incidence of non-paternity in cases where disputed parentage was the reason for paternity testing. In situations where disputed parentage was the reason for the paternity testing, there were higher levels with an incidence of 17% to 33% (median of 26.9%). Most at risk of parental discrepancy were those born to younger parents, to unmarried couples and those of lower socio-economic status, or from certain ethnic and cultural groups. =Atypical multiple births= Rarely, genetic testing has revealed children from multiple births to have different fathers, which is known as \\"heteropaternal superfecundation\\". One study estimated that the incidence of bipaternal twins born to white women in the United States is around one pair in 400. Another study found the prevalence to be approximately one pair in 13,000 cases.

History In production for a mere three years (1955‚Äì1958), the series was built at the Lokomotivbau Elektrotechnische Werke works -- commonly shortened to LEW -- in Hennigsdorf, East Germany. During this time, 34 units were produced with the intention for use as a mixed traffic locomotive - hence its EU designation - though the reality is that the EU20 saw more use as a freight locomotive than a passenger one. EU20s were the first electric locomotives to be used on the route between Warsaw and Silesia. The class gained notoriety for its frequent breakdowns due to overheating of resistors, and the lack of additional cooling facilities found in other locomotives. Technical data Mechanically, the EU20 was identical to the earlier EU04 (also built by LEW), sharing the same traction engines, rectifiers, and gas compressors. Operational history During the series' 26-year service, most units were assigned to the Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski depot. EU20s were withdrawn over a 6-year period, beginning in 1976, with the last locomotive being withdrawn in 1981.

With house building, the distinction between Airdrie and Chapelhall is being eroded. Established as a small mining village in the 19th century, it now has population of around 6,560. Chapelhall is situated just off the M8 motorway east of Glasgow city centre and around west of Edinburgh. Chapelhall is also near to many of Lanarkshire's main towns, such as Bellshill (), Coatbridge (), Motherwell (), Hamilton () and Cumbernauld (), as well as being around away from Airdrie town centre. The Eurocentral freight village/industrial estate is just a mile or so away and employs people from around Lanarkshire, Glasgow and West Lothian. The rail-freight village links with Grangemouth docks away, (England to the south and beyond to mainland Europe). Chapelhall lies on the opposite side of the North Calder Water from Calderbank and has very similar history. Iron working and coal mining were once prominent - with three blast furnaces working in the early 1830s. The old village also had a quarry, a brickworks and a bakery. The first curator of Kew Gardens, William Aiton, began work as a gardener in Woodhall House near Chapelhall.https://digital.nls.uk/histories-of-scottish- families/archive/95117506#?c=0&m;=0&s;=0&cv;=49&xywh;=-258%2C1746%2C3836%2C2844 Two Celtic FC footballers came from the village, Lisbon Lions player John Clark, and Peter Grant.https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/lisbon-lion- chapelhall-man- john-10491440https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic/6609714/When- Celtics-Peter-Grant-had-to-run-from-Airdrie-fans.html  Education  In December 2001, North Lanarkshire Council published its Schools and Centres 21 (SC21) Programme, a Public Private Partnership under the broader Education 2010 plan to develop new school facilities throughout the North Lanarkshire area. In Chapelhall, the plan proposed a new joint campus for Chapelhall Primary non-denominational and St Aloysius Roman Catholic Primary Schools, which would replace the previous two separate school buildings at Gibb Street (Chapelhall) and on the Main Street (St Aloysius Primary). The initial proposal was based on the prototype Cumbernauld Primary/St Andrew's Primary site, which was endorsed by the Archdiocese of Glasgow, consisting of one public entrance, a shared office, library, gymnasium and dining hall and two adjacent staffrooms with a moveable partition that could be kept open (as both staffs preferred to do). In October 2004, however, the Diocese of Motherwell objected to the joint campus proposal, calling for separate entrances, staffrooms, staff toilets, libraries, gymnasia and nurseries, with a shared dining hall. They lodged a petition with the Scottish Government under Section 22D of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 \\\\- a subsequent review by ministers concluded that North Lanarkshire Council had acted in good faith and that the joint campus proposals did not breach the legislation. In December 2004 a series of concessions including greater segregation of staff and pupils allowed the building work to proceed. The contract was awarded to Balfour Beatty Capital, trading as Transform Schools (North Lanarkshire) Funding Plc. One concession was a moratorium on any further shared campus arrangements until the Chapelhall joint campus scheme had been evaluated. This moratorium was lifted in 2009 following the publication of a final evaluation report on shared campus schools in North Lanarkshire, produced by Dan Sweeney, a former senior official in the council's education department. The report largely endorsed the shared campus model and found that, in particular, \\"the autonomy of the individual schools, including ethos and educational principles, has been maintained, and the implementation of the Catholic Education Commission Charter has not been affected\\". The Chapelhall campus was opened on 18 August 2006. The design capacity of Chapelhall Primary is 250 and St Aloysius Primary is 320. Both schools previously provided nursery classes which have been combined to provide Early Education classes. The physical education facilities within the new building, including an on-site 7-a-side floodlit synthetic pitch, are available for community use. In addition the assembly hall/gym, dining/general purpose room and other community areas are accessible to the community. Most of the children from Chapelhall Primary graduate to Caldervale High School and most of the children from St Aloysius Primary graduate to St Margaret's High School.

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline, comic books and animated series. He is one of the G.I. Joe Team's Navy SEALs and debuted in 1986. Profile His real name is Brian M. Forrest and he holds the rank of Petty Officer Second Class (E-5). Wet Suit was born in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Wet Suit knew from an early age he wanted to join the Navy and enlisted upon his graduation from high school. He eventually applied for SEAL training, was accepted and completed arguably the military's toughest training program. Like any other SEAL, Wet Suit gained a reputation for being tough and mean, though many instructors considered him the toughest and meanest. Seeking even greater challenges, Wet Suit signed on to the G.I. Joe Team. What many overlooked was Wet-Suit's sharp mind, which was easy to miss underneath his tough and abrasive personality. He is well read in both the classics and military tactics, and his fierce demeanor is offset by a surprisingly tender home life. He also has a long-standing rivalry with teammate Leatherneck, keeping alive the tradition of competition between the Navy SEALs and the USMC. Their confrontations and verbal blow-ups are legendary, yet with their shared duty of protecting freedom, the two are the closest that each has to a friend. Toys Wet-Suit was first released as an action figure in 1986. A recolored version of his 86 figure is included in the Mission: Brazil set. A new version of Wet-Suit was released in 1992. The figure was repainted and released as part of the Battle Corps line in 1993. A version of Wet-Suit with no accessories came with the Built to Rule Depth Ray, which followed the G.I. Joe: Spy Troops story line. The forearms and the calves of the figure sported places where blocks could be attached.Depth Ray w/ Wet-Suit at YOJOE.com Retrieved 2012-04-23 Wet-Suit received a new sculpt action figure as part of the online exclusive set \\"Assault on Cobra Island\\".

These groups of people (or actors) are different kinds of professionals. The social system also contains institutes such as research institutes, publishers, and libraries. The actors and institutions perform information services such as writing, publishing, storing and retrieving documents and information. The actors are communicating in both formal and informal ways and they are producing different kinds of documents such as journal articles, books, book reviews, proceedings, bibliographies and catalogues, dictionaries, handbooks, encyclopedias and review articles. The UNISIST model can be used to define relations between various kinds of scientific and scholarly documents and to compare various domains and their discursive practices. It provides a classification of documents and information services into primary, secondary and tertiary services and products. The original UNISIST model has been updated.

In 1968 the church was designated as Grade II listed. The church was built in 1833 by John Leachman on the site of an earlier church. The previous church had been dedicated to St James from the 16th to 18th century. The new building has a simple plan: a wide nave without aisles, and a west tower. Its design and layout are similar to another of Leachman's churches in Wiltshire, Christ Church, Warminster; while Christ Church has been repeatedly extended and altered throughout its history, St Margaret's is substantially unaltered and thus remains close to Leachman's original plans. The stone church has a chancel, nave and west tower. The roof is Welsh slate. There is a west gallery on four cast iron pillars and the Royal Arms of George III. The tower has six bells, of which three are 18th-century. A clock was added to the four-stage church tower around 1885. There was a parson at Corsley in the mid-13th century. At first the church was subordinate to the main parish church at Warminster, some to the southeast. The church was dedicated to St James in or before the 16th century, and the first record of dedication to St Margaret of Antioch is from 1786. Furnishings which survive from the earlier church are the pulpit (c. 1700), painted benefaction boards and several monuments. Since 2007, Corsley parish (including a 1903 chapel of ease, St Mary's Church at Temple) has formed part of the Cley Hill benefice.

Despite initially having only two stands, much ground development was done during the mid-1990s under the leadership of then-president Andre Markgraaff, increasing the stadium's capacity to 11,000, as well as adding several suites. Between 1998 and 2008, the stadium had a sponsorship deal with ABSA Bank, during which time the stadium was known as Absa Park. Between 2009 and 2015, the stadium was known as GWK Park thanks to a sponsorship deal from Douglas-based agricultural company GWK (Griekwaland-Wes Korporatief), who also became the title sponsor of the Griquas rugby team. When the sponsorship deal with GWK expired, the stadium became known as Griqua Park. During the course of the 2010 FIFA world cup, the stadium played host the Uruguay national football team as they chose Kimberley as their host city. As such the team used the stadium as their training ground while in the city.

The club was based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, England. In a joint initiative with Breakaway Sports Tours, the Rugby Football League and Scarborough Borough Council, the club established a rugby league nines tournament known as the Scarborough Rugby League Festival. History The Scarborough and District Primary Schools under-11s rugby league team, along with Glasgow Schools, was selected to play the curtain-raiser to the 2000 Challenge Cup Final at Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh on 29 April 2000. For several years, under-11s teams from non- traditional rugby league areas were selected by the RFL with the purpose of supporting the promotion of the sport. Enthused parents of the team decided to form the Scarborough Pirates junior rugby league club soon afterwards, becoming the town's second junior rugby league club following Scarborough Sovereigns. Originally based at Pindar School the club formed a link with the Aberdeen Pub with Landlord Nick Smart, a former professional rugby league footballer. The first season concluded with the team playing at under-12s, finishing fifth in the Hull & District League. In 2002/2003, the club moved from its base at the Sunrise on Dean Road, Scarborough onto Scarborough F.C.‚Äôs McCain Lounge and the Mere Club, Seamer Road, before eventually returning to the Aberdeen, under new landlord Andy Dolan. At the beginning of 2005 the club introduced an open-age team, which joined the North East Division of the Rugby League Conference. The side incorporated some remnants of the stand-alone Yorkshire Coast Tigers open-age team that had competed in the RLC previously and extended Scarborough's representation in that competition. Professional player Kriss Brining, (York City Knights and Salford City Reds), started his career as a junior at the club. In January 2019, the club folded and withdrew from the league. the Men's team had withdrawn from the competition in August 2018, with three matches yet to play, citing lack of interest and dwindling numbers. The Junior team folded in 2019.

Gillett (November 4, 1856 ‚Äì June 11, 1937) was a lawman of the Old West, mostly well known due to his service as a Texas Ranger, and is a member of the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame. Early life and career Born James Buchanan Gillett in Austin, Texas, Gillett was raised working as a cowboy on local ranches. He joined the Texas Rangers in 1875, in Menard, Texas. Gillett initially served under Captain D. W. Roberts with \\"Company D\\", and later served with Captain N. O. Reynolds and Captain G. W. Baylor, whose daughter Helen would later marry Gillett. Mostly assigned to the West Texas border regions, Gillett found himself involved in numerous skirmishes with Kiowa, Apache, and Comanche Indians. He was involved in the July 21, 1878 killing of outlaw Sam Bass in Round Rock, Texas, when Bass was shot by Texas Ranger George Herold, and Gillett later took part in putting down both the Mason County War and the Horrell-Higgins feud. He first came to notice when, in January, 1881, while under the command of Captain Baylor, his company pursued a hostile band of Apache which had attacked a stagecoach. The Rangers surprised the band, killing six of the Apache, scattering the rest of the band. Gillett also pursued outlaw Dick Dublin that same year, killing Dublin in a gunfight. His fights with Indians and several little known outlaws made him a legend in the Ranger organization. Capture of the Baca brothers, resignation On New Year's Eve, 1881, Gillett's friend, A. M. Conklin, was murdered in El Paso by the Baca brothers, after Conkiln was involved in a fight with Onefre Baca. Gillett and fellow Ranger George Lloyd set out in pursuit of the brothers immediately after the killing. Tracking the brothers to their uncle's home, Gillett made it known they were there to bring the brothers in. The Uncle, Jose Baca, was a local Judge, and offered Gillett a $1,000 bribe to allow his nephews to go free, which Gillett refused. Gillett and Lloyd captured all of the brothers at Jose Baca's house with the exception of Onefre Baca. Onefre Baca had fled to Mexico, and upon learning this, but receiving no authorization to enter Mexico, Gillett crossed the border into Mexico illegally to arrest Onefre Baca, and then took him to Socorro, Texas to be held until he could be taken back to El Paso. Shortly afterward, Onefre Baca was lynched by an angry mob. After only six years service, under protests that he illegally arrested Baca by entering Mexico and under pressure from Texas Governor Oran M. Roberts, Gillett resigned from the Rangers at the rank of sergeant, accepting a position as Deputy Marshal for El Paso, Texas, in June, 1882, working briefly under famed gunman Dallas Stoudenmire. Gillett held the marshals position until 1885, when he left to accept a job managing the Estado Land and Cattle Company, a position he held for another six years. He started his own ranch after that, in Alpine, Texas, then moved he and his family to Roswell, New Mexico in 1907. Purchasing the Barrell Spring Ranch, Gillett then began raising a premium herd of Hereford cattle. Gillett retired from ranching in 1923, leasing his ranch to his son Milton, and moved to Marfa, Texas. In 1921, Gillett had written his memoirs, Six years with the Texas Rangers, which has remained in print since. He died of heart failure on June 11, 1937, and is buried in the Marfa cemetery. In his book \\"The Captured: A True Story of Abduction by Indians on the Texas Frontier\\" (St. Martin's Press, 2004, pgs.211-212) Scott Zesch records an incident when Gillett, along with another young ranger Ed Seiker, fought in a running battle with a band of Apache Indians during which the two nearly killed a 'white Indian' named Herman Lehmann who had been captured and adopted by the Indians and had become a warrior himself, and also killed and mutilated an Apache warrior named Nusticeno who they \\"butchered terribly\\": \\"In their zeal, the novice rangers had shot the Apache countless times, carved the skin off him, and even decapitated him,\\" and took his bow, quiver, shield, and moccasins as trophies.

Headlamps may also be used in adventure races. Headlamps are often used by workers in underground mining, search and rescue, surgeons, and by other workers who need hands-free lighting. Description Headlamps are usually powered by three or four AA or AAA batteries. Systems with heavy batteries (4xAA or more) are usually designed so that the light emitter is positioned near the front of the head, with the battery compartment at the rear of the head. The headlamp is strapped to the head or helmet with an elasticized strap. It is sometimes possible to completely disconnect a headlamp's battery pack, for storage on a belt or in a pocket. Lighter headlamp systems are strapped to the user's head by a single band; heavier ones utilize an additional band over the top of the user's head. White LEDs were quickly adopted for use in headlamps due to their smaller size, lower power consumption and improved durability compared with incandescent bulbs. Andrew Skurka, The Ultimate Hiker's Gear Guide: Tools and Techniques to Hit the Trail, National Geographic Books, 2012, pp. 166-169 Power LEDs rated 1 watt or more have displaced incandescent bulbs in many models of headlamps. To avoid damage to electronic parts, a heatsink is usually required for headlamps that use LEDs that dissipate more than 1W. To regulate power fed to the LEDs, DC-DC converters are often used, sometimes controlled by microprocessors. This allows the LED(s) to provide brightness that is not affected by a drop in battery voltage, and allows selectable levels of output. Following the introduction of LEDs for headlamps, sometimes combinations of LED and halogen lamps were used, allowing the user to select between the types for various tasks. History Coal miners wearing headlamps in 1946. At the end of the shift the lamps would be checked into the lamp house for recharging and maintenance. Carbide lamps were developed around 1900, and remained in use even as electric lamps appeared, because of poor battery life of the latter designs. The advent of high-efficiency LED lamps eventually displaced incandescent or combustion lamps. Thomas Edison developed electric cap lamps for miners starting in 1914; by 1915, certain cap lamps were approved by the United States Bureau of Mines for safe use in gassy coal mines. These included features such as spring-loaded contacts to automatically disconnect broken bulbs. These lamps consisted of a reflector and incandescent lamp and a separate belt-mounted wet-cell storage battery. The battery was sized to power the lamp for the entire working shift. After 12 hours a 1917-era miner's lamp produced less than one candlepower and about 2 to 5 total lumens. This pattern became popular for similar lamps. Head lamps approved for use in coal mines are designed not to allow an internal spark to ignite flammable gas surrounding the headlamp.

The year saw war against the Veii and Fidenae which resulted in the appointment of a dictator, Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus. Postumius and his colleague Quinctius served under the dictator, probably as legatus, while his other colleague Cornelius was appointed as magister equitum.

The conflict began on 18 September 1948 in Madiun, East Java, and ended three months later when most FDR leaders and members were detained and executed by TNI forces.  Events prior to the revolt  The downfall of Sjarifuddin Cabinet and the formation of Hatta Cabinet = Opinions regarding the trigger of the conflict vary. According to Kreutzer, the downfall of Amir Sjarifuddin government in January 1948 was the origin of the Madiun Affair. Before then, during the second half of the 1947, Partai Sosialis was split into two factions; one faction was led by Sjarifuddin and the smaller faction led by Sutan Sjahrir. Sjahrir group's opposition grew bigger as Sjarifudin put strong emphasis on their alignment with Russia and class welfare. Sjahrir believed that Marxist doctrine of class welfare could not be applied in Indonesian community as there were no such Indonesian bourgeoisie, and that Indonesia should maintain a \\"positive neutrality,\\" so that Indonesia could contribute to world peace. They completely split soon after the establishment of Hatta's presidential cabinet. Sjarifuddin premiership ended on 28 January 1948. Prior to this, Sjahrir, Dr. Leimena, and several political activists approached Hatta and requested him to become the next prime minister. Hatta agreed on the condition that he got PNI and Masjumi's support. Driven by the need to form a cabinet with national support (both right-wing and left-wing), Hatta offered Sjarifuddin's faction some posts in the cabinet., based on Soe's interview with Hatta in Jakarta, September 27, 1967 They declined Hatta's offer and demanded key positions, including Sjarifuddin position as Minister of Defense (In the previous cabinet, Sjarifuddin was both Prime Minister and Minister of Defense) in return of their support for Hatta's government. Negotiation failed, and on January 31, 1948, Hatta finally formed a cabinet without the Sajap Kiri (left- wing) parties. Two members of Partai Sosialis, however, were included in the cabinet based on a strong request by Sjahrir. Sjahrir and the two cabinet members were expelled from the Partai Sosialis and formed their own party called Partai Sosialis Indonesia (PSI, the Socialist Party of Indonesia). \\"This new party immediately gave its support to Hatta's government.\\" Hatta's program of government was based on two priorities; the implementation of the Renville Agreement, and the rationalization of the Indonesian army. = The formation of FDR = The Sajap Kiri (without Sjahrir's faction) gradually went into opposition. In the beginning they tried to get a place in the government by showing willingness to co-operate. However, their attempt failed when they faced bitter reality that there were no faction members included in the cabinet. At a mass meeting at Surakarta on February 26 the Sajap Kiri underwent reorganization and emerged as the Front Demokrasi Rakjat (FDR; People's Democratic Front) led by Amir Sjarifuddin which comprised Partai Sosialis, PKI, PBI, Pesindo, and trade union federation SOBSI. Some weeks later after the meeting, FDR' program was radically changed. The new program ordered, among others, (1) opposition of the Renville Agreement; (2) discontinuation of the negotiations with the Dutch; and (3) nationalization of all foreign enterprises. Their strong opposition against Hatta's cabinet was obviously seen from the first objective of the program. While Hatta's cabinet main goal was to implement the Renville agreement, the FDR's was to reject it. The FDR had two principal bases of strength: within the army and among labor. In his capacity of Minister of Defense from July 3, 1947 to January 28, 1948, Sjarifuddin had \\"managed to build up a strong personal opposition within the army\\". He was able to secure officers' loyalty in the army, the TNI (Tentara National Indonesia; Indonesian National Army). Those loyal military officers were often the ones who knew the location of numerous arms and munitions kept in the mountainous areas in anticipation of further Dutch military action. Even more important was the strong position Sjarifuddin had built himself within the army's supplementary organization, the TNI Masjarakat (People's TNI). Established in early August 1947 (when Sjarifuddin was the Prime Minister), this organization was aimed at organizing popular defense on a local basis to support the army. While the TNI was a national organization, the TNI Masjarakat, led by Colonel Djoko Sujono, was a local-based military organization. It was obvious that during his premiership, Sjarifuddin managed to build strong both national and local military organizations prepared to confront the Dutch. In addition, the FDR had a clearly dominant position within SOBSI (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia), by far the largest labor organization in Indonesia. The member of this organization was mainly urban and plantation labor with the Republic, and its member was estimated to be between 200,000 and 300,000. = Hatta's rationalization program and its impact on FDR's military strength = From the Indonesian government's perspective, rationalization was the solution to economic problem by reducing the number of military forces. A month after the establishment of his cabinet, Hatta began the rationalization program based on Presidential Decree No.9 27 February 1948. The main objective of the rationalization was to reorganize the military organizations and to mobilize productive labor force from defense to production sectors. According to Hatta, there were three ways to achieving those objectives; 1) demobilize military officers who wanted to return to their previous jobs (teachers, private employees), 2) send the military officers back to the ministry of development and youth, and 3) demobilize hundreds of military officers to return to village communities. In 1948, the Indonesian Republic faced a critical situation in which there was an excessive labor supply due to the enormous refugees fled to the Republic from the areas overrun by Dutch such as Surabaya (located adjacent to Madiun, Surabaya was then still under the Dutch colonials). In addition, there were at least 200,000 excess troops in the Republic while there was an inadequate number of arms and munitions for them. To anticipate the critical problems‚Äîeconomic, military, and political‚Äîemerging from this situation, Hatta and his cabinet immediately decided to embark upon a rationalization program. At the initial stage of reorganization, there were 160,000 troops left. This program was expected to leave only 57,000 regular troops at the end. On May 15, 1948, the TNI Masjarakat or laskar, one of the principal bases of FDR's strength, was demobilized. Western-oriented and pro-government military officers wanted a smaller, more disciplined, and more trustworthy army under their leadership. They viewed TNI masjarakat as less well-trained and uneducated military organization which was strongly associated with communist organizations. The government wanted the Army to be led by professional officers who had undergone serious military training. Two pro-government military organizations, West Java Siliwangi Division and the Corps Polisi Militer (CPM, Military Police Corp), were officially acknowledged and given legal status. The demobilization of TNI masjarakat means the influence of FDR in the government was getting weaker and this deepened the FDR's resentment against the government. From the FDR's perspective, rationalization was an attempt to destroy FDR's power. FDR was not the only group that opposed Hatta's rationalization. Among the military unit which began to oppose the Hatta government was Division IV, better known as Divisi Senopati, which was stationed in Solo and placed under the command of Colonel Sutarto. Like FDR, Division IV was also disappointed with Hatta's rationalization and protested against the program on May 20, 1948. Hatta's decision to incorporate Division IV into Division I would place Colonel Sutarto in 'reserve officer' position. Sutarto and his soldiers ignored the instruction and began to reorganize their own division. They transformed Division IV into a \\"battle-ready military unit\\" which gained support from the majority of Solo's population and FDR followers. They named this unit Divisi Pertempuran Panembahan Senopati (Battle-Division Duke Senopati). Sutarto was mysteriously murdered on July 2, 1948. For those who were pro-FDR, this murder was perceived as part of the Hatta's rationalization program. = Delanggu strike = Disappointed by Hatta's rationalization, the FDR/PKI began to seek support from farmers and labors by advocating land reform and organizing labor strikes. One of FDR/PKI's principal bases of strength was SOBSI. Heavily dominated by communists, SOBSI organized a number of strikes to protest against the government. The most important strike took place in Solo. Plantation workers protested against the government in response to deteriorating condition of the economy following economic blockade by the Dutch and government's failure to eliminate feudalism and to stop the \\"speculative operation of black market.\\" The strike at Delanggu cutton-growing area was organized by SABUPRI (the union of communist- oriented plantation workers), and around 20,000 workers went on strike for around 35 days. The government accused the FDR and SABUPRI leaders of endangering the Republic by organizing the strike. They responded to this accusation by saying that it was the government that endangered the Republic with its ineffective and incorrect economic policies. What the FDR and SOBSI leaders wanted from the government was better implementation of the existing regulations and agrarian reforms. The strike came to an end on 18 July 1948, with the government willing to accept workers' demand for two-meter long textile and rice that would be given every month in addition to their salary. = The foreign relations of the Republic of Indonesia = The Madiun Affair should be placed in an international context in which two superpower countries played a role in the Indonesian government's decision making. Suripno was a young communist who became the representative of the Republic of Indonesia at the Congress of World Federation of Democratic Youth in Prague in 1947. He was also given a mandate to contact the Soviet Union. On January 1948, he met a Russian ambassador and discussed future consular relationship between Russia and Indonesia. The Soviet government finally took the initiative by informing Suripno that the Consular Treaty had been rectified. Instead of accepting the treaty, Hatta's government decided to suspend the bilateral relationship. Suripno was then asked to return to Indonesia. On August 11, 1948 Suripno arrived at Jogjakarta with his 'secretary' who turned out to be Musso, a senior Indonesian communist leader. When asked to give official report to the Minister of Foreign Affairs Haji Agus Salim, Suripno praised Russia for its political stance that had always acknowledged Indonesia as a sovereign state. Hatta repeatedly refused the Consular Treaty because he was inclined to seek assistance to the United States' power. On July 21, Sukarno, Hatta, Minister for the Interior, Minister for Information, and the US representative had a meeting at a hotel in Sarangan, Madiun. The Dutch and the US had a common goal which was to control the natural resources. On September 17, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affair stated that communist expansion in Indonesia was the main obstacle to the western power to acquire the resources. The Dutch wanted the US to believe that Indonesia was the bulwark of communists. The US, however, decided to \\"include Hatta and his association in one international anti-communist front to be established in East and Southeast Asia\\" to challenge the Soviet Union. The Dutch's attempt to restore its control over Indonesia, by bringing Indonesian leaders and the US representatives into conflict, failed. = The return of Musso and the reorganization of FDR/PKI = The return of Musso was the catalyst of the Madiun Affair. Sukarno officially invited Musso in his presidential palace in Jogjakarta. According to a journalist report, the meeting was very emotional. They embraced each other and eyes were filled in tears. Musso was, in fact, Sukarno's political senior and they were good friend when they resided in Surabaya. Musso's return was a turning point of FDR's political journey. During the party conference on August 26 and 27, 1948, they adopted a new political line. They established a new body that consisted of left-wing parties. Members of this new political bureau were FDR leaders (Maruto Darusman, Tan Ling Djie, Harjono, Setiadjit, Djoko Sujono, Aidit, Wikana, Suripno, Amir Sjarifuddin, and Alimin) with Musso serving as the chairman. These re-appointments were made legitimate grounds by FDR/PKI's enemies to launch \\"anti-PKI campaign\\". The government prepared some strategies to \\"eliminate the Communists\\". One of the government's biggest accusations was that Musso promoted \\"the Republic's involvement in a Soviet- American conflict\\". The unification of these political forces was a fatal mistake. = Towards the revolt = The FDR leaders made propaganda tour through Central and East Java. Their main purpose was to promote Musso's political ideas. Other PKI leaders remained in Jogjakarta trying to negotiate with PNI and Masjumi leaders to form a new cabinet that would include FDR's representatives. The situation inside FDR was still chaotic even after the unification of several political forces. For instance, some members of PKI and Partai Sosialis in Bojonegoro opposed the decision made during the meeting on August 26 and 27, 1948. As a new structure, FDR was technically not strong enough to confront any challenges from the outside. During this period, there were small clashes involving pro-Hatta military groups on the one side and pro-FDR armed groups on the other. After the murder of Colonel Sutarto, political development in Solo became more intense. The coming of Siliwangi Division, which was \\"loyal to government and anti-leftist\\", was also one of the causes of political instability in Solo which was the base of Senopati Division. The FDR's power started to diminish after several cases of murdering and kidnapping of the \\"leftist officers\\". Kreutzer provides examples of kidnapping and murdering cases on weeks prior to the Madiun Affair. \\"On September 1, two members of Solo's PKI were kidnapped and later interrogated about the activities and organization of PKI in Solo. On the same day, however, members of Pesindo kidnapped some pro-government leaders. They were accused of kidnapping PKI members. Six days later, on September 7, almost all officers and a number of lower-ranking soldiers of Commander Yadau's Tentara Laut Republik Indonesia (TLRI, Republican Navy) were kidnapped and brought to a base of Siliwangi Division, a pro-government military unit. On September 9, Suadi, Sutarto's successor as Commander of Senopati Division, obtained the official approval by Indonesian Army Commander Sudirman to investigate the murder and kidnapping of people in Jogja and Solo. But shortly after the investigation had started, a number of officers, who were given orders to interrogate the suspects, were kidnapped, too. On September 13 in Blitar, south of Malang, government units arrested a number of Pesindo members.\\" On September 16, Pesindo's headquarter was attacked. Solo, the second city of the Republic after Jogjakarta, became the scene of a complex conflict between the government and leftist groups during the first two weeks of September. Solo was now dominated by the pro-government rightist. This made Madiun he FDR last important stronghold after Jogja and Solo controlled by the Indonesian Republic, and Surabaya was under Dutch control. Unfortunately, anti-communist groups and pro-Hatta's government had already infiltrated Madiun since the beginning of September.  The revolt  Two men with rope around their necks are handcuffed by TNI officers on September 1948 in Madiun, Indonesia Alarmed by what happened in Solo, FDR local leaders in Madiun began to feel uneasy and they reported this to FDR leaders in Kediri which is located more than thirty- five miles east of Madiun. Then he received an order to disarm the agitators in Madiun to avoid possible bloodshed in the area. At 3 a.m on September 18, 1948, the FDR began to seize the local government officers, telephone exchange, and army headquarters with Sumarsono and Djoko Sujono as the leaders of the operation. It was a brief fighting ending up with two loyal officers being killed and four wounded. Within hours, Madiun was under the FDR's control. Two FDR members, Setiadjit and Wikana, took over the civil administration and established the Pemerintah Front National Daerah Madiun (Government of the National Front of the Region of Madiun). Sumarsono then announced over the local radio, \\"From Madiun victory begins\\". After hearing about what happened on September 18, Musso and Sjarifuddin returned to Madiun. They immediately discussed the situation with Sumarsono, Setiadjit, and Wikana upon their arrival. At ten o'clock on the night of September 19, 1948, President Sukarno declared that the Madiun revolt was an attempt to overthrow the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and that Musso had formed a Soviet government. He also stated that Indonesians had to choose between him and Hatta and Musso and his communist party. Sukarno was followed by Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX who had very strong influence among Javanese society. In his speech, he asked people to help Sukarno and Hatta and give them full mandate to crush the communist movement. At 11.30 p.m. the same day, Musso replied to Sukarno. He declared a war against the Indonesian government. He tried to convince Indonesian people that Sukarno and Hatta were the slaves of American Imperialism, \\"traitors\\", and \\"Romusha dealers\\". There was mounting tension between the Sukarno-Hatta and FDR leaders. Some FDR leaders decided to go in different directions from Musso. On September 20, 1948, they declared their willingness to reconcile with the Indonesian government. In the evening, Colonel Djoko Sujono, Military Commandant in the Madiun, broadcast over the radion that what happened in Madiun was not a coup, but it was an attempt to correct the government's policy which \\"led the revolution into different direction\\". He was followed by Sumarsono, the original leader of the revolt. Sumarsono made a similar public announcement that the Madiun event was not a coup, but an attempt to correct the political aims of Hatta's government. On his attempt to convince the government, on 23 September Amir Sjarifuddin stated that FDR's constitution was that of the Republic of Indonesia; their flag remained red and white; and their national anthem was still Indonesia Raya.  The aftermath: the fall of FDR leaders  150px The Indonesian government seemed to ignore some FDR leaders' attempt to end the conflict. They used this small revolt to \\"crack down the Indonesian left\\". The military operation was led by Colonel Gatot Soebroto and Nasution, and they promised to settle the mess within two weeks' time. Hatta insisted to curb the rebellion and seize Madiun as soon as possible before the Dutch started to intervene. The government started anti-Communist purge from Jogjakarta and Solo. On September 30, the government sent Lt. Col. Sadikin, the Siliwangi Division brigade, to mobilize his troops and control Madiun. In order to avoid conflicts with the Indonesian Armed Forces, FDR/PKI leaders began to retreat to mountainous areas. Under the command of Sjarifuddin, they fled Madiun and headed to a small village Kandangan where they could find munitions and arms (a store built up when Sjarifuddin was the Prime Minister and Minister of Defense). To their surprise, the village was already occupied by the batalion of the Sungkono Division led by Major Sabarudin. On October 28, the government arrested 1,500 men of the last rebel military unit. Musso was shot dead three days later on October 31 when he hid in a restroom and refused to surrender. His body was brought to Ponorogo, set on display for public view before being set ablaze. A month later, on November 29, Djoko Sujono and Maruto Darusman were arrested. Sjarifuddin faced the same fate when he was captured on 4 December. Three days later, on December 7, 1948, \\"TNI headquarters announced the final extermination of the rebellion and stated that approximately 35,000 people, mostly troops, had been arrested. On December 19, Sjarifuddin, Maruto Darusman, Djoko Sujono, Suripno and other FDR leaders were executed. Estimated casualties were 24,000 in total (8,000 in Mandiun, 4,000 in Cepu and 12,000 in Ponorogo, as the affair affected neighbouring areas) While most of FDR/PKI leaders were detained and executed, Sumarsono managed to escape. He fled Madiun and headed north into the Dutch territory. He was finally arrested by Dutch troops because of the illegal possession of gold and treasury. Although initially the Dutch authorities were suspicious of his involvement in the Madiun Affair, he managed to deceive them by showing false identity. He was released on July 30, 1949, but was arrested again on October 29, 1949, for his identity fraud case. The Dutch kept investigating his background, and on November 11, 1949, they revealed Sumarsono's identity and his political actions in the Madiun Affair. The Dutch authorities decided to execute him in New Guinea. But before that happened, Sumarsono ran away from prison on December 13, 1949, and managed to escape the execution. He then fled to North Sumatera and lived there as a teacher. He was arrested again during anti- Communist campaign launched by the Indonesian government under Suharto in 1965.

Pochuck Mountain's summit and most of its peaks lie within Vernon Township, Sussex County, New Jersey, although the south-western portion of the ridge lies within Hardyston Township, and the north-eastern tip of the ridge extends over the New York state line into Orange County. The ridge marks the eastern edge of the Great Appalachian Valley, and it divides the watersheds of the Wallkill River and its tributary Pochuck Creek. The two rivers meet at Pochuck Neck, marking the terminus of the ridge. Etymology The name Pochuck is a Lenape word meaning \\"out-of-the-way place.\\" It may have named so because it is an outlier of the New York-New Jersey Highlands, separated from the rest of the region by the Vernon Valley.Hikes in the Mid- Atlantic States This separation gives Pochuck Mountain an unusually high prominence of approximately 695 feet. Geography Pochuck Mountain and Wawayanda Mountain to the east form the borders of the Vernon Valley, an important farming and mining area of New Jersey drained by Pochuck Creek. Immediately to the northwest of the ridge lies the Black Dirt Region, which is drained by the Wallkill River. Both valleys are part of an elongated lowland region known as the Great Appalachian Valley that divides the Appalachian Mountains for hundreds of miles. Due to the unusual positioning of Pochuck Mountain relative to the neighboring mountains, the Vernon Valley is a somewhat isolated prong of the rest of the Great Appalachian Valley. =Watershed= As the entire mountain is drained by the Wallkill River and its tributary Pochuck Creek, the region lies completely within the Wallkill River watershed. The Wallkill River flows northeast until it joins Rondout Creek near Rifton, New York. Rondout Creek then tributes the Hudson River in Kingston, New York. The Hudson River ultimately drains into the Atlantic Ocean via the New York Harbor. Lakes on Pochuck Mountain include Lake Glenwood, Lake Pochung, Lake Wallkill, Pleasant Valley Lake, Tall Timbers Lake, Lake Panorama, Louemma Lake, and Scenic Lakes (2 manmade lakes in the Scenic Lakes community). Their waters are used for a variety of recreational purposes including fishing, swimming, boating and ice skating. =Mountain passes= * Lake Pochung Road separates the summit from the ridge's southwestern peaks. * CR 565 (Glenwood Road) separates the summit from the ridge's northern peaks. * CR 641 (Drew Mountain Road) separates the summit from the ridge's northeastern peaks. * Glenwood Mountain Road separates several of the ridge's northeastern peaks. =Appalachian Trail= The Appalachian Trail runs over the top of the ridge within Wawayanda State Park, north of the summit. Geology Pochuck (center) seen from the north Pochuck Mountain is part of the Reading Prong of the New England Uplands subprovince of the New England province of the Appalachian Highlands. In fact, it is the northernmost ridge of the Reading Prong in New Jersey. The rocks that form Pochuck Mountain are comprised from the same belt that make up nearby Wawayanda Mountain. This belt consists of ancient crystalline metamorphic rocks. As such, the New England province as a whole, along with the similarly composed Blue Ridge province further south, are often together referred to as the Crystalline Appalachians. The Crystalline Appalachians extend as far north as the Green Mountains of Vermont and as far south as the Blue Ridge Mountains, although a segment of the belt between the Reading Prong and South Mountain in Pennsylvania does not break the Earth's surface. The Crystalline Appalachians are distinct from the parallel Sedimentary Appalachians which run from Georgia to New York. The nearby Kittatinny Mountains are representative of these sedimentary formations. Portions of the Reading Prong in New Jersey are known to contain Uranium deposits, linked to reported Radon contamination in certain residential areas developed on the prong.The Pennsylvania Radon Story The naturally occurring Radon (226Ra) is a product of the decay chain of the Uranium isotope 238U. Wildlife Mammals inhabiting Pochuck Mountain include black bear, white-tailed deer, opossum, foxes, raccoons, squirrels, skunk, bobcat, fisher, porcupine, coyote bats, chipmunks, groundhogs and field mice. Industry While the developed portions of Pochuck Mountain have largely been put to residential use, the mountain and its foothills have historically been a center for mining. In 1871, the South Vernon extension of the Sussex Railroad from Hamburg to McAfee (paralleling present-day Route 94) serviced iron ore mining operations on the east side of the ridge in Vernon Township. Today, a substantial portion of the southwestern face of the ridge near Scenic Lakes is being used by Raia Industries to support gneiss mining, which has raised substantial concern among local residents with regard to environmental degradation and habitat loss for native and migratory species.

F. M√∏ller, was a Danish architect, professor and, from 1965 to 1969, the first rector of the Aarhus School of Architecture. His former practice, Arkitektfirmaet C. F. M√∏ller, which he founded in 1924, still exists and bears his name. It is today the largest architectural firm in Denmark with branch offices in several countries. Biography Christian Frederik M√∏ller was born in Skanderborg, Denmark. He was the son of Valdemar M√∏ller and Nielssine Dalby. He first trained as a mason and later studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen, graduating in 1920. He conducted study trips to England (1925); Germany, Italy and France (1927); Germany, Switzerland and Italy (1937). He exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition during 1952-64, 1973, 1978, 1985. He set up his own architectural office C.F. M√∏ller in 1924, and in 1928 formed a partnership with the architect and Professor Kay Fisker (1893‚Äì1965) which lasted until 1942. After winning first prizes in the competitions for Aarhus Community Hospital in 1930 and Aarhus University in 1931, they established an office in Aarhus in 1932. Their buildings also include the apartment blocks 2 Vodroffsvej (1930) and Vesters√∏hus (1935‚Äì39) in Copenhagen, the latter of which has remained a major influence on Danish housing architecture. Their winning proposal for Aarhus University consisted of individual faculty buildings arranged along the margin of an undulating park setting. The first building at the site was completed in 1933. By the early 40s, the collaboration with Fisker had ended and C. F. M√∏ller was left to complete the Aarhus University alone. M√∏ller was present at the construction site when the British Royal Air Force bombed the University dormitories, which were occupied by the Gestapo, on 31 October 1944. During the attack, a bomb accidentally struck the main building, and M√∏ller was lightly injured as a result, while about ten members of the construction crew were killed. The main building was completed in 1946 and the so-called Book Tower in 1962. Later works include Salling Department Store im Aarhus (1949, with Gunnar Krohn), Anglig√•rden (1965, later Herning Art Museum) and Eget√¶pper in Herning (1984). M√∏ller was Royal Building Inspector from 1953 to 1968, and in 1965 he became the first rector of the newly founded Aarhus School of Architecture. Personal life In 1928, he married Bodil Marie Jacobsen (1904-1996). He died in Aarhus at 90 years of age and was buried at Vestre Kirkeg√•rd in Aarhus.

The Chief of the Defence Force (CDF) leads the Australian Defence Force and the Secretary of Defence leads the Department of Defence though both jointly manage the Australian Defence Organisation under a diarchy, and both report directly to the Minister for Defence. The highest active rank in the Australian Defence Force is reserved for the Chief of the Defence Force. This is a four-star rank and the CDF is the only Australian military officer at that level. As a result of the diarchy, the Secretary of the Department of Defence is of the equivalent civilian four-starlevel in the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service.  Command and Control  The Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Defence Force is set out under Section 68 of the Constitution of Australia, stating \\"the command in chief of the naval and military forces of the Commonwealth is vested in the Governor-General as the Queen's representative\\". In practice, the Governor-General is the ceremonial head of the Australian Defence Force and command and control power is delegated to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. The National Security Committee of Cabinet also plays an important role in the strategic direction of the Australian Defence Organisation including directing overseas deployments and going to war.  Five-star level  Currently the five-star level is not an active serving rank in the Australian Defence Force. The first holder of this rank was William Birdwood, who was appointed as Field Marshal on 20 March 1925. George VI was appointed Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force, maintaining the rank from 2 June 1939 until his death on 6 February 1952. Also, Prince Philip maintains the ranks of Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet, and Marshal of the Royal Australian Air Force. He was appointed to each rank on 2 April 1954. Australia has only had one active serving five-star rank officer within the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Australia, Thomas Blamey, who was appointed Field Marshal in the Australian Army in June 1950. He was presented his field marshal's baton by the then Governor-General William McKell in hospital that September, and Blamey, who was seriously ill at the time, died in May 1951.  Four-star level  In the Australian Defence Force, guided by the Defence Force Regulations 1952, the level of four-star rank is that of commissioned officer O-10 in the Australian Defence Force ranks code. This means the Australian Army rank of general, the Royal Australian Navy rank of admiral, and the Royal Australian Air Force rank of air chief marshal.

History The station was opened by the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway in March 1897 and closed by British Railways in 1955. The station building made use of the LD&ECR;'s standard modular architecture.Warsop station photos PictureThePast After leaving Shirebrook North station, the line crossed the Midland Nottingham to Worksop line (now the Robin Hood Line and passed the LD&ECR; Warsop yard near Warsop Junction. These yards are still in use, currently by EWS. To the north was a branch to Warsop Main Colliery with extensive marshalling yards, now closed. Shortly after this, in the days when the line was built, the line ran into countryside, crossing Warsop Vale, and arrived at Warsop station. These were in the days before the deep mines appeared penetrating the limestone cap. Between Warsop and Edwinstowe the line climbed from the valley of the River Meden, heading for that of the River Maun. This was the beginning of the area known as The Dukeries, heavily promoted in the railway's literature in the hope of attracting tourist trade. It passed by Warsop Windmill, where the GCR were later to provide a branch to Welbeck Colliery before reaching Clipstone, where it had been planned to build a branch to Mansfield. Instead it had built a curve into the Midland Railway line mentioned above. Sidings, however, were provided for the Duke of Portland. Further on into the Maun valley the GCR did build a junction for Mansfield Central, initially facing Lincoln, but then converted to a triangular one. Latterly this extended only to a group of collieries, all now closed. Passenger Services There never was a Sunday service calling at Warsop. In 1922 the advertised services were: Eastbound *1 train to Nottingham Victoria via Mansfield Central *4 trains to Mansfield Central, with two extra on Saturdays *2 trains to Lincoln High Street (later renamed Lincoln Central, now plain Lincoln), with an extra on Friday, Lincoln's Market Day Westbound *4 trains to Chesterfield Market Place, with two extra on Saturdays *1 to Langwith Junction (later renamed Shirebrook North) on Fridays *1 to Langwith Junction (later renamed Shirebrook North) on Saturdays Passengers aiming for Mansfield on Saturday evenings could catch the 22:44, non-stop Eastbound to Mansfield Central or wait for the 23:38 westbound to Langwith Junction which doubled back down what is now the Robin Hood Line to the Midland station at Mansfield, arriving at Midnight. The position in August 1939 was not greatly changed, though the late train to Mansfield Central had disappeared.Bradshaw, August 1939 flickr By the Summer of 1964 all regular timetabled local services had been gone for nine years, but it was still possible to catch a train to Mablethorpe or Skegness, or even to Radford via the Warsop to Shirebrook Junction curve, but it would be the following Saturday before a direct train back.1964 Working Timetable (Up) flickr1964 Working Timetable (Down flickr Modern Times The line through the station site gives access from Shirebrook to UK Coal's Thoresby Colliery and to the High Marnham Test Track. Since the closure of Thoresby Colliery, the traffic on the line has rapidly decreased and the line only has the High Marnham Test Track trains running every few months. There is some hope of reopening the line as a branch off the Robin Hood Line and reopening Warsop, and stations, providing an hourly service to Mansfield and Nottingham.

Shivaprakash (Hulkuntemath Shivamurthy Sastri Shivaprakash, born 1954) is a leading poet and playwright writing in Kannada. He is professor at the School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. He heads the Cultural Centre at Berlin, known as the Tagore Centre, as Director run by Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). He has seven anthologies of poems, twelve plays, and several other books to his credit. His works have been widely translated into English, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Polish, Hindi, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. His plays have been performed in Kannada, Hindi, Meitei, Rabha, Assamese, Bodo, Tamil and Malayalam. Shivaprakash is also a well-known authority on vachana literature, Bhakti movements of India, and Sufi and other mystic traditions.Transmutations of Power and Desire in Bhakti Expressions Life and career Shivaprakash was born in Bangalore in June 1954. His father Shivamurthy Shastri was an eminent Lingayat scholar and served under the erstwhile Maharaja of Mysore. After obtaining his MA in English literature from Bangalore University, Shivaprakash joined the Karnataka government service as an English lecturer and taught for over two decades at various colleges in Bangalore and Tumkur. In 1996, he was appointed the editor of Indian Literature, the bimonthly journal of Sahitya Akademi in New Delhi. Shivaprakash joined the School of Arts and Aesthetics in Jawaharlal Nehru University as Associate professor in 2001, where he is professor of Aesthetics and Performance studies. In 2000, he was selected for the International Writing Program of the School of Letters, University of Iowa, and is honorary fellow of the school. Professor H. S. Shiva Prakash has been appointed Director of Tagore Centre in Berlin. The appointment is for three years Poet Shivaprakash published his first anthology of poems Milarepa in 1977, when he was still 23. It was immediately recognized as a fresh voice in Kannada poetry.Ki. Ram.Nagaraj, \\"\\"Milarepa\\" Kuritu\\", in Milarepa, Kannada Sangha, Christ College, Bangalore, 1977 But Shivaprakash gained popularity and acclaim only with his second anthology, Malebidda Neladalli in 1983. The poem \\"Samagara Bhimavva\\" became an instant hit, which brought him to the centre-stage of post-Bandaya Kannada poetry.Malebidda Neladalli, Kannada Sangha, Christ College, Bangalore, 1983 Since then Shivaprakash has published four collections of poetry, Anukshana Charite, Suryajala, Maleye Mantapa and Matte Matte and two anthologies of poems in translation, Maruroopagalu and Nanna Mainagara, and edited the translation of contemporary Gujarati poetry, Samakaleena Gujarati Kavitegalu and Malayalam poetry Manasantara. Shivaprakash's poems make use of mystic symbolism, dream- images, archetypes and motifs from everyday life to portray the nature of power and the contradictions of modern life. Playwright Shivaprakash published his first play Mahachaitra in 1986. The stage-adaptation of the play by C.G.Krishnaswamy for the troop Samudaya became a major hit. The play was based on the life and times of the 12th century Lingayat saint Basavanna and narrated the struggles of the artisan saints of the city of Kalyana (now Basavakalyan) through a Marxist analytic. The play received rave reviews and was acknowledged as a landmark in Kannada literature.Mahachaitra, Sneha Prakashana, Bangalore, 1991, p. 94 Mahachaitra is recognized as one among the three greatest plays out of the 25-odd plays on Basavanna written in Kannada, the other two being P. Lankesh's Sankranti and Girish Karnad's Taledanda. Shivaprakash won the Karnataka Sahitya Akademi award for this play. His other plays include Sultan Tipu, Shakespeare Swapnanauke, Manteswamy Kathaprasanga, Madari Madayya, Madurekanda, Madhavi, Matrika, Makarachandra, Sati, Cassandra and Maduvehennu. He has also translated Shakespeare's King Lear and adapted Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife into Kannada under the title Mallammana Mane Hotlu and Shakespeare's Macbeth under the name Maranayakana Drishtanta. Manteswamy Kathaprasanga, a play about a 16th-century Dalit saint was made into a successful stage adaptation by director Suresh Anagalli and produced over 300 shows. It kindled interest in this obscure saint and the life of Manteswamy has since been a major area of research in Kannada academia. Most of Shivaprakash's plays are inspired by Marxism and Shaiva mysticism, particularly Lingayatism and Kashmir Shavism. The plays also employ motifs from Sufism and other forms of mysticism like Mahayana and Zen Buddhism. Structurally, the plays are inspired by Japanese Noh theatre and Brecht's epic theatre. The Mahachaitra controversy Mahachaitra was prescribed as a textbook for undergraduate courses in three universities of Karnataka. In 1995, nearly a decade after its publication, when it was prescribed as a textbook in Gulbarga University, it caused a heated controversy. A section of Lingayats under the leadership of the nun Shri Shri Jagadguru Mate Mahadevi accused the work of portraying Basavanna in poor light and urged the Government of Karnataka to ban the play. It led to a legal battle and the play was eventually withdrawn from the university syllabus.Vijayakumar M. Boratti, \\"Understanding Collective Interpretation\\" in Journal of Karnataka Studies, Vol.2, No. 1, p.13-51. Also see relevant reports in the 1995 issues of Kannada Prabha, Prajavani and Deccan Herald The Mahachaitra controversy seems to have inspired Githa Hariharan's English novel In Times of Siege (2003), which narrates the story of a professor in an open university in Delhi, who finds himself in the midst of a controversy over a chapter on Basavanna which he wrote for an undergraduate textbook.

This led to visits to the area by Queen Victoria's son Edward, first as Prince of Wales and later as King Edward VII, usually in connection with a race meeting such as the St Leger.

Only the section between Ollerton and Farnsfield was built. The southern section to Bestwood Park was completed in the 1950s to serve the new Calverton Colliery. Further eastwards the line climbed at around 1-in-150 towards Boughton as it crossed a ridge before the valley of the River Trent.

It has since been razed to the ground. Context The station was opened by the LD&ECR; on its main line from to Lincoln. The LD&ECR; was taken over by the GCR in 1907 and subsequently became part of the LNER in 1923 then British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. The platforms were wooden, similar to the high level platforms at Dukeries Junction. The stationmaster's house was characteristic of the line, but the station buildings were not, they appear to have been made of wood,Station photos Picture the Past but on another page Dow himself says otherwise. The line crossed a series of ridges between river valleys. From Ollerton it climbed at around 1 in 150 to Boughton after which it descended to Tuxford Central heading towards the River Trent. Former Services There never was a Sunday service at Boughton. In 1922 three trains per day plied between Chesterfield Market Place and Lincoln with a market day extra on Fridays between Langwith Junction and Lincoln. All these trains called at all stations, though on the Friday extra Boughton was a request stop. From 1951 trains stopped running through to Chesterfield, turning back at Langwith Junction instead. Otherwise the same pattern continued until the last train on 17 September 1955. Coal The Wigan Coal and Iron Company intended to open a new colliery at Bevercotes and the LD&ECR; obtained powers to build a branch from Boughton sidings. It did not materialise and for many years the branch terminated at a set of buffers in the countryside. The colliery was opened in 1965 and the stub of line finally came into use. During World War II a connection was made to serve Boughton Ordnance Depot which had a large contingent of American service personnel. Modern Times The line through Boughton Station was reopened to non-passenger traffic in August 2009 as the High Marnham Test Track. The line is used by Network Rail to test new engineering trains and on-track plant. The new test line runs from Thoresby Colliery Junction to the site of the partially demolished High Marnham Power Station, and passes former station sites of Ollerton, Boughton, Tuxford Central and Dukeries Junction, all these stations were closed by 1955.

He is easily conflated with a contemporary Dominican, Tancred Tancredi, and the two are sometimes indistinguishable in the sources and have been treated as one person, though this is known to be false. Tancred's origins lie in Germany, where, if his hagiographers are to be believed, he was a soldier of middle rank at the court of the Emperor Frederick II. He was educated under John of Wales at the University of Bologna. He wrote an important gloss on the Compilatio tertia and the Summa de matrimonio (Summary of Marriage), which was influential to Ramon de Penyafort, as well as the Ordo iudiciarius, completed in 1216, which was the culmination of the procedural literature of the glossators and was translated into both German and French, indicating its importance for medieval legal practice.Rosamond McKitterick et al., The New Cambridge Medieval History, vol. IV (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 136. He supported the emergent doctrine of Papal infallibility and the sect of the Humiliati. He was one of the teachers of Bernard of Botone.

Recording The album marked the group's second collaboration with Tony Visconti after working together on The No Comprendo. The entire album was remixed by Jesse Johnson, though only his mixes of \\"Tongue Dance\\", \\"Singing in the Shower\\", and \\"Live in Las Vegas\\" were used. In an effort to appeal to Anglophone audiences the group collaborated with the American duo Sparks.

Russell Mael also appeared on the Les Rita Mitsouko composition and album opener \\"Hip Kit\\". Music and themes Marc & Robert displays a notable shift into a greater electronic emphasis, with sequencers and keyboards driving tracks while acoustic instruments are often absent. The album features a mixture of songs with lyrical themes that range from light in tone (\\"Singing in the Shower\\") to more reflective and bitter-sweet. The single \\"Le Petit Train\\" (English translation: \\"The little train\\") is an example of a song that reflects the dual nature of the lyrics. The song is opens musically and lyrically in a light tone with an almost childish melody. As the song progresses, the lyrical themes turn to serious references such as the use of trains in the deportation of Ethnic minorities and political prisoners during the Holocaust. The music video directed by Jean Achache, conveys the song's disjointed tones by shifting between increasingly oppressive scenes often backed by fencing reminiscent of a concentration camp and a playful Bollywood homage that makes up the lighter sections. Singles \\"Mandolino City\\" was released as the first single in France and Germany. It was backed with the album track \\"Smog\\". \\"Singing in the Shower\\" was released as the second single and the first in UK and US. French versions were backed with the album track \\"Harpie and Harpo\\", the UK release included \\"Smog\\" most likely because of its English lyric. CD and twelve inch versions in France and internationally featured the Jesse Johnson remix of \\"Hip Kit\\". \\"Le Petit Train\\" was released as the third single in France. It was backed with the album-track \\"Petite Fille Princesse\\". \\"Tongue Dance\\" was remixed by William Orbit and Mark Moore and released as the second UK single, the French release followed almost a year later in 1990.

Career One of five brothers (four of whom at one period played together in the same Hunslet team), Goldthorpe made his first team d√©but with Hunslet, at , as a 16-year-old in October, 1888. He went on to become one of the best known figures in English rugby, both before and after the split, and he was one of the finest individual talents in the game at the time of the Northern Union's formation in 1895. He was also a successful cricketer, captaining the team for several years. Goldthorpe was still playing for Hunslet twenty years after his debut, when in the 1907-08 season he led the club to unprecedented success, winning all four cups (the Challenge Cup, the Championship, the Yorkshire Cup and the Yorkshire League). Hunslet were the first team to achieve that feat. Albert Goldthorpe played in Hunslet's 14-0 victory over Hull F.C. in the 1907‚Äì08 Challenge Cup Final during the 1907‚Äì08 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield on Saturday 25 April 1908, in front of a crowd of 18,000. Albert Goldthorpe played in Hunslet's 13-3 victory over Halifax in the 1905‚Äì06 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1905‚Äì06 season at Park Avenue, Bradford on Saturday 2 December 1905, and played , and scored 3-drop goals in the 17-0 victory over Halifax in the 1907‚Äì08 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1907‚Äì08 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 21 December 1907. When he finally retired in 1910, Goldthorpe had scored more goals and points than any player in the game's history at that time. He had played at least 713 games for Hunslet, scoring over 80 tries and kicking over 1000 goals. After his playing career ended he served on the Hunslet committee until, in 1924, he was appointed as the club's second full-time secretary- manager, a post he held for seven years. He had been a member of the committee from at least 15th Nov, 1895, along with his brother James. Albert farmed Urn Farm on Middleton Road, Belle Isle, Leeds and is buried in Hunslet Cemetery nearby. Joint Committee Minutes April 1889 to Aug 1908 = in possession of Hunslet RLFC Legacy Goldthorpe died in 1942 aged 72. In 1988 an Australian television movie, The First Kangaroos actor Dennis Waterman's villainous depiction of Goldthorpe drew formal complaints from Goldthorpe's granddaughter. In 2008, the Albert Goldthorpe Medal was created by British rugby league newspaper Rugby Leaguer & League Express to honour the leading players in the Super League.

Directed by Clarence Brown, the film stars Wallace Beery and features Lionel Barrymore, Eric Linden, Cecilia Parker, Spring Byington, and a young Mickey Rooney. Rooney stars as Nat in MGM's musical remake Summer Holiday (1948). Plot June 1906 in an unnamed New England town. 17-year-old Richard Miller is about to graduate and go to Yale. He already feels worldly wise, thanks to reading Shaw, Wilde, The Rub√°iy√°t of Omar Khayyam, Swinburne and Marxist tracts. He adores the neighborhood girl Muriel McComber, but she is afraid of being kissed. Richard‚Äôs father, newspaper editor Nat Miller, is a kind, wise man. Richard has three siblings: older brother Arthur home from Yale; sister, Mildred; and Tommy, the youngest. Uncle Sid and Cousin Lily live with the family. Sid keeps proposing to Lily, but she refuses, ostensibly because he once got involved with a bad woman; his not-so-secret drinking is the real problem. Sid travels to his new job in Waterbury. At graduation, Richard drops his valedictory speech and Nat reads it. Nat turns a burst of applause into a final acclamation, forestalling Richard‚Äôs planned Marxist call to arms. After the ceremony, Nat asks if Richard‚Äôs conscience will allow him to drive the family‚Äôs Stanley Steamer. Of course, he is thrilled and asks Muriel to come along. On the morning of the Fourth, the street explodes in fireworks. The fired Uncle Sid reappears, but says that he has the day off. Lily hints that she would accept a proposal now. Sid doesn‚Äôt act, and Lily is hurt. Muriel's father storms in, accusing Richard of corrupting his daughter's morals. He gives Nat the letters and a farewell letter from Muriel, then threatens to pull his advertising, and storms out. ‚ÄúSamples of the new freedom,‚Äù Nat says, showing Richard‚Äôs letters to Sid, who reads aloud a stanza from Swinburne‚Äôs Laus Veneris. He stops and they both read silently. ‚ÄúHail and Hallelujah!‚Äù Nat whispers.Sid reads aloud: ‚ÄúLips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown, Of one same fire and colour with their own. Then ere one sleep.. ‚Äú and stops. The rest is: ‚Äú... appeased with sacrifice, Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone.\\" However, he is truly concerned. He tells Richard about Macomber‚Äôs visit; Shocked, Richard reassures his father: He plans to marry Muriel. When Richard reads the letter, he is heartbroken: ‚ÄúGeewhillickers!‚Äù he sobs, and bursts into tears. Mildred goes to a box social, Nat and Sid go to a men‚Äôs club picnic, the women go to a hen party, and lovelorn Richard walks and walks. Arthur‚Äôs friend Wint asks Richard to go on a double date with ‚Äúa couple of swift babies‚Äù that night. The family reassembles at supper. Sid, who was given back his old job at Nat's newspaper, is drunk again and can barely stand. At the table, he has everyone laughing; but when he goes up for a nap, Lily says that they all encourage him ‚Äî and maybe they shouldn‚Äôt. Richard blames women for driving men to drink and marches out to meet Wint. In a hotel bar, Wint has disappeared and Richard is sitting with Belle, a floozy. His innocence is painfully obvious. At Belle‚Äôs nod, the bartender slips something into Richard‚Äôs sloe gin fizz. A customer tells the bartender that Richard is underage, he throws him out. When he learns he is the son of a newspaper editor, he throws Belle out. Richard comes home drunk and miserable, declaiming: \\"But he does not win who plays with Sin In the secret House of Shame.\\"Oscar Wilde, The Ballad of Reading Gaol Horrified, Essie assumes the worst. Sid takes charge. On the next evening, Muriel and Richard meet. She explains that her father made her write the letter. They finally kiss and Richard sighs, ‚ÄúGosh, I Love You.‚Äù Richard returns home, transported. \\"That‚Äôs love, not liquor\\", Nat reassures Essie. Nat and Richard have s serious talk, about the fact that \\"no woman wants to give her love to a stupid drunk\\" and about women like Bette, \\"whited sepulchers\\" who can \\"ruin your whole life.\\"This is a reference to syphilis, which was still a devastating, deadly and essentially incurable scourge when this film was made. It would be more than a decade before the widespread availability of penicillin after World War II made cures possible. Nat gives him a punishment that is no hardship‚Äîgo to Yale and stick with it. Sid and Lily are in the swing, drinking lemonade (Sid spikes it.) Mildred and Art are walking with their sweethearts. Macomber is reconciled. \\"We are completely surrounded by love,\\" Nat says. Richard kisses his parents and goes out to gaze blissfully at the moon. Nat quotes the Rubaiyat \\"‚ÄòAh, that Spring should vanish with the rose‚Äô...Spring isn‚Äôt everything\\", he says to Essie. \\"There‚Äôs a lot to be said for Autumn.. and Winter, if you‚Äôre together.\\" Cast * Wallace Beery as Sidney Miller * Lionel Barrymore as Nat Miller * Aline MacMahon as Lily Davis * Eric Linden as Richard 'Dick' Miller * Cecilia Parker as Muriel McComber * Spring Byington as Essie Miller * Mickey Rooney as Tommy Miller * Charley Grapewin as Mr. Dave McComber * Frank Albertson as Arthur Miller * Edward J.

Bergensbanen railway terminated at Gulsvik Station from 1908 until the line was completed in 1909. With its location at the top of Lake Kr√∏deren, Gulsvik was a key port on the lake. When the ferry over Lake Kr√∏deren was established, Gulsvik became the natural port on the northern side, with accommodations for tourism.Kr√∏deren Railway Hallingporten is a 65 m long tunnel on Norwegian National Road 7 (Riksvei 7) just north of Gulsvik. The tunnel has a distinctive shape. The reason for this is that the current road tunnel has been added where there was previously a tog tunnel. The Hallingporten upper level is thus the old tog tunnel. There were skirmishes here in April 1940 during the Fighting in Hallingdal. The name Gulsvik is connected to the original farm of Gulsvik. The Gulsvik farm was known from the middle ages, when the owners were among the most prominent people in lower Hallingdal. In the late middle ages, the owners of Gulsvik farm were noblemen in allegiance to the king of Norway. The old Gulsvik clan is said to be one of the most widespread families in lower Buskerud, descending from a Birkebeiner soldier in the service of King Sverre. Dating from 1430, the farm became divided, as time passed into upper, middle and lower Gulsvik (Gulsvik nordre, Gulsvik mellom and Gulsvik s√∏ndre). This area is called Gulsvik Farthing (Gulsvikfjerdingen) and contains a number of farms. The wider area south of Gulsvik was settled just as early, and the proper name of the area is Southern Fl√• Municipality, reckoned from the border of Kr√∏dsherad up to the end of Lake Kr√∏deren (Innsj√∏en Kr√∏deren). The Gulsvik Farthing is to the north, close up to Hallingdal gate, an entrance into the valley of Hallingdal.

He lives in Jerusalem and the United States. He has taught at Duke University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and Dartmouth College, and was director of the Zell Entrepreneurship Program at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya in Israel. From 1998 to 2001 he was International Director of Intellectual Capital at KPMG LLP. Before this he headed product development at Monitor Group, with which he is still associated. From 1986 to 1991 he was technology editor of Harvard Business Review. A Guggenheim Fellow, Avishai holds a doctorate in political economy from the University of Toronto. Before turning to management, he covered the Middle East as a journalist. He has written many articles and commentaries for The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, Harvard Business Review, Harper's Magazine and other publications. He is the author of three books on Israel, including the widely read The Tragedy of Zionism, and the 2008 The Hebrew Republic.  Academic career  Bernard Avishai was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1949. The son of the late Ben Shaicovitch, president of Canada's Zionist Men's Association during the 1950s, he volunteered for farm work on an Israeli collective during the Six-Day War, an experience that affected many of his generation. He and his first wife, the artist Susan Avishai, moved to Israel in 1972 while he was still working on a doctorate in political economy for the University of Toronto, and began writing about Israel, the history of Zionism, and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. After the October War of 1973, he published a series of searching political essays in The New York Review of Books, to which he contributed regularly until the mid-1980s. His reports anticipated the 1977 election that brought Menachem Begin and the Israeli right to power for a generation. Avishai earned his doctorate in 1978, writing mainly on the work of Hobbes and Marx under C. B. Macpherson. He moved to Boston in 1980, where he taught humanities at MIT, and joined Dissent magazine's editorial board. His first book, The Tragedy of Zionism, was published in 1985 to considerable controversy, since it suggested that Israel's occupation was a symptom of a democracy plagued by anachronistic Zionist institutions and ideas. The controversy led to his being denied tenure at MIT, according to Avishai, and he left for Harvard Business School in 1986. He there took up a position as an editor of Harvard Business Review (HBR). In 1987, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship for continuing work on the writer Arthur Koestler, which led to eventual articles in The New Yorker, Partisan Review, and Salmagundi. His second book, A New Israel, was published in 1990. Avishai was Visiting Professor at the Fuqua School of Business and Senior Fellow at the Sanford School of Public Policy at Duke University, where he taught courses on the new economy and public policy. Today, Avishai serves as a visiting professor specializing in political economy at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.  Business career  His years at HBR, where he became the magazine's technology and strategy editor, changed the direction of his work considerably. He brought to publication dozens of articles on computer-based manufacturing, the implications of burgeoning information networks, and globalization. While preparing to branch off into knowledge management consulting, he began to consider the implications of high technology for Israel's economy and society. In 1991, his last at HBR, he published \\"Israel's Future: Brainpower, High tech‚Äîand Peace\\" in the magazine, the first to predict Israel's economic opportunity. He then joined Monitor Group as its head of product development, and became International Director of Intellectual Capital at KPMG LLP in 1998. During these years in management consulting, he continued to contribute articles, mainly on Israeli politics and economy, to The New Yorker, The New York Times, The American Prospect, Fortune, and other magazines. He remains active as a consultant associated with Monitor Group, and has taught entrepreneurial business planning in Libya and other places under its auspices.  The Hebrew Republic  In 2002, he married Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, a professor of literature at the Hebrew University, and returned to Israel and teaching, becoming director of the Zell Entrepreneurship Program at Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya. In 2005, he wrote the widely cited article \\"Saving Israel from Itself\\" in Harper's Magazine, which led to the book The Hebrew Republic. This book argues that Israel's professional elites have made a success of globalization, and have become a natural constituency for a successful peace process; but that Israeli democracy's continuing neglect of its Arab minority, now 1/5 of the country, and the special privileges accorded to Israel's ultra-Orthodox, also 1/5 of the country, is sowing the seeds of a disaster which only a settlement with the Palestinians can prevent. As he puts it in his book, \\"Israel cannot have an economy like Singapore's through a nationalities war like Serbia's.\\" Personal life Avishai is married to Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi. He is the father of three children. He divides his time between homes in Jerusalem and Wilmot, New Hampshire.
