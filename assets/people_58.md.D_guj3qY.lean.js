It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. The mountain is situated in the Pasayten Wilderness, on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher neighbor is Wildcat Mountain, to the east-southeast, and Slate Peak is set to the south. Pasayten Peak is the high point of Gold Ridge, and precipitation runoff from this peak drains into the West and Middle Forks of Pasayten River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences higher precipitation than the east side, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He was a disciple of Louis Cattiaux.  Biography  Childhood and youth = The eldest of a family of six children, son of Victor van der Linden d'Hooghvorst (1878‚Äì1942) and Marthe Descantons de Montblanc (1887‚Äì1978), Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst was born in Brussels on 30 April 1914. He did his Greek-Latin humanities at Cardinal Mercier College in Braine-l‚ÄôAlleud where he became a friend of the Russian- born future painter Nicolas de Sta√´l. He then studied philosophy at the Catholic University of Louvain.J.-P. Deschepper, P. Seys, \\"Chronique de l'Institut Sup√©rieur de Philosophie\\", Revue philosophique de Louvain, vol. 91, no. 92, Louvain, Peeters, November 1993, p. 715 onwards. Nicolas de Sta√´l described Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst as his best friend. In 1935 the two of them made a four-month trip to Spain: \\"They stay with the locals: Nicolas pays with drawings and Emmanuel by washing dishes.\\" D'Hooghvorst then spent a year in the Belgian Congo as a gold prospector. Perhaps this is where he became interested, if not in alchemy, at least in chrysopoeia. Manifesto against L√©on Degrelle, written by Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst In April 1936, as a Catholic member of the movement Action Nouvelle, he published a violent pamphlet against L√©on Degrelle ‚Äì J‚Äôaccuse L√©on Degrelle ‚Äì intended to reveal the intentions of rexism. He wrote: \\"The rexist campaign is a terrible exploitation of popular credulity. However, the public must be aware of Rex‚Äôs leader‚Äôs true personality, of his latest intentions and of the means he uses to achieve them.\\" During the Spanish Civil War, he was a war correspondent for the Belgian daily La Libre Belgique. In 1939, he married Countess Elisabeth de Marnix de Sainte Aldegonde, who gave birth to four children. = Beginning of his hermetic research = Under the German occupation of Belgium in World War II, he was imprisoned twice by the Gestapo and then released. At that time he began to study classical literature in depth, especially Neoplatonism and Pythagorism. He often confessed later to his relatives that if he was not executed, as many of his friends involved in the Resistance were, it was because he had immersed himself in these studies.Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst, Lettre in√©dite au professeur St√©phane Feye In 1949, he discovered the Message retrouv√©, the masterpiece of the Hermetic painter Louis Cattiaux (published in 1946 at the author‚Äôs expense, with a preface by Lanza del Vasto) thanks to a criticism by Ren√© Gu√©non. In issue 270 of the journal √âtudes Traditionnelles in 1948, Gu√©non defined it as a work of hermeticism that ‚Äúdeserves to be read and studied with care by all those who are interested in this particular aspect of tradition‚Äù. This discovery led him to contact Louis Cattiaux by making an appointment at his home at 3, rue Casimir P√©rier in Paris, ‚Äúsitting between his wife and his cat‚Äù as Lanza del Vasto nicely wrote in the above- mentioned Pr√©face. Their first interview almost never took place: Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst showed up at Cattiaux‚Äôs on time, apologising for not being able to receive him, as he had to go to a so-called ‚ÄúBoard of Directors‚Äù; however, he allowed him to go, while waiting for his return, to grind coffee near his wife Henriette in the kitchen. When he returned, Cattiaux immediately addressed him: \\"Are you still there? You‚Äôre not too bad for a Belgian!\\" Charles d‚ÄôHooghvorst later wrote of Cattiaux: \\"Disconcerting, with unpredictable reactions, guided by a particular logic that caught his visitors off guard, he liked to shock and even scandalise, but always with humour.\\" This was the beginning of a friendship nourished by an intense epistolary relationship between Cattiaux and the two brothers, Emmanuel and Charles d'Hooghvorst. They sometimes wrote each other several letters a day. A good part of these voluminous written exchanges were published by Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst in an anthology in the Belgian review Le Fil d‚ÄôAriane (see below). He classified and titled them by theme (not chronologically) under the title of Floril√®ge Catt√©sien. Professor Raimon Arola published the entire anthology in Castilian translation, first in 1999 in Tarragona, then in 2006 under the title Florilegio Epistolar, Reflejos de una busqueda alqu√≠mica (Epistolary anthology, reflections on an alchymical quest). Finally, this anthology again be published in French in 2006. In this fourth edition, Professor Arola states: \\"This relationship hides much more than it appears. We find an unusual and surprising story, like a miracle that occurred in the heart of the twentieth century.\\" He also evokes \\"a friendship like those told in heroic epics in the past, which were at the origin of the great exploits performed by mortals with the help of the gods\\". As for Lanza del Vasto, the first prefacer of Cattiaux's work, although he remained a friend of all three, he was more concerned about a social mission, which led him to the foundation of the Community of the Ark. Cattiaux, shortly before his death, wrote to Charles on 9 March 1953: \\"As for Lanza, you now understand the drama! It is Emmanuel and you who received the Message retrouv√© that he did not want, and who present it in his place because he feared he would no longer be a master.\\" However, this did not prevent Lanza del Vasto from remaining faithful and participating in Rhisnes (near Namur) in 1973, together with Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst, in a meeting devoted to the Message retrouv√© in the home of Professor S. Feye who, at the time, tried to found a community based on the Community of the Ark. Thus, as Didier Kahn points out, Cattiaux, like Fulcanelli and Eug√®ne Canseliet, \\"also gave birth to a whole school around his disciples Charles and Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst\\". The two brothers decided very early on to do everything possible to ensure that their friend's Message retrouv√© was successfully reissued, and in its entirety this time. Indeed, in its first edition of 1946, the book contained only 12 chapters, divided into verses. However, Cattiaux continually amplified it until \\"book\\" 40 (new denomination of the old chapters) which he left unfinished at his unexpected death. This publication had benefited from the reputation of Lanza del Vasto, which was constantly increasing. Indeed, the foundation in La Borie Noble (H√©rault department) of the Community of the Ark, Lanza's numerous trips and conferences throughout the world, his struggle for non-violence in the mind of his master Gandhi, and especially his numerous publications, ensured a relative success for the Message retrouv√© that Lanza prefaced. However, this preface, although skilfully written, is far from being Lanza del Vasto's best- known text. Many of Lanza's disciples are unaware of its existence. As for the praise of the Message retrouv√© that Ren√© Gu√©non published (see above), it had a dark side: if it increased the audience in certain circles (metaphysicists, occultists, hermeticists, alchemists etc.), Gu√©non also aroused violent oppositions and had many enemies in both Catholic and esoteric circles. The question was of interest to Cattiaux who, during a long three-year correspondence with Gu√©non, tried to convince him to write an introduction to this future edition of the Message retrouv√©. It is also in this letter that we can read the change of perspective that finally made Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst the presenter of the book: \\"As for knowing if your [Gu√©non's] name will do me good or harm in these circles, it is the least of my concerns, believe me. Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst found here something else that interested him more than all the lodges combined [‚Ä¶].\\"Paris - Le Caire, √âditions du Miroir d'Isis, Ways, octobre 2011, 138 p. , p. 113. In any case, Ren√© Gu√©non's death on January 7, 1951, ended the project. = Life as a Writer and Translator = In 1951, Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst wrote his first article on the Message retrouv√©, published in Lausanne in issue 6 of the Swiss journal Les Cahiers trimestriels Inconnues. Already in issue 5 of this journal, he published the article entitled \\"Essai sur l'Art d'Alchymie\\". From the first page of this essay, Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst asked a fundamental question about the countless books on alchemy: \\"We can ask ourselves, however, when reading these books, whether we are dealing with charlatans hiding their ignorance under the appearance of pretentious jargon, or with sages jealously hiding their knowledge under the thorns of an obscure style in order to test the wisdom and constancy of the reader. Both hypotheses are true.\\" In July 1953, Cattiaux died suddenly. The two brothers were redoubling their efforts in their editorial decision. Already during their friend‚Äôs lifetime, they distributed among their relatives booklets of verses from the Message retrouv√©, typed and copied with a stencil. \\"When Louis Cattiaux died, the d‚ÄôHooghvorst brothers tried, by all means, to publish the complete edition of the Message retrouv√©. In spring 1956, after long and costly negotiations, a full edition was published.\\" As early as 1954, Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst published an article in Volume 9 of the Swiss journal Inconnues: \\"Le Message proph√©tique de Louis Cattiaux\\". In parallel with this desire to spread Cattiaux's work, Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst continued his in-depth studies of the original treatises on hermeticism and alchemy. Most of these were written in Greek or Latin,For the Greek treatises, see M. Berthelot, Collection des Alchimistes grecs, Paris, ed. Georges Steinheil, Paris, 1888, or the volumes Les Alchimistes grecs in the series Les Belles Lettres . For the Latin treatises, we mostly have the Theatrum chemicum published by the Zetzner's heirs in Argentoratum (Strasbourg) in 1659 (6 volumes) and the Bibliotheca chemica curiosa of doctor Manget, among Detournes & Co, Geneva, 1702. This is list is far from being complete; see for instance, Alchimie, Cr√©dit Communal de Belgique, 1984, 448 pages. except a few such as the voluminous production of Paracelsus (most of whose treatises are in Middle High German) and the two volumes of Nicolas Salmon-Mangin de Richebourg's Biblioth√®que des philosophes chimiques (in French). Being aware that the public of researchers was less and less trained in this cursive reading, he published in 1955, in issue 11 of Inconnues, his own French translation of Chapter IV of the Hydrolithus Sophicus seu Aquarium Sapientium (The Water Stone of Wisdom or the Aquarium of the Wise) attributed to Johann Ambrosius Siebmacher, an author who lived in Nuremberg and Augsburg in the seventeenth century. In his preface, he wrote: \\"Wanting to reach the secret of the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone, without divine blessing, is a dangerous folly; it would be equally vain, moreover, to seek to penetrate the books of the Hermetic Philosophers, the only true ones, without first resorting to the light of the Holy Scriptures, of which they are in a way the experimentation and the confirmation in the physical nature.\\"\\"La Pierre aqueuse de sagesse ou l'Aquarium des Sages\\", Revue Inconnues, no. 11, Lausanne, 1955, p. 89. It was also under his impetus that the book was published in 1989 in full by the publishing house La Table d‚Äô√âmeraude in Paris, in Claude Froidebise's French translation: \\"It is [d'Hooghvorst] who proposed us to complete his work and who gave us all his help and corrected many passages that were too imprecise, giving the text back its meaning.\\" Eager to study the sacred scriptures of all nations, Emmanuel d'Hooghvorst decided to take classes with a Parisian rabbi, Jo√´l Ashkenazi, professor of Philosophy, in order to learn Hebrew and Aramaic; he also studied Arabic at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles. In turn, he provided free classes to small groups of friends in Hebrew grammar, and then the texts of the Hebrew Kabbalah (excerpts from Ashlag's Zohar, Tishby's Mishnat Hazohar, Midrash Rabba, Midrash Hagadol, Talmud, etc.). In 1958, he wrote an \\"Introduction √† Eug√®ne Philal√®the\\" (alias Thomas Vaughan) for the Trait√© du Ciel terrestre, which his friend Armand Deruyt had just translated for the journal Inconnues, making it a pioneering work.Cf. Introduction de Didier Kahn in: The book was published in two parts in 1958 and 1960. This introduction was reproduced as it stands by Cl√©ment Rosereau in his edition of Thomas Vaughan's Complete Works just a few days after the death of Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst. Before beginning his own preface, Cl√©ment Rosereau explains: ‚ÄúIt was he who made us discover and love Thomas Vaughan and who, through his enlightened advice and benevolent patience, guided and helped us in this work of many years [‚Ä¶]. Baron d‚ÄôHooghvorst was able to detect in Eugenius Philalethes an exceptional perfume, that of the last Adept that the West would have known.‚Äù In 1977, the journal Le Fil d‚ÄôAriane, √âcriture et tradition, dealing with religions and hermeticism, was founded by Jean-Marie d‚ÄôAnsembourg. It regularly hosted articles by Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst. The same was true of the Spanish journal La Puerta, Retorno a las fuentes tradicionales. Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst also wrote in the French alchemical journal La Tourbe des Philosophes. From 1975 until his death, Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst wrote numerous articles and sometimes gave lectures.For instance: ¬´ L'Astrologie dans l'Antiquit√© ¬ª, lecture given on 15 December at the Soci√©t√© Th√©osophique, at ¬´ L'Atelier ¬ª, 51, rue du Commerce, in Brussels, whose text was included in the expanded edition of the Fil de P√©n√©lope, vol. II, in 2019. In 1992, for example, he presented Les Cinq Livres ou La Clef du Secret des Secrets by Nicolas Valois in a style that some would describe as ‚Äúinspired‚Äù and which, in any case, clearly changes tone, going from an academic style to a resolutely more poetic tone:. ‚ÄúMay this Saturn bind you to the pot if you have grasped this mercury that one cannot read without cooking it. This text has two sides, indeed, one of which is blessed; the other is merely a mask in which an idol is read. If you bind the study to your head, your gold will dissipate without profit: it is to toil that you must bind your reading‚Ä¶‚Äù This often mysterious and unusual style will be found here and there in most of his commentaries, and will culminate in his Aphorisms of the New World (see below). Touching on seemingly disparate subjects such as Homer‚Äôs Odyssey, the Aeneid or the Bucolics of Virgil, the Tarot deck, Perrault‚Äôs Tales, Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy, Ovid‚Äôs King Midas, and, of course, the texts of the Jewish Kabbalah and alchemical writings, he commented on them all, in his own words, in the hermetic sense based on a unique experience. These articles therefore take their place among the texts of Western hermeticism. His distinctly ‚Äúcabalistic‚Äù approach to Miguel de Cervantes‚Äô novel Don Quixote inspired, for example, Pere S√°nchez Ferr√©‚Äôs Cervantes‚Äô study of Cervantes, subtitled C√°bala y alquimia en el Quijote, which the author dedicates to Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst. As for its influence on alchemical studies in particular, Raimon Arola highlights it in the introduction to his book Alquimia y religi√≥n: ‚ÄúThis was the original intention of Baron d‚ÄôHooghvorst, which we will use as a starting point for our reflections.‚Äù The same author quotes extensively from the articles of E. d‚ÄôHooghvorst in his voluminous La C√°bala y la alquimia. In her Trece F√°bulas alqu√≠micas, Luisa Vert pays homage to him in turn: ‚ÄúEmmanuel van der Linden d‚ÄôHooghvorst (1914‚Äì1999) was a profound connoisseur of Western spirituality, who devoted many of his essays to the art of alchemy. It was undoubtedly his writings that aroused my interest in this fascinating discipline.‚Äù In 2018, in his doctoral thesis entitled M√°gica Belleza, the art historian Roger Ferrer Ventosa wrote: ‚ÄúOn this idea [the corporification of the mind], d‚ÄôHooghvorst, lover of alchemy, remarked: ‚ÄòTo give body and measure to immensity is the mystery of pure Art.‚Äô‚Äù Poster announcing in 1998 the publication of Le Fil de P√©n√©lope, volume 2. Generally speaking, the influence exerted by these articles is such that, on the subject of ‚Äútruths of a physical and metaphysical nature‚Äù, the philosopher Mohammed Taleb says: ‚ÄúThese truths will be perceived throughout the centuries, from Plutarch (42‚Äì120) to Clement of Alexandria (150‚Äì220), from Michael Psellos (1018‚Äì1078) to Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst (1904‚Äì1999).‚Äù ‚ÄúThis was the patient quest of Baron d‚ÄôHooghvorst, a scholar in Ancient Letters, scrutinising the words of the Sacred and Wise Scriptures as if they were sealed boxes. Did he find the magical secret that unveils the secret of the buried Man? For it is indeed the mystery of Nature and Man that is at stake here, and not an external and speculative erudition.‚Äù Emmanuel d‚ÄôHooghvorst was also in epistolary contact with personalities such as Henry Corbin, Roch Boulvin, Lanza del Vasto, Jos√© Gifreda, Georges Finet, Pere Ribot i Sunyer, Jean Mallinger, Gustave Lambert Brahy, √âmile Dantinne, Marcel De Corte, Alexander von Bernus, Serge Mayassis, etc. In a letter to Bernard Chauvi√®re, a disciple and friend of Eug√®ne Canseliet, he wrote: ‚ÄúYes, Canseliet was right to tell us that the imperious need to work was a kind of grace [‚Ä¶].

The collection, which featured many prominent American artists and works, including Emanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware, remained intact following his 1880 death until it was auctioned off in 1897. History Roberts was a noted art collector and staunch supporter of American artists who never sold or exchanged a painting after he bought it. He was considered the prototypical New York patron, like Gilpin in Philadelphia and Harrison Gray Otis in Boston. He \\"made no pretensions to connoisseurship, but was guided in his purchases simply by fancy, or with a view to assisting some needy artist.\\" Roberts served on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Board of Trustees in 1870 and 1871, and lent some of his paintings to the Metropolitan Fair Picture Gallery in 1864 held at the Fourteenth Street Armory. Roberts formed his collection of 335 paintings at a time when the D√ºsseldorf School of German genre paintings were the fashion and the canvases which told human stories were most worthy of attention. His best-known acquisition is Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, which he bought for $10,000 (at the time, an enormous sum). Roberts built an art gallery, attached to his home, 107 Fifth Avenue (at the southeast corner of 18th Street), where he displayed his collection, which included Rembrandt Peale's Babes in the Wood, Daniel Huntington's Venice, Good Samaritan and Old Lawyer, Frederick Stuart Church's Rainy Season in the Tropics and Coast of Maine, R√©gis Fran√ßois Gignoux's Hawk's Nest, West Virginia, Richard Caton Woodville's War News from Mexico, Asher Brown Durand's Indian Rescue, Schaeffele's Marie de Medici's Visit to Ruben's Studio, Johann Georg Meyer's First Lesson, Constant Troyon's After the Hunt, Paul Falconer Poole's Pension Agent, Charles Verlat's Sheep in Pasture, Paul Delaroche's Napoleon at Fontainbleau, Ernest Meissonier's The Smoker (1849) Thomas Sidney Cooper's Monarch of the Plain, √âdouard Fr√®re's Mother and Infant and The Industrious Mother, John Frederick Kensett's Noon by the Sea Shore and Franconia Notch, Henry Peters Gray's Rose of Fiesole and Just Fifteen, George A. Baker's Love at First Sight, Wild Flowers and Children of the Wood, John George Brown's His First Cigar, Thomas Cole's Old Mill, James McDougal Hart's Old Homestead and Morning in the Adirondacks, William Henry Powell's Landing of the Pilgrims, William Sidney Mount's Raffling for a Goose, Robert Swain Gifford's On The St. Lawrence and View of Quebec, Eugene Benson's Thoughts in Exile, Thomas Sully's Woman at the Well and A Girl Offering Flowers at a Shrine, Seymour Joseph Guy's A Field Daisy and Good Sister, Charles Loring Elliott's Portrait of Himself, and George Henry Boughton's Gypsy Women, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me's The Egyptian Conscript, James Augustus Suydam's On the Beach, Charles Baugniet's Dressing for the Ball, Benjamin Vautier's The Letter, as well as works by M. H. Koekkoek √âdouard Detaille. In addition to the 1876 Indian Vase by his son-in-law Ames Van Wart, Roberts collection included a 1,000 different numbers in bronze, art objects and furnishings. His sculptures included Erastus Dow Palmer's medallion base- reliefs Night and Morning, Franklin Simmons's The Promised Land, and Voso's Cupid and Psyche. =Auction of collection= Roberts died on September 11, 1880 while in Saratoga, New York. The entire collection was left to his widow, the former Sarah Lawrence \\"Susan\\" Endicott. At the time of his death, it was reported that he had spent $600,000 () on the collection which was then worth over $750,000 (). In 1892, Susan remarried to Ralph Vivian of Claverton Manor They moved to London and the collection remained in the Fifth Avenue home, which remained unoccupied other then the winter of 1893 to 1894 when Cornelius and Alice Gwynne Vanderbilt leased the mansion while they were expanded their chateau at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. In 1897, Susan hired Messrs. Ortgies & Co. of the Fifth Avenue Art Galleries, under the management of Samuel P. Avery, Jr., to auction off the entire collection. The auction of the paintings took place at Chickering Hall on the evenings of January 19, 20, and 21, 1897. The statuary, art objects, and other furnishings were auctioned off from the Fifth Avenue home on January 18 and 22. In total, $41,754 () was received for the sale of 172 pictures, $8,764 during the first night's sale and $32,990 the following night at Chickering Hall. The Roberts home on Fifth Avenue was sold and in July 1901, architect Robert Maynicke filed plans for a new eleven-story building to be erected by Henry Corn on the site of home. The new building, extant today at 105 Fifth Avenue, was original location of the Barnes & Noble chain of bookstores from 1932 to 2014.

The initial $82-billion aid package was announced on March 18, 2020 by Justin Trudeau. The first measures were implemented when the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act received royal assent from Governor General Julie Payette on March 25, 2020. Modifications to existing programs Existing federal social security programs were modified to provide additional financial support to their recipients. Canada Child Benefit payments were given a one-time increase of $300 per child, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) credit for the 2019 tax year was doubled, and personal income tax deadlines for 2019 were extended. Catherine McKenna, the Minister of Infrastructure and Communities, also announced on April 16 that the federal government was seeking \\"shovel-ready\\" infrastructure projects to receive stimulus funding. Income support programs The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB; ) is a program which provides a taxable benefit of per month for Canadian residents facing unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially announced as providing a maximum of four months' financial support, the federal government announced a further two months of support in June 2020 and another month in August 2020. The benefit is jointly administered by Employment and Social Development Canada and the Canada Revenue Agency, with eligible persons either applying through ESDC's Service Canada online portal or through the CRA online portal. To be eligible, applicants must attest they: did not quit their job voluntarily, earned at least in the 2019 tax year or the preceding 12 months, have stopped working or are working reduced hours due to COVID-19, and are earning less than in employment or self-employment income. Within one week of the CERB program's launch in April 2020, nearly 3.5 million Canadians applied for this benefit; this grew to 7.12 million by April 24. On April 15, eligibility for CERB was expanded to include seasonal workers, persons who had exhausted their Employment Insurance regular or sickness benefits, and those who have returned to work but still earn less than per month due to reduced hours or lower demand. Due to the lack of summer employment available for post-secondary students or graduating high school students, the Canadian government introduced the Canada Emergency Student Benefit (CESB; ) as a counterpart to CERB to help students. Students who cannot find employment or are unable to work due to the COVID-19 pandemic are eligible for CA$1,250 per month from May through August 2020. CESB applicants with a disability or caring for dependents receive an additional $750, increasing their monthly amount to the equivalent of a CERB payment. Employment minister Carla Qualtrough announced on July 31, 2020 that the CERB would be wound down following a final extension of one month. CERB recipients who are still unemployed will be transitioned to the regular Employment Insurance system and those who do not qualify for EI will be transitioned into one of three new recovery benefit programs. CERB was ended on September 26, 2020, and a revamped EI program was implemented. On October 12, 2020, the federal government rolled out a new income support program, the Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) which pays $500 per week for up to 26 weeks; over 240,000 Canadians applied to the program on its first day of launching. Another program, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB) supports Canadians that have been working but have to take a break to care for dependents (a child below 12 years of age or a disabled family member). The benefit only applies if schools and care centres are closed, or the dependent fell sick, or contracted COVID-19. Canada Emergency Business Account The Canada Emergency Business Account (CEBA; ) provides emergency interest-free loans to small businesses and nonprofit organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this program is to ensure that these businesses have access to sufficient capital to remain solvent during the pandemic. CEBA was implemented in the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, No. 2 which was introduced by Finance Minister Bill Morneau and passed in Parliament on April 11, 2020. The budget for the program was set for , offering loans of financed by Export Development Canada. Businesses apply for CEBA loans through their current financial institution, which administer the loan and submit required information to EDC. Businesses that repay at least 75% of the loan balance () by December 31, 2022 will have any remaining balance forgiven. The size of the loans could be increased, along with the amount forgivable. The due date could also be moved into 2024 if need be. Canada Student Service Grant The Canada Student Service Grant (CSGS; ) provides paid service opportunities for young adults to assist with charities and non-profit organizations. Participants in the program must be 30 years old or under, recent post-secondary graduates (December 2019 or later) or enrolled in spring, summer or fall 2020 semester. For every 100 hours volunteered, the participant will receive $1000. Each participant may receive up to $5000 grant. Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS; ) is a program created by the Government of Canada to provide financial support for businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent large layoffs. CEWS allows eligible employers to receive a 75% subsidy on each of their employees' wages (up to their first $58,700) for 12 weeks retroactive to March 15. The CEWS is targeted \\"at businesses with revenue declines of at least 15 per cent in March, and 30 per cent in May and June.\\" The program was announced on 1 April 2020, as an expanded version of a previously proposed temporary wage subsidy. The Parliament of Canada reconvened on 11 April 2020 to pass the COVID-19 Emergency Response Act, No. 2 . Several large employers which had laid off employees due to the economic effects of the pandemic announced they would re- hire workers in response to CEWS. Air Canada announced because of the CEWS it would re-hire (backdated to 15 March) 16,000 airline staff that were laid off due to the pandemic. Business Credit Availability Program This programme, which was announced on 11 May 2020, consists of guaranteed loans at commercial rates of between $6-80 million. It had seen as of mid-June 2020 only 400 applications. It is administered by Export Development Canada and the Business Development Bank of Canada, Mary Ng, the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade is responsible for this programme. Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility The Large Employer Emergency Financing Facility (LEEFF; ) provides government-backed bridge financing to large Canadian employers through the Canada Development Investment Corporation (CDEV). On 11 May 2020, Trudeau, Morneau and Bains in a press conference said that \\"a bridge financing facility for large employers that need help to get through the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus.\\" One stated goal was \\"to avoid bankruptcies of otherwise viable firms wherever possible... Companies that use the lending facility will have to commit to respect collective bargaining agreements, protecting workers‚Äô pensions, and support national climate goals. Rules on access to the money will place limits on dividends, share buy-backs and executive pay.\\" The LEEFF will only target companies with annual revenues in excess of $300 million, and only if they request $60 million or more from the LEEFF. Under the LEEFF companies must also: limit executive salaries to $1 million per annum; provide a share in their business to CDEV through stock warrants; and prohibit dividends and share buybacks until they pay back their LEEFF. Enforcement On June 2, 2020, the Canada Revenue Agency announced a tip line for reporting suspected fraudulent CERB recipients. As of June 3, the CRA announced it had received 600 tips and had received 190,000 voluntary repayments of CERB from Canadians who were not entitled to receive them. On June 8, legislation was proposed by the Liberal government that would allow persons found to have received CERB payments fraudulently be subject to fines or imprisonment. The proposed legislation was not supported by any of the opposition parties in the minority Parliament and did not move ahead to second reading. Financial impacts of aid programs Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux issued a report on April 30, 2020 projecting the federal deficit for fiscal year 2020 could be in excess of $252 billion, based on nearly $146 billion in spending on federal aid measures. In a fiscal update tabled to on July 8, Minister of Finance Bill Morneau projected that the deficit for the 2020 fiscal year will reach $343.2 billion.

CP-PLL allows to quickly lock onto the phase of the incoming signal, achieving low steady state phase error. Phase-frequency detector (PFD) Phase- frequency detector dynamics Phase-frequency detector (PFD) is triggered by the trailing edges of the reference (Ref) and controlled (VCO) signals. The output signal of PFD i(t) can have only three states: 0, +I_p, and -I_p. A trailing edge of the reference signal forces the PFD to switch to a higher state, unless it is already in the state +I_p. A trailing edge of the VCO signal forces the PFD to switch to a lower state, unless it is already in the state -I_p. If both trailing edges happen at the same time, then the PFD switches to zero. Mathematical models of CP-PLL A first linear mathematical model of second-order CP-PLL was suggested by F. Gardner in 1980. A nonlinear model without the VCO overload was suggested by M. van Paemel in 1994 and then refined by N. Kuznetsov et al. in 2019. The closed form mathematical model of CP-PLL taking into account the VCO overload is derived in. These mathematical models of CP-PLL allow to get analytical estimations of the hold-in range (a maximum range of the input signal period such that there exists a locked state at which the VCO is not overloaded) and the pull-in range (a maximum range of the input signal period within the hold-in range such that for any initial state the CP-PLL acquires a locked state). =Continuous time linear model of the second order CP-PLL and Gardner's conjecture= Gardner‚Äôs analysis is based on the following approximation: time interval on which PFD has non-zero state on each period of reference signal is :t_p = \\\\theta_e/\\\\omega_{\\\\rm ref},\\\\ \\\\theta_e = \\\\theta_{\\\\rm ref} - \\\\theta_{\\\\rm vco}. Then averaged output of charge-pump PFD is :i_d = I_p \\\\theta_e/2\\\\pi with corresponding transfer function :I_d(s) = I_p\\\\theta_e(s)/2\\\\pi Using filter transfer function F(s) = R + \\\\frac{1}{Cs} and VCO transfer function \\\\theta_{\\\\rm vco}(s) = K_{\\\\rm vco}I_d(s)F(s)/s one gets Gardner's linear approximated average model of second-order CP-PLL : \\\\frac{\\\\theta_e(s)}{\\\\theta_{\\\\rm ref}(s)} = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi s}{2\\\\pi s + K_{\\\\rm vco}I_p\\\\left(R + \\\\frac{1}{Cs}\\\\right)}. In 1980, F. Gardner, based on the above reasoning, conjectured that transient response of practical charge-pump PLL's can be expected to be nearly the same as the response of the equivalent classical PLL (Gardner's conjecture on CP-PLL). Following Gardner's results, by analogy with the Egan conjecture on the pull- in range of type 2 APLL, Amr M. Fahim conjectured in his book that in order to have an infinite pull-in(capture) range, an active filter must be used for the loop filter in CP-PLL (Fahim-Egan's conjecture on the pull-in range of type II CP-PLL). =Continuous time nonlinear model of the second order CP-PLL= Without loss of generality it is supposed that trailing edges of the VCO and Ref signals occur when the corresponding phase reaches an integer number. Let the time instance of the first trailing edge of the Ref signal is defined as t = 0. The PFD state i(0) is determined by the PFD initial state i(0-), the initial phase shifts of the VCO \\\\theta_{vco}(0) and Ref \\\\theta_{ref}(0) signals. The relationship between the input current i(t) and the output voltage v_F(t) for a proportionally integrating (perfect PI) filter based on resistor and capacitor is as follows : \\\\begin{align} v_F(t) = v_c(0) + Ri(t) + \\\\frac{1}{C}\\\\int\\\\limits_0^t i(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau \\\\end{align} where R>0 is a resistance, C>0 is a capacitance, and v_c(t) is a capacitor charge. The control signal v_F(t) adjusts the VCO frequency: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot\\\\theta_{vco}(t) = \\\\omega_{vco}(t) = \\\\omega_{vco}^{\\\\text{free}} + K_{vco}v_F(t), \\\\end{align} where \\\\omega_{vco}^{\\\\text{free}} is the VCO free- running (quiescent) frequency (i.e. for v_F(t)\\\\equiv 0), K_{vco} is the VCO gain (sensivity), and \\\\theta_{vco}(t) is the VCO phase. Finally, the continuous time nonlinear mathematical model of CP-PLL is as follows : \\\\begin{align} \\\\dot v_c(t) = \\\\tfrac{1}{C}i(t), \\\\quad \\\\dot\\\\theta_{vco}(t) = \\\\omega_{vco}^{\\\\text{free}} + K_{vco} ( Ri(t) \\\\+ v_c(t) ) \\\\end{align} with the following discontinuous piece-wise constant nonlinearity : i(t) = i\\\\big(i(t-), \\\\theta_{ref}(t), \\\\theta_{vco}(t)\\\\big) and the initial conditions \\\\big(v_c(0), \\\\theta_{vco}(0)\\\\big). This model is a nonlinear, non-autonomous, discontinuous, switching system. =Discrete time nonlinear model of the second-order CP-PLL= Time intervals of the PFD dynamics The reference signal frequency is assumed to be constant: \\\\theta_{ref}(t) = \\\\omega_{ref}t = \\\\frac{t}{T_{ref}}, where T_{ref}, \\\\omega_{ref} and \\\\theta_{ref}(t) are a period, frequency and a phase of the reference signal. Let t_0 = 0. Denote by t_0^{\\\\rm middle} the first instant of time such that the PFD output becomes zero (if i(0)=0, then t_0^{\\\\rm middle}=0) and by t_1 the first trailing edge of the VCO or Ref. Further the corresponding increasing sequences \\\\\\\\{t_k\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{t_k^{\\\\rm middle}\\\\\\\\} for k=0,1,2... are defined. Let t_k < t_k^{\\\\rm middle}. Then for t \\\\in [t_k,t_k^{\\\\rm middle}) the \\\\text{sign}(i(t)) is a non- zero constant (\\\\pm1). Denote by \\\\tau_k the PFD pulse width (length of the time interval, where the PFD output is a non-zero constant), multiplied by the sign of the PFD output: i.e. \\\\tau_k = (t_k^{\\\\rm middle} - t_k)\\\\text{sign}(i(t)) for t \\\\in [t_k,t_k^{\\\\rm middle}) and \\\\tau_k = 0 for t_k=t_k^{\\\\rm middle} . If the VCO trailing edge hits before the Ref trailing edge, then \\\\tau_k < 0 and in the opposite case we have \\\\tau_k > 0, i.e. \\\\tau_k shows how one signal lags behind another. Zero output of PFD i(t) \\\\equiv 0 on the interval (t_k^{\\\\rm middle},t_{k+1}): v_F(t) \\\\equiv v_k for t \\\\in [t_k^{\\\\rm middle},t_{k+1}) . The transformation of variables (\\\\tau_k,v_k) to p_k = \\\\frac{\\\\tau_k}{T_{\\\\rm ref}}, u_k=T_{\\\\rm ref} ( \\\\omega_{\\\\rm vco}^{\\\\text{free}} + K_{\\\\rm vco}v_k ) - 1, allows to reduce the number of parameters to two: \\\\alpha = K_{\\\\rm vco}I_pT_{\\\\rm ref}R, \\\\beta = \\\\frac{K_{\\\\rm vco}I_pT_{\\\\rm ref}^2}{2C}. Here p_k is a normalized phase shift and u_k+1 is a ratio of the VCO frequency \\\\omega_{\\\\rm vco}^{\\\\text{free}} + K_{\\\\rm vco}v_k to the reference frequency \\\\frac{1}{T_{\\\\rm ref}}. Finally, the discrete-time model of second order CP-PLL without the VCO overload : \\\\begin{align} & u_{k+1} = u_k +2\\\\beta p_{k+1}, & p_{k+1} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\frac{-(u_k + \\\\alpha + 1) + \\\\sqrt{(u_k + \\\\alpha + 1)^2 - 4\\\\beta c_k}}{2\\\\beta}, \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } p_k \\\\geq 0, \\\\quad c_k \\\\leq 0,  \\\\frac{1}{ u_k + 1} -1 + ( p_k \\\\text{ mod }1), \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } p_k \\\\geq 0, \\\\quad c_k > 0,  l_k-1, \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } p_k < 0, \\\\quad l_k \\\\leq 1,  \\\\frac{-(u_k + \\\\alpha + 1) + \\\\sqrt{(u_k + \\\\alpha + 1)^2 - 4\\\\beta d_k}}{2\\\\beta}, \\\\quad \\\\text{ for } p_k < 0, \\\\quad l_k > 1, \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} where : \\\\begin{align} c_k = (1 - ( p_k \\\\text{ mod }1))( u_k +1) - 1, S_{l_k} = -( u_k - \\\\alpha + 1 ) p_k + \\\\beta p_k^2, l_k = \\\\frac{1 - (S_{l_k} \\\\text{ mod }1)}{ u_k + 1}, d_k = (S_{l_k} \\\\text{ mod }1) + u_k. \\\\end{align} This discrete-time model has the only one steady state at (u_k=0,p_k=0) and allows to estimate the hold-in and pull-in ranges. If the VCO is overloaded, i.e. \\\\dot\\\\theta_{\\\\rm vco}(t) is zero, or what is the same: (p_k>0, u_k<2\\\\beta p_k-1) or (p_k<0, u_k<\\\\alpha-1), then the additional cases of the CP-PLL dynamics have to be taken into account. For any parameters the VCO overload may occur for sufficiently large frequency difference between the VCO and reference signals. In practice the VCO overload should be avoided. =Nonlinear models of high-order CP-PLL= Derivation of nonlinear mathematical models of high-order CP-PLL leads to transcendental equations which can not be solved analytically without using approximations.

Superior Court and Charles Lee, Real Party in Interest, 4 Cal.5th 903 (Cal. 2018) was a landmark case handed down by the California Supreme Court on April 30, 2018. A class of drivers for a same-day delivery company, Dynamex, claimed that they were misclassified as independent contractors and thus unlawfully deprived of employment protections under California‚Äôs wage orders.Dynamex Operations W. v. Superior Court, 4 Cal.5th 903, 914 (Cal. 2018). Their claims raised the question of what the appropriate standard was to determine whether workers should be classified as employees or as independent contractors under California‚Äôs wage orders.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 913‚Äì14. In a unanimous opinion, the California Supreme Court held that workers are presumptively employees for the purpose of California‚Äôs wage orders and that the burden is on the hiring entity to establish that a worker is an independent contractor not subject to wage order protections.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 916‚Äì17. The Court also held that in order to establish that a worker is an independent contractor, the hiring entity must prove each of the three parts of the ‚ÄúABC test.‚ÄùDynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 917. In applying this new test to Dynamex and its workers, the Court found that there was sufficient commonality of interest among the class of drivers with respect to parts B and C of the test to affirm the class certification issued by the California Court of Appeal. The decision inspired public debate and legislative action on this issue, which culminated when the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill 5 (\\"AB5\\") on September, 11 2019. The law codifies the Dynamex holding and extends its protections beyond the wage order context.Cal. Assemb. B. 5 ¬ß 1 (d).  Legal context  In employment law, there is a distinction between workers classified as employees as opposed to those classified as independent contractors. If a worker is classified as an employee, their employer must follow a variety of employment laws that protect the worker.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 912. These include laws governing minimum wages, overtime, meal and rest breaks as well as other working conditions of employers. Employers also need to pay taxes for social security, workers‚Äô compensation, and unemployment insurance as well payroll and employment taxes. In contrast, businesses that hire independent contractors to complete work, do not have to meet any of these legal obligations or incur related costs because independent contractors are not protected by employment statutes and regulations. This legal distinction creates economic incentives for businesses to misclassify workers as independent contractors.James F. Morgan, Clarifying The Employee/Independent Contractor Distinction: Does The California Supreme Court's Dynamex Decision Do the Job, 69 Lab. Law J. 4194899 (Sept. 18, 2018). Not only do they save on costs stemming from compliance with employment and tax laws, but they obtain an advantage over their competitors who do not misclassify their workers and thus incur these costs. Misclassification can impose costs not just on workers, but on society at large. As both the federal and California governments have recognized, misclassification deprives governments of substantial annual tax revenues and workers from numerous employment law benefits to which they are lawfully entitled. Recognizing the seriousness of this problem, California has imposed substantial civil penalties for misclassifying workers as independent contractors, particularly for ‚Äúwillful‚Äù misclassification.3 Witkin, Summary 11th Agency ¬ß 460 ‚Äì Willful Misclassification of Independent Contractor Status (2019). The California courts have long grappled with the appropriate standard for determining whether a worker is properly classified as an employee or an independent contractor for the purpose of California‚Äôs employment laws. At common law, the employment relationship was determined by the degree of control over the details of the work being performed.S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations, 48 Cal.3d 341, 350 (Cal. 1989). The California Supreme Court built on this common law foundation when it issued S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations, its seminal case on the subject.S.G. Borello & Sons, Inc. v. Department of Industrial Relations, 48 Cal.3d 341 (Cal. 1989) (en banc). In Borello, the California Supreme Court found that while control over the work performed was the ‚Äúmost significant‚Äù factor in determining whether there was an employment relationship under an employment statute, it could not be applied ‚Äúrigidly and in isolation.‚ÄùBorello, 48 Cal.3d at 350. The Court went on to identify other ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù factors that should be considered as well.Borello, 48 Cal.3d at 351. Among these were (1) whether the worker is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; (2) whether the type of work is usually done at the direction of a principal; (3) the level of skill required to perform the occupation in question; (4) whether the hiring entity or the worker provides the place of work, instrumentalities, or tools to do the work; (5) the length of time for which the services are performed; (6) whether the worker is paid by time or by job; (7) whether the work is part of the usual course of business for the hiring entity; and (8) whether or not the parties believe that their relationship is one of employer and employee.38 Cal. Jur. 3d Independent Contractors ¬ß 3. Applying these factors is a fact-specific inquiry, with courts looking to the totality of the circumstances, rather than any one particular factor. In 2010, in Martinez v. Combs, the California Supreme Court offered some additional interpretative gloss on the definition of ‚Äúemploy‚Äù in the context of California‚Äôs wage orders.Martinez v. Combs, 49 Cal.4th 35 (Cal. 2010). Wage orders are ‚Äúquasi-legislative regulations‚Äù enforced by the California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement.Cal. Civ. Prac. Employment Litigation ¬ß 4:20.See generally California Labor Code ¬ß¬ß 1173, 1178, 1178.5, 1182, 1185. The orders govern wages and hours as well as basic working conditions like meal and rest breaks on an industry-wide basis.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 913, n.3. In Martinez, the California Supreme Court considered an action brought by a worker, alleging that his employer had violated a wage order applicable to the industry in which he worked.Martinez, 49 Cal.4th at 42. In considering whether the worker was an employee and thus covered by the applicable wage order, the Court found that the wage order‚Äînot the common law‚Äîdefines the employment relationship in this context.Martinez, 49 Cal.4th at 62. So, the Court looked to the wage order‚Äôs text to find three alternative definitions of employment for the purpose of the workers‚Äô action: ‚Äú(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, or (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment relationship.‚ÄùMartinez, 49 Cal.4th at 64.  Factual background  The defendant in this case, Dynamex, was a corporation that offered same-day courier and delivery services nationwide, including in California. Its customers ranged from members of the public to large businesses like Home Depot. Dynamex solicited customers and set the rates for its delivery services. Dynamex enlisted drivers to complete the pickups and deliveries at the core of its business. Before 2004, Dynamex classified all of its California drivers as employees and compensated them in accordance with California‚Äôs wage and hour laws. But starting in 2004, the company chose to classify all of its drivers as independent contractors in order to achieve cost savings associated with avoiding the obligations that those laws impose. Under this policy, Dynamex hired drivers to provide delivery services for an indefinite period of time, but could terminate this arrangement at any point as long as Dynamex provided three days notice.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 918. Drivers could set their own schedule, but had to notify Dynamex in advance of the days they wished to work. On these days, a Dynamex dispatcher would assign available deliveries to drivers, although Dynamex did not guarantee drivers the number or type of deliveries in advance. Drivers could reject delivery requests, but were required to communicate quickly with the dispatcher if they wished to do so. Compensation depended on the type of delivery, but drivers were either paid a flat fee per delivery or a percentage of the delivery fee paid by the customer. Not included in drivers‚Äô compensation were various tools of the trade, which drivers used to complete their deliveries and were required to purchase themselves. Drivers were required to purchase delivery vehicles as well as any related transportation expenses such as gas, vehicle maintenance, or insurance on their vehicles. Drivers were also required to purchase a Nextel cell phone to communicate with dispatchers. In addition, they were required to purchase Dynamex shirts and badges and wear them while completing deliveries.  Procedural background  In January 2005, Charles Lee, the initial named plaintiff in this case, entered a written agreement with Dynamex to complete deliveries as an independent contractor. After completing 15 days of work for Dynamex, Lee stopped providing delivery services for Dynamex. Three months later, on April 15, 2005, he filed a class action suit against Dynamex in the Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of himself and all other similarly-situated Dynamex drivers.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 919.Complaint, Lee v. Dynamex, Inc., No. BC 332016, 2005 WL 6205073 (Cal. Superior Ct. Los Angeles Cnty, July 14, 2005) He alleged that Dynamex had misclassified its drivers as independent contractors, depriving them of overtime compensation, itemized wage statements, and compensation for business expenses as required by California‚Äôs wage orders. After the Superior Court initially denied class certification and the Court of Appeal reversed, the Superior Court certified a class of approximately 184 drivers who had performed pickup or delivery services for Dynamex between 2001 and the date of the certification order, were classified as independent contractors, and who had responded to questionnaires issued to current and former Dynamex drivers in a timely manner.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 920. The class excluded those among this group who employed other drivers or who performed delivery services for their own business or for another company.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 921. In certifying the class, the Superior Court found that the drivers met one of the central requirements of class action: commonality. To meet the requirement, the drivers needed to show that there were enough common issues of law or fact in the case that resolving them collectively would be more efficient for the judicial system and desirable to the parties than if the court reviewed the claims of each driver individually.Cal. Prac. Guide Civ. Pro. Before Trial Ch. 14-B. The Court found that all of the drivers‚Äô claims essentially relied on the same legal claim: Dynamex misclassified drivers as independent contractors. The Superior Court also found that the appropriate standard for determining whether workers are properly classified as independent contractors or employees for the purpose of wage orders was laid out in Martinez. That opinion defines ‚Äúto employ‚Äù in three alternative ways: ‚Äú(a) to exercise control over the wages, hours or working conditions, (b) to suffer or permit to work, or (c) to engage, thereby creating a common law employment relationship.‚Äù After analyzing each of these definitions in the context of the drivers‚Äô claims, the Superior Court found that common questions predominated the case because the first two definitions of employer can be demonstrated through common proof, even if the third common law test required individualized consideration.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 924. So, the Superior Court found that the commonality requirement was met and that a class action was a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù way to resolve the litigation. After attempting to renew their decertification motion, Dynamex asked the California Court of Appeal to overrule the Superior Court‚Äôs order denying Dynamex‚Äôs motion to decertify. With respect to the drivers‚Äô claims arising under the applicable wage order, the Court of Appeal denied Dynamex‚Äôs request, finding that the Superior Court had properly relied on the three alternative definitions of employment from Martinez in analyzing the drivers‚Äô class certification.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 924‚Äì25. Dynamex then petitioned for review of the Court of Appeal‚Äôs decision with the California Supreme Court.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 925. Dynamex argued that the Superior Court had erred because the definitions of employment offered by Martinez were only applicable to the determination of whether an entity is a joint employer of the workers in question.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 945. Instead, Dynamex argued, the multi-factor common law test from Borello controlled the determination of whether a hiring entity was an employer in the wage order context. The California Supreme Court granted review in order to consider the question of what the appropriate standard was for determining whether a workers is properly classified as an employee or an independent contractor for the purpose of obligations imposed by an applicable wage order.  Opinion of the court  Writing for a unanimous California Supreme Court, Chief Justice Cantil-Sakauye affirmed the Court of Appeal‚Äôs order regarding class certification. In so holding, the Court first found that the ‚Äúsuffer or permit to work‚Äù standard was the appropriate one for determining whether particular workers are employees within the definition of an applicable wage order.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 950. The Chief Justice wrote that this standard offers ‚Äúthe broadest definition‚Äù for the employment relationship and one far broader than the common law, ‚Äúright to control‚Äù definition.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 951, 953. She went on to explain that like a similar standard in the Fair Labor Standards Act, the ‚Äúsuffer or permit‚Äù definition was meant to extend coverage of statutory protections to the ‚Äúwidest class of workers that reasonably fall within reach of [the statute].‚ÄùDynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 951 (quoting then-Senator Hugo Black, an author of the Fair Labor Standards Act). She went on to explain that this ‚Äúexceptionally broad‚Äù standard was justified by the underlying purpose of wage orders: to provide a minimum level of sustenance for workers and their families.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 951‚Äì52. And as she further noted, an inclusive standard protects law-abiding businesses from unfair competition and the public at large from accruing societal costs associated with workers who are paid less than a living wage or forced to work in poor conditions.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 952‚Äì53. The Court then considered different tests for interpreting the ‚Äúsuffer or permit‚Äù standard. It turned first to tests with many factors like the Borello test or economic realities test used by courts in interpreting Fair Labor Standards Act claims.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 953‚Äì54. As the Court described, these tests attempt to consider all of the circumstances on a case-by-case basis in determining whether a worker is an employee or an independent contractor.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 954. But the Court opined that this approach has two serious disadvantages.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 954‚Äì55. First, they leave both hiring entities and their workers unsure of how workers should be classified, which often means that this determination is only made in courts after protracted litigation. Second, when a test has many factors, it becomes more malleable, allowing employers flexibility to structure their relationships with workers so as to avoid wage and hour liability.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 955. The Court then reached the principle holding of the case, interpreting the ‚Äúsuffer or permit‚Äù standard in the wage order context. The Court held that the hiring entity bears the burden of ‚Äúestablish[ing] that a worker is an independent contractor‚Äù and thus, ‚Äúnot intended to be included within the wage order‚Äôs coverage.‚ÄùDynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 956‚Äì57. The Court went on hold that in order for the entity to meet this burden, it must establish each of three factors, in what is called the ‚ÄúABC test‚Äù: > (A) that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hiring > entity in connection with the performance of the work, both under the > contract for the performance of the work and in fact; and (B) that the > worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity's > business; and (C) that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently > established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work > performed.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 957. Under this test, unless the hiring entity meets each of these three factors, the worker is considered an employee under the ‚Äúsuffer or permit to work standard‚Äù for the purpose of wage orders.30 No. 9 Bus. Torts Rep. 205, 209. Said another way, if the hiring entity fails to meet any one of these factors, then that is sufficient to show that the worker is an employee.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 964. The Court noted that it felt that this test would minimize the disadvantages of multi-factored tests and ‚Äúprovide greater clarity and consistency, and less opportunity for manipulation.‚Äù The Chief Justice went on to apply this standard to the relationship between Dynamex and its drivers. She held that under this interpretation of the ‚Äúsuffer or permit‚Äù standard, there were enough common interests by class members to justify the Superior Court‚Äôs certification of the proposed class of drivers.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 965. The Court found ‚Äútwo independently sufficient reasons for this holding. First, with respect to part B of the test, the Court found that there was sufficient commonality of interest as to whether the work performed by the drivers was outside the usual course of Dynamex‚Äôs business because deliveries were the core of Dynamex‚Äôs business.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 965‚Äì66. Second, with respect to part C of the test, the Court held that there was sufficient commonality of interest as to whether the drivers were engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business.Dynamex, 4 Cal.5th at 966. Here, the Court found that it persuasive that prior to 2004, drivers were classified as employees. So, questions under both parts B and C of the test were amenable on a class-wide basis.  Significance  The Dynamex decision inspired swift action by the California State Legislature. In December 3, 2018, Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez introduced Assembly Bill 5‚Äîor ‚ÄúAB5,‚Äù as it is commonly known.Cal. Assemb. B. 5 (as introduced by Assemb. Lorena Gonzalez, Dec. 3, 2018). AB5 expressed intent in its text to ‚Äúcodify‚Äù the Dynamex decision and ‚Äúclarify the decision‚Äôs application in state law.‚ÄùCal. Assemb. B. 5 ¬ß 1 (d) (as introduced by Assemb. Lorena Gonzalez, Dec. 3, 2018). As the Assemblywoman explained, ‚Äúthe courts had clearly had enough of these suits. From that day on, we said we‚Äôd really like to work on this.‚Äù The legislature also expressed its intent ‚Äúto ensure workers who are currently exploited by being misclassified as independent contractors instead of recognized as employees have the basic rights and protections they deserve under the law.‚Äù Later versions of the bill extend the AB5 test to apply to various Labor Code provisions and wage orders as well as the unemployment insurance code.See Cal. Assemb. B. 5 ¬ß 2(a) (as amended in Assembly, Mar. 26, 2019); Cal. Assemb. B. 5 ¬ß 2(a) (as amended in Assembly, May 1, 2019). A final version of the bill incorporating these amendments was passed on September 11, 2019 and signed into law on September 18, 2019. The new law went into effect on January 1, 2020.See Cal. Lab. Code ¬ß¬ß 2750.3, 3351; Cal. Unemp. Ins. Code ¬ß¬ß 606.5, 621. The Dynamex decision and AB5 were met with resistance in the business community including the California Chamber of Commerce. In particular, gig economy platforms like Uber, Lyft, and Doordash, whose business model depends on the classification of workers as independent contractors, opposed the decision and the legislation from its inception. A coalition of these companies and their allies pledged $110 million to secure a ballot initiative to overturn the legislation in 2020. Some workers have opposed the bill as well, concerned that employment classification will cause them to lose work.

Blassianus' home, based on the presence of a number of inscriptions, is believed to be Trieste. Based on his filiation, attested in at least one inscription, indicates his father's praenomen was Publius, and his tribe was Pupinia.  Life  The three earliest appointments Blassianus received, which comprise the steps of the tres militiae that equites followed in their military career, are recorded in several inscriptions from Trieste.These include and First was prefect of the Cohors II Asturum equitata, then stationed in Roman Britain; followed by military tribune in Legio VII, either Claudia or Gemina; and lastly prefect of the ala II Gallorum stationed in Cappadocia. Anthony Birley notes that \\"it would fit the chronology of his career if he obtained a commission from A. Platorius Nepos, governor of Britain 122-4, who was patron of Aquileia, a city close to Blassianus' home\\".Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 307 The remainder of his career in the imperial service is documented in a fragmentary inscription recovered from Ostia Antica honoring him as prefect by the collegium fabrum tignariorum. Blassianus received three civil appointments. The first was procurator of one of the gladiator training schools, the ludus matutinus. The second was procurator ad census accipiendos in Cappadocia. Third was procurator of the provinces of Gallia Lugdunensis and Aquitania. Blassianus then was commissioned as praefectus of the Classis Britannica, which Birley dates to c. 140.Birley, Fasti, p. 308 This was followed by two governorships: the first was as procurator of Mauretania Tingitana, which J.E.H. Spaul dates to 146-150;Spaul, \\"Governors of Tingitana\\", Antiquit√©s africaines, 30 (1994), p. 242 next was procurator of Raetia. After these came the signal appointment as praefectus of the Classis Ravennas, the second major fleet of the Roman military. Blassianus returned to Rome to hold the next two appointments. First was praefectus vigilum, commander of the vigiles or nightwatch of Rome; he may have preceded Gaius Tettius Maximus in this post. Next was an appointment as praefectus annonae; which may have fallen between the tenures of Lucius Volusius Maecianus and Titus Furius Victorinus. His last appointment was as governor of Egypt, one of the most prestigious offices an eques could hold; his tenure in Egypt is dated as extending from 167 to the following year.Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 297 The last known event in his life is his prefecture of the collegium honored the inscription mentioned above. This office has been dated to have fallen between the year 164 and 169. His life after this is not yet known.

In Columbus, Ohio, unrest began on May 28, 2020, two days after incidents began in Minneapolis. The events are a reaction to the killing of George Floyd shortly after Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 7 minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest the day before. Protests have been centered in Downtown Columbus, the Short North, and the South Side; within Downtown, most have been at Capitol Square, spreading to surrounding streets. The protests and riots have been met with a heavy police presence, although over 100 businesses have been vandalized, along with numerous government buildings. On May 30, Columbus issued an indefinite curfew, and Governor Mike DeWine ordered the Ohio National Guard to maintain order in the city. The curfew and the city's state of emergency are believed to be the first in 50 years. Protesters' tactics have primarily included picketing, marches, and die-ins, including shouting, speeches, and chants. A few more agitated events involved protesters throwing water bottles, rocks and bricks, and launching fireworks into lines of police. Officers, mounted police, and SWAT, and used pepper spray, tear gas, rubber and wooden pellets, and flashbangs to drive them back, and sometimes to attack those protesting non- violently. Columbus's police chief, along with Mayor Andrew Ginther, have stated there is evidence that some demonstrators protesting and rioting are from outside the community or state, including from the group Anonymous, turning the protests increasingly violent. Protests began to drop in violence around May 31, and the city has begun making changes to support racial equality. On June 1, the city declared racism a public health crisis, and Police Chief Thomas Quinlan and other officers marched with protesters for the first time. Mayor Ginther also created an independent review system for police aggression that has taken place during the protests. On June 2, Ginther joined Quinlan in the protests. The city-wide curfew was lifted on June 6. Background The George Floyd protests are an ongoing series of protests and civil disturbances that initially started in the Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul metropolitan area of Minnesota, United States, before spreading nationwide. In Columbus, Ohio, unrest began on May 28, 2020, two days after incidents began in Minneapolis. The events are a reaction to the killing of George Floyd shortly after Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest the day before. The events began amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the city of Columbus along with the rest of the United States and most of the world. The protests have involved large numbers of people in close proximity, creating fears the virus will spread and create new outbreaks. On June 3, Columbus Public Health identified a person who attended protests in downtown Columbus, despite feeling coronavirus symptoms on May 27, one day before protests had started downtown. TimelineMay=May 28 Ohio Theatre after May 28 damage Protests began at Broad & High Streets, the two main intersections of Columbus, and the location of the Ohio Statehouse. It began peacefully, though into the night the protests became violent. At around 7 p.m. EDT, some protesters blocked traffic on Interstate 71. Around 9 p.m. some protesters began to throw bottles. Protesters shouted, threw water bottles, eggs, shoes, and rocks, and launched fireworks into lines of police, while officers, mounted police, and SWAT used pepper spray, rubber and wooden pellets, flashbangs to drive them back. Some protesters threw the pepper spray back at police officers. Some tore trash cans and mailboxes from their mountings. Around 11:30, protesters used trash cans to smash the Statehouse's windows, and attempted to enter through its High Street doors (locked to the public for years). One person managed to enter the state auditor's ceremonial office through a window, though they left as soon as state troops arrived, and was arrested outside the building. Two lamps, over a century old, had their glass smashed, which may be difficult to replace. Small flags for forgotten soldiers on the east side of the building were set on fire; the remaining ones were brought inside by a Statehouse grounds crew. 28 Statehouse windows were shattered on May 28, along with the west doors, five pole lamps, some granite, and a bench. The Ohio Theatre, including its historic ticket office, had glass smashed in. The Columbus Association for the Performing Arts estimated the damage at $15,000. Numerous other buildings suffered damage. As protesters were dispersed, a group of about 400 went south down High Street to the Franklin County Courthouse, with some breaking windows as they passed by. The downtown DGX store, part of the Dollar General chain, was looted. Around midnight, more Columbus police and Ohio Highway patrol officers were called in to further disperse those who were vandalizing. May 29 May 29 protest at Livingston and Lockbourne Avenues In the afternoon, Governor DeWine encouraged people to protest, but urged them to peacefully. Protesters gathered at Livingston and Lockbourne Avenues in Columbus's South Side in the evening, in a peaceful protest with signs and chanted slogans. In the evening, community leaders met at the Lincoln Theatre along with Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin and Nick Bankston, president of the Columbus Urban League Young Professionals. The leaders acknowledged the damage, with some urging people to look beyond the damage, and others not condoning intentional property damage. Hundreds of people arrived downtown later in the evening. Columbus Police set up numerous choke points to control traffic and block protesters. Around 10 p.m., an emergency was declared, with police ordering protesters and reporters to leave the area. At around 11 p.m., officers began firing tear gas to disperse the crowd of over 100. Cars and pedestrians dispersed, some south, some north. Protesters sprayed a statue on the Ohio Judicial Center and tore out planted shrubs. Columbus City Council held a press conference in the evening, with support of protesting, though urging for nonviolence. Over 100 properties were damaged throughout the night. Five people were arrested that day for setting off fireworks and creating a panic, and five police officers were injured, at least two by rocks and bricks thrown at them. Harvard University basketball player Seth Towns, who had just recently graduated from the Ivy League school and will play for Ohio State University as a graduate student, was detained at the rally. May 30 In the morning of May 30, business owners began to clean up their vandalized businesses. One business reported that they hadn't had a problem with vandalism like this in their 40 years of operating. Bricks, rocks, pieces of granite, water bottles, and other debris lined the streets, while few storefronts were left untouched. Most windows were smashed, with graffiti on signs, walls, and windows across downtown. Milestone 229, at Bicentennial Park, had planned to reopen June 1, though the building was looted, stifling their reopening plans and causing significant damage. As well, it was announced in the morning that COTA, the city's local transit agency, would reroute all of its buses on May 30 around downtown, with no buses traveling through the affected areas. Thousands of protesters continued demonstrating beginning at 10 a.m. at the Ohio Statehouse, relatively peacefully yet still tense. Protesters were estimated at 2,000 people, more than previous days. Police aggression was reported, including pepper spraying, tear gas, and shoving people to the ground. Some politicians were with protesters early in the day, including Ohio U.S. Representative Joyce Beatty, Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin, and Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce. The three were hit with pepper spray by police around noon. At about 1:30 p.m., the city of Columbus issued an emergency declaration, advising people to avoid the area. By 3 p.m., Governor Mike DeWine called in the Ohio National Guard, with Ohio Highway Patrol officers to help with law enforcement. Police have been unable to respond to regular calls due to the protests. Mayor Andrew Ginther declared a curfew for 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. until things calm down, with any violators subject to arrest. The curfew excludes emergency services, news media, people traveling directly to or from work, and people seeking care, in dangerous circumstances, or experiencing homelessness. All downtown streets were indefinitely closed to non-emergency traffic at 6 p.m. The curfew and the city's state of emergency are believed to be the first in 50 years, since Mayor Sensenbrenner imposed a curfew in 1970 during violent protests at the Ohio State University campus. Protests into the night involved demonstrators throwing items including rocks, water bottles, a traffic cone, a bottle of urine, and a bag of rocks. Around 9:35 p.m., the city responded to a trash fire at a construction site downtown, near where protests were held. The curfew went into effect for the first time at 10 p.m. on May 30. 59 people were arrested following the May 30 protests. May 31 A nearly-completed apartment complex near Topiary Park caught on fire, with its roof collapsed. The fire is under investigation, and may be related to the protests happening. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost began sweeping up debris in Capitol Square early in the day, asking others to join him. Around noon, Hardin and Beatty, two of the politicians caught in police pepper spray on the previous day, made a statement supporting a civilian review commission to review police force, instead of allowing the department to investigate its own officers. They support immediate police reform, beyond commissions and studies into the issues. Hundreds gathered at the Ohio Statehouse in the morning into the afternoon for a fourth continuous day of protests. They were joined by members of the local Shiloh Christian Center, who gathered to pray for peace. Protests continued into the evening. Some protesters threw water bottles at police officers. =June=June 1 June 1 city-wide prayer gathering Protests took place in downtown Columbus as well as at the Ohio State University; the protests at the university were the first since George Floyd's death. The Ohio Judicial Center was closed on June 1 due to vandalism committed during the riots. The damage includes broken windows and graffiti messages such as \\"Fuck 12,\\" \\"BLM,\\" and \\"ACAB.\\" Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan and several other police officers joined protesters. Mayor Andrew Ginther and Columbus City Council denounced the police chief and his officers for their aggressive tactics. Ginther created an independent review board for police actions: he asks protesters to report instances of excessive force by police during the protests, to be reviewed by a civilian from the Department of Public Safety's Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance Office. On the same day, the city of Columbus declared racism a public health crisis, following Franklin County, which had done the same earlier that month. Over 1,200 people signed a letter of support of the city's declaration, many of whom are local business, institution, and nonprofit leaders. A group of protesters created a committee to call for the resignation of the mayor and chief of police; echoed by Stonewall Columbus's call for the police chief to resign on the same day. A protest near OSU lasted about 25 minutes past the city's curfew, until being broken up by police. The peaceful protest had about 200 participants. Police Chief Thomas Quinlan was marching with the crowd earlier in the day. 11 arrests were made for curfew violations in the evening of June 1. On the same night, student newspaper journalists from the Ohio State University were pepper-sprayed by police. The students, representing The Lantern newspaper, had shown their press credentials and were exempt from the city's curfew as journalists; officers replied with statements including that they \\"don't care\\" and to \\"get inside.\\" June 2 Die-in at the Ohio Statehouse, June 2 In the morning, Mayor Ginther and Police Chief Thomas Quinlan answered questions about the protests. Quinlan defended his officers' use of tear gas and pepper spray, stating that it helps disperse crowds without a need for arrests, charges, courtroom appearances, and further actions. Quinlan stated he just wants violent protesters to \\"leave and stop damaging our city\\". Protests continued peacefully at the Ohio Statehouse on the sixth consecutive day of protests, and were again held at the Ohio State University. There was no visible Columbus police presence at the Ohio Statehouse, given the change in tactics to prevent confrontations and violence. Mayor Ginther, Police Chief Thomas Quinlan, and other officers walked with protesters during evening protests. Protests were mostly peaceful. The majority of protesters left after the 10 p.m. curfew set in, while some continued to walk from Broad and High to Hudson Street. Some protesters continued on to the I-71 on-ramp before police arrived and blocked the ramp. The Columbus Urban League met with City Council President Shannon Hardin; the organization announced steps to address racial disparities, including seeking partnerships with the city's police union, and with other police, government, business, and nonprofit leaders. They also recommended implementing recommendations given in recent reports on the city's police reform, as well as advocating for Ohio to follow Columbus and Franklin County in declaring racism a public health crisis. Lastly, they recommended joining with city and county leaders to address health disparities between races in the area. June 3 A two-hour protest was staged at Mayor Andrew Ginther's home at The Knolls, a subdivision in northwest Columbus. More than 100 attended, and participated in a lie-in, lying down for the 8 minutes, 46 seconds that George Floyd was pinned down before he died. Police drove by, though there was no interaction with the crowd; the mayor was reportedly attending a prayer service elsewhere at the time. Protests downtown were smaller than previous days, at 300-400 by the afternoon, though more joined later into the evening. The group met at the William McKinley Monument, and marched two miles east down Long Street before returning. June 4 June 4 was noted as significantly calmer than previous days of protest. The protest sites in the morning and early afternoon were largely empty. About 100 people protested on High Street by the Statehouse, while others painted murals - the Huntington Center has a large plywood wall around it, and encouraged the Greater Columbus Arts Council to recruit paid artists to paint on it, in addition to protesters' statements and art. Into the evening, several hundred participated in protests around the Statehouse, a smaller number due to rain, though a peaceful and vocal crowd. A candlelight memorial was held in the late afternoon. At about 9 p.m., the crowd's intensity increased, with about 300 marching counter-clockwise around the Statehouse, though everyone was encouraged to disperse at 9:30 to keep with the city's curfew. June 5 March through the Short North, June 5 Mayor Ginther announced that an independent police civilian review board will be modeled in July, and staffed by January 2021. The city-appointed Community Safety Advisory Commission had recommended the civilian review panel in January 2020. Ginther also announced that the city is reevaluating the use of chemical sprays for crowd dispersal. Thousands of people attended a peaceful protest at the Ohio Statehouse, most wearing all black. Mayor Ginther mingled among them during the event. In the early afternoon, they marched to the Columbus police headquarters and back. The speeches and chants echoed similar and past protests, though with the addition of singing happy birthday to Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman shot and killed by Louisville police. Downtown streets were closed to traffic around 6:40 p.m. Around 7 p.m., thousands marched up High Street through the Short North, Old North Columbus, and past the Ohio State University campus to Lane Avenue in the University District. After curfew, at around 10:40, police began to show resistance, forming a line and wearing riot gear, though they did not use force to disperse the crowd, then dwindling to about 40 people. Also on June 5, about 500 medical workers (students, researchers, doctors, and nurses) participated in a demonstration at the Ohio State University's James Cancer Hospital. The event was a part of the nationwide \\"White Coats for Black Lives\\" movement, part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement. The protesters knelt for the 8 minutes, 46 seconds that George Floyd was pinned down for at his death. \\"White Coats\\" events were also held at other Central Ohio hospitals that day, including OhioHealth's Riverside Methodist Hospital, Grant Medical Center, Doctors Hospital, and Dublin Methodist Hospital. June 6 Protests continued with a march from downtown Bexley on Drexel Avenue down Broad Street to the Ohio Statehouse downtown. The group started with a few hundred people, though more joined in, and other groups marched from Goodale Park, Schiller Park, and the University District to converge on the Statehouse. Thousands of people attended the protests at the Statehouse. Mayor Ginther lifted the week-long curfew, based on peaceful protests, dialogues between protesters and police, no significant violent acts by either side, and no curfew arrests since June 3. A recent federal lawsuit was filed against the city over the curfew, because violence had decreased; the city and plaintiffs reached an agreement and the lawsuit will be dismissed. About 20 employees of local chain Northstar Cafe walked out on June 6. Service and bar staff walked out of its Short North location in protest of a company policy giving a 50% discount to police and firefighters. An early response to the Floyd protests on June 3 removed the longstanding policy, though it was reinstated on June 5. In addition to the walkout, the location's kitchen manager quit immediately over the policy, though he had given a two-weeks' notice prior. Evening protests involved several hundred gathering to rest and build relationships by the Franklin Park Conservatory. The group shared food, listened to music, and reflected and decompressed. Activists registered people to vote, spoke to advocate for change, and distributed lists of demands for change in city policing. June 7 Protests continued for an 11th day, with protesters marching at the Ohio Statehouse and City Hall. Protests at the Statehouse were calm, with relatively low attendance at about 300 protesters. The City Hall event was \\"Gathering of Black Excellence: A Prestigious Protest\\", a prayer and march attended by black men in suits and ties, signaling that they are serious, and need and deserve to be heard. Mayor Ginther and some Columbus police joined the march. On the same day, City Council members including its president called for charges for some protesters to be dismissed. The officials want charges for violating curfew and failing to disperse to be dismissed; the city attorney announced some curfew charges already have been. June 8 About 100 protesters marched west on Broad Street from downtown into Franklinton in support of the movement. In addition, an event was held at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas in Columbus, involving numerous public defenders kneeling for eight minutes and 46 seconds. June 9 June 9, the 13th day of protests, was the hottest day of the year so far. Crowds were smaller, though several online events were scheduled, along with additional protests into the coming weekend. Also that day, about 300 Ohio State University faculty signed a letter to the school's administration, asking it to cut ties with the Columbus police. June 10 The Ohio National Guard departed the city after nearly two weeks in Columbus. Columbus hosted its first recent hearing on police reform, after five months of inaction. The city council president apologized for inaction on the 330-page report on policing problems released August 2019, and officially delivered to the mayor in January. In the hearing, Mayor Ginther said creating the civilian oversight panel was his top priority, and stated he is calling on state law enforcement officials to assist investigations into Columbus police malfeasance. Some of the city's commissioners pushed for reprioritizing the department's budget, for fewer armored vehicles and helicopters and more social services for police to handle routine societal problems. Focus was also on new crowd control training to allow for civilians' First Amendment rights, and to avoid violent tactics during nonviolent situations. Another result of the protests included Franklin County Public Health hiring a new associate director of equity and inclusion, focusing on racism and health disparities in Franklin County. June 12 A march was organized from Columbus City Hall to the Ohio Statehouse. The group was made up of mothers of men and women killed by Ohio law enforcement, with the names of the deceased written on their shirts. More than 1,000 protesters joined them. June 14 A protest was held at Northstar Cafe in the Short North, following employee walkouts over the company reinstating a 50% police discount. June 16 Protesters parked cars across High Street in front of the Ohio Statehouse and blocked traffic. June 19 Protests continued. Amid Pride Month, the group Black, Out and Proud held an event in recognition of the interlinked fight for civil rights of black and LGBT communities. June 20 Protests, which were mostly peaceful, continued outside the Statehouse. The groups Columbus Freedom Coalition and Black Queer Intersectional Collective held a protest at Mayor Ginther's house, aimed toward \\"abolishing, defunding, dismantling, demilitarizing the Columbus Division of Police\\". June 21 Afternoon conflict at Broad and High, June 21 A peaceful march, titled the LGBTQ Unity March, was held by local black, queer-owned company Kingfinity in the early afternoon, marching from the Ohio Statehouse to Stonewall Columbus. Later in the evening, Statehouse- area protests involving about 250 participants reached a higher conflict than in recent days, beginning with protesters blocking traffic. It led to two arrests, pepper spray being used on protesters, and additional police being called into the area. One of the arrests was over an electric scooter thrown at a police officer. The June 21 conflict was controversial, as the mayor had banned the use of chemical agents against nonviolent protesters less than a week prior. Mayor Ginther defended the actions, saying that the police were met with violence. Several Columbus City Council members disagreed, and condemned the use of the chemical agents. Another controversy arose over a man with two prosthetic legs, both allegedly removed by police during the conflict. Footage from police body cameras contradict the claim, while other videos show the man throwing a sign at police. June 22 Columbus police officers, speaking anonymously, detailed low morale and unsteady leadership in the department and mixed signals from the city government. Regarding the incident on the prior day, they recounted several \\"stand-down\\" orders, conflicting with official accounts by the mayor and Division of Police. June 27 Hundreds gather at a \\"recall Mayor Ginther\\" rally, with many calling on Ginther to defund the city's police department. September 23 About 300 gathered at the Ohio Statehouse to picket and march in protest of the minimal charges brought against officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor.https://www.dispatch.com/story/news/local/2020/09/23/columbus-protest- breonna-taylor-indictment-acquittals-downtown/3511378001/ Protesters Support stand at the William McKinley Monument by the Statehouse Messages and aims of the protesters are diverse. Many aim to seek justice for the deaths of people of color recently killed across the country, including several in Columbus. Protesters have demanded police reform, including more restraint during peaceful protests, lowering the police budget (defund the police), instituting reforms suggested months prior, and having more transparency and accountability in the department. The police budget was reported at 37 percent of the city's $1 billion budget, which advocates state can be reinvested into communities, improving lives, and crime prevention. The protesters in downtown Columbus and other central parts of the city are diverse, as people of all races are encouraged to attend. The makeup was reportedly significantly more diverse than 2016 protests' crowds, which were predominantly attended by black residents. By June 13, most of the protesters downtown have been predominantly white, and in majority-white suburbs, some white people have led events. The multiracial makeup of the crowds is largely supported and encouraged by Columbus protest groups. The makeup of the protesters, especially those involved in vandalizing and attacking police, has been in question since the protests began. Columbus's police chief, along with Mayor Andrew Ginther, have stated there is evidence that some demonstrators protesting and rioting are from outside the community or state, including from the group Anonymous, turning the protests increasingly violent. A June 3 investigation of the 99 people arrested since protests began revealed that all 99 live in Ohio. Only nine of those arrested have addresses outside Franklin or its contiguous counties. The mayor stated that the arrests are inconclusive alone, referring to a bus filled with bats, rocks, meat cleavers, and axes, found by Columbus police on May 31. The bus, registered in Vermont, was parked by Key Bank in Capitol Square before being searched by police. Business actions and mural artwork Support signage at a Columbus business Short North businesses, largely boarded-up due to damage and/or to prevent damage, have variously used the plywood boards as posters of support, with messages including \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and \\"I can't breathe\\". The Huntington Center on Capitol Square has a large plywood wall around it, and has encouraged the Greater Columbus Arts Council to recruit paid artists to paint on it, in addition to protesters' statements and art. The works are planned to be preserved and exhibited by the Greater Columbus Arts Council. About 1,200 local businesses, nonprofits, and institutions signed a letter to Columbus City Council supporting its declaration of racism as a public health crisis. The Garden, an adult store in the Short North, has been acting as a makeshift first aid and distribution center for protesters. The Central Ohio African-American Chamber of Commerce is raising money for black-owned businesses damaged during the protests. At least a half dozen of these businesses were damaged between downtown and the Short North. Several businesses in the city have been in controversy as they supported police actions. Condado, an Ohio-based chain restaurant, fulfilled an order to be sent to police. Among its staff refusing to fulfill it, the workers were threatened with termination, and therefore walked out in protest. At Northstar Cafe, a longstanding 50 percent police discount was rescinded during the protests, though the discount was reinstated soon afterward, prompting employees to walk out. Police actions Police had been using tear gas and pepper spray to disperse protesters, hoping they would leave to recover and not return. Protesters and journalists have complained that these methods are being used on nonviolent protesters. Other methods used, especially during the initial violent protests, include the use of mounted police, SWAT, and the National Guard using rubber and wooden pellets and flashbangs to drive protesters back. One action taken by police had been to empty water bottles, preventing them from being thrown at officers, and preventing protesters from washing away tear gas to immediately return to protests. The Central Ohio Street Medic Collective Facebook group spread rumors, repeated on Twitter posts, that some water being passed around is purposefully contaminated with antifreeze to be toxic, though Central Ohio hospitals have had no recorded instances of patients taken ill by the substance. =Police aggression= Columbus police pepper-spraying a medic, May 30 On May 30, police aggression was reported, including pepper spraying, tear gas, and shoving people to the ground. On May 31, seven cases of excessive police force during the protests were reported by the local news site Columbus Navigator. They include instances of police using pepper spray on protesters walking away or leaving protests, and removing a protester's mask in order to spray them. On June 1, Mayor Andrew Ginther and Columbus City Council denounced the police chief and his officers for their aggressive tactics. On June 5, the family of a Columbus protester, a recent Ohio State University graduate, posted on Instagram that she had died on May 30 as the result of an asthma attack brought on by tear gas at a protest downtown two days prior. A coroner's report later determined the death to be due to an unrelated genetic condition. Government and institutional effects On May 31, Ohio U.S. Representative Joyce Beatty and Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin, two of the politicians caught in police pepper spray on the previous day, made a statement supporting a civilian review commission to review police force, instead of allowing the department to investigate its own officers. They support immediate police reform, beyond commissions and studies into the issues. Mayor Ginther set up an email account for citizens to report misconduct by Columbus police. In its first week, the account received about 700 emails. Of these about 400 were complaints of excessive force, and 230 were in support of police. 27 were from family members of police, concerned about officers' safety. Other complaints were filed with the police department's internal affairs bureau. On June 1, Mayor Andrew Ginther and Columbus City Council denounced the police chief and his officers for their aggressive tactics. Ginther created an independent review board for police actions: he asks protesters to report instances of excessive force by police during the protests, to be reviewed by a civilian from the Department of Public Safety's Equal Employment Opportunity Compliance Office. On the same day, the city of Columbus declared racism a public health crisis, following Franklin County, which had done the same earlier that month. Over 1,200 people signed a letter of support of the city's declaration, many of whom are local business, institution, and nonprofit leaders. On June 5, Mayor Ginther announced that an independent police civilian review board will be modeled in July, and staffed by January 2021. The city-appointed Community Safety Advisory Commission had recommended the civilian review panel in January 2020. On June 7, City Council members including its president called for charges for some protesters to be dismissed. The officials want charges for violating curfew and failing to disperse to be dismissed; the city attorney announced some curfew charges already have been. On June 10, Columbus hosted its first recent hearing on police reform, after five months of inaction. The city council president apologized for inaction on the 330-page report on policing problems released August 2019, and officially delivered to the mayor in January. In the hearing, Mayor Ginther said creating the civilian oversight panel was his top priority, and stated he is calling on state law enforcement officials to assist investigations into Columbus police malfeasance. Some of the city's commissioners pushed for reprioritizing the department's budget, for fewer armored vehicles and helicopters and more social services for police to handle routine societal problems. Focus was also on new crowd control training to allow for civilians' First Amendment rights, and to avoid violent tactics during nonviolent situations. Also on June 10, Ohio State announced it will establish a task force to review racial dispatities at the school, and the offices of research and diversity/inclusion will establish a $1 million fund to study racism and racial disparities. Another result of the protests included Franklin County Public Health hiring a new associate director of equity and inclusion, focusing on racism and health disparities in Franklin County. On June 11, Mayor Ginther announced he will give an executive order to require all fatal use of force cases and cases of death in police custody in the city to be investigated by the Ohio Attorney General's criminal investigation bureau. The Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the state's official crime lab. The independent investigations are aimed to restore confidence in Columbus police, and ensures that these deaths will be investigated by professionally-trained officials. The order will act as a law, but will be supplemented with an addition to the city code. On June 16, after reevaluating the use of chemical sprays for crowd dispersal, the mayor announced that the sprays will be banned, limited only to \\"clear instances of violence\\". A new community panel was formed to give input to the police department on community policing, practices, and strategies. The panel is diverse, including eleven people of color and nine women. On June 17, the city announced it will join the \\"8 Can't Wait\\" movement, which aims to ban chokeholds, exhaust all means before shooting at suspects, require a warning before shooting, requiring de-escalation, banning firing at moving vehicles, requiring a use-of-force continuum, comprehensive reporting on use of force and other incidents, and requiring police officers to intervene when their colleagues engage in wrongdoing. The city already has a use-of-force continuum, bans chokeholds, and bans firing on moving vehicles unless in a case of life-or-death, protecting an officer or bystander. Police are also already supposed to report misconduct they see from other officers. The City of Columbus announced it will look into revising its symbols, including its city seal and flag, due to their associations with Christopher Columbus. The news comes amid announcements of two of the city's three statues of the explorer being removed. On June 19, Franklin County (containing most of the city of Columbus) announced it is replacing Columbus Day as a paid holiday for its government employees with Juneteenth, celebrating the abolition of slavery in the U.S. The change will go into effect June 2021. Damage and statue removals Local art in support of the protests on the boarded-up Ohio Theatre, June 5 Statue of Christopher Columbus at Columbus State Community College, wrapped to prevent or conceal vandalism. The statue has since been removed. Numerous properties were damaged during the protests, mostly on the first three nights. Damage has predominately been downtown and in the Short North. Notable buildings damaged include the Columbus Dispatch Building, the Ohio Theatre, the PNC Building, the Borden Building, the Lazarus Building, the Ohio Statehouse, Trinity Episcopal Church, First Congregational Church, the Columbus Athenaeum, and the Ohio Judicial Center. Businesses affected included restaurants, print shops, banks, a funeral home, a computer repair store, and a pet store. The Columbus Dispatch reported that many owners probably have riot damage covered in their insurance policies, covering material damage and loss of furniture or computers, and covering business interrupted during the protests. J. Averi Frost, executive director of the Central Ohio African- American Chamber of Commerce, noted her skepticism, that insurance companies avoid paying, and might not give business-interruption coverage due to the pandemic already shuttering businesses. Statues graffitied include the William McKinley Monument by the Ohio Statehouse and the Statue of Arnold Schwarzenegger by the Greater Columbus Convention Center. At the time, the city also contained three statues of its namesake, Christopher Columbus, known for \\"discovering America\\", afterward colonizing and enslaving its indigenous peoples. The Floyd protests drew renewed attention to the statues. Petitions exist to remove them and to rename the city of Columbus. Columbus State removed its statue of Columbus, which was the first removed; representatives of the other two institutions then stated they had no plans to remove their statues. Statues of the explorer have been damaged or toppled in Saint Paul, Richmond, and Boston during the Floyd protests. Statues of Christopher Columbus in the city included: * Statue of Christopher Columbus (1955), Columbus City Hall (removed July 1) * Statue of Christopher Columbus (1959), Columbus State Community College (removed June 19) * Statue of Christopher Columbus (1892), Ohio Statehouse (removal was rejected July 16) On June 19, Franklin County (containing most of the city of Columbus) announced it is replacing Columbus Day as a paid holiday for its government employees with Juneteenth, celebrating the abolition of slavery in the U.S. The change will go into effect June 2021. Transportation effects and controversies During the city-issued nighttime curfew, all downtown streets were closed to non- emergency traffic, affecting private automobiles and public transit. As well, several protests and marches involved temporary street closures. The city's local public transit agency, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA), stopped all service through downtown from May 30 to June 9. Service was rerouted given a Columbus Division of Police emergency established on every downtown street, banning COTA from using the downtown streets for public transit, despite most protests only taking place on High Street and Capitol Square. The service changes affect 14 active bus routes (discounting routes stopped due to COVID-19 ridership decreases). The city's curfew also caused service to end system-wide at 9 p.m. COTA initially reported its service changes were to ensure customers' safety and \\"give protesters a safe space to demonstrate for the end to systemic racism\\", though after criticism because the protests are over a much smaller area, the agency instead reported that it was due to the police emergency declared. On June 7, COTA announced it was granted closer access to the center of downtown, allowing stops and transfers on Broad Street and Grant Avenue. COTA was also criticized after a video of the agency's buses transporting police circulated online. The agency responded by saying that it is part of a longstanding agreement to transport emergency workers, including police, and that the buses are not being used to transport arrested protesters. At least one electric scooter was thrown at police, on May 28, potentially leading to the scooters being removed from downtown streets beginning on the following day.

Early life and family Goburdhun was born in a middle class Indo-Mauritian family in the Rivi√®re du Rempart District of the Mauritius, an island archipelago in the Indian Ocean where French is widely spoken. At the time of his birth, the Mauritius were a British colony. Goburdhun's grandfather had arrived in the Mauritius as an indentured laborer from India and rose up to become a schoolmaster. Goburdhun was educated in Port Louis at the Royal College Port Louis and the Institut fran√ßais du Royaume-Uni. As a child, he was considered be \\"naughty and rebellious, through intelligent\\", and was known as \\"Tipu the Rebel\\". His father was a stern, authoritarian man who often beat his son with a rod for his rebellious streak. An outstanding student, in spite of being frequently caned by his teachers, Goburdhun also excelled as an athlete. As the Mauritius had no universities under British colonial rule, Goburdhun left to attend university in Britain, but while on his way, passed through France, and decided to attend university there instead. Goburdhun had a lifelong love affair with Paris, which was always his favorite city. His brother Hurrylall Goburdhun became a Judge of the Supreme Court of Mauritius. Lawyer and diplomat Goburdhun was educated in France and remained a lifelong Francophile. While attending the University of Lille in France in the 1930s, Goburdhun befriended an young Vietnamese Catholic student named Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, who remained a lifelong friend. Afterwards, he obtained a law degree at the Middle Temple in London. Goburdhun worked as a lawyer in Port Louis. From 1939 to 1944, he served as a judicial officer of the Supreme Court of the Mauritius. In 1943, Goburdhun was made a Civil member of the Order of the British Empire for his work as a civil servant in the Mauritius. In 1945-1946, he served as a judge at a labour court in Port Louis. In the 1948 elections for the Legislative Council of Mauritius, he ran for office, winning 405 votes in the Pamplemousses District. Following the failure of his political career, Goburdhun moved to India, which became independent in 1947 to pursue a career in diplomacy. In 1949, he married Kamala Sinha, by whom he had one daughter, Anuradha Goburdhun Bakhshi. Goburdhun served as the charge d'affairs at the Indian embassy in Prague, Czechoslovakia from 1948 to 1952. As India had stationed no ambassador in Prague, Goburdhun was in charge of the embassy. Once he organised a diplomatic reception to be attended by all of the other ambassadors in Prague, causing his wife to be extremely upset when she was learned the British ambassador would be attending, requiring him to explain that India was now independent and he was the equal of the British ambassador. In 1951 his name briefly hit the headlines when the Czechoslovak police arrested and charged with espionage an American journalist, William N. Oatis. At Oatis's trial in Prague, Oatis confessed to espionage and named Goburdhun as one of the diplomats he was alleged to have spied for. After Oatis was released in 1953, he retracted his confession as being induced by torture, and stated he merely sometimes cross- checked information with Goburdhun, engaging in standard journalistic practice, before writing a story. In January‚ÄìFebruary 1953, he served as the deputy secretary at the Indian foreign ministry. Goburdhun subsequently served as the counselor at the Indian embassy in Beijing in 1953-55. Before a dispute over where the precise Sino-Indian border was high up in the Himalayas spoiled Indo-Chinese relations, the relationship between the two nations were warm and friendly, and Goburdhun enjoyed being stationed in Beijing, where he was treated with respect as a diplomat from a friendly nation. It was as Goburdhun's service in China was winding down that relations between New Delhi and Beijing began to sour as India maintained its claim to the McMahon Line that had been laid down by the British in 1914 as the Sino-Indian frontier, a claim that China rejected. From 1955 to 1957, he worked as a counselor at the Indian embassy in Paris, France. Of all his diplomatic postings, Goburdhun enjoyed the one in Paris the most, being described by his daughter as being \\"overjoyed\\" to be living in his beloved Paris. In March‚ÄìDecember 1958, Goburdhun worked as the head of public relations department at the Foreign Ministry in New Delhi. In December 1958, Goburdhun arrived at the Dar al- Makhzen in Rabat, Morocco to present his credentials as India's ambassador to King Mohammed V. During his time in Morocco, Goburdhun came close to adopting the daughter of an Italian diplomat after her parents were drowned at sea. The \\"Maneli Affair\\" He became chairman of the International Control Commission in October 1962 assigned to supervise the Geneva accords of 1954. Goburdhun was well suited for this role as a honest broker, establishing cordial relations with the leaders of both North Vietnam and South Vietnam. As Goburdhun was fluent in French, a language widely spoken by elites in both Vietnams, he had no difficulty in communicating with Vietnamese elites. The American historian Ellen Hammer called Goburdhun a \\"exuberant and assertive\\" man with a strong interest in finding a way to end the Vietnam war. Just after Goburdhun's arrival in Vietnam, the Sino-Indian war of October‚ÄìNovember 1962 saw China defeat and humiliate India in a sharp, short campaign in the Himalayas. The spectacle seeing the Indian Army being utterly crushed by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and retreating in chaos back into India caused Indian diplomacy to taken a pronounced anti-Chinese turn as the Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru never forgave Mao Zedong for that humiliation. The British ambassador in Saigon, Henry Hohler, reported the Sino-Indian war was having \\"repercussions\\" on the Indian delegation to the ICC. Hohler reported to London after talking to Goburdhun that he had previously maintained that the ICC needed \\"positive objectivity\\", but after India's defeat, \\"he now considers it his duty to use his influence discreetly on the side of the free world-encouraging any activity which favors Western interests\\". However, the conclusion Goburdhun reached was that the war was pushing North Vietnam closer to China, and that ending the war would allow the traditional Sino-Vietnamese antagonism to reassert itself as Goburdhun knew from his contacts within Hanoi that North Vietnamese leaders were willing to accept Chinese help only because the United States was supporting South Vietnam. After the Sino-Indian war, the principle aim of Indian diplomacy was to reduce and weaken China's influence in Asia. Unlike the Americans who knew little about Vietnamese history, the Indians were more familiar with the histories of near-by Asian states, and appreciated the full depth of the profound mistrust the Vietnamese had of China, a state had conquered Vietnam in 111 BC and ruled it as a Chinese province for the next thousand years. The Americans had hoped that after the Sino-Indian war that India would become an American ally in Asia as the two nations had common anti-Chinese foreign policies, but the conclusion reached by Nehru was that India should promote neutralism in Southeast Asia as the best way of reducing Chinese influence in Southeast Asia. This was especially the case because after the Sino-Indian war on the principle that \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\", Nehru took an advantage of the Sino-Soviet split to form a de facto alliance with the Soviet Union against China. Because the Americans had a military alliance with India's archenemy Pakistan, from the Indian perspective this ruled out the possibility of an alliance with the United States and caused the Indians to reach out to the Soviet Union instead. Since the Soviet Union was also supporting North Vietnam, the Indians resisted the pressure from the Americans to have their ICC delegates condemn North Vietnam. Instead of taking the expected pro-American positions, Hohler reported in late 1962 that Goburdhun was engaged in \\"masterly inactivity\\" while \\"marking time for an infinite period\\". His daughter described Vietnam as the most difficult of his diplomatic assignments, recalling that he \\"spent long hours in his office and often returned in a bad mood or imprisoned in a pregnant silence. As soon as he got back, he would lock himself in his study or pace furiously along the long veranda that circled the house\\". Goburdhun lived in a house in Saigon built by a wealthy Chinese merchant, and notably refused to allow his children to leave the grounds of the house, saying that Saigon was too dangerous. Working closely with the French ambassador to South Vietnam, Roger Lalouette, and the Polish Commissioner to the ICC, Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli, Goburdhun met in the spring of 1963 with both Chairman Ho Chi Minh of North Vietnam and President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam to discuss a possible federation of the two Vietnams as a way to end the war. In March 1963, Maneli reported to Warsaw: \\"It would be desirable for the North and the guerrillas to give Diem some respite. Then, as Diem promised Goburdhun, he would get rid of the Americans by himself and would join the India line. It would be necessary to facilitate direct North-South contacts. This could take place in [New] Delhi, where the two sides have their representatives.\\" In 1963, North Vietnam had suffered its worse drought in a generation, and the possibility of having rice exported from the fertile Mekong river valley, South Vietnam's \\"rice bowl\\", would had solved a number of problems in North Vietnam. At the same time, the Sino-Soviet split with both Nikita Khrushchev and Mao Zeodong pressuring Ho to side with them left Ho in a precious position. At the same time, the Buddhist crisis had caused a rift in the once warm relations between President John F. Kennedy of the United States and Diem, with Kennedy pressuring Diem to disallow his younger brother and right-hand man, Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu. On 24 April 1963, Maneli reported to Warsaw after meeting Goburdhun: \\"Today Ambassador [Ramchundur] Goburdhun left for India. He again reminded [me] that he would visit Ambassador Przemys≈Çaw Ogrodzi≈Ñski...They [the Indians] consider Diem, his brother [Ngo Dinh Nhu], and sister-in-law, Madame Nhu, to be the main elements [which] strive to make the Americans withdraw. c) They are against the American-English conception of removing them from power by means of a possible coup, because they do not want an official government run by a military junta. d) [Jawaharlal] Nehru supposedly agreed to a wide political amnesty due to the Indian advice. The policy of so-called ‚Äúopen arms‚Äù has already been proclaimed towards the insurgents who resigned from the fight\\" In a meeting in Hanoi, Ho told Goburdhun that Diem was \\"in his own way a patriot\\", noting that Diem had opposed French rule over Vietnam, and ended the meeting saying that the next time he met Diem \\"shake hands with him for me\\". In May 1963, Ho publicly posted a ceasefire with the only condition being the withdrawal of all the American advisers from South Vietnam. In a meeting in Hanoi, the North Vietnamese Premier Ph·∫°m VƒÉn ƒê·ªìng told Maneli that his government was prepared to accept a federation and would drop its demand for the National Liberation Front, the 'Viet Cong', to enter the government in Saigon as part of the price for peace. Reflecting the problems imposed by the drought in North Vietnam, ƒê·ªìng told Maneli that he was willing to accept a ceasefire which would be followed up by a barter trade with coal from North Vietnam being exchanged for rice from South Vietnam. Maneli later wrote that he had the impression that the North Vietnamese were still angry with the outcome of the Geneva conference in 1954, believing that the Soviet Union and China had imposed an unfavorable settlement on them for the sake of better relations with the West. He felt that ƒê·ªìng did not want the Soviets, the Chinese or the Americans involved in any new talks. In Saigon, Goburdhun renewed his friendship with Nhu, and uniquely was able to maintain a friendship with Nhu's abrasive wife, Madame Nhu. Accordingly to one of Nhu's bodyguards, he saw at a dinner hosted by Goburdhun, Nhu talking to an unknown man with an \\"intellectual\\" demeanor and whose chest pocket had on it a yellow star on a red background, the symbol of North Vietnam. The fact that this account first appeared in a book published in 1971 in Saigon, How Does One Kill a President?, co-written by Dr. Tr·∫ßn Kim Tuy·∫øn, the spymaster under the Ngo brothers who had fallen out with them in 1963, has led many historians to dismiss this account. However, regardless if Goburdhun did set up a meeting between Nhu and a North Vietnamese official, on 25 August 1963 he did arrange for Nhu to meet Maneli at a reception at the Gia Long Palace. Goburdhun together with Lalouette formed a semi-circle who edged Maneli towards Nhu, who agreed to meet Maneli on 2 September. Through Goburdhun, Lalouette and Maneli all believed there was a chance for peace, the coup of 1‚Äì2 November 1963 that saw the Ngo brothers killed put an end to their plans. Later life After leaving the ICC, Goburdhun served as the Indian ambassador to Algeria from 1964 to 1966. From 1967 to 1969, he served as the Indian ambassador to Turkey. From 1970 to his retirement in 1985, he worked as a legal adviser to the Supreme Court of India in New Delhi. An Indian nationalist, Goburdhun's favorite advice to his children was \\"Don't lose faith in India!\\", contending that the problems of poverty in India would be one day solved.

Allen that analyzes the experience of Black residents of the United States as that of a colonized nation within a nation. Allen primarily analyzes Black organizing in the 1960s and often draws from the work of Frantz Fanon.  Summary  Allen focuses on Black activism in the United States following the Civil Rights Movement and details how corporate interests and White-led power structures co-opted and de-radicalized Black Power and Black nationalism. Allen cites the Ford Foundation funding of the Congress of Racial Equality as an example of how Black-led movements are influenced to align with the interest of more mainstream organizations. Allen further explores this idea through the response to the 1967 Newark riots and critiques Black leaders who focused on electoral representation instead of systemic change for communities. As part of his analysis of potential avenues for change he also stridently critiques Black capitalism as a method for social change.  Legacy  Black Awakening has been described as \\"seminal\\" and \\"groundbreaking\\" in the field of Internal Colonialism Theory, and as \\"the most incisive application of Internal Colonialism Theory to African America.\\" It has also been described as \\"important\\" for its examination of Black capitalism. Despite being well-received at its original publication, Allen's work grew neglected as Internal Colonialism Theory lost prominence after the 1970s.

Viscount Stair is an institutional writer and authoritative source of law in Scots law. Possession is traditionally viewed as state of fact, rather than real right (or right in rem/ property right) and is not the same concept as ownership in Scots law. It is now said that certain possessors may additionally have a separate real right of the ius possisendi (the right to possess).Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 127. Like much of Scots property law, the principles of the law of possession mainly derive from Roman law. In possession, the custodian of the property (both heritable and moveable property are capable of possession) is termed a possessor and described as being in possession of the property if he/she detains the property with the necessary mental intention.Stair I, 1, 17. Viscount Stair is an institutional writer and authoritative source of law in Scots law. Even if regarded as a real right, possession is distinct from the real right of ownership, and without the real right of ownership, or other possessory real right, a possessor's legal rights to the property are limited. However, the possessor has one important legal right, the right not to be unlawfully dispossessed, and its remedy, the action of spuilze (pronounced 'spooley'), is still enforceable in modern times. The remedies within an action of spuilzie include restitution (return) of the property and compensation. Possession is relevant to many areas of Scots law.  Possession and Ownership  Possession is distinct from the concept of ownership, deriving from the same distinction found in Roman law. However, possession is commonly regarded as the foundation of ownership due its requirement in the creation of the real right of ownership (such as by occupatio and within transfers of corporeal moveable property). Nicholas illustrated the difference between possession and ownership in Roman law as: > \\"There is an obvious distinction in ordinary language between having a thing > and being entitled to have it. The thief is not entitled to what he has > stolen but he nevertheless has it, and conversely the man who has pawned the > ring is still entitled to it but no longer has it. The difference between > being entitled to a thing and actually having it is at the root of this > distinction in Roman law.\\" The Roman jurist Ulpian also wrote that \\"possession and ownership have nothing in common\\".Nicholas, Barry. (1962). An introduction to Roman law. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. 107\\\\. . OCLC 877760. Therefore the term in possession in Scots law does not relate to the real right of ownership but of the factual situation in which a possessor occupies, or holds, property. = Reform = Whilst possession is a distinct concept from ownership, certain reforms have been introduced into Scots law providing protections of possessors who do not also have a valid right of ownership in the property they possess. For land, this includes the good faith protections available to deed grantees under the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.86 The Scottish Law Commission in its Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable Property (SLC Report No 228, 2012) have recommended the introduction of protections for possessors to allow them ownership of corporeal moveable property in certain circumstances: > \\"The Commission recommends two new rules which would convert possession to > ownership. The first would apply where the person possessing the object > reasonably believes that he or she is the owner, but turns out not to be ‚Äì > usually because the person from whom the object was bought was not the true > owner. Provided that the possessor is in good faith (and does not, for > instance, have reason to believe that the object was stolen), he or she > would become owner after possessing the object for a continuous period of 20 > years. The second rule applies to lent or deposited property where the owner > can no longer be traced. Although the rule is general in application, it is > particularly aimed to help museums and galleries. Under the new rule, the > holder of the object would be able to claim ownership if the owner had not > been in contact for 50 years and could not be traced using reasonable > diligence. This certainty of ownership will assist museums and galleries in > cataloguing and managing their collections.\\"Scottish Law Commission News > Release on Report on Prescription and Title to Moveable Property. Available: > https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/files/7913/3648/2203/nr_rep228.pdf ; > https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/reports/2010-present/ . As of 2020, the recommendations of this Report have not been implemented into legislation by the Scottish Parliament.  Acquisition of Possession  There are two requirements for acquisition of possession: = (1) Act of the Body (Corpus possidendi) = The first requirement of possession is an act of body, or corpus, in which the possessor physically detains the property. There are said to be two forms of the physical act, or corpus: (1) natural possession and (2) civil possession. Both forms require some form of physical contact. With civil possession, the possessor is in indirect physical control of the property,Draft Common Frame Reference Book VIII - 1:205(3) Civil possession can apply to both heritable and moveable property (excluding incorporeal property, see below) eg: Peter rents a shop from a commercial landlord, Peter's natural possession gives his landlord civil possession. In natural possession, the possessor alone has direct physical control,Draft Common Frame Reference Book VIII - 1:205(2) eg: Susan buys a vase and collects it from the shop, Susan has natural possession of the vase. = (2) Act of the Mind (Animus possidendi) = The second requirement for possession to occur is an act of the mind, or animus, in which the possessor must have the two requisite mental states.These are (1) the intention to exercise physical control of the property and (2) the intention to exercise control for their own benefit. Combining these two intentions together, the possessor is required to have the intention to exercise physical control of the property for their own use (in Latin: animus sibi habendi).Stair Institutions II,1,17 Without the mental element (animus), a holder is said to be a custodian of property and not a possessor, and does not have the right to possess the property (ius possesendi). Traditionally in Scots law, and following from Roman law, the test for animus was whether the possessor had the mental element of possession as owner (animo domini).Erskine Institute II,1,20 and in Bell Principles s 1311 The result was that occupiers of the property, such as lessees (ie: leaseholders) could not be said to acquire possession. However, the modern test for the act of the mind is now broader, allowing non-owners, including thieves, to acquire possession.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 125. Other jurisdictions such as English law allows any holder of property to be considered possessor except employees and temporary holders. Unlike ownership in Scots law, which is a unititular, or allodial, right, possession can be held by separate individuals, eg: a tenant can possess a flat for herself and possess the flat on the landlord's behalf.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 125. Following Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police v Sharp2002 SLT (Sh Ct), because unlawful takers of property are capable of acquiring possession (see below) there is no requirement that the acquiring is in good faith (bona fide). Following an act of the body and an act of the mind, the holder of the property acquires possession under Scots law. Possession of property can continue thereafter animo solo (by act of the mind alone), so the property does not require continued physical, direct or indirect, control in order to continue possession.  Presumption of Possession  Where possession has occurred, irrespective of the lawful or unlawful acquisition of the property (see below), the possessor is entitled to two presumptions in Scots law. These are (1) the possessor is a lawful possessor and (2) the possessor is the owner of the property. In other jurisdictions, these presumptions are characterised by the phrase 'possession is nine-tenths of the law'.  Forms of Possession  Due to the rules for the acquisition of possession, it follows that there are three main forms of possession: = (1) Natural Possession = A possessor can be in natural possession where they hold the property personally. eg: David finds a wallet on the ground in the street and decides to keep it. David is in natural possession of the wallet. = (2) Civil Possession = A possessor can be in civil possession where they hold property through the natural possession of another individual. eg: Susan buys a vase from a shop but informs the shopkeeper she will collect it later. She later asks Margaret to collect the vase from the shop on her behalf, Susan is said to have civil possession of the vase. = (3) Possession animo solo = A possessor can still be in possession of an object without physical (corpus) control over the property. This is possession animo solo, where possession is retained by act of the mind alone. eg: Susan leaves her vase in her house while she goes to the shop. Susan is still in possession of the vase by possession animo solo. = Lawful and Unlawful Possession = A further distinction is also made in possession between possessors who have acquired possession lawfully and possessors who take natural possession of the property unlawfully. Possessors who acquire possession lawfully, such as by the methods of delivery (see below), are known as lawful possessors. Possessors who acquire possession unlawfully, such as by theft, are termed unlawful possessors.Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p. 158\\\\. . OCLC 841186342. It is recognised that unlawful dispossession occurs where the property has been taken without the consent of the possessor, or without a judicial court order authorising removal of the property from the possessor.J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' (2011)2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22 , 32.  Voluntary Transfers of Possession (Delivery)  Possession is capable of voluntary transfer (termed delivery in Scots law) by either (1) actual delivery or (2) constructive delivery. The rules relating to transfer of possession derive from Roman law and are similar to the methods of transfer of ownership of corporeal moveable property. = Actual Delivery = Actual delivery is the physical transfer of property from the possessor personally to a new possessor. = Constructive Delivery = Transfers of possession are capable of being transferred by operation of the law and are known as constructive delivery. The following methods of constructive delivery (ie: transfers of possession recognised by law) are:  (1) Delivery by a natural Possessor  This form of delivery of possession commonly occurs where a natural possessor (B) holds property for a civil possessor (A) and, with the authorisation of the civll possessor, transfers the property to a new possessor (C) by operation of constructive delivery. > Eg: Susan returns to the shop (see above) and buys three picture frames and > informs the shopkeeper she will collect the frames another day, placing the > shopkeeper in natural possession of the frames. She later meets Margaret and > decides to let her have one of the picture frames as a gift to say thank you > for collecting her vase. Susan phones the shop and tells the shopkeeper to > put one of her picture frames aside for Margaret. Margaret goes to the shop > and collects the frame. Margaret has acquired possession by constructive > delivery.  (2) Shorthand Delivery (Delivery brevi manu)  Delivery brevi manu , or shorthand delivery, occurs where a natural possessor holds the property owned by another (the civil possessor) and the civil possessor subsequently transfers ownership to the natural possessor, thereby vesting the natural possessor with full possession. In these circumstances, the natural possessor's physical act (the corpus) occurs before the required animus _(_ the act of the mind). > Eg: Susan goes to the shop and buys a necklace and takes it home with her. > She later meets her niece Ishbel and decides to loan Ishbel the necklace to > wear to a cocktail party, placing Ishbel in natural possession of the > necklace while Susan retains civil possession. The next day, Ishbel phones > Susan to thank her for the loan. To Ishbel's surprise, Susan says she can > keep the necklace as a gift. Ishbel has acquired full possession by > shorthand delivery.  (3) Longhand Delivery (Delivery longa manu _)_  Delivery longa manu, or longhand delivery, occurs where large or bulky property cannot be physically acquired by actual delivery easily. Instead, possession can be transferred by the longhand, in which the corpus (or physical act) is reduced to mere pointing or symbolic delivery alone. Possession by the longhand = Pointing = Delivery longa manu to a new possessor is capable by pointing at the property alone. As Nicholas describes: > \\"If I wish to give you possession of a pile of logs, it is sufficient if I > point them out to you; to require that you should touch them would simply be > pedantic\\" This rule allows property such as land or large moveable property to be easily passed by sufficient identification alone. = Symbols = Delivery longa manu of property to a new possessor is also capable through the transfer of possession of a symbol of the property. The most common example, cited in Roman texts, is a warehouse of goods with the goods transferred by the symbolic delivery of a key to the warehouse. In Scots law, symbolic delivery of possession commonly occurs by transfer of the bill of lading of shipped goods.Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p. 159\\\\. . OCLC 841186342  (4) Constitutum Possessorium (Delivery by the mind alone/animo solo)  Constitutum Possessorium (ie: a possessory agreement) is viewed as the inverse of delivery brevi manu by allowing the divested possessor to retain natural possession, but civil possession is given to the new possessor.Nicholas, Barry. (1962). An introduction to Roman law. Oxford: Clarendon Press. p. 119\\\\. . OCLC 877760. > Eg: Ishbel sells her necklace to James as gift for his wife's birthday. > However, James does not want his wife to find the necklace at home so he > asks Ishbel to keep the necklace until closer to his wife's birthday. > Ishbell agrees. James has acquired civil possession by constitutum > possessorium (possessory agreement)  The real right to possess (Ius possisendi)  As discussed above, possession is traditionally viewed as a state of fact rather than a legal right. This follows the Roman law's principles that possession is a factual matter that gives rise to certain legal rights and remedies. However, certain possessors may also have an additional legal right to possess known as the ius possisendi (the right to possess). It is now generally viewed that the ius possisendi is a real right in Scots law, although there is little legal authority on the issue.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 127. Those without the real right of possession (the ius possisendi) have only a personal right (or right in personam) to possess the property. However, as will be explained, the real right of ius possisendi is not an autonomous standalone right in itself.Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p. 159\\\\. . OCLC 841186342. = Acquisition of the ius possisendi = The ius possisendi is not a free standing real right in its own right, unlike all other real rights falling within the numerus clausus. Instead the ius possisendi is dependent upon an individual holding another real right in the property that entitles them to possession, ie: the ius possisendi cannot be acquired in its own right. This is commonly the case with ownership, where it is recognised that an owner has the derivative right to possession (ius possisendi) in the property he owns. With inferior real rights, the ius possisendi can be granted through a real right in lease or liferent in the property. = Remedies Available Under the real right to possess (Ius possisendi) = Whilst a general remedy is available to possessors who have been unlawfully deprived of possession, known generally as the action of spuilzie (see below), additional special possessory remedies are granted to the holders of the ius possisendi. These are:Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p. 170\\\\. . OCLC 841186342. * For corporeal moveables, an action for delivery. * For corporeal heritable property (land), the action of removal. NB: Removal proceedings are brought where the current possessor never had consent to occupy the land from the ius possisendi rightholder ab initio (ie: from the beginning). This is commonly the case with squatters. * For corporeal heritable property (land), the action of ejection. NB: Ejection proceedings are brought where the current possessor no longer has consent from the ius possisendi rightholder to occupy the land. This commonly occurs after a commercial tenant remains on the land after the expiration of a lease. Residential leases are dealt with under eviction proceedings in the First Tier Tribunal for Scotland (Housing Chamber).Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016 * For corporeal heritable property (land), the action of trespass. Contrary to popular belief, trespass is a delict in Scots law.  Property Capable of Possession  Corporeal Heritable Property (Land) = In order to become a possessor of corporeal heritable property (ie: land), Viscount Stair, the institutional writer, says that: > \\"He who possessth a field, need not go about it all, or touch every turf of > it, by himself or his cattle, but by possessing a part, possesseth the > whole, unless there were contrary possessory acts\\"Stair II, 1, 18. This means that under Scots law, where there is a large area of land, continued possession of a single part of the plot of land will allow possession to extend to cover the entire plot, eg: possessing a house extends to possess the gardens that is part of the house's land. However, where there is a contrary possessory acts, such as another individual taking possession, that part of the land will not be considered as falling under the possessor's possession, eg: a squatter takes up camp in the garden of the house with the intent to encamp there, the squatter acquires possession by corpus and animus. The possessor of the house is no longer in possession of the garden. = Corporeal Moveable Property = Corporeal moveables, ie: property which can be physically moved such as personal items, furniture, cars etc. can be possessed with an animus and corpus. Possession of corporeal moveable property is relevant in Scots criminal law with criminal offences involving possession; such as those relating to drugs, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, for possession of an illegal substance,Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 s.5 or theft. However, it is argued by distinguished Scots law academics such as Gordon that the definition of possession in Scots criminal law is wider than its definition in Scots property law.G H Gordon The Criminal Law of Scotland (2nd edn, 1978) paras 3-38, 8-25. = Incorporeal Property = Due to the physical requirement of a corpus for possession to occur in Scots law, incorporeal property is not considered capable of possession. However, a real right may still be vested in an individual, such as ownership of the incorporeal thing. Additionally, statutes may create special statutory rights, or quasi real rights, in property, such as intellectual property rights (eg: patents, copyright, trademarks) that have the ability to be 'possessed' in a technical sense, albeit not a legal one due to the absence of corpus.Eg: Copyright, Designs and Patent Act 1998.  Loss of Possession (Spuilzie) and the Action of Spuilzie  Spuilzie = A spuilzie occurs where a possessor is unlawfully deprived of possession (also termed an unlawful dispossession) of corporeal moveables (ie: physical objects that can be moved) property. An unlawful dispossession is where possession is taken without the consent of the current possessor or without a court order. The word spuilzie is Scots for spoilation.Scottish Law Commission, Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976). Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion- papers-and-consultative-memoranda/1970-1979/ The injured possessor can seek return of the item by an action of spuilzie in Scots law. Viscount Stair, the institutional writer, describes a spuilzie as: > \\"'the taking away of moveables without consent of the owner or order of law, > obliging to restitution of the things taken away, with all possible profits, > or to reparation therefor according to the estimation of the injured, made > by his juramentum in litem [ie: 'oath in the action'] . Thus, things stolen > or robbed ... may be civilly pursued for as spuilzie\\"Stair I.9.16. The institutional writer, Erskine, writes that: > \\"Spuilzie is the taking away or intermeddling with moveable goods in the > possession of another, without either the consent of that other, or the > order of law. When a spuilzie is committed, action lies against the > delinquent, not only for restoring to the former possessor the goods or > their value, but for all the profits he might have made of these goods, had > it not been for the spuilzie,\\"Erskine III, 7, 16. = Special Forms of Spuilzie = Ejection  Where a possessor is unlawfully dispossessed of land, this form of an action of spuilzie is known as ejection.Stair I, 9, 25‚Äì27. A full discussion of ejection is beyond the scope of this article but ejection is different from eviction, which is a legal process commonly used to remove tenants under a lease.  Intrusion  Where possession is held animo solo (ie: by the mind alone), which commonly occurs when the possessors stops having physical control (corpus) over the property, this form of an action of spuilzie is termed an intrusion.Stair I, 9, 25‚Äì27. = Raising an Action of Spuilzie = The action of spuilzie, as noted by the institutional writers above, is a common law remedy developed by the Scottish courts to address spuilzies. It is a delictual remedy rather than a proprietary remedy as there is no autonomous real right of possession, so is enforceable against the dispossessor/s alone as a personal right in favour of the prior possessor.Scottish Law Commission, Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976), page 19. Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/1970-1979/ The availability of such a remedy follows the principle spoliatus ante omnia est restituendus (Latin: 'he who has been despoiled must receive restitution before anything else'), a principle which has been incorporated in Scots law since at least the 13th century.DM Walker, A Legal History of Scotland, Vol II (W Green, Edinburgh 1990) at p. 619. Similar legal remedies exist in other jurisdictions such as the mandament van spolie in South Africa or the tort of conversion in common law jurisdictions.Scottish Law Commission, Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976), page 19. Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and- consultative-memoranda/1970-1979/  History  Spuilzie is one of the oldest legal remedies found in Scots law, and is of continued relevance in modern times. Its earliest origins in Scotland can be found in 1438, when the King's Council developed a legal remedy for robbery and spoilations, later coming to be known as the action of spuilzie.RPS A1438/12/1. Available: https://www.rps.ac.uk/trans/A1438/12/1. In Roman law, similar remedies existed known as the actio a bonorum raptorum (Latin:'action for goods taken away by force'), the actio furti and possessory interdicts.Scottish Law Commission, Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976). Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/1970-1979/ Lord Bankton, the institutional writer, views the action of spuilzie as a derivative of the Roman possessory interdicts.Bankton, Institute of the Laws of Scotland, II.1.31. However, because of the delictual nature of spuilzie it may be seen as a combination of all three remedies.J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' 2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22 (2011), 22. In Canon law, the exceptio spolii was a legal remedy allowing expelled bishops the legal right to recover their possessions.J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' 2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22 (2011), 22. The remedy was said to have developed because of the lawless nature and instability of the Kingdom of Scotland,Scottish Law Commission, Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976), page 16. Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/1970-1979/ as Dr Gow describes: > \\"[spuilzie] a remedy which appears to have been used for the protection of > actual possession and maintenance of the public peace in a country more > notable for civil unrest and military punitive expeditions than bourgeois > placidity.\\" An early case can be identified in the 16th century in The Laird of Durie v Duddingstonn (1549) where the court noted that a tenant was dispossessed of corporeal heritable property (land) by being driven from the land by squatters, the landlord could raise an action of spuilzie against the squatters.(1549) Mor 14735 In the 17th century, actions of spuilzie were at their highest usage.Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 161. However, over time the usage of actions of spuizlie declined, attributable to the increasing stability of Scottish civic society (leading to less high-value property being unlawful dispossessed).Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, Vol 18, Property, Ch 4, Possession, para 161.  Requirements of an Action of Spuilzie  In order to bring an action of spuilzie against a dispossessor (ie: the person who has unlawfully acquired natural possession), two general requirements must be met: (1) The prior possessor had acquired possession (see above),NB: J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' (2011) 2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22 , 30. and (2) The prior possessor was unlawfully, also termed vitiously, dispossessed. Unlawful in this sense meaning the taking without consent, or without a court order authorising such takings. Consent by the natural possessor will prevent any claim being brought by a civil possessor.Stair I, 9, 20 and IV, 28, 7. The pursuer in an action of spuilzie must demonstrate to the court that on the balance of probabilities, these two requirements have been met. Pending further case law on the issue, it is a matter of academic debate if civil possession alone is sufficient to raise an action of spuilzie in relation to corporeal moveables.J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' (2011) 2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22 , 30. However it is immaterial in an action of spuilzie whether the prior possessor had acquired possession lawfully/unlawfully.Stair Institutions I,9,17; IV,28,2; Bankton Institute I,10,126; Erskine Institute IV,1,15. The remedy is therefore considered to be open to all possessors of land and natural possessors of corporeal moveables, including those who acquired possession themselves unlawfully (such as a thief) and can even be used against the owner of property too. As Lord Bankton, the institutional writer notes: > \\"The pursuer's title, in an action of spuilie [sic], is possession of the > goods ... and if the possession was peaceable, even the true owner, seizing > the goods from the possessor, will be liable in a spuilie ... The party that > is violently deprived of the possession must be first restored, and then the > question of property considered ...\\"Bankton I,10,126. However, in practice an owner of property can concurrently raise proceedings of an action of vindication (vindicatio) or similar proceedings to recover ownership of the property so the use of an action of spuilzie is limited against an owner. Yet, in theory, it is legally valid to raise an action of spuilzie against an owner as spuilzie focuses on possession alone.  Remedies Available  There are two broad remedies available to a pursuer in an action of spuilzie. These are: = Return of the Property = As the institutional writers above mention, the main remedy available under an action of spuilzie is the return (termed restitution) of the property from the dispossessor to the prior possessor. = Compensation = Again, as the institutional writers above mention, compensation of all possible profit are also available to the prior possessor. Two forms of profits are available. The first is ordinary profits, these are payable in respect of any profits made from the property (such as fruits, crops, young, rents etc.) The second form of damages, termed by the institutional writers as violent profits are a general exception that Scots law does not allow for punitive damages. Violent profits are determined by the highest possible level of income that a property can make.Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p 169. . OCLC 841186342. Special forms of violent profits are available in relation to ejections of unlawful possessors of land.Gretton, George Lidderdale,. Property, trusts and succession. Steven, Andrew J. M., (Second edition ed.). Haywards Heath, West Sussex. p 169. . OCLC 841186342.  Modern Usage of Actions of Spuilzie  As discussed above, spuilzie has fallen into decline in modern times, with no known express action of spuilzie being reported in over two hundred years since Stove v Colvin (1831)(1831) 9 S 633.J.

Available: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/1970-1979/ However, as the action of spuilzie has not been expressly abolished it remains a valid legal remedy in Scots law.McKendrick v Sinclair 1972 SLT 110 The Scottish Law Commission, in its memorandum on corporeal moveable remedies (SLC Memorandum No 31, 1976), expressed the following view on spuilzie: > \\"We think that the action of spuilzie provided useful redress in promptly > restoring a person who had been wrongfully deprived of or excluded from > possession, and also in giving violent profits in appropriate cases. > However, the invocation of ancient remedies of uncertain scope is not > necessarily the ideal solution for modern wrongs. It seems to us that the > delict of spuilzie, of uncertain competence and scope, should probably be > expressly abolished, and consideration be given to what, if any, action or > actions should be introduced in its place.\\"Scottish Law Commission, > Corporeal Moveables: Remedies, Memo No. 31 (1976), page 19. Available: > https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and- > consultative-memoranda/1970-1979/ Other reforms have been called for regarding legislation on its usage or express abolition of the common-law remedy altogether.J. Townsend, 'Raising Lazarus: Why Spuilzie Should Be Resurrected' (2011) 2 Aberdeen Student L. Rev. 22, 48. However, it has been noted that the use of spuilzie may have modern efficacy in relations to natural possessors of property under hire-purchase agreements, where the natural possessor will often have no legal right of ownership to the hired property.A. Rodger, 'Spuilzie in the Modern World' (1970) Scots Law Times 33. To date, no reforms of spuilzie have taken place by the Scottish Parliament, so the raising of an action of spuilzie remains valid.  Application of Possession in Scots Law  The concept of possession extends beyond Scots property law and is applicable in a variety of legal settings. These include: * Possession is a necessary requirement for the operation of positive prescription. * One year's possession is a necessary requirement for an application for a prescriptive claim. * Possession is a necessary requirement for the operation of original acquisition of property by occupatio. * The real right of lease requires possession in order to register it under the Registration of Leases Act 1880. * Possession is relevant in Scots criminal law in relation to a range of possessory offences such as possession of unlawful substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

Filmed in 16 mm, ABC da Greve records the effervescence of the labor movement, which mobilized to carry out the first strikes in Brazil since 1968 and preceded the country's political amnesty and redemocratization.

It is located in Suceava in northern Romania, in the region of Bukovina. The Armenian monastery was completed in the early part of the 15th century during the reign of Moldavian Hospodar Alexandru I Mu»ôat). It was constructed with the intent of being the bishop's seat for the local Armenian church in 1401 which was founded by Alexandru I. Saint Auxentius Church was designed to be the center of the complex. The church was renovated or rebuilt in 1606, at which time a number of other structures were added, among them the belltower, the gate, as well as a residential structure with a chapel to Gregory the Illuminator which all survive into to the present day. The interior of the church was decorated with murals in the 18th century. When James Louis Sobieski attempted to ascend to the Moldavian throne, his base of operations was the Armenian monastery of Suceava. Beginning in 1690, the monastery became the headquarters of the Polish Army for all of their operations in Moldavia related to Poland's participation in the War of the Holy League against the Ottoman Empire. Staying at the monastery for several years, the Poles built an extensive network of bastion fortifications which are well preserved to this day. The popular name of the monastery, \\"Zamca\\", likely comes from this period and is derived from , the Polish word for castle.  Bibliography  * W. Korsak, J.

She has said of her decision to pivot: On recording the album, she has recalled: Composition The alternative rock, grunge, and punk rock album is approximately 42 minutes, 48 second in length. Billboard Brandon Voss described the album as \\"guitar-fueled\\". Musically, Adore Delano was inspired by the music of Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, including Kurt Cobain, Courtney Love, and Babes in Toyland. The song \\"27 Club\\" refers to the numerical cultural phenomenon of the same name, a list of famous people who died at the age of 27. Adore Delano penned the song \\"out of a genuine place of fear -- she had been experimenting with drugs and knew that her habits could make her the club's newest member\\". According to Sam Chapman of Alternative Press, the song's lyrics \\"hint at the mental turbulence that drove much of the record and Delano's relocation to Seattle in the first place\\".

Nearing the completion of his bachelor's degree, he was awarded the Nanyang President's Graduate Scholarship, which offered him the opportunity to pursue a four-years PhD programme in Nanyang Technological University with full financial support and allowances. In June 2012, he graduated with a first-class honours. In August 2012, he commenced his PhD studies with Vinh Thai. His initial research topic was related to solving supply chain quality management issues in the maritime industry. However, he made the decision to switch to sustainable shipping management, which was expected to be the key focus of the maritime industry for the next few decades. During the course of his PhD studies, he attended several international conferences organised by International Association of Maritime Economist and Quality Management and Organisational Development Conference. His conference papers presented at the latter were selected as best papers for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015. Consequently, the papers were published in the special issues linked to the conference. At the time of his graduation which was in July 2017, he had published several journal papers indexed by Web of Science. =Academic career (2017 - present)= Yuen began his career as an assistant professor at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea. He spent two and a half years at the university teaching maritime transport, transport logistics and economics, innovation logistics, principle of economics, statistics, and multivariate data analysis in English. Subsequently, he moved to Nanyang Technological University in Jan 2020, teaching quality management in shipping, shipping and the environment, maritime economics and maritime strategy. Academic contribution Yuen's research straddles across several management fields: quality management; consumer behaviour; sustainable management; technology and innovation management. =Quality management= He introduces and tests the presence of interaction effects among service quality attributes. The interactions are noted to contain additive, synergistic or compensatory effects on customer satisfaction. This finding supports and extends Kano model which mainly considers the linear and non-linear effects of an attribute but not the interaction effects of different attributes. =Consumer behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic= He reviews the psychological causes influencing the spread of panic buying. Panic buying is a niche area of consumer behavioural studies that has gained renewed attention from academics in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The review shows that panic buying is influenced by (1) perceived threat and scarcity of products;(2) fear of the unknown;(3) coping behaviour and (4) social influence and social trust. His comments on the causes for delays in delivery orders caused by the pandemic are also published on Today (Singapore newspaper). =Sustainable management= His research mainly links sustainable management with organisational performance. This includes examining its critical success factors, antecedents, contingency factors, implementation strategy and influence on stakeholders' satisfaction and loyalty. =Technology and innovation management= His research has examined the spread and management of innovation or technology adoption in a society in various contexts such as augmented reality applications, self-collection technologies and autonomous vehicles References Category:Nanyang Technological University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people ","title":"Yuen Kum Fai"},{"id":"64124350","text":"Hugh de Lowther of Lowther and Newton Reigny, was an English noble and administrator.

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. HistoryEarly history= The house was built for the painter, Christian Peter Getreuer in 1738-39. Getreuer was appointed court painter in 1749. He owned the building until his death in 1780. Jens Gi√∏dwad, a journalist and future editor of the newspaper F√¶drelandet, was a resident of the building in the late 1830s. =Rostrup family= Kasper Rostrup's home at Valkendorfsgade 36 seen on a drawing by Emil Rostrup, 1900 Nicolai Peter Rostrup, owner of N. P. ROSTRUP, a coffin manufacturer and retailer founded in 1844, who acquired the building in 1865, made it is family home and also ran his business from the premises. Rostrp's son, Kaspar Rostrup, an attorney, continued the business after his father's death, qualifying as a master joiner in 1866. N. P. Rostrup was after Kaspar Rostrup's death continued by his son Aage Rostrup and after his death in 1946 by his widow Anne Rostrup. The firm was based at Valkendorfsgade 36 into at least the 1950s. FDF rented a 4-room apartment on the second floor from April 1916. In 1942 the organisation moved to larger premises at Frederiksborggade 5. Architecture One of Johan Cornelius Krieger's fire houses The building was in its original form an example of one of the large version of Johan Cornelius Krieger's so-called fire house designs. After the Great Fire of 1728, Krieger was instructed to create a number of generic designs which were to serve as inspiration for craftsmen in connection with the rebuilding of the city. Architects were in that day only engaged in individual construction projects by the crown and nobility. Valkendorfsgade 36 was then an eight bays widethree-storey building with a prominent gabled wall dormer. The building was in 1886 heightened by one floor on each side of the wall dormer. Main entrance The facade towards the street is constructed in brick. It is painted in a reddish-brown colour with white decorative details. The facade is decorated with four quoin lesenes supported by Fleur-de-lis ornaments at the transition between the raised cellar and ground floor. The building's original cornice Is still seen between the third and fourth floor, highlighting the transition between the old and new part of the facade. The main entrance in the southernmost bay is raised four steps from street level. The keystone above the main entrance features Getreuer's coat of arms as well as the year \\"1739\\". The roof is clad with red tile. The keystone A rear wing projects from the rear side of the building. The facade towards the yard m both of the main wing and the side wing, is constructed with timber framing. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. It was restored in 2018. The restoration work received a bronze medal at the Renover Awards. Today The building is still owned by the Rostrup (Rostrup Tjalve) family. A restaurant is now based in the ground floor of the building. A kindergarten is based on the first floor.

She also claimed that Jesus told her that the torments of hell are suffered according to one's sins; for example, the vision of Satan is worst for doers of worst sins.Visions of Hell: St. Catherine of Siena =Faustina= Saint Faustina claimed to have had visited the \\"chasms of hell\\" when her guardian angel took her there, where she saw many people who disbelieved in the existence of hell.Divine Mercy In My Soul, 741 Faustina also claimed to have seen Catholic nuns in hell for breaking their vows of silence,Divine Mercy In My Soul, 118 as well as souls whom God had marked for great holiness.Divine Mercy In My Soul, 1556 She further claimed that Jesus told her that, when a sinner repents of sin, Satan flies away to the bottom of hell in fear,Divine Mercy In My Soul, 378 and that, when a soul is damned, it plunges Jesus into mortal agony.Divine Mercy In My Soul, 580 =John Bosco= John Bosco claimed to have dreamed about hell.

Victory at all costs!\\" (29 April 1942) \\"The Jew Kaufman triumphs!\\" (19 August 1942) Parole der Woche (\\"Slogan of the Week\\" or \\"Word of the Week\\") was a wall newspaper published by the (propaganda department of the Nazi Party) from 1937 to 1944. Historian Jeffrey Herf describes Parole der Woche as \\"the most ubiquitous and intrusive aspect of Nazism‚Äôs visual offensive... no form of Nazi visual propaganda made so crucial a contribution to the regime‚Äôs presentation of ongoing events\\". Establishment Criticizes the bombing of Germany as a \\"criminal act\\" (18 November 1940) Herf suggests that the Nazi artist Hans Schweitzer was influential in the establishment of Parole der Woche, which began to publish in October 1937. An article in Unser Wille und Weg, the internal newsletter of the RPL, stated in June 1936: On 23 September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels emphasized the importance of posters to Nazi propaganda efforts, \\"above all\\" Parole der Woche. Themes and influence \\"Whoever wears this sign is an enemy of our people\\", from the 1 July 1942 issue Parole der Woche combined multiple styles including those of editorials, leaflets, posters, and tabloid journalism. Although antisemitism was marginal in Parole der Woche until 1940, it later became a major theme, with one-third of the posters from 1941 to 1943 expressing antisemitism. Six issues dealt with Germany Must Perish! and the supposed Jewish-Allied intention to exterminate the German population. The posters repeatedly accused Jews of starting the war and intending to exterminate Germans. On the day before the German declaration of war against the United States, Parole der Woche published an issue with a chart showing the supposed international Jewish conspiracy which connected Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Herf argues that to Germans who had no other sources of information, \\"The image and text of the wall newspaper offered a seemingly compelling explanation of how the Jews, so few in number, could have been so successful in plotting against Germany.\\" In this poster and others, antisemitism was combined with anti-Americanism, Anglophobia, and the conspiracy theory of Jewish Bolshevism. The posters were published at the size of , or alternatively , in landscape. They were designed to be read by multiple people simultaneously from a distance of a few feet and used colors and graphics to attract, even compel, attention. Along with the posters, the Nazi Party also published miniature versions the size of playing cards, which were often attached to official communications. Around 125,000 poster-size copies were printed of each issue and posted in \\"every imaginable public place\\", such that, according to Herf, people in Germany \\"could not avoid\\" seeing it. In Spring/Summer 1940, the Nazi Party reported that there were 63,121 orders for the poster: 34,635 from the German Labor Front, 10,940 from doctors' organizations, and 5,960 from the owners of bars, restaurants, and similar businesses. Spoof Spoof version \\"blow upon blow\\" \\"Murderer from Berchtesgaden!\\" leaflet From 1942 to 1945, small-sized spoof versions were produced as black propaganda by the Political Warfare Executive and dropped by Allied aircraft over Germany. On 11 March 1943, Allied aircraft distributed a leaflet about German victory: Propaganda Warfare Executive manager Sefton Delmer wrote that this leaflet was a deliberate parody of a similar genuine Parole der Woche leaflet which spoke of actual German victories. In late 1943, one of these leaflets contained a quote misattributed to Hitler: \\"If the German people should collapse beneath its present burden, I would shed no tears for it - it would deserve its fate..\\" In 1944, one leaflet stated \\"We want a leader by the grace of God and not a murderer from Berchtesgaden!\\" This slogan became especially popular with anti-Nazi Germans and those who considered the war hopeless.

He was a \\"gentilhomme-servant du roi\\", meaning he was on the king's payroll, and a composer and violinist, Gazette du commerce (Paris. 1763)13 novembre 1783 : \\"M. de Monpas ex√©cuta son concerto de t√™te & en improvisant : il fut fort applaudi.\\" https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9782811w/f5.image.r=%22meude- monpas%22?rk=21459;2 as well as a member of several academies. Music Career Meude-Monpas was born in Paris and studied violin with Pierre Lahoussaye (1735-1818), and composition with Giroust, but later he pretended to be one of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's pupils because he shared the man's opinions and purported to be extremely sensitive. In 1786 Meude-Monpas published six concertos for violin, with 2 violins, viola, double bass, 2 oboes and 2 horns. Like many other members of the court, he left the country during the French Revolution and served for a time in a corps under the orders of the Prince de Cond√©. Later, Mme de Genlis met him in Berlin where he was writing and publishing poetry. She gave the poetry a bad review, an opinion shared by Framery. who criticized it as ignorant and absurd in the Mercure de France (ann. 1788, n.26). On May 5, 1790, Meude-Monpas had an impromptu published in which he suggested that the Duke of Aiguillon had dressed as a woman to take part in the Women's March on Versailles (this was a preexisting legend) : \\"We have been transported to miraculous times. / While d'Aiguil ... disguises himself as a woman, / Antoinette becomes a brave man, / Worthy of honouring the noble blood of the House of Guise.\\"\\"Nous sommes transport√©s aux temps miraculeux./ Tandis que d'Aiguil,.. en femme se d√©guise,/ Antoinette devient un homme courageux / Et digne d'honorer le noble sang des Guise\\". Meude-Monpas denied that he had been referring to the duke and on May 23, the Marquis de Condorcet's Chronique de Paris jeered at him and reminded the public that Meude-Monpas was a self-styled \\"chevalier\\" - in fact the son of a master goldsmith in Paris, a Mr. Josse \\"who would be amazed to see his youngest son has become a gentleman-servant and a chevalier (knight) in spite of his ancestors, and the Don Quixote of dukes, marquis and counts, his noble peers and friends.\\" https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k772638k/f3.item.r=%22meude- monpas%22.zoom An article by Camille Pelletan in Georges Clemenceau's newspaper La Justice published on April 29, 1889, describes a counter- revolutionary newspaper called \\"Le petit Gautier\\" or, more officially, Le Journal de la cour et de la ville. Fran√ßois Jourgniac de Saint-M√©ard (1745-1827) and Jean-Olivier de Meude-Moupas were notable contributors. Personal Life Meude-Monpas was known as a staunch supporter of Louis XVI and had a public reputation. Nearly a century later, he became a character in a play by Edmond de Goncourt, La Patrie en Danger, drame en cinq actes, en prose, premiered on March 19, 1889 at the Th√©√¢tre Libre, salle des Menus- Plaisirs.

Nebraska competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, in the West Division of the Big Ten. Nebraska plays its home games at Memorial Stadium, where it has sold out every game since 1962. The team is currently coached by Scott Frost. Nebraska is among the most storied programs in college football history. As of the end of the 2019 season, the Cornhuskers rank seventh in all-time victories among FBS teams.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2019/FBS.pdf Nebraska claims 46 conference championships and five national championships (1970, 1971, 1994, 1995, and 1997), and has won nine other national championships that the school does not claim. NU's 1971 and 1995 title-winning teams are considered to be among the best in college football history. Famous Cornhuskers include Heisman Trophy winners Johnny Rodgers, Mike Rozier, and Eric Crouch, who join 22 other Cornhuskers in the College Football Hall of Fame. Notable among these are players Bob Brown, Guy Chamberlin, Tommie Frazier, Rich Glover, Dave Rimington, and Will Shields, and coaches Bob Devaney and Tom Osborne. The program's first extended period of success came just after the turn of the century. Between 1900 and 1916, Nebraska had five undefeated seasons and completed a stretch of 34 consecutive games without a loss, still a program record. Despite a span of 21 conference championships in 33 seasons, the Cornhuskers didn't experience major national success until Bob Devaney was hired in 1962. In eleven seasons as head coach, Devaney won two national championships, eight conference titles, and coached 22 All-Americans, but perhaps his most lasting achievement was the hiring of Tom Osborne as offensive coordinator in 1969. Osborne was named Devaney's successor in 1973, and over the next 25 years established himself as one of the best coaches in college football history with his trademark I-form offense and revolutionary strength, conditioning, and nutrition programs. Following Osborne's retirement in 1997, Nebraska cycled through four head coaches before hiring state native Scott Frost in 2017. The early yearsProgram beginnings (1890‚Äì99)= Nebraska's football history began in 1890 as the \\"Old Gold Knights\\", which was changed to \\"Bugeaters\\" just two years later. \\"Cornhuskers\\" first appeared in an 1893 school newspaper headline (\\"We Have Met The Cornhuskers And They Are Ours\\") after an upset victory over Iowa. In this instance, \\"Cornhuskers\\" was used to derogatorily refer to Iowa. Nebraska State Journal writer Cy Sherman, who would later help create college football's AP Poll, was the first to use the term in reference to Nebraska; the nickname caught on quickly and was officially adopted in 1900. 1890 Nebraska Old Gold Knights, the University of Nebraska's first football team Dr. Langdon Frothingham, a newly hired veterinary pathologist from Harvard, coached the school's first season; the main reason for this was that he had brought a football with him from the East Coast. Nebraska's first game was a 10‚Äì0 Thanksgiving Day victory over the Omaha YMCA on November 27, 1890. Frothingham broke his leg during a practice prior to the season's only other game, an 18‚Äì0 win over Doane that actually took place in February 1891. He returned to Massachusetts after the season, leaving Nebraska without a coach. Prior to NU's 1891 matchup with Iowa, however, the Hawkeyes sent Iowa College coach Theron Lyman to Lincoln to help Nebraska prepare for the more experienced Hawkeyes. Nebraska credits Lyman as its coach for the game, though he likely did not even attend Iowa's 22‚Äì0 win. In the middle of the 1892 season, Omaha attorney J.S. Williams began coaching the team. Williams' first and only game was a 1‚Äì0 forfeit victory over Missouri, after the Tigers refused to play due to the presence of African- American George Flippin on Nebraska's roster. Flippin was NU's first African- American athlete, and only the fifth black athlete at any predominantly white university. The forfeiture resulted in, technically, Nebraska's first-ever win against a conference opponent. Frank Crawford (1893‚Äì94, 9‚Äì4‚Äì1) became the school's first official football coach when he was hired in 1893. He has the unique distinction of being the first full-time head coach at both Nebraska and Michigan.(\\"He [Crawford] was the first football coach in University of Michigan history...\\") Under Crawford's leadership, NU won its first conference championship in 1894. He was a vocal critic of Flippin, his star player and an African-American. When Flippin was voted team captain by his teammates in 1893, Crawford vetoed the election, stating, \\"It takes a man with brains to be a captain; all there is to Flippin is brute force.\\" When Crawford left for Texas, assistant coach Charles Thomas (1895, 6‚Äì3) was named his replacement. Nebraska went 6‚Äì3 in his only season, winning the WIUFA for the second straight year. Walter C. Booth led Nebraska to 24 consecutive wins from 1901 to 1904 Nebraska was led by a pair of future College Football Hall of Fame head coaches over the next three seasons. While they both are better known for their tenures at other universities, Eddie N. Robinson (1896‚Äì97, 11‚Äì4‚Äì1) and Fielding H. Yost (1898, 8‚Äì3) led Nebraska to a combined 19‚Äì7‚Äì1 record from 1896 to 1898. Alonzo Edwin Branch (1899, 1‚Äì7‚Äì1) took over the program for the 1899 season, Nebraska's only losing season in its first 29 years of competition. =A Midwest power (1900‚Äì17)= Walter C. Booth (1900‚Äì05, 46‚Äì8‚Äì1) quickly turned Nebraska into a Midwest football power. At one point during his tenure, Booth's teams won 24 straight games, setting a program record that stood until 1995. His 1902 team outscored its opponents 186‚Äì0 en route to a 10‚Äì0 season. After another dominating season in 1903, it was written that Booth could \\"weep with Alexander the Great\\", given Nebraska's difficulty finding competitive and willing opposition in the Midwest. Booth retired in 1906, and a year later Nebraska hired W.C. Cole (1907‚Äì10, 25‚Äì8‚Äì3), a former player and assistant coach for Fielding Yost at Michigan. After nine seasons as an independent, Nebraska joined the MVIAA in 1907. NU's 16‚Äì6 win over Kansas in their lone conference game was enough to claim the MVIAA title in Cole's first season. During Cole's four-year tenure, Nebraska played its first season at Nebraska Field, the school's first venue designed to host football games. When the MVIAA passed legislation in 1910 requiring football coaches to be full-time faculty members, Cole resigned, feeling he could not manage his farm in Missoula while living year-round in Lincoln. In his final game as head coach, Nebraska beat Haskell 119‚Äì0 at Nebraska Field, still the largest margin of victory in program history. Coach Ewald O. Stiehm with the \\"Stiehm Roller\\" in 1920 Nebraska hired Ewald O. \\"Jumbo\\" Stiehm (1911‚Äì15, 25‚Äì8‚Äì3) to replace Cole. The fiery Stiehm was subject to such frequent outbursts that the school established a women's sitting section at Nebraska Field far from the home sideline. Despite his temperament, his \\"Stiehm Roller\\" teams were highly successful, winning the conference title each season and losing only two games during his five-year tenure. Under Stiehm's watch, Nebraska began a school- record 34-game unbeaten stretch and Guy Chamberlin was named the first All- American in program history. Led by Chamberlin, Nebraska finished the 1915 season undefeated, but the university declined an opportunity to play in the first Rose Bowl. Stiehm, who also coached Nebraska's basketball team to three conference championships, was offered $4,500 annually to take over Indiana's athletic department. Despite suggesting he'd remain at Nebraska for less money, the school refused to offer him a raise and Stiehm exited with the highest winning percentage of any coach in school history. E. J. Stewart (1916‚Äì17, 25‚Äì8‚Äì3) replaced Stiehm in 1916, but coached only two seasons before leaving to assist in the war effort (he later returned to coach Nebraska's basketball team). NU won its seventh- and eighth-consecutive MVIAA titles in Stewart's two years, though the school's 34-game unbeaten stretch came to an end in 1916. Stewart was instrumental in reestablishing Nebraska's baseball program, which had been dormant since 1912, and urged the university to schedule strong opponents across all sports to \\"add to Nebraska prestige throughout the United States\\". 1921 Nebraska Cornhuskers With its roster and coaching staff depleted by World War I and the Spanish flu pandemic, Nebraska turned to professor William G. Kline (1918, 2‚Äì3‚Äì1) to coach the shortened 1918 season. After the war, Nebraska played for two years independent of the MVIAA, during which Henry Schulte (1919‚Äì20, 2‚Äì3‚Äì1) took over coaching duties. Schulte was head coach for only two seasons, but stayed on staff until 1927, and led NU's track and field program until 1938. Nebraska named the Schulte Fieldhouse in his honor, which stood from its completion in 1946 until the Osborne Athletic Complex took its place in 2006. The first stretch of coaching stability in program history began with the hire of Fred Dawson (1921‚Äì24, 23‚Äì7‚Äì2) in 1921. Dawson's four-year tenure was most notable for NU's series of games against Notre Dame and legendary coach Knute Rockne. Nebraska's only loss during a dominant 1921 season was against the Irish, but the Cornhuskers returned the favor in 1922 and 1923, becoming the only team to defeat Notre Dame's famed Four Horsemen. The 1922 matchup was the final game played at Nebraska Field; with an estimated 16,000 fans it was also the highest- attended. Dawson coached Ed Weir, the program's first two-time All-American, and Link Lyman, the first Nebraska alumni elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He won three conference titles, although his final season marked the end of Nebraska's streak of 11 straight MVIAA titles (interrupted by 1918, when no official conference games were played, and the following two years, when NU played as an independent). =New stadium and sustained success (1923‚Äì41)= The southeast corner of Memorial Stadium bears an inscription to honor Nebraskans who died in World War I College football exploded in popularity in the years after World War I, and in 1922, Nebraska began raising funds to construct a larger stadium at the old Nebraska Field site. Construction on the $430,000 stadium, with an original capacity of 31,080, lasted just four months. On October 13, 1923, Nebraska defeated Oklahoma in the first game at Memorial Stadium, named to honor the Nebraskans who died in World War I (since expanded to include Nebraskans who died in World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War). Dana X. Bible in 1935 Dawson retired to become athletic director in 1925 and Robert Zuppke assistant Ernest E. Bearg (1925‚Äì28, 23‚Äì7‚Äì3) was named his replacement. Bearg won the first Big Six championship in 1928, but was frequently criticized by fans for \\"not using strategy and deception\\", and he resigned after the season. Nebraska tried to hire Rockne away from Notre Dame, but ultimately settled on another future Hall of Fame head coach, Dana X. Bible (1929‚Äì36, 50‚Äì15‚Äì7). Bible followed 11 highly successful years at Texas A&M; with six Big Six titles in eight years at Nebraska. His 1936 team was ranked No. 15 in the first AP Poll, and finished the year ninth. Bible coached four All-Americans at Nebraska and nearly won the program's first national title (though it would have been a retroactive selection) in 1933.Herschel Nissenson Tales From College Football's Sidelines (Sports Publishing LLC, 2001). Bible accepted a lucrative offer to coach Texas after the 1936 season, but assisted Nebraska in the search for his replacement, Biff Jones (1937‚Äì41, 28‚Äì14‚Äì4). Running back Sam Francis became Nebraska's first No. 1 overall selection in the NFL Draft in 1937. Jones served in World War I and coached at Army for four years, before stints at LSU and Oklahoma. He took NU to the program's first bowl game, a 21‚Äì13 loss to Stanford in the 1941 Rose Bowl. The following year, Nebraska lost five consecutive games for the first time ever, and Jones was recalled to serve in World War II just days after the last game of the season. Though Nebraska maintained Jones' position would still be available to him after the war, he remained at West Point for years after and never coached college football again. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1954. Nebraska's 25‚Äì9 victory over Kansas State in 1939 was broadcast locally in certain parts of the Manhattan area, making it the second televised college football game. =Slide into obscurity (1942‚Äì61)= Bobby Reynolds in 1951 The landscape of college football changed drastically during World War II, as most able-bodied men were drawn into the war effort in some way. While Nebraska was still able to field a team, something many other major programs could not do, the Cornhuskers had four straight losing seasons after only three in the program's first 51 years. The situation become so dire that athletic director George Clark (1945, 1948, 6‚Äì13‚Äì0), a veteran of both wars with an extensive coaching pedigree, had to step in to coach the 1948 season after retiring in 1945. During these years, center Tom Novak became Nebraska's first four-time all-conference selection, and later was the first player in program history to have his number retired. In 1950, Nebraska and new head coach Bill Glassford (1949‚Äì55, 50‚Äì40‚Äì4) played the school's first \\"spring game\\", a 13‚Äì13 draw between the varsity team and an alumni team. Led by 22 touchdowns from All-American Bobby Reynolds, NU had its first winning season since 1940 and finished the season ranked 17th. Glassford led the Cornhuskers during their first night game, a 19‚Äì7 loss to Miami in 1951, and college football's first \\"NCAA-regulated\\" telecast, a 20‚Äì12 loss to Oregon in 1953. The hard-nosed coach, who at one point had to overrule a player petition calling for his firing, took Nebraska to its second bowl game, a 34‚Äì7 loss to Duke in the 1955 Orange Bowl. Glassford resigned in 1955, but survived until 2014, when he died at 102 as the oldest-living professional football player. After a 4‚Äì6‚Äì1 1956 season under Pete Elliott, Nebraska hired 29-year-old Bill Jennings (1957‚Äì61, 15‚Äì34‚Äì1) to lead the program. Jennings had no winning seasons in five years as head coach, but was responsible for Nebraska's upset victory over Oklahoma in 1959, which ended OU's 74-game conference winning streak. He frequently found himself at odds with program supporters, at one point stating, \\"There is an intense desire to do something good in this state, like elect a president or gain prominence in politics. But we can't feed the ego of the state of Nebraska with the football team.\\" Jennings' last season in 1961 would be Nebraska's last losing season until 2004. Devaney and Osborne dynastyBob Devaney era (1962‚Äì72)= Bob Devaney New athletic director Tippy Dye did not renew Jennings' contract in 1962, and attempted to hire Michigan State head coach Duffy Daugherty. Daugherty instead suggested former assistant Bob Devaney, and after a lengthy contract dispute with Wyoming, Nebraska hired Devaney (1962‚Äì72, 101‚Äì20‚Äì2). Nebraska beat Miami for its first bowl win in 1962, the first of 40 consecutive winning seasons for the Cornhuskers. NU's November 3 loss to Missouri marked the beginning of Memorial Stadium's lengthy sellout streak. In his second season, Devaney ended Nebraska's 32-year conference title drought and won the school's first Orange Bowl. Despite similar success over the following years, including a loss in the 1966 Orange Bowl that would have won Nebraska the national championship, a pair of 6‚Äì4 seasons in 1967 and 1968 caused some to call for change within the program. Devaney responded by promoting 31-year-old assistant Tom Osborne to offensive coordinator. Osborne's later teams would become famous for their prolific use of the run- heavy I-form option, but his first offenses relied on a balanced attack out of the I formation; Dave Humm's 2,259 passing yards in 1972 were a program record until 2004. Bob Devaney and quarterback Frank Patrick in 1967 Nebraska started the 1969 season 2‚Äì2, but did not suffer another loss until 1972. The program won its first national title in 1970, when bowl losses by Texas and Ohio State vaulted the Huskers to the top of the AP Poll. NU again won the national title in 1971, becoming the first and only champion to beat the teams that finished No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 in the AP Poll. This included a 35‚Äì31 Thanksgiving Day defeat of No. 2 Oklahoma that caused Dan Jenkins of Sports Illustrated to suggest \\"it was the greatest collegiate football battle ever\\". It was Nebraska's only game decided by fewer than 24 points, including a 38‚Äì6 win over Alabama the Orange Bowl. Devaney planned to retire following the season, but was convinced to return for 1972 in the hopes of winning an unprecedented third consecutive national title. Wingback Johnny Rodgers won the school's first Heisman Trophy and Nebraska beat Notre Dame to win the Orange Bowl for the third straight year, but a pair of losses effectively ended NU's title hope. Devaney retired after the season and became Nebraska's athletic director, a position he would fill until 1993, and Osborne became head coach. Devaney ended his coaching career with eight Big Eight championships and an 136‚Äì30‚Äì7 overall record, good for the 11th-highest winning percentage in major college football history. His program produced 18 All-Americans in his 11 years, including Rodgers, 1971 Outland Trophy winner Larry Jacobson, and 1972 Outland and Lombardi Award winner Rich Glover. The Bob Devaney Sports Center, completed in 1976, was named in his honor, and he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1982. The school added a statue of Devaney outside the remodeled East Stadium at Memorial Stadium in 2013. In 1997, Devaney died of a heart attack at age 82. =Tom Osborne era (1973‚Äì97)= Tom Osborne in 1965 Tom Osborne (1973‚Äì97, 255‚Äì49‚Äì3) took over for Devaney in 1973. Over the next 25 years, Osborne never lost more than three games in a season, secured 13 conference titles, and only coached three games where the Cornhuskers were not in the AP Poll top 25. The first decade of Osborne's tenure was consistent, if not spectacular. NU lost either two or three games and finished ranked between seventh and twelfth every year from 1973 to 1981. After a disappointing 1976 season in which Nebraska started No. 1 but finished the regular season just 8‚Äì3‚Äì1, it was rumored Osborne may lose his job if he lost the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl. However, these rumors were never confirmed, and Nebraska defeated Texas Tech 27‚Äì24. Two years later, Osborne beat rival Oklahoma for the first time, but Nebraska lost a rematch to the Sooners in the 1979 Orange Bowl after an upset loss to Missouri cost NU a chance at the national title. Following the season, Osborne interviewed for Colorado's head coaching position, but ultimately declined the offer. 1982 was Osborne's tenth season as head coach, and the first in which Nebraska lost just a single game. The Cornhuskers' only loss of the season came at Penn State in week 3. On Penn State's game-winning drive, wide receiver Mike McCloskey was ruled in-bounds to convert a fourth down, despite replay clearly showing he was out-of-bounds; with no replay review to overturn the call, Penn State won the game and went on to claim the national title. Nebraska started the following season ranked No. 1, and won a rematch with Penn State 44‚Äì6 in the first Kickoff Classic. The Cornhuskers finished the regular season undefeated and set a Division I record for points in a season. The offense ‚Äì led by option quarterback Turner Gill, Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier, and future No. 1 NFL Draft pick Irving Fryar ‚Äì was termed \\"The Scoring Explosion\\". In the Orange Bowl, Nebraska immediately fell behind Miami, trailing 17‚Äì0 at the end of the first quarter. Early in the second quarter, Osborne called for the fumblerooski, a trick play which had Gill \\"fumble\\" the snap by intentionally setting the ball on the ground, where it was picked up by All-American guard Dean Steinkuhler, who ran 19 yards for a touchdown. Nebraska mounted a furious comeback, scoring a touchdown to get within one point with just seconds remaining. However, Osborne elected to go for two and the win outright, despite a tie likely winning the national title for Nebraska, and the conversion pass fell incomplete. Tommie Frazier in 1993 Nebraska ended the 1980s with more wins than any other program, but failed to win a national championship from a major selector (though NU has five unclaimed titles from the decade). Barry Switzer's departure from Oklahoma in 1988 left the program mired in sanctions and gave Nebraska a clearer path to conference success, but did not help the Cornhuskers on the national stage; from 1987 to 1993, NU lost seven straight bowl games to ACC opponents. The last of these was the controversial 1993 national championship game, in which a blown call at the goal line and a missed field goal cost Nebraska the title. Osborne was so upset by this loss that he had the scoreboard at Memorial Stadium display the 18‚Äì16 final score for the entire offseason. Nebraska's 1993 team was led by star quarterback Tommie Frazier. Frazier was the biggest recruit in Osborne's 1992 class, which has since been listed among the greatest recruiting classes in college football history. Frazier, a Florida native, also represented a philosophical shift in recruiting for Osborne, who had historically been successful largely with Midwestern players and an unusually high number of walk-ons. In the middle of the 1994 season, however, a leg injury to Frazier meant pro-style backup Brook Berringer had to step in and run Osborne's option-based offense; Berringer's kind demeanor and heroics over the rest of the regular season endeared him to fans. While Frazier returned to start the national championship game, Berringer replaced him in the second quarter, and behind two Cory Schlesinger touchdowns, NU won Osborne his first outright national title as a head coach. Statue of Tom Osborne and Brook Berringer outside the Osborne Athletic Complex at Memorial Stadium Nebraska's 1995 team is often listed as the greatest in college football history. Behind Frazier, who finished second in Heisman Trophy voting, and I-back Lawrence Phillips, the Cornhuskers won every game by at least 14 points and set a college football record by scoring 53.2 points per game. Nebraska beat four teams that finished in the top ten, and NU's 62‚Äì24 Fiesta Bowl victory over Florida and head coach Steve Spurrier is still the biggest national championship blowout ever. Osborne's title teams in 1994 and 1995 join Devaney's 1970 and 1971 teams as the only undefeated back-to-back national champions since 1956. Berringer was killed in a plane crash two days before the 1996 NFL Draft, where he was projected to be a mid-round selection. Over 4,000 people attended his funeral service, and in 2006 a statue of Osborne and Berringer was erected at Memorial Stadium. In 1996, the Big Eight merged with the Southwest to create the Big 12 Conference. Despite its similarity in name, the Big 12 was an entirely new conference and did not retain any of the Big Eight's history or records. After a shutout loss at Arizona State in week 2, Nebraska won ten straight games to make the first Big 12 Championship Game. However, the Cornhuskers missed out on a fourth straight national championship appearance when they were upset by Texas. Nebraska started the 1997 season outside the top five, but a win at second-ranked Washington quickly vaulted the Cornhuskers up to No. 1. A 45‚Äì38 overtime victory at Missouri in week nine kept the Huskers' title hopes alive, though it dropped NU to No. 3 in both polls. The comeback win was highlighted by the Flea Kicker, a last-second, game-tying touchdown that bounced off the foot of intended receiver Shevin Wiggins and directly into the hands of Matt Davison. Nebraska returned to the conference championship game and beat Texas A&M; 54‚Äì15 for its first Big 12 title. Nebraska entered bowl season trailing Michigan in both polls, but a 42‚Äì17 victory over Peyton Manning and Tennessee in the Orange Bowl narrowly boosted NU to the top of the Coaches Poll. On December 10, 1997, Osborne announced he would retire following the Orange Bowl, and longtime assistant Frank Solich would take over. NU's subsequent victory made him the only coach to retire following a national championship. Nebraska posted a 60‚Äì3 record in the final five years of Osborne's tenure. His career record of 255‚Äì49‚Äì3 gives him the fourth-highest winning percentage in major college football history. Osborne was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999, and has been recognized as one of the greatest coaches in college football history. After his retirement from coaching, Osborne was elected to Congress and represented Nebraska's third district from 2001 to 2007. He returned to the University of Nebraska as athletic director in 2007, and retired in 2013. The university finished construction on the Tom and Nancy Osborne Athletic Complex in 2006, and dedicated the field at Memorial Stadium in his honor. The post-Osborne eraProgram in transition (1998‚Äì2010)= Bo Pelini in 2008 Upon Osborne's retirement, the program was handed over to running backs coach Frank Solich (1998‚Äì2003, 58‚Äì18), who had played at Nebraska under Devaney. In his six seasons, Solich won the 1999 Big 12 title and took the Cornhuskers to the 2001 national championship game, a season in which quarterback Eric Crouch won the Heisman Trophy. After going 7‚Äì7 season in 2002, the first non-winning season for Nebraska in 40 years, Solich made aggressive changes to his coaching staff. The approach appeared successful, as the Cornhuskers improved to 9‚Äì3 in 2003, but second-year athletic director Steve Pederson fired Solich after the season, justifying the move with the now-infamous claim that he would not \\"let Nebraska gravitate into mediocrity\\" or \\"surrender the Big 12 to Oklahoma and Texas\\". First-year defensive coordinator Bo Pelini was appointed interim head coach and led the Cornhuskers to a 17‚Äì3 win over Michigan State in the Alamo Bowl. Solich was so upset with his alma mater and longtime employer that he did not return to Lincoln for over 15 years. Although Pelini interviewed for the position as permanent replacement, former Oakland Raiders coach Bill Callahan (2004‚Äì07, 27‚Äì22) was named Solich's successor following a 40-day, one-man coaching search conducted by Pederson. Callahan's mandate to prevent Nebraska's decline was not immediately successful, as his NFL-style West Coast offense was criticized harshly by fans for its departure from Osborne's run-dominant option. Criticism did not die down when Nebraska went 5‚Äì6 in Callahan's first year, NU's first losing season since 1961. Following moderate success in 2005 and 2006, Nebraska lost five consecutive games for the first time since 1958 in 2007, including a record-setting 76‚Äì39 loss to Kansas. Pederson was fired as athletic director in the middle of the five-game slide, and Osborne returned from his political career to fill in as interim athletic director. Callahan later met the same fate as Pederson, as he was fired by Osborne immediately after a season-ending 65‚Äì51 loss to Colorado. Osborne, now full-time athletic director, hired Pelini (2008‚Äì14, 67‚Äì27) to return to Nebraska as the program's 32nd head coach. Pelini's first team tied for the Big 12 North division title with a 9‚Äì4 record, the best record among all 28 first-yearcoaches in FBS. In 2009, Heisman finalist Ndamukong Suh helped Nebraska lead the country in scoring defense at 10.4 points per game, just two years after ranking among the nation's worst. NU finished 10‚Äì4 and Pelini was given a raise and contract extension. Following the 2010‚Äì11 academic year, the University of Nebraska announced it was ending its association with the Big 12 and joining the Big Ten Conference. =Move to the Big Ten (2011‚Äìpresent)= Scott Frost Pelini's four seasons coaching in the new conference resulted in only one conference title game appearance, a 70‚Äì31 loss to unranked Wisconsin in 2012. In 2014, following another season in which Nebraska performed poorly against high- quality opposition, athletic director Shawn Eichorst fired Pelini. At the time of the firing, the university still owed Pelini $7.65 million. Pelini left the program with a 67‚Äì27 record, winning either nine or ten games each season; ironically, NU lost three games under Pelini in his final season, the only time he did not lose exactly four games. Shortly after, Eichorst hired Oregon State's Mike Riley to lead the program, a move that was harshly criticized given Riley's recent lack of success and mediocre track record. The Cornhuskers ended 2014 under interim coach Barney Cotton, losing to USC in the Holiday Bowl and finishing 9‚Äì4, Nebraska's seventh consecutive four-loss season. In 2016, Riley (2015‚Äì17, 19‚Äì19) took Nebraska into the national top five for the first time since 2010, but a 4‚Äì8 2017 season was the program's worst in 56 years. Following a home loss to Northern Illinois, University of Nebraska chancellor Ronnie D. Green fired Eichorst and appointed former Husker Dave Rimington interim athletic director. Bill Moos was hired as Eichorst's replacement in October and terminated Riley the day after the season ended.[Mike Riley relieved of head football coaching duties http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID;=211687156] On December 2, 2017, Moos hired alumnus Scott Frost from UCF, after Frost led the Knights to a 13‚Äì0 2017 season. Frost began his Nebraska head coaching career at just 9‚Äì15 through two seasons. In 2019, Nebraska announced construction of a 350,000-square foot, $155 million athletic complex adjacent to Memorial Stadium's northeast corner. The following March, in the midst of a nationwide push to allow further student-athlete compensation, NU partnered with opendorse to \\"help student-athletes build their individual brands\\", the first university to do so.

Recipients may include those who cannot afford bail on their own or those who are in jail due to being arrested while protesting. Community bail funds determine their own criteria for eligibility and amount of bail that they will support. As of 2020, there are over 60 community bail funds around the United States represented in the National Bail Fund Network. Bail funds are related to bail reform efforts, as by paying individual bails, funds help directly address the disparities in case outcomes faced by those in pre-trial detention who are unable to post bail. Being unable to pay bail, and thus staying in jail longer before trial, means that defendants who cannot afford bail may have issues with managing or keeping employment, childcare, housing, or mounting an effective defense in their case, leading to poorer case outcomes. The Vera Institute of Justice found that in 2013 in New York, 54% of inmates who remained in jail until their cases were disposed could not afford their bail of $2500 or less. In 2020, the Prison Policy Initiative found that over half a million people were in jail or prison on pre-trial detention in the United States at any given time, many because they could not afford bail. Operation Though community bail funds vary in how they raise money, decide on applicant eligibility, and manage the logistics of posting bail, the basic principles are the same. Monetary bail is set after arrest as a guarantee to ensure that suspects return to court for trial. Bail is paid to the court as a deposit that is returned at the conclusion of a case. This means that bail funds that post bail receive the money back (minus fees) when the individual bailed out returns to court and completes their case, enabling the bail fund to reuse the money for another bail. Bail funds are differentiated from other methods of paying bail in that they are often unconnected to the individuals who receive bail. Simonson, J. (2017). Bail nullification. Michigan Law Review, 115(5), p.599 History The history of bail funds dates back to the 1920s; the American Civil Liberties Union set up a bail fund in 1920 to release people arrested for sedition during the First Red Scare. However, the rise of community bail funds across the United States has only happened since around 2012. In 2012, New York passed the only law related to bail funds in the United States when it legalized charitable bail funds that posted bails of $2000 or less, which led to the revival of The Bronx Freedom Fund and the creation of the Brooklyn Bail Fund.

Weston took attention in particular to cabbages and would photograph several arrangements of this vegetable, from 1929 to 1936. The present Cabbage Leaf is probably the most known of this series. It depicts a flayed leaf of cabbage on display, in a monumental close-up, lying in a dark background, while highlighting his spinal structure and linear striations, like if it was a sculpture in relief.

By July 2020, many of the protests, which have been held virtually every day since May 28, have drawn more than 1,000 participants. Protests continued into August and September 2020, often drawing hundreds. The majority of the protests in Portland have been peaceful, but many demonstrations have involved rioting, heated confrontations with police and counter-protestors, sometimes involving injury, and use of tear gas and other weapons. There have been numerous instances of arson, looting, vandalism, and injuries during nighttime protests. One person was shot and killed in the aftermath of a clash between protesters and counter-protesters. In early July, the federal government deployed law enforcement officers to Portland for the stated purpose of protecting federal property amid the unrest. The deployment was criticized for not clearly identifying officers and for seizing protesters not on or near federal property, including by Portland's mayor and most of the state's congressional delegation. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection service defended the practice on the grounds of protecting the officers' personal safety. Several lawsuits were filed by and on behalf of journalists and legal observers against local and federal law enforcement, and by the state against several federal agencies. Background The protests were initially precipitated by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by police in Minneapolis. The New York Times reported that demonstrators in Portland, including some who identify as Antifa, the loose coalition of self-described anti-fascist activists, have had years of conflict with law enforcement. Other recent police killings of people of color, including Breonna Taylor, Elijah McClain, and Jacob Blake have contributed to the national and local unrest driving the protests. Protesters have also drawn attention a number of Black people killed by local police. The Oregonian identified the 2003 shooting of Kendra James as an inflection point that galvanized the Black community and inspired a movement to fundamentally reimagine law enforcement. The Oregonian reported that the 39 people killed by Portland police between 2003 and 2020 were disproportionately Black. Among those killed since 2003 are Aaron Campbell, Quanice Hayes, and Patrick Kimmons.https://www.opb.org/news/article/patrick-kimmons-officers-cleared- portland-grand-jury/ Organizers A number of different organizations have led demonstrations, including Rose City Justice and the Albina Ministerial Alliance. The Facebook and Twitter accounts associated with the Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front (or PNW Youth Liberation Front) have served as \\"information hubs\\" for sharing protest plans. The group does not have identifiable leaders and describes itself as a \\"decentralized network of autonomous youth collectives dedicated to direct action towards total liberation\\". The groups' Facebook and Twitter accounts were created in February 2017, and have 6,100 and 28,700 followers, respectively, as of late July 2020. The group has used a black flag emoji, which often symbolizes anarchism. DemonstrationsMay= Boarded windows in downtown Portland on May 31, 2020, following a series of demonstrations Hundreds of demonstrators gathered on May 28, at one point blocking the entrance to the Multnomah County Justice Center. There were two peaceful demonstrations held on May 29. A \\"Eulogy for Black America\\" was organized by the Portland chapter of NAACP at Terry Schrunk Plaza in downtown Portland, and a vigil was organized by the PNW Youth Liberation Front at Peninsula Park, in the Piedmont neighborhood of north Portland. Crowd estimates for the demonstration at Terry Schrunk Plaza ranged from a \\"hundred or so\\" to \\"hundreds\\" of people; the event included several speakers including Portland City Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty. She was reportedly \\"visibly overcome by emotion\\" and said, \\"This is the reality of being black in America. Over and over and over again, black people have been killed, and there has been silence from the majority community....Black people are tired. Black people are exhausted by racism.\\" The president of the Portland NAACP chapter, Reverend E. D. Mondain√©, also spoke. Boarded windows at a alt= More than 1,000 people gathered at Peninsula Park, where ministers and Black Panthers spoke against police brutality. From the crowd, hundreds marched to downtown Portland via Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. and the Burnside Bridge. Along the way, some people started breaking windows, tagging buildings with graffiti, looting, and setting vehicles and buildings on fire. A riot ensued, prompting Mayor Ted Wheeler to declare a state of emergency. A fire was started inside the Multnomah County Justice Center. Pioneer Place and other storefronts saw looting. The riot lasted for approximately 5 hours; two officers were injured, and 13 people were arrested. The Portland Business Alliance estimated the riot cost local businesses \\"tens of millions\\" of dollars because of property damage, looting, and lost wages. On May 30, Rev. Mondain√© posted a video online urging protesters to stay home and calling looting and violence counterproductive. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Portland again; crowd estimates ranged from hundreds to a thousand. One group attempted to break into the Lloyd Center; riot police broke up a group of approximately 200 people outside the shopping mall. Police said that a fire was set inside the Portland Law and Justice Center during the protests. Police declared that they had arrested 16 people by 11 p.m. At least 51 demonstrators were arrested during the night, bringing the total number of arrests to date to 64. On the afternoon of May 31, a crowd assembled at the intersection of Southwest 3rd Avenue and Main Street in downtown. At one point, in a show of solidarity with Black Lives Matter, some police officers took a knee alongside protesters. By nightfall there were approximately 6,000 peaceful demonstrators. Shortly after the curfew took effect at 8 p.m., police dispersed the crowd outside the Multnomah County Justice Center using tear gas. Separately, an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 people gathered at Laurelhurst Park in southeast Portland, and others assembled outside a former police precinct at the intersection of East Burnside Street and 47th Avenue. Police did not intervene as the group marched from the Multnomah County Justice Center to Pioneer Courthouse Square and back. The Pearl District Neighborhood Association was \\"advised of potential protest activity\\" in the Pearl District and the Northwest District. Around 11:30 p.m., saying projectiles were thrown at officers, police declared \\"a civil disturbance and unlawful assembly\\" and ordered protesters to leave. =June= Protesters on the Burnside Bridge on June 1, 2020 On June 1, three demonstrations were organized in Portland. One was held at the intersection of Northeast Sandy and 57th. Others were planned in downtown and at the intersection of Southeast Stark Street and 13th Avenue. More than 1,000 protesters staged a die-in on the Burnside Bridge, then continued to downtown's Pioneer Courthouse Square. Following two hours of speeches, chants, and music, demonstrators returned to the city's east side via the same bridge. Portland Police allowed use of the bridge, and the evening's events remained mostly peaceful. A drone photograph of the die-in by photographer Andrew Wallner earned more than a million reactions on social media posts. On the fifth day of protests, hundreds gathered at Pioneer Courthouse Square then staged another die-in on the Burnside Bridge. A second demonstration was organized at Revolution Hall. By the evening, thousands had gathered at Pioneer Courthouse Square. One group returned to the Burnside Bridge, while hundreds remained in the square. Around 8 p.m., the two groups merged and numbered approximately 10,000. The demonstrations were mostly peaceful until later in the evening; most protesters marched across the Burnside Bridge, but police used stun grenades and tear gas on a smaller, separate group of people who were throwing projectiles. Police arrested several people, and 16 were detained. Elsewhere in the metropolitan area, there were demonstrations in Cedar Mill and at Tualatin's Lake at the Commons. The first few days of June were identified, as of July 8, as having the largest crowds of the Portland George Floyd protests, exceeding 10,000 people. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) declared a riot at one of the protests in early June. Arson, looting, and vandalism, and injuries to two officers were reported since the demonstrations began on May 28. Approximately 100 people had been arrested . Protesters at Tom McCall Waterfront Park on June 3, 2020 Several thousand people demonstrated on June 3, gathering at Tom McCall Waterfront Park, where Rev. Mondain√© and others spoke. Later, groups splintered, with many gathering outside the Multnomah County Justice Center once again. There were other small protests throughout the city, including one in north Portland's Columbia Park and another at Pioneer Courthouse Square. The Oregonian reported an overall crowd size of approximately 8,000. Thousands demonstrated on June 4. The protests were peaceful until late at night, and twelve arrests were made. Damian Lillard helped lead thousands across the Morrison Bridge into downtown, where protests gathered at Waterfront Park. There were multiple demonstrations planned on June 5. Don't Shoot Portland organized the \\"George Floyd Memorial and Benefit Show\\" at Laurelwood Park. In the Woodstock neighborhood, the family-friendly \\"Black Lives Matter March & Rally\\" saw up to 2,000 people march from the All Saints Episcopal along Southeast Woodstock to 52nd, and no incidents requiring police intervention. Demonstrators also gathered at Revolution Hall for the \\"No Justice No Peace Rally & March\\". Portland Trail Blazers players Rodney Hood, Nassir Little, and Anfernee Simons all joined. In the evening, protesters pushed down fencing in front of the Multnomah County Justice Center and police used gas and stun grenades for crowd dispersal. BLM march at NE 15th Ave. between Broadway & Fremont on June 7, 2020 On June 7 in Portland, outside the city's Justice Center, 48 people were jailed in protest. The protest and march originated at Pioneer Courthouse Square. Demonstrators gathered at Southeast Stark Street and 12th Avenue on June 9. There were approximately 500 people outside the Multnomah County Justice Center by 9 p.m. alt= On June 10, an afternoon rally to disband the Portland Police was held in Terry Schrunk Plaza. In the evening a ride leaving Irving Park was organized by Portland's chapter of Black Girls Do Bike. Several thousand people marched from Southeast Stark Street and 12th Avenue to Unthank Park. Protesters failed to create an autonomous zone similar to Seattle's Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Approximately 1,000 people demonstrated on June 11 after an already-planned city budget meeting led to historic levels of public comment, with one city commissioner, Chloe Eudaly, voting \\"no,\\" stating that the proposed cuts to the police bureau fell short of what demonstrators were calling for. A unanimous vote was required to pass the budget. \\"While my colleague can take a principled 'no' stance on passing this budget, I as a Black woman cannot,\\" Commissioner Hardesty responded in a statement. \\"I do not want to let this detract from the very real steps taken, but it is an important reminder on what performative allyship looks like.\\" Cleveland High School on June 13, 2020alt= For the 17th day, protesters assembled in various parts of the Portland area on June 13. The main march, with at least 1,000 people, went from Revolution Hall, the starting point for most of the marches, and went to Cleveland High School, including a stretch of Southeast Division St. from 11th to 26th. The Clinton Street Theater displayed a quote from Malcolm X on its marquee as protesters marched past. N1789M, a Cessna 208 Caravan surveillance plane linked with the U.S. Marshals Service circled overhead for 3 hours. About 1,000 demonstrators marched to Jefferson High School on June 14, the 18th day of protests. At a second city budget vote on the issue, commissioners voted 3‚Äì1 to cut PPB funding by $15 million. This would terminate the Gun Violence Reduction Team and cut funding for school resource officers and transit police, while reallocating nearly $5 million to Portland Street Response, which would respond to calls concerning homeless people instead of police. Commissioner Chloe Eudaly again voted \\"no\\". The group Care Not Cops, who wanted more money cut from PPB funding, later that day demonstrated outside of Wheeler's apartment in Northwest Portland. By midnight, they had been joined by hundreds of people, who began blocking off the streets at Northwest Glisan and 10th Avenue with impromptu. Just after 5:30 a.m. police cleared the scene; a police spokesman said there were only about 50 protesters left by that time. Wheeler helped in cleaning up the debris. June 23 was the sentencing date for Jeremy Christian, who was convicted of murder and attempted murder for an attack in 2017. Three men, all of them white, attempted to stop Christian's attack on two black girls; Christian killed two of them and injured the third. In commemoration of that event, hundreds gathered at Powell Park on SE 26th and Powell for a demonstration and march focusing on white allies. They marched to Reed College, which one of the men killed had attended. County officials removed a fence that had stood around the Justice Center for several weeks on June 26. =July= Officers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) were deployed following President Trump's executive order that sought to protect statues. Willamette Week reported that several federal law enforcement agencies were deployed to Portland on July 2, including the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Protective Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Homeland Security Investigations. DHS sent officers in tactical gear from \\"more than a half-dozen\\" federal agencies and departments from around the country. Portland Deputy Police Chief Chris Davis said his department had not requested federal assistance and that federal officers' presence would \\"complicate things\\" for the PPB. Maywood Park on July 4, 2020alt= Multiple demonstrations took place in the city on July 4 including an \\"Anti- Independence Day\\" rally that began at Portland State University's Native American Student & Community Center, expressing indigenous support for Black Americans, followed by the \\"Bars Up Guns Down\\" motorcycle ride from Revolution Hall to the Justice Center and back in support of Black Lives Matter. That night, several hundred people gathered at Chapman Square and let off illegal aerial fireworks, some of which were aimed directly at the Justice Center, actions that were condemned by the PPB and the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office. Police twice declared a riot on the national holiday, first at 4 am and again after 11 pm. Protests continued on July 5 for the 39th consecutive day. Seven people faced federal charges for their activities at the Justice Center demonstrations over the July 4 weekend. On July 9 about 50 people marched in Lents Park and about 100 gathered downtown by the Justice Center. In the same neighborhood, a young Black woman, 18-year-old Shai-India Harris, was fatally shot, and the police did not immediately identify any suspects. A man from Texas was arrested for striking a Portland police officer three times with a hammer on July 10. On July 11, protester Donavan La Bella was shot in the head with a \\"less lethal\\" round by federal police, suffering facial and skull fractures and having to undergo facial reconstruction surgery. On July 14, a group marched from Kenton Park to the Portland Police Association building on Lombard street, where the crowd grew to more than 200 people. After demonstrators faced off with police officers, the police declared a riot. Graffiti outside Edith Green ‚Äì Wendell Wyatt Federal Building, July 19, 2020 During the protests, tactical officers from the U.S. Marshals Special Operations Group and U.S. Customs and Border Protection's elite BORTAC unit were sent to Portland to protect federal property. Starting on or about July 14, however, federal agents in unmarked vehicles began arresting protesters who were not near federal property. Rose City Justice led a march of 200‚Äì250 people from Revolution Hall to Pioneer Courthouse Square on July 14, after having previously suspended its activities. On July 14, Wheeler called on Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf to remove federal agents from the city, accusing them of causing violence and using \\"life-threatening tactics\\" and saying \\"we do not need or want their help\\". The following day, four of Oregon's U.S. lawmakers issued a statement condemning the recent actions of federal law enforcement officials in Portland, who used tear gas and other aggressive techniques multiple times since July 10. U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley and U.S. Representatives Suzanne Bonamici and Earl Blumenauer accused the federal government of a \\"politically driven\\" response and of seeking \\"to target, attack, or silence those peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights\\". , federal officers had arrested at least 19 people. Portland police closed the Plaza Blocks, a hub for protesters at the Justice Center, at 5:00a.m. on July 16. Starting the early morning of July 15, \\"rapid deployment teams\\" of federal agents from multiple agencies arrested protesters and forcefully took them in unmarked vans. Protesters accused the officers of being unidentified, but Customs and Border Protection later countered accusations by stating that officers were wearing CBP insignias. A story focusing on the search, detention, questioning, and brief incarceration of Mark Pettibone, a 29 year old protester, was first reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting and picked up the next day by national outlets, including a New York Times story authored by independent Portland journalist Sergio Olmos. Several witnesses reported seeing federal law enforcement officers in camouflage \\"emerge from unmarked vehicles, grab protesters without explanation, and drive off.\\" Pettibone stated that he was \\"basically tossed\\" into an unmarked van and transported to a holding cell in the federal courthouse and later released without being charged. Similar incidents involving plainclothes officers of unknown agencies, occurred the following day. The failure of officers to identify what agency they report to is a tactic that drew comparisons to actions in preparation for the Donald Trump photo op at St. John's Church in Washington, D.C. several weeks prior. The actions by federal agents have been condemned by the mayor, governor, members of Congress, and independent commentators. These arrests were reported as having rejuvenated the protests in Portland, prompting crowds in the hundreds for the first time in several weeks, and drawing criticism from Wheeler, who is also the police commissioner and has been widely considered to condone use of force by local police. On July 18, according to police, protesters gathered at the PPB's North Precinct, taunting officers and vandalizing patrol vehicles; police also said that protesters broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A police statement stated that officers extinguished the fire and declared a riot, making seven arrests and deploying tear gas but not CS gas. Protesters made barricades out of fencing they removed from around the federal courthouse. Conflict resumed on the night of July 19. Hundreds of protesters, including what Portland police described as \\"dozens of people with shields, helmets, gas masks, umbrellas, bats, and hockey sticks,\\" repeatedly advanced on the U.S. courthouse. At about 1:30a.m. the following morning, protesters set a fire in the portico. Federal agents emerged from inside and deployed tear gas to repel the protesters. The Portland Police Department stated that although federal officers used tear gas, the city's officers were not involved in crowd control measures and did not fire tear gas. At night on July 18, Navy veteran Chris David, wearing his Naval Academy gear, approached some of the federal agents to tell them \\"That oath of office is essentially swearing loyalty to the Constitution of the United States, and what they're doing is not constitutional anymore.\\" As seen on video, David was standing still when one agent hit him forcefully five times with a baton; another agent sprayed David's face with what David said was pepper spray. As a result of the incident, David's hand was broken in two places.Jennifer Selva and Hollie Silverman, \\"A Navy veteran says he was beaten and pepper sprayed by authorities while attending his first protest in Portland\\", CNN.com (last accessed July 20, 2020) He required reconstructive surgery with pins and plates on his shattered ring finger and a bone in his hand was also broken. The officers were later identified as U.S. Marshals, and the Department of Justice inspector general was said to be investigating. On that night for the first time Portland mothers formed a human shield ‚Äì a \\"Wall of Moms\\" ‚Äì to protect protesters from federal agents outside the federal courthouse. Federal agents in military-style gear fired tear gas canisters into the group of mothers.‚ÄòWall Of Moms‚Äô Organizer In Portland Speaks Out After Teargassing By Federal Agents, MSNBC Around 1:45 a.m., when another group of unidentified armed federal agents advanced on a group of protesters, a woman wearing only a face mask and a stocking cap, later dubbed \\"Naked Athena\\" by reporters, confronted them. Despite the deployment of pepper balls and tear gas, she posed for the agents for about 15 minutes before they withdrew. Photographs of her action went viral.Richard Read, \\"Out of Portland tear gas, an apparition emerges, capturing the imagination of protesters\\", Los Angeles Times, (last accessed July 20, 2020) On July 20, during the ninth week of daily protests, the \\"Wall of Moms\\" sang \\"Hands Up Please Don't Shoot Me\\" in a lullaby fashion while in Chapman Square. A \\"Wall of Dads\\" joined in and used leaf blowers to clear away tear gas and a \\"Wall of Vets\\" also joined in the demonstration for the first time. President Trump denounced the Wall of Moms as a \\"scam\\", tweeting: \\"The 'protesters' are actually anarchists who hate our Country. The line of innocent \\"mothers\\" were a scam that Lamestream refuses to acknowledge, just like they don't report the violence of these demonstrations!\\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1287517470497083393 On July 22, mayor Wheeler attempted to address a crowd of protesters but was faced with boos and calls to resign. A riot was declared later in the night after police reported multiple flares and other incendiaries were thrown over the fence surrounding the federal courthouse, resulting in fires. Wheeler was teargassed along with protesters when federal agents deployed the munition into the crowd. Some protesters, noting the city's use of tear gas in response to protests earlier in summer 2020, reportedly \\"mocked\\" the mayor following his exposure. On July 24, federal prosecutors unveiled charges against 18 protesters, five of whom were charged with suspicion of assaulting a federal officer, trespassing and creating a disturbance during protests on the night of July 20‚Äì21, eight were charged in connection with criminal conduct during the July 21‚Äì22 night protest-including one person charged with arson-and six were charged over events from the night of July 22‚Äì23, according to U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy Williams. According to the Justice Department, all had made an initial appearance in federal court and were released pending trial or other proceedings. The same day, thousands of protesters began gathering in front of the federal courthouse's perimeter fence in the evening, with the crowd peaking at around 4,000 according to authorities. Many protesters danced and chanted \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and \\"Feds go home\\" to the sound of drums. At 10:15 p.m., a man tried to climb the fence and was quickly arrested. As the night went on, protesters shook the fence surrounding the courthouse and individuals in the crowd pointed green lasers at federal agents and threw flares, fireworks, glass bottles, and other solid objects at the building, prompting federal agents to respond with pepper balls, tear gas, and flash bangs on more than one occasion. According to DHS and Associated Press, power tools such as an angle grinder were also used to damage property, particularly the fence. Inside the courthouse, agents had most lights turned off reportedly to protect from people in the crowd who were firing metal ball bearings through the windows with sling shots. That same night, U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman denied a restraining order by the state attorney general to restrict the actions of federal police. At around 2:30 a.m. on the morning of July 25, the Federal Protective Service declared the protest an unlawful assembly and began dispersing the crowd down Third Street with tear gas, pepper balls, and mass force. People scattered and small groups roamed the downtown as tear gas choked the air. According to authorities, six federal officers were injured during the overnight protest, with one suffering a concussion and another taken to the hospital for burns. One person was arrested for failing to comply with orders but was later released with no charges, bringing the total number of people arrested on or near the courthouse since early July to 60. In several cases, people who'd been arrested had their release from jail conditioned on signing a document stating a variant of \\"Defendant may not attend any other protests, rallies, assemblies or public gathering in the state of Oregon\\" while the person's case is pending; more than one constitutional lawyer has stated that conditioning release on such agreement is a violation of the freedom of assembly clause of the First Amendment. On July 25, a man was stabbed in downtown Portland. The suspect was taken into custody on the same day. According to The Oregonian, the victim was a vocal Black supporter of Trump who was videographing the protests and had been trailed by a group of people. On July 28 someone threw an incendiary device into the portico of the federal courthouse; it caused a fire near the entrance, according to federal prosecutors. On July 31 an 18-year-old protester was arrested and charged with throwing the device. Under a deal worked out between Governor Kate Brown and the Trump administration, federal agents withdrew to standby locations on July 30, while state and local law enforcement forces took over responsibility for protecting the courthouse; they made no arrests and mostly stayed out of sight. Protests that night were largely peaceful. A DHS spokesperson said federal officers would remain in the area at least until August 3. Protests on the night of July 31-the 64th night of protests-were largely peaceful and no arrests were made. However, video emerged apparently showing a group of Portland protesters using an American flag and a Bible to kindle a bonfire outside the federal courthouse shortly after midnight; according to KOIN 6, the fire was subsequently put out by members of Moms United for Black Lives Matter. Protesters started another bonfire using plywood shortly after, but the crowd dwindled to around 100 at 2:00 a.m. before largely dispersing by 2:30 a.m. The Bible burning video went viral and sparked condemnation online, including from the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. =August= A \\"Feds Go Home\\" sign in August 2020 Despite a brief reprieve following the pullback of federal agents in late July-early August, tensions between protesters and police-including Portland police, local sheriff's deputies, and Oregon State Police troopers-continued to manifest, though demonstrations were noticeably smaller. On August 5, violent clashes occurred in a residential neighborhood at a police precinct station. Tear gas was used. Captain Tony Passadore, the incident commander, sought to distance the violent rally from the greater George Floyd protests, saying \\"I don't want people to get confused to think that this was something related to Black Lives Matter ... I've been the incident commander for 24 nights of the 70-plus events, and I've seen amazing protesting going on in the city of Portland where people gather together.\\" On August 6, Mayor Ted Wheeler denounced demonstrators clashing with police, saying \\"you are not demonstrating, you are attempting to commit murder,\\" along with predicting there would be \\"more attacks on public buildings\\". That night, police deployed smoke grenades and used mass force to disperse a crowd of about 200 protesters near the precinct station after declaring an unlawful assembly. The Pacific Northwest Youth Liberation Front advertised the rallies on August 5 and 6 with the slogan \\"No cops. No prisons. Total abolition.\\" Media images showed an elderly woman with a fire extinguisher trying to prevent protesters from starting a fire at the station, but was blocked by a black-clad protester. Officers arrested 12 adults and detained one minor. Police reportedly did not use tear gas this night. Roads near the precinct were closed later in the morning of August 7. Portland police tweeted \\"Any persons including members of the press who violate this order will be subject to arrest\\". Mayor Wheeler deplored violent protesters as political \\"props\\" for President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, saying that by partaking in violence, they were reinforcing Trump's messaging that \\"sick and dangerous anarchists\\" were fomenting chaos in Portland. On August 8, peaceful demonstrations were held in Northeast and Southeast Portland, including a rally in Peninsula Park and a march organized at Laurelhurst Park. Hundreds of people gathered at Waterfront Park to hear activist and worship pastor Sean Feucht speak at the \\"Riots to Revival\\" event, where he sought to \\"flip the script\\" on recent unrest. Around 10:00 p.m., Moms United for Black Lives Matter, the renamed \\"Wall of Moms\\", led hundreds of marchers northwest from Peninsula Park to the Portland Police Association (PPA) police union headquarters on North Lombard Street. The nighttime protest became increasingly rowdy as protesters barricaded the street with chain link fences and, according to police, \\"pushed dumpsters into the street to block traffic, set a dumpster on fire, vandalized the PPA office with spray paint, and destroyed security cameras\\". At 11:35 p.m., a small group broke into the offices and lit a fire. Police declared an unlawful assembly at 11:38 p.m. before declaring a riot minutes later, in which protesters, media and legal observers were ordered to disperse. According to police, the crowd began shining green lasers and throwing bottles and paint balloons, injuring three officers, before police bypassed the barricade and began making arrests and pushing the crowd of about 300 people back, including using smoke munitions and flash bangs, but no tear gas. \\"Officers moved the crowd so the fire could be extinguished before it could grow out of control,\\" said Portland police. At 1:19 a.m., Portland Police declared a riot at Kenton Park, declared the park closed, and urged the crowd to leave. The majority of the crowd left by 2:00 a.m., though police said arrests were made. On August 16, a man was beaten and left in the street unconscious near a Black Lives Matter protest in Portland. He had previously tried to intervene on behalf of a transgender woman who was being harassed, physically attacked, and robbed by a mob. Other people were also attacked by the mob. The man who allegedly rendered the victim unconscious with a kick to the head was identified as Marquise Love and was subsequently wanted by police. A 32-minute video shows the episode with the kick to the head occurring near the end of the video.Portland man beaten during downtown protest: What a new 32-minute video reveals Love turned himself in on August 21 and was charged with three felonies. On August 22 at around noon, right-wing and pro-law enforcement groups held a \\"Trump 2020 Cruise Rally\\" rally at the Multnomah County Justice Center that was quickly met with counter-protestors. According to The Oregonian, the right-wing groups included Proud Boys and supporters of president Donald Trump with some carrying rifles, body armor, helmets, and makeshift shields, while left-wing counter-protesters included regular BLM supporters and anti-fascist Popular Mobilization PDX and Democratic Socialists of America members. Fights and scuffles broke out between the dueling demonstrators with solid objects thrown and some protesters firing paintball guns and using baseball bats, smoke canisters, and pepper spray; one man was seen pointing a revolver at the counter-protesters. Streets were blocked and media images showed hundreds of people were involved. Portland police warned via loudspeaker that arrests could be made but, according to a press release, they refused to physically intervene or declare a riot citing a shortage of manpower following previous nightly protests-there were only 30 officers available to manage the crowd-and because the skirmishes were brief and those involved were \\"willingly\\" engaged; there were no reports of arrests during the violence. The right-wing groups largely retreated from downtown by 2:30 p.m. and an unlawful assembly was declared at 2:50 p.m.; the counter-protesters returned to Terry Schrunk Plaza, though the plaza was cleared and arrests were made after another unlawful assembly was declared by federal officials. Federal buildings had been closed that weekend due to a bomb threat. A right- wing protester broke journalist Robert Evans' had with a baton while Evans was filming. On August 24, Mayor Ted Wheeler, who also serves as Portland's police commissioner, said the decision for police to not intervene in the street violence was under review. Protesters with shields and barricades during the north precinct riot on August 23, 2020 On August 23, BLM protesters marched from a park to the north police precinct while, among other things, chanting \\"Jacob Blake\\"-the name of a black man that was shot by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin on the same day. That night, a riot was declared and police deployed tear gas after protesters shot paintball guns, threw rocks and glass bottles, pointed lasers at officers and a police support plane, and set the precinct building on fire. Numerous officers reported seeing individuals with apparent \\"press\\" identification also throwing rocks at them. On the night of August 24, a riot was declared after about 300 people marched from Arbor Lodge Park to the PPA police union building. According to police, upon arrival, protesters sprayed graffiti, cut the power, and set fires inside and outside of the building; one person climbed on the roof and unfurled a banner. Dozens of police arrived shortly after and quickly extinguished the fires before surrounding the building, deploying tear gas, and making arrests. Around 100 protesters remained in the area and threw objects and shined lasers while police removed barricades blocking the street. Police briefly departed but returned after another fire was set inside the building and an awning was set ablaze. A total of 25 people were arrested before police again departed while deploying a final round of tear gas. Police said some of those arrested had weapons, including knives, a baton, and a dagger, and that individuals with \\"press\\" insignia on their clothing had disobeyed dispersal orders and thrown rocks at officers and damaged the windshield of a police vehicle; one person was detained after failing to produce press credentials. On August 25-the three-month anniversary of George Floyd's death and the 90th consecutive day of the protests-hundreds of protesters gathered at Shemanski Park in the South Park Blocks, blocks from the Justice Center, after a change of venue to not intervene with the weekly \\"Kid-Centered March for Black Lives\\", a peaceful organized march consisting of mostly children and their parents. After 9:00 p.m., the protesters at Shemanski Park marched to city hall and held a rally. According to police, within 15 minutes of arriving, some in the crowd had sprayed graffiti and broken at least three doors and a door switch; several protesters eventually entered city hall and smashed a surveillance camera and other \\"security features\\". Police declared an unlawful assembly and forced the crowd away from the building while making arrests, prompting protesters to spend the next hour marching through downtown before reconvening at city hall. Police subsequently declared a riot and again dispersed the crowd after officers were hit with items including eggs and bottles, lasers were pointed at an officer's face, a glass bus stop shelter was shattered, city hall windows were smashed, and a man reportedly ignited an aerosol can. Citing safety concerns for security guards, police had converged on city hall by midnight and made more arrests and dispersals. A total of 23 adults were arrested and two youths were detained throughout the night, the third consecutive night that over 20 demonstrators were arrested. Charges and allegations included disorderly conduct, interfering with a peace officer, assaulting a public safety officer, trespassing, resisting arrest, burglary, and unlawful directing of light from a laser pointer. A Safariland Stinger round shot at protesters during the South Waterfront ICE protest on August 26, 2020 On the evening of August 26, in South Waterfront, a \\"couple hundred\\" people gathered at Caruthers Park and marched to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) building where it was vandalized. A New York Times correspondent said that by 10:15 p.m. federal officers, including Federal Protective Service and other DHS personnel, were standing off against protesters. Police declared an unlawful assembly around 11:00 p.m. after some in the crowd threw bottles, eggs, and rocks at federal officers, one of whom was injured. Federal officers dispersed the crowd using mass force, tear gas, and impact munitions but local Portland police did not do so, according to a press release. 11 arrests were made. On August 28, around 7:00 p.m., about a dozen protesters occupied the lobby of Mayor Ted Wheeler's Pearl District condominium, demanding he reduce the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) budget and resign as mayor and police commissioner, among other requests. Wheeler never emerged and it was unclear if he was at the residence or not. By 10:00 p.m., the group had departed the lobby but a larger demonstration of around 150 people was held in the street outside the condo, with live performances and dancing. Around 11:45 p.m., at Peninsula Park, a civil rights vigil transformed into at least 150 people marching to the boarded-up PPA police union building, in which demonstrators set two dumpsters on fire and barricaded roads. Around 12:40 a.m., police declared a riot and dispersed the crowd after the building's plywood-covered entrance was set on fire. According to police, 19 arrests were made and more than half of those arrested lived outside of Portland. Around 10:00 p.m. on August 31, Mayor Ted Wheeler's birthday, protesters marched from the North Park Blocks and gathered outside his condo to again demand his resignation. Demonstrators presented the protest as a birthday celebration, with some wearing party hats, chanting, dancing to music, and, according to police, launching \\"illegal commercial-grade\\" fireworks over the building. After initially observing the demonstration, police subsequently declared a riot around 11:00 p.m. after protesters had set fires in the street, smashed windows, burglarized a business, and a person threw a burning object into an occupied apartment building. According to police, protesters threw rocks and paint balloons at officers and set another dumpster on fire before they were pushed out of the area. Police said they used \\"crowd control munitions\\" but not CS gas to disperse the crowd; 19 protesters were arrested, mainly for disorderly conduct and interfering with a peace officer. Police began a search for the person that threw the burning object into the residential building. Killing of Aaron Danielson On August 29, clashes erupted between supporters of President Trump and Black Lives Matter protesters. Hundreds of Trump supporters took part in the \\"Trump 2020 Cruise Rally\\", a caravan of more than 100 cars and trucks displaying pro- Trump flags and signs, which drove through Portland, some of them using paintball guns and pepper spray on counter-protesters. The rally was set up by Belarussian and Ukrainian immigrants residing in Idaho who used an assumed name to organize the activities on Facebook and other social media. A participant in that caravan, a supporter of the right-wing group Patriot Prayer,What is the right-wing group Patriot Prayer linked to Portland confrontations and who is Joey Gibson? was shot and killed.Portland clashes: Fatal shooting as rival groups protest The victim was identified as Aaron Danielson, initially referred to by his alias \\"Jay\\" by Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson. Portland police issued an arrest warrant for Michael Reinoehl, a self-declared anti-fascist and supporter of antifa, who had regularly attended past protests in Portland and said he had provided \\"security\\" for the protests. He had been arrested in July for carrying a handgun, and had been shot in the arm while attempting to wrestle a gun away from a right-wing protestor. Reinoehl was later identified and killed by police in their attempts to apprehend him in Lacey, Washington on September 3. Prior to his death, Vice News broadcast freelance journalist Donovan Farley's interview with Reinoehl, in which Reinoehl claimed to have acted in self defense because he feared he and a friend were about to be stabbed. However, no knife was found on Danielson. A document released shortly after he was shot by police indicates Reinoehl hid in a parking garage and followed Danielson. A memorial vigil for Danielson was held in Vancouver, Washington's Esther Short Park on September 5. =September= On September 5, the 100th consecutive day of protests, two simultaneous sit-ins took place on the city's east side and at 2:00 p.m. a pro-Black Lives Matter \\"PDX Car Caravan\\" rally began on the Portland Community College Cascade campus. Portland United for Justice and Equality held a nonviolent protest at Pioneer Courthouse Square from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. while a vigil for black victims of police violence was held at Tom McCall Waterfront Park from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Between 8 and 9 p.m., hundreds of protesters were gathering at Ventura Park in preparation for a march despite announcements by police that a march was not permitted. The group began marching down Stark Street towards the PPB east precinct but were confronted by a line of riot police blocking their path. During the stand-off, someone in the crowd threw what authorities described as a molotov cocktail towards the police line-setting a protester's feet on fire in the process- after which a riot was declared; the injured man was later taken to the hospital in a private car, officials stated. Police began dispersing the crowd from the stand-off area using tear gas, pepper balls, and other munitions while making multiple arrests. According to authorities, rioters in Ventura Park used slingshots and threw rocks, fireworks, and other projectiles at officers, prompting arrests, with two of those arrested wearing body armor. Dumpsters, wooden pallets, and garbage cans were set on fire as groups of rioters \\"meandered\\" in the Mill Park area for four more hours before street activities died down. Overall, PPB arrested 43 people and the Oregon State Police arrested 16 with charges ranging from disorderly conduct to arson. Some police, including a sergeant, sustained injuries during the riots and an OSP vehicle was damaged by rocks. On September 10, Mayor Wheeler banned city police from deploying CS gas, the commonly used form of tear gas, for crowd control, while nevertheless urging cops to respond forcefully to violence. The city-level ban did not apply to federal officers. On September 15, a 36-year- old man was indicted by a grand jury after he had allegedly shined a blue laser directly into the eyes of police officers \\"on multiple occasions\\" during demonstrations in downtown Portland on August 25. He was charged with second degree assault, unlawful use of a weapon, and two counts of unlawful directing of light from a laser pointer. On September 16, KOIN reported that \\"Portland's protest streak has ended, with demonstrations becoming scarcer and less confrontational\\", and stated that poor air quality from nearby wildfires \\"caused the nightly demonstrations to subside shortly after passing the 100 night milestone.\\" The wildfire hiatus ended the 104-day streak of daily protests, causing them to subside by September 9. However, as air quality improved, organized protests resumed with Portland Democratic Socialists of America and the PNW Youth Liberation Front announcing new demonstrations for September 18 targeting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility near South Waterfront. On September 18, hundreds of protesters descended on the South Portland ICE building around 9:00 p.m. where armed federal officers in armor were seen waiting behind the building's gate. At 9:45 p.m., Portland police arrived and announced an unlawful assembly via LRAD as the protest had blocked streets near South Bancroft Street and South Moody Avenue. As the crowd grew unruly and objects were thrown, federal officers, including Federal Protective Service and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) personnel, began dispersing the crowd down the street using tear gas, smoke bombs, and impact munitions, while PPB flanked and made arrests; some protesters were seen using umbrellas as a shield wall according to images and footage captured by independent reporters and journalists. At least 11 arrests were made. PPB initially tweeted tear gas among the list of crowd control munitions they could use on the crowd, despite its use being banned by the mayor eight days prior. PPB Sgt. Kevin Allen said they were legally required to make that warning despite not using the agent, and Mayor Wheeler confirmed on September 19 that no tear gas was deployed by city police despite its use by federal forces. On September 23, 13 people were arrested at the protest. Multnomah County District Attorney's office will be pursing felony charges for riot and possession of a destructive device against a 23-year-old male transient who is a convicted assailant from Georgia. In a probable cause affidavit, it says a police officer saw the transient lighting the petrol bomb. =October=Vandalism Elk fountain in Plaza Blocks after the elk statue was removed on July 2, 2020. In early June, local businesses reported losses totaling millions of dollars as the result of vandalism and looting, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting. Local business owners of color launched the Portland Cleanup Project. On June 14, a statue of Thomas Jefferson was toppled from its pedestal. Vandalism of the bronze statue of York prompted the University of Portland to remove the figure from the Captain William Clark Monument on June 17.https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2020/06/university-of- portland-takes-down-statue-of-lewis-clark-slave-york.html A statue of the first U.S. president, George Washington, on Northeast Sandy Boulevard and 57th Avenue was toppled by demonstrators on June 18. On July 1‚Äì2, protesters set fire to the Elk sculpture and fountain in the Plaza Blocks that resulted in structural damage to the granite base; deemed a safety hazard by the Regional Arts & Culture Council, the city removed the unharmed elk on July 2, and later, the fountain. The Promised Land, also installed in the Plaza Blocks, was vandalized as well.https://www.koin.com/news/protests/terribly-upsetting- portland-takes-in-riot-damage/ The Portland federal courthouse was also repeatedly vandalized over the weeks of protests. Responses In Portland, the mayor determines which members of City Council administer which bureau, and the mayor is typically the commissioner in charge of the Portland Police Bureau. Days before the protests began, incumbent mayor Ted Wheeler had fallen short of the 50% threshold that would have given him an outright win in the city's primary election for his second term. In November 2020 he will face Sarah Iannarone in a runoff election. During his term, his performance in the role of police commissioner was the source of significant criticism. The United States Department of Justice found the city to be in \\"substantial compliance\\" on 200 requirements set out in a 2012 settlement regarding use of force on people with mental illness. However, protests throughout his term had highlighted the killing of numerous Portlanders, including some who appeared to be in mental distress. =Government= Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted, \\"Burning buildings with people inside, stealing from small and large businesses, threatening and harassing reporters. All in the middle of a pandemic where people have already lost everything. This isn't calling for meaningful change in our communities, this is disgusting.\\" Sara Boone, chief of Portland Fire & Rescue, attributed the protests and violence to Floyd's death and \\"a system that allows people of color to 'feel fear every day. The city implemented a curfew from 8pm on May 30 to 6am on May 31. On May 31, Wheeler extended the curfew for another night (8pm to 6am). He said the demonstration has been \\"co- opted by rioters and looters\\", and Jami Resch, chief of the Portland Police Bureau, called the rioters a \\"group of selfish individuals\\". On May 30, TriMet paused bus and MAX Light Rail service to and from downtown and the Rose Quarter after the demonstrations started. The following day, the agency stopped bus, MAX, and Portland Streetcar service starting at 3:30 p.m., and said in a statement: \\"Our hearts at TriMet are heavy following the violence that damaged our city overnight, along with the emotions that are so raw here and across the nation. While TriMet appreciates the First Amendment right to protest, we hope that it is done without violence or vandalism.\\" The Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) blocked the interchanges into the city along I-5, I-84, I-405, and U.S. Route 26. Willamette Week Matthew Singer said ODOT's move was \\"without precedent in recent memory\\". Motorized scooter services (including Lime and Spin) were temporarily suspended in select parts of Northwest and Southwest Portland, the Central Eastside, and the Lloyd District. On June 1, Gov. Kate Brown activated 50 National Guard and 100 state police troopers. Wheeler extended the same curfew for a third night. Billy J. Williams, United States Attorney for the District of Oregon, said at a press conference: \\"What I saw at the Justice Center ... was sickening. This has to stop and in order for that to happen in the city of Portland, we need help. We need bodies, we need more numbers to do something to stop this ridiculous violence. This just cannot keep up.\\" The city's curfew was lifted on June 2. Elected officeholders (including Wheeler, Williams, Multnomah County District Attorney Rod Underhill, and Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese), law enforcement officials, and black demonstrators and community leaders met for the first time. The Hawthorne Bridge's west-bound lanes were closed for security purposes on the evening of June 2. Resch said: The Oregon Convention Center's (OCC) spires were illuminated yellow as a \\"beacon of hope for our suffering and silenced communities of color\\". Metro, which operates the venue, said, \\"Our venues are located in areas with deep legacies of racial injustices and we support peaceful demonstrations to stand together to dismantle systemic racism and hatred.\\" Additionally, the OCC's executive director said the venue \\"is an economic driver for our state and the spires have become as much of a staple in the skyline as the White Stag on Burnside. We will continue to shine bright in community solidarity, providing a beacon of hope for Oregonians.\\" Mayor Ted Wheeler, with \\"THEODORE RESIGN\\" projected behind him, addressed a crowd of protestors on July 22, 2020 On June 5, Wheeler pledged to \\"limit the ways police respond\\" by restricting use of sonic weapons and tear gas \\"if police had a viable alternative\\". He tweeted: \\"Effective immediately, I have directed @Portlandpolice to use LRAD only to share information and not as a sonic warning tone function.\\" On June 17, City Council reduced the police bureau's budget by about $16 million, or six percent. On September 1, Wheeler denounced the riot that occurred on the night of August 31 outside of his residence as \\"senseless violence\\" and sent a letter to neighbors where he apologized and said he planned to move out. He had stated prior that he had no intentions to resign as mayor. On September 10, Wheeler banned the use of tear gas for riot control purposes, while affirming that police would continue to respond aggressively to violent protests and vandalism. In October 2020, Commissioners Hardesty and Eudaly proposed cutting an additional $18 million from the coming year's police budget, including cutting the budget for the police Rapid Response Team and the Special Emergency Reaction Team. According to Hardesty, \\"It has become clear to me through research and seeing tactics used during the 100+ days of protesting that the Police Bureau utilizes antiquated methods of protest policing.\\" The two commissioners will need a third vote on City Council to pass the change to the budget; Dan Ryan, elected in summer 2020, is reported to be considering it. Federal According to The Washington Post, White House officials had claimed that President Donald Trump became interested in federal operations against the protesters in Portland, seeing them as a means of underscoring his law-and-order message; an official added that \\"the White House had long wanted to amplify strife in cities,\\" and \\"It was about getting viral online content.\\" At the start of July, forces from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the U.S. Marshal Service, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Federal Protection Service arrived in Portland, appearing at the U.S. courthouse, where they fired pepper spray or tear gas at protesters who got too close to the building. DHS refers to its deployment in Portland as Operation Diligent Valor. The first federal arrest was recorded on July 2, and on July 10, protester Donavan La Bella suffered facial and skull fractures after being shot in the head by federal non-lethal rounds. On July 13, President Trump praised federal authorities for their response to the Portland protests, saying they had done \\"a great job\\". Speaking at the White House, Trump said, \\"Portland was totally out of control, and they went in, and I guess we have many people right now in jail and we very much quelled it, and if it starts again, we'll quell it again very easily. It's not hard to do, if you know what you're doing.\\" On July 16, Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf met with federal law enforcement officials in Portland after issuing a press release condemning \\"rampant, long-lasting violence\\" in Portland, including a timeline alleging violence by anarchists on Portland streets. Wolf said, \\"This siege can end if state and local officials decide to take appropriate action instead of refusing to enforce the law. DHS will not abdicate its solemn duty to protect federal facilities and those within them.\\" On July 19, Trump tweeted: The Federal Aviation Administration banned drone operation from July 16 to August 16 in the airspace under 1,000 ft from within one nautical mile of the Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt federal court house at the request of Department of Homeland Security. Both the mayor of Portland and the governor of Oregon called for federal officers to leave the city, with the governor describing the federal action as being \\"like adding gasoline to a fire\\". At a July 21 press conference, however, Acting DHS Secretary Wolf said federal law enforcement officers \\"will not retreat\\" in protecting government buildings in Portland. Federal officers arrested 43 people in Portland between July 4 and 21. On July 23, Michael Horowitz, the Department of Justice Inspector General, announced that he and the Inspector General's office at the Department of Homeland Security would be investigating the federal law enforcement responses in Portland, \\"examining the training and instruction that was provided to the DOJ law enforcement personnel; compliance with applicable identification requirements, rules of engagement, and legal authorities; and adherence to DOJ policies regarding the use of less-lethal munitions, chemical agents, and other uses of force.\\" Governor Kate Brown announced on July 29 that she had reached an agreement with Vice President Mike Pence for a phased withdrawal of federal officers from Portland. In return, the Oregon State Police would improve security around federal buildings. The agreement went in force on July 30, with state and local police guarding the buildings, and protests that night were peaceful. Following violent protests on the night of August 25, President Trump tweeted that Governor Brown and Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler should request the deployment of the National Guard to \\"end this problem immediately\\" while also urging them to \\"stop calling these anarchists and agitators 'peaceful protestors'\\". By August 27, 74 people faced federal charges related to the protests, with charges ranging from assaulting a federal officer to arson. On August 28, Mayor Wheeler wrote an open letter to President Trump asking him not to send the National Guard to the city, saying that \\"We don't need your politics of division and demagoguery.\\" Around this time, National Guard had been deployed to Kenosha, Wisconsin after similar unrest in that city.https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/514209-portland- mayor-responds-to-trump-stay-away- pleasehttps://www.portland.gov/sites/default/files/2020-08/8.28.20-letter-to- president-trump.pdf On September 1, in an effort to revoke funding, Trump issued a memo calling on Attorney General William Barr and the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to review and submit a detailed report on all federal funding to Portland, Seattle, New York City, Washington, D.C., and other \\"anarchist jurisdictions\\" that receive federal grants. \\"My administration will not allow federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,\\" Trump wrote. New York governor Andrew Cuomo called the action an \\"illegal stunt\\" and said the president is \\"not a king\\". On September 21, the Department of Justice designated Portland, Seattle, and New York City as jurisdictions that had failed to counteract violence and property destruction during protests. OMB will separately submit guidance on restricting the cities' eligibility for federal funding. = Police = On June 6, PPB chief of police Resch, announced that she had appointed Chuck Lovell as \\"the exact right person at the exact right moment\\" to serve as the new city police chief; Resch stated that she would remain on the force but in another role. Lovell, who became the bureau's fourth Black police chief, expressed hope that police and the community could join together to build trust and change the institutional disregard for human life that led to Floyd's death. A month later, on July 8, the executive board of the Portland Police Association expressed \\"no confidence\\" in City Council, and expressed frustration with its perceived lack of support for the police bureau. The following day, the PPB deputy police chief, Chris Davis, commented on the challenges of coordinating with federal officers, and the distinction between what he termed \\"legitimate protest\\" vs. \\"criminal activity.\\" After federal agencies began tactical operations in early July, Wheeler and others prominently objected to their presence, and assured the public that local police would not coordinate with the federal agents; however, this was contradicted by reporting from The Oregonian and elsewhere, which demonstrated various forms of coordination. Portland fire commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty barred local and federal police from using fire bureau property to stage tactical operations. State and local agencies have expressed concern about the effects of \\"unprecedented\\" amounts of gas deployed by police agencies on drinking water. =Community= Odd Fellows Building in opposition to Mayor Ted Wheeler Rev. Mondain√© of Portland's NAACP chapter spoke against looting and vandalism. Some restaurant owners expressed support for the protesters via social media and by contributing to organizations working to assist people of color and combat police brutality, among other causes. Le Pigeon sustained damage during the demonstrations; owner Gabriel Rucker said, \\"To the person that smashed my window last night I hear you and I hope you find a voice that screams louder than broken glass. To the person who broke my window last night I love you and if you were hungry I would cook you a meal.\\" The Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing organized a Zoom conference. More than 320 people participated, and committee members passed a resolution asking elected and law officials to \\"stand against white supremacy and police violence\\". Furthermore, the resolution says, \\"We must do more than make symbolic statements against racism. We must change the outcomes of policing, reducing incidents of violence, and the targeting of communities of color and other marginalized groups.\\" On June 1, the organization SOLVE organized a volunteer cleanup effort in downtown in collaboration with local businesses. Hundreds of volunteers filled approximately 150 trash bags, while social distancing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In late June, Rose City Justice, the organization that had organized the largest marches, ceased sponsoring marches in response to questions and concerns from other entities in the Black Lives Matter movement. Some expressed dissatisfaction with large demonstrations that did not directly engage in direct action and civil disobedience to effect change; others questioned whether the donations the group had received, which exceeded $24,000, were being put to appropriate use. Between September 3 and September 8, an online poll of 502 Oregon voters found that 66% of voters statewide disapproved of the ongoing Portland protests and said that they did not do much to improve the lives of Black citizens, with 55% of those specifically saying the nightly demonstrations in the city should be labeled as \\"riots\\" rather than \\"protests\\". The independent survey, conducted by DHM Research, also found that 59% of respondents disapproved of President Donald Trump's response to the protests, 58% disapproved of Mayor Ted Wheeler's handling of the unrest, and 56% gave negative marks to Governor Kate Brown's response, though more respondents strongly disapproved of the president's response than the governor or mayor's. In regards to police response to the protests, 46% approved while 45% disapproved, while 66% of those aged 18‚Äì29 believed police were using too much force, among other data points. The survey had a margin of error of 4.4 percent.https://www.dhmresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DHM-Panel- Protests-memo_final-September-2020.pdf DHM Research poll = Lawsuits = As of June 18, 2020, at least nine lawsuits had been filed by protesters and the non-profit Don't Shoot Portland against the City of Portland, asserting that the protesters had been injured or sent running in fear for their lives by indiscriminate and excessive police use of rubber bullets, explosive devices such as flash-bangs, and/or tear gas. The suits sought financial damages, and most also sought a ban on those means of crowd dispersal. On June 9, in response to the earliest suits, U.S. District Judge Marco A. Hernandez granted a 14-day temporary restraining order significantly restricting police use of tear gas. The Oregon chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against the City of Portland, the Portland Police Bureau, and other law enforcement entities on June 28, claiming that police targeted and attacked journalists and legal observers On July 17, the ACLU added the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the United States Marshals Service as defendants to that lawsuit, and on July 23, federal judge Michael Simon granted a 14-day temporary restraining order blocking federal law enforcement from arresting or using force against journalists or legal observers without probable cause, barring the arrest of journalists or legal observers for failure to disperse, and barring seizure of journalists' press passes or equipment unless they were being lawfully arrested. The ACLU later filed an additional lawsuit on behalf of medics. Local journalists Cory Elia and Lesley McLam sued the City of Portland and law enforcement agencies after having been arrested on June 30. The lawsuit sought a restraining order that would bar law enforcement officers from violating journalists' rights, as well as seeking damages for injuries, and it resulted in a restraining order. The Oregon Attorney General, Ellen Rosenblum, filed a lawsuit against DHS, the U.S. Marshals Service, Customs and Border Protection, and the Federal Protective Service, accusing the agencies of violating First, Fourth and Fifth amendment rights of Oregon residents by seizing and detaining protesters without probable cause, and asking for a temporary restraining order against such acts. On July 24, U.S. District Judge Michael Mosman ruled that the state lacked standing to file the suit and denied the state's request for a temporary restraining order. On July 27, Protect Democracy and Perkins Coie filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Wall of Moms, Don't Shoot Portland, and several protesters against DHS, Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Protective Service, the Department of Justice, and the heads of these federal agencies. The suit accuses the defendants of violating the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights and using excessive force, and it also claims that several of the \\"acting\\" officials haven't been confirmed for their roles and are overstepping their legal authority. The suit seeks to limit federal law enforcement to protecting federal property and to bar them from using specific actions, such as excessive crowd-control measures and custodial detentions without probable cause. On August 24, a legal team led by attorney David Sugerman filed a class action lawsuit against the federal government including Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf, Deputy Secretary Kenneth Cuccinelli and others as defendants, charging that the Trump administration violated protesters' Fourth Amendment rights when they tried to quell demonstrations by using tear gas and rubber bullets.https://www.newsweek.com/portland-protests-trump-admin-lawsuit- federal-agents-unconstitutional-1527500 More than one of the federal lawsuit lists John Does among the defendants, as the identities and agency affiliations of the officers accused of wrongdoing was not known.

Several political and policy developments have been influenced by the demonstrations. * Portland Public Schools and the other two school districts in Portland ended a program in which 12 Portland Police \\"school resource officers\\" patrolled the halls of nine high schools. * Portland police chief Jami announced she would step down June 8, and was succeeded by Chuck Lovell. * Portland City Council reduced the police bureau's funding by $15 million in June 2020, reallocating some of that amount to the Portland Street Response team. * The Oregon Legislative Assembly passed six criminal justice reform laws in June 2020 during a special session. * In July 2020, City Council referred a measure to the November 2020 ballot that would overhaul police oversight. The measure was championed by Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty, but has drawn criticism by City Auditor Mary Hull Caballero. * Mike Schmidt was elected District Attorney of Multnomah County in May 2020 with 76% of the vote. His term was not set to commence until January 2021, and outgoing DA Rod Underhill initially intended to serve out his full term. Underhill later decided to retire early, after urging the Governor to appoint Schmidt to succeed him. Upon assuming office in August 2020, Schmidt announced new policies which would limit prosecution of non-violent protesters. Schmidt's election has been characterized as marking a turning point from the legacy of longtime DA Mike Schrunk, and reflecting a nationwide trend of electing progressive DAs. * In August 2020 Portland State University disarmed its campus police force, following two years of advocacy from its student body and in response to incidents of police brutality. * An initiative called \\"Reimagine Oregon\\" was launched in July 2020 by the Urban League of Portland, the African-American Leadership Fund, and other groups. The group has published more than 100 policy proposals to address racial injustice, and invited the public to comment on the proposals by September 11.

Selective embryo abortion assumes that embryo termination depends on the genetic quality of seeds developing within an ovary, and predicts that successfully matured seeds will be of greater fitness than aborted seeds. Consequently, selective embryo abortion has the potential to act as a unique stage of natural selection, influencing the evolution of plant populations and species. This concept was described by botanist John T. Buchholz in 1922 under his framework of developmental selection, which referred to selective embryo abortion as ‚Äúinterovular selection.‚Äù Selective embryo abortion may result from competition among embryos for maternal resources. The maternal plant may also play an active role by recognizing and selectively aborting genetically inferior embryos. Evidence of offspring fitness effects support the hypothesis that abortion is a form of selection. However, abortion in some species may be due to factors independent of embryo fitness, including the position of embryos within an ovary and late-acting self-incompatibility.  Mechanisms of selective embryo abortion  Representation of the source-sink hypothesis as it relates to selective embryo abortion; embryos of high genetic quality are expected to be stronger sinks for maternal resources. The body of literature on selective embryo abortion was primarily published in the 1980s. During this time period, researchers proposed and investigated several hypotheses for the mechanisms of selective embryo abortion. These can be broadly grouped into two camps: competition among developing embryos and active ‚Äúfemale choice.‚Äù The former suggests that selective embryo abortion is driven by interactions among embryos as they compete for maternal resources such as sugars, water, and minerals. From the perspective of the source-sink hypothesis, each embryo acts as a sink, or recipient, of finite resources from roots and photosynthetic tissues. Since resources are limited, the number of existing ovules would be greater than the number of seeds the maternal plant can support, leading to competition for resources. Embryos may compete for resources by producing phytohormones involved in metabolism (such as auxin). Competition may also involve the production of biochemicals that directly hinder the development and growth of other embryos. In contrast, the hypothesis of female choice states that selective embryo abortion may be driven by the maternal plant, which identifies and aborts inferior embryos. However, it is unclear how the maternal plant may be able to assess genetic quality. It is possible, however, that interactions between the maternal plant and competing embryos may affect patterns of seed abortion; for example, patterns of resource consumption among embryos may signal to the maternal plant which embryos are of low fitness. Selective embryo abortion can also occur indirectly through fruit abortion. Indeed, seed and fruit development are interrelated and occur simultaneously. Accordingly, seed maturation‚Äîand therefore seed success‚Äîcan be precluded by fruit abortion.  Effects on offspring fitness  In general, there is significant overlap in gene expression between embryo development and plant maturation. Selective embryo abortion may therefore act on traits affecting plant survival and fitness following germination. Most studies that tested the effects of selective embryo abortion on offspring fitness, did so by reducing or eliminating competition among embryos; these studies typically evaluate differences in average fitness between offspring from unmanipulated plants and offspring from plants manipulated by random removal of embryos. Relative increases in certain measures of fitness among the former have been observed in species such as Cryptantha flava, Cryptantha officinale, Lotus Corniculatus, and others.  Position-dependent abortion  Matured seeds, aborted seeds, and unfertilized ovules of Mimulus guttatus (monkeyflower).Many species exhibit less variable patterns of embryo abortion. In species such as Medicago lupulinus, Nemophila breviflora, and Phaseolus coccineus, abortion appears to be affected by the relative position of an ovule within an ovary. A variety of within-ovary, position-dependent patterns have been observed, including: * Consistent maturation of embryos in particular positions * Greater probability of abortion among embryos closer to the style * Greater probability of abortion among embryos closer to the peduncle * Greater probability of maturation among embryos in the middle portion of the ovary * Alternation between matured and aborted embryos M. lupulinus and N. breviflora are also examples of species with a fixed number of matured seeds per fruit (in these cases, one seed), despite having multiple fertilized ovules. The arrangement of ovarian vascular bundles, which transport nutrients to ovules, has been proposed as a potential influence on position-dependent probabilities of abortion. Alternatively, in species where the order of ovule fertilization and relative positions of matured embryos correlate, fertilization time may have an effect; late-fertilized ovules are expected to lag behind in embryonic development, making them weaker competitors. More specifically, gametophytic selection may cause a correlation between fertilization order and position of matured embryos, since the fastest growing pollen tubes are expected to be the most fit and the first to fertilize ovules. In this scenario, the ovules fertilized first are expected to be stronger competitors due to their genetic quality, hence their higher probability of maturation. Thus, some cases of position-dependent abortion have the potential to be driven by selective embryo abortion.  Abortion of self-fertilized embryos  Early-acting inbreeding depression is a form of selective embryo abortion that acts on embryos produced by selfing or mating of close relatives. Inbreeding increases genetic homozygosity, allowing selection to elimination recessive, deleterious or lethal alleles (the presence of these deleterious alleles is referred to as genetic load). Thus, selective embryo abortion would be expected to purge genetic load among inbred offspring by aborting those embryos with deleterious genotypes. However, late-acting self-incompatibility also causes abortion of self-fertilized seeds, confounding identification of early-acting inbreeding depression.

It is a common species with a temperate distribution. Found in North America and South Africa, it grows on rocks. Taxonomy It was originally described in 1941 as a species of Parmelia by Edward Cain Berry. It was one of 93 species that was transferred to Xanthoparmelia when Mason Hale promoted that taxon from subgeneric to generic status in 1974. It is commonly known as the tight rock-shield. Description Xanthoparmelia lineola has a thallus that is tightly attached (adnate) on its rock substrate. Yellowish green in colour, it grows to in diameter. The lobes are irregular in shape and measure 0.8‚Äì2 mm wide. Isidia and soredia are not present on the thallus. The medulla is white with a flat lower surface. The rhizines are pale, unbranched, and measure 0.2‚Äì0.4 mm long. The lichen has well-developed apothecia (2‚Äì5 in diameter) that sit on rudimentary stalks. The ascospores are 6‚Äì7 by 9‚Äì12 um. Xanthoparmelia lineola contains the compounds salazinic, consalazinic, constipatic, protoconstipatic, and usnic acids. =Similar species= Xanthoparmelia lineola is one of several morphologically similar species that contain salazinic acid and form a continuum based on the degree of agnation to the substrate. X. coloradoensis is loosely attached, X. wyomingica is even more loosely attached, while X. chlorochroa at maturity is not attached to a substate (a vagrant lichen). Habitat and distribution Xanthoparmelia lineola is known from northern North America and South Africa. Populations from Australia previously considered X. lineola have been since characterized with DNA analysis and assigned to a new species, X. knudsenii. It has a widespread distribution in western North America. In a study of Xanthoparmelia lichens in Arizona, Thomas Nash observed that this species seemed to develop best at elevations of , where individuals grew to cover half or more of the exposed rock face beneath ponderosa pines. It is common on north-facing rocks in the Arizona desert. The lichen can also be found growing in dry habitats on tree bases covered with wind-blown dust. Five morphologically similar chemotypes of Xanthoparmelia lineola are known from North America: X. subdecipiens, X. cumberlandia, X. oleosa, and X. novomexicana.

Early life  Agnes was born on May 27, 1913. Due to financial problems, Agnes could not continue her education despite being an intelligent student.  Career  Agnes was a market woman between 1921 and 1929, she ventured into buying and selling business and later owned shops in Makola and Okaishie in Accra, a vital business canter in Ghana. By 1940, she became one of Ghana's renowned market women who was greatly revered by all.Agnes, worked hard and became the first Makola woman to open an account with the then Standard Bank of West Africa now Standard Chartered Bank, although those days the rich Makola women saved their earning at home in safes. Through her effort other market women and business men gained the trust to also save their earning with the bank and opened account with the bank. Apart from doing business, Agnes was a devoted Christian and activist. She was also staunch member of the of Convention People's Party (CPP) and supported Nkrumah by organizing the Makola Women Association and generated huge funds for Nkrumah's campaign in the fight for independence.She became close friends with Kwame Nkrumah when he had to stay with her for a short time after his arrival from the UK to Ghana to join the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) as General Secretary. In 1949 after the CPP was established, Agnes was the one who single-handedly mobilized the support of the market women for Kwame Nkrumah during Nkrumah's Campaign and got them to finance his activities. She organised several meetings at the market places for Kwame Nkrumah to speak with the market women. She became a vital member of the trade union groups and was the main reason for the ongoing trade between Britain and Ghana. In 1964, she built a very expensive house in Kokomlemle, furnished fully with air condition and rented it to the Nkrumah Government to be used as the official residence of Russians officials until Nkrumah was overthrown in the 1966 coup d'√©tat After Nkrumah was overthrown, Agnes was sent to an illegal custody by orders from Lieutenant Arthur. She was forced outside her home by more than 50 armed soldiers in the middle of the night. It was until Lieutenant Arthur was executed in 1967, that Agenes was released by Lieutenant General Joseph Arthur Ankrah and she returned to her business. By 1970s, Agnes became very wealthy and purchased several properties in London which she rented out.  Awards  Agnes was awarded a travelling scholarship in 1958, to the United Africa Company (UAC), a British company which mainly traded in West Africa, due to her hard work, commitment and honesty.This made her to be the first Ghanaian woman to have visited the UAC head office in the UK, the Netherlands, and Holland. She leveraged on her travelling opportunity and bought a vast variety of products in huge quantities aside her main product which is textiles, and brought to Ghana. She continued to fund and support the CPP and Kwame Nkrumah together with the market women.

It was designed and built by artist Mark Cline, at the request of marina owner George W. Barber. History The idea for a Stonehenge replica in Alabama originated with billionaire dairy magnate George W. Barber. In 1991, Barber had commissioned Virginia artist Mark Cline of Enchanted Castle Studios to design and install seven life-size dinosaurs as \\"lawn ornaments\\" on one of his properties. While Cline was onsite repairing hurricane damage to the sculptures in 2006, Barber, perhaps aware of the recent installation of Cline's Foamhenge replica in Virginia, asked him to build a life-size Stonehenge replica at his Vintage Motorsports Museum outside of Birmingham, Alabama. By the time Cline was able to begin work on the project in 2012, Barber had relocated four of the dinosaurs to the grounds of Barber Marina and decided to instead install the Stonehenge replica on the marina grounds, in the woods to the north of the dinosaurs. The name Fiberhenge was briefly considered for the work, but Cline decided that it \\"didn't have the ring\\" he wanted and instead named the installation Bamahenge. Structure Bamahenge is a full-scale replica of Stonehenge, measuring tall and across. Like Stonehenge, the installation is oriented so that the sun rises over the center of three lintels on the outer markers on the summer solstice. Bamahenge is not an exact replica, however: the monument is constructed from only four different shapes of fiberglass \\"stones\\", oriented in different ways. The pieces were designed so that the smaller ones could nest inside the larger ones for transportation from Cline's Virginia studio to the Alabama coast, which required four flatbed tractor-trailer loads. Located only from the Gulf of Mexico, Bamahenge is located in an active tropical storm and hurricane zone. To protect the work from high winds, each \\"stone\\" is anchored by a wooden pole extending up into the \\"stone\\" and a similar distance underground. The lower portion of the \\"stone\\" and a pit beneath, surrounding the pole, are filled with concrete. Access Bamahenge is located west of the access road to Barber Marina. A small parking area sits at the head of the path to the monument. While most closely located to the unincorporated community of Josephine in Baldwin County, Alabama, Bamahenge is more often associated with the larger nearby town of Elberta, Alabama.

Owned and operated by the Star Stations group for most of its history, it broadcast from October 22, 1961, to September 2, 1976. History Indiana Broadcasting Company, owner of WISH (1310 AM), was granted a construction permit to build a new radio station on 107.9 FM in Indianapolis on July 21, 1960. Construction on WISH-FM, which would be the fourth commercial FM outlet in Indianapolis and one of the most powerful in the state, was underway by March 1961. The station began broadcasting on October 22, 1961, simulcasting WISH's full service output beginning at noon and airing taped musical programs after 7 p.m. In January 1962, WISH-FM began to air an hour a day of stereo programming, making it the first station with regular stereo broadcasts in the area. When Corinthian Broadcasting, which owned the WISH radio stations and WISH-TV (channel 8), decided to focus on its chain of television stations, the radio operations were sold to the Star Stations group of Omaha, Nebraska, in 1963 for $1.25 million. WISH-AM-FM became WIFE-AM-FM after the sale. The two stations initially simulcast, and as a result, the issues that were faced by the WIFE AM operation affected the FM license as well. After receiving a second short-term renewal in 1965, the Federal Communications Commission designated WIFE's licenses for hearing in 1966 over two contests conducted over the station in late 1964. The FCC Broadcast Bureau initially recommended a denial in 1967. WIFE ultimately received a renewal of its license through to 1970; in November 1969, Burden took out a full-page advertisement in the Indianapolis Star newspaper, titled \\"WIFE tells it like it really was\\", seeking to dispel the bad reputation that the troubles had caused. Eventually, WIFE-FM became an automated beautiful music station; in 1967, it was noted as playing \\"the best of Broadway and show tunes\\", airing just eight commercials per hour with a policy of no hard jingles. It had just two dedicated staff. Revelations that the Indianapolis and Portland, Oregon- area Star Stations operations had been involved in favorable treatment to candidates for United States Senate, including Vance Hartke in Indiana, led to a five-year revocation hearing that spanned the early 1970s. While a competing applicant‚ÄîIndianapolis Broadcasting, Inc.‚Äîsought the WIFE AM frequency, there was no comparable challenger seeking the WIFE-FM license. While earlier actions opened the door to WIFE AM being transferred to new ownership while Burden was allowed to retain the other stations, this was overturned by the commission in January 1975, when the FCC denied renewals to all of the Star Stations. Burden filed two court appeals, which failed; the FCC also denied a last-minute application by Indianapolis Broadcasting, which had taken over WIFE AM on June 1, 1976, to operate WIFE-FM on an interim basis. As the new Indianapolis Broadcasting-owned WIFE opted to retain the call letters and format of the preceding station, Star Stations owner Don W. Burden moved to rebrand WIFE-FM to avoid confusion with its former stablemate. In the spring of 1976, WIFE-FM changed formats from beautiful music to country rebranded as \\"CB-108\\", and Burden requested‚Äîbut never received‚Äîthe call letters WXCB, which prompted opposition from WXTZ (103.3 FM). The station closed at 12:01 a.m. on September 2, 1976, as prescribed by the FCC; Jay Reynolds of WIFE AM gave the final announcement over the station, and nine jobs were lost with its closure. =Hearings for a successor= With no interim operator for the 107.9 FM frequency in Indianapolis, WIFE-FM's closure opened the door for new applications. After receiving nine applications by the November 1976 cut-off date, the FCC designated five bids for comparative hearing in 1978, from Peoples Broadcasting Corporation; Radio Circle City, headed by former WIFE-AM- FM general manager Robert Kiley; Mediacom; Radio Corporation of Indiana, consisting of several local investors; and Indianapolis Communications Corporation. The FCC did not rule in favor of any of the applications until May 1982, when it selected Peoples. However, the winning applicant had developed a flaw in the intervening years, as Peoples head Joseph Cantor died in September 1981. FCC rules which froze the qualifications of competing applicants at a certain point in time meant that the two ruling administrative law judges had to consider Peoples as if Cantor was still alive. The losing bidders appealed, but the FCC review board and the full commission upheld the decision. Peoples would begin broadcasting over 107.9 MHz as WTPI on October 15, 1984, more than eight years after WIFE-FM's closure.

Kapita, M.D. is a doctor from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo who aided in initial research efforts investigating HIV/AIDS in Africa in the 1980s and 1990s. Dr. Kapita is credited as one of the first African scientists to independently identify that AIDS was prevalent in Central Africa. Research work in collaboration with Project SIDA helped identify and publicize the heterosexual sexual transmission of HIV. Following his research career, he continued caring for patients with HIV/AIDS and has more recently returned to practicing cardiology.  Biography  Early life and career = Bila M. Kapita was raised in a Swedish mission in the Bas-Congo province of the former Belgian Congo. Kapita received medical training in Brussels, Belgium at the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, where he focused on cardiology, publishing several research articles on the subject dating back to 1975. Upon return to Zaire, Kapita practiced cardiology and general medicine at the Mama Yemo Hospital, becoming head of internal medicine. Dr. Kapita was well established in Kinshasa and served as the head of the Kinshasa Medical Association. = Work with HIV/AIDS in Kinshasa = Kapita noted in retrospect that patients at his hospital displayed an increased amount of Kaposi‚Äôs sarcoma beginning in the mid-1970s. Around the same time, patients were more frequently suffering from Cryptococcal meningitis. Both diseases are opportunistic infections which were significant of decreased immune system response in patients. Following the initial connection between these opportunistic infections in the Unites States in 1981, African scientists including Kapita recognized the similar clinical presentation. The prevalence of what would soon become known as AIDS in African countries caught the attention of European and American researchers. The United States‚Äô Centers for Disease Control and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases were alerted to the rising pandemic by former collaborators in Ebola research from Europe such as Peter Piot. A group of researchers from Belgium, the United States, and France were first introduced to the state of Africa‚Äôs AIDS pandemic in the isolation wards of Kapita‚Äôs hospital. Dr. Kapita was welcoming to the international researchers, allowing them to work from his hospital for long periods of time. Due to Dr. Kapita's notability in Kinshasa, he was able to protect these scientists from any government discontent involving outside research at the time. Peers described Kapita as being true to his ideals and well trained. Patients in the wards of Mama Yemo were clearly affected by AIDS per the clinical definitions in place at that time. Almost all of the patients confirmed to have AIDS using laboratory based tests were already identified by Dr. Kapita without laboratory tests. Kapita is credited by his collaborators as being one of the first people in Africa to identify the presence of AIDS. The visiting researchers would soon realize the extent of AIDS in Africa and began research in Kinshasa. The resulting collaboration between African, American, and European scientists would become known as Project SIDA. Dr. Bila M. Kapita published his own book in 1988 titled SIDA en Afrique. = Project SIDA = From 1984 to 1991 Kapita collaborated with Project SIDA at Mama Yemo, producing between 20 and 30 research articles on the transmission, history, and future of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Work was conducted in Kapita's hospital early on in the program to increase chances of approval from government authorities. Many of Kapita‚Äôs articles focused on the rate of heterosexual transmission that was largely ignored by the United States in the early 1980s. Dr. Kapita was present at the first International AIDS Conference in Atlanta, Georgia in 1985. Also in attendance were Project SIDA collaborators Peter Piot and Nzila Nzilambi‚Äîas well as thousands of other scientists. During the second International AIDS Conference in Paris, France, Dr. Kapita informed the community of his retrospective discovery of increased cases of Kaposi's sarcoma and cytomegalovirus, indicators that HIV/AIDS likely existed in Kinshasa as far back as 1975. Prior to public knowledge of HIV prevalence in Zaire at the time, Kapita faced the threat of becoming a political prisoner under Mobutu Sese Seko‚Äôs regime for acknowledging the issue on a global stage without permission from the government. In 1990, with the rumblings of civil war beginning in Zaire, Dr. Kapita worked with Peter Piot in arranging an international AIDS conference in Kinshasa. The proceeds of the conference were returned to the region through donations to Mama Yemo Hospital and the establishment of a health clinic in Kapita's village. = Career Following Project SIDA = Kapita's work continued for a few years following the 1991 demise of Project SIDA. A notable collaboration featuring Dr. Kapita in 1992 was the World Health Organization publication: AIDS in Africa: A Manual for Physicians. Following the end of Project SIDA due to civil war in Zaire, Dr. Kapita continued to appear on international research articles, the last being published in 1993. Kapita continued to work at Mama Yemo, until at least 1997, treating patients with HIV/AIDS. A hallmark of Project SIDA was the training of Congolese researchers, resulting in many well-trained doctors such as Kapita existing in Kinshasa. American and European collaborators established traditional research procedure in Kinshasa, establishing an institutional review board led by Dr. Kapita. Kapita and the other Zairian collaborators of Project SIDA wished to return to research, but opportunities following the civil war were limited. Currently, Dr. Kapita practices cardiology at the Centre Medical De Kinshasa in Gombe, Kinshasa.  Partial bibliography  Piot, Peter, et al.

During her period with the Bradshaw family she wrote a series of diaries and letters which were published, in a compiled form, in 2011. Her records furnish some lively accounts of people and daily life in the early years of Alice Springs, which was then called Stuart, when it was a tiny one- hotel settlement and give details about the children she taught (including Doris Blackwell; another strong character is Amelia Kunoth), the clothes she wore, remote places she visited, passing explorers and missionaries and the active social life of the small settlement.  Life in the Northern Territory  Taylor was 30-years old when she accepted the position of governess for the Bradshaw family when they lived at the Alice Springs Telegraph Station and she travelled there from Adelaide in May 1905. This journey was a long and difficult one with the train going only as far as Oodnadatta; followed by a buggy ride of more than 300 miles and having to make camp each night. In this position she replaced Mrs Louisa Cornock, a widow and experienced teacher, and she was much less of a disciplinarian then her predecessor with a much more casual style. Atlanta Bradshaw was, however, very happy with her and described her as a self-confident young woman from a reasonably privileged family. On the trip to Alice Springs Taylor wrote a detailed diary of the trip including: * Adelaide to Oodnadatta - 21 to 28 May 1095; where she described the country as \\"meadows and papachilna utterly dry and forsaken looking\\" * Oodnadatta to Alice Springs - 29 May - 13 June 1905; where she goes into details about each days camp and the people on the journey Immediately on her arrival to Alice Springs Taylor shocked the local population by wearing a divided skirt on horseback instead of riding side saddle as was customary for women at the time. Doris Blackwell, in her book \\"Alice on the Line\\" goes into more detail about this saying: Blackwell's book \\"Alice on the Line\\" often adds detail to what Taylor described more economically and it is clear, from both women, that they regarded each other with deep respect. Taylor wrote of Blackwell that: During her time in Alice Springs Taylor was very much involved in the social life of the town and photographs of that period, taken by Thomas Bradshaw, are held a Library & Archives NT in the Thomas Bradshaw Collection and the State Library of South Australia in the Vernon Smith Collection (this collection holds copies that Taylor purchased from Bradshaw and were later donated by her nephew). These pictures include many picnics, tennis parties and horse riding outings. In 1907, after 18-months in Alice Springs (having already extended her time there by 6 months) Taylor decided to leave and it is not recorded why she made that decision, except that it was expiated by her desire to be at her brother Sid's marriage. It is also thought that, although she did not tell anyone, she knew that she had contracted Tuberculosis. It is unknown whether Taylor knew about her illness but when she left Alice Springs but it is clear that she had no plans but to spend time with her family and, by August 1907, was admitted to a specialist tuberculosis hospital (Kalyra in the Adelaide Hills). Rosemary Kennedy, who compiled Taylor's letters and diaries, believes that Taylor may have known of her illness before travelling to Alice Springs and hoped that the climate would cure her but; Kennedy also notes that there are many references to interactions with tuberculosis suffers in Alice Springs and the illness could have been contracted from them. Taylor's last letter from Alice Springs (31 January 1907), to her mother, Taylor says that: The Bradshaw family found it very hard to replace Taylor and Blackwell wrote that \\"there just weren't any takers for the position; either the Australian spirit of adventure was waning or governesses had discovered the value of money and wanted more then my father was able to pay\\". Blackwell was nearly 16 when Taylor left and she had to take over tutoring her younger siblings for their remaining year in Alice Springs.  Later life  After her return to Adelaide she was later discharged from the hospital into the care of her mother and died, at home, on 26 January 1909; aged 34.

She was best known as editor of Beloit Poetry Journal and as a scholar of the Romantic period, specifically the circle of writers and thinkers associated with poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron. LifeEarly life and education= Marion Stocking was born in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on June 4, 1922, the oldest daughter of William and Louisa (Schucholtz) Kingston. She grew up in Melrose, Massachusetts, and graduated magna cum laude from Mount Holyoke College in 1943 with an A.B. in English composition. She went on to study English literature as a graduate student at Duke University, receiving her PhD in 1952. At Duke she worked with Newman Ivey White, an eminent scholar of the Romantic period. Her doctoral research, which focused on Claire Clairmont, a step-sister of Mary Shelley and lover of Lord Byron, led to her dissertation, \\"Claire Clairmont: a biographical and critical study,\\" and to a long career as a Romanticist. =Career= Stocking's teaching career began in 1946 at the University of Maine Orono. In 1950 she accepted a position at the University of Colorado, where she taught until spring of 1954 and served as an editorial intern for the Colorado Quarterly. Marion K. Stocking, To the Wilderness: A Memoir, University of Delaware Press (2010), p. 209. Print. She taught at Beloit College from 1954 (when she was the first woman to be hired to a tenure-track position in the English department) until her retirement in 1984. She was promoted to associate professor in 1959 and to professor in 1965. Upon her arrival at the college, she was assigned a shared office with David Mackenzie Stocking. They married in 1955. She also joined him on the editorial staff of the Beloit Poetry Journal, a quarterly review of contemporary poetry founded in 1950 as a college publication by poet and colleague Chad Walsh and Robert H. Glauber, an art historian. It soon became clear that Marion Stocking was a talented critic of contemporary poetry. She wrote book reviews for the journal from 1964 to 2008, establishing a national reputation as an insightful and judicious reader, and promoting the careers of A.R. Ammons, Mary Oliver, Alice Fulton, and many others. Editor and poet Philip Fried wrote in his tribute to her in the Fall/Winter 2009/2010 issue of The Manhattan Review, \\"she was one of the most knowledgeable and sympathetic readers of contemporary poetry I have ever known.\\" The journal eventually became a life project for her and David Stocking. They shared editorial duties until his death in 1984, after which Marion continued as editor-in-chief, setting a goal of making the journal financially self-sustaining. This was achieved when the editorial board created the Beloit Poetry Journal Foundation, thanks in part to a $50,000 grant from the Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation. Roxanne Moore Saucier, \\"A Fine Line Mainer‚Äôs Nurturing of Beloit Poetry Journal‚Äôs Diverse Voice Evident in Half-Century Retrospective,\\" Bangor Daily News, March 8, 2001. Print. Other editors who worked with Marion on the journal over the years included David Ignatow, Bink Noll, John Rosenwald, Ann Arbor, and Lee Sharkey. During Marion Stocking's long tenure, the journal was the first or early publisher of such poetic luminaries as Charles Bukowski, Anne Sexton, W.S. Merwin, Adrienne Rich, Philip Levine, Sharon Olds, Jonathan Aldrich, Galway Kinnell, and Sherman Alexie. In 2000, Marion Stocking edited the journal's 50th anniversary anthology, A Fine Excess. Stocking published two major works of scholarship, both focused on the life and associations of Mary Shelley's step-sister Claire Clairmont. Both works are significant for the light they shed on the lives and thinking of Percy Shelley and Lord Byron and their friends. The first appeared in 1968: The Journals of Claire Clairmont, 1814‚Äì1827, edited with the assistance of David Mackenzie Stocking. The second publication, appearing in 1995, was a two-volume collection of The Clairmont Correspondence, 1808‚Äì1879, the culminating work of a career of biographical research. William St Clair, reviewing the volumes for the Literary Review, called the publication \\"an event in literary history. The last remaining unpublished source for Shelley and Byron, and for the long Victorian aftermath endured by the women, is now made available in a magnificent edition. Most of the letters are published in full for the first time. Marion Kingston Stocking ... is the perfect editor, and the book is a delight.\\" In recognition of her scholarly achievements, Stocking received the Keats-Shelley Society Distinguished Scholar Award in 1996 and the International Byron Society Elma Dangerfield Prize in 1997. With funds provided by friends of the Stockings in 1984, Beloit College established the David & Marion Stocking Prize, which is awarded annually to the student who submits the best piece of non-fiction prose. =Post-retirement= Upon retirement, Stocking moved to Lamoine, Maine, where she and her husband had spent their summers since 1970. In addition to her editorial work, Marion Stocking devoted fifteen years of service to the Maine arts community, first as a member of the Maine Arts Commission (1984‚Äì1988) and then as chair of its Literature Panel (1986‚Äì1988). She later served as a commissioner and chair of the Community Arts Committee (1993‚Äì1999). In 1997 she edited the Hancock County Cultural Directory. Meanwhile, she continued teaching and mentoring for special projects as a faculty associate of the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine. Until 1992, Stocking continued her work as a licensed bird bander for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, having begun this work in Wisconsin in 1960. Her memoir, \\"A Boomer's Journal,\\" recounts episodes as a naturalist observing prairie chicken populations. She supported land conservation, particularly in the remote parts of Maine. She was one of the group of environmentalists that founded Quoddy Regional Land Trust in coastal Washington County. She was concerned about the destruction of the natural environment. Marion Stocking died of cancer May 12, 2009, after a short illness and brief hospital stay. David Lehman, series editor for Best American Poetry, honored her with a memorial statement: \\"Blessed be they who read poetry for pleasure and write about it with passion and joy. Marion K. Stocking, who edited the Beloit Poetry Journal and wrote about contemporary poetry with the ardor of a true believer, died on Tuesday at the age of 86. She was a great lady.\\" Marion Stocking's papers are housed in the Beloit College Archives, and she is represented in the Maine Women Writers Collection in the archives of the University of New England.

The protests began as local protests in Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul the day after George Floyd was killed during an arrest in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020, before reaching other locations in the U.S. state of Minnesota, the United States, and internationally. The events are ongoing.  Background  In the years prior to the death of George Floyd, Minneapolis had seen several police officer- involved shootings and subsequent protests. In 2015, the shooting of Jamar Clark resulted in no repercussions for the Minneapolis Police Department (MPD) officers involved, and in 2016, the shooting of Philando Castile in nearby Falcon Heights resulted in a jury acquittal for an involved officer. In 2017, the shooting of Justine Damond, by a black police officer, resulted in a twelve-and-a-half-year prison sentence. After Floyd's death, Minneapolis residents responded to the buildup of unanswered grievances and the lack of concrete changes to living conditions due to pseudo structural racism.  Locations  Albert Lea = On June 2, hundreds of protesters rallied for police accountability at the Freeborn County Courthouse and then marched around town despite severely hot weather. Director of Public Safety JD Carlson told protesters that he did not support Chauvin's actions against Floyd in Minneapolis, and offered an open door between the community and the police department. Freeborn County Sheriff Kurt Freitag expressed concern for the protesters, and recommended that they come prepared with water and sun protection if protesting in summer. = Austin = On May 31, protesters rallied at Bandshell Community Park and marched to the law enforcement center before returning to the park and disbanding. Another protest occurred on the 25th of July. = Bemidji = On May 30, between 300 and 500 protesters marched from Paul Bunyan Park to the Bemidji Police Department; the demonstration was peaceful until some protesters attacked a D.A.R.E. truck, which then backed into a crowd of demonstrators and mildly injured an event volunteer. After the protest, mayor Rita Albrecht signed a declaration of a curfew between 8:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m. = Brainerd = On May 29, over 60 people gathered at a busy intersection to support Black Lives Matter and protest the death of George Floyd. = Duluth = On May 28, around 100 protesters blocked traffic at a busy intersection to protest the death of George Floyd. On May 30, several hundred protesters temporarily blocked portions of Interstate 35. Several highways closed, including Interstate 35, Interstate 394, Interstate 94 and Highway 55. A curfew from 10 p.m. CDT through 6 p.m. CDT Sunday morning was imposed by Duluth city leaders. On May 31, more than 1,000 protesters marched on I-35. Eight properties were damaged including an expletive written on the ground below the Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial for historical lynching victims. On June 19, hundreds marched in Duluth for Juneteenth. = Ely = On June 6, approximately 250 protesters marched down Chapman Street from Central Avenue to Whiteside Park in support of Black Lives Matter. The protest was peaceful with no incidents of violence. Once arriving at the park, most protesters kneeled in silence for 8 minutes 46 seconds. = Mankato = On May 29, hundreds of protesters marched through downtown Mankato in a peaceful demonstration. The rally began at Veterans Memorial Bridge and went through Washington park and to the Mankato Public Safety Center. = Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul = Minnesota National Guard and local law enforcement standing guard at the Minnesota State Capitol building in St. Paul on May 30 A billboard above a homeless camp stating \\"Twin Cities Curfew. Please stay home\\" on June 1 The first George Floyd protests took place in Minneapolis on May 26, the day after his death while under the custody of Minneapolis police officers, and spread to neighboring St. Paul. On May 28, after protests turned violent, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a state of emergency and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the Minnesota National Guard. Demonstrations in Minneapolis‚ÄìSt. Paul are ongoing as protesters seek justice for Floyd and reform of policing, and have inspired protests and political action in Minnesota, the United States, and internationally. On June 9, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz issued a statewide proclamation declaring eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence at 11:00 a.m. CDT to coincide with the beginning of Floyd's funeral in Houston, Texas. The length of time was how long Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd on the pavement using his knee. = Owatonna = On May 31, over 200 protesters demonstrated along Hoffman Drive to show solidarity with George Floyd. They traveled to the Law Enforcement Center, where they spoke with officers from Owatonna and from neighboring counties. They also held a moment of silence for eight minutes and forty-six seconds to honor Floyd. = Rochester = On May 29, over 150 protesters marched from Soldiers Field to the Government Center building and back to protest the death of George Floyd. On June 7, protesters marched from Silver Lake to the Olmsted County Government Center. = St. Cloud = On May 29, after hundreds of people gathered for a memorial for George Floyd at Lake George Township, a portion of the crowd marched through downtown St. Cloud, stopping at the Stearns County Courthouse to hold a moment of silence for Floyd before turning back to Lake George. = Woodbury = On June 1, a group of about 40 protesters gathered in Ojibway Park to rally against police brutality. Another protest took place on June 4 as protesters marched from Colby Lake to Woodbury City Hall.

In first plan are busts of Mi≈°a Pantiƒá, ≈Ωikica Jovanoviƒá ≈†panac and ƒåeda Milosavljeviƒá. Bela Crkva incident was an event that took place in village Bela Crkva near Krupanj on 7 July 1941, when a group of Partisans led by ≈Ωikica Jovanoviƒá ≈†panac killed two gendarmes, who were enforcing ban on political rallies after German occupation of Serbia. The event was latter taken as beginning of uprising in Serbia led by Communist Party of Yugoslavia against Axis occupiers and their collaborators.  Background  After Yugoslav debacle in April War, Germany and their allies dismantled the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Serbia proper was organized in occupation zone called Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. Germans also set up a puppet Commissar Government of Milan Aƒáimoviƒá and kept pre-war gendamerie in order to maintain order. Germans also ban all political activities in their occupation zone. Outlawed in the interwar period, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia began its preparations for an uprising as soon as Royal Yugoslav Army capitulated. German invasion on Soviet Union sped up activities of CPY. Also, Germans and their collaborators begun arresting man who were suspected of being communists. Politburo of Central Comity of CPY on its meeting held in Belgrade on 4th July 1941, (attained by Josip Broz Tito, Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, Milovan ƒêilas, Ivan Milutinoviƒá, Ivo Lola Ribar, Svetozar Vukmanoviƒá, Sreten ≈Ωujoviƒá) decided that time has come for armed resistance. Next day, occupation authorities begun with killing hostages, as gendarmes shot 13 hostages (10 communists and 3 Jews). Western Serbia and ≈†umadija were regions where first partisans detachments were formed. Among them was Valjevo detachment with Raƒëevina company. Political commissar was journalist and teacher ≈Ωikica Jovanoviƒá ≈†panac, a veteran of Spanish Civil War. Among others, in Raƒëevina company were physician and teacher .  The incident  Sunday, 7th July was the day of the traditional village fair on Saint John's Day (according to Julian calendar). , a law student, spread rumours that about a political rally would take place later that day. Village chief Sredoje Kne≈æeviƒá attempted to disperse gathered people, but in vain. The group of 15 armed partisans entered Bela Crkva from nearby forest around 4 PM and headed toward the tavern to give a speech. Rally was started by village resident Bogoljub Rakiƒá, a shoemaker and soldier of Raƒëevica company. Following him, Mi≈°a Pantiƒá, ƒåeda Milosavljeviƒá and ≈Ωikica Jovanoviƒá addressed the gathered people from the steps of the tavern that was located there. They spoke about the shameful capitulation, about the occupation of the country and the regime of terror and exploitation, about domestic traitors who help the occupiers, about the Soviet Union and the strength of the Red Army, reminded the audience of the fighting traditions of this area, such as Cer, Maƒçkov kamen and Guƒçevo, and invited them to join the partisan ranks. Different sources and testimonies claim that the peasants responded positively to speeches, and several young men decided to join them. After receiving new fighters, partisans headed in the direction of the forest where they came from. Bojaniƒá remained in Bela Crkva. Shortly after the departure of the partisans, a gendarmerie patrol from nearby village Zavlaka arrived in the village, which in the meantime was informed about the arrival of \\"armed communists\\". Sergeant and Corporal Milenko Brakoviƒá were on patrol, and they began to ask about identity of partisans and disperse the gathered people to their homes. Bojaniƒá, then went after the partisans and told them about the arrival of the gendarmes, so Jovanoviƒá made the decision to return and disarm them. Approaching the place where the speech was held, they saw the crowd caused by the gendarmes. Partisans then took cover, and Jovanoviƒá continued across the clearing towards the gendarmes and the crowd. He was followed by three partisans. When he approached them about fifteen meters away, one of those gathered shouted at the gendarmes that the Partisans had arrived, to which they turned and shouted at Jovanoviƒá to surrender, to which he replied that they were handing over their weapons. One of the gendarmes then shot at Jovanoviƒá, but did not hit him, to which he responded almost simultaneously with shots from his Steyr M1912 pistol. Lonƒçar was immediately fatally shot and fell to the ground, while the other was shot, but he also soon fell hit. At the same time, one of the partisans from Jovanoviƒá's entourage shot at the gendarmes. All sources agree that Jovanoviƒá killed Lonƒçar, but it is unclear who exactly killed Brakoviƒá. After the shooting, Jovanoviƒá approached the killed gendarmes and took their rifles. These rifles were given to the new fighters who joined the company that day. To the gathered peasants, who were surprised by the speed of events and the unexpected turn of the situation, Jovanoviƒá said - \\"This is how all those who will serve the occupier will pass.\\" After the action, Bojaniƒá joined the company, as he could no longer stay in the village. The action performed at the fair in Bela Crkva, quickly resonated in Raƒëevina and the entire Valjevo region. For days, there was talk about the appearance of partisans and their confrontation with the gendarmes. The people spun various stories, which were usually exaggerated, but the collaborationist press from Belgrade itself, writing about this event as the \\"beginning of communist riots in Serbia\\", spread the news about the appearance of partisans.  Aftermath  Coat of arms of Krupanj municipality with year 1941 as reference to event in Bela Crkva. Immediately after the liberation of Yugoslavia, on 27 June 1945, the National Assembly of Serbia made a decision to declare 7 July a holiday - the Day of the Uprising of the People of Serbia. ≈Ωivorad Jovanoviƒá ≈†panac, Mi≈°a Pantiƒá and were also decorated by the Order of the People's Hero. Holiday was celebrated until political changes in Serbia after downfall of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. New parliamentary majority led by ƒêinƒëiƒá's Democratic Party and Ko≈°tunica's Democratic Party of Serbia on 9th July 2001 revoked decision from 1945. During the following years, representatives of state institutions and anti-communist individuals from the ruling civic parties, as well as revisionist historians, with parallel efforts of the Serbian Orthodox Church, tried to revise the historical event. At the beginning of 2000s, the remains of Lonƒçar and Brakoviƒá were exhumed and re-buried in the church of St. George in Bela Crkva. They both were legally rehabilitated by a decision of ≈†abac district court in 2008.

He was one of the first Western employees at Nintendo and is known for programming the Mario face in Super Mario 64, as well as his work on titles such as Star Fox, 1080¬∞ Snowboarding, and Steel Diver. In 2002, he founded Vitei, a video game developer based in Kyoto, Japan, for which he serves as CEO. CareerArgonaut Games= Giles Goddard's interest in computers began when he was a teenager, when he used his ZX Spectrum, and later his Commodore Amiga, to create demoscene works in his spare time. In his Amiga demos, he experimented with 3D wireframe graphics with filled polygons. During this time, Argonaut Software released Starglider 2, one of the first computer games to use filled polygons. Goddard soon left school before finishing his A-levels and joined Argonaut Games, where his first task was porting Starglider 2 to the Macintosh SE. Argonaut would develop a reputation for creating cutting-edge, 3D games. They produced a 3D graphics demo for Nintendo Entertainment System and collaborated with Nintendo to produce the Game Boy title X, one of the few Game Boy games to feature 3D graphics. =Nintendo= When Goddard was 18 or 19, he moved to Kyoto to work for Nintendo, where he, alongside fellow Argonaut employee Dylan Cuthbert, helped develop Star Fox and Stunt Race FX. Goddard remained with Nintendo during the Nintendo 64 era. He assisted with the demo of Link fighting an enemy, which would be shown at the Shoshinkai 1995 trade show. To show off skinning, he programmed the interactive Mario face in Super Mario 64 by attaching painted ping-pong balls to his face and using an Indy camera to track movement. His next project, 1080¬∞ Snowboarding, saw him as one of the two lead programmers, alongside fellow Argonaut colleague Collin Reed. This game used frame interpolation and inverse kinematics to make character movement feel more realistic. =Vitei= Afterwards, Goddard left Nintendo and became a freelancer, porting Doshin the Giant from the Nintendo 64DD to the Nintendo GameCube. In 2002, Goddard founded the Japanese video game developer Vitei, Inc., which produced its first game, the Japan-exclusive Nintendo DS title Theta, in 2007, and the WiiWare title Rock N' Roll Climber in 2009, both published by Nintendo. He served as the head programmer for Steel Diver, and Vitei would also develop its sequel, Steel Diver: Sub Wars, as well as Tank Troopers. Vitei is currently developing a virtual reality-focused spiritual successor to 1080¬∞ Snowboarding.

Early life and education Alice Alanna Cashin was born on 6 March 1870 in Melbourne, daughter of boot-maker Richard and Catherine Cashin (n√©e Meehan). Her mother died the following year. The family moved to Sydney, where Cashin was educated at a private ladies college. Her father was later acknowledged as pioneer of IOOF in New South Wales. Cashin completed her nursing training at St Vincent‚Äôs Hospital in Darlinghurst, before working as a private nurse. In July 1901 she joined the Australasian Trained Nurses‚Äô Association. In 1909 Cashin sailed to England to develop her skills in therapeutic massage.  War service  Shortly after the outbreak of World War I she was nursing in France with the British Red Cross. In 1915 she joined Queen Alexandra‚Äôs Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve. She was put in charge of a hospital‚Äôs surgical ward in Ras-el-din, Egypt. While there, she was twice mentioned in dispatches before being awarded the Royal Red Cross in January 1917. In June 1916 she was transferred to HMHS Gloucester Castle where she was matron of the hospital ship. On 30 March 1917 the ship was torpedoed by a German U-boat. Before seeking rescue herself, she ensured that all the wounded soldiers on board as well as the nurses in her charge were transferred from the ship. Only three of the 399 passengers were killed. For this, she was awarded a bar to the Royal Red Cross. Her next posting was two years as matron of the 400-bed Lichfield Military Hospital from 7 May 1917. As well as the fur cape, muff and cap given by Queen Alexandra to all members of the Imperial Military Nursing Service Reserve, Cashin's service was acknowledged by the nursing staff of Lichfield Hospital who presented her with a gold link bracelet, inscribed with her war record.  Post war  In 1924, representing the Diggers, she took part in a competition to raise funds for the Marrickville Anzac Memorial Hall. She was named Queen of Marrickville, receiving 75,346 votes, well ahead of Mrs Cruse (48,186) and Mrs Harris (42,369). She died intestate on 4 November 1939 at her home in Marrickville of chronic nephritis. Her funeral mass was held at St Bridget‚Äôs Catholic Church, before her burial at Woronora cemetery.

She is the Director of the AImage Lab at UNIMORE as well as Director of the Inter-departmental Center of Research in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Enterprise Softech-ICT. Cucchiara is also President of the GIRPR the Italian Association of Pattern Recognition, and her recent collaborations with Panasonic, RAI, and Ferrari focus on GPU based Deep Learning in video understanding for human behavioral analysis and automotive data annotation.  Early life and education  Cucchiara was born in Italy in 1965. She received her Diploma in Classical Studies at Liceo Classico \\"San Carlo\\" in Modena, Italy in 1983 and then pursued her undergraduate education at the University of Bologna. She majored in Electronic Engineering and graduated magna cum laude in 1989. Following her undergraduate degree, Cucchiara pursued her graduate work at the University of Bologna, specializing in Computer Engineering. Her work focused on genetic models for the clustering problem in Image Analysis. Cluster analysis is important for object separation and identification, and is used to transform objects from the real image space to an n-dimensional feature space in order to find similarities between objects and group them. She addressed limitations to existing clustering in image analysis using a stochastic computational model which seeks the optimal solution to an object function. This algorithm is termed the Genetic Algorithm because of its similarity to evolution, where good solutions have higher \\"fitness\\" and are reproduced in order to achieve the most optimal object segmentation. Cucchiara completed her PhD in 1992, and then became a research assistant at the University of Ferrara from 1993 until 1998. Her research here focused on building algorithms for shape and object detection for use in detecting fabrication defects. She used Gradient-based Hough Transform in order to detect shapes amidst both structured and unstructured noise. Cucchiara further developed a novel machine learning approach for features selection and shape detection where data-driven hypotheses are first generated about the presence of a target shape, and then a classifier is defined by a machine learning algorithm validates these hypotheses, such that learning is used both in defining the description language as well as the for defining the model.  Career and research  Cucchiara became an Associate Professor of Computer Architecture and Computer Vision in the \\"Enzo Ferrari\\" Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE) in Italy in 1998. In 2005, she was promoted to Full Professor. Cucchiara has many leadership roles in UNIMORE including being the Dean of Regional Industrial Research, Director of the Inter-departmental Center of Research in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for Enterprise Softech-ICT, and the Director of the Masters Program in Visual Computing and Multimedia Technology. Cucchiara is also Director of the AImage Lab, leading projects in areas such as autonomous robotics, deep learning for video surveillance, human behavioral analysis, and human-car interactions, computer vision and patterns recognition. Outside of UNIMORE, Cucchiara leads several nationwide groups in Italy centered around Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. In 2016, she was elected President of the Italian Association of Pattern Recognition, Learning and Computer vision GIRPR (Gruppo di ricercatori italiani in pattern recognition) and in 2015 she became an advisory board member of the computer vision foundation. She is also Management Director of the new CINI National Lab in Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems. = Human behavior understanding = Human behavior understanding (HBU) is a large focus of Cucchiara's research. This field will be critical to enable proper development of AI tools and to be able to integrate AI seamlessly into society. Further, HBU can be used for crowd surveillance and security. As such, Cucchiara has focused on using multiple camera tracking and supervised clustering to analyze crowds of people. She applied a structural support vector machine classifier learns similarities for groups of people based on inter- and intra- camera feature detection. Using the DukeMTMC-Groups dataset, they completed the first ever experiment to test group tracking within and across cameras. Cucchiara's team has also explored the use of depth cameras to estimate head and shoulder position of humans in images. The core framework of the technique was a Convolutional Neural Network called POSEidon+ which takes 3 images as an input and outputs the 3D pose angles. The model was also able to hallucinate faces from depth images. They tested their algorithm on publicly available datasets and it was able to outcompete existing algorithms, performing at 30 frames per second. Another innovation that Cucchiara and her colleagues have pioneered is the development of a novel algorithm for head pose estimation based on ego- vision from head mounted cameras as interactions and social behavior are related to the perspectives of the individuals in the social interaction. Using supervised clustering and a structural SVM they were able to obtain state-of-the-art head pose and 3D people estimation using first-person videos. = Video surveillance = Cucchiara's develops novel methods and tools for video surveillance, and as such has pioneered the creation of an open platform called ViSOR (Video Surveillance Online Repository) to enable sharing, annotating, and retrieval of videos for surveillance as well as performance of automatic surveillance detection methods. = Adversarial neural networks and hallucination = An interesting extension and recent innovation to Cucchiara's work explores the ability of applying Deep Learning architectures to identify and classify information that is incomplete or missing, such as when a person is occluded by other people or objects in a crowd. Cucchiara and her team were able to integrate U-nets and GANs to develop a novel architecture that is able to impressively \\"hallucinate\\" complete people shapes even when the person is occluded. = COVID-19 social distance tracking through AI = Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Cucchiara has been modifying and applying her innovations to help with pandemic. Cucchiara and her team had previously designed a tool that was able to artificial intelligence to measure the space between people in a crowd for surveillance, but she had now been adapting this tool to measure and enforce social distancing regulations in lines, doorways, and other public spaces. Her project is called \\"Inter-Homines\\", and is uses AI to geometrically verify that citizens are maintaining social distancing measures in public spaces. The technology will generate a warning message when people come within 2.4m of each other. Her work is directly helping to ensure that citizens of Italy, one of the first countries to experience a major outbreak, are continuing to strictly enforce distancing measures as the pandemic continues.

It is produced by comedians Tanmay Bhat, Rohan Joshi, Ashish Shakya and Gursimran Khamba of All India Bakchod under their banner First Draft. Starring Vinay Pathak, Tillotama Shome, Seema Pahwa and Vedant Chibber, the film tells the story of a 6 year old boy named Chintu, stuck in Iraq with his family during Saddam‚Äôs fall in April 2004. The film was screened at the 2019 Jagran Film Festival and was supposed to be screened at the 2018 MAMI Film Festival but was dropped out of it after a sexual harassment allegation against one of its producers, Khamba, during the me too movement. Chintu Ka Birthday was released on ZEE5 on 5 June 2020. Plot The film tells the story of 6-year-old boy named Chintu, stuck in Iraq with family at the times of Saddam‚Äôs fall. It is April 2004. US-led allied forces have been in Iraq for a year now. All Indians have been brought home, so says the Indian government. But there are those who migrated to Iraq illegally, still waiting to find a way out. On the day of this story, one such family prepares to celebrate the 6th birthday of their youngest member, Chintu. Their kind-hearted Iraqi landlord Mehdi lends them a helping hand. They have to deal with a lot of issues like they don't find a cake, the old cranky oven doesn't work, issues with decoration, gifts, etc. However, the family has resolved to celebrate his birthday come what may. Waheed, a school friend of Chintu, smuggles drugs & CDs for American soldier and also Jihadi material. He had earlier given Chintu some of his CDs of Jihadi material as well which his parents don't approve of. Suddenly there is a bomb blast and Mehdi is scared and starts looking out of the house desperately. He requests Chintu's family to hide him, which they approve and he hides in the storeroom. Later, two American soldiers, Louis and Reed enter their home to search for the suspects of the bomb blast. Louis is experienced, while Reed has recently arrived at Iraq. Chintu's father Madan, acts normal and calms the situation. The soldiers are satisfied and about to leave when Mehdi screams because of the rats in the storeroom. The soldier quickly pulls him out and detain both of them. The situation suddenly becomes tense. The soldiers request a convoy to take the detainees, but they are informed that the coast is not clear for the convoy. Later, Waheed and a girl arrive for the birthday party. It turns out that Waheed knows Louis and there is an exchange of banter. Mehdi takes advantage of this distraction & escapes from there. Louis chases him, while Reed stays put. Later the radio contact is lost between the two. Meanwhile, because of this chaos, they forget about the cake and it gets charred in the oven. The family is almost in tears to see the cake however, Madan gives them hope and requests his wife Sudha to make another cake with whatever they have. Sudha then starts making a cake out of cookies. Later, Chintu recalls about the Jihadi CDs Waheed had given him and attempts to hide them before Reed discovers it. However, Reed catches him and gets furious. He thinks that the entire family is aiding terrorists and starts thrashing Madan. Louis arrives and tries to calm down Reed. He tells Madan to not to hide anything from them for the sake of his family. Here, Reed tears down the whole house for any more evidence but, he is left more furious because he is not able to find anything. Louis guesses that Waheed is the culprit by the look on his face but, he waits for Madan to say something. Later Madan gets a call from his father & broken down when his father tells him that despite meeting a very senior politician his efforts to evacuate them from Iraq turned futile. After sometime when things are calm, he strikes a conversation with the soldiers. He tells them that he understands that they are not bad people and are just doing their job, but they should give them 10 minutes to celebrate the birthday and he would calmly come with them. Louis dissuades Madan from becoming a sacrificial lamb and urges him to tell them the truth but Madan still refuses. Both of them finally agree for the birthday party and the family starts gearing up for the cake cutting ceremony. Madan receives a call from Mehdi who warns him not to go with the American soldiers because he would never be able to return but, Madan is unwavering. Chintu's family celebrate a very emotional birthday, while Reed reflects deeply on his actions. As they are about to leave, Reed drops the plan of taking Madan with them and both of them leave. Waheed apologies to Madan and he quickly forgives him.

Williams as well as Ian Dunwoodie both nominated to challenge Louisa Wall for the Labour Party selection for the seat of . The selection was scheduled to be held on 21 March 2020, but was delayed due to a complaint about whether some new party electorate branch members lived in Manurewa and were eligible to vote in the selection process. In May, Wall's partner and lawyer Prue Kapua contacted the national party council, claiming that Williams' application was late, and warned that legal action would be taken if it was not rejected.

There were two separate events, the Grand Gala du Disque Classique for classical music and the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire for popular music. The Grand Gala du Disque was created in 1960, as an evening where Edison Awards would be presented, and a variety of national and international artists would perform. For many years it was the most popular radio and TV show of the year in Holland.  History  The Grand Gala du Disque was organized by the Committee for Collective Gramophone Campaigns (CCGC) as a gala where the Edisons would be presented and an event where a variety of national and international artists would perform. The CCGC was formed in 1960 by the national union of record deals (NVGD) and the national union of record manufacturers and importers (NVGI). The first ceremony took place on October 22, 1960 at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. The first gala lasted a total of 7 hours and featured about 50 acts. The broadcast was a joint venture of TV broadcaster AVRO and the Netherlands' major record companies. The event became the most popular radio and TV show of the year in Holland. The Grand Gala was instrumental in introducing the European market to foreign artist. Gladys Knight & the Pips at Grand Gala du Disque Populaire on March 7, 1969.In the years that followed, the Grand Gala du Disque became a prestigious annual event, booking top performers and presenters. In 1963, Princess Irene attended the Grand Gala du Disque Classique in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw and presented the Edisons to the winners on October 4. That year, Princess Margreit visited the Grand Gala du Disque Populaire at the Kurzall, Scheveningen on October 12. Artists included Wim Kan, Marlene Dietrich, Petula Clark, Freddy Quinn, Corry Brokken, and Anneke Gronloh. The 6th annual gala took place on October 2, 1965. Among artists who attended were the Supremes, the Everly Brothers, Cilla Black, Wanda Jackson, Willeke Alberti, Lucille Starr, and Frans Kok orchestra. The grand old style of the Grand Gala du Disque was deemed old fashioned by the end of the 1960s, as the emphasis in the music business shifted from classical/vocal music to pop and soul. However, the promotional power of the Grand Gala du Disque was evident after the Four Tops appeared in 1968, they subsequently sold 45,000 in album sales. Nancy Wilson, Jimmy Smith, Eugene Cicero, Vikki Carr, Wilson Pickett, Dusty Springfield, Esther & Abi Ofarim, Joan Baez, and Nancy Sinatra were among the performers at the 1968 Grand Gala du Disque Populaire, which was held separately as a TV special before the live event. The 10th annual Grand Gala du Disque Populaire took place at the RAI Congress Center in Amsterdam on March 7, 1969. The lineup of performers were: Nini Rosso, Peggy March, Chet Atkins, Buck Owens, the Sandpipers, Gladys Knight & the Pips, Ike & Tina Turner, Miriam Makeba, the Pentangle, the Moody Blues, Harry Secombe, Rika Zarai, Mireille Mathieu, James Last, Amalia Rodrigues, , and Ann Burton. At the Grand Gala du Disque Classique on October 16, 1970, the Amserdam Concertgebouw Orchestra, under Bernard Haitnk, performed works by Berlioz, Bartok, Mahler, and Richard Strauss. Soloist included Stephen Bishop and Dietrch Fischer-Dieskau. The Grand Gala du Disque Populaire on February 15, 1974, was rebroadcast in other European countries. Performers included the Carpenters, Dobie Gray, Barry White, Love Unlimited, Don McLean, and Bobby Vinton. After the organizers decided to quit sponsoring the galas in 1974, the ceremonies became a much more intimate affair. No Edisons were awarded from 1974 to 1976. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the ceremonies were not televised. During the 1980s, several attempts were made to revive the old Grand Gala format (or a format similar to that of the Academy Awards and Grammy Award ceremonies), but due to lack of interest from record companies, artists, the media, and broadcasters, none of these initiatives proved successful and long-lasting. However, Edisons continue to be awarded annually.

This is the only open-air archeological park in Ukraine, recreated in situ. History The Citadel of the Baturyn Fortress is one of the most important historical values of the city of Baturyn, which was the capital of Ukrainian hetmans in the 17th-18th centuries. Since its construction in the first third of the 17th century. The citadel served as a Polish outpost, and in 1669-1708 ‚Äì the official residence of Hetmans Dem—ñan Ignatovych, Ivan Samoylovych and Ivan Mazepa. Archaeological research conducted on the territory of the Citadel since 1996, allowed to recreate the complex. The purpose of the reproduction is to perpetuate prominent historical figures of Ukraine and the prominent role of the city of Baturyn in the history of Ukraine.Volodymyr Mezentsev, ‚ÄúArchaeological Research of Mazepa‚Äôs Capital Baturyn in 2013-2014‚Äù, Ukrainian Echo (Toronto), vol. 28, no. 26, November 25, 2014, pp. 1-2.Volodymyr Mezentsev, ‚ÄúUpdate: Baturyn Excavations in 2014-2015‚Äù, The Ukrainian Weekly, no. 4, January 24, 2016, pp. 16-17.Volodymyr Mezentsev, ‚ÄúPylyp Orlyk‚Äôs Coat of Arms and Other Archaeological Finds at Baturyn in 2017-2018‚Äù, The Ukrainian Weekly (Parsippany, N.J.), No. 7, February 17, 2019, pp. 10-11, 15. The Citadel of the Baturyn Fortress was rebuilt in 2008. The monuments do not claim to be authentic, they create a generalized architectural and artistic image of the Baturyn castle of the early 18th century. The project of reproduction, engineering arrangement and museumification of the Citadel objects as of 2020 has not been fully implemented. Memorial complex The chain of dramatic events that led to the destruction of Baturyn began in 1700, when a coalition led by the Muscovite state began to compete with the Swedish Empire for dominance in Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. The Ukrainian Cossacks were to help the tsar in his war of aggression. From the very beginning of the war, the Cossacks fought on all fronts and suffered heavy losses. The economy was falling rapidly; Ukraine's human resources were catastrophically depleted, and when the war came to the territory of the Hetmanate. In the autumn of 1708, Hetman Ivan Mazepa dared to make an alliance with the Swedish King Charles XII. In response, Russian Tsar Peter I ordered todestroy the capital Baturyn. On October 30, Peter I ordered Alexander Menshikov to capture the Baturyn fortress. At first, the 20,000-strong Moscow army failed to storm the fortified city. And only after penetrating through a secret raid did the twice-superior forces of the Moscow army gain an advantage and capture the fortress. According to historians, on November 13 (2) in early November 1708 in Baturyn was killed from 13 to 15 thousand people ‚Äì soldiers, civilians (mostly women and children). After looting the city and taking everything they could take out, the victors set fire to Baturyn, the surrounding villages and hamlets. Archaeological excavations have shown the fact that the main fighting during the storming of Baturyn took place in the Citadel and the Fortress. The real events of the past have been silenced for almost three centuries. Only with the years of Ukraine's independence did it become possible to speak and write openly about the tragedy of the Ukrainian land.Martin Dimnik and Volodymyr Mezentsev, ‚ÄúExcavations in Baturyn in 2013‚Äù, Canadio-Byzantina, no. 25, University of Ottawa, January 2014, pp. 9-12.

On the background of the stone cross ‚Äì the bronze crucifix of Jesus Christ ‚Äì a symbol of the crucified and resurrected Baturyn, crucified and resurrected Ukraine. On the other side of the Monument to the Victims of the Baturyn Tragedy of 1708 there is an icon of the Mother of God with the Infant, which is a symbol of Baturyn's heroic defense. The original was found during archeological excavations in the burial of a woman with a split skull ‚Äì a victim of the Baturyn tragedy. The authors of the monument are architect Anatoliy Haidamaka and sculptor Mykola Obeziuk.

The career of Papirius Dionysius is partially documented in an incomplete inscription recovered from Antium. = ILS 1455 It attests several positions he held: prefectus vehiculorum, or director of the public post; of sacerdos confarreationum et diffarreationum, which was responsible for conducting the ancient form of Roman marriage; and as a member the advisory board (consilium principis) to the emperor as legal adviser (centenario consiliario Augusti). Due to the incomplete nature of the text, we cannot be certain of the order or date of these positions, except that they were earlier in his career than the major one he held -- praefectus annonae. It was in this office that he intrigued to bring the downfall of the praetorian prefect Marcus Aurelius Cleander. Dionysius abused his office to artifice an impending famine in Rome by deliberately withholding the grain reserves. This led to a revolt in the Circus Maximus during a horse race, when the crowd was convinced that Cleander was responsible for the lack of food, who then marched to where the emperor Commodus was. To appease the crowd, he had Cleander and his son executed.Cassius Dio, Historia Romana, 72.13 However, Dionysius did not enjoy his success for very long, as the emperor Commodus later ordered his death.Cassius Dio, Historia Romana, 72.14 While some authorities believe he was also prefect or governor of Roman Egypt, it is unclear whether Papirius Dionysius actually held the office: while Guido Bastianini includes Dionysius in his list of prefects, dating his tenure to around 188, in a footnote he admits that his prefecture \\"has not been attested by any papyrological or epigraphic source in Egypt\\", while noting that \\"Dionysius, slandered by Cleander, was dismissed before he even reached Alexandria; see the case of Sutorius Macro, in 38\\".Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 302 and note  References  Further reading  * Hans-Georg Pflaum, Les carri√®res procuratoriennes √©questres sous le Haut- Empire romain I-III (Paris, 1961), No. 181 * Claire Pr√©aux, \\"La Pr√©fecture d' √âgypte de 187 √† 190\\", Chronique d'Egypte 22 (2020), pp. 338-342 * C.

He was the son of French speakers Marie Louise (n√©e Perrod) and Louis Marc Samuel Tardent. After being educated in local schools, Tardent travelled through Eastern Europe and eventually matriculated from Odessa University. He spent time in Galicia, the Ukraine and Bessarabia and learned Polish, German, Russian and Latin. He worked as a language teacher and in 1876 married Hortense Tardent, a distant relative, at the Swiss wine-growing colony in Chabag (present-day Ukraine). Move to Australia Due to political instability and poor health, Tardent and his family immigrated to Australia in 1887. He established a farm and winery at Roma, Queensland, which he ran as a co-operative. He became a naturalised British subject in 1890. Following an economic downturn, in 1897 Tardent took up an appointment as manager of the Westbrook State Farm, an experimental farm near Toowoomba. He was transferred to the Biggenden State Farm in 1898, but resigned in 1901 when the state government objected to his political activities.

Among his published works, he is known for editing the 1994 reference book AIDS in Africa. Mboup is currently the President of L'Institut de Recherche en Sant√©, de Surveillance √âpid√©miologique et de Formations (IRESSEF) in Diamniadio, Senegal.  Education  Mboup earned a PharmD degree from the University of Dakar in 1976 and a MS in Immunology from the Pasteur Institute in 1981. In 1983, he received a PhD in Bacteriology Virology from Universit√© de Tours.  Career  Early career = After completing his PhD, Mboup returned to the University of Dakar's School of Medicine and Pharmacy as a professor of microbiology. Mboup focused his research on Dakar's sex workers and the sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) they contracted. He undertook this research his laboratory at the University of Dakar. = Identifying HIV-2 = Phylogenetic tree of the SIV and HIV viruses, including HIV-2 In 1985, only two years after finishing schooling, Mboup's research of Dakar's sex workers led to a breakthrough discovery of a new type of HIV. Mboup's original collection of blood samples from Senegalese sex workers, when tested by Harvard School of Public Health's Phyllis Kanki, showed a closer relation to Simian Immunodeficiency Virus than the known HIV-1. Mboup subsequently collected new samples from the same women and transported the 30 vials of blood to the United States. Mboup's lab at the time was ill-equipped for further research of the samples and employed only two technicians, so Mboup worked at Professor Max Essex's lab at Harvard University. Mboup's collaboration with his team and Max Essex's team led to the discovery of HIV-2, a serologically different type of HIV. The subsequent study and published report collected samples from 289 sex workers in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. Prior to the release of the study, HIV was not considered widespread in Senegal. Mboup, along with Max Essex, Phyllis Kanki, and a French colleague, presented their identification of a new type of HIV in November 1985 at the International Symposium on African AIDS in Brussels, Belgium. = Collaboration on HIV-2 = Origins  Though Mboup and his team had discovered evidence of a second immunodeficiency virus in 1985, the virus was not yet isolated or known as HIV-2.Clavel F, Gu√©tard D, Brun-V√©zinet F, et al. Isolation of a new human retrovirus from West African patients with AIDS. Science. 1986;233(4761):343‚Äê346. doi:10.1126/science.2425430 After Mboup's 1985 study, a collaboration emerged to further research this new type of virus and its affects. Mboup's team at the University of Dakar along with Harvard University, and two other French universities formed the collaboration. The goal of the institutions working together was to create a research team that was equal in its contributions. Though Mboup's laboratory was not as funded or technically advanced as Harvard University at the time, Mboup emphasized the need for an equal partnership to ensure the collaboration did not become detached from Senegal and West Africa and would instead bring research infrastructure and opportunities to Senegal.  Further understanding of HIV-2  After the initial identification of a new type of HIV, Mboup and his team, along with the newly formed consortium, focused their research in Dakar. The goal of continued research between the collaborators was to understand the nature of this new type of HIV. Mboup and his collaborators focused on researching sex workers in Dakar over time, as this is the initial population HIV-2 had infected. As research capacity grew, Dakar's STD clinics and the sex workers who were treated at the clinics became an avenue for the team to test and track the progression and prevalence of the virus. Over time, the number of subjects involved in the consortium's research grew to include a few thousand women. The success of working at STD clinics and tracking sex workers was made possible by Senegal's laws surrounding sex work. Sex work was legalized in Senegal in 1969 and all sex workers are required to register their profession with the government and receive regular medical check ups and tests for STDs. Mboup's research with his collaborators from 1985 to 1993 led to the conclusion that HIV-2 is less virulent than HIV-1. This study was published in Science, an academic journal, in September 1994. Though Mboup is not attributed as an author of this study, he was a collaborator. Further studies through the collaboration also revealed that HIV-2 is less transmittable than HIV-1 and that women infected with HIV-2 are less likely to contract HIV-1 than those not infected. Mboup's collaboration on HIV studying Senegalese sex workers lasted over 25 years. Data collected during the collaboration not only furthered understanding of HIV, but are also used today to inform research on other infectious diseases in West Africa. = L'Institut de Recherche en Sant√©, de Surveillance √âpid√©miologique et de Formations (IRESSEF) = In 2017, Mboup founded IRESSEF, a public research institution. IRESSEF was founded to provide cutting-edge research and training in Senegal and to position Africans among some of the world's best researchers. The organization conducts epidemiological studies and trainings with the goal of providing accessible healthcare and developing understanding of diseases in Africa. IRESSEF collaborates with the Senegalese government, other institutes and governmental organizations across Africa, and Western institutions. Recent projects include research on HIV, Ebola, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. = Contributions to research infrastructure in Senegal = Over the course of Mboup's work on HIV-2, he prioritized increasing Senegal's research infrastructure and capabilities. In 1985, Mboup's lab only had 2 lab technicians and lacked properly functioning equipment. He was a leader in the research collaboration on HIV between the University of Dakar, Harvard University, and two other French universities. As a leader, he ensured that adequate resources were invested into Senegal's research infrastructure, as Senegal was the location of the collaboration's studies. Throughout the collaboration, Mboup worked closely with Phyllis Kanki, from Harvard University, who helped inform and develop Mboup's and other Senegalese labs' capabilities and methods to cut costs. Eventually, Mboup's lab, the Laboratory of Bacteriology and Virology at Le Dantec Hospital, grew to become one of the most well-equipped diagnostic labs in Africa, with a staff of more than 40 as of 1995. = Affiliations = In addition to his position with Dakar University, Mboup has held positions in numerous organizations throughout his career. Mboup was the Senegalese coordinator for the Inter-University Convention for Research on Human Viruses and Related Diseases. Meetings for this convention occurred in December 1986 and December 1987. Participants included Harvard University, University of Dakar, University of Tours, and University of Limonges.Socialdepartementet, Sweden, Statens bakteriologiska laboratorium (Sweden), Karolinska institutet, and World Health Organization.

Mboup served as a consultant to the World Health Organization in 1987 when he was sent to Benin to conduct epidemiological research on HIV. In 1991, Mboup chaired the Sixth International Conference on AIDS in Africa. This conference consisted of over 2,000 researchers from around Africa and took place in Dakar, Senegal. In 1998, Mboup became the leader of the Senegalese AIDS Care Team at Harvard's AIDS Institute Enhancing Care Initiative. This initiative lasted for 5 years. Mboup oversaw some of Senegal's public policy initiatives to combat HIV and AIDS in the country as the leader of Senegal's AIDS Sentinel Surveillance Programme and Senegal's National AIDS Programme. Mboup has also served as president of the African AIDS' Research Network and is a former representative for Africa on the International AIDS Society's Governing Council.  Armed Forces of Senegal  Mboup attended the Senegalese Military Health Training Academy and eventually rose to the rank of Colonel in the Armed Forces of Senegal. Before his retirement from the Armed Forces, Mboup served in the Civil-Military Alliance Against HIV/AIDS as a coordinator for Africa.

Career She was a photographer who captured many important political and artistic figures in Weimar Berlin, including Kurt Weill, Lotte Lenya, K√§the Kollwitz, Max Liebermann and Albert Einstein. Her Berlin studio was at Clausewitzstrasse 2. Personal life Gerty Simon moved to Berlin after World War One. Her husband (Wilhelm), like her father, was a lawyer. They had one son, Bernard (Bernd), born in 1921. Exile With the arrival of the Nazi Party in power in 1933 life became very difficult for the family. In 1933, her son's school, the Landschulheim Herrlingen (now the Bunce Court School), a progressive boarding school transferred from Southern Germany to Otterden, Kent. Gerty Simon followed. Her husband remained in Berlin, unable to continue as a lawyer and judge, but finding work as a notary. The family was not reunited until 1939, and father and son were both imprisoned as enemy aliens. At 19, Bernard was even sent to an internment camp in Australia (until 1942) despite having lived in the UK for seven years. Simon rapidly re-established her studio in Chelsea, and portrayed many significant individuals there, such as Sir Kenneth Clark, Dame Peggy Ashcroft and Aneurin Bevan. She stopped working as a professional photographer from 1937 for unknown reasons. Her husband died in 1966, Gerty Simon died in 1970. Their son died in 2015 and donated his mother's collection of works to the Wiener Library for the Study of the Holocaust and Genocide in Bloomsbury, London.

Format  As a recreation, Shrek Retold follows the plot of the original film with only some deviations. The main difference between Shrek Retold and the original is in its reinterpretation; as a collaborative effort with over 200 contributors, the art style, voice acting, and music change from scene to scene, often being wildly different from the original. Unlike the original Shrek which is entirely 3D animated, Shrek Retold features 2D and 3D animation, live action, stop motion, and other mediums. The film's contributors include many internet personalities and actors, such as David Liebe Hart, Michael Cusack, Ratboy Genius, Anthony Fantano, and SiIvaGunner.  Production and release  Shrek Retold was produced as collaborative, but segmented effort; director Grant Duffrin split the film into different scenes of varying length, and each scene was recreated by a contributor. In an interview with Quartz, Duffrin stated his love of Shrek was genuine, contrary to the \\"ironic\\" Shrek internet memes of the time. Shortly prior to release, a trailer for the film was uploaded to the 3GI channel which received significant news coverage.

They have two EPs and two demos, with their debut album Visitations from Enceladus being released on 4 May 2020 through Blood Harvest records. In an article for The Quietus, the album was referred to as \\"damn near essential, and proof that this dismal isle has a valid contribution to make to this new wave of progressive death metal\\". History The members of what would become Cryptic Shift began working on writing music together at the beginning of 2010, while they were all in High School. The band was officially formed in 2013 by guitarist Xander Bradley, drummer Ryan Sheperson, vocalist Rob Castle and bassist Hokumu Blitzkreig. The group released their debut demo tape Old Chapel Demos in 2014, however soon after, Castle departed from the group, leading to Bradley taking on the addition role of vocalist, and the hiring of Henry Parker as an additional guitarist. Around this time, the band underwent what Bradley considers a \\"reincarnation\\", where the band began \\"a new focused sound and much improved mindset\\". In 2015, Parker departed from the group, being replaced by John Riley. This line-up recorded the demo tape Beyond The Celestial Demo the same year, followed a few months later by a split EP with Beastial Invasion. On 27 November 2015, their debut single Deathcrusher was released. The track was then included on their debut EP, released on 1 April 2016, titled Beyond the Celestial Realms. On 3 February 2016, they opened for Exodus at Fibbers in York. Parker departed from the group in 2017, succeeded by guitarist Joe Bradley.

Musical style The band have been categorised as death metal, thrash metal, and technical death metal, often incorporating elements of jazz, progressive metal, doom metal, noise music, psychedelic rock and black metal. Dom Lawson for Metal Hammer described them as \\"phenomenal technological astro-death\\". Echoes and Dust writer Joseph Norman said they are \\"progressive without being proggy, without being Opeth\\" and \\"a pitch-perfect balance of death and thrash sensibilities\\". Echoes and Dust writer Joseph Norman referred to them as the \\"most innovative, tech- death-thrash band that the UK has to offer\\" and their debut album as \\"Death metal teams with the tentacled, extra-dimensional monsters of pulp science fiction and space opera, and the weird tales of Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, and Robert Howard\\". In an article for Metal Hammer writer Jonathan Selzer described their debut album as \\"a visionary, fully-realised assault on the senses whose preview tracks released so far have already put the underground‚Äôs knickers in a physics-defying twist\\". Their releases often include overarching lyrical themes and stories about astronomy and outer space with technical musicianship, elaborate song structures and death growls. In an interview for Distorted Sound, vocalist Xander Bradley stated that \\"There‚Äôs sci-fi sound FX, a ton of solos and plasma.

It broadcast from 1985 to 1993, closing due to insufficient financial support from its listeners. After being silent, the KUWL license was then sold to Borealis Broadcasting, which in turn traded it to the University of Alaska Fairbanks to relocate KSUA in exchange for the rights to the 103.9 frequency, which used the KUWL call letters from 1996 to 2006. History KUWL began broadcasting October 10, 1985. It was owned by the Fairbanks Educational Broadcasting Foundation, and its studios were located at the Lighthouse Christian Center on Kniffen Drive; Fairbanks Educational was independent of Lighthouse but shared directors. It was the first station to operate below 100 MHz in Fairbanks; in Alaska, the lower 12 MHz of the FM band, including what in the rest of the United States was the entire noncommercial educational reserved band, was not available for sound broadcasting until 1982, as it had been allocated to other fixed services before the Alaska Public Broadcasting Commission reached a deal to give broadcasting primary status over rural communications uses in that spectrum. KUWL offered listeners contemporary Christian and easy listening music, as well as CNN Radio news. Despite its small size, KUWL showed itself to be on the bleeding edge of radio technology; the station billed itself as just one of five in the United States who had switched to playing out all music from Digital Audio Tape by 1989. The move was made because DAT hardware interfaced with accessible equipment used by blind announcer Mike Nafpliotis, whereas previous tape decks required sight to operate. Throughout its history, KUWL failed to generate sufficient revenues and listener support. As a result, Lighthouse Christian Center paid expenses for seven years, far longer than the two years originally envisioned when the station began broadcasting in 1985. The station went off the air January 15, 1993, and issued one final plea for $70,000 to return to the air. By 1995, Borealis Broadcasting, owners of KFAR and KWLF, had obtained an option to buy the KUWL license. However, because KUWL broadcast in the reserved band, it could not be used to operate a commercial radio station. However, one group had a license that could: KSUA at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, which had operated on a commercial basis from 1984 to a financial collapse in 1993. In August 1995, Borealis and the university struck a license trade. Borealis got the commercial KSUA license; in exchange, the university received the KUWL license at 91.5, a new antenna and transmitter system valued at $26,000, and $10,000 in additional payments‚Äîall extremely valuable in the face of budget cuts. The call signs on 103.9 and 91.5 FM switched on April 26, 1996; the KUWL license is the current home of KSUA, while the 103.9 frequency became a commercial country music station, known as \\"Cool\\".

Varela, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the use of class arbitration proceedings. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit‚Äôs decision and held that arbitration on a classwide basis could not be compelled based on the provision‚Äôs ambiguous language., 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1415 (2019). The Court relied on its previous decision in Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp. which held that class arbitration procedures could not be compelled without indication that the parties to the arbitration had agreed to these procedures..  Background  Although class procedures are not explicitly referenced in the Act, Section 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (‚ÄúFAA‚Äù) grants courts the power to compel arbitration ‚Äúin accordance with the terms of the agreement.‚Äù. Class arbitrations, like class actions, purport to resolve disputes on behalf of a group of claimants..See Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitration, Am. Arb. Ass‚Äôn, (Oct. 8, 2003). In Stolt-Nielsen S.A. v. AnimalFeeds Int'l Corp., the Supreme Court noted that class arbitrations are inherently different than traditional bilateral arbitration because some of the key features of bilateral arbitration, such as efficiency and confidentiality, are no longer guaranteed.Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 686. Given these differences, and that arbitration is based on consent by the parties, the Court held that silence on the issue of class arbitration could not be interpreted to permit the use of class arbitration procedures.Stolt- Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 687. At least one scholar, however, takes the view that concerns over class arbitration are perhaps overstated.. Not only does the Federal Arbitration Act not demand a specific timeline for resolution of arbitration claims but the current practice of publishing arbitration awards suggests that the concern over confidentiality is not exclusive to class arbitration.  Facts  In 2016 Frank Varela, a Lamps Plus Inc. employee, filed a class action lawsuit against the company after a data breach exposed sensitive tax information of approximately 1,300 employees, including Mr. Varela‚Äôs, and led to the filing of a fraudulent federal income tax return on his behalf.Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1413. Lamps Plus moved to compel arbitration based on the employment contract which included an agreement to arbitrate disputes. Although the court granted the request to compel arbitration, it allowed the arbitrator to conduct the arbitration on a classwide basis rather than on an individual basis. Lamps Plus appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, which held that given the ambiguous language of the arbitration provision regarding availability of class arbitration procedures and that California law allowed courts to construe ambiguity against the drafter, the court could compel class arbitration based on Plaintiff‚Äôs interpretation of the provision. According to the Ninth Circuit majority, Stolt-Nielsen was not controlling in this case because ‚Äòsilence‚Äô on the issue of class arbitration meant that the parties in that case had not agreed to class arbitration procedures rather than just failed to include explicit reference in the provision.  Supreme Court  Majority Opinion = The issue in front of the Supreme Court was whether arbitration on a classwide basis could be compelled based on ambiguous language in the arbitration provision.Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1415. Although Plaintiff tried to distinguish its case from Stolt-Nielsen, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that like silence, ambiguity could not support the use of class arbitration procedures. Here, the Court relied heavily on the concerns regarding the fundamental differences between class and bilateral arbitration described in Stolt-Nielsen.. As Chief Justice Roberts noted, class arbitrations not only sacrificed the informality of traditional bilateral arbitration, which led to lower costs and speedier resolution of disputes, but also distinctively affected the rights of absent class members.Lamps Plus, 139 S.Ct. at 1416. Thus, the majority concluded, agreement to such procedures could not be inferred from an ambiguous provision. The Court also rejected the application of the contra proferentem doctrine, which states that ambiguity in a contract provision is to be construed against the drafter, to support the use of class arbitration provisions. It found that application of contra proferentem would be inconsistent with the FAA because it does not attempt to resolve what the intent of the parties actually was. This reasoning highlighted the Court‚Äôs commitment to the policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements, codified in the FAA, in spite of the fact that as Justice Kagan argued in dissent, contra proferentem is a neutral state contract interpretation ruleSee Bookman, at 1159-60. which is not displaced by the FAA.See Lamps Plus, 139 S.Ct. at 1431 (J. Kagan dissenting). =Dissents= Although the dissenting Justices generally supported each other‚Äôs dissenting opinions, each of the four dissenting Justices wrote their own dissent. Justice Ginsburg‚Äôs dissent emphasized what she viewed as the oppressive nature of arbitration clauses that denied employees and consumers the ability to band together.Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1420-21 (J. Ginsburg dissenting). Justice Sotomayor joined this opinion and Part II of Justice Kagan‚Äôs dissent to emphasize that given that the provision was ambiguous, the Court should have applied contra proferentem to resolve the ambiguity.Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1427 (J. Sotomayor dissenting). Although he joined the dissents of Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan in full, Justice Breyer wrote separately regarding the Court‚Äôs lack of jurisdiction to hear the case.Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1422-23 (J. Breyer dissenting).  Significance  The decision in Lamps Plus is the court‚Äôs latest iteration on restricting the availability of class arbitration procedures.. The Court has repeatedly highlighted the inherent differences between class and bilateral arbitrations in AT&T; Mobility LLC v. Concepcion,. Stolt-Nielsen,Stolt-Nielsen, 559 U.S. at 684-85. and in Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis,, 138 S. Ct. 1612, 1640 (2018). as well as upheld class arbitration waivers in AT&T; Mobility LLC v. Concepcion.AT&T;, 563 U.S. at 352. Given the Court‚Äôs emphasis on the consensual nature of arbitration in this case and in Stolt-Nielsen, there is now a presumption against the use of class arbitration absent explicit reference.See DiLeo, at 178.

The Pazooka Emirate was governed by Xalid Bey and was an ally to the Safavid Ismail I. As Xalid Bey lost a hand in the war, he was called ‚Äúthe only Xalid‚Äù. Due to his heroism in the wars, a hand made from gold was made by Ismail I. Xalid Bey, who had a sermon and coined money on his behalf in the Pazuki region (today Nakhichevan), had to present his loyalty to the Ottomans after a he separated his ways with his Safavid dynasty. Although he supported the Ottoman Sultan Selim I against Shah Ismail I in the Battle of Chaldiran and fought against him, his killing upon order of the sultan after the war, turned the loyalty of the principality back to the Safavids. After Xalid Beys death, his was succeeded by his son Uveys Bey, pledged his loyalty to the opponents of the Ottomans, namely the Safavids, in order to take revenge. After the oath of loyalty, Erci≈ü, Adilcevaz and Beyazid regions, who remained at the Ottoman border, were given the status of principality and asked to protect the border region.D√ºndar Aydƒ±n (1998), Erzurum Beylerbeyligi and Organization- Foundation and Expansion Period (1535-1566), Ankara: TTK Publications, p. 252. 3 Hƒ±nƒ±s Livasƒ± Mufass However, the attempt to take control of the Kurds in the region and efforts to expand the area of sovereignty disturbed the governor of Tabriz and thus the Safavid administration, so the Shah wanted to prevent the strengthening of the Kurds in the region by sending the governor of Tabriz Musa Sultan to the Pazuki Emirate.Izady, Mehrdad. The Kurds and Kurdƒ±stan: A Concise Handbook. Washington: Crane Russak. p. 87. . OCLC 25409394. Uveys Bey, who realized that he could not fight against the army that came upon him, had to take refuge in the Ottoman Empire again. The fact that the Pazooka Beys constantly changed their ranks and brought the Kurds together, while ruling independently created problems in the region and also worried the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. So Kanuni sent news to Durzi Davud and asked the Pazooka Emirate to sword his men. Durzi Davud raided the orders and swept Pazooka Bey and his men. However, two children of Uveys Bey managed to get rid of this massacre and took refuge in Zƒ±rƒ±kanlƒ± Ahmed Bey. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Bey and Z√ºlfikar Bey, who survived the massacre of Uveys Bey, grew up in the tribe and took refuge in Safavid ruler Tahmasp I.D√ºndar Aydƒ±n, Erzurum Beylerbeyliƒüi, p. 101, footnote 83. The Shah returned the old lands of the Pazooka principality, who took refuge in them. His son Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Bey became the district's lord and his brother Z√ºlfikar Bey replaced him when he died. However, the period of Z√ºlfikar Bey was short. When he died, he was replaced by Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Bey's son. When he was prevented from being a principal by his mother, Yadigar Bey, one of the tribal leaders, passed the principality. Yadigar Bey developed the Pazooka region in terms of zoning and enabled the people to live in peace and prosperity. The peace and prosperity developed in the region caused immigration. When he died, his son, Niyazi Bey, passed away. Niyazi Bey could not maintain the peaceful environment provided by his father, events occurred during his time, he was arrested by Shah Tahmasp and imprisoned in Alamut Castle when he abused his power possibilities. Second Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Bey was appointed instead of Ziya Bey. With the death of Shah Tahmasp and the replacement of his son Sultan Muhammed, the Pazuki Principality came to an end and in 1587, the Safavids ended the existence of this principality.

The First Congress of Lithuanian Women held in 1907 called for the establishment of the union, but it was not accomplished due to conflicts between Catholic clergy and socialists. The union was officially established in 1922 and initially chaired by Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó. The union was supported by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Peasant Union, opponents of the authoritarian President Antanas Smetona who came to power in 1926. Therefore, it was in opposition to the government-sponsored Lithuanian Women's Council. The union was officially closed on 10 June 1935. Proposed organization in 1907‚Äì1908 The First Congress of Lithuanian Women held in October 1907 in Kaunas (then part of the Russian Empire) resolved to establish the Lithuanian Women's Union which would participate in the international women's movement. After contentious debates between Catholic clergy and socialists, the congress elected a 10-member committee to organize the union. The committee included Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó as chair, Sofija Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and Marija Peƒçkauskaitƒó as vice- chairs, and as secretaries, Celina Leonienƒó and Kotryna Norkytƒó as treasurers, and Joana Griniuvienƒó, Elena Vaitkeviƒçienƒó, and Teklƒó Augustinaviƒçi≈´tƒó as members of the revision sub-committee. Several other women, including Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó and Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó, were selected as candidates in case of any resignations. The committee, particularly Kymantaitƒó-ƒåiurlionienƒó and Pleirytƒó-Puidienƒó, started working on the statute of the planned union by copying the statute of the Russian Union for Women's Equality. In November, the statute was submitted to the Governor-General of Vilna for approval, but it was rejected. The Catholics protested this statute as they wanted to copy examples of organizations of Belgian and German Catholic women, not Russian liberals. After a failed attempt to find a compromise in December 1907, the Catholic camp established the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women in January 1908. The Catholic association was approved by Kovno Governorate. The Tsarist authorities would not approve another women's organization thus effectively preventing the Lithuanian Women's Union from being organized. However, the union continued to function illegally. In 1908, Gabrielƒó Petkeviƒçaitƒó and Julija ≈Ωymantienƒó attended the First All-Russian Women's Congress organized by the League for Women's Equality. In 1911, the liberal members of the women's movement established ≈Ωibutƒó (Violet), a supplement to the Lithuanian weekly Lietuvos ≈´kininkas on the women's issues. However, it was discontinued after eight issues in 1913. The women debated and rejected the idea of establishing a separate women's political party as it would have weakened the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Lithuanian Democratic Party. Organization in 1922‚Äì1935 The Women's Union was officially established only after Lithuania gained independence in 1918. Its establishment was related to the October 1922 elections to the First Seimas of Lithuania. The organizational meeting took place on 17 August 1922 in Kaunas and elected Felicija Bortkeviƒçienƒó as the chair. The meeting resolved to unite women regardless of their profession or social status and foster Lithuanian traditions and Catholic morals. In particular, the union would work on improving education and public health, promote teetotalism, advocate for women's rights, encourage unity and solidarity among women, aid moral and physical education of Lithuanian youth. A month later, the union resolved to unite all progressive women who did not belong to the Association of Lithuanian Catholic Women. However, without financial support from either the government or the political parties (it was otherwise supported by the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania and the Peasant Union), the union could not compete with the much larger and more influential Catholic association. The union established chapters across Lithuania; the first were established in the districts of ≈†ilalƒó, Tauragƒó, Raseiniai, ≈†iauliai, Tel≈°iai, Plungƒó, Ma≈æeikiai, and Alytus. The union established its own column Moters gyvenimas (Life of a Woman) in Lietuvos ≈æinios which regularly published news about its activities. The union became more active in 1926. The union organized several protest meetings against a decision of 3 November 1926 by the Council of Ministers to dismiss wives of government officials if both spouses worked for the government. The union sent a delegation to President Kazys Grinius with demands to cancel the decision. Due to protests, the decision was withdrawn. The union became less active after the December 1926 coup d'√©tat that brought President Antanas Smetona to power. During a general meeting on 25 May 1928, the union was accused of inactivity and inaction. Ona Ma≈°iotienƒó suggested to change the focus from political agitation to cultural work. A new board was elected in December 1928. In late 1929 and early 1930, the union was in opposition to the government-sponsored Lithuanian Women's Council and derailed plans to include at least one woman in the State Council of Lithuania. The union was inactive from 1933 and was officially closed on 10 June 1935.

Amanda caused deadly flooding and landslides across Central America and Mexico in late-May 2020 that killed 40 people. The second tropical cyclone and first named storm of the 2020 Pacific hurricane season, Amanda developed out of a broad area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave, that moved off the coast of Nicaragua on May 26\\\\. The disturbance slowly developed a more well defined circulation and on May 30, and the system was designated as Tropical Depression Two-E. Originally expected not to significantly strengthen, nevertheless it compacted and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Amanda at 09:00 UTC the next day. Three hours later, Amanda made landfall in southeast Guatemala, the first tropical cyclone to make landfall along that nation's Pacific coast since Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010. Once inland, Amanda rapidly weakened and dissipated over the region's rough terrain. However, the system's remnants survived, crossing Central America and Mexico and re-organized into Tropical Storm Cristobal in the Atlantic. Amanda caused torrential rainfall across Guatemala and El Salvador, the latter of which was heavily impacted by the storm. In Guatemala, 1,500 shelters were opened for survivors. In El Salvador, rivers overflowed and swept away buildings, damaging 900 homes and displacing over 1,200 people. This forced temporary movement restrictions put in place for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to be lifted. Impacts from Amanda were also felt in Honduras, where four people were killed. Overall, Amanda resulted in an estimated $200 million in damage and killed 40 people in these three countries. Meteorological history On May 24, the NHC first discussed the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis due to a broad area of low pressure that was forecast to form off the coast of El Salvador and its associated tropical wave. The tropical wave tracked generally westward across the Caribbean Sea for several days: crossing over Panama and entering the Eastern Pacific basin on May 26. At this point, the NHC considered the disturbance to have a high chance of formation over the next 5 days. Low pressure developed within the disturbance a day later, in association with a broad cyclonic circulation that was enhanced by a Central American gyre on May 27. Remaining nearly stationary for several days, the disturbance's circulation slowly grew more well defined. By May 30, the system attained central deep convection over a now closed low-level circulation and was considered sufficiently organized enough to be designated as Tropical Depression Two-E later that same day, remaining embedded within the eastern side of a Central American gyre. The depression slowly intensified to a strength of 30kt (35 mph, 55 km/h) in aid of fairly warm sea surface temperatures, and at the time was considered unlikely to intensify further. However, convective organization continued to improve as the system also became much more compact, and satellite estimates allowed the NHC to upgrade the tropical depression to Tropical Storm Amanda at 09:00 UTC on May 31, the first named storm of the season. Only three hours after being named, at 12:00 UTC, Amanda made landfall in southeastern Guatemala and began to spread heavy rain inland. Amanda rapidly weakened and dissipated over the country later that day. Its remnants continued north, and later regenerated into Tropical Depression Three in the Bay of Campeche in the Atlantic basin, becoming Tropical Storm Cristobal, on June 1 at 21:00 UTC. Preparations and impactGuatemala= The precursor disturbance of Amanda shortly before being declared a tropical depression on May 30 On May 31, Amanda made landfall in Guatemala, only the second tropical cyclone to make landfall on that nation's Pacific coast this century. The last to do so was Tropical Storm Agatha in 2010. The government of Guatemala issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coastline of Guatemala, from the Guatemala‚ÄìMexico border eastward to the El Salvador‚ÄìGuatemala border border. In Guatemala, nearly 1,500 shelters were opened for those affected by the storm. Two people died across the country. =El Salvador= In El Salvador, torrential rainfall caused significant damage along coastal cities in the country as rivers overflowed and swept away buildings. 25% of the country's annual rainfall totals fell in just 70 hours due to Amanda. Rainfall reached in Izalco by the morning of May 31, prior to Amanda's landfall. Amanda killed 27 people in El Salvador, of which at least six died due to flash flooding, and one died from a collapsed home. Seven people remain missing as of June 2. More than 900 homes were damaged across the country and 1,200 families were evacuated to 51 shelters across La Libertad, San Salvador, Sonsonate, and San Vicente. In the capital, San Salvador, 50 houses were destroyed and 23 vehicles fell into a sinkhole. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele declared a 15-day national state of emergency due to the storm. Movement restrictions in place for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic were temporarily lifted to allow people to purchase medicines, while hardware stores were allowed to open with limited capacity so people could purchase equipment for repairs. Around 7,225 people lost their homes and had to be sent to 154 shelters around the country. At least 2,800 hectares of crops were damaged or lost in the country. Additionally, around 30,000 structures were damaged or likely destroyed by flooding and mudslides. Amanda was considered the worst weather disaster to effect El Salvador in 22 years since Hurricane Mitch, in which Amanda caused rainfall accumulations of at least 600 mm (23.62 in) in many parts of the country and Mitch only caused at least 400 mm (15.74 in) in other areas in a longer period of time. Around 336,000 Salvadorans were pushed into severe food insecurity in both rural and urban areas. ACT Alliance promised at least US$75,000 worth of food and other emergency supplies to be supplied to 1,450 households across the country. Damage was estimated at US$200 million (1.75 billion col√≥n).

He is a veteran of the Burma campaign. Hammond came to media attention in May 2020, after walking 14 miles in a week to raise money for coronavirus charities. He took his inspiration from Sir Thomas Moore, popularly known as Captain Tom, a former British Army officer who has similar footsteps in raising funds to support the vulnerable prior to his 100th birthday in April.  Military Service  Hammond joined the Gold Coast Regiment, then part of the Royal West African Frontier Force, on 31 July 1943. He was trained as a machanic, and posted to Takoradi until November, when he was sent to Khulna with the 3rd Battalion, Gold Coast Regiment for further training. The battalion was attached to the 82nd West African Division and served in western Burma (now Myanmar), during which Hammond and his battalion were involved in heavy fighting. During the Allied capture of Kindaungyyi, Hammond developed an eye infection, and was sent to India for treatment, where he would remain until the end of the war. He returned home in December 1945, and was demobilised in January 1946. He is known to be the only survivor to have served in the Gold Coast Regiment.  COVID-19 fundraising initiative  In May 2020, Hammond embarked on a daily walk to raise $600,000 to support frontline workers and vulnerable veterans across Africa by walking two miles in a day for a week. On the final day of his walk, 25 May, Africa Day, he was joined by Iain Walker, High Commissioner of the United Kingdom to Ghana. thumb He was congratulated by Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex in June, and was informed later the same month he was to receive a Commonwealth Points of Light award. He has so far raised over ¬£40,000 to aid veterans and front-line workers.  Achievements and awards  Pandemic walk - 2020 Hammond recently clocked the 14 miles walk in a week to raise funds to support the vulnerable on May 25.

These riddles overlap in significant part with a collection of forty-seven in the Atharvaveda; riddles also appear elsewhere in Vedic texts.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 13‚Äì17.See also J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens: Proeve eener bepaling van het spel-element der cultuur (Haarlem, 1940), pp. 154ff.

F√ºhrer, \\"Sanskrit-R√§thsel\\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen > morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, 39 (1885), 99‚Äì100. Accordingly, riddles are treated in early studies of Sanskrit poetry such as Da·πá·∏çin's seventh- or eighth-century KƒÅvyƒÅdar≈õa, the KƒÅvyƒÅla·πÉkƒÅra of BhƒÅmaha (c. 700), or the fifteenth-century SƒÅhityadarpa·πáa by Vi≈õwanƒÅtha Kaviraja. citing Durga Bhagwat, The Riddle in Indian Life, Lore and Literature (Bombay, 1965), 5-9. Thus, for example, Da·πá·∏çin cites this as an example of a name- riddle (nƒÅmaprahelikƒÅ): \\"A city, five letters, the middle one is a nasal, the ruling lineage of which is an eight-letter word\\" (the answer being KƒÅ√±cƒ´, ruled by the PallavƒÅ·∏• dynasty). Citing KƒÅvyƒÅdar≈õa 3.114. Early narrative literature also sometimes includes riddles. The Mahabharata also portrays riddle-contests and includes riddles accordingly.Annikki Kaivola-Bregenh√∏j, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 11‚Äì12; . For example, this portrays Yaksha Prashna, a series of riddles posed by a nature-spirit (yaksha) to Yudhishthira, and, in the third book, the story of Ashtavakra. Ashtavakra is the son of one Kahoda, who loses a wisdom-contest to Bandin and is drowned in consequence. Though only a boy, Ashtavakra goes to the court of King Janaka to seek revenge on Bandin. On arrival, he is presented with a series of riddles by Janaka, starting with the widespread year-riddle: what has six naves, twelve axles, twenty-four joints, and three hundred and sixty spokes? (The year.) Janaka then asks a mythic riddle about thunder and lightning, and then a series of simpler, paradox- based riddles like 'what does not close its eye when asleep?' Having won Janaka's approval, Ashtavakra goes on to defeat Bandin in a further wisdom- contest, and has Bandin drowned.Ioannis M. Konstantakos, \\"Trial by Riddle: The Testing of the Counsellor and the Contest of Kings in the Legend of Amasis and Bias\\", Classica et Mediaevalia, 55 (2004), 85‚Äì137 (pp. 111‚Äì13). Meanwhile, Baital Pachisi (Tales of a Vetala), originating before the twelfth century CE, features twenty four tales, each culminating in a riddle or similar puzzle. Unusually, the challenge here is for the hero to not solve a riddle.Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 25.  Medieval Indic languages  The first riddle collection in a medieval Indic language is traditionally thought to be by Amir Khusro (1253‚Äì1325), though it is debated whether he actually composed the collection.Annemarie Schimmel, Classical Urdu Literature from the Beginning to IqbƒÅl, A History of Indian Literature, 8 (Harrassowitz: Wiesbaden, 1975), p. 129. If he did, he wrote his riddles in the Indic language he called Hindawi rather than his usual Persian. The collection contains 286 riddles, divided into six groups, \\"apparently on the basis of the structure of the riddle and the structure of the answer\\"; \\"these riddles are 'in the style of the common people', but most scholars believe they were composed by Khusro\\". The riddles are in MƒÅtrika metre; one example is: The emboldened text here indicates a clue woven into the text: it is a pun on nadi (\\"river\\").  Modern riddles  As of the 1970s, folklorists had not undertaken extensive collecting of riddles in India, but in 1974 Ved Prakash Vatuk published a significant collection of metrical folk-riddles from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh.Alan Dundes and Ved Prakash Vatuk, 'Some Characteristic Meters of Hindi Riddle Prosody', Asian Folklore Studies, 33.1 (1974), 85-153. They circulate in both folk and literary forms. Types of Tamil riddles include descriptive, question, rhyming and entertaining riddles. Riddles are mostly found in oral form. The structure resembles folk songs. Most of the riddles are based on the living things and objects around in day- to-day life. A sample riddle is given below.

The garden of 10 and 11 Downing Street is an L-shaped garden 0.5 acres in size behind the official residences of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, 10 and 11 Downing Street in the Whitehall district of the City of Westminster in central London. The garden has been gradually developed over the 20th century under successive Prime Ministers. History The terrace and garden have provided a casual setting for many gatherings of First Lords with foreign dignitaries, Cabinet ministers, guests, and staff. Prime Minister Tony Blair, for example, hosted a farewell reception in 2007 for his staff on the terrace. John Major announced his 1995 resignation as leader of the Conservative Party in the garden. Churchill called his secretaries the \\"garden girls\\" because their offices overlook the garden. It was also the location of the first press conference announcing the Coalition Government between David Cameron's Conservatives and Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats. In September 1941 Winston and Clementine Churchill drank champagne in the garden with five 'young Frenchmen' who had escaped from France in a canoe before arriving in Eastbourne after having spent 30 hours in the English Channel. Blair held a press conference with Bill Clinton in the garden. Press conferences at the White House are frequently held at the White House Rose Garden. It is believed that the similarity of the occasion has given rise to the 'rose garden' nickname which Victoria Summerley, writing in Great Gardens of London feels is \\"inaccurate\\". In 2012 Michael Craig Martin loaned his 2011 sculpture of a large red lightbulb, Bulb, for installation in the garden. Barbara Hepworth's 1968 sculpture Hollow Form with Inner Form is situated in the garden, on loan from the Government Art Collection. The view of the garden from the balcony In October 1929 The Times reported on the retirement after 40 years of Downing Street's head gardener, Harry Simpson. Having originally started as a gardener in St James Park, he had worked in Downing Street under every Prime Minister from William Gladstone to Ramsay Macdonald. The main gardener at Downing Street, Paul Schooling, was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2010s for his 31 years service to the Royal Parks and his work at Downing Street over 26 years during the premierships of five Prime Ministers. In a 1937 article for The Countryman, Neville Chamberlain related that he once spotted a rare leopard moth in the garden, and put a nesting box in the trees, which was later inhabited by a pair of blue tits. Chamberlain was dismayed to find that one of the blue tits's three eggs had later disappeared. An item in The Times diary in 1989 reported that Margaret Thatcher had believed she had heard a nightingale in the garden. The Sun journalist David Kemp recorded the bird who was then identified as a song thrush by the RSPB. The garden cost The Royal Parks ¬£29,137 in half-yearly maintenance in the six months after the 2010 general election. The garden has been used for numerous events honouring various public bodies. A party to mark the 100th anniversary of the Brownies in 2014. Cameron and Barack Obama held a barbecue for military personnel in the garden in 2011. A special edition of the BBC Radio 4 programme Gardeners' Question Time was broadcast from Downing Street in December 2016 and featured an interview with the head gardener of the 10 Downing Street garden. The garden has been opened to the public on six occasions as part of the Open Garden Squares Weekend organised by the London Parks & Gardens Trust. A view of the rear of 10 and 11 Downing Street from the garden Design Roy Strong described the garden as \\"one of London's hidden gems\\". Victoria Summerley, writing in Great Gardens of London felt that the garden \\"would not win any medals for garden design\\" and that the design of the garden was \\"not an exercise in metropolitan chic or horticultral bling\\" but instead reflected the features of an \\"archetypal British back garden\\" including roses, a shaded area, a large lawn and raised vegetable beds. Summerley observed the evolution of the garden's design, noting that in 1964 it featured only a \\"very straightforward boring layout of lawn\\" with a \\"meagre border around the edge\\" as evidenced in a photograph of Harold Wilson's cabinet taken in the garden. The shape of the garden has remained unchanged since its creation. The garden's simple design of largely lawn with mature trees, rose beds and flowering shrubs remained unchanged for several years. The garden behind originally backed on to St James's Park, as evidenced in George Lambert's 1736-1740 painting of the garden in the collection of the Museum of London. The painting depicts two \\"gentlemen in wigs\\", one of whom is believed to be Robert Walpole. Lambert's painting depicts rectilinear borders and a \\"formal grass parterre with small, box-edged beds filled with topiary, flowering plants and dwarf fruit trees\\". In 1736, in the first reference to the garden, it was written that \\"a piece of garden ground...hath been lately made and fitted up at the Charge...of the Crown\\" with \\"a piece of garden ground scituate in his Majestys park of St. James's, & belonging & adjoining to the house now inhabited by the Right Honourable the Chancellour of his Majestys Exchequer\\". Tubs of flowers line the steps from the terrace; around the walls are rose beds with flowering and evergreen shrubs.Jones, p. 180.Seldon, p. 46. (See North elevation of Number 10 with steps leading to the gardenfigure0748-117-a, british-history.ac.uk)British History Online, From: 'Plate 117: No. 10, Downing Street: elevation and general view', Survey of London: volume 14: St Margaret, Westminster, part III: Whitehall II (1931), pp. 117. Date accessed: 21 July 2008. The terrace features lead planters inscribed with '1666' and 'CR' (an abbreviation of 'Carolus Rex'). The bird table in the garden was donated by the BBC children's television programme Blue Peter, an addition to the garden that Strong felt was \\"more appropriate for a between-the-wars semi\\" and \\"wrong for a Georgian townhouse\\". The pond was built by the Wildlife Trust in 2000. The third shell launched in the Provisional Irish Republican Army's mortar attack on Downing Street exploded in the garden, leaving a 1 meter crater. A woodland garden was created around the crater with cherry trees and daphne odora. The rose beds were commissioned by Margaret Thatcher. They were planted with David Austin roses including a rose named for Thatcher herself. A play area for the Cameron's children with a climbing frame and slide was built in the garden during David Cameron's premiership. Roy Strong described the addition of the play area as \\"ghastly\\". Since the advent of the 21st century the design of garden has reflected environmental concerns and features introduced have included a rose walk, box shaped beds and borders and curved paths. These features were introduced under the premiership of Tony Blair. Gordon and Sarah Brown installed a vegetable patch in the garden in 2009 after being prompted by Michelle Obama, who had initiated the White House Vegetable Garden. Obama had visited the Downing Street garden in April 2009 and told Sarah Brown that \\"You know about the White House vegetable garden and you can do one here\\". Produce from the garden was served in the Downing Street staff canteen. The garden contained \\"strawberries, tomatoes, beetroot, parsnips, peppers, chard and courgettes\\" at the time of its public unveiling. The Browns were assisted by their children in planting the garden. Boxes and plants to attract bees and ladybirds were due to be installed at a later date. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Tim Walker noted that Sarah Brown's vegetable garden had become \\"woefully neglected\\" by July 2010 and was told that David and Samantha Cameron \\"had been too pre-occupied to think much about it ‚Äî he with sorting out the economic mess that Gordon Brown had left him, and she with her pregnancy\\". Water for the garden is provided by an underground tank that reuses rainwater, installed in 2009.

She began studying dance at age five, performing with the Russian Opera and Ballet, the Ballet de la Jeunesse Anglaise and the St. James' Ballet and danced in the film The Red Shoes and stage musicals. Woolliams taught at Folkwang School, was appointed ballet mistress of Stuttgart Ballet, founded the John Cranko School with the director John Cranko, was the third artistic director of The Australian Ballet, was dean of dance at Victoria College of Arts, Melbourne and was artistic director of the Vienna State Ballet. Biography Early life = Woolliams was born in the English coastal town of Folkestone, Kent on 3 August 1926. Her father was a Group Captain in the Royal Air Force and her mother was named Mrs Frank Hawker Woolliams. She had one brother and one sister. Woolliams was taken by her mother to a ballet class at 3¬Ω years old but her left foot had an instep. At the age of five, she began studying dance in Jerusalem. Her first teacher had studied under Mary Wigman, before learning classical ballet under Judith Espinosa, Noreen Bush, George Goncharov and Vera Volkova. Woolliams passed every major examination at the Royal Academy of Dance before turning 13. = Early career = At age 16, she made her professional debut in dance. Woolliams joined the Russian Opera and Ballet led by Jay Pomeroy, which was made up of Eastern European expatriates. Adopting the stage name Anne de Mohan, she joined Lydia Kyasht Ballet de la Jeunesse Anglaise the following year, and then danced with the small St James's Ballet, a minor Arts Council England touring group for towns lacking decent theatres, with whom she became assistant ballet mistress. There, Woolliams became friends with Peter Wright, with the duo dancing together in Alan Carter's comedy ballet The Catch. From 1948 on, she danced in the film The Red Shoes as part of a corps de ballet, and in London stage musicals, such as Brigadoon and Paint Your Wagon. However, Woolliams was more interested in teaching off-stage. She taught in Chicago and Florence while still in her 20s, before taking charge of the ballet syllabus at the Folkwang School in Essen, Germany for seven years between 1956 to 1963, serving as ballet mistress and character artist. There, Woolliams met Antony Tudor, who cast her in his Lilac Garden, playing the role of Caroline in the \\"Episode from His Past\\". She performed in Kurt Jooss' The Green Table, and danced in the Folkwang Tanzstudio ensemble. Deciding that she wanted to advance her career, she was invited by John Cranko, the director of Stuttgart Ballet in West Germany who had learnt of Woolliams' ability, invited her to join his institution as ballet mistress responsible for classes and rehearsals in 1963. Woolliams mounted Cranko's ballets in major European cities and choreographed ballets. She danced as Lady Capulet in Romeo and Juliet and Queen Mother in Swan Lake. = Directorial career = In 1964, she and Cranko co-founded the John Cranko School as the first in West Germany to combine general education and ballet tutoring, and she was made Cranko's assistant director by the choreographer five years later. According to John Percival, Cranko's biographer, Woolliams had \\"\\"fierce rows, after which he would say '1 hale her, loathe her\\", and the dancer was assigned the task of informing dancers they were no longer needed. The 1973 death of Cranko saw her, the prima ballerina Marcia Hayd√©e and Cranko's hair Dieter Graefe formed a directorial triumvirate to keep the Stuttgart Ballet together during its tours of London, Japan and Australia. Woolliams became associate director after Cranko's death, and remained at Stuttgart until September 1976 when she was invited to become The Australian Ballet's artistic director, which she accepted. She was The Australian Ballet's third artistic director, and began work at the company on 1 September on a two-year contract, overseeing productions of Cranko's Onegin in December 1976, Don Asker's Monkeys in a Cage as part of a triple bill in March 1977, Eugene Loring's Billy The Kid, along with revivals of The Sleeping Beauty, Sebastian, Giselle, The Merry Widow, Les Patineurs, Serenade and Raymonda (Act 3), Swan Lake. Over the course of the 1977 season, she invited Walter Bourke, Julia Cotton, Paul Saliba and Meryl Tankard to create works for the programmes Ballet ‚Äò77 and Dance Horizons to support young choreographers. In July 1977, Woolliams offered her resignation to the board of The Australian Ballet foundation because her plans and policies caused friction with administrator Peter Bahen from 1976 to 1977. Her contract stipulated Bahen could overrule her in certain circumstances, which she believed could only occur through dialogue with the board. The resignation was not accepted by the board on the condition that a successor could be found to take over her role. She agreed to the terms and left the role in December 1978. That same year, Woolliams' book Ballet Studio was published in English after a German version had been released as Ballettsaal in 1973. In 1978, she was invited to become the new Dean of Dance at Victoria College of Arts, Melbourne. Woolliams allowed dancers who had left The Australian Ballet to practise at the School of Dance at the college on a daily basis. She began a student touring group to represent Australia in overseas youth festivals and domestically, directed Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin for the Victoria State Opera in 1982, and remained associated with The Australian Ballet with revivals of Romeo and Juliet and Swan Lake. Woolliams returned to Europe in 1987. She established the Schweizerische Ballettberufsschule, a vocational ballet school in Z√ºrich, and continued to stage the ballets of Cranko. In 1993, she was appointed artistic director of the Vienna State Ballet, presenting Wright's new production of The Sleeping Beauty. Woolliams eventually became disillusioned with ballet, and retired to Canterbury, Kent in 1995, devoting herself to her lifelong interests of line drawing and painting in her studio. Personal life She married the principal dancer and choreographer Jan Stripling in 1963. There were no children of the marriage. In 1999, Woolliams was diagnosed with cancer of the spine, and died from the disease on 8 July 1999 in Canterbury. On the afternoon of 30 July, a memorial service was held in her honour at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. Personality and legacy According to the press, Woolliams was instrumental in building the Stuttgart Ballet's international reputation, and Nadine Meisner of The Independent noted she was able to get dancer to understand their inner discipline, and was \\"very forthright\\" with a strong personality. Cranko said of her, \\"Miss Woolliams‚Äô teaching has been of inestimable value to the Stuttgart Ballet. She is to be felt everywhere, from our prima ballerina to our kindergarten.‚Äù She won the first John Cranko Medal in 1976, and the 1978 Australian Critics' Award for Dance for her staging of Cranko's Onegin.

The group was led by Major Colin Scott Dafoe, a Canadian-born surgeon, and included two young British sergeants; Frank, a trained operating-room orderly and Chris, an anaesthetist \\"with limited experience\\".Street, p. 79 Code named \\"Toffee\\" the mission left Bari airfield on 12 May 1944. and the trio was parachuted to their destination, the village of ƒåaniƒái, where the Partisans, joined by Captain Wilson the local commander of the British Mission and the British Liaison Officer (BLO), were eagerly waiting.Street, pp. 46-55MacLaren, pp. 151-154  Background  As the Allies continued their advancement in southern Italy, it became logistically easier to assist anti-Axis fighters throughout the Balkans. By this time, Yugoslav Partisans led by Marshall Tito made significant wins and territory gains against both Italian and German war machines. The partisan warfare demanded agility and near-constant movement of troops which made medical provisioning very difficult. At the same time - frostbite, typhoid, scurvy, serious shrapnel and gunshot wounds required surgery, patient isolation and periods of hospitalisation, almost impossible to provide in such a volatile situation and affecting the soldiers' spirit.Deakin, p. 43 British Government eventually approved the sending of RAMC officers to help. One of the first ones in the field was Major Ian Mackenzie (RAMC), an experienced surgeon, who parachuted to Petrovo Polje on 15 August 1943.Deakin, p. 108 Three months later, he was followed by a New Zealand surgeon, Major Lindsey Rogers and his team - Sergeants William (Bill) Gillanders (RAMC) and Ian McGregor (RAF).Rogers, pp. 19-23Williams, p. 161 Dafoe knew Rogers as the two men were posted together in Tunisia in 1943.Street, p. 19 The fate would bring them together again, this time in a small village of Castellana, south of Bari, in April 1944, as both were preparing to go to the Balkans, Rogers for the second stint.Street, p. 45Rogers, pp. 134-141  Arrival  After two failed attempts, caused by the bad weather, Major Dafoe, his assistants and their canisters with supplies finally landed. Once gathered, they were joined by Corporal Ernest Lincoln who took them to the Partisan 3rd Corps HQ in Dukiƒái near Jadar. There they met Captain Wilson's interpreter, a Canadian miner called George Dikliƒá who arrived in April 1943 as part of Operation Hoathley 1.Maclaren, p. 139 The following day Dafoe realised that his carefully selected and packed medical supplies were being opened and distributed by the Partisans before he had a chance to assemble them into a functioning hospital. Furious, he asked to see the Partisan commander and protest. Assisted by Dikliƒá, he was received immediately by the Generals Kosta Naƒë and Jovan Vukotiƒá, as well as their political commissar Vladimir Popoviƒá. The commanders apologised and instructed their Medical Officer, Doctor Moni Levi, to return the supplies. On his return, Dafoe met Mehmed Ramovic \\"Miki\\", a twenty-year-old student Partisan with good command of English, who became his local guide and interpreter.Street, pp. 51-59  The first hospital  Dafoe was assigned to a large field hospital at the nearby village of Mihajloviƒái. Dr Levi took him there and introduced him Dr Ivo Baboselac, the elderly colonel in charge. He saw the wounded partisans malnourished and suffering from avitaminosis, lying on the floor in several peasant huts. He realised that most required urgent surgical attention and noted in his diary: The answer to his outrage was that \\"There is no medical materiel!\\".Street, pp. 68-75 Assisted by the local commissar, Marko Iviƒá, the group prepared their camp and built the tents and the fire pit. They were provided with horses and were able to visit nearby locations, including underground storage and shelter where the patients and nurses would be hidden during the enemy offensives. Dafoe was shocked with \\"the darkness, the damp, the shortage of food and potable water, the dismal sanitary conditions and the mental strain\\".Street, p. 78 There was a lot of work to be done. He instructed Marko to clean up the grounds, dig a latrine and cut a ditch to redirect a small stream that made the place muddy and attracted the wallowing pigs. He and his team, in the meantime, thoroughly cleaned up and disinfected the two operating rooms - floors, walls and ceilings. They started operating immediately after. The hospital by now had 150 beds, and a constant stream of new patients with fresh or long-neglected wounds often in need of amputation. They were joined by Jordana Herlinger \\"Jordy\\", the daughter of a famous surgeon Dr Ivo Herlinger who helped set up the hospital. Her mother Zlatka and sister Mira also came to visit, thanking Dafoe for taking Jordana \\"under his wing\\". Additional staff joined nurses as well as co-ordination commissars, including Milutin ƒêuraskoviƒá \\"ƒêura\\". One day, Ismet Mujezinoviƒá, a famous artist introduced himself. Dafoe was glad that the two man could converse in French. The British medics quickly became well-known and were interviewed by J H C Talbot, a Reuters war correspondent who came to visit them.Street, p. 108 They were also invited to village fetes and gatherings. Here, Dafoe met Pop Savo Saviƒá an Orthodox priest in charge of the nearby Lovnica church, as well as HQ's own priest Pop Bla≈æo Markoviƒá.Street, p. 84-98  New hospital  Dafoe soon realised that the existing hospital was too cramped and dirty and that he would need to build a new one. The group selected a nearby plum orchard in which wooden beams and old parachutes were used to make two well-camouflaged new wards. There was an improvised \\"disinfection centre\\" outside where \\"heads were shaved, dirty clothes put through a disinfector, and patients bathed before being carried away to the orchard\\". One day, a US Flying Fortress crashed nearby. The pilots baled out, and the aircraft was soon stripped of anything useful. Even the surviving Perspex windows were repurposed for the new ward.Street, pp. 96-99 In late-June 1944, Dafoe and the team were visited by Ian McGregor, who left Rogers's mission and was now looking to secure an airfield nearby for the evacuation of wounded to southern Italy.Rogers, p. 99 It was quickly built near the village of Osmaci and Dafoe was told to triage the patients and move those ready to leave accompanied by Dr Baboselac. On the first night, eight DC-3s landed and took around 300 patients, on the second night more wounded fighters were evacuated, together with McGregor who had to continue his work elsewhere in the region. On the third night, three out of six air-planes turned back, but the remaining ones made it, and after much haggling managed to evacuate around 100 wounded, rather than 72 which was the original limit for the three aircraft.Street, pp. 108-119Maclaren, p. 153  Visit to Lovnica and the first shoot-out  One morning, Miki took Dafoe to the old church in Lovnica, which had been damaged by enemy action, and an outbuilding which was turned into a makeshift Partisan hospital. Pop Savo welcomed the visitors to the church and showed them the frescoes, the damaged library and the visitors' book which among others had an entry by King Peter II of Yugoslavia. The priest also introduced his son, Brano Saviƒá, who was a local Partisan commander. The word got around quickly, and the local villagers gathered and started dancing, now joined with Frank and Chris.Street, pp. 129-132 On a warm July day, a courier came over and warned Dafoe that a group of Chetniks was approaching the hospital and that they would need to evacuate. Sure enough, as the packing started and patients were prepared for the move, the enemy gunfire got much closer. Jordy and other nurses picked up the precious medical instruments and run into the hills, while other Partisans carried away the patients in their stretcher-beds to the underground shelter. Some patients were able to hobble away on their own. Dafoe came under fire himself and managed to shoot a few rounds from his Marlin pistol in response. Both Miki and he soon realised that their situation was hopeless and withdrew into the hills. Luckily, a brigade from the 3rd Corps HQ arrived and chased away the Chetniks. The following morning, the ransacked hospital was visited by Vladimir Popoviƒá who promised that it would be returned to function as soon as possible. True enough, Jordy and the nurses restored the site by the end of the day. Sadly, not long after due to enemy action, the whole area had to be abandoned again, and Dafoe and the team had to move into the mountains, leaving her and the patients in the underground shelter.Street, pp. 133-139  On the run  Dafoe was soon getting used to the word \\"Pokret! (Get going!)\\" with which Partisans ordered the move of their troops, civilians, wounded and stockpiles. \\"It was a word that typified the Partisan organisation - always moving, seeking some way by movement out of their difficulties...ready to keep moving, if necessary, until the enemy dropped from exhaustion trying to follow them.\\"Street, p. 143 The following weeks were spent wandering around in the directions of Kladanj and Vlasenica, under frequent enemy fire. Captain Wilson maintained radio-link with Bari and was able to arrange for a few DC-3 drops of food and materiel. Additional people arrived also, including Captain Gerrald Holmes, a new BLO for the Partisan 12th Corps. Sadly, his wireless operator, Corporal Straw died after his parachute got caught on the top of tall spruce. He was buried locally, with the service led by Pop Bla≈æo Markoviƒá, and replaced later by Jeffrey Eden. As they continued to move, bad news came from the old hospital. The underground shelter had been discovered and all the patients and medical staff were mercilessly killed.Street, pp. 144-160 The risks were huge and at one point the column passed so close to the German troops that hey had to move in silence - \\"wrapping the animal's hooves with shreds of clothing\\". Eventually, they were able to circle back towards Mihajloviƒái and visit the site of the ransacked hospital. Frank and Chris went with horses to look for instruments and material that was strewn around but could be salvaged. In the meantime, Dafoe agreed to assist the doctors ƒêorƒëe Dragiƒá and Vlatko Ajzensteter who were running the 38th Division's hospital nearby. After performing some initial operations, dr Dragiƒá invited him to meet the Division commanders - Majors Milos Zekiƒá and Husein Krupiƒá, Captain Zvonko Grakaliƒá and their political commissar Vladimir Roloviƒá. On one of the visits to the 3rd Corps HQ, Dafoe was introduced to their chief wireless operator Salom ≈†uica. The team was then told to move back to ƒåaniƒái, the village they landed in May, sadly now burnt-out and \\"virtually unrecognisable\\".Street, pp. 143-183 Wireless schedules continued and Holmes and Eden reported that \\"the enemy was evidently moving toward the Adriatic\\" - expecting an Allied invasion. On 23 August, huge amount of gunfire and shouts of jubilation could be heard. The news broke that Romania had capitulated and that the Soviet troops are likely to march towards Belgrade. The enemy action continued and Dafoe's team together with the 38th Division and 3rd Corps moved to the high plateau of Milan Mountain.Street, pp. 182-187  Onto Tuzla  The following few weeks were spent on a constant move, meandering between enemy troops and occasionally settling-down in small villages for the night. Medical work continued unabated and the team was told that they were going towards Tuzla. On 13 September, in the village of Tarovo, Dafoe gifted his silk- printed maps to his Partisan hosts, who greatly appreciated the gesture. They were now joined by the 27th Division and 11th Division who fought their way across Bosnia on their push towards Belgrade. After reaching the village of Skugriƒái, they were hoping to arrange an airlift of the wounded from a nearby plateau, but unfortunately, they ended up surrounded with Chetnik and German troops and had to break out once again.Street, pp. 188-222 The City of Tuzla was liberated on 17 September. Doctor Dragiƒá, whose family still lived there, insisted on escorting Dafoe into the city. The doctor was recognised by the local crowds who started gathering around the new arrivals. Finally, they managed to reach his old house, where his mother, wife and son were waiting to greet them. Dafoe and Grakaliƒá spent the night there while looking for a more formal accommodation.Street, pp. 223-228 As the situation stabilised, a new 200-bed hospital has been prepared, and Dafoe was expected to run it. Unfortunately, he was recalled back to Italy and flew out of Osmaci in mid- October. Before he left, Vladimir Popoviƒá presented him with a medal, \\"The Order of Service to the People\\" set against a silver wreath.Street, pp. 229-231  Epilogue  Dafoe had not forgotten his initial shock at the first Partisan field hospital he had seen. Speaking on the CBC on 13 August 1945 he added:Maclaren, pp. 152-153  References  Sources   * * Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II Category:Yugoslavia in World War II Category:Special Operations Executive operations Category:United Kingdom‚ÄìYugoslavia relations ","title":"Mission Dafoe"},{"id":"64128704","text":"Rote Hellstr√∂m (1 April 1908 - 13 November 1995) was a Finnish sailor.

Daughter of the painter Gustav F√ºrst and was the first wife of a German-American painter, and leading exponent of Expressionism, Lyonel Feininger. The F√ºrst family hailed originally from Hungary from where they had migrated to Germany and settled in Frankfurt/Oder. Personal Life In 1900, Clara F√ºrst met Lyonel Feininger in Berlin through her brother Edmund F√ºrst (1874‚Äì1955), who, like Lyonel Feininger had studied at the Berlin Art Academy for several years. They married in 1901, and they had two daughters. In 1905 they separated. The first-born of these daughters was the photographer and artist Eleonore Feininger (born 1901) who began her photographic activities in the studio of Karl Schenker in Berlin. The second daughter was Marianne, born in 1902. Clara Feininger had lived in Berlin-Steglitz, Birkbuschstrasse 6 for about 20 years after 1915. While Edmund F√ºrst and his family emigrated to Palestine in 1934 and Lyonel Feininger, whose Cubism-based art was considered \\"degenerate\\" by the National Socialists, moved to the USA in 1937, Clara Feininger stayed in Berlin. She probably lived off the maintenance payments Lyonel Feininger had to make after the divorce in 1907. Around 1939 she lived temporarily in Sch√∂neiche near Berlin, but returned to Berlin and from 1941 lived in Lichtenrader Beethovenstra√üe 29, subletting with Hildegard and Werner Braun. Transportation & Death Clara was classified as a Geltungsjudin (Jewish by Validity) under the Nazi Party's Nuremburg Laws as her father had been Jewish and her mother was not. The fact that she left the Jewish community in February 1938 did not protect her from further persecution. On January 10, 1944, she was deported to Theresienstadt in the 99th transport to that concentration camp and from there to Auschwitz on October 23, 1944, where she was murdered.

Following his Guru's teachings, he founded a non-profit organization called Shri Ram Chandra Mission in 1945, dedicated and named after his Guru, who also bore the same name as him.  Early Life  Ram Chandra was born on 30th April 1899 in Shahjahanpur, UP, India.. He was born to a well-off family, his father Rai Bahadur Shri Badri Prasad held the position of Honorary Special Magistrate 1st Class. He was not a keen student in school where he studied only up to his matriculation (10 yrs of school). He worked in the local court for thirty-one years and retired as a record keeper. From a very early age, he felt a thirst for Reality. He met his Guru in June 1922 at the age of twenty-three. Incidentally, his guru's name was also Ram Chandra, who lived in Fatehgarh, UP.

He founded and registered a non-profit organization called Shri Ram Chandra Mission in 1945 to teach this new method, which he called Sahaj Marg (a name which was subsequently changed to \\"heartfulness meditation\\"), and he wrote a number of books about it. Literary works * Reality at Dawn (1954) * Efficacy of Raja Yoga in the Light of Sahaj Marg * Commentary on the Ten Maxims of Sahaj Marg (1946) * Towards Infinity (1957) * Sahaj Marg Philosophy (1978) * Voice Real - The First Selection (1970) * Voice Real - The Second Selection * Autobiography of Ram Chandra (Volume 1 and 2) (1974) * Complete Works of RAM CHANDRA - The work of Babuji also compiled into a set of six volumes.

The specific name galeata is derived from Latin and means \\"covered with a helmet\\", in reference to the co-ossified head of this frog. Description The type series consists of three individuals: two adult females measuring and an unsexed specimen measuring in snout‚Äìvent length. The body is robust. The head is depressed and longer than it is wide; the snout is long. The tympanum is distinct, as is the small supratympanic fold. The fingers and toes have small discs; the fingers have no webbing while the toes are partially webbed. Dorsal skin is smooth. The dorsal color pattern consists of longitudinal stripes: two parallel dark- brown dorsal stripes, mottled with cream dots, run from the head to the inguinal region, parallel with one mid-dorsal stripe and a pair of dorsolateral stripes of cream to bronze color. Habitat and conservation The type series was found inside a terrestrial tank bromeliad Hohenbergia vertita. The locality is at above sea level and is characterized by generally shallow and sandy soils and with outcrops almost everywhere. The plant cover represented a mosaic of caatinga, cerrado, and campos rupestres vegetation. As of May 2020, this species has not been included in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

Rolls went on to co-found the Rolls-Royce company in 1906. Opening In June 1903, Lord Montagu's father wrote in his Car Illustrated magazine about Charles Rolls and other old Etonians he was at school with who were involved in the motor trade, despite having no need to work for money. As well as Rolls, they included Claude Watney who had opened a showroom in Wardour Street, selling Panhards and Mercedes motor cars.

There are Silurian and Cenozoic sedimentary rocks on the park's margins. The succession was intensely faulted and folded during the Caledonian Orogeny. The region was uplifted as the North Atlantic Ocean opened during the Cenozoic. The current mountainous landscape arises from repeated glaciations during the Quaternary period. Overview The bedrock geology of Snowdonia is largely formed from a sequence of sedimentary and igneous rocks originating during the early Palaeozoic (the Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian periods, lasting between 541 and 419 million years ago). The Cambrian and Ordovician rocks accumulated largely on the Avalon terrane, a piece of the Earth‚Äôs crust which was involved in the Caledonian Orogeny, a long drawn-out continental collision which resulted in their being intensely faulted and folded and subjected to low-grade metamorphism. Deposition of sedimentary rocks continued in the Snowdonia district through the Silurian period during and after the collision which produced the new continent of Laurussia. During the Cambrian and Ordovician, sandstones and mudstones were laid down within the Welsh Basin, a relatively shallow marginal area of a broader and deeper ocean known as Iapetus, which lay to the north. Variations in water depth over this time, related both to crustal extension and to the growth and decline of a south polar ice-sheet, gave rise to changes in conditions of deposition and hence a varying rock sequence. Volcanic activity began in the Ordovician period as ocean crust was subducted to the northwest of Snowdonia and continued into the early Silurian until continental collision had ceased. The nature of the volcanism and hence the character of both extrusive and intrusive igneous rocks varied over time. Most of Snowdonia is thought to have remained as land during the succeeding few hundred million years before being submerged during the Jurassic period though, with one marginal exception, no rocks dating from the Devonian onwards remain. Cardigan Bay developed as a depositional basin during the Mesozoic and some of those sediments are recorded within Snowdonia‚Äôs boundaries, albeit concealed at depth. Many of the formations and groups recorded within Snowdonia are not laterally extensive and so the full sequence described below is not present in its entirety in any one area. Various authors have applied different names to the rock strata of the area over time to an extent that is potentially confusing. The early Ordovician 'Nant Ffrancon' label for example has enjoyed both formation and group status at different times whereas it is currently classed as a subgroup. Cambrian The oldest rocks present at the surface are of early Cambrian age. They are exposed primarily across the Harlech Dome and along the national park's northwestern boundary. A series of different lithologies, all assigned to the Harlech Grits Group are exposed within this structure. The oldest exposed rocks at the core of the dome are the interbedded sandstones and siltstones of the Dolwen Formation, dating from the Comley epoch. They are interpreted as having been laid down within a river delta. These are overlain by the blue and purple siltstones and mudstones of the Llanbedr Formation which are in turn overlaid by the sandstones and conglomerates of the Rhinog (or Rhinog Grits) Formation, interpreted as turbidites accumulating in a series of submarine fans. As the name suggests, these rocks form the craggy peaks of Rhinog Fawr, Rhinog Fach and Y Llethr. Stratigraphically above these are the middle Cambrian age manganese-bearing Hafotty, Barmouth (Grits), Gamlan and Clogau formations, all but the last of which are also assigned to the Harlech Grits. The Clogau Formation, a thickness of black mudstones, together with the late Cambrian age Maentwrog, Ffestiniog Flags and Dolgellau formations are assigned to the Mawddach Group. These too are largely turbidites though the Dolgellau Formation is a dark pyritic mudstone. The exposures of Cambrian age rocks along the park's northwestern boundary differ though the rocks of the lowermost Fachwen Formation can be equated to those of the Dolwen Formation, similarly the Llanberis Slates Formation can be correlated with the rocks of the Llanbedr Formation. The middle Cambrian succession is missing here and the upper Cambrian succession locally comprises the sandstones of the Bronllwyd Grits Formation and the overlying mudstones, siltstones and sandstones of the Marchlyn Formation, correlating with the Ffestiniog Flags. The uppermost part of the Marchlyn, a series of interbedded sandstones and conglomerates, are referred to as the Carnedd y Filiast Grit. An outcrop of this grit at Cwm Graianog displays distinctive ripple-marked bedding on an inclined bedding plane known to rock-climbers as 'Atlantic Slab'. Ordovician Much of the rest of the succession is of Ordovician age, comprising both a thick sedimentary succession together with a range of volcanic rocks. There are also a number of intrusive bodies of Ordovician age. The lowermost Ordovician rocks are the marine mudstones of the Dol-cyn-afon Formation which outcrop around the Harlech Dome. The formation which also includes sandstones and siltstones has been subjected to low-grade metamorphism. Overlying these strata are the shallow marine siltstones of the Nant Ffrancon Subgroup, seen for example in their type area on the south side of Nant Ffrancon but extending from the coast around Penmaenmawr roughly around the edge of the national park to the Tremadog area. They also occur in a broad band around the northern and eastern sides of the Harlech Dome, extending as far east as Llangwm. Intrusive igneous rocks of Ordovician age are plentiful. The dolerites (microgabbro or diabase) are relatively resistant to erosion and so provide outstanding features in the landscape such as the cliffs of Dinas Mot in the Llanberis pass and those of Craig Bwlch-y-moch, Craig y Castell and Craig y Gesail near Tremadog. Silurian Silurian sedimentary rocks, of both Llandovery and Wenlock age, are found along the eastern and southern margins of the park. Bodies of intrusive igneous rocks of Silurian age wrap around the margins of the Harlech Dome and are frequently exposed within the northern mountains. Rocks of the Cwmere, Derwenlas, Cwmsymlog, Devil's Bridge and Borth Mudstones formations occur along the Dovey valley. Younger rocks There are no late Palaeozoic rocks known within Snowdonia nor are there any of Mesozoic or Cenozoic age exposed at the surface. However, the sinking of a borehole at Mochras on the coast south of Harlech revealed a previously unknown succession of Mesozoic and Cenozoic rock strata, hidden by a thick cover of superficial deposits. This concealed succession on the Cardigan Bay coast includes Lower, Middle and Upper Lias from the Jurassic period amounting to the thickest Jurassic rock pile known in Britain. It is unconformably overlain by Middle Oligocene to Lower Miocene age strata (Palaeogene and Neogene periods), all deposited within a half-graben whose eastern edge is the Mochras fault. Quaternary Successive glaciations of Britain's uplands took place within the Quaternary and each one affected Snowdonia. =Devensian glaciation= The main period for which there is evidence of the glaciation of Snowdonia is the Devensian (the name for the last glacial period in Britain). Dozens of glacial cirques were excavated amongst which are those holding the lakes of Llyn Cau and Llyn y Gadair on Cadair Idris, Glaslyn and Llyn du'r Arddu on Snowdon, Cwm Idwal within the Glyder range and those holding Dulyn and Melynllyn lakes in the Carneddau. Major U-shaped valleys or 'glacial troughs' developed at this time include the Nant Ffrancon, Llanberis Pass and Nant Gwynant. Some still host lakes formed within glacially excavated bedrock hollows such as those of Llyn Peris and Llyn Gwynant. Till is widespread though patchy; the largest extents are around Dyffryn Ardudwy and the margins of Carneddau. =Alluvium= There are deposits of alluvium - river laid sand, silt and gravel - along the floors of most of the larger valleys though these are typically narrow and discontinuous in their extent. At their seaward ends they merge with estuarine deposits. =Peat= Peat has accumulated in the post-glacial period though typically in isolated patches within this mountainous landscape. One of the larger deposits is at Waun y Griafolen east of Coed y Brenin. =Landslides= Examples of mass movement are not common in Snowdonia but there is a concentration along the glacially excavated Bala lineament through Talyllyn. The largest is that which originates on the steep northwest slopes of Graig Goch and which has resulted in a mass of debris up to 30m high covering the otherwise flat floor of this trough and behind which is the lake. There are further smaller examples which form Bwlch Cyfyng southwest of Abergynolwyn and on the southeastern slopes of Mynydd Gwerngraig east of Cadair Idris. A further mass of slipped material is recorded beneath the peak of Pen yr Helgi Du at the head of Cwm Eigiau. =Coastal features= There are extensive tracts of 'blown sand' along the coast, particularly forming Morfa Harlech and Morfa Dyffryn. Occurrences of lesser extent are found at Barmouth, immediately north and south of Tywyn and west of Aberdovey. There are also extensive marine deposits inland of the sand dune systems around Tywyn and surrounding Broad Water, an inland widening of the Dysynni. The low ground at Fairbourne is of similar origin, so too at Mochras and at Traeth Bach and inland of Porthmadog. Though not strictly within the national park, offshore and usually submerged beneath the surface waters of Cardigan Bay are several ridges of cobbles and pebbles traditionally associated with legends such as those around Cantre'r Gwaelod but recognised today as medial moraines of glacial origin. Sarn Badrig is the most well-known, running southwest from Mochras. Sarn y Bwch is a similar but smaller feature extending in the same direction from the low headland at Tonfanau, north of Tywyn. The rock debris which forms these two 'sarnau' (Welsh: 'causeways') (and a third to the south) derives from the mountainous hinterland to their east. Structure The area was intensely faulted and folded during the Caledonian Orogeny. Amongst structures from that period are the major lineament-forming Bala Fault / Tal-y-llyn Fault and the Pennal Fault along which the Dovey valley has been carved by water and ice. Numerous other faults ranging from north-south to NE - SW alignments are present throughout the district. Much of northern Snowdonia is characterised by large scale folds, the majority of which have a NE-SW aligned fold axis. Key examples include the Moel Hebog Syncline, Capel Curig Anticline and the Snowdon Syncline; the fold axis passes along the ridge of Bwlch Main and through the summit. Mineralisation There are iron-bearing veins within the Nant Ffrancon mudstones at Tremadog. In the Snowdon area there are occurrences of copper, lead and zinc mineralisation above Glaslyn, on the eastern flanks of Lliwedd and east oy Yr Aran. There are further metalliferous veins east of Beddgelert. These minerals plus gold are known from veins in the Barmouth area. Economic geology The history of mining and quarrying in Snowdonia is a long one. =Metal mining= Copper, gold and iron have been exploited commercially. =Slate= The exploitation of the Cambrian and Ordovician slates began in earnest in the midst of the nineteenth century. Its primary use was for roofing tiles but it is extensively used locally in buildings and in slate fencing. =Other building stone=Conservation Numerous sites and landscapes within Snowdonia are afforded statutory protection for their geological interest. These include SSSIs and RIGS. Interpretation Wales' National Slate Museum was established at Llanberis in 1972 as the North Wales Quarrying Museum. An interpretive facility was developed at Ogwen Cottage in 2013 by the Snowdonia National Park Authority focussing on Darwin's journey through Snowdonia in 1831 and serving as an introduction to the area's geology.

After spending time in Siberian labour camps following his participation in the January Uprising, he began to study the natural history of the Siberian region. Many species of birds and other animals are named after him including Godlewski's bunting. Life and work  Godlewski was born to Alexander and Anna Karolina daughter of J√≥zef Cio≈Çkowski in Boguty Wielkie in the Polish noble clan Gozdawa. After the death of his father in 1848 he moved to work in the Brulino-Koski estate of his cousin J√≥zef Wincenty. He took an interest in hunting and collecting bird specimens and collaborated with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Taczanowski. In 1863, he was punished for taking part in the January Uprising and sent to labour in Siberian mines for 12 years. From 1864, he worked for a while in Pietrowska Mine in Irkutsk. Along with another inmate Alfons Parvex, he studied the Daurian fauna. His sentence ended in 1877 and he managed estates for sometime and then bough some land. After release he began to collaborate with Benedict Dybowski to study the Siberian fauna and flora between 1864 and 1877. Along with Dybowski, they were the first to measure the depth of the Baikal Lake. They collected bird specimens that were used by Taczanowski in his Fauna ornithologique de la Siberie Orientale published in the Journal f√ºr Ornithologie. They were also assisted in the Siberian region by the Polish exile Micha≈Ç Jankowski. By 1890 he bought Smolecha estate near Ostr√≥w Mazowiecki and started a credit banking organizations including a Cooperative Bank. By 1900 he was on the hunting board for Ostrow. He died from typhus at his Smolechy estate and was buried in the Jasienica cemetery. Godlewski was awarded a gold medal in 1870 by the Russian Geographical Society.

A tag index (bottom right) allows topical cross-referencing. A physical zettelkasten The zettelkasten (German: \\"slip box\\") is a knowledge management and note-taking method used in research and study.  Method  A zettelkasten consists of many individual notes with ideas and other short pieces of information that are taken down as they occur or are acquired. The notes are numbered hierarchically, so that new notes may be inserted at the appropriate place, and contain metadata to allow the note- taker to associate notes with each other. For example, notes may contain tags that describe key aspects of the note, and they may reference other notes. The numbering, metadata, format and structure of the notes is subject to variation depending on the specific method employed. Creating and using a zettelkasten is made easier by taking the notes down digitally and using appropriate knowledge management software. But it can be and has long been done on paper using index cards. The method not only allows a researcher to store and retrieve information related to their research, but also intends to enhance creativity. Cross-referencing notes through tags allows the researcher to perceive connections and relationships between individual items of information that may not be apparent in isolation. These emergent aspects of the method make the zettelkasten somewhat similar to a neural network with which one may \\"converse\\".  History  In the form of paper index cards in boxes, the zettelkasten (plural: Zettelk√§sten) has long been used by individual researchers and by organizations to manage information, including notably in the specialized form of the library catalog. It was pioneered by Conrad Gessner (1516‚Äì1565) and was described in detail by Johann Jacob Moser (1701‚Äì1785). The 1794 idyll Leben des Quintus Fixlein by Jean Paul is structured according to the zettelkasten in which the protagonist keeps his autobiography. One researcher famous for his extensive use of the method was the sociologist Niklas Luhmann (1927‚Äì1998). Luhmann built up a zettelkasten of some 90,000 index cards for his research, and credited it for enabling his extraordinarily prolific writing (including over 70 books and 400 scholarly articles). His index cards were digitized and made available online in 2019. Luhmann described the zettelkasten as part of his research into systems theory in the essay \\"Kommunikation mit Zettelk√§sten\\".Luhmann, Niklas. \\"Kommunikation mit Zettelk√§sten.

Kortebaanschaatsen was in that era the most popular sport in Friesland, and became also more and more popular for women. She is named as (one of) the first women speed skater who became notable and popular. She became popular in couple competitions skating together with Jouke Schaap, winning thousand guilders in prize money. Career When Beenen was 16 years old, she started with skating on the ditch where she lived. It was noted by her father that she skated fast. She registered together with her brothers, Hendrik and Jan, for a major competition in Groningen. Beenen won one race after another and was even able to beat the main favorite in the final. She won f 150 and a gold medal. Villager Jouke Schaap (1846-1923)won that day a men‚Äôs competition in Groningen. They agreed to start competing together in couple competitions. They would become one of the best couples and competed about ten years until 1881. They won many prixes; not only in Friesland but also in North Holland, South Holland and Groningen. Especially in their first winter of 1870-71 they won many prizes, among others the second prize in Bolsward, 1st prize in Heerenveen (3 January 1871, f 150) and the first prize in Amsterdam (31 January 1871, f 150). According to her cousin, Beenen would have won that winter an immens amount of money of f 2500. Beenen also won prizes individually. She even competed in the week she was going to marry on 3 February 1880 in Grouw. Also shortly after her marriage on 18 January 1881 in Hardegarijp. That winter of 1880-81 was the last winter she took part in competitions. Popularity Around 1880 a large painting of Beenen and Jouke Schaap (by known painter Janus Poustma) was exposed at a shop window in Gorredijk. On 22 December 1879 her speed skating club \\"Thialf\\" paid big attention to her silver anniversary. In front of the house of the mayor, a large gate was build out of ice blocks. On top where placed three figures: in the middle ice god Thialf and next to him Beenen and Jouke Schaap. A large wooden statue of Beenen en Jouke Schaap was for years at the ice stadium Thialf. 100 year after her career, on 14 December 1974, media paid attention to her career. Personal Beenen was born in Langezwaag. She married on 7 February 1880 with boatman Johannes Sijtzes Krist. It is said that she had a tough marriage, as she stopped with speed skating. They had four children: Bonne, Korneliske, Johanna and Geertje. Bonne drowned in Rotterdam in 1935. Beenen died young on 5 September 1886, aged 33.

They originated together as an organisation aiming to encourage and aid with the formation of immediate care schemes and to provide training to support those working in prehospital care. In 1993, the British Association for Immediate Care began running prehospital care courses in Scotland, which were met with a warm welcome and it became clear there was a large audience for such education, especially in remote and rural areas of Scotland. This need for training and organisational leadership became clearer after the 1994 Scotland RAF Chinook Crash on the Mull of Kintyre. This led to the training provided by BASICS to be modified for a more rural setting, and lead to the development of BASICS Scotland as a separate organisation in 2002. Purpose BASICS Scotland Doctor in the Hebrides, Scotland BASICS Scotland is an association of health care professionals, who undertake additional training as immediate care practitioners. The members provide their services in support of the statutory or voluntary ambulance services. BASICS Scotland in coordination with The Sandpiper Trust is also a keen promoter of first aid and emergency prehospital care. BASICS Scotland responders, many of whom are General Practitioners, are able to offer additional skills and resources to the other statutory and voluntary emergency services. In this role, responders are dispatched by the Scottish Ambulance Service control room, and many responders carry radios or telephones with tracking capabilities to allow control room staff to know when a responder is in close proximity to an incident. These responders are integrated into the pan-Scotland trauma network. Responders who are medical doctors on the General Medical Council register may use emergency Green Beacons on their car to alert other road users intentions (although such lights do not provide exemptions from road traffic law).https://www.rrh.org.au/journal/early_abstract/6114 BASICS Scotland responders have been present at many serious incidents across Scotland for many years, including: * Bus crashes and other traffic collisions * Mountain Rescue incidents  Notable Individuals  Throughout the history of BASICS Scotland there have been a number of individuals, notable for their huge contributions to prehospital care in Scotland. * Prof Colville Laird FIMC (RCSEd) MBE - Founder and later medical director of BASICS Scotland until 2018. He is an expert in prehospital care, particularly in relation to rural Scotland and major incident management. * Mr Dave Bywater - Chairperson and Consultant Paramedic. * Dr Richard Price FRCA FFICM DipIMC (RCSEd) - Clinical Director and Consultant in Anaesthesia and Intensive Care.  The Role the Sandpiper Trust  The Sandpiper Trust is a charity formed to provide remote and rural medical (and paramedical) practitioners with equipment that would allow them to safely provide high quality immediate care at the scene of an illness or accident. The organisation has also supported leaps forwards in prehospital care in Scotland. An early benefit of this organisation was the bespoke design of the Sandpiper Bag specifically for rural prehospital care. The Sandpiper Bag is now the recognised standard pre-hospital care equipment in Scotland and is used extensively on the BASICS Scotland courses. It is also the being used on the prehospital Diploma examinations by the Faculty of Prehospital Care, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Sandpiper Bags have also made their way to Australia with the development of Sandpiper Australia. History BASICS Scotland originally formed as part of the British Association for Immediate Care, which was established in June 1977. Kenneth Easton, a General Practitioner, was the first chairman of the organisation. Since then BASICS Scotland has become fully independent from BASICS and has diversified its educational provision across Scotland. Educational Activity BASICS Scotland provides a number of face-to-face and online courses as well as annual conferences. It also has a voice at national level and direct involvement with the work of the Royal College of Surgeons in relation to their Faculty of Prehospital Care. Training provided by the organisation has also included the use of a simulation vehicle to practice extrication of casualties who have been involved in a car crash. The organisations has also delivered bespoke training courses, to audiences such as dental practitioners, individual GP practices, Occupational Health Doctors and Nurses, Custody Doctors and Immigration Centre Health Practitioners. =Conferences= BASICS Scotland holds annual conferences covering a range of topics of interest to those involved in prehospital and rural emergency care. These conferences are usually held in Aviemore, Scotland. =Courses= BASICS Scotland run a number of courses; *Prehospital Emergency Care Course (PhEC) *PHPLS *GIC *MIMMS *HMIMMS *Tele-Education *Remote Skills *Portfolio Project =Podcasts= The organisation also produce a suite of podcasts, which included various guest speakers form other emergency services, such as Police Scotland and HM Coastguard. These have covered a wide range of topics such as traumatic and paediatric cardiac arrest management, forensic considerations for responders and prehospital analgesia. =Medical Students= BASICS Scotland aims to undertake annual teaching for medical students.

As minister of agriculture in Liberia, she was the first woman to hold such a position in Africa. She has also held several senior posts with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Early career Chenoweth was born in Robertsport, Liberia. She received a BSc. from the University of Liberia in 1967 and earned a Master‚Äôs degree in agricultural economics from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1970. Returning to Liberia she had various jobs in the Ministry of Agriculture until 1977, when she was appointed Liberia‚Äôs minister of agriculture. She was the first woman to serve as a minister of agriculture in Africa and at the time was the only female minister of agriculture anywhere. Attending the biennial FAO Conference for ministers of agriculture at FAO Headquarters in Rome, she encountered difficulties during an official visit by the ministers to the Vatican. She was briefly denied entry, being told by the guards that ‚Äúit is not for wives‚Äù. Departure from Liberia On 14 April 1979, the capital of Liberia, Monrovia experienced significant rioting that left around 40 people dead and US$35 million of property damage. Although the riots appeared to have been politically manipulated, the initial cause was a decision by President William Tolbert, on the advice of Chenoweth, to increase the price of rice. Rice was a major drain on foreign reserves and Chenoweth argued that raising the price would encourage local rice farmers to increase production and promote self‚Äêsufficiency. However, not only was rice a major component of the Liberian urban diet but the President was a major rice farmer and opposition leaders argued that the price was being increased just to benefit him. The rice riots can be seen as a factor leading to the coup d'√©tat one year later when Samuel Doe seized power. Tolbert was killed during the coup on April 12 and 13 members of the Administration, including the deputy minister of agriculture, were executed ten days later. Chenoweth managed to escape and walked her children to safety in Sierra Leone, before they made their way to the United States. After arriving in the United States she worked for the World Bank, first in Zambia and then in Washington, D.C. In 1986 she obtained a PhD in land resources, again from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with a dissertation on ‚ÄúSmall Farmers‚Äô Response to Economic Incentives: A Case Study of Small Farmers in Liberia‚Äù. In 1995 she joined FAO as its representative in The Gambia. Subsequently she opened FAO's first office in South Africa following the end of apartheid. In 2001, she was put in charge of FAO liaison with the United Nations in New York, a post she filled until 2007. Return to Liberia In 2009 Chenoweth began a second term as agriculture minister in Liberia, holding the post until resigning in 2015. In January 2013 she was suspended from office for one month by the President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, following a scandal related to the corrupt issuance of forestry permits. Although not alleged to have personally profited, Chenoweth was accused of having failed to provide proper oversight and due diligence in the issuance of permits. During her tenure she implemented a ‚ÄúBack to the Soil‚Äù campaign in Liberia to empower rural female farmers, which had success in increasing rice and cassava production. Awards * Florence Chenoweth was awarded an Honorary Degree by her alma mater, the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, following a semester-long appointment in 2007 as a distinguished international visitor. The university noted her ‚Äúinspiring activist work to alleviate world hunger‚Äù. She was given a Distinguished Alumni Award by the university in 2005. * The Hunger Project named her as its Africa Prize laureate in 2011 for improving the livelihoods of women farmers.

She serves as Vice Chair for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital. She specialises in the management of HIV/AIDS, health disparities and improving the quality of medical education.  Early life and education  Stone is from Montclair, New Jersey. Stone has said that her early life inspired her career in medicine. As a child she lost her grandmother to metastatic cancer, and as an undergraduate student she lost a cousin to pneumonia caused by HIV/AIDS. Stone was already a successful science student at high school, and decided that she would eventually pursue a degree in medicine. As an undergraduate Stone studied chemical engineering, but whilst she enjoyed the science; she missed the interaction with members of society. Motivated by her grandmother, Stone became focussed on women's health. She completed her medical education at the Yale University School of Medicine. She worked as a DJ throughout her studies and lived in the Harkness dorm. Whilst she was studying medicine, she saw members of her family, classmates and friends get infected with HIV. She has called AIDS the \\"defining disease of [her] generation\\". After graduating in 1984, Stone initially began residency in obstetrics and gynecology, but after internship, switched to internal medicine and completed medicine residency at Case Western Reserve University. As a medical resident, Stone joined the American College of Physicians, and she was board certified in 1988. She earned a Master of Public Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. She later completed a fellowship in infectious diseases at the Boston City Hospital. Her first job was at Boston City Hospital, where she directed ambulatory care services.  Research and career  After completing her training, Stone was appointed to the faculty at Harvard University. At the beginning of Stone's career medicine there were limited treatment pathways for patients suffering from HIV/AIDS. She treated her first HIV/AIDS patient in 1983. In 1996, things dramatically changed, when highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) made it possible to manage AIDS like other chronic illnesses. Her research focussed on why HIV/AIDS was so prevalent amongst Black communities, and how to optimise the care of patients from underserved communities. Whilst working at Harvard, Stone was an active primary care physician and a senior scientist at the Stoeckle Center for Primary Care Innovation at the Massachusetts General Hospital. She was appointed a full Professor of Medicine at Harvard in 2011, and was the first African-American to hold such a position. In 2014, Stone was made Chair of the Department of Medicine at Mount Auburn Hospital, and was named the Charles S. Davidson Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. She moved to the Brigham and Women's Hospital in 2019, where she was made the Vice Chair for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, while continuing her role at Harvard Medical School. Here she also serves on the faculty of the women's leadership program. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Stone used social media to discuss the disproportionate impact of SARS-CoV-2 on communities of colour. In the aftermath of the murder of the unarmed African-American man George Floyd by policemen in Minneapolis, Stone wrote to the faculty of Harvard Medical School to describe the anguish that she felt. = Academic service = Stone was appointed a Fellow of the American College of Physicians in 1996. From 2001 to 2014 Stone directed the primary care residency programme at Massachusetts General Hospital, and used the opportunity to transform the curriculum. As part of this effort Stone created training programmes in cross-cultural care, health policy and women's health. She was elected to the American College of Physicians Board of Regents in 2008, and held this position for over 6 years.

Background and music After releasing his debut album 100% Electronica, George Clanton tried to produce a sequel to it for three years but found it difficult because he wasn't able to find the sound he wanted for it. After giving up, he started experimenting and writing stuff for fun and felt that the \\"songs [were writing] themseves\\". This material became the basis for Slide. Clanton said that Slide was the first album he wrote under his own name, since his debut album was written as a Mirror Kisses record before he decided to release it under his real name. Clanton said that in Slide he did not try to be \\"ironic\\" or \\"silly with his lyrics\\", and preferred to \\"write great pop songs that are representative of an emotion that [he] actually [feels] when [he's] singing them.\\" He has said that a lot of Slide was written \\"freestyle\\" and that the lyrics of it are \\"really vague and come from deep down sometimes from a subconscious place.\\" The album features electric guitars, acoustic drums, samples and synthesizers. Clanton described Slide as \\"a vaporwave opera\\". Clanton premiered Slide on August 18, 2018 in front of a sold out audience at the Elsewhere music venue in Brooklyn, New York City. He also gave a free performance of the album at the Nasher Sculpture Center alongside Chulita Vinyl Club on November 16, 2018. Reception Slide received generally favorable reviews from music critics.

[...] Like Ariel Pink before him, Clanton throws himself into his music without any self-conscious concern for cool‚Äîand throws himself about in breathtakingly physical live shows that bring to mind a young John Maus.\\" John Darr of The Sunflower wrote, \\"While the epic beauty of 100% Electronica is very much intact here, Slide boasts a greater range of arrangements, production choices, and song structures\\" and that it \\"is the work of an artist improving on all fronts.

Anthony Fantano of The Needle Drop praised Slide's sound- craft, describing it as \\"excellent, beautiful, dense, lush, psychedelic, overwhelming, and orgasmic\\", and compared its explosive passion and sonic density with that of New Radicals' and My Bloody Valentine's, respectively. Fantano criticized the singing and the lyrics in the album, describing the latter as \\"an emotional placeholder just to kind of fill space.\\" Clanton disagreed with Fantano on album's lyrics, feeling they are \\"strong\\" and describing himself as \\"extremely proud\\" with them.

Growth imperative is a term in economic theory regarding a possible necessity of economic growth. On the micro level, it describes mechanisms that force firms or consumers (households) to increase revenues or consumption for not to endanger their income. On the macro level, a political growth imperative exists if economic growth is necessary to avoid economic and social instability or to retain democratic legitimacy, so that other political goals such as climate change mitigation or a reduction of inequality are subordinated to growth policies. Current neoclassical, Keynesian and endogenous growth theories do not consider a growth imperative or explicitly deny it, such as Robert Solow. In neoclassical economics, adherence to economic growth would be a question of maximizing utility, an intertemporal decision between current and future consumption (see Keynes‚ÄìRamsey rule). Other sociological and political theories consider several possible causes for pursuing economic growth, for example maximizing profit, social comparison, culture (conformity), or political ideologies, but they do not regard them to be compulsive. Possible growth imperatives are discussed in Marxist theory, Schumpeterian theory of creative destruction and ecological economics, as well as in political debates on post-growth and degrowth. It is disputed whether growth imperative is a meaningful concept altogether, who would be affected by it, and which mechanism would be responsible.  Meaning and definitions  At the macroeconomic or political level, the concept of growth imperatives is used by some authors when there seems to be no acceptable political alternative to economic growth, because insufficient growth would lead to economic and social instability up to \\"severe economic crises\\". The alternative to growth would not be a stable stationary economy, but uncontrolled shrinkage. The consequences of a renunciation of growth would be inacceptable so that growth appears politically without alternative. While some search for purely \\"structural theoretical explanations for the commitment to growth\\", others argue that this macroeconomic phenomenon must be examined at the micro level in line with methodological individualism to explain how and why individual actors (firms, consumers) act and how this interacts with collective structures, and correspondingly study the growth of enterprises with microeconomics and business administration and the increase of consumption using consumption sociology or consumer choice theory. The discussion on growth imperatives is part of a standing debate over the primacy of structure or agency in shaping human behavior. In the social sciences the term social coercion is used when situation-related circumstances or strong social pressure determine the behaviour. According to Marxist theory, a coercion for firms to \\"grow or die\\" is due to economic competition. According to these Marxists, capitalism \\"cannot stand still, but must always be either expanding or contracting\\". Similarly, the environmental economist speaks of a growth imperative for firms only when they are existentially threatened by steadily declining profits and ultimately bankruptcy; in other cases he uses the weaker term growth driver. These definitions can be summarized that a growth imperative exists if exterior conditions make it necessary for agents to increase their economic efforts as to avoid existential consequences.  Microeconomic theories  Firms = Das Kapital by Karl Marx contains the first theory of a growth imperative, which is still disputed today. The first theory of a growth imperative is attributed to Karl Marx. In capitalism, zero growth is not possible, because of the mechanisms of competition and accumulation. Therefore, a company's growth is considered necessary to ensure the survival of the company (\\"grow or die\\"): \\"investment is not an option, or a discretionary decision, it is an imperative that constrains every capitalists' actions and governs the overall economy\\" Correspondingly, some authors argue that the compulsion to grow can only be defused by overcoming structures of market economies, or by pushing back profit-oriented companies that impropriate the surplus value. Other authors criticize this Marxist perspective: a company could be profitable without growth if a positive accounting profit is distributed as dividend to the owners. Only if net income had to be retained, companies would be compelled to grow. If a company shows an accounting profit, it has not yet achieved an economic profit in the economic sense, because a return on equity and an entrepreneurial salary would have to be paid from it - the profit would not necessarily be available for growth. Therefore, a market economy with profit-oriented companies is compatible with zero growth, as it is in the models of neoclassical theory (‚Üí zero-profit condition). The link between technical progress and resource use is disputed On the basis of concepts of evolutionary economics, other authors point out that firms can become dependent on growth as a result of certain economic conditions. Joseph Schumpeter had described the creative destruction in which the existence of firms is endangered if they cannot keep up with the innovation competition. This is interpreted as a need to invest in new technologies and to expand production \\\\- but which investments would be necessary can only be understood in the light of growth theory. Within neoclassical growth accounting it is largely undisputed that only technological change and new combinations of factors of production make sustainable growth of firms and per capita income possible. However, the contribution of single production factors to economic growth has been disputed for decades: While endogenous growth theory concentrates on the role of human capital (ideas, education, innovations), proponents of ecological or environmental economics emphasize the importance of energy consumption as well as raw materials, which are often non-renewable resources (e.g. fossil fuels). While from the human capital perspective no ecologically damaging growth imperative arises, the resource perspective emphasizes that raw material consumption is lucrative for firms because it allows them to substitute expensive labour with cheaper machines. Accordingly, they would constantly invest in new resource-intensive technologies plus the human capital needed for development, which increases resource consumption and compensates advances in energy efficiency (rebound effects). There is also disagreement as to whether these dependencies can be overcome at the company level - provided that this is desired by the owners or the management. Proposals include new management practices, changes in product range, supply chains and distribution channels, as well as the creation of solidarity enterprises, collective enterprises and cooperatives. Other authors call for institutional solutions: reforms of corporate law to overcome the legal constraint of public limited companies to maximise profits, reforms of competition law to prevent externalisation at the expense of common goods, or an institutional limitation of resource consumption and/or increasing their costs through ecotaxes or emissions trading (Cap and Trade), so that technical innovations would put a stronger focus on resource productivity instead of labour productivity. = Private households = Smart phone and car: voluntary consumption or necessary increases of individual productivity? An imperative for private households to increase their income and consumption expenditure is rarely discussed. In neoclassical household theory, households try to maximize their utility, whereby, in contrast to the profit maximization of firms, they are not subject to market imperatives. Therefore, a growth imperative is usually not assumed here, but rather a free decision between current and future consumption. This \\"intertemporal optimization\\" is represented, for example, by the Keynes-Ramsey rule. In consumption sociology various theories of consumer society examine the influence of social norms on consumption decisions. Examples are conspicuous consumption, which was addressed as early as 1899 by Thorstein Veblen in his book The Theory of the Leisure Class, or competition with positional goods, which was described by Fred Hirsch in 1976 in the book Social Limits to Growth. Some authors claim that comparison with others and the unfair distribution of income and power would lead to a growth imperative for consumers: Consumers would have to work and consume more and more in order to achieve a minimum level of social participation, because the economically weak are stigmatised. The reasons given for this behaviour are fear and powerlessness, guilt and shame. However, whether these theories can actually justify a compulsion to increase consumption is disputed, as long as it is not a matter of securing one's livelihood (for example because of unemployment). Another line of argument views certain consumption decisions rather as investments for future growth, but sometimes to increase one's own productivity. Technical products such as vehicles, kitchen appliances or smartphones were used to save time and retain opportunities to earn an income. Over time, these goods would become a necessity, therefore a compulsion to increase one's consumption expenditure could be derived in order to not be left behind technically and economically.  Macroeconomic theories  Political resp. macroeconomic growth imperative = Economic growth is part of goal 8 of the Sustainable Development Goals Economic growth has been formulated as an important economic policy goal for decades. Examples include the \\"growth duty\\" in British legislation, but also the Canadian Jobs and Growth Act, the African Growth and Opportunity Act or the European Stability and Growth Pact of 1997. This has been criticised as politically adhering to a dogma or ideology by some critics of growth. The theory of a political growth imperative, on the other hand, argues that economic growth would be necessary to avoid economic or social instability and to retain democratic legitimacy, or to guarantee national security and international competition. Some authors stress that public finances or social insurance systems such as unemployment insurance or pensions are dependent on growth. Raghuram Rajan sees the cause primarily in political promises that are inherent to social systems. Unemployment, which would occur in the event of technical progress and simultaneous lack of economic growth, is identified as a central problem (Okun's law). Thus, growth above the employment threshold is repeatedly called for in political debates, in order to reduce unemployment. Growth enhancing state investment, but also numerous incentives for private investment would not be simply politician's free will but indispensable to prevent social instability through mass unemployment. This situation would be aggravated by international competition and free trade. As a way out, a redirection of technological development with the help of resource taxes is discussed (ecotax, emissions trading), but also a general reduction of working time to reduce unemployment. At the same time, a more equal distribution of income is demanded, either by fighting the privatisation of economic rents such as land rent or resource rent (‚Üí rentier state), or by calling for an unconditional basic income. = Monetary system and the role of positive interest rates = For a long time, several authors especially from German-speaking countries have been locating a macroeconomic growth imperative in the monetary system, especially due to the combination of credit money and compound interest. This is considered to lead inevitably and system-immanently to an exponential growth of debt and interest-bearing desposits. Some proponents of post-growth would derive a general criticism of positive interest rates from that and support ideas such as demurrage on currency, a concept from Freiwirtschaft, or full-reserve banking. A second line of argument goes back to , his doctoral student Guido Beltrani, and his son . They argue that \\"a portion of money is constantly removed from circulation\\" by banks which is mainly responsible for the growth imperative. In his book The Growth Spiral (2013), Hans Christoph Binswanger estimated a necessary minimum growth rate to be 1.8 %, while Mathias Binswanger (2009) derived a minimum growth rate of 0.45 %, such that enterprises can still generate profits in the aggregate. In his book Der Wachstumszwang (2019), this minimum rate is lowered to zero as to enable firms to accumulate profits. Numerical stability analysis of Stock-Flow consistent models. For certain parameter values (here: interest rate and consumption out of wealth), zero growth is unstable, but stable for others. Other authors criticise the results of Beltrani as well as H. C. and M. Binswanger on the basis that they are based on inconsistent economic models and therefore not valid (‚Üí Stock-Flow consistent model). In different models of a monetary economy there would be either no growth imperative at all or only for certain parameters in the consumption function. They argue that ultimately it is not the interest rate but the savings rate that is decisive for the stability of a stationary economy. If any interest income is consumed in full by the lender, i.e., bank or creditor of the bank, it is available again for repayment. Whether a stationary state can be reached, therefore, depends on the saving decisions of those who earn income or own assets. For zero growth it would only be necessary that savings of some are balanced by consumption out of wealth by others (‚Üí life-cycle hypothesis). The assumption that banks must retain profits even in a non-growing economy would be unfounded. Accordingly, there would be no grow imperative \\"inherent\\" to the monetary system, but zero growth would be impossible as long as actors decide to continuously accumulate financial assets. In neoclassical theory and all varieties that presuppose the neutrality of money (classical dichotomy), the money market has no long-term effects on real economic variables such as economic growth. A monetary growth imperative is already excluded here by assumption. However, post-Keynesian authors who doubt the neutrality of money reject a monetary growth imperative as well.  Political demands to overcome growth imperatives  In September 2018, more than 200 scientists asked the European Union to turn away from any growth imperative ‚Äì a similar demand was raised by the participants of the and the post-growth working group of attac Germany. But even within the post- growth or degrowth movement, the existence of growth imperatives is disputed. Among German parties, the demand was included in the political programmes of the Ecological Democratic Party and Alliance 90/The Greens. Green politicians such as or J√ºrgen Trittin call for overcoming growth imperatives. In a dissenting opinion on the final report of the of the German parliament (Bundestag), the experts Michael M√ºller, , Ulrich Brand, and , as well as the members of the Bundestag and the parliamentary group Die Linke, argued that \\"the question must be answered as to whether progress that is innovative and integrative, socially just and ecologically sustainable is possible without any growth imperative\\".

She was worshipped in the historical regions of Khevsureti and Pshavi in northeastern Georgia. Like the Svan hunting goddess Dali, who is attested in northwestern Georgia, Samdzimari was traditionally depicted as a beautiful blond-haired seductress with dominion over wild spaces. She was the sister-spouse of Giorgi, the Khevsur deity derived from the Christian figure Saint George.  Mythological origins  Samdzimari is one of three daughters of the demonic king of the Kajes, a wealthy race of demons with a supernatural talent for blacksmithing and metalworking who lived in an underworld kingdom called Kajeti. Kajeti is sometimes represented as the land of the dead. Giorgi comes to Kajeti, either by stealth ‚Äì smuggled into the army's stronghold sewn into a horse's skin ‚Äì or by strength ‚Äì accompanied by a group of other divine patrons ‚Äì and conquers the Kaj army. He loots the land of its treasure, metalworking equipment, a one-horned cow, and the king's daughters, and returns to the surface. At a shrine, Samdzimari is made Giorgi's sister-spouse and is thereafter regarded as a deity. Georgian scholar Zurab K'ik'nadze regarded this story as being derived from the Christian story of Saint George and the Dragon, in which Saint George rescues a princess from a dragon and converts her to Christianity. Anthropologist Kevin Tuite disputed that connection to an extent, stating that \\"the symbolic opposition imposed on these personnages [Giorgi and Samdzimari] has no precedent in Orthodox hagiography\\".  Depiction and associations  Samdzimari is generally depicted as a beautiful woman with long blond hair, adorned with gold jewellery and wearing gold slippers. She had the ability to change her shape, and travelled the earth in the form of a mortal woman. She had sexual liaisons with various priests and oracles, often while disguised as women known to them. In some instances, she was said to turn into a wild beast or vanish at the moment of a man's orgasm. In one story, she visits a shrine at Kholiga, and comes across the monk Kholiga Abuletauri. She lives with him as his wife until her mother-in-law discovers her magically shaping a gold ring in a pot of molten butter. She changes back into her true form and flies away. Her liaisons with holy men either symbolize or enhance the oracular powers of these priests, depending on the interpretation. Georges Charachidz√©, a French-Georgian scholar of Caucasian culture, regarded her main function as restorative. Samdzimari would possess a priest who had lost his connection with the gods and thereby restore his connection to the divine. Folklorist Michael Berman regarded her role in these situations as essentially shamanic, serving as an intermediary between the mortal world and the divine. Other scholars have interpreted her intermediary role as a replacement for the religious roles of real women, which were appropriated by male oracles. Samdzimari was regarded as a patroness of marriage, which she is said to have created with Giorgi. She also watches over female activities such as childbirth, foraging for herbs, and milking of cows. Georgian culture drew strong associations between death and dairy livestock, and Samdzimari was entwined with both. Like Samdzimari, cattle were first brought from the underworld to the surface by Giorgi. Both were seen as retaining characteristics of this corrupt origin, which sometimes resurfaced to make them dangerous, as in Samdzimari's grotesque transformations after sexual intercourse. Similarly, dairy products, especially butter, were regarded as life-giving but potentially deadly since they could become spoiled. Butter, sometimes mixed with milk, was often used in funeral rites and other rituals pertaining to the dead. Farmers whose dairy products had spoiled would be advised to make sacrifices to Samdzimari, with her underworld origins, to prevent it from reoccurring. Although she was not primarily a hunting deity, her name was sometimes invoked by hunters for luck, and the horns of deer and ibex were sometimes offered to her after a successful hunt. Because of these associations, Georgian folklorist Mikheil Chikovani considered her to be the northeastern equivalent of the Svan hunting goddess Dali. Like Dali, she was also a patron of untamed spaces: one Khevsur legend describes a shepherdess accidentally encountering Samdzimari in an untouched clearing.  Epithets and etymology  It is believed that her name is derived from the Georgian word mdziv, meaning bead or necklace. Georges Charachidz√© believed that the name Samzdimari was actually a descriptive epithet and not her original name. It was characteristic for central Caucasian cultures to replace sacred words such as the names of divine beings with substitutes; this lexical replacement was driven by taboos against speaking the true words. The Samdzimari Corona on Venus is named for Samdzimari.

Her racing endeavours focused mainly on Grand Prix and rallying. She is the first American woman to compete in an international Grand Prix race. She is the first woman to establish her own Grand Prix team.  Biography  O'Reilly Schell's grandparents had emigrated to the US from Ireland during the Great Potato Famine. Her father was Francis Patrick O‚ÄôReilly, whose construction business and later investments in factories near Reading, Pennsylvania had made him wealthy. In January 1896 Francis married Henriette Celestine Roudet in Brunoy, France. Nine months later Lucy was born in Paris. She would be the couple's only child. Before the outbreak of World War I (WWI), Lucy met Selim Laurence \\"Laury\\" Schell. Schell, who had been born in Geneva and lived mainly in France, was the son of an American diplomat. In the early days of WWI Lucy O'Reilly worked as a nurse, caring for injured servicemen in a Parisian military hospital. In April 1915 she decamped for the United States, accompanied by her mother, Laury Schell, and Schell's brother. Two years later she and Laury Schell returned to Paris to marry. When hostilities ended they took up residence in Paris. The couple had two children. Harry in 1921, and Phillipe in 1926. In the late 1920s O'Reilly Schell began to seriously pursue her interest in motor racing. In 1936 O'Reilly Schell inherited her father's estate, which she used to fund development of racing cars tailored to her requirements. On 18 October 1939 Laury died in a car crash in France. O'Reilly Schell was seriously injured in the same accident. In the early years of WWII, O'Reilly Schell moved her family back to the US. O'Reilly Schell died in Monte Carlo, Monaco. She was initially interred in a cemetery in Monte Carlo, but her remains were later relocated to the family tomb in Brunoy, France, where her husband and eventually both of her sons were also buried. Although she lived much of her life in France, O'Reilly Schell identified as American. Driving career The 1927 Grand Prix de la Baule was O'Reilly Schell's first major race. She finished twelfth in a Bugatti T37A. In 1928 O'Reilly Schell and the Bugatti finished eighth at la Baule, sixth at the Grand Prix de la Marne, and were winners of the Coupe de Bourgogne voiturette race. In 1929 she appeared at la Baule a third time, but was unclassified. In 1929 her attention turned to rallying, when she finished in eighth place at the Monte Carlo rally and won a Coupe des Dames driving a Talbot M 67. She would return to this event several times in the following years in cars of different makes. She finished second once, and third twice, with her husband as co-driver. Throughout the 1930s, O'Reilly Schell raced and rallied a variety of vehicles, including T37A and T44 Bugattis, and an M 67 Talbot. At this time Delahaye was a venerable French automobile maker that had become better known as a builder of trucks than Grandes Routieres. Their cars were called \\"the perfect car to drive in a funeral procession.\\" In 1933 Madame Desmarais, widow of one of the original partners and majority shareholder, decided to take Delahaye racing again. She directed the company's Manager of Operations, Charles Weiffenbach, to establish a racing department. A new chief engineer named Jean Fran√ßois was hired to develop cars suitable for the company's return to competition. The first results were the short wheelbase, four-cylinder 134 and the long wheelbase, six-cylinder 138. In 1933, after the debut of the two new models at the Paris Salon de l'Automobile, Weiffenbach was visited at his office by O'Reilly Schell and her husband. O'Reilly Schell wanted Delahaye to build her a special car by putting the more powerful 3.2 L engine from the 138 in the shorter chassis of the 134. The resulting hybrid was called the Delahaye 135. The Delayahe 135 is the car O'Reilly Schell would be most closely associated with. In subsequent years Delahaye introduced several variations on the theme, including the 135 Sport, 135 Coupe des Alpes, and 135 Comp√©tition. Eventually O'Reilly Schell returned to the company with another request; she wanted a new version of the 135 built specifically for racing. As a demonstration of her determination to see the car built, O'Reilly Schell convinced a dozen like- minded individuals to place orders for the model. The finished product was called the 135 Comp√©tition Sp√©ciale, or 135 CS. Team owner At the end of the 1936 racing season Delahaye dissolved their works racing team. O'Reilly Schell and her husband stepped in to fill the void, effectively becoming Delahaye's factory racing program. The couple had established their own team, called √âcurie Bleue. The goal was to create a racing team that was to France what Scuderia Ferrari was to Italy. To that end, the team's cars were painted French Blue, but of a slightly different shade than that of their compatriots at Talbot. Drawing on her father's estate, O'Reilly Schell underwrote development of a new car commensurate with the team's ambitions. Under Fran√ßois' direction a brand new 4.5 L V12 engine was developed. The car, dubbed the 145 was released in 1936. As it was to play a dual role as both a Grand Prix and sports-racing car, it was bodied as a two-seat car. The team's drivers eventually included Laury Schell, Ren√© Carri√®re, Joseph Paul, Ren√© Dreyfus, Gianfranco Comotti, Ren√© Le B√®gue, and Comte George Rapha√´l B√©thenod de Montbressieux, who raced under the nom de course of \\"Raph\\". =\\"Le Million\\", 1937= Ren√© Dreyfus in Delahaye 145 at Montlh√©ry, 27 August 1937 The mid-1930s Grand Prix racing scene saw the arrival of the German \\"Silver Arrows\\" teams of Mercedes Benz and Auto Union. These two companies received financial support from the German National Socialist government, which promoted German superiority in various endeavours, including auto racing, as a propaganda tool. The rising tide of anti-Semitism had also effectively blackballed driver Ren√© Dreyfus because of his Jewish heritage. To counter the German juggernaut and ongoing competition from the Italian Alfa Romeos, the French government established the \\"Soci√©t√© d'Etude et de Fabrication d'Automobiles de Course\\" (SEFAC) in an attempt to directly develop a new French Grand Prix car for the 750 kg formula. The project's finances were overseen by the \\"Comit√© de la Souscription Nationale pour le Fonds de Course\\". When the SEFAC car proved uncompetitive, and with strong support from the Automobile Club of France among others, the Fonds de Course was repurposed as a prize offered to existing French manufacturers, funded by a surcharge on French drivers license renewals. On 12 April 1937 Bugatti successfully completed the first performance challenges, and was awarded 400,000 FF from the fund. The second performance challenge was called the \\"Grand Prix du Million\\", or simply \\"Le Million\\". This challenge promised a prize of 1,000,000 FF to the French manufacturer and team whose car was able to cover at a speed exceeding by the widest margin at the Montlh√©ry autodrome prior to 1 September 1937. On 27 August 1937, Delahaye 145 serial number 48771, fielded by √âcurie Bleue and driven by Dreyfus, met and exceeded the requirements by the slimmest of margins. Bugatti returned to the track to try to better the Delahaye's time, but were prevented by mechanical breakdowns, and were unable to mount another challenge before the deadline passed. The winnings were split evenly between Delahaye and √âcurie Bleue. Schell in turn gave half of her team's share to Dreyfus. After willing Le Million O'Reilly Schell had a red and white stripe painted diagonally across the cars. Some have suggested that this was the first \\"racing stripe\\". =Grand Prix de Pau, 1938= The first race of the 1938 Grand Prix season was the Pau Grand Prix, a non-Championship event scheduled for 10 April. O'Reilly Schell's √âcurie Bleue fielded two cars and drivers. Dreyfus was to drive the Le Million 145. Teammate Comotti was to pilot another 145 with a revised grille reminiscent of the 135. New Grand Prix rules came into effect in 1938, bringing fresh competition. Mercedes would debut their new W154 at Pau. Drivers for Mercedes were Rudolph Caracciola and Hermann Lang. Alfa Romeo's new Tipo 308 was also expected to appear, fielded this year by Alfa Corse following the breakup of Scuderia Ferrari. Auto Union declined to appear at Pau. During practice the Tipo 308 driven by Tazio Nuvolari caught fire and was withdrawn. As a precaution the other 308 driven by Emilio Villoresi was also withdrawn. In addition, the Mercedes driven by Lang crashed during practice and was rendered unfit to race. Caracciola's W154 suffered with clutch slip and fouled sparkplugs. When the race started, Caracciola took the lead. His W154 developed an estimated , compared to the Delahaye V12's . The twisty road course limited the ability of the Mercedes to use its greater power. Dreyfus was able to keep pace, and even to overtake Caracciola, although he was overtaken again. As the race went on, the track became slippery with oil and rubber, further reducing Caracciola's ability to use the Mercedes' power. The Delahaye had one great advantage; a much lower rate of fuel consumption than the supercharged Mercedes. At the half way point in the race when Caracciola pitted for fuel, he also turned to car over to Lang, the many gear changes having aggravated a previous leg injury. Dreyfus took the lead, and pressed on in what for him had become a non-stop race, having sufficient fuel to cover the remaining distance. Dreyfus finished in first place, beating the W154 by over two minutes. The Caracciola/Lang W154 was second, and Comotti brought the other √âcurie Bleue 145 home in third place. Following the German invasion of France it is rumoured that Hitler issued instructions that the Pau car, chassis 48771, be seized. To prevent the car from being destroyed the Le Million 145 and others were disassembled and hidden. =Grand Prix de l'ACF, 1938= Three of √âcurie Bleue's 145s were registered for the Grand Prix de l'ACF 1938. The driver's were to have been Dreyfus, Comotti and an unnamed third. In February 1938 the French government added another million Francs to the pool to encourage French racing manufacturers. √âcurie Bleue had successfully produced a car that not only won the first million franc prize, but won the Pau Grand Prix against both their formidable German and Italian competition, and won again at Cork against a reduced field. O'Reilly Schell wanted additional funding to finish her next automotive project; the Delahaye 155 single-seater. Instead of the second prize going to Delahaye and √âcurie Bleue, 600,000 FF went to Talbot. Even though their cars were already registered, √âcurie Bleue decided to boycott the French Grand Prix held 3 July 1938. None of their cars or drivers appeared. In 1939 the team purchased two Maserati 8CTF monopostos that were entered in that year's Swiss Grand Prix. O'Reilly Schell moved her team to Monaco shortly afterwards. After the end of the 1939 season, following the death of Laury Schell, the team was renamed √âcurie Lucy O'Reilly Schell. =Indianapolis, 1940= In 1940 √âcurie Lucy O'Reilly Schell entered their two recently acquired Maseratis in the 1940 Indianapolis 500. One year earlier Wilbur Shaw won at Indy in Maserati 8CTF 3032. In May 1940 drivers Dreyfus and Le B√®gue traveled to the US on a ship named the Conte di Savoia. Also traveling with the team was Luigi Chinetti, who was to act as mechanic. Le B√®gue qualified chassis 3030 in thirty-first position. Due to Dreyfus being unaware of Indy's unique rules for qualifying, he did not qualify in chassis 3031. He asked for and was given permission to lap the track again. Dreyfus borrowed 3030 for this run, which broke a connecting rod during the attempt and holed the block. The engine from 3031 was transferred to 3030, and the two drivers shared the car, with Le B√®gue driving the first 250 miles, and Dreyfus the last. Dreyfus and Le B√®gue brought the shared car to a tenth place finish, having completed 192 of the 200 laps. Following the race the cars were sold to Lou Moore, who rebranded them as the Elgin Piston Pin Specials. Both Dreyfus and Chinetti opted to remain in the US after Indy. O'Reilly Schell helped Dreyfus get his US citizenship.

Nzila, Nzila Nzilambi, or Eugene Nzila, is a Zairean scientist and physician at the Department of Public Health in Kinshasa, now known as the Ministry of Public Health (Democratic Republic of the Congo). He played at important role in establishing Project SIDA in Zaire, along with several international scientists. While conducting research, he opened a walk-in clinic and has since produced a lot of research on the HIV virus.  Background  Nzilambi is a Zairean scientist, working mainly in Kinshasa and Zaire. Nzilambi received his education at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, and was later affiliated with the University of Kinshasa. During the late 1990s and 1980s, he focused his research in epidemiology at the Mama Yemo Hospital, now known as Kinshasa General Hospital.  Career  Early Work = He is known to have been the leader on many different research projects, specifically focusing on the HIV/AIDS epidemic, working with several international scientists. In regards to Project SIDA, Nzilambi, as well as other researchers, such as Joseph B. McCormick & Jonathan Mann (WHO official), helped guide the establishment of Project SIDA in Kinshasa. He was one of the whole African scientists in many of his publications, others being Dr. Bosenga N‚Äô Galy and Dr. Pangu Kasa Azila. The team focused on the prevalence of HIV and the risk factors that existed specifically in the area. A popular study with Kevin De Cock and Joseph B. McCormick, consisted of Nzilambi guiding the team in a ten year study, testing blood samples taken in 1976 and 1985. The study mainly established the presence of HIV in rural areas for a period of time, as well as the social issues that may have led to the epidemic. In the late 1980s most of his publications focused on HIV being present in groups of people, including pediatric patients and female prostitutes in Zaire. As a physician in the 1990s, Nzilambi began a walk-in clinic for Zairean prostitutes in order to help and educate them about HIV. He studied the results of their tests, while offering support and care for their health. Later, Nzilambi, along with researchers like Bila Kapita and Peter Piot, attended an international conference in Atlanta. = Post-Project SIDA Work = After Project SIDA dismantled in 1991, Dr. Nzilambi continued his research. Much of it focused on the disease itself, rather than its prevalence in the communities of Zaire. In the late 1990s, it was discovered that Dr. Nzilambi had moved to the United States and was identifying groups of individuals that were not affected by the disease. His most recent work has been dated to the early 2000s. These publications revolve around vaccine and intervention efforts, as well as subtypes of the virus.

It had a conservative orientation and promoted perennial philosophy and the study of archetypes. History Ernst Klett in 1973 The bi-monthly magazine Antaios was initiated by the publisher , who wanted to involve the scholars of the Eranos circle, which held regular conferences mainly focused on religious studies, in a conservative cultural magazine. Role models for Antaios were the Eranos yearbooks, the cultural magazine Merkur and Mircea Eliade's journal Zalmoxis. Eliade, an Eranos regular, was recruited by Klett as an editor. Ernst J√ºnger had been impressed by Zalmoxis and accepted to edit the magazine with Eliade; other people who had been approached but rejected the position included Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell and Karl Jaspers. Klett's nephew Philipp Wolff-Windegg was appointed as editor-in-chief. Although Eliade's and J√ºnger's names were closely associated with the magazine, their involvement as editors was very limited, and it was Wolff-Windegg who handled the selection of writers and articles. The first six issues were published with the subtitle Zeitschrift f√ºr eine freie Welt (\\"Magazine for a free world\\"). In the early existence of the magazine, the circulation was around 3000; toward the end it was around 1200. Due to the failure to increase the readership and Klett's acquisition of Merkur in 1968, Antaios was discontinued in 1971. Contents Each issue was around 100 pages long and mainly consisted of articles on cultural history and essays. There was no narrative prose, although literary sketches sometimes appeared. Characteristic were the priority of perennial philosophy and archetypes over historical-sociological perspectives, and discussions about the West's place in the world, which typically was portrayed as increasingly weak. Many of the texts can be classified as esotericism. Through Eliade, the outlook of the archaic man was a recurring theme, and J√ºnger and his brother Friedrich Georg J√ºnger made a focus point of technology and its issues. It was a stated goal to serve \\"tradition\\", which was said to exist in \\"myth, symbol and poetry [Dichtung]\\", although the term itself was not further specified; it is unclear if it was related to the initiatory \\"Tradition\\" of Julius Evola, who was published in the magazine twice. Contributors from the Eranos circle included Ernst Benz, Hans Kayser, Laurens van der Post and Kathleen Raine. Other contributors included Will Erich Peuckert, Marcel Jouhandeau and Ernesto de Martino. According to the scholar Ulrich van Loyen, the absence of Jewish contributors can be attributed to Klett.

He was king when Agamemnon's daughter Iphigenia was taken to the land of the Taurians, and became a priestess of Artemis there. He was a character in Euripides' play Iphigenia among the Taurians. He is sometimes identified with the Thoas who was the king of Lemnos and the son of Dionysus and Ariadne, and the father of Hypsipyle.Hyginus, Fabulae 120 considers them to be the same; cf. Valerius Flaccus, Argonautica 300-303\\\\. Parada, s.v. Thoas 3 treats them as the same, however Grimal (s.vv. Thoas 1, Thoas 3); Tripp (s.vv. Thoas 1, Thoas 2); and Smith (s.vv.

Iphigenia among the Taurians In Euripides' play, Iphigenia among the Taurians, Iphigenia, after being rescued from her intended sacrifice at Aulis by Artemis, has been brought to the Taurians and their king Thoas, where she is forced to sacrifice any trespassing Greeks to Artemis. As the play begins, Iphigenia's brother Orestes arrives, but he is captured and brought before Iphigenia to be sacrificed. But when the siblings discover each other's identity, they discuss ways to escape. Orestes wants to kill Thoas, but Iphigenia suggests that they trick him. Iphigenia meets with Thoas and claims that because of Orestes' sin of matricide he is polluted and needs to be purified by being washed in the sea. Thoas believes her and allows her to take Orestes to the sea, where they make their escape. A messenger relays this to Thoas and he immediately sends his men to pursue them. Athena intervenes and convinces him to let them go.Gantz, pp. 686-687; Hard, pp. 512-513; Euripides, Iphigenia among the Taurians. Compare with Pausanias, 3.16.7. Hyginus Hyginus tells much the same story as Euripides, but he identifies the Taurian king Thoas with the Lemnian Thoas who was the father of Hypsipyle. Hyginus provides an ending to Thoas' story, saying that the king pursued Orestes and Iphigenia, to the island home of Chryses, the son of Agamemnon and his Trojan war-prize Chryseis. After Chryses discovered that he was the half brother of Orestes and Iphigenia, he killed Thoas.Gantz, p. 687; Hyginus, Fabulae 120, 121.

Avangard was founded on January 20, 1907, by a group of Jewish socialists inspired by the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia. The organization had its office on Mexico 2070, Buenos Aires. History During its early phase there was a Russian-speaking assimilationist faction within Avangard, the iskravets group (named after the Russian publication Iskra). In 1908 the iskravets faction broke away from Avangard and founded their own organization, Tsenter Avangard, which was integrated with the Socialist Party as its Yiddish-language propaganda unit. Avangard and Tsenter Avangard fought over the control of the erstwhile Avangard library. Key figures of the bundist Avangard after the split were Pinie Wald, S. Kaplansky, A. Epshteyn and M. Mas. In August 1908 the group began publishing the monthly Der Avangard ('The Vanguard'). During this the period of 1908-1910 Der Avangard mainly re-published Bundist materials coming from the Bund Foreign Committee in Geneva. Contributors to Der Avangard included M. Olguin, Hersz Libman, A. Litvak, I. Salutzky and D. Pinski. The monthly publishing of Der Avangard was discontinued in December 1909. Der Avangard was again published February-May 1910. In 1910 all the socialist organization in Argentina were forced to suspend their activities under the State of Siege announced during the Argentina Centennial, including Avangard that hibernated for half a year. Avangard sought to organize Jewish workers in trade unions, either in general unions together with Christian workers or in explicitly Jewish unions (such as Jewish unions of bakers and cap makers). The organization struggled against the and the Social Order Law. Politically it was close to the Socialist Party, but the anti-nationalist postures of Avangard caused frictions with the party. The organization also organized Yiddish-language cultural and education activities. In 1912 the library of Avangard merged with the library of the Uni√≥n General de Obreros Israelitas, creating Biblioteca Progreso. Der Avangard resumed publishing in January 1916 (first with S. Kaplansky as its editor and later Pinie Wald), and continued to be published until 1920. During Tragic Week in 1919, the Argentine Patriotic League attacked Avangard and other supposed 'Jewish maximalist' groups. The Avangard library on Ecuador 359 in Buenos Aires was burnt by the mob. Leon (Leibl) Futaievsky, an Avangard member, was killed Pinie Wald was detained. Under torture Wald was forced to confess a supposed plot to install a Soviet regime in Argentina. In 1920 Avangard was divided into two; a communist majority faction and a socialist minority faction. The communist faction aligned with the International Socialist Party in mid-1920, eventually becoming the Jewish section of the Communist Party of Argentina in 1921. The socialist faction of Avangard was refounded as the General Jewish Labour Bund.

From 1930 to 1952, she served as the seventeenth State Librarian of California, the first woman to hold that office.  Early life  Mabel Ray Gillis was born in Sacramento, California, the daughter of James Louis Gillis and Kate Petree Gillis. She attended Mrs. Spillman's school in Sacramento, and earned a teaching certificate from the University of California in 1902.  Career  Gillis began working at the California State Library in 1904, while her father was the State Librarian. In 1917, she was appointed assistant to his successor, Milton J. Ferguson. She became State Librarian when Ferguson resigned in 1930; she was the first woman to be State Librarian of California. She served under five governors, presided over the library's centennial celebration in 1950, and retired from the office in 1952. \\"Under her leadership, the state library has grown from a humble beginning to one of the great libraries of the West,\\" commented governor Earl Warren. \\"I regret to see Miss Gillis retire, but she has earned it.\\" Gillis's professional interests included library services for blind readers. She was head of the state library's Books for the Blind section from its beginning in 1904, and began statewide programs for teaching reading skills to blind readers. As State Librarian, she worked on improving the status and skills of county librarians, with an annual conference and a certification program. She also expanded California's union catalog, allowing local libraries to offer patrons a wider range of titles through interlibrary loans. During World War II, she headed the library's drive to collect books for American servicemen. Gillis was president of the Sacramento Business and Professional Women's Club (1920-1922), and of the California Library Association (1929‚Äì1930), and of the National Association of State Libraries (1935).

In 1988 these units were increased to the size of companies. After the disbanding of the Polish Citizens' Militia and the creation of the modern Police Service, the special police units were named counter-terror companies. In 2000, the counter-terror companies were separated from the existing structures and became directly subordinate to the respective commander of the Voivodeships along with the name change to Independent Counter-terrorism Police Subdivision.https://www.special-ops.pl/leksykon/id269,samodzielne-pododdzialy- antyterrorystyczne-policji Mission and Tasks * High-risk arrests * Counter-terrorism operations * Assistance in police operations with divers * Assistance in rescue operations * Explosive Ordnance Disposal * VIP protection * Hostage rescue Training Due to the hazardous nature of their work, SPAP officers undergo a rigorous selection and training process. Their training includes tactical training, advanced marksmanship and Combatives. Upon completion of their training, further specialization in various fields such as parachuting, altitude rescue, VIP-protection or IED-disposal is possible. During their creation, their training was heavily influenced by American, English, French and Israeli police tactical units.

They are located in Warsaw, Szczecin, Gda≈Ñsk, Bia≈Çystok, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Pozna≈Ñ, Wroc≈Çaw, Katowice, Krak√≥w, and Rzesz√≥w. In larger cities, SPKP units may consist of up to 55 officers each. In smaller voivodship cities, SPAP units consist of approximately 20 policemen. These are located in: Kielce, Radom, Lublin, Gorz√≥w Wielkopolski, Olsztyn, and Bydgoszcz. Depending on the size of the local police units, the SPAP officers operate in their respective units as part-time officers and are only called into their units when needed. In 2017, the police of Poland underwent a process of reorganisation. The existence of BOA KGP as the national unit was maintained. However, the SPAPs units were reorganised and their structure, equipment and logistics were harmonised. The tasks of SPAPs were also specified in detail, adapting the order of the Chief Police Commander to the requirements of the Act on anti-terrorist activities. SPAP has its own bomb-disposal section, in addition one of the sub-units is constantly on duty at the unit in case of operations.

It makes reference to the descent of the Holy Spirit as an invocation to God to come to into the soul of the believer. It is a popular piece of Anglican church music and is commonly sung to the tune by Ralph Vaughan Williams. History The text of \\"Come down, O Love divine\\" originated as an Italian poem, \\"Discendi amor santo\\" by the medival mystic poet Bianco da Siena (1350-1399). The poem appeared in the 1851 collection Laudi Spirituali del Bianco da Siena of Telesforo Bini, and in 1861, the Anglo-Irish clergyman and writer Richard Frederick Littledale translated it into English. The first publication of the English version was in Littledale's 1867 hymn-book, The People's Hymnal. The village of Down Ampney, after which the hymn tune was named For the hymn's publication in The English Hymnal of 1906, the hymnal's editor Ralph Vaughan Williams composed a tune, , which he named after the Gloucestershire village of his birth. This publication established the hymn's widespread popularity. When Vaughan Williams died in 1958, \\"Come Down, O Love Divine\\" was sung at his funeral in Westminster Abbey as the composer's ashes were ceremonially interred in the Musicians' Corner. Text Come down, O Love divine, seek thou this soul of mine, and visit it with thine own ardor glowing; O Comforter, draw near, within my heart appear, and kindle it, thy holy flame bestowing.

At the time of his retirement from racing in 1951, a major media publication for horse racing referred to Loser Weeper as \\"one of Discovery's outstanding sons.\\" Background A foal of 1945, Loser Weeper was bred by Alfred Vanderbilt Jr.'s Sagamore Farm in Reisterstown, Maryland. His sire Discovery was purchased as a three-year-old by Vanderbilt and would earn American Horse of the Year honors for him as well as a place in the U. S. Racing Hall of Fame. Loser Weeper's dam was stakes winner Outdone, a daughter of the 1925 Belmont Futurity winner, Pompey. As a result of his breeding, Loser Weeper is a full brother to Miss Disco, the dam of the very influential National Champion and Hall of Fame sire, Bold Ruler.Through another daughter, Delmarie, Pompey was also the damsire of Count Turf, winner of the 1951 Kentucky Derby. Racing career As a three-year-old Loser Weeper did not have a significant win but did run second in the Kent Stakes and third in both the Dwyer Stakes and the race named for his sire, the Discovery Handicap. He started to make an impact in racing as a four-year-old when in May of 1949 he won the prestigious Met Mile at Belmont Park under future Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame inductee Hedley Woodhouse. He ended the year with other important victories in the Bay Shore and Vosburgh Handicaps plus the first of back-to-back wins in the Valley Forge Handicap at New Jersey's Garden State Park. At age five in 1950, Loser Weeper had his best year in racing. On May 1, he won the Edward Burke Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack in Maryland then seven days later won his second Valley Forge Handicap in New Jersey, defeating future Canadian Hall of Famer Arise.Returning to Maryland, on May 14 Loser Weeper captured the 49th edition of the Dixie Handicap at Pimlico. =Most important win= Loser Weeper's most important triumph of his career came on May 31, 1950, when he beat a strong contingent in the Suburban Handicap, in which Forence Whitaker's My Request finished a neck back in second place. The overwhelming favorite among bettors was Christopher Chenery's Kentucky Derby runner-up and Preakness winner Hill Prince, who ran a crowd-shocking third. The eventual 1950 American Horse of the Year finished more than seven lengths behind Loser Weeper. In sixth place came Deering Howe's aging gelding Donor, followed by Flying Missel, the second choice of the betting public owned by King Ranch, who was seventh and last. At New York's Empire City Race Track, Loser Weeper won the $50,000 Butler Handicap when Three Rings was disqualified for interference after posting a race-record time for a mile and three- sixteenths that was never surpassed in the event's nineteen-year history. In addition to his important wins, Loser Weeper ran third behind Cochise and runner-up My Request in the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs. The winning time of 2:01 4/5 broke the track record by four-fifths of a second on a track rated fast. Stud record In June 1951, Sagamore Farm manager Ralph Kercheval announced that Loser Weeper would be retired to stud. The durable winner had competed in 63 races and although none of his progeny achieved anything close to his level of success, a significant percentage of them demonstrated that durability.

Biography  Prince Mstislavsky became a public servant in 1575, and by the fall of next year he had become a boyar and led a regiment in his father's army. In the fall of 1579, the prince was briefly appointed as the governor of Novgorod. After the exile of his father in 1586, he was appointed the member in the Duma, a position that he would keep for over 36 years and at the same time, became the highest-paid person in the Tsardom of Russia, with the income of 1200 rubles a year.Jacques Margeret. –°–æ—Å—Ç–æ—è–Ω–∏–µ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–≤—ã –∏ –í–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–Ω—è–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ He was once considered a candidate for the throne after the death of Tsar Fedor in 1598.

He is best known for introducing the finite- difference time-domain method (FDTD) in 1966. His research interests include numerical electromagnetics, fluid dynamics, continuum mechanics and numerical analysis of partial differential equations. Biography Yee was born on March 26, 1934 in Guangzhou, Republic of China. He received his B.S. and M.S. in electrical engineering from University of California, Berkeley in 1957 and 1958, respectively. He has completed his PhD in applied mathematics department at the same university under the supervision of Bernard Friedman in 1963; his dissertation involved the study of boundary value problems for Maxwell's equations. From 1959 to 1961, he was employed at Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, researching diffraction in electromagnetic waves. In 1966, Yee published a paper on the use of a finite difference staggered grids algorithm in the solution of Maxwell's equations. Yee was initially motivated by his self-studies in Fortran to develop the method. Appearing on IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation, the article received little attention at the time of its release. The incorrect numerical stability conditions on Yee's paper were corrected by Dong-Hoa Lam in 1969 and Allen Taflove and Morris E. Brodwin in 1975. The method was subsequently renamed as finite-difference time-domain method in 1980. FDTD is also referred as Yee algorithm, with its specific discretized grid being known as Yee lattice or Yee cell. Between 1966 and 1984, Yee became a professor of electrical engineering and mathematics at the University of Florida and later at Kansas State University. He became a consultant to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1966, working on microwave vulnerability problems at the same institute from 1984 to 1987. In 1987, he became a research scientist at Lockheed Palo Alto Research Lab, working on computational electromagnetics problems and retiring in 1996.

Biography He was born on 2 March, 1734 in Perudina, which was a part of the Duchy of Carniola (today in Slovenia). Since 1755, he had been a member of the Capuchin Order, and was educated in Zagreb, where he was subsequently ordained and spent much of his life and career. He wrote poetic works of secular and religious themes in Kajkavian dialect (with elements of Chakavian) of the Croatian language, often occasional in nature. He was influenced both by medieval religious, and contemporary secular enlightenment literature with Baroque elements. At first, he mostly wrote occasional poetry such as those written for Ivan Krstitelj Paxy (1771) and Maksimilijan Vrhovac (1788), when they were named Bishops of Zagreb and Ivan Nepomuk II Erd≈ëdy, when he was named Ban of Croatia (1790). A number of other publications, published anonymously in Zagreb, are ascribed to him such as Dar za novo leto (1784), two poems for soldiers (published 1787 and 1789), and a poem written during the occasion of the priest's jubilee (1787).

The work was consequently described by August ≈†enoa as a \\"newspaper in verse\\", in which it depicts the Ottomans in ironic and satirical fashion. This was followed by a biblical-allegoric epyllion titled Nebeski pastir pogubljenu ovcu i≈°ƒçe (1795), in which Malevac covered the Parable of the Lost Sheep, drawing from earlier sources. Another work depicting the birth of Christ, Horvacka od Kristu≈°evoga naroƒëenja vitija (1800, Zagreb), is difficult to categorize, but is described by some critics as Malevac's aesthetically best work, on grounds that it is written in a particularly humorous and original way.: Pater Gregur kapucin (Juraj Malevac), kajkavski knji≈æevnik XVIII. vijeka. Rad JAZU, 1915, 207, str. 137‚Äì261I. Zvonar: Tragom kajkavskih pretisaka/Pretisak Nestranƒçnog vezda≈°njega tabora From 1770, he published the folk calendar Novi kalendar (a type of periodical publication similar to a magazine) in which he served as main editor (1801-1811) and to which anonymously contributed a number of literary texts and poems, among which the most notable is the anti-revolutionary poem Horvat Horvatom horvatski govori (A Croatian Speaks Croatian to a Croatian, 1801).When Ethnicity Did Not Matter in the Balkans: A Study of Identity in Pre-Nationalist Croatia, Dalmatia, and Slavonia in the Medieval and Early- Modern Periods, John V.A Fine, University of Michigan Press, Feb 5, 2010, pp. 521 He died in Vara≈ædin on 20 January 1812.

Background Watch Dog was a commercial failure on its release in 1983, as was the single \\"Whispering Your Name\\". \\"All Through the Night\\" was recorded by American singer Cyndi Lauper for her 1983 debut album She's So Unusual. It was released as the album's fourth single and reached No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1984. In 1994, British singer Alison Moyet released her version of \\"Whispering Your Name\\" on her album Essex. As the album's second single, it reached No. 18 on the UK Singles Chart. Critical reception On its release, Billboard felt the album continued the \\"first class songwriting ability\\" of Shear since his earlier work with Jules and the Polar Bears. The magazine summarised the album as \\"intelligent, economical, [and] encompassing a variety of musical systems, but always remaining personal and personable\\". Cash Box felt the album was Shear's \\"most focused pop exercise to date\\", with the songs \\"bear[ing] the indelible stamp of his own lyrical and musical idiosyncrasies, which he and Rundgren have effectively harnessed without diluting\\". Gene Triplett of The Daily Oklahoman noted the \\"plenty of Beatle-esque elements\\", while considering Shear's voice to be \\"a cross between the tragic melancholy of Jackson Browne and the youthful toughness of Todd Rundgren\\". He added: \\"Shear's knack for hooks and for lyrics that fit glove-like into each intricate note and chord change is always infectious and intriguing.\\" Steven X. Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer commented: \\"Watch Dog is a fine record, an eccentric and eloquent collection of songs that deals with love and romance from a decidedly skewed perspective.\\" Tom Long of the Santa Cruz Sentinel felt the album contained songs that were \\"classic Jules tales of confusion and paranoia\\". However, he criticized the lack of hit potential of any of the tracks, which he feared would result in Shear's loss of a recording contract: \\"And that's a bonafide drag, because [he] is probably trying to do more with the lyric side of things than just about anybody now writing.\\" David Okamoto of The Tampa Tribune noted that Shear \\"writes potent pop songs, brimming with lyrical twists strengthened by his straining, coarse vocals\\". In a retrospective review, Chris Woodstra of AllMusic noted the \\"new-found maturity\\" in Shear's songwriting, which he felt displayed an \\"eclectic mix of styles from ultra-smooth pop to R&B-inflected; rockers\\". He picked \\"All Through the Night\\", \\"Whispering Your Name\\" and \\"Longest Drink\\" as some of the album's highlights and summarised Watch Dog as an \\"unjustified commercial sleeper\\".

An early work by the artist, produced soon after finishing his training Andrea del Sarto's studio, it is now owned by the Accademia delle arti del disegno. At least three preparatory drawings for it survive in the Kupferstich-Kabinett, DresdenC80 r. e v., the in Romen. 124229 r. e v. and the Uffizi's Gabinetto dei Disegni e delle Stampe. The two framing standing figures are saint Lucy (left) holding up a plate with her eyes and Michael the Archangel holding a pair of scales by the cups. Either side of the Madonna and Child kneel Saint Agnes and Zechariah. It was detached on a section of wall before the church was demolished in 1823 and moved to the San Luca Chapel in Santissima Annunziata, Florence, which was then being rearranged and where it is now displayed, blocking the old doorway. An upper section showing God the Father and cherubim was destroyed during the detachment. It was removed from the wall again while the church was restored following the 1966 Florence flood. This revealed a sinopia with traces of colours, possibly for another work, attributed to Raffaellino del Garbo. It is thought to have remained visible until Pontormo painted his work over it, for which he made a now-barely-visible under- drawing.

The hospital was run by the Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati and continued to grow with a new 11-story building completed in 1968 that replaced the original 1902 building. In 2002, the hospital was sold due to financial problems and is now part of the Lovelace Health System called Lovelace Medical Center Downtown. The 1930 hospital building was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The hospital is a four-story, Y-shaped Romanesque Revival style building constructed from concrete and brown brick. It was designed by local architect W. Miles Brittelle, who at the time was working for the firm of George M. Williamson. with Brittelle's other works include the President's House at UNM and the Springer Building, among others. The building was reportedly modeled after a recently completed wing at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, which was also run by the Sisters of Charity. The hospital boasted the latest medical technology, including New Mexico's first baby incubator, and had four operating rooms on the fourth floor along with an emergency operating room on the ground floor. The building also had a specially constructed penthouse for safe storage of x-ray film, intended to prevent another deadly disaster like the Cleveland Clinic fire of 1929.

The Flemish artist biographer Cornelis de Bie wrote in his Het Gulden Cabinet published in 1662 that van der Horst (whom de Bie refers to as Nicolaes vander Horst) was trained by Rubens. Upon completing his training he travelled through various countries where, according to de Bie, his work was highly regarded. After returning home, he settled in Brussels, then the capital of the Habsburg Netherlands. Here he worked for the governor generals of the Habsburg Netherlands Archduke Albrecht of Austria and Isabella Clara Eugenia for whom he made many drawings. He was courtier at the court and given the title of Archer de la Garde (Archer of the Guard), a quasi-military ceremonial role. He drew many portraits and other subjects which were engraved by prominent engravers for books and prints. He died in 1646 in Brussels. Work While van der Horst was praised during his lifetime as a good painter in the grand style of Rubens only one signed painting by his hand is known. He is mainly known for his designs for prints and a map, which were engraved by leading printmakers of his time and printed by the Antwerp printers. His subject matter was diverse and included portraits, religious, mythological, allegorical, history and literary subjects. IHe worked with engravers such as Paulus Pontius, Pieter de Jode I, Lucas Vorsterman the Elder, Cornelis Galle the Elder, Abraham Dircksz van Santvoort and Guillaume Collaert. Smell He made a series of the five senses, which was engraved by Guillaume Collaert and published in Antwerp.The print depicting Smell shows a large figure lying on a sumptuous couch with flowers scattered about. He is holding a bouquet the perfume of which he inhales, while he takes other flowers in a vase placed on a table. On the table is also a container in which spices are burning. A standing courtier keeps the odorous combustion going. Through two arcades at the back of the room can be seen some dogs, an altar of perfumes receiving offerings and the high priest offering incense to an altar. Duchess Alexandrine, wife of Duke Leonhard II, tapestry He drew a view of Brussels which was engraved by Abraham Dircksz van Santvoort on three plates. The print shows a bird's eye view of Brussels. He also drew a map of Brussels, which formed the basis of a city plan of Brussels engraved by Abraham Dircksz van Santvoort and published by Martin de Tailly in 1640.Abraham Dircksz.

He was also owner and manager of the Macau Water Supply CompanyWater Supply History to Macau, at Macau Water and founder of the Macau Air Transport Company (MATCO), in 1948.

Biography  Rua Do Dr. Pedro Jose Lobo On January 12, 1892, Pedro Jos√© Lobo was born in Manatuto, in Timor-Leste. Of Portuguese nationality, he was a mestizo Portuguese- descendant or Macanese from Timor, with Malay, Chinese, Dutch and Portuguese ancestors. Lobo's adoptive father was the lawyer Belarmino Lobo, born in Goa on May 21, 1849 and died in Dili on November 9, 1914. On October 20, 1917, the government official in Timor, C√©sar Augusto Rocha de Abreu Castelo Branco released him, \\"upon request, from the position of member of the Dili Municipal Commission\\".Official Bulletin of the Government of the Province of Timor, year 18, (October 20, 1917) No. 42, Ordinance No. 202 , p. 246. Lobo studied at the prestigious S√£o Jos√© Seminary in Macau.Mois√©s Silva Fernandes, The 1952 Portas do Cerco incidents: the conflict between international commitments and local constraints, 2005 On October 16, 1920, Pedro Lobo married in Hong Kong Branca Helena Hyndman, the daughter of an old Macanese family that lived in Macau in the 18th century and in Hong Kong in the early years of its foundation. The Hyndman family, influential in Hong Kong, has Scottish, Portuguese and Asian ancestry.Jos√© Pedro Braga (or JP Braga), The Portuguese in Hong Kong and China, Chapter VIII, The Rise of Hong Kong ‚Äì Early Portuguese Settlers Lobo had six children with Branca Hyndman: Marieta Hyndman Lobo, Olivia Maria Hyndman Lobo, Rog√©rio Hyndman Lobo (or Sir Roger Lobo), Nat√©rcia Hyndman Lobo, Orlando dos Passos Hyndman Lobo and Pedro Hyndman Lobo. = World War II = During World War II, Pedro Lobo, as director of the Central Bureau of Economic Services (also called the Bureau of Economic Services of Macau) had to deal with the Japanese to solve the desperate problem of scarcity of food and other necessities. The Japanese had seized the Hong Kong region in December 1941 and thus de facto controlled the borders of the officially neutral Portuguese colony. To deal with this problem, Pedro Lobo, representing the Government of Macau, proceeded to nationalize all food items in Macau's private businesses and stores. This nationalization consisted of buying all the necessary food items, such as rice, cereals and preserved cans, at a fair market price, and storing them in government stores created for this purpose. However, this solution failed to free Macau from long-term hunger, as many people, especially refugees, were unable to afford the increasingly astronomical prices of food, resorting to and emptying these public stores. As the problem worsened, the Government of Macau, headed by Governor Gabriel Maur√≠cio Teixeira and represented by Pedro Lobo, had to deliver to the Japanese everything that had value, including ships, cannons and communication equipment, in exchange for food. Thus, the Japanese were able to control Macau's economic and political activity. In fact, Colonel Sawa, a commander of the Kempeitai, was effectively the shadow chief of the Macau Bureau of Economic Services, then formally led by Pedro Lobo. To manage trade between the Government and the Japanese, the latter created the Macau Cooperative Company (CCM), a monopoly company owned by the Government (33.3%), the Japanese army (33.3%) and several wealthy entrepreneurs (33.3%), most of whom were from Hong Kong. These entrepreneurs, among whom Sir Robert Ho Tung stood out, managed to take refuge and transfer their business and goods to Macau, even before Hong Kong was occupied by the Japanese. Officially, this monopoly company was managed by Pedro Jos√© Lobo, the delegate of the Government of Macau. But in fact it was controlled by the Japanese and served the Japanese political-military objectives of controlling the circulation of essential goods in Macau. In addition to the Japanese, the Macau Cooperative Company (CCM) also served the interests of its business shareholders and speculators, who were able to profit from the food shortages caused by the war. However, the Macau Government, more concerned with keeping Japanese food permits and meeting the basic needs of its population, did not care that the private shareholders profited from it. From this and other businesses Stanley Ho, who achieved a prominent position at CCM because of his great uncle Robert Ho Tung, and Pedro Jos√© Lobo, became rich. Near the end of the war, on January 16, 1945, the gas tanks of the Outer Harbor and several strategic points in Macau were bombed and machine-gunned by American planes, despite the fact that Macau was neutral territory. The air raid left five dead and several injured. Gasoline, which was to be sold to the Japanese that day in exchange for rice, was set on fire. Lobo, who was the exchange negotiator and was present in the warehouses at the time of the attack, fled immediately to his car, which was also strafed and machine-gunned. He managed to survive because he threw himself on the ground, abandoning the car. = Gold trading = After the Second World War, the gold trade became one of the most important economic activities in Macau, because Macau was not currently covered by the 1944 Bretton Woods agreements. These international agreements fixed exchange rates and restricted world trade in gold, banning imports of gold for individual use and stipulating that each troy ounce of gold legally cost US$35., MACAU Magazine At that time, the lucrative but obscure trade in gold was effectively controlled by a restricted group of businessmen from Macau and Hong Kong, among whom were Ho Sin Hang, Cheng Yu Tung,Vasco Silv√©rio Marques, and An√≠bal Mesquita Borges, The gold trade in Macau, Today Macau, July 6, 2009 YC Liang, Ho Yin and Pedro Jos√© Lobo. With his involvement in the gold trade, Pedro Lobo became one of the wealthiest men in Macau and Far East, in the 1950s. However, not all historians agree that the concession of the monopoly of the gold trade was attributed to Pedro Lobo. In addition to being an entrepreneur, he also controlled the issuing and granting of licenses for import, including gold, since he was at the time the head of the Central Bureau of Economic Services of Macau. With this control, Pedro Lobo managed to create \\"a group of strong allies, who gave him information, who told him what was going on\\". At the time, it was said that Pedro Lobo was the only citizen of Macau who could smuggle gold without being arrested by the authorities. This gold was purchased in countries that did not adhere to the Bretton Woods Agreements (e.g. Russia and Mexico) at a price much lower than the international reference value stipulated by the Agreements. The gold was transported from Hong Kong to Macau every Saturday by a seaplane Catalina from Macau Air Transport Company (MATCO). It was said that the police themselves helped to unload this gold, which was then sold at an international reference price ($35 per ounce) in Macau, entering the official circuit and thus giving Pedro Lobo a good profit. Pedro Jos√© Lobo also profited from the Macau-Hong Kong air link made by Macau Air Transport Company (MATCO) seaplanes, which was founded in 1948 by Pedro Lobo and the Cathay Pacific founders. At the time, this company was the only company that flew the Macau-Hong Kong air route and served to transport gold from Hong Kong to Macau. This gold, which arrived in Hong Kong from several different countries, could not be traded in Hong Kong, because this British colony was covered by the Bretton Woods Agreements at that time. Due to this fact, a Macau-Hong Kong trade axis was established, in which Hong Kong, British, French, Swiss, and American businessmen also participated, thus using Macau to \\"legalize [their] business\\". Due to his importance and wealth, several magazines and writers wrote about Pedro Lobo, as was the case with Life magazine and the book \\"Thrilling Cities\\" (1959) by Ian Fleming, best known for being the creator of James Bond. Ian Fleming, who visited Macau in 1959, interviewed Pedro Lobo about the gold trade and his impressions of Macau. Some authors claim that Pedro Jos√© Lobo served as the basis for the creation of the characters Goldfinger and Oddjob, who appear in the adventures of James Bond. = Siege Gate Incident = In 1952, during Joaquim Marques Esparteiro, the Portas do Cerco Incident took place, a series of small armed conflicts between Portuguese and Chinese soldiers at the Portas do Cerco, the land border between Macau and Mainland China. At that time, this boundary was not yet well-defined, thus generating confusion and disputes. The incident was mainly caused by the fact that the Government of Macau decided, under pressure from the governments of Portugal and the United States of America, to increase control of the movement of goods between Macau and the People's Republic of China, which at that time was under a Western embargo. The Government planned to set up a Trade Coordinating Commission, independent of the Sino-Macanese elite, to exercise control of movement. Armed conflicts intensified in May, June, and mainly in July, when the Chinese authorities unilaterally imposed a blockade on commercial, land, river, and sea communications between Macau and mainland China. This blockade caused a major shortage of basic goods, mainly food, in Macau. In August, after intense negotiations through local diplomatic intermediaries, the authorities in Macau and mainland China were able to resolve the incident. These diplomatic intermediaries were members of the local Sino-Macanese elite, among whom Ho Yin, Ma Man-kei, and Pedro Jos√© Lobo stood out. In fact, it was Pedro Lobo who managed to resolve the impasse of the negotiations, by suggesting offering his personal regret for the incident, thus not compromising the Portuguese administration of Macau. In August 1952, Lobo eventually signed a written apology on behalf of the Portuguese administration in Zhuhai and provided compensation for the Chinese casualties. The resolution of the incident allowed the People's Republic of China to continue to use Macau as a gateway for necessary and strategic goods prohibited by the Western embargo. According to Portuguese historian Mois√©s Silva Fernandes, the increased status that Pedro Jos√© Lobo and Ho Yin came to enjoy after the incident allowed them to prevent, during the next ten years, any increase in taxes and fees on the gold monopoly previously granted to Pedro Lobo and Ho Yin by the Government of Macau. Pedro Lobo's importance was also revealed in the great influence he had on the newly created Trade Coordinating Commission, which was supposed to be theoretically independent from the local elite. In fact, before the incident Governor Esparteiro had secretly ordered the commission to \\"maintain an intimate collaboration\\" with Pedro Lobo, because he \\"has extensive experience in the matter and [his] indications and advice can be very useful\\", this support being \\"indispensable for the smooth running of the work under the responsibility of the Commission\\". = Culture and arts = Being a great lover of culture and especially music, Pedro Lobo directed operettas and wrote several musical works, some of which were praised by the Musical Academy of Lisbon. His musical compositions were grouped into several albums. One of his most important and famous compositions was an operetta in three acts, called \\"Cruel Separation\\", first presented to the public in 1950/1951. In 1950, Pedro Lobo founded the Cultural Circle of Macau (CCM), which aimed to \\"promote the dissemination of artistic-literary culture, especially Portuguese [...] and make Macau, under all its multiple aspects, better and more perfectly known in the Metropolis, in the other Portuguese colonies, and in all parts of the world where the mother tongue\\" is spoken. Among other things, the CCM published the cultural magazine \\"Mosaico\\", written in Portuguese, Chinese and English. The main contributors to \\"Mosaico\\" were Graciette Batalha, Father Fernando Herberto Maciel, Henrique de Senna Fernandes, Jos√© Silveira Machado, Lu√≠s Gonzaga Gomes, Captain Pimentel Bastos, L√≠gia Pinto Ribeiro and Ant√≥nio Nolasco. Basically, the various activities sponsored and organized by the CCM marked and enriched Macau's cultural life in the 1950s.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in 1955. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman and directed by Nina Lopez-Corrado. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova- Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode moves to Area 51 in 1955 after the season explored the 1930s in the first two episodes. Filming took place in deserts around California, with authentic period costumes designed for the episode. Guest star Enver Gjokaj reprises his role of Daniel Sousa from the MCU series Agent Carter. \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" originally aired on ABC on June 10, 2020, and was watched by 1.57 million viewers. The episode received generally positive reviews, particularly for its fun tone, but with mixed responses for its attempts to address the racism and misogyny of the era. Plot The Chronicoms meet with their Predictor, Sibyl, to confirm that their latest plan to eliminate S.H.I.E.L.D. from history will succeed. Meanwhile, the agents land in 1955 near Area 51, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base currently working on Project Helius, an ion fusion reactor prototype. The agents kidnap high ranking agent Gerald Sharpe so the Phil Coulson LMD can impersonate him while Jemma Simmons impersonates S.H.I.E.L.D.'s then-current director, Peggy Carter, to locate Chronicom infiltrators. However, they unexpectedly run into Carter's former partner Daniel Sousa, who immediately outs them and has them detained. Concurrently, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Melinda May, Deke Shaw, and Inhuman agent Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez attempt to interrogate Sharpe to find out more about Project Helius. Though he puts up resistance, he eventually reveals Helius cannot function without a powerful energy source, leading Deke to deduce that the Chronicoms plan to sacrifice one of their own to activate the weapon and destroy the base. Agent Daisy Johnson arrives undercover and convinces Sousa to free her teammates just as a pair of Chronicoms enact their plan. May and Yo-Yo's first attempt to stop them fails after the former unexpectedly suffers a panic attack and the latter discovers her powers are not working. Recovering quickly once Area 51's evacuated, they chase one down while Coulson battles the other. Daisy and Simmons improve a S.H.I.E.L.D. EMP device in time to disable Helius, along with the entire base, the Chronicoms, and Coulson. The other agents regroup at their mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, while Sousa detains Coulson and Mack and Shaw pose as aliens to avoid changing history while returning Sharpe to the desert. ProductionDevelopment and writing = After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" and written by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman. It was confirmed to be the third episode of the season in June 2020, when Nina Lopez-Corrado was revealed to have directed it. Nora Zuckerman revealed there were a few title options for the episode, but \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" was chosen because \\"it had the best ring to it\\" and felt like \\"a cool '50s monster movie title\\". After being assigned the third episode of the season, the Zuckerman siblings knew the episode was going to be set in either the 1940s or 1950s, and at one point was considering the Roswell UFO incident to be the backdrop for the episode. Jed Whedon ultimately suggested using Area 51, which Nora called \\"perfect\\" since \\"it fit with the MCU timeline\\". =Casting= Enver Gjokaj makes his first appearance in the series with this episode, reprising his Agent Carter role of Daniel Sousa With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. In August 2019, Enver Gjokaj was expected to reprise his role as Agent Daniel Sousa from the series Agent Carter, which was confirmed in April 2020. Whedon and Tancharoen previously worked with Gjokaj on Dollhouse and were excited to explore his character further on S.H.I.E.L.D. They had discussed having Gjokaj appear in previous seasons of the series, with discussion about revisiting Sousa with flashbacks at different points during the series, or having Gjokaj reprise his minor role from The Avengers as a New York City cop, before deciding that it would make sense to include him in a crossover with Agent Carter during the final season due to the time travel storyline. Gjokaj felt the storyline allowed the series to \\"open up\\". Bell said Sousa would be seen in a \\"different light\\", and would bring a new flavor to the series' character dynamics, with Gjokaj adding the character had become \\"a bit of a 007, but mostly in the ways of intrigue and espionage\\" since the events of Agent Carter. Whedon added that having Sousa allows Coulson, a \\"fanboy for S.H.I.E.L.D. history\\", to interact with that history. Gjokaj guest stars in \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" alongside Tobias Jelinek as Luke, Julian Acosta as Pascal Vega, Michael Gaston as Gerald Sharpe, and Tamara Taylor as the Chronicom predictor Sibyl. Jelinek returns from the first two episodes of the season. Julian Acosta is married to the episode's director, Nina Lopez-Corrado, and Nora Zuckerman called Acosta \\"absolutely perfect\\" to play Vega. One of the reasons Taylor was cast was for her voice. Taylor stated she had \\"no point of reference\\" for portraying Sibyl, but was given \\"some pretty key notes\\" such as to make her more soothing, calming, and in control than the other Chronicoms. Taylor tried to do this while still making the character \\"somewhat creepy\\". Sibyl's hairstyle was also suggested by Taylor. =Design=Costumes Costume designer Whitney Galitz said the 1950s \\"didn't just mean poodle skirts and sherburts\\", and she wanted to use some saturated colors to contrast with the \\"dusty and muted tones of the desert town\\". Imogene Chayes of Marvel's Visual Development group provided concept art for the costumes. Galitz wanted to stay true to the costumes used for Sousa in Agent Carter, while updating them for the 1950s setting and for his new position at the Area 51 base. She also took inspiration from Cary Grant for the character. Sousa's suit was created by High Society Custom Tailor. For Simmons undercover as Peggy Carter, Galitz built a \\"power suit\\" using a \\"Dior silhouette jacket with the nipped in waist and a no-nonsense pencil skirt\\" that she hoped was reminiscent of Carter's costumes from Agent Carter while looking correct for Simmons and the 1950s setting. Galitz created a custom suit for Coulson undercover using glen plaid fabric sourced by High Society. The vintage ties in the episode were also created by Galitz's team. May and Yo-Yo go undercover in the episode as test pilots, which is accurate for women in the period. The idea for this was suggested by Wen, and Nora Zuckerman said it \\"worked perfectly for the episode\\". Galitz based the costumes worn by the pair on the uniforms used by members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots. Title sequence This episode moves to Area 51 in 1955 and features a title card with a font that \\"appears to be lifted from a classic alien invasion movie\\", evoking a 1950s \\"classic sci-fi\\" style to reflect the setting. An \\"outer spacey\\" rendition of the opening music is also heard. Michal Schick of Hypable felt the title card was \\"deliciously kitschy\\". =Filming= The Club Ed diner set used in the episode Director Nina Lopez-Corrado was going for a \\"Coen brothers kind of look\\" with the episode, resulting in slight changes to the way the episode was shot compared to other episodes of the series. Examples included not shooting actors over the shoulder and having \\"clean POVs\\". Filming for the episode's opening scene, where the team arrives in 1955, and for the diner took place at Lancaster, California. Lopez-Corrado called the diner location, a set known as \\"Club Ed\\", \\"perfect because we needed a diner and it had to be in the desert,\\" adding that the location is \\"a blank space\\" allowing the production designer to bring in the desired set pieces and props. Area 51 was filmed at Mystery Mesa in Santa Clarita, California. Due to recent wet weather in the area, the desert appears greener in the episode than the crew had planned. =Visual effects= Visual effects for the Zephyr arriving in 1955 were created by FuseFX. Rhythm and Hues created the Helius explosion, while CoSA VFX provided the effects for the Chronicom connecting to Helius and for the time stream that the Chronicoms study. For the Quinjet at the end of the episode, visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack asked for a large fan to be used on set to simulate the wind that the Quinjet would be creating. The fan had to be turned off when it blew sand all over actor Michael Gaston, and due to the scene being filmed at the end of the day there was not enough time to retrieve an alternative. Kolpack directed the visual effects for the scene to attempt to explain why there was no wind on Gaston by adjusting the angle of the Quinjet. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= References are made to Sousa's involvement in the second season of Agent Carter, including the defeat of Hugh Jones and the Council of Nine. Release \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on June 10, 2020. ReceptionRatings= In the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.57 million viewers. Viewership increased from the previous episode, while the rating share was the same. Within a week of release, \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" was watched by 2.66 million viewers. =Critical response= Matt Webb Mitovich of TVLine called \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" \\"one of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.s most entertaining episodes ever\\", highlighting the dialogue and 1950s elements such as the title card, while Christian Holub at Entertainment Weekly graded the episode a \\"B+\\". Syfy Wires Trent Moore also felt this was the first episode of the season \\"that really felt 'fun' in that Marvel-y way this series has pioneered at this point\\" after the first two \\"had to do a bit of narrative heavy-lifting\\". Moore also pointed out \\"the writers continue to have a deft handling of addressing issues of race and sexism\\" of the era, show the bathrooms being segregated and how General Sharpe might talk to Deke because he was a white male. He enjoyed Coulson's fight with the Chronicom, saying it was \\"something straight out of a Terminator movie\\". Writing for Bam! Smack! Pow!, Wesley Coburn graded the episode an \\"A-\\", saying \\"packed a solid mix of heavy emotional toll underneath a glossy outer coating of nostalgic chrome brightness, making for a very solid episode overall.\\" Awarding the episode a \\"B\\", The A.V. Clubs Alex McLevy felt the episode was \\"a mostly solid installment of the time-hop mission\\" adding \\"the Area 51 sequence is fleet and funny, and some solid fight choreography helps maintain momentum.\\" Highlights for McLevy were the sequence where Coulson and Simmons tried to find the Chronicoms, particularly Coulson repeating the word \\"moist\\" and using the replicant test from Blade Runner, and the period appropriate technology, sets, and costumes. Unlike Moore, McLevy felt the attempt to address the social issues of the era were less successful, saying \\"The series is probably wise to keep tap-dancing around the virulent racism and misogyny of these past eras... but the only thing using it as a minor plot point does is remind the viewer of what lengths they‚Äôre going to in order to dodge the subject the rest of the time\\". Michael Ahr from Den of Geek felt the episode was extremely current, and that examining some of the racism from the 1950s and exploring UFO culture helped elevate an \\"otherwise okay episode\\". Ahr called Sousa's appearance the \\"highlight\\" of the episode, and was a reminder \\"that Agent Carter ended too soon\\". He also, like McLevy, enjoyed the Chronicom interrogation sequence. However, Ahr felt the plot of the episode \\"wasn‚Äôt all that compelling overall\\" and ultimately gave the episode 3.5 out of 5 stars. Michal Shick at Hypable called the episode \\"gosh-darned delightful\\" explaining, \\"From giddily feigned identities to terrifying moments that force agents to question their essential selves, \\"Alien Commies From the Future!\\" keeps nudging our heroes to probe at deep and important uncertainties.\\" However, Shick felt the series \\"still hasn‚Äôt quite found its lane as far as translating historical attitudes towards race into its sci-fi aesthetic\\", with some of this commentary \\"land[ing] with something of an ungraceful thunk.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\" at ABC * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

History The Tsenter Avangard emerged from a split in the Jewish Social Democratic Labour Organization in Argentina (Avangard), a Bundist group. The founders of Tsenter Avangard were known as the iskrovzes faction, a name inspired by the Russian publication Iskra. They were Russian speakers and had an assimilationist approach in contrast to the Yiddishkayt line of the Bundists. In March 1908, the iskrovzes founded the 'Russian Circle'. The Russian Circle was admitted as a language propaganda unit in the Socialist Party under the name Centro Avangard. During the split in Avangard, the two factions fought over control of the library of the organization. Key figures of Tsenter Avangard were A. Bondarev and Y. Sheyner. Tsenter Avangard published Di shtime fun Avangard (, 'Voice of the Vanguard') as its organ 1908‚Äì1910. Tsenter Avangard was rendered largely defunct under the state of siege of the 1910 Argentina Centennial. In 1914 the Socialist Party closed down the Tsenter Avangard and its other language centres.

Based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D., it follows a Life Model Decoy of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to stop the Chronicoms from unraveling history in 1955. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's films. The episode was written by Mark Leitner and directed by Garry A. Brown. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, starring alongside Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward. The episode remains in 1955 after the characters traveled to that year in the previous episode, but takes on a film noir tone and is shown almost entirely in black and white; the episode was filmed in color like other episodes of the series before being re-graded to be black and white. Its title is a reference to the 1947 noir film of the same name. Guest star Enver Gjokaj reprises his role of Daniel Sousa from the MCU television series Agent Carter. \\"Out of the Past\\" originally aired on ABC on June 17, 2020, and was watched by 1.40 million viewers. It received generally positive reviews for its noir tone and black and white imagery. Plot Following the events of \\"Alien Commies from the Future!\\", the Phil Coulson LMD has been arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Daniel Sousa for trespassing on Area 51, as well as seeing the world in black- and-white and hearing an internal monologue due to damage sustained while battling the Chronicoms. Realizing today is the day Sousa is killed by the Russians after delivering vital technology to Howard Stark, Coulson uses his historical knowledge to impersonate Sousa's contact and convince him they are to pick up the device while in transit. He also makes contact with his team via their Chronicom ally Enoch to let them know what he is doing. Agents Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez and Deke Shaw pick up the device, but the latter is kidnapped by Hydra agents and taken to their boss, Wilfred Malick, who has since become a high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. officer since Deke last encountered him in 1931. Despite the danger, Deke manages to convince Malick to let him go after reminding the latter that he spared his life. After Chronicoms attack them on the way, Coulson and his team evacuate Sousa onto their mobile headquarters, Zephyr One, posing as top-secret government operatives to maintain history. Following Melinda May's uncharacteristic behavior around Sousa and the device, scientist Jemma Simmons discovers May acquired the ability to experience others' emotions. When Sousa reveals that he knows Hydra has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., Coulson deduces that the former actually killed him to prevent him from revealing their secret. After conferring with Director Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie and Agent Daisy Johnson, they decide to find a way to save Sousa without changing history. Suspicious of the team's intentions however, Sousa flees Zephyr One to make his delivery. He successfully makes it to the rendezvous point and delivers the device before the modern day agents tranquilize him, allowing Coulson to impersonate him and fake his death. Back onboard Zephyr One, Coulson tells Sousa that they are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents from the future, and that to protect the timeline, he cannot go back to 1955. Simmons repairs Coulson as the team jumps to 1973. Unbeknownst to them, a Chronicom stayed behind to propose an alliance with Malick. ProductionDevelopment= After the sixth season finale of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. aired in August 2019, showrunners Jed Whedon, Maurissa Tancharoen, and Jeffrey Bell revealed that the seventh season would feature the team trying to save the world from invasion by the Chronicoms. They use time travel to do this, allowing the season to explore the history of S.H.I.E.L.D. Later that month, one of the season's episodes was revealed to be titled \\"Out of the Past\\" and written by Mark Leitner. It was confirmed to be the fourth episode of the season in June 2020, when Garry A. Brown was revealed to have directed it. The episode's title is a reference to the 1947 noir film of the same name. =Writing= The episode is set in 1955, like the previous one, but takes on a film noir tone, with most of the episode in black and white. In the episode, the Phil Coulson Life Model Decoy is malfunctioning, becoming the framing device for the noir tone, with Coulson seeing everything in black and white and having an internal monologue, thus serving as the episode's narrator. Bell had the idea to do an episode in black and white at the start of the season, which director Garry A. Brown felt was \\"so unique\\" to do for a television episode. Whedon added that it was not \\"a gimmick\\" since being in black and white had a story point and logic attached to it, making it \\"an instant sell\\". Enver Gjokaj spoke about Daniel Sousa joining the S.H.I.E.L.D. team at the end of the episode, saying \\"he's on the ride for the time being\\". Gjokaj added that Sousa is \\"very conflicted about being taken out of time, as you can imagine, because of all of the things that he had to love for in that time period.\\" =Casting= With the season renewal, main cast members Ming-Na Wen, Chloe Bennet, Elizabeth Henstridge, Henry Simmons, Natalia Cordova-Buckley, and Jeff Ward were confirmed to be returning from previous seasons as Melinda May, Daisy Johnson / Quake, Jemma Simmons, Alphonso \\"Mack\\" MacKenzie, Elena \\"Yo-Yo\\" Rodriguez, and Deke Shaw, respectively. Series star Clark Gregg also returns as his character Phil Coulson, portraying a Life Model Decoy version of the character in the seventh season. Enver Gjokaj reprises his Agent Carter role of agent Daniel Sousa in \\"Out of the Past\\", guest starring alongside Joel Stoffer as Enoch and Tobias Jelinek as Luke, all returning from earlier episodes of the season. They are joined by Neal Bledsoe as Wilfred Malick, a character introduced in earlier episodes as a younger man in 1931 portrayed by Darren Barnet. Barnet had discussed playing the older version of the character with old-age make-up while filming his appearances as the younger Malick, but the production chose to cast an older actor because the age difference was too much. Larry Clarke also guest stars. =Design= The episode's opening sequence is an homage to Sunset Boulevards (1950) \\"iconic opening of the dead body floating in a pool\\", with a title card that is a \\"throwback-style credit intro\\". When designing the costumes in the episode, costume designer Whitney Galitz had to create costumes that would work in both black and white and color, since they are featured both ways in the episode. Galitz felt some of her color and pattern choices \\"work[ed] well on the body but when shown in [black and white looked] totally different\\". Her fittings with Cordova-Buckley were photographed in both color and black and white to help see what would work in the episode. =Filming and visual effects= The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel featured prominently in the episode The episode was filmed in color, and all the visual effects were created in color as they normally would be. The episode was then color graded to be in black and white. The video monitors on set were also in black and white to aid in shooting the episode. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. films with zoom lens, but for this episode, director Garry A. Brown chose 29 mm, 50 mm, 75 mm, and 100 mm prime lens \\"to help with the 1950s authenticity\\". Brown said \\"the favorite\\" lens was the 29 mm \\"because you could get in nice and close to the actors and you also stay wide enough to see the environment that you're shooting in\\". To be further authentic, Brown utilized many tight shots on the actors and the mechanism on the camera that could quickly change the shot to a Dutch angle. Cinematographer Kyle Jewell used a light filter over the camera lens to give lights in the episode a \\"bloom quality\\", which was compared to the 1959 television series The Twilight Zone. The sequences with Coulson and Sousa on the train were filmed on an actual train, rather than using green screen. Filming on the train reminded Gjokaj of filming on Agent Carter because of the period wardrobe and setting and the many extras used. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel was one of the locations in Los Angeles the episode was able to shoot at, since the episode was set in the city. =Music= \\"No More Mr. Nice Guy\\" by Alice Cooper was featured at the end of the episode to indicate the team's time jump to 1973. Release \\"Out of the Past\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on June 17, 2020. ReceptionRatings= In the United States the episode received a 0.3 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 0.3 percent of all households in that demographic. It was watched by 1.40 million viewers. Within a week of release, \\"Out of the Past\\" was watched by 2.47 million viewers. =Critical response= Writing for Bam! Smack! Pow!, Wesley Coburn gave the episode an \\"A\\", saying the episode was \\"a wild ride through trying times that succeeds brilliantly.\\" Trent Moore at Syfy Wire called \\"Out of the Past\\" \\"a fun one, and you can tell [the creators are] pulling out all the stops for the final few adventures.\\" In his episode recap, Entertainment Weeklys Christian Houlb felt the episode was \\"a pretty fun noir parody\\". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"B+\\", saying it \\"isn't a perfect episode, but it's so much fun that it manages to coast by on the strength of its numerous charms\\". He felt the episode fully committed to the noir premise by going \\"beyond mere black and white imagery to utilize hardened gumshoe voiceover, [and] a bevy of canted camera angles\\". Den of Geeks Michael Ahr said the episode \\"found a clever way to tell a rather mundane story, and in some ways it was successful in upending expectations and delivering on its mysteries.\\" He felt the smaller moments, such as Yo-Yo and Deke's conversation and May discovering her powers, were \\"the more powerful\\" in the episode. He also enjoyed Sousa's character arc, and awarded the episode 3.5 stars out of 5. ReferencesExternal links *\\"Out of the Past\\" at ABC * Category:Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Biography Melton was born in Texas, February 1895 to Sherd Melton and Hesta Long. She grew up in Bayfield, Wisconsin. Melton taught in a primary school in Colorado for a time before she went to the University of Colorado to study civil engineering. She graduated in 1920 and got a job in the United States Bureau of Public Roads. She initially worked in the drafting department, before being promoted to Junior Bridge Engineer. Melton worked in San Francisco at the district office, then as assistant bridge engineer in the Missoula office. Melton was a member of the American Association of Engineers and she was the first woman to become a member of the Colorado Society of Engineers. She was an active member of the associations. In 1921, she gave a talk at the Missoula branch of the AAE. The Shanghai Times hailed her as \\"Woman Bridge Builder, in spite of her youth, is as good a civil engineer as any man in the United States\\". In 1922, The Woman Engineer reprinted this article in the journal. When Melton worked with Hilda Counts, to create an American Society of Women Engineers and Architects they wrote to all US universities with Engineering departments to find how many women were students. The replies were notable for the number which stated ‚Äòthis university does not have and never expects to have any women engineering students‚Äô. Despite the great number of negative replies it turned out that there were about 200 women students in engineering courses. So the couple announced the establishment of the association and succeeded in a number of women joining in 1919 to 1920. Long term the association did not last but it did foreshadow the US Society of Women Engineers. Personal life Melton married Dr. Archibald Shepard Merrill who later became Professor of Mathematics. They had one daughter, Janet and lived in Missoula, Montana. Melton was involved with the university Mathematics Society. She taught mathematics at Montana State University and joined the Montana State Board of Examiners in 1953. She died in 1974. She is remembered in the Rocky Mountain Pioneer Scholarship.

The story follows the adventures of Mamiya Mugen, a teenage detective from the Showa era Japan, retold in multiple alternate continuities. The second and main series was loosely adapted into an OVA in 1985, while a crowdfunding campaign for a live action film opened in 2015.Mugen Shinshi Mystery Manga Gets Crowdfunding Campaign for Live-Action Film Plot The first manga series introduces Mamiya Mugen, the child heir of a rich family that enjoys solving crimes for the Japanese police during the Showa era. Although young, he has telepathic powers and a keen intellect, and is helped by his faithful butler Alucard. Some of the cases he gets involved with are occult or supernatural in nature. The series was revamped for the second manga publishing, Boken Katsugeki-hen, where the story remains almost the same, although containing more gags and humor. Mugen lacks any superpower now, and solves cases with the help of his butler Alucard and his love interest Atsuko. However, the shady story of his family intervenes as well, forcing him to confront his villainous father and aunt. This iteration of the series received an OVA whose story conflates and references several of the manga's chapters. A much more serious, almost horror-oriented view of the series is given in its third continuity, Kaiki- hen, where Mugen is now a suave, distinguished ladies man in his twenties. He works mostly alone and meets a long string of lovers in his cases, but is helped by his spiritual powers and his mentor Professor Yokomizo. This style was kept in the work's fourth version, in which Mamiya has a different set of powers. The last series is the trilogy Gensho-hen/Oma-hen/Meikyu-hen, in which Mugen is presented as a supernatural entity unrelated to humanity that fights monsters and demons. Characters ; : The work's protagonist, a child detective who solves crimes with his genius mind (and in some continuities, his supernatural powers).
