West is the coast of the Indian Ocean. Approximately 75% of the suburb is still within its native state. History =Name= The name Jindalee was proposed by the Shire of Wanneroo on 29 June 1979 and is an imported Aboriginal word from an unknown New South Wales dialect meaning \\"a bare hill\\", most likely referring to Eglinton Hill, which is covered in low vegetation. The suburb of Jindalee in south-western Brisbane, applied in 1964, notes the same word origin. =Suburban development= The planning of Jindalee goes back to 1997, but the Butler-Jindalee District Structure Plan was approved on 18 November 2003 by the Western Australian Planning Commission.

It is located 36 kilometres (22 mi) north of Perth's central business district, and forms part of the City of Wanneroo local government area. After being briefly used for its limestone deposits in the early 20th century, the suburb was formally established in 1988 with the construction of the Mindarie Marina and hotel, one of the largest man-made marina resorts in the state. Several shops, restaurants and schools are now dispersed throughout the rest of the area, which is primarily residential in character. A number of large bushland reserves and parks preserve Mindarie's previously natural state, such as its large coastal dunes. Mindarie was used as one of the filming locations for the children's science fiction television series Stormworld. Geography Mindarie is formally bounded by Quinns Road, Marmion Avenue and the Indian Ocean. The suburbs of Clarkson and Merriwa lie to the east, and Quinns Rocks lies to the north. South of Mindarie is the uninhabited locality of Tamala Park. Large swathes of natural bushland and coastline are preserved in various parks throughout the suburb, including Claytons Beach, Rosslare Park, Kinsale Park and the North and South Mindarie Foreshores. The foreshore reserves contain large Quindalup dunes and various examples of Swan Coastal Plain vegetation. The South Mindarie Foreshore was subject to coastal rehabilitation works in 2011 to protect the dunes and vegetation growing there. History =Name= Mindarie was named after Lake Mindarie in nearby Carabooda. The name is a Noongar word meaning either \\"stand by\\" or \\"green water\\", first recorded by Alexander Forrest in 1874. A town also named Mindarie, in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia, claims origin from a Dieri word meaning \\"festival to invoke peace\\". The area was initially gazetted as \\"Clarkson\\" by the Shire of Wanneroo in 1979, with the name Mindarie being allocated to the adjacent locality directly east. The two names were transposed in 1985 at the request of Smith Corporation, the developers of the Mindarie marina.\\"A History of Quinns Rocks\\" by Barbara Arthur & Betty Hunt- Smith =Early use and limestone industry= Cooper's lime kilns at Coopers Park The Mooro group of Noongar were said to be familiar with Mindarie, including Waukolup Hill in neighbouring Tamala Park, but no Mooro settlements were ever formally established in the area. After John Butler's initial expedition to Wanneroo in 1835, the first permanent European settler was sheep-farmer Bernard Clarkson, who first acquired a pastoral lease in 1888 of 13,000 acres in the areas comprising modern-day Mindarie, Clarkson, Quinns Rocks and Merriwa. The leases were known as the Mindarie Pastoral Company, and the lands were primarily used for sheep-herding by subsequent generations of the Clarkson family. Another early settler, Henry Cooper and his brothers, built two lime kilns at Mindarie in 1932 after the closure of their quarries in Wembley. The Cooper family produced and sold treated limestone in Perth and Fremantle as the Quinns Rocks Lime Stone Company, and were some of the first permanent residents of the nearby Quinns Rocks townsite. The kilns provided work for up to thirty-two labourers, who settled in Mindarie in makeshift jarrah shacks, and are commonly held as a symbol of the diversification of industry brought on by the Great Depression at the time. The Coopers ceased lime-burning operations in 1948 after exhausting good quality limestone supplies in the area. The kilns underwent restoration in 2001 and are preserved today in the Coopers Park bushland reserve in Mindarie. They are regarded as sites of architectural interest, due to their skilled, vernacular design and their coastal location minutes away from the Indian Ocean, unusual for lime-burning operations in the Wanneroo area. =Marina & Harbourside Village development= Mindarie Marina & Hotel After the closure of the lime kilns, John Clarkson sold the Mindarie Pastoral Company leases in 1952, and the area remained unpopulated and unused until 1981, when Smith Corporation purchased 316 hectares of land there for $5.5 million. In July 1984, the company announced plans to develop the land into \\"Mindarie Keys\\", a $28 million marina and resort complex designed by James Christou & Partners, to be ready in time for the 1987 America's Cup in Fremantle. In the same year, plans were also proposed for a refuse disposal plant in the area to handle landfill waste from the Shire of Wanneroo, the City of Stirling and the City of Perth local areas. Both developments caused controversy with existing residents in nearby Quinns Rocks, who formed the Quinns Rocks Environment Group in June 1985 to bring together a formal opposition against the proposals. In 1988, Tamala Park was gazetted from land formerly part of southern Mindarie, and was set aside for refuse disposal, as well as public open space. Due to the environmental and planning concerns surrounding the marina project, it did not receive final approval from the State Government until 1986, which was too late for construction to finish before the America's Cup defence began. Nonetheless, the first stage of Mindarie Keys development, including the harbour, marina and hotel, began in February 1988, and the first residential lots in southern and western Mindarie began to sell at the same time. During construction however, Smith Corporation and its joint venture partners ran into several problems, including massive cost overruns, unrealistic estimates of the land value and poor sales of the residential subdivisions surrounding the marina, brought on by the late 1980s recession. This was also compounded by cheaper, competing residential developments being sold in neighbouring Quinns Rocks. Mindarie Keys Marina was finally completed and opened to the public a year later, at a total cost of $34 million. However, the aforementioned problems ended with Smith Corporation losing control of the project to their financiers, Beneficial Finance, who stalled further development and expenditure to focus solely on selling all remaining residential lots. The project eventually fell into the hands of receivers after the collapse of Beneficial Finance's parent company, the State Bank of South Australia, in 1991. =Mindarie Keys residential development= Lamppost with Mindarie Keys street sign. Mindarie Keys Joint Venture, a consortium of developers and investors led by Fini Group (now part of Mirvac), bought the fledgling Mindarie Keys project in 1996 from the South Australian Asset Management Corporation, after several years of receivership and lack of sales or development. The consortium devised a structure plan for new residential developments in the northern half of Mindarie, as well as the sale and development of older, unsold lots around the Harbourside Village. The new estate, which shares the name \\"Mindarie Keys\\" with the marina and harbourside village, was approved by the City of Wanneroo in 1998 and was an award-winning sales success, making Mindarie one of the highest-selling suburbs in Western Australia at the time. The estate is bounded to the west by Anchorage Drive South and Seaham Way, to the south by Honiara Way and to the south-east by Rothesay Heights and Rochester Drive. The area is distinguished from the rest of Mindarie by unique, blue lampposts and street signs, featuring Mirvac's Mindarie Keys logo. =Catalina development= A new residential estate in Mindarie and Clarkson under the name of \\"Catalina\\" is being planned for development in 2012. The estate's proposed boundaries lay south of Neerabup Road (which is presently bushland blending into Tamala Park) and extend from the Joondalup railway line in eastern Clarkson, to the South Mindarie Foreshore in western Mindarie. Although the land is part of Mindarie and Clarkson at present, Satterley, the developers, intend for the estate to eventually be re-gazetted as its own suburb. Demographics Mindarie Marina Mindarie has a unique demographic profile, compared to surrounding areas. At the 2006 census, 6,507 people were resident in Mindarie, up from 4,675 at the 2001 census. The population is predicted to continue growing at a steady pace, peaking at 9,782 in 2026. Of these, only 46.21% were born in Australia, compared to a national average of 70.9%. Mindarie contains a substantial British-born population of 31.27%, a disproportionately high figure compared to the surrounding coastal area, as well as the Australian national average of 5%. The median age of the suburb's residents was 36 years, in line with 37 for both the Perth region and Australia generally. The predominant religious affiliation in Mindarie is Christianity, with 59.7% of residents declaring various Christian denominations. The only church in Mindarie is the Anglican Church of Australia in the suburb's north, in line with 31.2% of Mindarie residents declaring Anglicanism as their religion. Only 17.6% of the population declared no religion. Mindarie is rated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics' 2006 SEIFA index as a higher socio-economic area, with an index of 1121 (95th percentile) for overall relative advantage/disadvantage. This is consistent with the median individual income of $586 per week and the median household income of $1,522 per week, both substantially higher than the metropolitan Perth average of $513 and $1,086 respectively. A much greater percentage of Mindarie's residents (19.4%) worked as Technicians and Trades Workers compared to the regional average (16.0%), and the SEIFA data for Education/Occupation placed Mindarie in the 74th percentile. * Amenities and facilities Claytons Beach While Mindarie is a largely residential suburb, it does have a fairly large amount of infrastructure and amenities distributed at various points around the suburb. There are two minor shopping precincts in the northern and southern extremes of Mindarie, which include two service stations, various restaurants and take-away franchises (such as McDonald's and Red Rooster) and Basil's, an independent grocery store. Mindarie Keys Medical Centre, located in the south, provides medical care for the suburb's residents, as well as dental care and physiotherapy facilities. However, the large Ocean Keys Shopping Centre in Clarkson is situated adjacent to Mindarie on the other side of Marmion Avenue, catering to the suburb's residents for major commercial shopping needs and other public services. Unlike the adjacent Quinns Rocks coastline, Mindarie's coastline is mostly taken up by the Mindarie Marina and its large harbour and breakwater. The marina itself has been a popular destination for tourism since its inception in the late 1980s. Along the boardwalk, the marina contains a three-storey hotel overlooking the harbour, two restaurants, a microbrewery and The Boat, a pub and restaurant. The Boat provides the majority of Mindarie's entertainment and nightlife. Immediately south of the marina's breakwater is Claytons Beach, a small, unpatrolled beach that is a popular spot for surfers. The unoccupied bushland part of the beach, further south, runs through Tamala Park and into Burns Beach in the City of Joondalup. A vast number of parks and reserves are situated all around the suburb. Bellport Park contains tennis courts, while Lighthouse Park and Bellport Park both contain large, functional lighthouses. Along with the lime kilns in Coopers Park, they are considered local landmarks. Telephone services are provided by the Mindarie & Quinns Rocks telephone exchanges. The former exchange is located in the south-east of Mindarie, on Rothesay Heights. Education Mindarie is home to one K-6 primary school, Mindarie Primary School, which caters to the entire suburb. Senior Mindarie students are primarily in the catchment area for Clarkson Community High School. Students are also in catchment for Mindarie Senior College, built in the north of Mindarie in 2003, but the college caters for Years 11-12 only and chiefly accommodates leaving students from nearby Kinross College Years 7-10. Students in Mindarie also have the option of private Christian schools, of which the suburb has two - Peter Moyes Anglican Community School (established in 2000) and Quinns Baptist College (established in 1996.) Both schools take in students from Kindergarten to Year 12, and are located next to Mindarie Senior College in a strip along Mindarie's northern boundary. Transport Mindarie is linked to the rest of the Perth metropolitan area by Hester Avenue and Neerabup Road, which both interchange with the Mitchell Freeway and Wanneroo Road only a short drive to the east. The arterial highway Marmion Avenue also runs parallel to the freeway alongside Mindarie's suburb boundary, linking to Yanchep in the outer north. Anchorage Drive South, Rothesay Heights and Bellport Parade act as the main backbone distributor roads throughout Mindarie. Anchorage Drive was initially planned as the suburb's singular arterial ring road, entering Mindarie from Marmion Avenue in the south, looping through the suburb and exiting back onto Marmion Avenue 2 kilometres further north. However, the Mindarie Keys Joint Venture later decided against fully completing the road due to the barrier it presented to inland residents, instead landscaping 700 metres of the reserved road as part of the adjacent Lighthouse Park. Although the landscaped parkland section is still gazetted as a road reserve, traffic studies performed on behalf of the City of Wanneroo in 2001 showed no need for the road to be completed. =Public transport= Mindarie is served by the 481 and 482 bus routes to Clarkson railway station, a hub that provides further bus and rail links to the nearby regional city of Joondalup, as well as the rest of the Perth metropolitan area. A deviation of the 481 also directly serves the marina on weekends. * 481 - Clarkson to Quinns Rocks (south) via Mindarie * 482 - Clarkson to Quinns Rocks (north) via Mindarie Politics Mindarie contains one polling booth at Mindarie Primary School. It was historically part of the Electoral district of Wanneroo before becoming a member of Mindarie at the 2003 redistribution. It also forms the northern boundary of the Federal Division of Moore. Election results in Mindarie are unusual as they show strong support for the Liberal Party at both levels of government. This pattern is not shared by any of its neighbouring suburbs, such as Merriwa or Quinns Rocks, that consistently vote Liberal at Federal elections and the Australian Labor Party at state elections. This is often attributed to Mindarie's reasonably affluent coastal part in the west, while the east is predominantly \\"mortgage belt\\" families, in line with other surrounding areas.

History Prior to European settlement, the Noongar people had lived in the area for more than 40,000 years, taking advantage of the abundant food and water around the chain of wetlands on the coastal plain. In winter, they moved eastwards away from coastal weather, to return in summer as inland supplies dried up. The Mooro people (led by elder Yellagonga during the early years of European settlement) stretched from the Moore River near Guilderton to what is now the Perth central business district, and used to move between Lakes Joondalup, Neerabup and Yanchep. In 1865, European settlers established the Aboriginal tracks as a stock route from Dongara to Fremantle, travelling along the west side of the lakes. Lake Neerabup was first recorded by surveyor J. Cowle in 1867, the name being a Noongar word which possibly means \\"swampy place\\" or \\"small basin\\". The part of the stock route between Joondalup and Yanchep is now part of the Yaberoo Budjara Heritage Trail, part of the Bicentennial Heritage Trails Network established in 1988. The area was often spelled Neerabub, especially by postal and telecommunications authorities, until as recently as the 1960s. It was approved as a suburb name in 1982. Geography Neerabup is bounded by Wattle Avenue to the north, the proposed Mitchell Freeway to the west, Pinjar Road to the east and Flynn Drive and Burns Beach Road to the south. Neerabup's population was not measured at the 2001 Australian census. Facilities Neerabup is a sparsely populated agricultural suburb. Several plant nurseries, a fruit and vegetable shop at Menchetti Road and the Neerabup Lake wetland are situated along Wanneroo Road. The western strip between Wanneroo Road and the proposed Mitchell Freeway is approximately the southern half of the Neerabup National Park. The area also contains a golf course, small wineries, a small industrial area on Flynn Drive and several sand and limestone quarries. Motorsport Two of Western Australia's premier motorsport facilities, Barbagallo Raceway and Wanneroo Kartway, are located in the suburb's northeast. Perth's major Motorcycle speedway, the short Pinjar Park Speedway, is also located in Neerabup. Transport Neerabup is not served by public transport.

It is the most effective form of reversible birth control with a one-year failure rate around 0.05%. It lasts at least three or four years with some data showing effectiveness for five years. The device is placed under the skin on the inner aspect of the non-dominant arm. Only providers who have completed specific training can place and remove the implant. Following removal, fertility quickly returns. Common side effects include menstrual changes including irregular bleeding, with approximately one third of women reporting no menstrual periods. It should not be used by anyone with current breast cancer. It is not recommended in people with liver disease.The etonogestrel implant is a type of long-acting reversible birth control. It works by stopping ovulation, thickening the mucus around the opening of the cervix, and altering the lining of the uterus. Etonogestrel implants were approved for medical use in Indonesia in 1998 and in the United States in 2006. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. Etonogestrel implants are approved in more than 90 countries and used by about three million women globally as of 2010. Medical uses Etonogestrel birth control implants are a type of long-acting reversible contraception, which has been shown to be one of the most effective form of birth control. The failure rate of the implants is 0.05% for both perfect use and typical use because the method requires no user action after placement. Studies of one type, which include over 2,467 women-years of exposure, found no pregnancies. Other studies have found some failures with this method, some attributed to failures of the method itself and others to improper placement, drug interactions, or conception prior to method insertion. In comparison, tubal sterilization has a failure rate of 0.5% and IUDs have a failure rate of 0.2–0.8%. A single implant is approved for three years with data showing effectiveness for five years. Side effects Irregular bleeding and spotting: Many women will experience some type of irregular, unpredictable, prolonged, frequent, or infrequent bleeding. Some women also experience amenorrhea. For some women, prolonged bleeding will decline after the first three months of use. However, other women may experience this bleeding pattern through all five years of use. While these patterns are not dangerous, they are the most common reason that women give for discontinuing the use of the implant. After removal, bleeding patterns return to previous patterns in most women. Insertion complications: Some minor side effects such as bruising, skin irritation, or pain around the insertion site are common. However, there are some rare complications that can occur, such as infection or expulsion. In some cases, a serious complication occurs when the provider fails to insert, and the rod is left in the inserter. An Australian study reported 84 pregnancies as a result of such failure. Migration: Although very rare, the rod can sometimes move slightly within the arm. This can make removal more difficult. It is possible that insertion in the same site as a previous implant increases the likelihood of migration. Rods can be located only through high-frequency ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It can be located using traditional X-ray or CT-scan because of the inclusion of barium sulphate. There have been rare reports of implants having reached the lung via the pulmonary artery. Correct subdermal insertion over the triceps muscle reduces the risk of these events. Possible weight gain: Some women may experience slight weight gain when using the implant. However, current studies are not conclusive because they do not compare the weight of women using implants with a control group of women not using the implant. The average increase in body weight in studies was less than 5 pounds (2,25 kg) over 2 years. Ovarian cysts: A small portion of women using implants and other contraceptive implants develop ovarian cysts. Usually these cysts will disappear without treatment. Drug interactions: Efavirenz appears to decrease etonogestrel levels and increase rates of undesired pregnancy among implant users. Pregnancy: it is recommended that implants be removed if a pregnancy does occur. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the implant has a negative effect on pregnancy or a developing fetus. Acne: Acne has been self-reported to be a side effect, and is listed as a side effect by the FDA. However, a study of users found that a majority of users with acne before their insertion reported that their acne had decreased, and only 16% of those who did not have acne before insertion developed acne. Other possible symptoms: Other symptoms that have been reported in trials of implants include headache, emotional lability, abdominal pain, loss of libido, and vaginal dryness. However, there have been no studies that conclusively determine that these symptoms are caused by the implant. =Contraindications= Women should not use implants if they: * Are, or think they are, pregnant * Are allergic to etonogestrel * Have vaginal bleeding that has not been explained * Have some forms of severe liver disease A full list of contraindications can be found in the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2015 and the CDC United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use 2016 Device description A removed rod Nexplanon/Implanon consists of a single rod made of ethylene vinylacetate copolymer that is 4 cm long and 2mm in diameter. It is similar to a matchstick in size. The rod contains 68 mg of etonogestrel (sometimes called 3-keto- destrogestrel), a type of progestin. Peak serum etonogestrel concentrations have been found to reach 781–894 pg/mL in the first few weeks, gradually decreasing to 192–261 pg/mL after 1 year, 154–194 pg/mL after 2 years, and 156–177 pg/mL after 3 years, maintaining ovulation suppression and contraceptive efficacy. Serum levels maintain relatively stable through 36 months, which implies that the method may be effective for longer than 3 years. Although not formally approved by the manufacturer for more than 3 years, studies have shown it remains a highly effective contraceptive for 5 years. It is a type of progestogen-only contraception. =Insertion and removal= Implantation of Implanon An experienced clinician must perform the insertion of implants to ensure proper insertion and minimize the risk of nerve damage or misplacement, which could result in pregnancy. Before insertion, the arm is washed with a cleaning solution and a local anesthetic is applied to the upper arm around the insertion area. A needle-like applicator is used to insert the rod under the skin into the subdermal tissue on the inner side of the arm posterior to the groove between the biceps and triceps muscles. The average time for insertion is 0.5 to 1 minute. A bandage should be kept on the insertion site for 24 hours afterwards. Bruising and mild discomfort are common after insertion. Serious insertion site complications such as infection can occur very rarely, in less than 1% of patients. If a woman receives an implant outside the first five days of her period, she should wait to have sex or use a backup method of contraception (such as a condom, female condom, diaphragm, sponge, or emergency contraception) for the following week after insertion to prevent pregnancy. However, if the implant is inserted during the first five days of a woman's period, she is protected for that cycle and beyond.Bedsider (2010). \\"Implant.\\" Retrieved from http://bedsider.org/methods/implant#how_to_tab on March 17, 2011. Removal of Implanon Implants can be removed at any time if pregnancy is desired. The rod must also be removed by an experienced clinician. At removal, a local anesthetic is again used around the implant area at the distal end. If the provider cannot feel the implant, imaging tests may be necessary to locate the rod before it can be removed. A small incision is made in the skin over the end of the implant site. In some cases, a fibrous sheath may have formed around the implant, in which case the sheath must be incised. The implant is removed using forceps. The removal procedure lasts, on average, 3 to 3.5 minutes. =Fertility after removal= Within a week of removal, the hormones from the device leave the body and etonogestrel is undetectable in most users. Most women will begin to ovulate within six weeks of removal. Fertility levels will return to what they were before implant insertion. Mechanism of action The mechanism of action of progestin only contraceptives depends on the progestin activity and dose. Intermediate dose progestin-only contraceptives, like Nexplanon or Implanon (and the progestin-only pill Cerazette) allow some follicular development but inhibit ovulation in almost all cycles as the primary mechanism of action. Ovulation was not observed in studies of Implanon in the first two years of use and only rarely in the third year with no pregnancies. A secondary mechanism of action is the progestogenic increase in cervical mucus viscosity which inhibits sperm penetration. Hormonal contraceptives also have effects on the endometrium that theoretically could affect implantation, however no scientific evidence indicates that prevention of implantation actually results from their use. History The possibility of the subdermal contraceptive implant began when silicone was discovered in the 1940s and found to be bio-compatible with the human body. In 1964, Folkman and Long published the first study demonstrating that such a rod could be used to deliver drugs. In 1966 Dziuk and Cook published a study that looked at release rates and suggested that the rods could be well suited for contraception. After a study that used implants with progestogens for contraception, the Population Council developed and patented Norplant and Jadelle. Norplant has six rods and is considered a first- generation implant. Jadelle (Norplant II), a two-rod implant, and other single rod implants that followed, were developed because of complications resulting from Norplant's 6-rod system. The Jadelle system contains two silicone rods mixed with levonorgestrel. In 1990 De Nijs patented a co-axial extrusion technique of ethylene vinylacetate copolymers and 3-keto-desogestrel (etonogestrel) for the preparation of long-acting contraceptive devices, such as Implanon, Nexplanon and Nuvaring. The single rods were less visible under the skin and used etonogestrel as opposed to levonorgestrel in the hopes that it would reduce side effects. Norplant was used internationally beginning in 1983 and was marketed in the United States and the United Kingdom in 1993. There were many complications associated with Norplant removal in the United States and it was taken off the market in 2002. Although Jadelle was approved by the FDA, it has never been marketed in the United States, but it is widely used in Africa and Asia. Implanon was first used in Indonesia in 1998 and approved for use in the United States in 2006. Nexplanon was developed to eliminate the problem of non-insertion and localization of Implanon by changing the inserter device and making the rod radiopaque. As of January 2012, Implanon is no longer being marketed and Nexplanon is the only available single-rod implant. Types Nexplanon and Implanon NXT are essentially identical to Implanon except Nexplanon and Implanon NXT have 15 mg of barium sulphate added to the core, so it is detectable by x-ray. Nexplanon and Implanon NXT also has a pre-loaded applicator for easier insertion.

The process relies heavily upon mathematical concepts and models that are theorized within a study of prior and posterior probabilities known as Bayesian Statistics. In robotics A Bayes filter is an algorithm used in computer science for calculating the probabilities of multiple beliefs to allow a robot to infer its position and orientation. Essentially, Bayes filters allow robots to continuously update their most likely position within a coordinate system, based on the most recently acquired sensor data. This is a recursive algorithm. It consists of two parts: prediction and innovation. If the variables are normally distributed and the transitions are linear, the Bayes filter becomes equal to the Kalman filter. In a simple example, a robot moving throughout a grid may have several different sensors that provide it with information about its surroundings. The robot may start out with certainty that it is at position (0,0). However, as it moves farther and farther from its original position, the robot has continuously less certainty about its position; using a Bayes filter, a probability can be assigned to the robot's belief about its current position, and that probability can be continuously updated from additional sensor information.  Model  The true state x is assumed to be an unobserved Markov process, and the measurements z are the observations of a Hidden Markov model (HMM). The following picture presents a Bayesian Network of a HMM. center Because of the Markov assumption, the probability of the current true state given the immediately previous one is conditionally independent of the other earlier states. :p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{x}_{k-1},\\\\textbf{x}_{k-2},\\\\dots,\\\\textbf{x}_0) = p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{x}_{k-1} ) Similarly, the measurement at the k-th timestep is dependent only upon the current state, so is conditionally independent of all other states given the current state. :p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{x}_k,\\\\textbf{x}_{k-1},\\\\dots,\\\\textbf{x}_{0}) = p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{x}_{k} ) Using these assumptions the probability distribution over all states of the HMM can be written simply as: :p(\\\\textbf{x}_0,\\\\dots,\\\\textbf{x}_k,\\\\textbf{z}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\textbf{z}_k) = p(\\\\textbf{x}_0)\\\\prod_{i=1}^k p(\\\\textbf{z}_i\\\\textbf{x}_i)p(\\\\textbf{x}_i\\\\textbf{x}_{i-1}). However, when using the Kalman filter to estimate the state x, the probability distribution of interest is associated with the current states conditioned on the measurements up to the current timestep. (This is achieved by marginalising out the previous states and dividing by the probability of the measurement set.) This leads to the predict and update steps of the Kalman filter written probabilistically. The probability distribution associated with the predicted state is the sum (integral) of the products of the probability distribution associated with the transition from the (k - 1)-th timestep to the k-th and the probability distribution associated with the previous state, over all possible x_{k-1}. : p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1}) = \\\\int p(\\\\textbf{x}_k  \\\\textbf{x}_{k-1}) p(\\\\textbf{x}_{k-1}  \\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1} ) \\\\, d\\\\textbf{x}_{k-1} The probability distribution of update is proportional to the product of the measurement likelihood and the predicted state. : p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k}) = \\\\frac{p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{x}_k) p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1})}{p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1})} \\\\propto p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{x}_k) p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1}) The denominator :p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1}) = \\\\int p(\\\\textbf{z}_k\\\\textbf{x}_k) p(\\\\textbf{x}_k\\\\textbf{z}_{1:k-1}) d\\\\textbf{x}_{k} is constant relative to x, so we can always substitute it for a coefficient \\\\alpha, which can usually be ignored in practice. The numerator can be calculated and then simply normalized, since its integral must be unity.  Applications  * Kalman filter, a recursive Bayesian filter for multivariate normal distributions * Particle filter, a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) based technique, which models the PDF using a set of discrete points * Grid-based estimators, which subdivide the PDF into a deterministic discrete grid Sequential Bayesian filtering Sequential Bayesian filtering is the extension of the Bayesian estimation for the case when the observed value changes in time. It is a method to estimate the real value of an observed variable that evolves in time. The method is named: ;filtering: when estimating the current value given past and current observations, ;smoothing: when estimating past values given past and current observations, and ;prediction: when estimating a probable future value given past and current observations. The notion of Sequential Bayesian filtering is extensively used in control and robotics.

Its northern and eastern boundaries are not gazetted.2007 StreetSmart directory, Department of Lands and Surveys, Perth, with info from Battye Library. Facilities Pinjar is a sparsely populated agricultural suburb, most of which is pine plantation and wetland. At the 2006 Australian census, Pinjar had a population of 78 people living in 39 dwellings. It was not measured in 2011. Motorsport Pinjar is home to the Wanneroo Raceway, a 2.411 km (1.498 mi) road racing circuit. The raceway which opened in 1969, is the home of motor racing in Western Australia and hosts an annual round of the V8 Supercars championship. Pinjar is also home to the Pinjar Park Speedway, which opened in 2005. Pinjar Park is a motorcycle speedway, and regularly hosts national and international meetings and caters to both senior and junior solo and sidecar racing. Pinjar Park is considered small for a speedway in Australia, with most tracks around the country ranging from to in length.

It is part of the City of Wanneroo local government area. The suburb was formerly established in 1962 as a rural townsite, focused around Quinns Beach, the area's main amenity. Geography Quinns Rocks is bounded by Mindarie to the south (Quinns Road), Merriwa and Butler to the east (Marmion Avenue) and Jindalee to the north (Hampshire Drive). West is the Indian Ocean and the coastline of Quinns Beach, which straddles the whole length of the suburb. History =Name= The suburb takes its name from the offshore reef first noted during a coastline traverse by Assistant Surveyor James Cowle in 1867. Cowle was continuing a survey begun by Robert Quin, who had reached a spot about 4 kilometres south-east of the rocks in 1866. Although the modern-day name is spelt with a double \\"n\\", the rocks are thought to have been named after Quin, who emigrated to Western Australia in 1863, where he was appointed as an Assistant Surveyor on his arrival. He occupied this position for 22 years, carrying out most of his surveys in the Gingin-Moore River area, until his death in July 1886. The general area on the coast opposite the rocks was referred to as Quinns Rocks by the Wanneroo Road Board when they requested the survey of a road that led there in November 1925. Later, the place also came to be called \\"Wanneroo Beach\\". An alternate origin of the name is after Mick Quinn, a sheep tender who worked for the Mindarie Pastoral Company in the early 1900s. =Residential development= In 1930, the whole beachfront came under the control of the Wanneroo Road Board, which issued \\"boatshed and campsite permits\\" to holidaymakers at a rental of $4.20 per annum. Early shack owners were restricted to no more than 48 hours in their shacks at one time without further permission from the Road Board. The first permanent residents appear to have been in 1942. The caravan park was built at the south end here in 1946. Mr L.G. Leppinus, formerly of Merredin, was one of the seven original shack owners at this site; he had to move his shack three times because of extensive erosion. Shack owners put down their own bores and usually ran on pan system toilets. During the 1950s, an increasing number of shacks lined the ocean front. Leasing of the beachfront reserve was phased out towards the end of that decade. Shack owners were told they had to remove their shacks, but were given first right of refusal for blocks on the ocean front - the going rate was approximately 400 pounds (A$800).\\"A History of Quinns Rocks\\" by Barbara Arthur & Betty Hunt-Smith In 1958, Lot 223 was purchased and subdivided the following year. Four applications to build were approved in March 1959 and a major sale on 10 June saw nearly 300 blocks purchased. The subdivision was extended northwards in the early 1960s and Quinns Rocks was declared a townsite under the Local Government Act on 27 July 1962. Further extensions took place in 1964 and 1972. The locality encompassing this local government townsite, gazetted as \\"Quinns\\" in 1974 for future postal services, was changed to Quinns Rocks in 1977, so as to coincide with the townsite name. The beachfront area comprising the original townsite of Quinns, up until the 1990s, is colloquially known as \\"Old Quinns\\". The area is characterized by rolling hills and roads, overhead power lines on wooden poles, few pavements and many unique houses with distinct architectural designs dating from the 1960s and 1970s. Most of this area still relies on septic tanks for waste management rather than a linked sewerage system, although infill sewerage works are scheduled in future. Norfolk Estate was built in Quinns Rocks much later in the early 1990s in the area east of Tapping Way. It is distinguished from \\"Old Quinns\\" by underground power lines, cul-de-sac street systems and modern bungalow housing. The estate also contains a higher concentration of public housing. The final part of Quinns, known simply as \\"Quinns Beach\\", was the final portion of the area to be developed, and borders Jindalee in the north. Demographics Quinns Rocks had a population of 7,991 at the 2006 census, an increase of over 1,988 residents since the 2001 census. The population is predicted to continue growing in the future, albeit at a slow pace.City of Wanneroo Population and Household Forecasts - Quinns Rocks , .id Only 57.7% of Quinns Rocks residents were born in Australia, compared to 70.9% nationally. All major immigrant groups in Quinns are from Anglophone countries (e.g. United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand) with 19.7% of the population born in the UK, a figure in line with neighbouring suburbs that also share significant British populations, such as Mindarie. Quinns residents are generally young, with a median age of 31 compared to 37 nationally. Income levels are also substantially above the national average, with an average household income of $1,245 per week, compared to $1,171 per week nationally. 47.3% of residents identified as Christian, through various Christian denominations, the most populous being Anglicanism at 24.2%. Two churches in southern Quinns serve the Christian population, Anglican Church of Australia and Northside Baptist Church. 26.7% declared no religion. Amenities and facilities Quinns Beach, looking south onto Mindarie. The major attraction of Quinns Rocks is Quinns Beach, which spans the entire western boundary of the suburb along Ocean Drive, one of the area's main backbone roads. The beach contains barbecue facilities and children's play areas for families, as well as a dedicated dog beach further north, for dog-walkers. A beachside cafe and bottle shop are situated on Ocean Drive. The beach is also home to the clubrooms of the Quinns Mindarie Surf Lifesaving Club, who have patrolled the beach since the club's foundation in 1982. There are over ten large parks and reserves scattered throughout Quinns Rocks. Many of these parks share an abundance of sporting facilities for residents, such as the Quinns Rocks Bowling Club, the McCoy Park BMX tracks, the Quinns Rocks Skate Park and the Gumblossom Tennis Courts. The tennis courts are located at Gumblossom Park, the site of the Gumblossom Community Centre, which provides for most community functions and gatherings in the suburb. Quinns Rocks is largely residential, relying on Clarkson and the nearby city of Joondalup for major commercial and public services. Nonetheless, it does have the Quinns Village Shopping Centre, a small shopping precinct in the south-east. Located here is an IGA supermarket, serving as the suburb's main shopping centre for groceries, as well as a licensed post office and newsagent, a pharmacy, a bottleshop and a petrol station. A majority of the area's telephone services are provided by the Quinns Rocks telephone exchange, located in the extreme south of the suburb along Quinns Road.ADSL2+ for QUINNS ROCKS (WA) Exchange The remaining one-third of houses in the suburb's north are provided for by the Jindalee telephone exchange, located in adjacent suburb Butler to the north-east on Marmion Avenue.ADSL2+ for JINDALEE (WA) Exchange Education Quinns Rocks contains two K-6 primary schools - Quinns Rocks Primary School and Quinns Beach Primary School, located in the southern and northern extremes of the suburb respectively. Senior Quinns Rocks students fall into Clarkson Community High School, Butler College and Kinross High School catchment area. There are a number of other senior colleges in close proximity to the area for Quinns students, including Mindarie Senior College, Peter Moyes Anglican Community School and Quinns Baptist College, which all straddle the Mindarie-Quinns southern boundary. Transport Ocean Drive Quinns Rocks is serviced by road through Marmion Avenue, a major north-south arterial road linking the suburb to the rest of the Perth metropolitan area to the south, as well as the far outer suburb of Yanchep in the north. Quinns Road formerly linked the suburb directly to Wanneroo Road in the east, but the road east of Quinns Rocks was split and realigned as Hester Avenue. There are three main, backbone distributor roads throughout Quinns. Quinns Road/Ocean Drive follows the entire southern and western perimeter of the suburb along the coastline. Tapping Way broadly divides Old Quinns and the Norfolk Estate in an approximately south-eastern to north-western manner, while Santa Barbara Parade strictly serves the eastern, inland part of the suburb. =Public transport= Clarkson railway station serves as the nearest major transport hub to Quinns, providing rail links to Joondalup and Perth's central business district.

There were initially two polling booths in the area, at Gumblossom Community Centre and Quinns Beach Primary School, but these were amalgamated into one for the 2008 state election. The suburb was formerly part of the electoral district of Wanneroo before becoming a member of Mindarie at the 2003 redistribution. It also forms the southern boundary of the federal Division of Pearce. Like many neighbouring \\"mortgage belt\\" suburbs, Quinns residents support the Australian Labor Party at state level, while voting for the Liberal Party at federal level. The Liberal Party has consistently enjoyed a margin of approximately 20% more votes than the ALP at federal elections since 2004. A characteristic of residents' votes in Quinns is their support for The Greens, which has been constantly increasing at each election.

At the time, only south Ridgewood was populated, containing the \\"Carnegie Private Estate\\" that was built in the mid-1990s. The estate had a small population of 968. There were campaigns for Ridgewood's separation from Merriwa as far back as 1994, not long after the Carnegie Estate had been built by developers Town and Country Holdings. The developers lodged a request with the City of Wanneroo to bifurcate the area from Merriwa and rename the new locality \\"Carnegie\\", after the estate, which in turn was named in honour of David Carnegie, one of the earliest explorers of Western Australia.

It sits on the border between the City of Wanneroo and the City of Joondalup local authorities, and separates the Clarkson-Butler region from the suburbs of Joondalup.  History  The Mooro group of Noongar were familiar with the area, and several of their traditional stories and legends refer to local Tamala Park land features, such as Waukolup Hill, although evidence suggests that they lived much further east, closer to modern-day Wanneroo Road. The suburb was formally established by excision of parts of Mindarie, Clarkson and Burns Beach on 9 September 1988.  Present use  At present, Tamala Park is mostly unoccupied bushland, primarily used as a landfill and recycling centre. Two arterial roads, Marmion Avenue and Connolly Drive, run through it and link the suburbs on each side. It is a large locality, extending from the Joondalup railway line in the east, to the coast of the Indian Ocean, where it leads onto Burns Beach to the south and Claytons Beach in Mindarie to the north. Tamala Park is in the process of being developed. The Tamala Park Regional Council (TPRC) was established to develop of land in the Tamala Park locality. The Council comprises 12 councillors representing the 7 owner councils that make up the TPRC as follows: * Town of Cambridge * City of Joondalup * City of Perth * City of Stirling * City of Wanneroo * Town of Victoria Park * City of Vincent Tamala Park is the 10th regional and 154th local government council to be established by proclamation in the Government Gazette in February 2006.

The song was simple, at its core effectively the repetition of one melody over a descending D-A-G chord progression. The group found difficulty deciding on an arrangement, and many different versions of the song were recorded before the group finally decided on the slow-paced version that appeared on the album. On this final version Young was in the foreground, singing the verses and the chorus with his bandmates providing the \\"helpless\\" refrain, while the instrumentation came in the form of acoustic guitar, electric guitar (with volume pedal and tremolo), piano, bass and drums. It became one of the most revered songs from the Déjà Vu album (Q magazine's Peter Doggett regards it as \\"one of (the album's) showpieces\\"), and has remained a live favorite of Young's for over forty years. An alternate mix of the CSNY version was released on Neil Young's The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972. It features Young playing harmonica and electronically treated percussion. Young played the song with The Band in the group's final concert with its original lineup, on American Thanksgiving Day 1976 at San Francisco's Winterland Ballroom, with Joni Mitchell providing backing vocals offstage. The performance was featured in the Martin Scorcese concert film The Last Waltz. The \\"town in North Ontario\\" referred to in the opening line of the song is often presumed to be Ontario native Young's hometown; Young himself cleared up the rumors in a 1995 Mojo interview with Nick Kent: :\\"Well, it's not literally a specific town so much as a feeling. Actually, it's a couple of towns. Omemee, Ontario, is one of them. It's where I first went to school and spent my 'formative' years. Actually I was born in Toronto...\\" Omemee lies just west of Peterborough and 128 km (approx. 80 miles) northeast of Toronto.

Meskel occurs on the 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or on September 28 in leap years). \\"Meskel\\" (or \\"Meskal\\" or \\"Mesqel\\", there are various ways to transliterate from Ge'ez to Latin script) is Ge'ez for \\"cross\\". The festival is known as Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in other Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant churches. The churches that follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate the feast yearly on September 14. The feast is held in Meskel Square, named after the festival, in the capital city of Addis Ababa. Religious and civil leaders preside over the celebration, and public figures give speeches and reference biblical themes and stories. Many Ethiopians who live in cities return to their villages to celebrate the national event. When it gets darker, the Demera is burned.Thomas M Landy, \\"Meskel\\", Catholics & Cultures updated June 19, 2015 Overview The Meskel celebration includes the burning of a large bonfire, or Demera, based on the belief that Queen Eleni, as she is known, had a revelation in a dream. She was told that she should make a bonfire and that the smoke would show her where the True Cross was buried. So she ordered the people of Jerusalem to bring wood and make a huge pile. After adding frankincense to it the bonfire was lit and the smoke rose high up to the sky and returned to the ground, exactly to the spot where the Cross had been buried. According to local traditions, this Demera-procession takes place in the early evening the day before Meskel or on the day itself. The firewood is decorated with daisies prior to the celebration. Charcoal from the remains of the fire is afterwards collected and used by the faithful to mark their foreheads with the shape of a cross (compare Ash Wednesday). Edward Ullendorff records a number of beliefs of the meaning of Demera, with some believing that it \\"marks the ultimate act in the cancellation of sins, while others hold that the direction of the smoke and the final collapse of the heap indicate the course of future events – just as the cloud of smoke the Lord raised over the Tabernacle offered guidance to the children of Israel (Exod. 40:34–38).\\"Ullendorff, p. 114 Demera engulfed in flames, 2013 One explanation for the high rank this festival has in the church calendar is that it is believed that a part of the true Cross has been brought to Ethiopia from Egypt. It is said to be kept at Amba Geshen, which itself has a cross-shaped plan. According to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, the discovery of the True Cross is traditionally believed to have been in March, but Meskel was moved to September to avoid holding a festival during Lent, and because the church commemorating the True Cross in Jerusalem was dedicated during September. Ullendorff speculates that Meskel replaced an older festival, with pagan and Hebraic associations, which he believes received its Christian sanction around the reign of Emperor Amda Seyon in the fourteenth century. \\"The most ancient meaning of these feasts – as was also the case in Israel – was no doubt seasonal: the month of Maskaram marked the end of the rains, the resumption of work, and the reopening of communications.\\" Notes References * Ullendorff, Edward (1968) Ethiopia and the Bible, Schweich lectures series, Oxford University Press for the British Academy, External links *Festival and Holidays on the website of the Embassy of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia in the United Kingdom, with a section on \\"Meskel – The Finding of the True Cross\\" Category:Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Category:Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church Category:Christian festivals and holy days Category:Christian festivals Category:September observances ","title":"Meskel"},{"id":"2591449","text":"Time of the Wolf () is a 2003 French dystopian post-apocalyptic drama film written and directed by Austrian director Michael Haneke.

Established on 12 January 1953, the school was the first post-war government English girls' school built in colonial Singapore. History Tanjong Katong Girls' School (TKGS) was established on 12 January 1953 with seven classes, 250 pupils, and ten teaching staff. The school was the first post-war government English girls' school built in colonial Singapore. TKGS was first opened on 12 January 1953, with seven classes. That same year, the school began admitting selected Chinese school students. In 1955, new science laboratories were constructed. TKGS became a double-session school in 1960 to cater to the increased enrollment of 1,200. It was also the year Mrs Maude Scott, founding Principal of TKGS, was succeeded by Miss See Tin See. TKGS became an integrated school in 1962, with the Chinese language. Since its establishment, TKGS has hosted trainees from the Teachers' Training Course (TTC), and has served as a workshop for Home Economics students. In the late 1970s, TKGS conducted \\"immersion programmes\\" for students from the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools, where students who had a Chinese medium of language were exposed to English lessons in an English environment. TKGS served as a Music Elective Programme (MEP) centre for students who were taking music as an 'O' Level subject but whose schools did not have suitable facilities. In January 1966, the school was expanded to include another 4-storey block which housed Science laboratories, classrooms and special rooms. A new cookery room was added to the domestic Science block and the canteen was extended to cater to the increased number of students. In 1967, the first Pre-University classes were started, boosting the student enrollment to 2,000. In 1972, TKGS won the champion title at the School Band Competition, and clinched the title at the Inter-School Debate Series in 1973. In 1975, TKGS produced the top girl in the Singapore GCE 'O' Level Examination. In 1983, TKGS was selected by the Ministry of Education (MOE) for the Music Elective Programme (MEP), and was one of the four schools in Singapore to offer music as an examinable 'O' Level subject. The Pre-University programme was stopped in 1993 in line with MOE policy. In 1995, the school moved to a new campus at Dunman Lane, though the official opening only took place in 1997. The landmark sculpture, the \\"Spirit of TKGS\\", was commissioned and unveiled by the then Minister of Education, Mr Teo Chee Hean, during the school's official opening. Other achievements include gaining autonomous status and the conversion to a. TKGS curriculum includes all the pure Sciences, humanities and aesthetics. It is also one of the few schools in Singapore to offer Economics as an examinable 'O' Level subject, and at the first Cambridge GCE 'O' Level Economics Examination in 2008, TKGS produced the top Economics students in Singapore. Class periods were extended to 50 minutes in 2003, and in 2005, TKGS announced that it would be one of the first schools in Singapore to offer Drama as an examinable 'O' Level subject. The LEGACY (Leading, Empowering, Guiding, Affirming and Challenging Youths) Programme was introduced as part of the Integrated Character Development Programme as well, consisting of classroom and experiential learning of moral education during curriculum time. Another initiative was the Multi-Disciplinary Project Work for the Secondary 2s, with Future Problem Solving at the core of its framework. The Chinese Special Programme (CSP) and the Malay Special Programme (MSP) were introduced for students in Malay and Chinese respectively to learn the other language. In 2007, TKGS was appointed the East Zone Centre of Excellence (COE) for English Language, in recognition of its innovative approach towards the teaching and learning of English and the students' consistently good performance in English at the GCE 'O' Level examinations. TKGS now has an enrollment of 1,388 students and around 120 staff, and offers all the Pure Sciences, Economics, Drama, and Music in addition to the normal curriculum. It offers the Music Elective Programme and the Drama Elective Programme. Every pupil is required to participate in at least one core co-curricular activity. Girls who desire to serve the school may participate in the optional non-core CCAs. TKGS is partnered with the Thai girls' school, Satri Si Suriyothai School in the Singapore-Thailand Enhanced Partnership (STEP) Programme. Students with good academic results from the People's Republic of China, Brunei and the ASEAN region are also invited to join the school. The current principal of TKGS is Ms Chew Ing Lim, who succeeds Mrs Mary Seah, current principal of School of the Arts, Singapore.  Academic Information  TKGS is one of the few schools in Singapore that offer the Music Elective Programme (MEP) to students who wish to pursue Music as a subject in the Cambridge 'O' Level examinations.

The phrase \\"sheltered instruction,\\" original concept, and underlying theory of comprehensible input are all credited to Stephen Krashen. The dual goals of sheltered instruction are: # to provide access to mainstream, grade-level content, and # to promote the development of English language proficiency. Definition Sheltered Instruction, also referred to as SDAIE in California, is a teaching style founded on the concept of providing meaningful instruction in the content areas (social studies, math, science) for transitioning Limited English Proficient (LEP) students towards higher academic achievement while they reach English fluency. This method type is often used in mainstream secondary classrooms where the students have a foundation of English education. A variety of instruction is used including the theories of Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. Instead of providing watered down curriculum for LEP student, sheltered instruction allows for the content to be equal to that of native English speakers while improving their grasp of the language. The teacher provides varied methods of instruction that allow students to create meaning of multifaceted content in classroom discussion, activities, reading and writing. Teachers call on a number of different instruction methods such as the use of socialization practices to allow the content to be more accessible. The differences between ESL instruction and the use of sheltered instruction or SDAIE is that sheltered instruction does not focus entirely on language development; instead, through various other topics or actual content material in the curriculum, English proficiency is achieved. (work is copyrighted and cannot be copied) Originally the intent of sheltered instruction was for students with a relatively strong grasp of the English language but lacking in writing and reading abilities. Since then the need for proficient teachers capable of sheltered instruction has increased. The ESL certified teachers and programs have decreased due to new legislation, but the number of LEP students is rising causing teachers to build upon their abilities to take on the linguistically diverse classroom. Teacher Preparation As in any instructional approach, the use of sheltered instruction is effective when the teacher is capable of administering the lessons effectively, although the causal direction of this tautologous observation is not clear. If the lesson is administered effectively, then, by definition, the teacher is capable of administering it effectively, but if it is not administered effectively, then it cannot be determined whether this is due to teacher factors or methodological weakness. Without a far more rigorous evaluation, the claim that this is a viable approach cannot be confirmed because it is assumed that any problems arise from teacher factors, not methodological weakness. Many pre-service teacher programs are working to equip teachers with the skills they need to be successful. Beginning with pre- service teachers achieving a strong foundation of cultural psychology, language theory and acquisition as well as certified content knowledge in their undergraduate major, the courses incorporate multiple field experiences as well as pedagogical methods and cultural diversity instruction. There are many alternative ways teachers can learn how to increase effectiveness of instructional delivery and create a culturally responsive classroom, including online resources. Some U.S. public schools receive Title III funding to help pay for these preparation courses. Title III is the part of the No Child Left Behind Act that authorizes funds for English Language acquisition programs, including Professional development for educators. Strategies Since the basis of sheltered instruction or SDAIE is to provide a framework for language development then one of the simplest ways follow a set format of instruction. For example, beginning each lesson with an introductory activity that assesses the students’ knowledge in a non-threatening and non-graded format will allow the teacher to evaluate the students’ skill set. It is vitally important the teacher designs his/her lessons to clearly define language and content as well as make the activity meaningful through the linkage to past knowledge and present and supplemental materials. Some examples of lessons include hands-on and cooperative learning activities, vocabulary, and the use of visual clues. Teachers also place an emphasis on developing the students’ habits of organization and study skills. Teachers may use sheltered instruction within a variety of program models (e.g., immersion, pull out, team-teaching). Teachers may use sheltered instruction in a mainstream class to support English language learners, or a class may be specially designed, such as \\"Sheltered U.S. History.\\" \\"Many ELLs are also refugees\\", thus sheltered instruction can be one of the useful strategies for their instruction. (work is copyrighted and cannot be copied) The teacher should \\"speak more clearly and slowly\\", use more graphics and similar \\"multimodal\\" instructional tools, and speak using shorter \\"sentences and clauses.\\" Such classes may include only English language learners, or \\"linguistically diverse\\" language learners and English- fluent peers. According to Michael Genzuk, SDAIE strategies typically include: * Increase wait time, be patient. Give your students time to think and process the information before you provide answers. A student may know the answers but need more processing time in order to say it in English. * Respond to the student's message, don't correct errors (Expansion). If a student has the correct answer and it is understandable, don't correct his or her grammar. The exact word and correct grammatical response will develop with time. Instead, repeat his or her answer, putting it into standard English, use positive reinforcement techniques. * Simplify teacher language. Speak directly to the student, emphasizing important nouns and verbs, using as few extra words as possible. Repetition and speaking louder doesn't help; rephrasing, and body language does. * Don't force oral production. Instead, give the student an opportunity to demonstrate his or her comprehension and knowledge through body actions, drawing pictures, manipulating objects, or pointing. Speech will emerge. * Demonstrate, use visuals and manipulatives. Whenever possible, accompany your message with gestures, pictures, and objects that help get the meaning across. Use a variety of different pictures or objects for the same idea. Give an immediate context for new words. Understanding input is the key to language acquisition. * Make lessons sensory activities. Give students a chance to touch, listen, smell and taste when possible. Talk about the words that describe these senses as students physically experiences lesson. Write new words as well as say them. * Pair or group students with native speakers. Much of a student's language acquisition comes from interacting with peers. Give students tasks to complete that require interaction of each member of the group, but arrange it so that the student has linguistically easier tasks. Utilize cooperative learning techniques in a student-centered classroom. * Adapt the materials to student's language level, maintain content integrity. Don't “water down” the content. Rather, make the concepts more accessible and comprehensible by adding pictures, charts, maps, time-lines, and diagrams, in addition to simplifying the language. * Increase your knowledge. Learn as much as you can about the language and culture of your students. Go to movies, read books, look at pictures of the countries. Keep the similarities and differences in mind and then check your knowledge by asking your students whether they agree with your impressions. Learn as much of the student's language as you can; even a few words help. * Build on the student's prior knowledge. Find out as much as you can about how the ideas and concepts you are teaching build upon the student's previous knowledge or previous way of being taught. Encourage the students to point out differences and connect similarities. * Support the student's home language and culture; bring it into the classroom. An important goal should be to encourage the students to keep their home languages as they also acquire English. Let students help bring about a multicultural perspective to the subjects you are teaching. Encourage students to bring in pictures, poems, dances, proverbs, or games. Encourage students to bring these items in as part of the subject you are teaching, not just as a separate activity. Do whatever you can to help your fluent English- speaking students see all students as knowledgeable persons from a respected culture. Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol The Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol is a research-based observation instrument that is used to measure sheltered instruction. This is a concept-based methodology in teacher training, also called SIOP, which is used to measure a teacher's effectiveness in the classroom. It is \\"one approach teachers use to help ELLs,\\" or English Language Learners. SIOP uses several related activities to accomplish the goal of second-language acquisition, including lesson plans, background, 'comprehensible input', strategies, interaction, practice/application, lesson delivery, and review and assessment.

Career Payne was born in the south side of Glasgow, and was educated at Woodfarm High School. He was also a member of the local 28th Glasgow (Giffnock) Scout Group in his youth. He went on to become a student at the Glasgow School of Art, where he met the band's singer, Fran Healy. They teamed up to form Glass Onion (named after a Beatles' song), later renaming themselves Travis. Originally Payne was not part of Glass Onion, which featured two other members, but when they left he was asked to play for the band. At the time of being asked, Payne had never touched a bass guitar in his life; for weeks he refused to do it, until finally he agreed. Although he is better known for his bass guitar playing, vocals and chirpy grins in his many photo shoots, Payne has written songs of his own. Tracks such as \\"The Score\\", \\"Know Nothing\\" and \\"Good for Nothing\\" were all penned by Payne and have featured as b-sides on the band's more recent singles. Payne also sings lead vocals on some b-sides, for example \\"A Little Bit of Soul\\", the reverse flip of \\"Flowers in the Window\\", and also on \\"The Distance\\" from Singles. He has also written the song \\"Colder\\" which features on The Boy With No Name and three of the songs from the sixth album Ode to J. Smith, including single Something Anything, which is the first Travis single not to be written by Fran Healy. Payne also played bass on much of The Divine Comedy album Victory for the Comic Muse and appeared as a backing vocalist on the song Tumble and Fall from Feeder's album Pushing the Senses.  Personal life  Payne was married to actress Kelly Macdonald in 2003. They separated in 2017. In November 2007, it was announced on the Travisonline message board that Payne was to become a father for the first time, making him the last member of Travis to do so.

It is part of the City of Wanneroo local government area. It is a predominantly residential suburb, containing two RAAF retirement villages. History =Name= The name \\"Hester\\" was originally approved for the suburb by the Shire of Wanneroo in 1980, after Thomas Hester, one of the first land owners in the vicinity. The neighbouring suburbs of Clarkson and Butler were also named this way. However, the name was opposed by Australia Post due to conflict with the already-existing town of Hester in south-west WA. \\"Merriwa\\", an Aboriginal word meaning \\"a good place\\", was then proposed and approved for the area within the same year. The original name survives in Hester Avenue, an east-west arterial road that forms the southern boundary of the suburb. A town also named Merriwa exists in New South Wales. The Geographical Names Board of New South Wales lists an alternate meaning for its name, as \\"plenty of grass seed and flour made from it\\". View westwards along Seagrove Boulevard. =Suburban development= Up until the late 1980s, Merriwa was unpopulated bushland with no notable land features other than Quinns Road, a two-lane arterial road linking the adjacent townsite of Quinns Rocks to Wanneroo Road. The original Quinns Beach Estate in the south of Merriwa was developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Smith Corporation, who were also responsible for the development of the marina in nearby Mindarie at the time. Many early residents of Merriwa suffered from lack of facilities, poorly built pavements and roads, lack of street-lighting and isolation from other areas (as Marmion Avenue had not yet been extended.) This led to the formation of the Merriwa Development Committee, with the purpose of lobbying the Council to support the issues raised. Carnegie Private Estate was then built in the mid 1990s in the area east of Connolly Drive by Town and Country Bank. In 1998, Merriwa was bifurcated along Connolly Drive by the City of Wanneroo, and the eastern half, including the Carnegie Estate, was gazetted as the new suburb of Ridgewood. Seagrove Estate in the north was built much later in the early 2000s by Caversham Property, and is delineated from the Quinns Beach Estate by the Grand Paradiso Parade and Seagrove Boulevard roads. This development was also supported by a \\"Merriwa Structure Plan\\" devised by the City of Wanneroo, to provide adequate services and public open space for residents of the area. Two RAAF retirement villages, Merriwa Estate and Cambrai Village, are also located in the northern and southern extremes of the suburb. Geography Merriwa is bounded by Butler to the north (Lukin Drive), Ridgewood to the east (Connolly Drive), Quinns Rocks and Mindarie to the west (Marmion Avenue) and Clarkson to the south (Hester Avenue). The suburb was originally much larger, extending to the Joondalup railway line reserve in the east, but was split in two in 1998. It is from Quinns Beach and the Indian Ocean to the west. Demographics Merriwa had a population of 5,220 at the 2006 Australian census, an increase of 1,167 people since the 2001 census. However, the suburb's population is predicted to remain stable in the future.City of Wanneroo Population and Household Forecasts – Merriwa (PDF) , .id Although Merriwa's 64.2% Australian-born population is below the national average of 70.9%, it is still significantly higher than all adjoining suburbs, which have important British-born populations. Correspondingly, Merriwa's British-born population are a minority at 14.2%. The median age of Merriwa's residents is 33, compared to the national Australian average of 37. Median incomes in the area were considerably below the Australian average, with an average household income of $808 per week compared to $1,027 nationally. The most popular religion in the suburb is Christianity, comprising 48.6% of the population across various Christian denominations. However, more residents declared no religion (26.8%) than they did for the most popular Christian denomination, Anglicanism (23.3%.) There is one Pentecostal church, One Church, located in the Seagrove area of the suburb. Amenities and facilities Merriwa is primarily residential, but does contain some shopping and retail facilities. It relies on Clarkson and the nearby regional city of Joondalup for most other commercial and public services. The Merriwa Plaza, within the Quinns Beach Estate area, accommodates a major Supa IGA supermarket branch, two bottle shops, a Chicken Treat branch and Metro Hardware, a local hardware store. In the north is a Puma service station, along with several other small shops and take-away restaurants. Near the Supa IGA is TheSixty30 formally known as the Merriwa Tavern, a pub and restaurant that serves as the hub for nightlife in the suburb. Six large parks are scattered throughout the suburb, many with additional sporting facilities. Addison Park features clubrooms and a function hall, while Dalvik Park leads onto the Alkimos Baptist College campus. Also nearby is the Jenolan Way Community Centre that is used for its function rooms and offices. Brighton Beach Medical Centre in northern Merriwa provides medical services to the suburb's residents. Within the vicinity is a St John ambulance station, opened in 2008. The station operates 24 hours a day and serves all surrounding suburbs from Kinross to Butler. Telephone services are provided by the Quinns Rocks telephone exchange.ADSL2+ for QUINNS ROCKS (WA) Exchange Education Merriwa contains one primary school, Merriwa Primary School, catering for the whole suburb from Kindergarten to Year 7. Located on the same campus is the Merriwa Education Support Centre, specializing in education for intellectually disabled children. Senior Merriwa students from Year 8 onwards fall into the Clarkson Community High School catchment area. A private school is also located on Dalvik Park in the centre of the suburb, which was known as Kingsway Christian College up until 2007 when it closed down. The campus remained vacant for the next three years until re-opening as Alkimos Baptist College, a private Baptist primary school for children from Kindergarten to Year 8. The staff and students of the college are expected to eventually move to a brand new, purpose-built facility in Alkimos in the future. Transport Merriwa is linked by road to Perth by Marmion Avenue and Connolly Drive, two parallel arterial roads that run along Merriwa's western and eastern boundaries respectively. Hester Avenue in the south of Merriwa also links directly to Wanneroo Road in the east. There is one backbone road, Baltimore Parade, that cuts through the middle of Merriwa from north to south and links the whole suburb together. The road originally looped westwards onto Marmion Avenue, but was re-aligned during the development of the Seagrove Estate to exit north onto Lukin Drive instead. The old alignment of the road was renamed Hughie Edwards Drive. Cars are the preferred mode of transport in Merriwa, due to its outer-suburban location past the terminus of the Joondalup railway line. The nearest railway station to Merriwa is Clarkson station immediately south, which provides a rail link to the Perth CBD via the Joondalup line. The suburb is also served by the 483 bus route, running from Butler to Clarkson railway station.Northern 78 timetable (PDF) , Transperth, effective 6 February 2011. * 483 – Clarkson to Butler (west) via Merriwa Politics Merriwa contains one polling booth at Merriwa Primary School. There is a strong trend for Merriwa residents to vote for the Australian Labor Party at State level and the Liberal Party at Federal level, in line with other \\"mortgage belt\\" suburbs in the area, such as Clarkson. The Family First Party is also generally preferred over the Christian Democratic Party at minority level. Merriwa was historically part of the Electoral district of Wanneroo before becoming a member of Mindarie at the 2003 redistribution. It also forms the southern boundary of the Federal Division of Pearce.

However the performance is also routinely played at other Chinese festivals. The stage setup is usually composed of temporary structures and situated in the suburbs of the city in any empty field or even in parking spaces or housing estate. In the past, live performances at festivals were usually of Chinese operas or puppet shows. The performances are meant to be for the spirits but also for people during the seventh month. With the decline of Chinese opera and traditional puppet shows as popular entertainment, these public performances evolved to become what is known today as Getai. The backdrop of the stage is usually made of cardboard and clothes painted in bright colours, vibrantly illuminated by coloured spotlights. The performers normally don loud and glittery clothing.Foreigners invade getai, The Straits Times, Aug 23, 2009 Some getai hosts indulge in crude humour; others maintain a quick-witted dialogue, joking about local and current affairs, sometimes switching between Mandarin, local Chinese dialects, and even English and Indian languages. Younger people in Singapore may relate to Getai as kitsch, while older people enjoy dancing and singing along to familiar songs, often in Hokkien. Traditional singers such as Liu Lingling tend to dress conservatively, while young performers drawn to getai may choose more revealing outfits.Getai: Sexy, not sleazy, The New Paper, July 7, 2009. Getai has been increasingly accepted and celebrated by the mainstream media. Royston Tan's 2007 movie 881 is based on a pair of getai singers.

History Getai in 2006 Introduction of LED Panels let the audience know who is this singer is Getais are popular among residents in Singapore, as they are held only occasionally. Getai emerged in Singapore in the years of Japanese occupation in the 1940s. An early getai was built in Weiyang Gong in the New World Amusement Park, however it was bombed by the Japanese and a new stage Gongkai Tai was built. The early getai performed mostly songs. Later dancing, drama and acrobatics were also added by performers from gewutuan (歌舞团 or song-and-dance troupes), another kind of entertainment show that had begun to decline in popularity by that time. Getai became increasing popular, and by the 1950s, there were 4 getai stages in the New World, and many other getai were also set up in other amusement parks. Getai in amusement parks declined in popularity in the late 1950s and began to be closed in the 1960s. It had however become established by the 1970s as popular entertainment on makeshift stages set-up along streets and in other public spaces during Ghost Festival. In more recent years, getai has also been organized for other Chinese festivals, such as the Mid-Autumn Festival. Resorts World Sentosa's casino included getai in its 2010 Chinese New Year celebrations. Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple arranged getai for the 2010 Mid- Autumn celebrations. A groundbreaking getai was held in 2006. This was a twelve-hour marathon getai that saw many famous performers gracing the stage and bringing the crowd to their feet. The organiser was Peter Loh, a veteran in the getai scene. The marathon was a one-of-a-kind and it really awed the whole of Singapore. 2011 was another milestone when getai performances were held at Orchard Road Ngee Ann City Civic Plaza for the first time, and the stage design and sound system have major changes throughout the years with including LED Panels. In 2015 & 2018, Singapore Mediacorp Channel 8 held a competition for getai singers called GeTai Challenge (歌台星力量). The show run for two seasons with the most recent season premiered on April 20, 2018 and ended on August 10, 2018. In a more recent attempt, in 2020, Getai performances were now held digitally via various streaming platform websites such as YouTube and its government website gov.sg, in an effort to promote social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore.《e-Getai 歌台直播秀》-YouTube Regulation A Copyright Permit (for Ad-Hoc Events) is needed for public performances, like getai.

It is situated six miles from Newark-on-Trent and thirteen miles from Mansfield. It is the seat of the Bishop of Southwell and Nottingham and the Diocese of Southwell and Nottingham. History =Middle Ages= The earliest church on the site is believed to have been founded in 627 by Paulinus, the first Archbishop of York, when he visited the area while baptising believers in the River Trent. The legend is commemorated in the Minster's baptistry window.As mentioned by Daniel Defoe, (who visited in 1725) in his journal A tour thro' the Whole Island of Great Britain In 956 King Eadwig gave land in Southwell to Oskytel, Archbishop of York, on which a minster church was established. The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded the Southwell manor in great detail. The Norman reconstruction of the church began in 1108, probably as a rebuilding of the Anglo-Saxon church, starting at the east end so that the high altar could be used as soon as possible and the Saxon building was dismantled as work progressed. Many stones from this earlier Anglo-Saxon church were reused in the construction. The tessellated floor and late 11th century tympanum in the north transept are the only parts of the Anglo-Saxon building remaining intact. Work on the nave began after 1120 and the church was completed by c.1150. The church was originally attached to the Archbishop of York's Palace which stood next door and is now ruined. It served the archbishop as a place of worship and was a collegiate body of theological learning, hence its designation as a minster. The minster draws its choir from the nearby school with which it is associated. The Norman chancel was square-ended. For a plan of the original church see Clapham (1936). Figure 45. The chancel was replaced with another in the Early English style in 1234–51 because it was too small. The octagonal chapter house, built starting in 1288 with a vault in the Decorated Gothic style has naturalistic carvings of foliage (the 13th-century stonecarving includes several Green Men). The elaborately carved \\"pulpitum\\" or choir screen was built in 1320–40. =Reformation and civil war= The church suffered less than many others in the English Reformation as it was refounded in 1543 by Act of Parliament. Southwell is where Charles I was captured during the English Civil War, in 1646. The fighting saw the church seriously damaged and the nave is said to have been used as stabling. The adjoining palace was almost completely destroyed, first by Scottish troops and then by the local people, with only the Hall of the Archbishop remaining as a ruined shell. The Minster's financial accounts show that extensive repairs were necessary after this period. =18th century= On 5 November 1711 the southwest spire was struck by lightning, and the resulting fire spread to the nave, crossing and tower destroying roofs, bells, clock and organ. By 1720 repairs had been completed, now giving a flat panelled ceiling to the nave and transepts. =Victorian= In 1805 Archdeacon Kaye gave the Minster the Newstead lectern; once owned by Newstead Abbey, it had been thrown into the Abbey fishpond by the monks to save it during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, then later discovered when the lake was dredged. Henry Gally Knight in 1818 gave the Minster four panels of 16th century Flemish glass (which now fill the bottom part of the East window) which he had acquired from a Parisian pawnshop. In danger of collapse, the spires were removed in 1805 and re-erected in 1879–81 when the minster was extensively restored by Ewan Christian, an architect specialising in churches. The nave roof was replaced with a pitched roofTransactions of the Thoroton Society of Nottinghamshire: Volumes 76–77, 1973 and the choir was redesigned and refitted. Ecclesiastical history =Collegiate church= Southwell Minster was served by prebendaries from the early days of its foundation. By 1291 there were 16 Prebends of Southwell mentioned in the Taxation Roll. In August 1540, as the dissolution of the monasteries was coming to an end, and despite its collegiate rather than monastic status, Southwell Minster was suppressed specifically in order that it could be included in the plans initiated by King Henry VIII to create several new cathedrals. It appears to have been proposed as the see for a new diocese comprising Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, as a replacement for Welbeck Abbey which had been dissolved in 1538 and which by 1540 was no longer owned by the Crown.Jeffery, Paul (2004). The Collegiate Churches of England and Wales. London: Robert Hale pp.37, 263–267Jeffery, Paul (2012). England's Other Cathedrals. Port Stroud: The History Press pp.71–72, 74–75 The plan for the minster's elevation did not proceed, so in 1543 Parliament reconstituted its collegiate status as before. In 1548 it again lost its collegiate status under the 1547 Act of King Edward VI which suppressed (among others) almost all collegiate churches: at Southwell the prebendaries were given pensions and the estates sold, while the church continued as the parish church on the petitions of the parishioners. By an Act of Philip and Mary in 1557, the minster and its prebends were restored. In 1579 a set of statutes was promulgated by Queen Elizabeth I and the chapter operated under this constitution until it was dissolved in 1841. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners made provision for the abolition of the chapter as a whole; the death of each canon after this time resulted in the extinction of his prebend. The chapter came to its appointed end on 12 February 1873 with the death of Thomas Henry Shepherd, rector of Clayworth and prebendary of Beckingham. =Cathedral= In 1884 Southwell Minster became a cathedral proper for Nottinghamshire and a part of Derbyshire including the city of Derby. The diocese was divided in 1927 and the Diocese of Derby was formed. The diocese's centenary was commemorated by a royal visit to distribute Maundy money. George Ridding, the first Bishop of Southwell, designed and paid for the grant of Arms now used as the diocesan coat of arms. Architecture Compartments of the nave, interior and exterior The nave, transepts, central tower and two western towers of the Norman church which replaced the Saxon minster remain as an outstanding achievement of severe Romanesque design. With the exception of fragments mentioned above, they are the oldest part of the existing church. The Nave is of seven bays, plus a separated western bay. The columns of the arcade are short and circular, with small scalloped capitals. The triforium has a single large arch in each bay. The clerestory has small round-headed windows. The external window openings are circular. There is a tunnel-vaulted passage between the inside and outside window openings of the clerestory. The nave aisles are vaulted, the main roof of the nave is a trussed rafter roof, with tie-beams between each bay – a late C19 replacement. By contrast with the nave arcade, the arches of the crossing are tall, rising to nearly the full height of the nave walls. The capitals of the east crossing piers depict scenes from the life of Jesus. Two stages of the inside of the central tower can be seen at the crossing, with cable and wave decoration on the lower order and zigzag on the upper. The transepts have three stories with semi-circular arches, like the nave, but without aisles. Rib vault of Southwell Minster choirThe western facade has pyramidal spires on its towers – a unique feature today, though common in the C12. The existing spires date only from 1880, but they replace those destroyed by fire in 1711, which are documented in old illustrations. The large west window dates from the C15. The central tower's two ornamental stages place it high among England's surviving Norman towers. The lower order has intersecting arches, the upper order plain arches. The north porch has a tunnel vault, and is decorated with intersecting arches. The choir is Early English in style, and was completed in 1241. It has transepts, thus separating the choir into a western and eastern arm. The choir is of two stories, with no gallery or triforium. The lower storey has clustered columns with multiform pointed arches, the upper storey has twin lancet arches in each bay. The rib vault of the choir springs from clustered shafts which rest on corbels. The vault has ridge ribs. The square east end of the choir has two stories each of four lancet windows. Entrance portal of the Chapter House with the famous carved foliage Chapter house capital with carving of hops Southwell rood screen (pulpitum) from the choir In the 14th century the chapter house and the choir screen were added. The chapter house, started in 1288, is in an early decorated style, octagonal, with no central pier. It is reached from the choir by a passage and vestibule, through an entrance portal. This portal has five orders, and is divided by a central shaft into two subsidiary arches with a circle with quatrefoil above. Inside the chapter house, the stalls fill the octagonal wall sections, each separated by a single shaft with a triangular canopy above. The windows are of three lights, above them two circles with trefoils and above that a single circle with quatrefoil. This straightforward description gives no indication of the glorious impression, noted by so many writers, of the elegant proportions of the space, and of the profusion (in vestibule and passage, not just in the chapter house) of exquisitely carved capitals and tympana, mostly representing leaves in a highly naturalistic and detailed representation. The capitals in particular are deeply undercut, adding to the feeling of realism. Individual plant species such as ivy, maple, oak, hop, hawthorn can often be identified. The botanist Albert Seward published a detailed description of the carvings and their identification in 1935 and Nikolaus Pevsner wrote the classic description entitled The Leaves of Southwell, with photographs by Frederick Attenborough, in 1945. The rood screen dates from 1320–1340, and is an outstanding example of the Decorated style. It has an east and west facade, separated by a vaulted space with flying ribs. The east facade, of two stories, is particularly richly decorated, with niches on the lower story with ogee arches, and openwork gables on the upper storey. The central archway rises higher than the lower storey, with an ogee arch surmounted by a cusped gable. The finest memorial in the minster is the alabaster tomb of Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York (died 1588).

Choristers are educated at the Minster School, which is unusual among choir schools as it is in the state sector. The choir has attracted international attention when previous head chorister Ben Inman, formed the Choirboys, a \\"boy band\\" comprising three cathedral choristers. There is a girls' choir and the adult Minster Chorale. The minster follows the rites of the Church of England and uses the 1662 Book of Common Prayer for Choral Eucharist on Sunday. The Friends of Cathedral Music was founded in 1956 by Ronald Sibthorpe prompted by a decision of the provost to abolish Saturday choral evensong so that lay clerks could watch football at Newark-on-Trent. =Choirs= In recent years, the choir has broadcast on BBC Radio 3, recorded CDs, toured in Europe, filmed Christmas programmes and given world premières of specially commissioned works such as Paul Patterson's Southwell Millennium Mass. The choir has appeared before the Queen, sung with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, the Orchestra of St John's, Smith Square and the London Festival Orchestra. In 2003 the Minster Choir joined the choirs of Westminster Cathedral and St Albans Cathedral for a concert in the St Albans International Organ Festival. Ted Heath, former Prime Minister, wrote \\"I cannot recall a more impressive programme of church music in many recent years. My deepest congratulations for an evening the richness of which will last for ever\\". There are usually 16 choristers in the Cathedral Choir. As with most choirs there is a hierarchical ranking system, in this case of Head Chorister; Deputy Head Chorister; Corner Boys; Senior Singing Boys; Junior Singing Boys and Probationers. The ranks of corner boy upwards are entitled to wear a 'tippet', a very short red cloak which is worn over the surplice. There are also Juniors who do not sing with the full choir, but are training to become full choristers. There are six full-time professional lay clerks in the choir supplemented by six men on alternate Sunday evenings and on special occasions, expanding the repertoire and force of the choir. The lay clerks often perform in their own right in services. The Minster Girls' Choir was formed in February 2005 by the Assistant Organist Simon Bell. It is made up of 18 choristers, under the direction of Simon Hogan. The girls are drawn from the Minster School. They sing at the 9.30am Family Eucharist on Sundays once per month and at Evensong every Monday at 5.45pm. The choir's repertoire consists of music written for upper voices and includes music by composers such as Jean Langlais, Charles Wood and George Dyson. In September 2007, the choir sang a commissioned anthem by Andrew Parnell, a former chorister at Southwell, as part of the service of installation of the Dean. The choir's first tour was to Stavanger in Norway in October 2009, followed by another in 2013 to Amsterdam. In 2011 it released a CD, Christus Rex – a selection of music from Lent to Ascension, including Leighton's Easter Sequence, directed by Philip White-Jones and accompanied by Jonathan Turner with Richard Pratt, trumpet. The Minster Chorale is an adult choir that sings at services throughout the year. It consists of up to thirty members who rehearse on Friday evenings. Currently directed by the Assistant Director of Music, the chorale was founded in 1994 by Philip Rushforth and Paul Hale. The choir sings a cross-section of the whole repertoire of traditional cathedral music, including works by Palestrina, Byrd, Mozart, Stanford and Howells. It deputises for the Minster Choir at half-term, and sings at many evening Eucharist services on high feast days, such as Ash Wednesday, Maundy Thursday and Ascension Day. The Chorale takes its share of Christmas duties, singing at Midnight Mass. The chorale is invited to perform occasional concerts and services away from the minster. It has sung in Rievaulx Abbey, St Mary's Collegiate Church in Warwick and Uppingham Parish Church. In July 2005, the chorale sang a services at Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin. In summer 2011, it joined with the Voluntary Choir of Rochester Cathedral to celebrate the music of Rochester composers such as Robert Ashfield, Barry Ferguson and Percy Whitlock. =List of Rectores Chori= * Lawrence Pepys 1499 * George Vincent 1519 * George Thetford 1568 * John Mudd 1582 * Thomas Foster 1584 * William Colbecke 1586 * John Beeston 1594 * Edward Manestie 1596 * Francis Dogson 1622 * John Hutchinson 1628 * Edward Chappell 1661 * George Chappell 1690 * William Popeley 1699 * William Lee 1718–1754 * Samuel Wise 1754–1755 * Edmund Ayrton 1755–1764 * Thomas Spofforth 1764–1818 * Edward Heathcote 1818–1835 * Frederick Gunton 1835–1841 * Chappell Batchelor 1841–1857 * Herbert Stephen Irons 1857–1872 * Cedric Bucknall 1872–1876 * William Weaver Ringrose 1876–1879 * W Arthur Marriott 1879–1888 * Robert William Liddle 1888–1918 * Harry William Tupper 1918–1929 * George Thomas Francis 1929–1946 * Robert James Ashfield 1946–1956 * David James Lumsden 1956–1959 * Kenneth Bernard Beard 1959–1989 * Paul Robert Hale 1989–2016 * Paul Provost Apr 2017– To see the list of organists, assistant directors of music and organ scholars, see the list of musicians at English cathedrals. = Southwell Music Festival = The Minster is also home to the annual Southwell Music Festival, held in late August.

In London while still a young man, he inspired The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor in 1884, but seemed to have little to do with the day-to-day running of the organisation, or indeed its actual teachings (Chanel et al., Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor). There is some dispute over whether Théon taught Blavatsky at some stage; the Mother in The Agenda says he did, Chanel et al. considers this unlikely, while K. Paul Johnson speculates in The Masters Revealed that the Theosophical adept Tuitit Bey might be based on Théon. The Hermetic Brotherhood of Luxor claimed to have originated in Egypt in 1870 and been brought to England by Théon in 1884. In 1885 Théon married Mary Chrystine Woodroffe Ware (Madame Alma Théon), and the following year the couple moved to Paris. In December 1887, the Théons left France for Algiers, where they were later joined by Alma Théon's friend Augusta Roife (Miss Teresa), and acquired a large estate in Zarif, a suburb of Tlemcen, Algeria. However Théon would still go on frequent visits to Paris. Théon gathered a number of students, including Louis Themanlys and Charles Barlet, and they established the \\"Cosmic Movement\\". This was based on material, called the Cosmic Tradition, received or perhaps channelled by T Théon's wife. They established the journal Cosmic Review, for the \\"study and re-establishment of the original Tradition\\". Théon stated that his wife Alma was the moving spirit behind this idea, and without her the Tradition and the cosmic philosophy would never have come about. Louis was a friend of Matteo Alfassa, the brother of Mirra Alfassa (who would later associate with Sri Aurobindo and become The Mother), and in 1905 or 1906 Mirra travelled to Tlemcen to study occultism under Théon (Sujata Nahar, Mirra the Occultist). The Mother mentions that Sri Aurobindo and Théon had independently and at the same time arrived at some similar conclusions about evolution of human consciousness without having met each other. The Mother's design of Sri Aurobindo's symbol is very similar to that of Théon's, with only small changes in the proportions of the central square (Mother's Agenda, vol 3, p. 454, dated December 15, 1962). The death of his wife in 1908 was a huge blow to Théon, from which he never really recovered. He fell into a deep depression, and cancelled the Cosmic Movement. During this time he was cared for by his followers. He recovered somewhat but never retained his former status. Théon died at Tlemcen on 4 March 1927.

First described in 1979, the acronym \\"CHARGE\\" came into use for newborn children with the congenital features of coloboma of the eye, heart defects, atresia of the nasal choanae, retardation of growth and/or development, genital and/or urinary abnormalities, and ear abnormalities and deafness. These features are no longer used in making a diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome, but the name remains. About two thirds of cases are due to a CHD7 mutation. CHARGE syndrome occurs only in 0.1–1.2 per 10,000 live births; as of 2009 it was the leading cause of congenital deafblindness in the US. The 2008 National Child Count of Children and Youth who are Deaf- Blind , The National Consortium on Deaf-Blindness, 2009pages=30page= Genetics CHARGE syndrome was formerly referred to as CHARGE association, which indicates a non-random pattern of congenital anomalies that occurs together more frequently than one would expect on the basis of chance. Very few people with CHARGE will have 100% of its known features. In 2004, mutations on the CHD7 gene (located on Chromosome 8) were found in 10 of 17 patients in the Netherlands, making CHARGE an official syndrome. A 2006 US study of 110 individuals with CHARGE syndrome showed that 60% of those tested had a mutation of the CHD7 gene. In 2010, a review of 379 clinically diagnosed cases of CHARGE syndrome, in which CHD7 mutation testing was undertaken found that 67% of cases were due to a CHD7 mutation. CHD7 is a member of the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding (CHD) protein family that plays a role in transcription regulation by chromatin remodeling. Diagnosis The diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome is often difficult, because it is rare. The syndrome spans many disciplines, and as such, can be diagnosed by a pediatrician, family medicine physician, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, ENT specialist, ophthalmologist, endocrinologist, cardiologist, urologist, developmental specialist, radiologist, geneticist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, or orthopedic specialist. =Signs= Although genetic testing positively identifies nearly two thirds of children with CHARGE syndrome, diagnosis is still largely clinical. The following signs were originally identified in children with this syndrome, but are no longer used in to make the diagnosis alone. * C – Coloboma of the eye, central nervous system anomalies * H – Heart defects * A – Atresia of the choanae * R – Retardation of growth and/or development * G – Genital and/or urinary defects (hypogonadism, undescended testicles, besides hypospadias) * E – Ear anomalies and/or deafness and abnormally bowl-shaped and concave ears, known as \\"lop ears\\". =Genetic testing= Genetic testing for CHARGE syndrome involves specific genetic testing for the CHD7 gene. The test is available at most major genetic testing laboratories. Insurance companies sometimes do not pay for such genetic tests, though this is changing rapidly as genetic testing is becoming standard across all aspects of medicine. CHARGE syndrome is a clinical diagnosis, which means genetic testing is not required in order to make the diagnosis. Rather, the diagnosis can be made based on clinical features alone. =Screening other organ systems= Once the diagnosis is made based on clinical signs, it is important to investigate other body systems that may be involved. For example, if the diagnosis is made based on the abnormal appearance of the ears and developmental delay, it is important to check the child's hearing, vision, heart, nose, and urogenital system. Ideally, every child newly diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome should have a complete evaluation by an ENT specialist, audiologist, ophthalmologist, pediatric cardiologist, developmental therapist, and pediatric urologist. Therapy Children with CHARGE syndrome may have a number of life- threatening medical conditions; with advances in medical care, these children can survive and can thrive with the support of a multidisciplinary team of medical professionals. Therapies and education must take into consideration hearing impairment, vision problems, and any others. Early intervention, such as occupational, speech-language, and physical therapy, to improve static posture, ambulation, and self-care skills is important. The intelligence of children with multiple health impairments, such as combined deafblindness, can be underestimated in the absence of early intervention. =Education= Children with CHARGE syndrome will vary greatly in their abilities in the classroom: some may need little support, while some may require full-time support and individualized programs. Taking each of the various affected body systems into account is vital to the success of the child in the educational setting. An important step in dealing with abnormal behavior is understanding why it is occurring and helping the child learn more appropriate methods of communicating. Epidemiology The incidence is estimated to range from 0.1–1.2 per 10,000 live births, though the true incidence is unknown. As of 2005, the highest prevalence was found in Canada and estimated at 1 in 8,500 live births. History  B.D. Hall first described the CHARGE association in a 1979 journal paper of about 17 children who had been born with choanal atresia. During the same year, H.M. Hittner described 10 children who had choanal atresia as well as coloboma, congenital heart defect, and hearing loss. Using both coloboma or choanal atresia and some of the other related characteristic malformations, R. A. Pagon first coined the acronym CHARGE in 1981 to emphasize that this cluster of associated malformations occurred together. It came to be recognised as a syndrome within the umbrella of the CHARGE association, a set of apparently random signs occurring together. Since the signs seen in CHARGE are caused by a genetic anomaly, its name was eventually changed to 'CHARGE syndrome'.

Biography Primrose's father was a power station engineer, so his family moved wherever the job took him. A posting to Middlesbrough was followed by a series of moves across the northeast of England that spanned the first ten years of Primrose's life. At age 15 in high school in Glasgow he was playing drums with friends in local bands. From the age of 17, the next step was going for as many auditions as possible and looking for like-minded players to form a group. This led to his joining the band Glass Onion with Andy Dunlop along with brothers Chris and Geoff Martyn in the early 1990s. After years of touring and looking for success, the line- up changed with Fran Healy eventually joining the line-up and the group then splitting with the Martyn brothers and bringing Dougie Payne in for bass guitar. Eventually, the name for the band was changed to Travis. Unlike the other three members of the band, Primrose was not a student at the Glasgow School of Art instead working various jobs and studying Computer Science for a pre-degree course. Initially, Travis rehearsed in The Horse Shoe Bar where Primrose and Healy had met for the first time. The material for their first two albums was, in part, written and refined here. Travis moved to London in late spring 1996 and lived, rehearsed and toured from their North London base for many years. Travis' début album Good Feeling was released in 1997 with positive review, but lukewarm performance in the charts. Their 1999 follow-up, The Man Who, proved to be far more successful, selling millions of copies worldwide, shortly followed by The Invisible Band in 2001. During this period, Travis had several UK hit singles, including Sing and Why Does It Always Rain On Me?. Before the recording of Travis' fourth album, 12 Memories, Primrose suffered a life-threatening spine injury while he was swimming on holiday in France. This led to the cancellation of several subsequent tour dates – most significantly a headline slot at V Festival. Primrose made a full recovery and was back on stage and recording with the band within months – including Isle of Wight Festival and Live 8 in 2005. As of 2016, Travis have released four more albums and continue to tour worldwide. Primrose has played drums on the Canadian musician Ron Sexsmith's seventh album Retriever and other individual album tracks, along with albums by Jamie Scott, Yusaf Islam, Magne F and Cyril Paulus. In Scotland, Primrose plays with the MOVE Project along with various artists on the Wild Biscuit label. Personal life Primrose is married to Esther, and has two daughters. He supports Rangers. In 2007, Primrose gained his first racing licence and has since driven in many racing events including the Classic Le Mans series and the SPA 25Hr FunCup.

It was derived from the A15 Crusader tank and was superseded by the A27 Cromwell tank.  Development  =Early Development= Development of the Cavalier initially started as development of the Cromwell tank. In mid-1940, the British were considering which tank should follow on from the new cruiser tanks then being developed. A specification was drawn up by the Directorate of Tanks and Transport which included the QF 6 pounder gun. This led to General Staff specification A23 for a cruiser version of the A22 Churchill tank from Vauxhall, and A24 from Nuffield Mechanization & Aero Limited based upon their Crusader tank design. Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company (BRC&W;) also submitted a design based on the Crusader. The Nuffield design used an uprated (410 hp) Liberty engine which was expected to give a top speed of . Armour would be from 63 to 70 mm at the front, and the 6 pounder gun would be in a turret on a 60-inch turret ring. The Tank Board meeting in January 1941 decided that as the tank needed to be in production by early 1942 it should be based upon an existing design to avoid the need for prototypes. Six tanks of the A24 Nuffield design were ordered that month, and the tank was named Cromwell. =Separation from Cromwell= Rolls-Royce's design team, working with Leyland's engineers, produced the Meteor engine. This gave a higher output than the Liberty for a similar size. Initially intended to be fitted to the A24, the new engine was not acceptable to Nuffield. Working with Rolls Royce and Leyland, BRC&W; were able to produce a prototype of their version of the Cromwell design using the Meteor. This spawned a new specification for Cromwell, A27, using a new Leyland transmission. Leyland later had doubts about the Meteor and wanted to manufacture the Liberty instead, splitting the Cromwell programme further into A24, A27L, and A27M. The General staff specifications now covered three tanks: A24 \\"Cromwell I\\" from Nuffield, A27L (Liberty engine) \\"Cromwell II\\" from Leyland and A27M (Meteor engine) \\"Cromwell III\\". To avoid confusion Cromwell I was renamed \\"Cavalier\\". The Cromwell II become \\"Centaur\\" and the Cromwell III remained as the \\"Cromwell\\". Production and design efforts separated from A27, and Cavalier became a separate tank. Production At the end of 1941, it was decided production of the Nuffield design would be by Nuffield and Ruston and Hornsby. The schedule had already slipped due to work on other projects and work to fit the 6-pounder to the Crusader tank. The first tank began trials in March 1942. Production versions of the Cromwell delivered first, and provided greater performance than the Cavalier. Cavalier was judged unsatisfactory and the Nuffield order was reduced to 500 tanks. It never entered front-line service. Design Internally, the Cavalier was subdivided by bulkheads, which also functioned as structural members. The driver and hull gunner were in the front compartment, the fighting compartment was in the centre. The bulkhead behind the fighting compartment was the firewall from the engine, a Liberty Mark IV, and the final bulkhead separated the engine from the transmission. Mechanically, the Cavalier was similar to the preceding Crusader tank, using Wilson steering and the Liberty engine. The newer Liberty Mark IV gave more power than the one in the Crusader. The operation of the steering brakes and gear changing remained pneumatic. Outwardly, the design of Cavalier is very similar to the related Cromwell and Centaur. Cavaliers do not have the upper air intake of Cromwell, which is optional on the Centaur. Cavalier has shorter suspension arms. Cavaliers were built with hull types A and B. Exhaust exits through the hull rear plate using Crusader style angled louvres,Illustrated Parts List Cavalier 1; Chilwell Ct. No. 62/346 where Cromwell and Centaur both exhaust to the vehicle top. The Cavalier turret was a six sided boxy structure. The mantlet was internal with a large opening in the front of the turret for the gun barrel, the coaxial Besa machine gun and the aperture of the No. 39 telescopic sight. The gun was of the \\"free elevation\\" type; the gun was balanced such that it could be readily moved by the gunner. This fitted with British practice of firing on the move. Service history Those that were built were used in training or auxiliary armoured vehicle roles. At least 12 Cavaliers were provided to France in 1945, and were operated by the 12th Dragoon Regiment of the French 14th Infantry Division.  Variants  ;Cavalier OP :Produced in 1943. The gun was replaced with a dummy barrel freeing up room in the turret and hull for extra radios. It was then used as an artillery observation post. ;Cavalier ARV :The turret was removed and an A-frame jib and associated equipment added for use as an armoured recovery vehicle.

Hence, \\\\phi is an extension of the continuous functional \\\\lim x:c\\\\mapsto \\\\mathbb C where c \\\\subset\\\\ell^\\\\infty is the complex vector space of all sequences which converge to a (usual) limit in \\\\mathbb C. In other words, a Banach limit extends the usual limits, is linear, shift-invariant and positive. However, there exist sequences for which the values of two Banach limits do not agree. We say that the Banach limit is not uniquely determined in this case. As a consequence of the above properties, a real-valued Banach limit also satisfies: : \\\\liminf_ {n\\\\to\\\\infty} x_n\\\\le\\\\phi(x) \\\\le \\\\limsup_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}x_n The existence of Banach limits is usually proved using the Hahn–Banach theorem (analyst's approach),Conway, Theorem III.7.1 or using ultrafilters (this approach is more frequent in set-theoretical expositions).Balcar-Štěpánek, 8.34 These proofs necessarily use the Axiom of choice (so called non-effective proof). Almost convergence There are non- convergent sequences which have a uniquely determined Banach limit. For example, if x=(1,0,1,0,\\\\ldots), then x+S(x)=(1,1,1,\\\\ldots) is a constant sequence, and :2\\\\phi(x)=\\\\phi(x)+\\\\phi(Sx)=\\\\phi(x+Sx)=\\\\phi((1,1,1,\\\\ldots))=\\\\lim((1,1,1,\\\\ldots))=1 holds. Thus, for any Banach limit, this sequence has limit 1/2. A bounded sequence x with the property, that for every Banach limit \\\\phi the value \\\\phi(x) is the same, is called almost convergent. Banach spaces Given a convergent sequence x=(x_n) in c \\\\subset\\\\ell^\\\\infty, the ordinary limit of x does not arise from an element of \\\\ell^1, if the duality \\\\langle\\\\ell^1,\\\\ell^\\\\infty\\\\rangle is considered. The latter means \\\\ell^\\\\infty is the continuous dual space (dual Banach space) of \\\\ell^1, and consequently, \\\\ell^1 induces continuous linear functionals on \\\\ell^\\\\infty, but not all. Any Banach limit on \\\\ell^\\\\infty is an example of an element of the dual Banach space of \\\\ell^\\\\infty which is not in \\\\ell^1. The dual of \\\\ell^\\\\infty is known as the ba space, and consists of all (signed) finitely additive measures on the sigma-algebra of all subsets of the natural numbers, or equivalently, all (signed) Borel measures on the Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers.

A writer, director, and actress in films from mid 1906 to 1920, she wrote screenplays for 42 films. She performed in 87 films and is credited as the director of The Grandmother (1909). Biography Born as Genevieve Gauntier Liggett in Kansas City, Missouri, to James Wesley and Ada J. Gauntier Liggett, she was the middle child of three children. Her older brother was Richard Green Liggett (1880–1941) and her sister was Marguerite Gauntier Liggett (1891–1973), who married Swedish billionaire Axel Wenner- Gren. Gauntier attended the Kansas City School of Oratory while in Kansas City. In 1904, she began her stage career. Gauntier made her way to New York City where she began her career in live theater using the stage name \\"Gene Gauntier,\\" and first appeared in films between acting jobs with stock company tours. She remembered in her 1928 autobiography Blazing the Trail: > “My funds were running low, and in a vague way I thought of the new opening > for actors – moving pictures, but, like the rest of the legitimate > profession, I looked on them with contempt and felt sure that my prestige > would be lowered if I worked in them.\\" In June 1906, Gauntier was literally thrown into her first screen assignment when she was hired for a daredevil stunt, being filmed as a damsel thrown into a river for Biograph's The Paymaster. It was a one-reeler, where she first met her long-time friend Sidney Olcott and Frank Marion. Gauntier then returned to stage acting as the lead female role in George Ade's The County Chairman at Kansas City's Grand Opera House. =The Kalem Company= In 1907, Gauntier became more involved in the fledgling silent film industry, working for Kalem Studios. She became Kalem's star actress, dubbed by the studio as the \\"Kalem Girl,\\" and also became their most productive screenwriter in collaboration with director Sidney Olcott on numerous film projects. In 1924, after her departure from the film industry, Gauntier reminisced about her time at Kalem as an intensely fruitful period of creative freedom, when her authorial control and influence extended well beyond acting: :In addition to playing the principal parts, I also wrote, with the exception of a bare half-dozen, every one of the five hundred or so pictures in which I appeared. I picked locations, supervised sets, passed on tests, co-directed with Sidney Olcott, cut and edited and wrote captions (when in the United States), got up a large part of the advertising matter, and, with it all, averaged a reel a week. It was work in those days—but creative work, blazing the trail. We were always discovering new possibilities and each little success or surprise fed our enthusiasm. Mr. Olcott and I had no one over us. I scarcely ever submitted a scenario and never while abroad. The Kalem never knew what our picture was to be until they saw the first run in the projection room. We would have risked our lives (and did many times) out of sheer love for, and loyalty to the Kalem. For four years the same friends were together and we were known as the O'Kalems, and later, during the oriental tour, as the El Kalems. Gauntier's astonishing range of creative decision-making at Kalem reflects the \\"creative chaos in the early years [of the industry that] favored women’s relatively full participation while a new order in the industry mandated against it.\\" By 1912, Gauntier had become disillusioned with the new conditions at Kalem, and left to start her own company, Gene Gauntier Feature Players. Gene Gauntier and Jack Clarke filming on location in Ireland in 1912's \\"You Remember Ellen\\" =Writing and copyright= Tom Sawyer was the first of over three hundred screenplays Gene Gauntier either wrote and produced or sold. In 1907, she wrote the script for The Days of '61, the first film ever made about the American Civil War. That same year she wrote the screenplay and acted in the first Ben Hur film. The film was adapted in two days: > \\"I was not familiar with Ben Hur and the mere reading of the book would take > two days. But this time my self-confidence [in writing] was unlimited and I > promised. What is more by dint of working nearly two nights I turned in the > script on schedule...and we turned out the greatest spectacle and money- > maker up to that time.\\" At the time, there was no copyright law to protect authors, and she wrote in her autobiography about how the film industry infringed upon everything. As a result of the production of Ben Hur, Harper and Brothers and the author's estate (General Lew Wallace) brought suit against the Kalem Company, the Motion Picture Patents Company, and Gauntier for copyright infringement. The suit, which eventually settled the question of American copyright law for all time, took years to make its way through the court system but the United States Supreme Court finally ruled in favor of Harpers and Wallace, and against the film company. Most notably, Gauntier wrote and acted in 1912's From the Manger to the Cross; a film that Turner Classic Movies considers the most important silent film to deal with the life of Jesus Christ, and which has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry. =Independent company = In December 1912, Gene Gauntier left the Kalem Company and started the independent Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company, along with her long time collaborator Sidney Olcott and her actor husband Jack Clark. She was among a number of women silent film stars to start their own independent companies during this period. Others included Florence Lawrence with the Victor Company, Helen Holmes with the Signal Film Company, Flora Finch with the Flora Finch Company (1916-1917) and Film Frolic Picture Corporation (1920), and Marion Leonard with the Gem Motion Picture Company. In early 1914, Sidney Olcott resigned as producer at Gauntier's company to start his own Sid Olcott International Features. The cause of his falling out with Gauntier remains unclear. The Gene Gauntier Feature Players Company continued until 1915. Notable works include, The Civil War-era (1912), A Daughter of the Confederacy (1913) (adapted from Wallace Reid's stage play), Mystery of Pine Camp (1913), When Men Hate (1913), For Ireland's Sake (1914), A Daughter of Old Ireland (1914), and The Eye of the Government (1914). Gauntier wrote and starred in many of the films her company produced, while Olcott is credited as the main director during this time. Gaunter Feature Players became competitors of Kalem and eventually faded into oblivion once Gauntier signed on with Universal Pictures and moved to Hollywood. =Exit from the film industry= In 1920 at age thirty-five, and after writing forty-two screenplays and performing in eighty-seven films, Gauntier walked away from the business. In a 1924 interview with Photoplay, Gauntier explained her reasons for leaving: \\"I was worn out and had lost enthusiasm, without which we cannot, of course, progress. My work in pictures had been too difficult, my strength was sapped and it had become drudgery, especially the new way in which they were produced [...] After being mastered of all I surveyed, I could not work under the new conditions. Domestic tragedy was the finishing touch and I was glad to get out while I could still retain some pleasant memories of the good old days.\\" =Personal life and later years= In 1912, Gene Gauntier married actor Jack J. Clark. They were divorced in 1918. She had a brother, Richard Gauntier Liggett and a sister, Marguerite Gauntier Liggett. Marguerite married wealthy Swedish industrialist Axel Wenner-Gren in 1909.The tomb of Gene Gauntier at Häringe Slot, Sweden Gauntier had sailed to Europe frequently where her sister Marguerite was an opera singer who had trained and worked in Germany, and found herself stranded there when World War I broke out. After leaving filmmaking, she worked as the film and drama critic for the Kansas City Post in 1919, before returning to live in Europe where she remained for a number of years while writing her autobiography, Blazing the Trail. The work was serialized in 1928–29 in the American magazine, Woman's Home Companion, and the manuscript is on display in the Film Library of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Gauntier also penned two novels, Cabbages and Harlequins in 1929 and Sporting Lady in 1933. Gene Gauntier died in 1966 in Cuernavaca, Mexico, aged 81. She is buried in Sweden at Häringe Slott close to Marguerite, her sister and Axel Wenner-Gren, her brother-in-Law. In 1914, June 11 was declared as \\"Gauntier Day\\" at the International Exposition of Motion Pictures.

Many (perhaps most) clinical mentions of left shift refer to the white blood cell lineage, particularly neutrophil-precursor band cells, thus signifying bandemia. Less commonly, left shift may also refer to a similar phenomenon in the red blood cell lineage in severe anemia, when increased reticulocytes and immature erythrocyte-precursor cells appear in the peripheral circulation. Definition The standard definition of a left shift is an absolute band form count greater than 7700/microL. There are competing explanations for the origin of the phrase \\"left shift,\\" including the left-most button arrangement of early cell sorting machineshttp://medicineoutofthebox.com/2010/10/26/the- meaning-of-a-shift-to-the-left/http://www.pathologystudent.com/?p=318 and a 1920s publication by Josef Arneth, containing a graph in which immature neutrophils, with fewer segments, shifted the median left. In the latter view, the name reflects a curve's preponderance shifting to the left on a graph of hematopoietic cellular differentiations. Morphology It is usually noted on microscopic examination of a blood smear. This systemic effect of inflammation is most often seen in the course of an active infection and during other severe illnesses such as hypoxia and shock. Döhle bodies may also be present in the neutrophil's cytoplasm in the setting of sepsis or severe inflammatory responses. Pathogenesis It is believed that cytokines (including IL-1 and TNF) accelerate the release of cells from the postmitotic reserve pool in the bone marrow, leading to an increased number of immature cells.

He was a student of the Střední průmyslová škola železniční (Industrial Highschool of Railways) technical college in Šumperk, specializing in railroads, and was also interested in poetry and humanities. In 1969 he took part in a hunger strike and a commemoration ceremony by students for Jan Palach near the statue of Saint Wenceslas in Prague. On the day of the twenty-first anniversary of the Communist takeover (25 February 1969), he travelled to Prague accompanied by three other students. His intention was to warn the public against the forthcoming political \\"normalization\\" of the country. He had several letters challenging the people to fight against the Warsaw Pact's military occupation of Czechoslovakia. Around 1:30 in the afternoon he walked into the passageway of the building at No. 39 on Wenceslas Square and ignited his chemical-soaked clothes. He was unable to run out of the door, and collapsed and died in the hallway. In a letter he left behind he wrote: The police prohibited his burial in Prague because they feared demonstrations, such as the ones that followed the burial of Jan Palach. He was later buried in his hometown of Vítkov. After the Velvet Revolution, a bronze cross was set into the ground in front of the National Museum in Wenceslas Square to honour both Palach and Zajíc. His death mask by sculptor Olbram Zoubek is situated at his high school (now Vyšší odborná škola a střední průmyslová škola Šumperk).

Gyrodyne's headquarters are located in Saint James, New York, in Eastern Long Island. It was founded in 1946, initially as a helicopter design and manufacturing company. History Gyrodyne Company of America was founded in 1946 by Peter J. Papadakos, using the assets he bought from the bankrupt Bendix Helicopters Company. The company continued Bendix's development of a one-man synchronized co-axial rotor helicopter in Massapequa, New York, before moving to St. James, New York, in 1951. For the next 24 years the company was engaged in the design, testing, development, and production of coaxial helicopters, primarily the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH drone for the U.S. Navy. In 1975, Gyrodyne began converting its helicopter manufacturing facilities into rental space suitable for light industry. Since then the company has concentrated its efforts on the management and development of real estate. On November 2, 2005, Stony Brook University seized 245.5 acres under eminent domain from Gyrodyne, initially paying them $26,315,000 for the property. In 2006, Gyrodyne opened a case for just compensation. Finally, in 2010, the Court of Claims ruled in Gyrodyne's favor when it awarded the company $125,000,000 thereby requiring the state to pay an additional $98,685,000 plus interest of nine percent from the date of taking, to the date of payment. In 2006, Gyrodyne became a publicly traded Real Estate Investment Trust. Around this time, Gyrodyne began focusing on purchasing medical properties. Since then, the company has bought three such facilities: two in New York, and one in Northern Virginia.

In addition, the company has a limited partnership investment in a citrus grove called the Callery-Judge Grove, located in Palm Beach County, Florida. Flowerfield is the location of Gyrodyne's headquarters and is the former site of the helicopter manufacturing facility. It is located in Saint James, New York, 50 miles east of New York City. Flowerfield is a 68-acre property with 127,062 square feet of rentable space zoned primarily for light industry. Initially more than 300 acres, most of the Flowerfield property was taken by Stony Brook University under eminent domain in 2005. In June 2007 the company acquired ten buildings in the Port Jefferson Professional Park in Port Jefferson Station, New York. These buildings are situated on 5.16 acres with 39,329 square feet of rentable space. Cortlandt Medical Center in Cortlandt Manor, New York, was acquired by the company on June 2, 2008. It contains five office buildings which are situated on 5.01 acres with 31,198 rentable square feet. The company also acquired land around this site, including a 16,000 square foot house located on 1.43 acres, and 2,500 rentable square feet on 1.6 acres.

Though by definition also engaged in prostitution, they were distinguished by their skills in the traditional arts, with the highest-ranking having a degree of choice in which customers they took. The term originated in , the red-light district of Edo in the 1750s, and is applied to all ranks of high-level courtesans in historical Japan. Many became celebrities both inside and outside of the pleasure quarters, and would often entertain the upper classes of society, gaining the nickname of (lit., \\"castle-toppler\\") for their perceived reputation of being able to match the wit and steal the hearts of upper-class men. This archetype became commonly-represented in kabuki theatre, both in (\\"contemporary\\" [for the Edo period]) and (\\"period\\") plays. Though regarded as trend-setting, fashionable women at the historic height of their profession, this reputation was later usurped in the late 18th- through 19th-centuries by geisha, who became popular for their freer and more fashionable expressions of contemporary womanhood. The profession continued to decline steadily throughout the 19th century, before prostitution was outlawed in Japan in 1957. Cultural aspects of the performing arts traditions of , which in some cases differed significantly to geisha, continue to this day, preserved by re- enactors who do not engage in prostitution as part of their re-enactment role.

These quarters were often placed some distance from the centre of the attached town or city, and the legal status and location of these districts changed on a number of occasions throughout the following centuries; on occasion, some were closed and their inhabitants either sent to live or work elsewhere, sometimes in another, larger red-light district. The three districts most well-known historically were in Kyoto (which also housed geisha until the 1970s), in Osaka and in Edo (present-day Tokyo). Over time, these districts rapidly grew into large and self-contained neighbourhoods, containing a number of different forms of entertainment outside of prostitution, including performances and festivals. Geisha also occasionally worked within these districts, having been periodically forbidden to work outside of them. =Status, rank and terms= Compared to , whose primary attraction was sexual services, courtesans were first and foremost entertainers.

The word therefore appeared in as a polite term of address for any remaining woman of courtesan rank. =Appearance= The appearance of was markedly set apart from that of both geisha and the average woman; by the height of the profession at the beginning of the Edo period, wore upwards of eight large (hairpins), often made from tortoiseshell, silver, gold and gemstones, worn in a number of elaborate, heavily-waxed hairstyles known as , though a number of different hairstyles - with a number of different names - were worn, all representing different ranks, seasons and occasions. An 's outfit consisted of a number of layered kimono, made of heavily-decorated, often satin silk or silk brocade fabrics, which would then be belted with an tied at the front. During the Edo period, this became both wider and stiffer, adding weight and discomfort. Over the top of this outfit, an would wear an even heavier , a formal, heavily-decorated overcoat with a long train and a padded hem, worn unbelted over the top. When parading or otherwise walking outfit, wore - three-pronged, 20cm tall pauwlonia wood clogs. Though lightweight for their size, these would prevent an from taking anything other than small, slow footsteps when walking; would thus walk in with a sliding, figure-of-8 () step, with two manservants (known as ) assisting her. generally did not wear socks, with her bare foot considered to be a point of eroticism in her outfit. In total, a formal parade outfit worn by an could weigh in excess of 20kg, often weighing as much as 30kg, and would require great assistance to put on. =Decline= Because of their isolation and inability to leave the pleasure districts, became steadily more traditional, outdated and ritualised, further and further removed from popular society and bound by their strict rules of etiquette, behaviour and speech. This, combined with their relative financial inaccessibility, created a vacuum of entertainment for the rising merchant classes, whose relatively high wealth and relatively low social status left them unable to hire , thus leading to the decision to patronise the more-accessible and infinitely-cheaper geisha instead. Over time, also lost their celebrity status, and came in part to be seen less as highly-cultured courtesans reflecting formal, high-class standards of speech and appearance, and more as caged women unable to leave the pleasure districts and chained to the debts they owed to their brothel. The preservation of the appearance of had also not reflected changes in fashion - as the profession of geisha had evolved and become increasingly popular, the authorities had sought to clamp down on the proligate and wealthy tastes of the merchant classes, leading to a number of dress edicts that changed popular aesthetics and led to the rise of subdued and cultivated aesthetics such as , which categorically did not reflect or resemble. Similarly, the entertainment that offered had mostly remained unchanged since generations of courtesans previous. Though played the , they did not play the popular and contemporary tunes composed for it, and instead stuck to longer ballads such as , which had refined, but restrained, lyrical content. This was in contrast to the (lit. \\"short songs\\") favoured and song by geisha, whose lyrical content was often heartfelt and honest. =Competition with geisha= In the years that declined, the geisha profession was born and grew increasingly stronger, contributing in part, if not in majority, to this decline. Geisha were, officially-speaking, considered to be a relatively low-class form of entertainment, and as such, were not patronised by the upper classes, who were officially supposed to patronise instead; however, during the Edo period, geisha came to represent the tastes of the merchant classes, whose low social status and high financial freedom left them free of social obligations to uphold the status of a samurai family that men of the upper classes were commonly beholden to. As the merchant classes throughout Edo period society grew in wealth and profligacy, they became the main source of income for geisha, who represented social and financial accessibility in a way that did not. Geisha were cheap to patronise, informal to converse with, required few introductions before entertaining a customer and both played and sang the most popular songs of the time. Through various dress edicts aimed at controlling the merchant classes and thus preserving the appearances and social status of the upper classes, extravagant or obvious displays of wealth had been outlawed and driven underground, bringing aesthetics such as into popularity, which geisha came to both represent and champion. Though geisha also worked within the pleasure districts that did - at times forbidden to work outside of them - as the profession developed, laws regarding the separation of the two professions were passed. This, over time, ironically led to exaggerate and exacerbate the differences between geisha and , heightening the popularity of the former and leading to the eventual destruction of the latter. Geisha were forbidden to dress elaborately, in the manner of , and were not allowed to sleep with their customers. Geisha were registered at a separate registry office, and if an accused a geisha of stealing a customer, she would be fully investigated, with the potential to be forbidden from working if found guilty. Though geisha and were likely to be at least in part indentured to their houses, geisha were not considered to be the same kind of physical property that were considered to be by their employers. Though were unable to leave their pleasure quarters and could be, if not in the highest ranks, forced to entertain whichever customers the head of her brothel demanded she entertain, geisha were allowed to both leave their houses and choose which patrons she wished to entertain, leading to the rise of adages comparing the loyalties of an with square eggs, the punchline being that neither were things that existed. Though many geisha went into debt or held at least some debt with their , few found themselves in the same situation of financial domination and ownership that were almost entirely bound to. =Later years (1850-1957)= Towards the end of the Edo period, the continued to dwindle in popularity as the geisha grew in numbers and appeal. By the beginning of the Meiji period, official attitudes towards legalized prostitution within Japan had changed owing to the country's increasing international presence. Towards the end of the 19th century, geisha had replaced as the entertainer and companion of choice for the wealthiest in Japanese society, with the central appeal of having grown increasingly remote from everyday life. continued to see clients within the old pleasure quarters, but were no longer at the cutting edge of fashion, and during the years of World War II, when any show of luxury was heavily clamped down upon, the culture surrounding suffered even further, being dealt the final blow in 1957 by the Prostitution Prevention Law - after a which a time, the profession of courtesan as it once was, sex services and all, had become illegal. Modern  An in parade wearing distinctive high platform shoes continue to entertain in a similar manner to geisha, but no longer provide sex as part of this entertainment. There are fewer than five - in comparison to the three hundred geisha - left in modern-day Kyoto. The last remaining house is located in , which lost its official status as a in the late 20th century.Dalby, Liza. \\"Courtesans and Geisha – the Tayû\\". www.lizadalby.com Retrieved 3-11-2014.

A Schmidt–Newtonian telescope or Schmidt–Newton telescope is a catadioptric telescope that combines elements from both the Schmidt camera and the Newtonian telescope. In this telescope design, a spherical primary mirror is combined with a Schmidt corrector plate, which corrects the spherical aberration and holds the secondary mirror. The resulting system has less coma and diffraction effects than a Newtonian telescope with a parabolic mirror (which is free of spherical aberration but not free of coma) and a \\"spider\\" secondary mirror support. The design uses a 45° flat secondary mirror to view the image, as in a standard Newtonian telescope.  Advantages  Schmidt–Newtonian telescope from Meade Schmidt–Newtonian telescopes offer images with less coma than Newtonian telescopes of the same focal ratio (usually about half). The corrector plate also helps to seal the tube assembly from air currents, and provides mounting point for the diagonal mirror, eliminating the diffraction effects from a \\"spider\\" secondary support. The all-spherical surfaces are much easier to manufacture, especially in short focal ratios. Telescopes using this design typically have a short focal ratio of around f/4, making them well suited for astrophotography or CCD imaging. Schmidt–Newtonians also typically cost less than the more commonly produced Schmidt–Cassegrain telescopes since they don't have the added curved secondary mirror or the complicated primary mirror focusing mechanism found in most Schmidt–Cassegrain designs. Currently, Meade Instruments is the only commercial manufacturer of Schmidt–Newtonian telescopes, offering 6, 8, and 10-inch models on its LXD-75 \\"GO-TO\\" equatorial mount.

These systems can produce severe straight-line winds and occasionally tornadoes, causing major damage. They can also become derechos. Research The term \\"bow echo\\" was first used by Theodore Fujita in his May 1978 paper \\"Manual of Downburst Identification for Project NIMROD.\\"Bow Echo Prototype In 2004, research was done to better anticipate the formation of bow echoes, specifically the formation of bow echoes from weakly organized squall lines and supercells. Researchers determined that bow echoes were most likely to occur in weakly organized cells. A Midwest Bow Echo Workshop was held in 2007, at which meteorologists gathered to share their research to better understand bow echoes.Midwest Bow Echo Workshop Formation A bow echo is associated with squall lines or lines of convective thunderstorms. These echoes can range in size from 20 to 200 km, and have a life span of 3 to 6 hours. Bow echoes tend to develop when moderate to strong wind shear exists in the lower 2 to 3 km of the atmosphere. While similar to squall lines, bow echoes are smaller in scale and are moved by the wind inside them. They tend to push outward and after time die out. A bow echo also lowers the chance of a tornado being formed in the storm itself. The \\"bow shaped\\" echo is a result of focusing of the strong flow at the rear of the system.MetEd Registration Page Especially strong bow echoes that cause devastating damage all along the width of the storm are often called derechos. =Rear inflow jet= The formation of a bow echo requires a strong elevated rear inflow jet at mid-levels. The strength of the cold pool and mesohigh at the surface as well as warmer temperatures aloft due to convection works to create a mesolow at mid-levels which strengthens the jet. Upon reaching the edge of the convection the jet descends and spreads along the surface, generating straight-line winds. =Book end vortices= After the rear inflow jet has bowed the storm system, book end or line end vortices develop on either side of the jet. These vortices are similar in strength.AMS Glossary Due to the small size of the bow echo, the vortices help enhance the mid-level flow between them. This strengthens the rear inflow jet. The surface winds increase from the descending jet. As the life of the storm increases, the Coriolis force acts to intensify the cyclonic vortex and weaken the anticyclonic vortex. The system then develops an asymmetric comma-shaped echo. Some embedded tornadoes or gustnadoes develop within these vortices. Typical evolution of a thunderstorm radar echo (a) into a bow echo (b, c) and into a comma echo (d). Dashed line indicates axis of greatest potential for downbursts. Arrows indicate wind flow relative to the storm. Note regions of cyclonic rotation (C) and anticyclonic rotation (A); both regions, especially C, are capable of supporting tornado development in some cases. Strongest winds A bow echo west of the Chicago area Damaging straight-line winds often occur near the center of a bow echo. Damage from all severe thunderstorm winds accounts for half of all severe reports in the lower 48 states of the US, and is more common than damage from tornadoes. In a type of long-lived and powerful bow echo known as a derecho, wind speeds can reach up to or exceed 100 mph (160 km/h) and can produce a damage path extending for hundreds of miles.Questions and Answers about Damaging Winds: Basics Bow echoes are capable of producing straight-line winds that are just as strong as many tornadoes. Indeed, a strong bow echo will produce more widespread and intense damage than the majority of tornadoes. Also, bow echoes in the form of a line echo wave pattern create a favorable environment for tornadoes to form. The semiarid climate and rugged terrain in the interior west of the United States do not favour the development of bow echoes. However, on 21 April 2011, a bow echo associated with a fast-moving mid-tropospheric perturbation formed across the Great Salt Lake (GSL) in Utah, producing damaging winds along its path.Zhao et al. 2014: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/met.1455/abstract Notable bow echo storms In 1674, the city of Utrecht in the Netherlands was devastated by a storm now thought to have been a bow echo storm.

Puram, is a Central Government Employees residential colony in New Delhi. Named after the saint Sri Ramakrishna, it houses many high profile corporate houses. There are many educational institutions like Ramjas school, Blind school, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sec 8 & 2, Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Delhi Public School etc. History Map of Delhi showing location of R. K. Puram Rama Krishna Puram area was built in the second phase of the extension of New Delhi. Construction of R K Puram started in the late 1950s by acquiring land from Munirka farmers. Developed by CPWD to south-West of Secretariat Building, its development continued till the 1970s, when R. K. Puram was established. It mostly contains double-storeyed housing blocks, with 2-3 bedrooms apartments for central government officers. Som Vihar, named after Maj Som Nath Sharma, Param Vir Chakra, came up in the mid- eighties as a cooperative housing society for defence forces officers under the aegis of the Army Welfare Housing Organisation, in what is sometimes referred to as Sector 10. Some high-rise apartment blocks like Nivedita Kunj for senior officers were added in the 1990s. Gradually markets were added in each pocket, and schools and places of worship were also built. Today the area also house several houses of Government of India. Landmarks The area includes a number of important landmarks - Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sector 8, R.K Puram, Kerala School, Delhi in Sector-8, Rock Garden - Sector-7, Hope Hall Foundation School in Sector 7, Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram in Sector 12 and D.A.V.

Also, Sangam cinema hall is now renovated completely with two PVR multiplex screens and a range of restaurants. The complex also has a Starbucks outlet. The area also includes Kendriya Vidyalaya RK Puram Sector 2 and Sector 4. Each sector has an allocated space for a market complex comprising multiple shops. Some of the prominent market complexes are: * Sector 8 market - Famous for Supreme Bakery and a host of other shops ranging from mobile shops to departmental stores * Sector 9 market - With Sangam Complex (PVR and Starbucks) and PPC. * Sector 12 market * Sector 6, Mohan Singh market - Famous electronics shopping centre * Sector 1 market - famous for its chemist shops R. K. Puram is also famous for its two weekly markets. The Friday Market happens every Friday on the road connecting the Office Complex outside Sector-1 and Mohammadpur. The Sunday Market which takes place every Sunday takes up the entire road between Sector-6 and Sector-7. Both markets host stalls of all kinds including fruits and vegetables, spices, clothes, leather goods, kitchen utilities and so on. Prices are totally negotiable and customers bargaining with vendors have become a common sight. The weekly markets attract large crowds most of them belonging to the middle and lower economic groups . Overview It is one of the oldest and larger developments in Delhi built for housing Central Government employees. It is roughly rectangular, enclosed by Ring Road to the north, Outer Ring Road to the south facing Vasant Vihar, Rao Tula Ram Marg to the west and Africa Avenue to the east. The north-eastern corner of this area is a separate commercial centre called Madam Bhikaji Cama Place. It is subdivided into 13 \\"Sectors\\" which are named numerically from 1 to 13. Sector-13 is the only sector located on the other side of the Ring Road. Surprisingly, RK Puram does not have a Sector-11. All the sectors are characterised by wide colony roads, sprinkling of parks/common areas, excellent greenery and decent street lighting. RK Puram also has its fair share of religious places including Ayyappa Temple in Sector-1, St Thomas Church in Sector - 2, Gurudwara in Sec-3, famed Yoga Centre named Shri Siddha Gufa Yog Shikshan Kendra, Gurudwara in Sector-5 and Jain Mandir in Sector - 4, Malai Mandir and Kali Bari temple in Sector - 7 and Venketeswer Temple, Masjid Haji Langa in Sector-3. Apart from these, there are a number of temples, Gurudwaras, mosques and churches sprinkled across this area. Connectivity R. K.

Dubbed \\"Paparazzo Extraordinaire\\" by Newsweek and \\"the Godfather of the U.S. paparazzi culture\\" by Time magazine and Vanity Fair, he is regarded by Harper's Bazaar as \\"arguably the most controversial paparazzo of all time\\". He immortalized many celebrities out of the public eye and gained notice for his feuds with some of them, including Jacqueline Onassis and Marlon Brando. Despite the numerous controversies, Galella's work has been praised and exhibited in art galleries worldwide and he was cited by Andy Warhol as his favourite photographer. During his career, Galella has taken more than three million photographs of public figures. Biography A Bronx native of Italian heritage, Galella is son of an immigrant from Muro Lucano, Basilicata, and his mother, born in New Jersey, was daughter of immigrants from Benevento, Campania. After graduating high school, he won a two year scholarship at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn but turned it down due to his deficiencies in mathematics. Galella served as a United States Air Force photographer (1951-1955) during the Korean War and later attended the Art Center College of Design in Los Angeles, California, graduating with a degree in photojournalism in 1958. In his free time Galella took pictures of the stars arriving at film premieres, selling them to magazines like National Enquirer and Photoplay. He soon became known for his photographic approach, portraying famous people out of the spotlight. Galella's photographs can be seen in hundreds of publications including Time, Harper's Bazaar, Vogue, Vanity Fair, People, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, The New York Times and Life. In his in-home darkroom, Galella makes his own prints which have been exhibited at museums and galleries throughout the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in both New York City and San Francisco, the Tate Modern in London, and the Helmut Newton Foundation Museum of Photography in Berlin. In 2009, his father's hometown Muro Lucano made him an honorary citizen. Galella is the subject of a 2010 documentary film by Leon Gast entitled Smash His Camera. The film's title is a quote from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis directed to her security agent after Galella pursued her and her children through Central Park, New York. The documentary premiered at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, receiving the Grand Jury Award for Directing in the U.S. Documentary category, and was also well received at the 54th BFI London Film Festival prior to airing on the BBC throughout the United Kingdom and Europe. After retiring as a paparazzo, Galella is still active as a photographer at prominent culture events. He lives in Montville, New Jersey. Galella in 1988 Galella’s wife and business partner, Betty Burke Galella, died in her sleep on January 9, 2017, at her home in Montville;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?pid=183667525 she was 68 years old. Speaking of his wife, Galella said, \\"When Betty first purchased my photos for publication and granted me assignment credentials over the phone, I fell in love with her warm soft, loving voice. I met her in person for the first time, two years later, on Dec. 10, 1978, at the Kennedy Center for the premiere of 'Superman'. With one look at that beautiful girl, I said, 'I'm gonna marry you.' And five months later, we were. Once married, we became a team.\\" Betty was born in Somerset, Kentucky, raised in Arlington, and lived in Yonkers before moving to Montville in 1992.  Controversies  Galella was known for his obsessive treatment of Jacqueline Onassis and the subsequent legal battles associated with it. The New York Post called it \\"the most co-dependent celeb-pap[arazzi] relationship ever\\". The 1972 free-speech trial Galella v. Onassis resulted in a restraining order to keep Galella 50 yards (later changed to 25 feet) away from Mrs Onassis.Frank P. Hoy, Photojournalism: The Visual Approach, Prentice-Hall, 1986, p.206 He was found guilty of breaking this order four times and faced seven years in jail and a US$120,000 fine; later settling for a US$10,000 fine and surrendering his rights to photograph Jackie and her children. On June 12, 1973, actor Marlon Brando punched Galella in the face outside a restaurant in Chinatown in New York City, breaking the photographer's jaw and knocking out five of his teeth on the left side of his mouth. Galella had been following Brando, who was accompanied by Dick Cavett, to the restaurant after a taping of The Dick Cavett Show earlier that day. Galella hired lawyer Stuart Schlesinger to sue Brando and ultimately settled for US$40,000. Schlesinger reported in the 2010 documentary Smash His Camera that Galella received two-thirds, but only cared about getting the message out, \\"I don't want anyone to think they can go around punching me if I am taking their picture. Get that story out, not the money.\\"HBO,Smash His Camera Subsequently, the next time Galella chased Brando, he wore a football helmet. Galella once lost a tooth when he was beaten by Richard Burton's security guards. He unsuccessfully sued the actor. Elizabeth Taylor, who tended to be tolerant towards photographers, was often heard to mutter, \\"I'm going to kill Ron Galella!\\", although the actress would later use his photographs in her biography. Other targets included Elvis Presley, whose bodyguards slashed his tires, Brigitte Bardot, whose security staff hosed him down, and Sean Penn, who spat at him and reportedly punched him while being photographed with his then-wife Madonna. In spite of these controversies, art galleries across the world have valued his work for its artistic and socio- historical value. He was praised by Andy Warhol, who said: \\"My idea of a good picture is one that's in focus and of a famous person doing something unfamous. It's being in the right place at the wrong time. That's why my favorite photographer is Ron Galella\\". Art writer Glenn O'Brien defined him a \\"brilliant realist able to represent the world faithfully\\".

He later became a KGB agent, stationed in the United States. TASS reporter Pravdin was born in London, and lived at one time in the United States during the early twenties. His wife, Olga Pravdin, also served in the KGB. During the 1930s, Pravdin had been involved in killings and kidnappings in Europe for the KGB, including the assassination of Ignace Reiss, a GRU officer who defected in 1937. Reiss was caught by the NKVD in Switzerland, where he was killed as an object lesson to potential defectors. Pravdin disappeared after the murder. Later, during World War II, he turned up again in the United States where he served as a Soviet diplomat, Vladimir Sergeyvich Pravdin. Later, in the United States, Pravdin operated under cover as the head of TASS News Agency from 1944 to 1945. Among Pravdin's contacts while serving in the United States were Judith Coplon, Josef Katz, Bernard Schuster, and Josef Berger. In Washington, Pravdin, posing as a TASS reporter, made the acquaintance of such people as the famous correspondent Walter Lippmann and others. On one occasion, he met with a person with three children to offer money for certain unspecified information and who was code-named by the KGB as BLIN (\\"bliny\\" is Russian for \\"pancake\\"). In the plain language of the cable decrypt, BLIN was willing to provide information but declined to cooperate with the NKVD because the approach had been clumsy, but left open the possibility of future cooperation. From scraps of information about BLIN that arose from the brief breaking of the Russian code in the materials the U.S. known as the Venona project, the FBI concluded that BLIN \\"appears\\" to be I.F. Stone. However, Stone biographer Myra MacPherson has contended that the FBI was uncertain about whether BLIN was, in fact, Stone.Myra MacPherson, \\"All Governments Lie,\\" 2006. P. 323. She noted that unlike Stone, BLIN was identified as someone \\"whose true pro-Soviet sympathies were not known to the public....\\" The FBI also considered the possibility of Ernest K. Lindley, who better fit the profile of a \\"very prominent journalist\\" and/like Stone (and BLIN) had three children.Myra MacPherson, \\"All Governments Lie,\\" 2006. P. 322. Another cable indicated that BLIN was afraid of contact with Pravdin, lest he draw the attention of J. Edgar Hoover.The Venona Files Stone was already attacking J. Edgar Hoover frequently in 1943,Myra MacPherson, \\"All Governments Lie,\\" 2006. P. 181. and the FBI was of the view that \\"Stone is known to the bureau because of his hostile editorial comments made against the FBI as early as 1936.\\"Myra MacPherson, \\"All Governments Lie,\\" 2006. P. 184. Other connections In 1945, while he was serving as a senior adviser to the American delegation at the founding conference of the United Nations, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Harry Dexter White met with Pravdin and answered a series of questions about U.S. negotiating strategy and possible ways for Moscow to defeat or water down American postwar proposals. Pravdin left the United States and returned to the Soviet Union on 11 March 1946. Anatoliy Golitsyn, another Soviet defector in the 1960s, also claimed that Pravdin was active in Austria after World War II and often passed as a Frenchman.  Sources  * United States.

The series, intended as a replacement for The Box, was set in a luxury international hotel. The regular characters were the hotel workers and in each one-hour episode they hosted a new batch of glamorous guest-star hotel guests, and rather like a drama version of The Love Boat stories would focus on both the self-contained dramas of the passing guests and the ongoing problems of the hotel staff. The regular cast was headed by Terence Donovan as the hotel manager, and also included Carmen Duncan, George Spartels, and American actor Richard Lawson. The title sequence was shot on film at the then Old Melbourne Inn on Flemington Road, North Melbourne. This distinctive looking hotel building is now an accommodation hostel owned by RMIT University. Interior sequences were largely shot on video at Channel Ten's Nunawading studios, giving the series a soap opera look. Hotel Story was cancelled before it even went to air. Originally planned to run for at least 26 episodes, the series was cancelled after only seven episodes had been produced, and before any had been broadcast. In Melbourne, ATV-O ran full-page advertisements in newspapers on the day the first episode was shown, describing it as \\"The most discussed TV series produced this year\\", ending with \\"You be the judge\\".The Age, 13 July 1977, p.6 There was some positive feedback and while it was too late for Hotel Story itself, the concept was later revived for the series Holiday Island. Six of the seven episodes were shown in Sydney across two consecutive weeks from 27 December 1977. In 1978 actor June Salter won a Sammy Award for Best Actress in a Single TV Performance for her guest performance in one episode. Salter played the American head of a cosmetics firm, Annabelle Lee, a lesbian. Her main co-star was Jane Harders.Salter, June. June Salter: A Pinch of Salt.

It may be found in the main courses and streams, as well as in lakes and lagoons; it often shelters among stones and aquatic vegetation. In Spanish its common name is boga (sometimes augmentative bogón); in Brazil it is known as piapara. There is also a variant called piava and another called tres puntos (\\"three dots\\"). This species is also known by the technical synonym Curimatus obtusidens. The common name boga is applied to many other species of fish, usually unrelated to this one. Megaleporinus obtusidens has an elongated wide body, with a comparatively small head and a blunt mouth; its teeth are reminiscent of the incisors of Lagomorpha, whence the name of the genus (leporinus, \\"hare-like\\", as in Leporidae). Its basic colour is a light greenish-gray, with three rounded dark spots in mid-flank, which may not be visible in some specimens. In young individuals there are also eight broad vertical streaks, joined in the back and coming down to the middle line. The back, as usual in this habitat, is darker than the belly. The length and weight of the individuals are extremely variable according to the area, probably influenced by different feeding habits, opportunities and exploitation, as well as local sub-specific variants. In the Río de la Plata L. obtusidens is reported as weighing an average of 2 kg, with a maximum of 4 kg; in the upper course of the Paraná River it is about 4.5 kg; and in the middle course of the Paraná there are specimens of boga over 6 kg (with exceptionally developed ones over 8 kg). Adult individuals are reported between 40 and 80 cm long. The larger fish probably belong to other species of Leporinus (either L. friderici, which is still not very well known, or Megaleporinus macrocephalus, only recently classified as a separate species). Megaleporinus obtusidens is an omnivore: it eats water plants, crabs and river snails. However, it prefers grain and seeds (wheat and maize), and it often gathers in large banks near ports, where cargo ships drop grains into the water. It is preyed upon by larger fish like the surubí and the dorado. It prefers warm waters and reproduces in spring and summer, starting at 2 years of age. References  Cordiviola de Yuan, E. and C.

Animal numbers fell in droughts over the last two decades. The park actually has ten rhinos now with the latest calf being only a month and two weeks. The park before then contained two southern white rhino which are not indigenous and were imported from South Africa - they were both poached during the night of June 6, 2007. One was shot dead and got its horn extracted, not far from the gate and the other received serious bullet wounds but has triumphed against all odds and still lives in the park under twenty four hours surveillance. As of June, 2009 the number of southern white rhino in the park has been increased to five animals with plans to introduce further animals in due course.ZAWA( now called DNPW - Department of National Parks and WIldlife) 2009. The indigenous (black rhino) was believed extinct in Zambia but has recently been reintroduced in a pilot area) north luanwa national park. African elephants are often seen in the park when they cross the river in the dry season from the Zimbabwean side. Hippopotamus and crocodile can be seen from the river bank. Vervet monkeys and baboons are common as they are in the rest of the national park outside the wildlife section. As of January 2009 the commercial wildlife company, Lion Encounter, has been operating a \\"walking with Lions\\" experience within the park, with further plans to start a breeding program for lions within the soon to be expanded Dambwa Forest section of the park.African Impact, 2009 Within the wildlife park is the Old Drift cemetery where the first European settlers were buried. They made camp by the river, but kept succumbing to a strange and fatal illness. They blamed the yellow/green-barked \\"fever trees\\" for this incurable malady, while all the time it was the malarial mosquito causing their demise. Before long the community moved to higher ground and the town of Livingstone emerged.  The Falls section of the park  The Falls section of the national park includes the rainforest on the cliff opposite the Eastern Cataract which is sustained by spray from the falls. It contains plants rare for the area such as pod mahogany, ebony, ivory palm, wild date palm and a number of creepers and lianas. Small antelopes and warthogs inhabit this area, and may also be seen in on the paths through the riverine forest leading to the falls. In November 2005 a new statue of explorer David Livingstone was erected in the park (the original and more famous Livingstone statue is on the Zimbabwean side). A plaque was also unveiled on Livingstone Island to mark the spot from where Livingstone was the first European to see the falls.The Times of Zambia online: \\"David Livingstone remembered\\" , November 15, 2005 - November 23, 2005. Website accessed 26 April 2007. The Knife-Edge Bridge was constructed in this area in the 1960s to enable access on foot to the cliffs looking over the Rainbow Falls and the First Gorge's exit to the Boiling Pot in the Second Gorge. A steep footpath also goes down to the Boiling Pot, with views of the Second Gorge and the Victoria Falls Bridge. In the area directly before the river plunges over Victoria Falls, there is a small undeveloped stretch of the park which is currently the only riverfront location that can be accessed without paying a fee. It is a crucial location for elephants to cross the river. The tops of the deep gorges below the falls can be reached by road and walking tracks through the park and are good places to see klipspringers, clawless otters and 35 species of raptors such as the Taita falcon, black eagle, peregrine falcon and augur buzzard, which all breed there. Notes This park is considered for inclusion in the five-nation Kavango - Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area.

He left Labour in 1933 to join the BUF and set about organising the local branch in Derby.

It contains directives with criteria under which physicians can perform \\"active ending of life on infants\\" (child euthanasia) without fear of legal prosecution.Paediatricians call for nationwide protocol for the ending of life of unbearably and incurably suffering newborns - 10 December 2004Murder or health care: the Groningen Protocol Origin The protocol was created by a committee of physicians and others at the University Medical Center Groningen, in consultation with the Groningen district attorney, and has been ratified by the Dutch National Association of Pediatricians. According to its authors, the Groningen Protocol was developed in order to assist with the decision making process when considering actively ending the life of a newborn, by providing the information required to assess the situation within a legal and medical framework. In July 2005 the Protocol was declared to be mandatory by the Dutch Society for Pediatrics. Richtlijn Levensbeëindiging bij pasgeborenen, actieve Protocol The protocol, drawn up after extensive consultation between physicians, lawyers, parents and the Prosecution Office, offers procedures and guidelines to achieve the correct decision and performance. The final decision about \\"active ending of life on infants\\" is not in the hands of the physicians but with the parents, with physicians and social workers agreeing to it. Criteria are, amongst others, \\"unbearable suffering\\" and \\"expected quality of life\\". Only the parents may initiate the procedure. The procedure is reported to be working well. For the Dutch public prosecutor, the termination of a child's life (under age 1) is acceptable if four requirements were properly fulfilled: #The presence of hopeless and unbearable suffering. #The consent of the parents to termination of life. #Medical consultation having taken place. #Careful execution of the termination. Doctors who end the life of a baby must report the death to the local medical examiner, who in turn reports it to both the district attorney and to a review committee. The procedure differs in this respect from the black letter law governing voluntary euthanasia. There, the medical examiner sends the report only to the regional review committee, which alerts the district attorney only if it judges that the physician acted improperly. Legal status The Dutch euthanasia laws require people to ask for euthanasia themselves (voluntary euthanasia), and it is legal for people of 12 years and older. In the Netherlands, euthanasia remains technically illegal for patients under the age of 12. The Groningen Protocol does not give physicians unassailable legal protection. Case law has so far protected physicians from prosecution as long as they act in accordance with the protocol, but no black-letter law exists in this area. Review In 2005 a review study was undertaken of all 22 reported cases between 1997 and 2004. All cases concerned newborns with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. In all cases, at least 2 doctors were consulted outside the medical team. In 17 of 22 cases, a multidisciplinary spina bifida team was consulted. All parents consented to the termination of life; in 4 cases they explicitly requested it. The mean time between reporting of the case and the decision concerning prosecution was 5.3 months. None of the cases led to prosecution. The study concluded that all cases of active termination of life reported were found to be in accordance with good practice. Reception The protocol is controversial and has been attacked by anti-euthanasia campaigner Wesley J. Smith, Senior Fellow at the Discovery Institute, who described it as little more than an attempt to legalize infanticide. Several studies have questioned the basis for the protocol and have recommended abandoning it; however, bioethicist Jacob M. Appel of New York University has said that the protocol is a success and should be expanded. Hilde Lindemann and Marian Verkerk said that the policy must be evaluated in the context of Dutch culture and medicine, but Eric Kodish has harshly criticized the protocol and its premises in an article published in The Lancet. Kodish concluded by inviting resistance to the protocol by means of civil disobedience against the medical institutionalization of infanticide.

It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on December 17, 1997. This episode marks the first appearances of Craig Tucker, Mr. Hankey, and the school counselor Mr. Mackey. In the episode, the Jewish character Kyle feels excluded from the town's celebrations during Christmas, and is comforted by Mr. Hankey, a talking and singing lump of feces wearing a red hat. Mr. Hankey does not come alive in the presence of other characters, so they think that Kyle is delusional. In another plot strand, the townspeople remove all religious aspects of Christmas from South Park to remain politically correct and inoffensive. The episode was written and directed by the series' co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea from Parker's childhood; when Parker and Stone conceived the South Park series, they wanted to make Mr. Hankey the lead character. Heavily influenced by the Peanuts Christmas special A Charlie Brown Christmas from 1965, \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was the first South Park (fully animated series) Christmas Special episode, the first musical episode, and the only episode in season one (and therefore the first time in the series) in which Kenny does not die. It was a satire of political correctness and religious sensitivity. The episode received generally positive reviews and has been described as one of the classic South Park episodes. It was viewed in about 4.5 million households during its original broadcast, the highest Nielsen rating to that date for South Park and the fourth-highest overall for a basic cable entertainment program of 1997. In addition to Mr. Hankey himself, the episode introduced the popular South Park songs \\"A Lonely Jew on Christmas\\" and \\"Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch\\". John Kricfalusi, the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, accused Parker and Stone of stealing the idea for Mr. Hankey from him, which the duo vehemently denied. Plot Kyle is playing Saint Joseph in the South Park Elementary School's Christmas nativity play, but he is forced to quit when his mother hears of the play and expresses outrage that her Jewish son is being forced to participate in a Christian production. She demands that the religious elements be taken out of the public school, and threatens to take her case to the mayor. Kyle suggests he could sing the \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" song as a non-religious substitute, but his suggestion is rejected because nobody else believes in Mr. Hankey, a living and talking \\"Christmas Poo\\". Kyle leaves the school feeling lonely and excluded because he cannot celebrate Christmas with everyone else. Mayor McDaniels decides that anything offensive to anyone will be removed from the Christmas celebrations, including Santa Claus, Christmas trees, wreaths, fairy lights, candy canes, mistletoe and the Star of Bethlehem. Kyle once again tries to suggest that they use Mr. Hankey as a non-religious Christmas icon since he does not discriminate against anyone. At home, Kyle is scolded by his parents for believing in Mr. Hankey. While Kyle is brushing his teeth, Mr. Hankey comes out of the toilet, singing \\"Carols\\" and writing words, like \\"Noel\\" on the mirror and spreading feces stains everywhere he goes, prompting Kyle's father to blame Kyle for the mess and as added punishment, to think about his \\"poor mother stuck cleaning up this mess*. Kyle decides he will bring Mr. Hankey to school to prove he is real, but this only causes more problems as Mr. Hankey disguises himself as an unadorned, dried-out piece of feces when he is around people who do not believe in him, leading Cartman to ask if carrying around boxes with feces in them is some kind of Jewish tradition. Mr. Hankey leaps at Cartman's face as he sings \\"Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch\\" in D Minor, and Kyle is blamed. He is sent to talk to guidance counselor, Mr. Mackey, but Kyle only gets into further trouble when Mr. Hankey takes a bath in Mr. Mackey's coffee. Eric, Stan, and Kenny believe Kyle is insane, diagnosed as an Acute Fecalphilliac on Prozac, and take him into a mental institution where Kyle is hastily committed. Like the whole town, the school Christmas pageant is stripped of all symbols of Christmas, and the children instead present a minimalist song and dance created by composer Philip Glass. The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When Chef finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight of the good things of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle feel that something is still missing. \\"THE END\\" then appears, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life-threatening situations throughout. (This would not happen again until \\"Rainforest Shmainforest.\\") During the end credits, Jesus dejectedly sings, \\"Happy Birthday\\" to himself alone in his television studio. Production =Conception and early history= The Mr. Hankey character was based on an idea Trey Parker's father created when he was toilet-training Trey as a child. Parker said he refused to flush the toilet as a child, so his father told him if he did not flush down his stool, which he called \\"Mr. Hankey\\", it would come to life and kill him. The concept stayed with Parker throughout his childhood; starting in elementary school and throughout his entire education, he would often draw the character in class, wearing a sailor's hat instead of the Santa Claus hat he would later wear in South Park. Parker shared the concept with future South Park co-creator Matt Stone when the two met at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and the duo immediately knew they wanted to create a film or production involving Mr. Hankey. The two discussed filming a three-minute short film involving a boy who befriended the talking stool, but Mr. Hankey would not come alive for anybody else, prompting others to believe the boy was crazy. They planned for the boy's parents to find him holding a stool in the bathroom and blame the child for smearing feces along the walls when it was actually Mr. Hankey's fault; they also planned to have him visit a school counselor, where Mr. Hankey would leap into the counselor's coffee mug and the boy would be blamed. At the end, it would turn out that the boy was indeed crazy and Mr. Hankey was not real at all, but a figment of the boy's imagination. Parker and Stone never made the short film, but practically all of its elements were included in the future South Park episode \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", with the notable exception of the ending. Although the Mr. Hankey short film was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related animated short films called The Spirit of Christmas, which served as precursors to the South Park series. After the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone conceived the idea of an adult-animated show with four children as main protagonists, and one of the minor characters included a talking stool named Mr. Hankey. They contacted the Fox Broadcasting Company about the show's concept, and the network arranged a meeting with the duo at its office in Century City to discuss how it would proceed. However, Parker and Stone said during the meeting that FOX didn't like a talking poo character on its network and demanded the duo to remove him, which they refused. When FOX continued to stand by its decision (and supported by sister company 20th Century Fox Television, the show's original developer), the duo cut ties with the network and began pitching the series somewhere else. After Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, \\"One thing we have to know before we really go any further: how do you feel about talking poo?\\" The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The elements of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children get beat up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew and so he did not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated. =Episode production= South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone wrote \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\"\\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was written and directed by Parker and Stone, and first aired in the United States on Comedy Central on December 17, 1997. It was the first official South Park Christmas episode. Television journalists said the Spirit of Christmas shorts were precursors to Mr. Hankey and that they shared some common traits, but that the television episode was considered tamer and more tasteful. Parker and Stone originally conceived the episode \\"Damien\\", which involves a boxing match between Jesus and Satan, as the first season's Christmas episode. Although they had long planned to feature Mr. Hankey in the show, they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of \\"Damien\\". Once they made the decision, they decided to make \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" the holiday episode instead; although it would not air until after the \\"Mr. Hankey\\" episode, Parker and Stone finished production of \\"Damien\\" before working on \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\". At the time they were writing the episode, Parker and Stone had seen a large number of news reports about government buildings refusing to allow the display of models of the nativity scene and other Christian holiday symbols, in an effort not to offend other religions. Parker and Stone, as two agnostics who still appreciated the Christmas holiday, said they felt the idea was \\"ridiculous\\" and, according to Stone, \\"We just wanted Mr. Hankey to say Christmas was about good and about presents, and it doesn't have to be this religious [controversy].\\" The two sought to write an episode in the tradition of old classic Christmas specials with their own irreverent South Park twist, and so they watched the famous 1965 Peanuts special, A Charlie Brown Christmas, repeatedly during the production process. Parker said, \\"At this point, we just sort of wanted to do a Charlie Brown Christmas South Park version. That [special] was definitely a huge part of my life growing up.\\" The episode was considered the first South Park musical episode, and included such songs as \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", \\"A Lonely Jew on Christmas\\" and \\"Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch\\". Parker and Stone were initially concerned about making a musical because, Parker said, \\"The general rule was people hated musicals\\". For the Mr. Hankey character, Parker and Stone adapted most of the elements from the Mr. Hankey short film they planned in college, except that Mr. Hankey would prove to be real, not a figment of Kyle's imagination. Parker said this was decided because of his frustration with the character Mr. Snuffleupagus in the children's show Sesame Street; for his first 14 years on the show, Mr. Snuffleupagus was an imaginary character seen only by Big Bird, which Parker said \\"really bummed me out\\". Parker and Stone felt Mr. Hankey should embody the wholesomeness and morals of cartoons from the 1930s, so they designed him to resemble the version of Mickey Mouse in the 1928 cartoon Steamboat Willie, particularly in his eyes. For the scenes in which Mr. Hankey smears feces wherever he walks, the animators scanned images of spread out chocolate and fudge and inserted those images into the episode. Parker and Stone had trouble deciding on a voice for Mr. Hankey, but Stone said it came to him while eating a Sausage McMuffin at a McDonald's in New York City, while taking a break from promoting South Park to the press. Although Comedy Central did not object to most aspects of the episode, they did require some edits to material they deemed potentially offensive. During rehearsal for a Nativity play, a baby Jesus resembling a fetus pops out of Wendy, who is playing the Virgin Mary, and is caught by Kyle, who is portraying Joseph of Nazareth. Although the scene was ultimately kept in the episode, Comedy Central executives had problems with it and Parker said they had to handle its animation \\"very carefully\\". Additionally, during filming of the live-action Mr. Hankey commercial, the baby originally held the Mr. Hankey stool and took a bite out of it. Comedy Central officials would not allow the scene in the episode and it was changed to portray the idea that the baby had already eaten the stool off-camera, which Parker said he felt was actually funnier. \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" is the first episode in which Kenny was not killed. Parker and Stone deliberately included several scenes that looked like they might lead to Kenny's death, but they decided because it was Christmas that they would not kill him (though he would later go on to be killed in several subsequent Christmas episodes). The episode was also the first time Mr. Garrison was portrayed as an anti-semite and racist, particularly when he asks Mayor McDaniels if she can get rid of all the Mexicans in South Park. Parker said this decision was made because, \\"Garrison at that point had already shown himself to be the most messed up person in the entire town, and there's obviously so much wrong with him mentally. A person that disturbed being a racist is funny to us.\\" =Home video and soundtrack release= \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was released, along with 11 other episodes, in a three-DVD set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes \\"Starvin' Marvin\\", \\"Mecha-Streisand\\" and \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\". \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was also one of six episodes included on a 1998 VHS called \\"South Park Festival Special\\", which included \\"Starvin' Marvin\\", \\"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\\", \\"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\\", \\"Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery\\" and \\"Pinkeye\\". It was later released in the November 2007 DVD release \\"Christmas Time in South Park\\", which also included the episodes, \\"Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!\\", \\"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\\", \\"A Very Crappy Christmas\\", \\"Red Sleigh Down\\", \\"It's Christmas in Canada\\" and \\"Woodland Critter Christmas\\". The episode, along with the other 12 from the first season, was also included in the DVD release \\"South Park: The Complete First Season\\", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary track for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to \\"standards\\" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD completely separately from the DVDs. Songs from \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" were featured in the October 2007 CD soundtrack release called \\"Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics\\". The Birmingham News said the album \\"gleefully tramples on one of America's most cherished holidays [and] will likely make even cynical listeners gasp\\". Themes \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" is a satire on political correctness and religious sensitivity, particularly in its portrayal of the characters organizing \\"The Happy, Non-Offensive, Non-Denominational Christmas Play\\" to avoid offending anyone of any religious backgrounds. While many Christmas specials focus on the religious, spiritual and moral values of the Christmas holiday rather than the commercial aspects, \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" actually embraces commercialism in Christmas, suggesting viewers should enjoy those elements of the holiday without taking religion too seriously. York University Professor Alison Halsall said of this aspect of the episode, \\"Again, Parker and Stone blur the sacred and the profane, in this instance, to gut holidays of their traditional meanings.\\" The episode has also been described as simultaneously embracing and parodying animated Christmas specials like A Charlie Brown Christmas, Frosty the Snowman and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown. It has also been described as a commentary on the way Jewish children are overlooked during the Christmas holiday; this theme is overtly stated by Stan, who says at the end of the episode that Jews and Hanukkah \\"can be cool\\" as well as Christmas. M. Keith Booker, author of Drawn to Television: Prime-Time Animation from The Flintstones to Family Guy, said although the episode is irreverent in its treatment of Christmas, \\"even if spearheaded by a singing turd, [it] is about as close as South Park ever comes to being sentimental and nostalgic\\". Literary critic Mark Caldwell said the fact that Kenny survived the episode demonstrates the episode's \\"strong, albeit dutifully ironic, undercurrent of conventional holiday decency.\\" Alison Halsall said \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" is the strongest example of a history of scatology, the study of excrement, throughout the South Park series. Halsall said the use of fecal matter as a character, and especially its tendency to smear parts of itself around as it moved, directly confronts the viewer with \\"the inherent dirtiness of the human body, no matter how much we try to aestheticize it, Mr. Hankey's stains systematically mess up the cleanliness of the social order. [...] South Park refuses sanitization through the gross-out factor.\\" Cultural impact and references Some writers consider Mr. Hankey one of the most easily recognizable and popular of the non-regular South Park characters. His high-pitched greeting, \\"Howdy-ho\\", was equally recognizable and became one of the most quoted lines from the show's first season. Several fan websites were made about the character within months of the episode's broadcast. In January 1998, Entertainment Weekly reported that Comedy Central executives had plans to produce a Mr. Hankey chocolate bar. Larry Lieberman, the channel's vice president of strategic planning and new business development, said a sketch of a Mr. Hankey candy bar was drawn and circulated, but mainly as a joke; he said no serious discussions were held about producing such an item. A stuffed Mr. Hankey became one of the most popular South Park tie-in products of the 1998 Christmas season. In addition to the title character, \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" included the first appearances of characters Father Maxi and Mr. Mackey. Both characters appeared in \\"Damien\\", which was produced before \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", but the Christmas episode aired first. Mr. Mackey was inspired by Parker's real- life school guidance counselor; Parker, who provides the voice for Mackey, said the real-life counselor was similarly thin and wiry and that Parker's voice for Mr. Mackey is an exact, unexaggerated version of how his counselor spoke. \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" includes several references to the Peanuts holiday special, A Charlie Brown Christmas. A Christmas pageant features the same biblical quote spoken by Linus in that special; additionally, the music featured in the pageant is very similar to the Peanuts special's musical score by Vince Guaraldi, and the South Park kids go outside to catch falling snowflakes on their tongues in the same way as in the special. A doctor prescribes Prozac, a real life antidepressant, to Kyle for his apparent love for feces, which he describes as \\"fecalphilia\\", a condition perhaps better known by the medical term coprophilia. Composer Philip Glass composes the avant-garde musical score for the non-denominational Christmas play. Stone and Parker both strongly dislike Glass; Parker, who was a music major in college, said, \\"I really thought you could basically tell a third grader to sit down at a keyboard and mess around and sell it as a Philip Glass album, and no one would know the difference.\\" The do-it-yourself kit in the live action commercial, in which families can make their own Mr. Hankey, is similar to the Mr. Potato Head toy set. Slack, the popular messaging software, also uses the word \\"hankey\\" as a shortcut for the Pile of Poo emoji. Reception =Reviews and ratings= Although Parker and Stone credit \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\" as helping elevate the series, they felt \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" elevated South Park to a new level of popularity and relevance. Parker said of it, \\"This was the episode that just vaulted everything.\\" Following the success of \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\", a large number of celebrities started contacting Comedy Central with the hopes of making guest appearances in South Park episodes. This allowed Parker and Stone to practically take their pick of guest stars, and led to appearances by Natasha Henstridge in \\"Tom's Rhinoplasty\\" and Robert Smith in \\"Mecha- Streisand\\". Stone said although \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" has become less shocking with time, viewers at the time of the episode's original broadcast were shocked, and some were horrified, at the idea of a living and speaking Christmas stool. \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was the fourth- highest overall basic cable entertainment program of 1997. In its original American broadcast, the episode received a Nielsen Rating of 5.4, meaning the episode was seen by about 4.5 million households. The rating was the highest yet for South Park, and was more than seven times the Comedy Central prime- time average. The episode also earned a 51 share of the male demographic aged between 18 and 24; a share represents the percentage of households using a television at the time the program is airing. \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" has been described as one of the classic episodes of South Park. Chris Vognar of The Dallas Morning News described Mr. Hankey himself as \\"the most outrageous character yet on TV's most outrageous show\\". Charlie Patton of The Florida Times-Union said the episode was \\"crude, nasty, irreverent and generally offensive—also extremely funny\\". He also said of the Mr. Hankey character, \\"If you're the sort of person who didn't care for that scene in Trainspotting where the Ewan McGregor character dove down the toilet and into the sewer in pursuit of his lost suppository, the whole Mr. Hankey subplot is going to be deeply disturbing.\\" Doug Pratt, a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor, said, \\"Technically, the Christmas episode might well be the show's best effort, artistically, because it tackles the PC-ification of Christmas head-on, and also has an interesting psychological subtext: does the hero actually see Mr. Hankey, or does he have some serious psychological problems?\\" Diane Werts of Newsday said of the episode, \\"It's gross. It's yucky. It's probably offensive. It's also possibly the funniest holiday episode anybody's airing this year.\\" Werts particularly praised the song \\"A Lonely Jew on Christmas\\". Jeffrey Andrew Weinstock, author of Taking South Park Seriously, said, \\"This episode arguably pushes the boundaries of what is acceptable, both for Christmas specials and television in general, farther than any previous one.\\" Weinstock said this was particularly true of the episode's fake live-action commercial. Before the episode was released, Debbie Liebling, then-Comedy Central vice president of development and production, herself described the episode as \\"adorably offensive\\". Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger called the episode \\"a brilliant skewering\\" of political correctness and over-sensitivity, and called it \\"at once hilariously satiric and extraordinarily foul.\\" Sepinwall also added Mr. Hankey to his 1997 list of most memorable TV moments, describing the character as the year's \\"most disturbing cartoon image\\" and as \\"a mythical holiday creature so bizarre and offensive it literally cannot be described in a family newspaper\\". Matt Roush of USA Today praised the episode, which he described as \\"ribald, raunchy and riotous\\". A.J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly said in January 1998 that the episode was \\"already infamous\\". Jacobs also said Mr. Hankey was so popular, he half-jokingly suggested Matt Stone and Trey Parker pursue a spin-off revolving around the character. The music in \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" was also praised. \\"A Lonely Jew on Christmas\\" has been described as a \\"classic song\\", and \\"Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat Bitch\\", which reviewers described as one of Cartman's trademarks, was included in the 1999 South Park film, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut. Not all reviews of \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" were positive. Rick Marin of Newsweek described the episode as \\"simply one long potty joke\\". Virginia Rohan of The Record said he liked Kyle's song and some of Kenny's antics, but said the episode was not as funny as The Spirit of Christmas shorts. Rohan said South Park \\"can be brilliantly over the edge, but often tonight, it sorely needs a comic bungee cord\\". In 2003, the Chicago- based RedEye ranked \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" the greatest South Park episode. In October 2004, the Comedy Central website held a poll to determine the top 27 South Park episodes for a television marathon; \\"Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" came third, just behind \\"Good Times with Weapons\\" at #2 and \\"Fat Butt and Pancake Head\\" at #1. South Park Studios, the official South Park website, listed \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" at number four on its list of the Five Most Notorious Episodes. =Ren & Stimpy controversy= John Kricfalusi, the creator of The Ren & Stimpy Show, claimed the Mr. Hankey concept was stolen from his cartoon short, \\"Nutty the Friendly Dump\\", which was part of a cartoon book series viewable online. Kricfalusi even confirmed that he pitched the idea for an animated series of \\"Nutty the Friendly Dump\\" to Comedy Central, who turned it down. Kricfalusi said after the show aired, \\"I got nine or 10 messages from friends screaming, 'I can't believe this! They totally stole your story!' ... This idea of [feces] singing or dancing and being friends, well, that is my idea.\\" Kricfalusi said he felt other elements of South Park were lifted from his work, and he told media outlets his company Spümcø was contemplating taking legal action against Parker and Stone. Comedy Central spokesman Tony Fox said Stone and Parker were not familiar with \\"Nutty the Friendly Dump\\" and that the claim was \\"ludicrous\\". Parker said he had never seen more than half an episode of Ren & Stimpy, which he said he did not enjoy because the characters were too over-the-top and the voice acting was too annoying. Parker said Kricfalusi eventually contacted the South Park creators: \\"He wrote a letter back saying, 'Oh, OK, I see how it could just be a coincidence, but you should just admit to the press that you're a big Ren and Stimpy fan.' — I'm not a Ren and Stimpy fan.\\" References External links * * Category:1997 American television episodes Category:Christmas characters Category:Christmas television episodes Category:Christmas television specials Category:Criticism of political correctness Category:Portrayals of Jesus on television Category:South Park (season 1) episodes Category:Works about feces ","title":"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo"},{"id":"2591769","text":"Jean de Dieu Ntiruhungwa is the former minister of the interior of Rwanda.Journalist murdered in Kigali Reporters Without Borders, 15 March 2002 He became minister of the interior in 2001.

Okolehao's forerunner was a fermented ti root beverage or beer. When distillation techniques were introduced by English seamen in 1790, it was distilled into a highly alcoholic spirit. Hawaiians discovered that if the ti root is baked, a sweet liquid migrates to the surface of the root. Chemically, the heat changes the starch in the root to a fermentable sugar. The baked root is then soaked in a vat of water which dissolves the sugar, and fermentation begins. The fermented drink was later distilled into a highly alcoholic spirit which became Hawaii's only indigenous distilled spirit, and was prized by the king. The Merrie Monarch, King David Kalakaua, is said to have had his own distiller. Etymology The name is from the iron try pots that were brought ashore from sailing ships and converted into stills, and literally meant \\"iron butt\\", from Hawaiian ʻōkole (\\"butt\\") + hao (\\"iron\\"). History After the initial production of okolehao in 1790, Hawaiians added sugar cane as another fermentable. When pineapple was introduced, this too was sometimes added for its sugar content. When Japanese and Chinese immigrants arrived to work in the sugarcane and pineapple fields they brought with them their native rice. The propagated rice was also sometimes added to the formula. By the beginning of World War II Hawaiians were producing okolehao of various formulations, all of which were sold to US military personnel located at the many bases in Hawaii. Spirit alcohol made from grains was rationed during the war and used for fuel by the military forces; the resulting shortage was good for okolehao sales, but encouraged many hastily produced inferior products. When the war was over, the production of okolehao gradually died out as rum and vodka became readily available and better-tasting than the crude okolehao then being produced. Just as moonshine on the mainland was produced using various formulas, okolehao was produced using various fermentable ingredients. Aging in used whiskey barrels improved the flavor, though this was rarely done. While the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives once recognized okolehao as a unique class, like vodka, gin, bourbon, tequila, whiskey, liqueur, etc., it is now recognized as a distilled spirits specialty (DSS), which requires the producer or distiller to submit the exact ingredients and general formula to the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) and include a truthful and adequate statement of composition on the label. For the short time okolehao was legally made in Hawaii after the war and into the sixties, the state of Hawaii granted okolehao a reduced tax rate. That reduced tax was ruled by the US federal government to be illegal due to discriminatory taxation of a spirit product. Current production Island Distillers in Honolulu makes 100-US- proof (50% Alcohol by volume) Hawaiian Okolehao, a re-creation of the original okolehao. There have been several past and recent productions of an okolehao type liqueur which is made by blending extracts of ti plant root, or ground up and emulsified ti root, with sugar syrup, rum, neutral spirits, bourbon, and other artificial and natural flavorings. Liqueurs are generally sweet from the heavy sugar addition, and are considered rectified spirits rather than distilled spirits. They are between 60 and 80 US proof, and taste much like a sweet fruit brandy, bearing little resemblance to the original okolehao. True or original-style okolehao generally had alcohol content in the range of 85–100 proof, dependent on the efficiency of the distillation process. The finished product was determined at the point the moonshiner decided that their okolehao had the right \\"hit\\" or \\"punch\\". Some full-strength okolehaos were and are made at a proof up to 130 proof, 65% alcohol by volume, the proof obtainable by most illegal pot stills in a single pass. Description \\"Original\\", \\"real\\" okolehao taste depends primarily on the formula used, and the fermentation and distillation methods employed. As with all spirits, aging in oak barrels can produce a different flavor profile, but this is rarely done. Okolehao, like other moonshines from elsewhere, is usually consumed un- aged. Earthy, vegetal, hints of banana or pineapple, indeterminate tropical flavor: these adjectives and more have all been used to describe the original okolehao taste. It is a spirit unique to Hawaii, with a flavor of its own. Cocktails Okolehao is used as the main ingredient in a few cocktails, including the Chief's Calabash and the Lei Day cocktail. The Lei Day recipe from a 1947 edition of Honolulu Magazine calls for 1 jigger of okolehao, 1/2 jigger of Crème de Menthe, and a 1/4 jigger of absinthe (legal in Hawaii at the time). Despite its Hawaiian origins, it is not commonly used in tiki drinks, likely because it was hard to get in California during the early days of Don the Beachcomber. Hawaiian bartender Harry Yee is attributed with inventing the Hot Buttered Okolehao, which may have been similar to Trader Vic's Hot buttered rum. No recipes listing okolehao appeared in either of Trader Vic's drink guides. It is however sometimes used in Scopion Bowls served in Hawaii, a nod to authenticism and the Scorpion cocktail's historical roots. Tiki drink expert Jeff Berry lists a recipe similar to Vic's Scorpion and Kava Bowls named the Polynesian Paralysis, among others. The cocktail calls for 3 oz. okolehao, 3 oz. orange juice, 3 oz. unsweetened pineapple juice, and 3/4 oz. lemon juice along with orgeat syrup and other sweeteners blended with crushed ice. In addition it has been used as a gin substitute in the Bee's Knees. Pop culture references On 3/7/1927, Sol Hoopii's Novelty Trio recorded 'Hula Blues', which became and has remained a very popular recording. It is a hapa-haole song, composed by two other famous Hawaiians, Sonny Cunha and Johnny Noble. The lyrics can be heard as a paean to okolehao: 'Oh, oh, oh-oh, the hula blues,/Tell me have you ever heard those hula blues./You can't imagine what you feeling blue about,/You simply get so full of pep you're starting to shout;/She wriggles and giggles and wiggles to those hula blues.//We want her, we crave her, we love her, okolehao./Oh, we want her, we crave her, we want her, okolehao, and now./You talk about your whisky, gin or wine;/There’s something makes you feel so dog-gone fine./Oh, we love her, we crave her, we want her, okolehao.'. \\"Hawaiian Hospitality\\", a 1936 hit by Honolulu musicians Harry Owens and Ray Kinney, includes the line \\"When my dream of love comes true/There'll be okolehao for two.\\" The beverage was a key ingredient in Hawaiian festivals such as the luau. In Hawaii 5-0 air date December 17, 2012, Chin's uncle makes Ti root moonshine. In Operation Pacific, a 1951 John Wayne movie, when Wayne's submarine crew get arrested for crashing and busting up a luau with the local Hawaiians asking for damages beyond Wayne's budget, he finds out the locals had illegal \\"okoolihau\\" which caused his men to get drunk. Wayne counters with a fine of equal amount to the damages to get them off the hook. In \\"Think Fast, Mr. Moto\\" during a trip on an ocean liner to Hawaii, one of the guests asks the bartender what to order. He suggests a Panther's Kiss. He says it contains Okoolihao. In the first Charlie Chan novel, The House Without a Key, a steward tells a main character, arriving from Boston, to \\"Keep away from the okolehau [sic].

It took place at Războieni, also known as Valea Albă, on July 26, 1476, between the Moldavian army of Ştefan cel Mare and an invading Ottoman army which was commanded personally by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror. Background In 1475 the Ottoman's attempt to bring Moldavia under their control, at winter by using an army of Rumelian local levies, ended disastrously with a defeat in the Battle of Vaslui. During the proper military campaign season, the Ottomans assembled a large army under the command of Sultan Mehmed II and entered Moldavia in June 1476. Meanwhile, groups of Tartars from the Crimean Khanate (the Ottomans' recent ally) were sent to attack Moldavia. Romanian sources may state that they were repelled.M. Barbulescu, D. Deletant, K. Hitchins, S. Papacostea, P. Teodor, Istoria României (History of Romania), Ed. Corint, Bucharest, 2002, , p. 157 Other sources state that joint Ottoman and Crimean Tartar forces \\"occupied Bessarabia and took Akkerman, gaining control of the southern mouth of the Danube. Stephan tried to avoid open battle with the Ottomans by following a scorched-earth policy.\\"Shaw, Stanford J. (1976) History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey – Vol 1: Empire of Gazis, Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, p.68 In the process the Moldavians forces ended up being dispersed throughout the country, leaving only a small force of about 12–20.000 men, led by Ştefan cel Mare himself, to face the main Ottoman attack. The battle The battle began with the Moldavians luring the main Ottoman forces into a forest that was set on fire, causing some casualties to the attacking Ottoman army in the forest. According to another battle description, the defending Moldavian forces repelled several attacks with steady fire from hand-guns. Akademia, Rolul distinctiv al artileriei în marile oşti moldoveneşti (The special role of artillery in the larger Moldavian armies), April 2000 The attacking Ottoman Janissaries were forced to crouch on their stomachs instead of charging headlong into the defenders' positions. Seeing the imminent defeat of his forces, Mehmed charged with his personal guard against the Moldavians, managing to rally the Janissaries, and turning the tide of the battle. Ottoman Janissaries penetrated inside the forest and engaged the defenders in man-to-man fighting. The Moldavian army was utterly defeated (casualties were very high on both sides, and the chronicles say that the entire battlefield was covered with the bones of the dead, a probable source for the toponym (Valea Albă is Romanian and Akdere Turkish for \\"The White Valley\\"). Aftermath Ştefan cel Mare retreated into the north-western part of Moldavia or even into the Polish Kingdom Jurnalul Naţional, Calendar 26 iulie 2005.Moment istoric (Anniversaries on July 26, 2005.A historical moment) and began forming another army. The Ottomans captured considerable parts of Moldovian territory but were unable to conquer some of the major Moldavian strongholds such as (Suceava, Neamţ, Hotin) and were constantly harassed by small-scale Moldavians attacks. Soon they were also confronted with starvation, a situation made worse by an outbreak of the plague. Meanwhile, anti-Ottoman forces were being assembled in TransylvaniaIstoria României, p.158 under Stephen V Báthory's command. Confronted with this army and with Ştefan's counterattack, the Ottomans retreated from major parts of Moldavia in August 1476 to come back again in 1480. In fiction In the Romanian theatrical play Apus de Soare by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea (set in the final year of Ştefan's reign), one can find a description of the battle in the form of a dialog between the daughters and widows of the boyars who had fallen in the battle, in which they describe how their respective fathers and husbands had to drag Ştefan out of the battle, as he desperately tried to keep fighting.

Jains increase their level of spiritual intensity often using fasting and prayer/meditation to help. The five main vows are emphasized during this time. There are no set rules, and followers are encouraged to practice according to their ability and desires. Normally, Digambaras refer it as Das Lakshana Dharma while Śvētāmbaras refer to it as Paryushana (\\"abiding\\" or \\"coming together\\"). The duration of Paryushana is for 8 days for Śvētāmbara Jains and 10 days for Jains belonging to the Digambara sect. The festival ends with the celebration of Samvatsari or Kshamavani (forgiveness day).  Meaning  Paryushana means \\"abiding and coming together\\". It is a time when the Jains take on vows of study and fasting.  Observances  Das Lakshana (Paryushana) celebrations, Jain Center of America, New York City The Digambara Jains recite the ten chapters of the sacred Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra on ten days of fasting. Digambaras celebrate Ananta Chaturdashi on which a special worship is done. Many towns have a procession leading to the main Jain temple. Ananta Chaturdashi marks the day when Lord Vasupujya attained Moksha (nirvana). At the conclusion of the festival, followers request forgiveness from others for any offenses committed during the last year. Forgiveness is asked by saying Micchami Dukkadam to others, which means, \\"If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or action, then I seek your forgiveness.\\" During the eight-day festival, the Śvētāmbara Murtipujakas recite the Kalpa Sūtra, which includes a recitation of the section on birth of Mahavira on the fifth day. Some Śvētāmbara Sthānakavāsīs recite the Antagada Sutra, which details the life of great men and women who attained moksha during the eras of Neminatha and Mahavira. = Fasting = During Paryushana, Jains observe a fast. The span of the fast can last from a day to 30 days or even more. In Digambara Jainism, śrāvakas (laypersons) do not take food and/or water (boiled) more than once in a day when observing fasts, while Śvētāmbaras observing a fast survive on boiled water which is consumed only between sunrise and sunset. = Requesting forgiveness = At the conclusion of the festival, śrāvakas request each other for forgiveness for all offenses committed during the last year. This occurs on the Paryusha day for Śvētāmbaras and on the Prathama (first day) of the month of Ashvin Krashna for Digambaras. Forgiveness is asked by saying Micchami Dukkadam or Uttam Kshama to each other. It means \\"If I have caused you offence in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness\\".  Dashlakshana Dharma  Das Lakshana (Paryushana) celebrations, Jain Center of America, New York City Das-Dharma (ten righteous virtues) are mentioned in the Jain text, Tattvartha Sutra. These are: # Uttam Kshama (forbearance) - उत्तम क्षमा # Uttam Mardava (supreme modesty) - उत्तम मार्दव # Uttam Aarjava (straightforwardness) - उत्तम आर्जव #Uttam Shoch (purity) - उत्तम शौच # Uttam Satya (truth) - उत्तम सत्य # Uttam Sanyam (supreme restraint) - उत्तम संयम # Uttam Tap (austerity) - उत्तम तप # Uttam Tyaga (renunciation) - उत्तम त्याग # Uttam Aakinchanya (non-attachment) and - उत्तम अकिंचन्य # Uttam Brahmcharya (supreme celibacy) - उत्तम बह्मचर्य In the full form, it is a 10-day vrata that comes every year. It may be undertaken during Shukla Panchami to Chaturdashi of Bhadrapada, Magh or Chaitra months. However it is common to do it during Bhadrapada. The Das-dharmas are all prefixed by the word ‘Uttam’ (Supreme) to signify that they are practiced at the highest level by the Jain monks. The householder practises them to a lesser extent. It lasts over a period of ten days, each day being dedicated to one of the ten Dharmas. In the sections below a) stands for the temporary point of view of modes and modification (vyavahar nay) b) stands for the permanent point of view of underlying substance (nīshyānay). = Forgiveness (Uttam Kshama) : उत्तम क्षमा = a) We forgive those who have wronged us and seek forgiveness from those we have wronged. Forgiveness is sought not just from human colleagues, but from all living beings ranging from one sensed to five sensed. If we do not forgive or seek forgiveness but instead harbor resentment, we bring misery and unhappiness on ourselves and in the process shatter our peace of mind and make enemies. Forgiving and seeking forgiveness oils the wheel of life allowing us to live in harmony with our fellow beings. It also attracts meritorious karma. b) Forgiveness here is directed to oneself. The soul, in a state of mistaken identity or false belief, assumes that it consists of the body, the karmas and the emotions – likes, dislikes, anger, pride etc. As a result of this incorrect belief, it inflicts pain upon itself and is thus the cause of its own misery. Nischay Kshama Dharma teaches the soul to correctly identify itself by encouraging it to contemplate in its true nature and hence achieve the state of right Belief (Samyak Darshan). It is only by achieving Samyak Darshan that the soul ceases to inflict pain on itself and attains supreme happiness. = Modesty/Humility (Uttam Maardav) : उत्तम मार्दव = a) Wealth, good looks, reputable family or intelligence often lead to pride. Pride means to believe one to be superior to others and to look down on others. By being proud you are measuring your worth by temporary material objects. These objects will either leave you or you will be forced to leave them when you die. These eventualities will cause you unhappiness as a result of the ‘dent’ caused to your self-worth. Being humble will prevent this. Pride also leads to the influx of the bad karmas. b) All the souls are equal, none being superior or inferior to another. The Nischay view encourages one to understand their true nature. All souls have the potential to be liberated souls. The only difference between the liberated souls and those in bondage is that the former have attained liberation as a result of their ‘effort’. With effort, even the latter can achieve liberation. = Straightforwardness (Uttam Aarjav) : उत्तम आर्जव = a) The action of a deceitful person is to think one thing, speak something else and do something entirely different. There is no harmony in their thought, speech and actions. Such a person loses credibility very quickly and lives in constant anxiety and fear of their deception being exposed. Being straightforward or honest, oils the wheel of life. You will be seen to be reliable and trustworthy. Deceitful actions lead to the influx of karmas. b) Delusion about one's identity is the root cause of unhappiness. The soul is made up of countless qualities like knowledge, happiness, effort, faith, and conduct. It has the potential to achieve omniscience (Kevala Gyana केवल ज्ञान) and reach a state of supreme bliss. Again, the body, the karmas, the thoughts and all the emotions are separate from the true nature of the soul. Only by practicing Nischay Arjav Dharma will one taste the true happiness that comes from within. = Truth (Uttam Satya) : उत्तम सत्य = a) If talking is not required, then do not talk. If it is required then only use the minimum of words, and all must all be absolutely true. Talking disturbs the stillness of the mind. Consider the person who lies and lives in fear of being exposed. To support one lie they have to utter a hundred more. They become caught up in a tangled web of lies and is seen as untrustworthy and unreliable. Lying leads to an influx of karma. b) Satya comes from the word Sat, whose one of the meaning is \\"existence\\". Existence is a quality of the soul. Recognising the soul's true nature as it really exists and taking shelter in the soul is practising Nischay Satya Dharma. = Contentment/Purity (Uttam Shoch) : उत्तम शौच = Contentment or happiness, derived from material objects, is only perceived to be so by a soul in a state of false belief. The fact is that material objects do not have a quality of happiness and therefore happiness cannot be obtained from them. The perception of ‘enjoying’ material objects is only a perception. This perception rewards the soul with only misery and nothing else. Real happiness comes from within, as it is the soul that possesses the quality of happiness. In order to dwell in pure soul (शुध्द आत्मा) and enjoy the bliss, the accumulated filth of karma (material attachments, jealousy, anger, lust, greed, Physical pleasures etc.) ought to be cleaned up. The process of cleaning up is called the Purity Dharma (शौच धर्म). With this understanding we free our soul of any karmic impurities, and false beliefs. = Self-Restraint (Uttam Sanyam) : उत्तम संयम = a) Temporary (Vyavahara nay) 1\\\\. Restraining from injury to life – Jains go to great lengths, compared to other world religions, to protect life. This encompasses all living beings, from one-sensed onwards. The purpose of not eating root vegetables is that they contain countless one-sensed beings termed ‘nigod’. During Paryushana the Jains also do not eat green vegetables to reduce harm to the lower sensed beings. 2\\\\. Self-restraint from desires or passions – These lead to pain and are therefore to be avoided. b) Permanent (nīshyānay) 1\\\\. Restraining injury to the self – This has been elaborated upon in Nischay Kshma Dharma. 2\\\\. Self-restraint from desires or passions – Emotions, e.g. likes, dislikes or anger lead to misery and need to be eradicated. They are not part of the true nature of the soul and only arise when the soul is in a state of false belief. The only method to free oneself from these is to contemplate on the true nature of the soul and in the process commence the journey to liberation or moksha. = Penance (Uttam Tap) : उत्तम तप = a) This does not only mean fasting but also includes a reduced diet, restriction of certain types of foods, avoiding tasty foods, etc. The purpose of penance is to keep desires and passions in control. Over-indulgence inevitably leads to misery. Penance leads to an influx of meritorious karmas. b) Meditation prevents the rise of desires and passions in the soul. In a deep state of meditation the desire to intake food does not arise. The first Tirthankara, Rishabha is said to have meditative in such a state for six months, during which he observed Nischay Uttam Tap. = Renunciation (Uttam Tyaag) : उत्तम त्याग = a) Renouncing worldly possessions leads to a life of contentment and assists in keeping desires in check. Controlling desires not only leads to an influx of meritorious karma, but also absolving oneself from bad karma. Renunciation is done at the highest level by Jain ascetics who renounce not only the household but also their clothes. A person's strength is measured not by the amount of wealth they accumulate but by the amount of wealth they renounce. b) Renouncing the emotions, the root cause of misery, is supreme renunciation, which is only possible by contemplating on the true nature of the soul. = Non-attachment (Uttam Akinchanya) : उत्तम अकिंचन्य = a) This assists the person in detaching from external possessions. Historically ten possessions are listed in Jain scriptures: ‘land, house, silver, gold, wealth, grain, female servants, male servants, garments and utensils’. Being unattached from these, helps control our desires and leads to an influx of meritorious karmas. b) This assists us in being unattached from our internal attachments: false belief, anger, pride, deceit, greed, laughter, liking, disliking, lamentation, fear, disgust, sexual desires. Ridding the soul of these leads to its purification. = Supreme Celibacy (Uttam Brahmacharya) : उत्तम बह्मचर्य = a) This means refraining from all pleasures associated with the sense of touch, e.g. a cool breeze on a hot summer day or using a cushion for a hard surface. The monks practice this to the highest degree with all their body, speech and mind. b) Brahmacharya is derived from the word Brahma – Soul and Charya – to dwell. Nischay Brahmacharya means to dwell in your soul. Only by residing in the soul are you the master of the Universe. Residing outside your soul makes you a slave to desires.  Date  The date for the Paryushana festival is Bhadra shukla chaturthi. For this minimum duration, Paryushana must be initiated by panchami (the fifth day) of the shukla paksha phase of Bhadra. The last day is called Samvatsari, short for Samvatsari Pratikramana. Because of computational and other differences, there can be some minor differences among various sects. It comes at the time when the wandering monks take up temporary residence for the monsoon period or \\"cāturmāsa\\" \\"four-month\\". Because at this time the monks have settled in the town for a longer duration, it is time for the householders to have an annual renewal of the faith by listening to the statement of the Dharma and by meditation and vratas (self-control). Digambara Jains starting a 10-day period from Bhadra shukla panchami, during which the dashalakshana vrata is undertaken. Śvētāmbara celebrate an eight-day festival that ends with Bhadrapada shukla chaturthi. It is believed that the devas (heavenly beings) do an eight-part puja (worship) of the tirthankaras, which takes eight days. Śvētāmbara Jains celebrate this period as Paryushana.  Closure  In some Indian States, slaughter houses are kept closed for 1–8 days during the Paryushana festival. It is done in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, that have large population of the Jain community. On 14 March 2008, The Supreme Court of India held that the ban on slaughter houses in Ahmedabad during Paryushan festival is legal. The court noted:  See also  * Mahavir Janma Kalyanak * Ratnatraya * God in Jainism * Jain cosmology * Sallekhana * Jain festival  References  = Citations = = Sources =  *  External links  * Paryuṣaṇ on JAINpedia * Daśa-lakṣaṇa-parvan on JAINpedia * Paryushan Pravachan by Jain Muni Rashtrasant Pujya Namramuni MS.

Structure  The common carotid arteries are present on the left and right sides of the body. These arteries originate from different arteries but follow symmetrical courses. The right common carotid originates in the neck from the brachiocephalic trunk; the left from the aortic arch in the thorax. These split into the external and internal carotid arteries at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, at around the level of the fourth cervical vertebra. The left common carotid artery can be thought of as having two parts: a thoracic (chest) part and a cervical (neck) part. The right common carotid originates in or close to the neck and contains only a small thoracic portion. There are studies in the bioengineering literature that have looked into characterizing the geometric structure of the common carotid artery from both qualitative and mathematical (quantitative) standpoints. The average diameters of the common carotids in adult males and females are 6.5 mm and 6.1 mm respectively. =In the chest= Only the left common carotid artery has a substantial presence in the thorax. It originates directly from the aortic arch, and travels upward through the superior mediastinum to the level of the left sternoclavicular joint. During the thoracic part of its course, the left common carotid artery is related to the following structures: In front, it is separated from the manubrium of the sternum by the sternohyoid and sternothyroid muscles, the anterior portions of the left pleura and lung, the left brachiocephalic vein, and the remains of the thymus; behind, it lies on the trachea, esophagus, left recurrent laryngeal nerve, and thoracic duct. To its right side below is the brachiocephalic trunk, and above, the trachea, the inferior thyroid veins, and the remains of the thymus; to its left side are the left vagus and phrenic nerves, left pleura, and lung. The left subclavian artery is posterior and slightly lateral to it. =In the neck= Arteries of the neck. The right common carotid artery – labeled Common caroti in the figure – divides into the right internal carotid artery and external carotid artery. The cervical portions of the common carotids resemble each other so closely that one description will apply to both. Each vessel passes obliquely upward, from behind the sternoclavicular joint to the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage, where it divides. At the lower neck the two common carotid arteries are separated from each other by a very narrow interval which contains the trachea; but at the upper part, the thyroid gland, the larynx and pharynx separate the two arteries. The common carotid artery is contained in a sheath known as the carotid sheath, which is derived from the deep cervical fascia and encloses also the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve, the vein lying lateral to the artery, and the nerve between the artery and vein, on a plane posterior to both. On opening the sheath, each of these three structures is seen to have a separate fibrous cover. At approximately the level of the fourth cervical vertebra, the common carotid artery splits (\\"bifurcates\\" in literature) into an internal carotid artery (ICA) and an external carotid artery (ECA). While both branches travel upward, the internal carotid takes a deeper (more internal) path, eventually travelling up into the skull to supply the brain. The external carotid artery travels more closely to the surface, and sends off numerous branches that supply the neck and face. Superficial dissection of the right side of the neck, showing the carotid and subclavian arteries At the lower part of the neck the common carotid artery is very deeply seated, being covered by the integument, superficial fascia, the platysma muscle, deep cervical fascia, the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and the omohyoid; in the upper part of its course it is more superficial, being covered merely by the integument, the superficial fascia, the platysma, deep cervical fascia, and medial margin of the sternocleidomastoid. When the sternocleidomastoid muscle is drawn backward, the artery is seen to be contained in a triangular space known as the carotid triangle. This space is bounded behind by the sternocleidomastoid, above by the stylohyoid and the posterior belly of the digastric muscle, and below by the superior belly of the omohyoid. This part of the artery is crossed obliquely, from its medial to its lateral side, by the sternocleidomastoid branch of the superior thyroid artery; it is also crossed by the superior and middle thyroid veins (which end in the internal jugular vein); descending in front of its sheath is the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve, this filament being joined by one or two branches from the cervical nerves, which cross the vessel obliquely. Sometimes the descending branch of the hypoglossal nerve is contained within the sheath. The superior thyroid vein crosses the artery near its termination, and the middle thyroid vein a little below the level of the cricoid cartilage; the anterior jugular vein crosses the artery just above the clavicle, but is separated from it by the sternohyoid and sternothyroid. Behind, the artery is separated from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae by the longus colli and longus capitis muscles, the sympathetic trunk being interposed between it and the muscles. The inferior thyroid artery crosses behind the lower part of the vessel. Medially, it is in relation with the esophagus, trachea, and thyroid gland (which overlaps it), the inferior thyroid artery and recurrent laryngeal nerve being interposed; higher up, with the larynx and pharynx. Lateral to the artery, inside the carotid sheath with the common carotid, are the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve. At the lower part of the neck, on the right side of the body, the right recurrent laryngeal nerve crosses obliquely behind the artery; the right internal jugular vein diverges from the artery. On the left side, however, the left internal jugular vein approaches and often overlaps the lower part of the artery. Behind the angle of bifurcation of the common carotid artery is a reddish-brown oval body known as the carotid body. It is similar in structure to the coccygeal body which is situated on the median sacral artery. The relations of the cervical region of the common carotid artery may be discussed in two points: *Internal relations of organs present inside the carotid sheath *two external relations of carotid sheath  Collateral circulation  The chief communications outside the skull take place between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries, and the deep cervical artery and the descending branch of the occipital artery; the vertebral artery takes the place of the internal carotid artery within the cranium.  Variation  = Origin = The right common carotid may rise above the level of the upper border of the sternoclavicular joint; this variation occurs in about 12 percent of cases. In other cases, the artery on the right side may arise as a separate branch from the arch of the aorta, or in conjunction with the left carotid. The left common carotid varies in its origin more than the right. In the majority of abnormal cases it arises with the brachiocephalic trunk; if that artery is absent, the two carotids arise usually by a single trunk. It is rarely joined with the left subclavian artery, except in cases of transposition of the aortic arch. = Point of division = In the majority of abnormal cases, the bifurcation occurs higher than usual, the artery dividing opposite or even above the hyoid bone; more rarely, it occurs below, opposite the middle of the larynx, or the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. In at least one reported case, the artery was only 4 cm in length and divided at the root of the neck. Very rarely, the common carotid artery ascends in the neck without any subdivision, either the external or the internal carotid being absent; and in a few cases the common carotid has itself been found to be absent, the external and internal carotids arising directly from the arch of the aorta. This peculiarity existed on both sides in some instances, on one side in others. = Occasional branches = The common carotid usually gives off no branch previous to its bifurcation, but it occasionally gives origin to the superior thyroid artery or its laryngeal branch, the ascending pharyngeal artery, the inferior thyroid artery, or, more rarely, the vertebral artery.  Clinical significance  The common carotid artery is often used in measuring the pulse, especially in patients who are in shock and who lack a detectable pulse in the more peripheral arteries of the body. The pulse is taken by palpating the artery just deep to the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the level of the superior border of the thyroid cartilage. Presence of a carotid pulse has been estimated to indicate a systolic blood pressure of more than 40 mmHg, as given by the 50% percentile. Carotidynia is a syndrome marked by soreness of the carotid artery near the bifurcation. Carotid stenosis may occur in patients with atherosclerosis. The intima-media thickness of the carotid artery wall is a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis, it increases with age and with long-term exposure to particulate air pollution.

It features the Seventh Doctor and Ace. Plot The Seventh Doctor and Ace arrive on Heritage in the year 6048 to visit the Heyworths, who are old friends of the Doctor's. Nobody seems to want them on the planet, and certainly not poking their noses in. But they are stuck there until the next day. The Doctor doesn't want to get involved, but Ace can't help herself: by talking to Lee Marks she finds out that the Heyworths were murdered by the townsfolk, because they threatened to disrupt Professor Wakeling's experiments into cloning. Without the cloning technology, Heritage would have nothing going for it at all. The Doctor suspects all this, and also that the Heyworth's surviving daughter Sweetness is a clone of her mother created by Professor Wakeling. What he doesn't tell Ace is that Sweetness's mother is his old companion Melanie Bush. The Doctor confronts Wakeling and ruins his chances of announcing his discoveries to the universe. As Wakeling tries to take revenge on the Doctor, he is caught in a landslide and probably killed. Continuity * The story forms part of an ongoing story arc planned by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry, involving the apparent death of Ace. The other books in the arc are Prime Time and Loving the Alien. This in turn feeds into a larger arc involving the apparent deaths of many of the Doctor's companions running through the Past Doctor Adventures and the Eighth Doctor Adventures. * Following the events of Justin Richards's novel Sometime Never..., it is uncertain whether or not the events of Heritage take place as described, or whether Mel Bush is still alive. Dale Smith has stated that the novel contains a \\"get-out\\" clause for allowing Mel to still be alive. * Although the novel's chapters provide specific dates for all of the action, the later novel Halflife retcons the action to take place several centuries earlier in an attempt to make the lack of stable cloning technology more acceptable. However, the author has pointed out that the novels states that Wakeling was not the first person to develop cloning technology, and that the era was chosen to tie in with the Doctor Who television serial The Invisible Enemy.

It was one of the UK's last independent investment banks and one of the last to remain a private partnership. The main parts of the business were acquired by JPMorgan Chase in 2009 with the remains being sold to other financial institutions. The Partnership was well known for its 'blue- blooded' reputation and its complete aversion to publicity. It was one of the most successful brokers and corporate advisers in London, being described by the Financial Times as 'dominant' and as having an 'aura'. History The company has its roots in the early Huguenot financiers who left France for Geneva in 1685 after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which established Catholicism as the state religion of France. Among those were members of the Cazenove family, who later left Geneva for the UK seeking wealth and freedom in the City of London. In 1819 Philip Cazenove first joined the business of his brother-in-law John Francis Menet (John Menet had married Philip Cazenove's sister Louisa in 1805). Cazenove and Menet become partners, and in 1823 the firm of Cazenove started. After Menet died, Cazenove entered into a partnership with Joseph Laurence and Charles Pearce. In 1854 Cazenove branched out on his own, and later he formed a new partnership with his son and nephew. The stockbroker firm continued to develop and by the 1930s had become one of the leading stockbroking partnerships in London. The company played a major part as advisor in most of Margaret Thatcher's UK Government's privatisation issues in the 1980s. =Change of corporate structure= In 2000, Cazenove & Co announced its intention to dissolve the partnership, incorporate, and then float on the London Stock Exchange. The company duly incorporated and raised funds from institutional investors, However the company's ambition to list publicly was hampered by poor market conditions in the UK in 2001 and 2002. The post float period did see the company open offices in Frankfurt, Paris and Beijing as well as restructuring its fund management business. =Merger with JPMorgan Chase= In November 2004, Cazenove and JPMorgan Chase announced an agreement that JP Morgan would buy a 50% stake in Cazenove and merge their UK investment banking operations, with an option to buy the remaining 50% stake within five years.

Willie B. (C. 1959 - February 2, 2000) was a western lowland gorilla who lived at the Zoo of Atlanta for 39 years, from 1961 until his death on February 2, 2000. He was named after the former mayor of Atlanta, William Berry Hartsfield. Willie B. was kept in isolation for 27 years with only a television and a tire swing to keep him company. In 1988, he was moved to an outside exhibit and allowed to socialize and raise a family. He then embraced his role as silverback and leader of a troop. Willie B. was the second Gorilla known by that name at the Atlanta Zoo. The previous Willie B. died at the age of 3 shortly before the better-known successor was purchased. Both Willie B's had been purchased from international gorilla hunter Dr. Deets Pickett of Kansas City. The second Willie B. cost $5,500 to obtain for the zoo. Willie B. fathered five offspring at Zoo Atlanta: Kudzoo, Olympia, Sukari, Kidogo, and Lulu. Kidogo, the only male offspring, took on the name Willie B., Jr. after his father died, taking his place as the heir. When he died at the age of 41, he was the oldest gorilla in the United States to have fathered offspring. More than 8,000 people attended the memorial ceremony held in his honor, and the zoo now has a life-size bronze statue of him on permanent display outside the Gorilla exhibit. His remains were cremated and 80 percent of his remains were kept in a bronze box in the bronze statue at Zoo Atlanta and the other 20 percent were flown back to the African jungle. The Atlanta Silverbacks soccer team was named in his honor.

He joined the British Union of Fascists in 1933 and remained a follower of Oswald Mosley for the rest of his life; he was considered to be the party's chief ideologue. He has been described as the \\"Alfred Rosenberg of British fascism\\".R. Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, London: Allan Lane, 1969, p. 117 Early life Born in Edinburgh, Thomson came from a family long prominent in Scottish public life, and was the grandson of the architect Alexander Thomson.Gavin Bowd, Fascist Scotland: Caledonia and the Far Right, Birlinn, 2013 p. 38 Thomson was educated in universities in his homeland, the United States and briefly Heidelberg University in Germany, studying mechanical engineering, science and philosophy.Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, p. 117 In 1926 he became a partner in an engineering firm in London specialising in the manufacture of silver paper, a process he had learned in Germany.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 252 Whilst studying in Germany, Thomson met and married Lisbeth, the daughter of x-ray pioneer Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen.S. Dorril, Blackshirt – Sir Oswald Mosley and British Fascism, London: Penguin, 2007, p. 252 They would go on to have three children together; Lisbeth already had a daughter from a previous relationship, while Thomson also had a long- term mistress, Olive Burdett.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, pp. 210–211 Thomson's political career began with his joining the Communist Party of Great Britain, although his membership did not last long as he rejected notions of historical materialism and moved more towards corporatism. Thomson became a leading authority on the works of Oswald Spengler and in 1932 published the book Civilization as Divine Superman: A Superorganic Philosophy of History, which rejected Spengler's theories about the decline of civilisation, arguing that it could be avoided by the rejection of capitalism and its replacement with collectivism. In this conviction he was influenced by Maurice Maeterlinck, who had written of \\"insect communities\\" in which a communal spirit was shared by all members of a \\"hive\\".Robert Skidelsky, Oswald Mosley, Macmillan, 1981, p. 345 The book also marked his drift towards a fascistic outlook.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, p. 39 British Union of Fascists He joined the British Union of Fascists in 1933 and soon rose to the post of Director of Policy, from where he became the leading ideological light in the party and a close associate of Oswald Mosley and Neil Francis Hawkins. Whilst in this position he produced his seminal work The Corporate State (March 1935, republished as The Coming Corporate State in January 1937), in which he set out the vision of a BUF government in Britain. Thomson envisaged the formation of twenty corporations, each controlling a specific sector of the economy. These corporations would be further divided up to cover each individual industry and would also feed into a National Corporation, which would effectively form the government. Corporations would have equal representation for employers, workers and consumers, with elections to the corporations taking the place of existing political activity.Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, pp. 143–150 In 1935 he was sent to his native Scotland on a speaking tour designed to present the fascist message although most of his engagements were disrupted by Communist hecklers, including one at Aberdeen where an extended chorus of The Internationale from the crowd effectively silenced the BUF speakers.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, p. 45 Thomson became a leading figure in the BUF and in 1937 he represented the party in Municipal elections in Bethnal Green (SW), winning 23.17% of the votes and finishing ahead of the Liberal candidates.Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, pp. 279–282 Although he was not elected, the result marked a good total for the BUF. His status in the party now assured, Thomson became editor of the party weekly, Action, in 1939.Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, p. 119 An important figure in the BUF, he served for a time as Mosley's representative to Germany, a role in which he was closely watched by MI5.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 317 He shared with the Nazis a strong anti-SemitismDorril, Blackshirt, p. 410 and was generally noted as an admirer of Nazi Germany.Richard Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, Oxford University Press, 1983, p. 55 He was part of BUF delegation that attended the 1933 Nuremberg Rally.Griffiths, Fellow Travellers on the Right, p. 172 In all he made five extended trips to Nazi Germany.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, p. 209 Despite all of this as one of the public faces of the BUF he had actually been interviewed by The Jewish Chronicle in 1934 and had told that newspaper that the group had no specific enmity towards the Jews.Skidelsky, Oswald Mosley, p. 385 Thomson also had loose connections to hard-line Revisionist Zionism activist Wolfgang von Weisl although these were curtailed when von Weisl's leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky told him to break off relations.Stein Ugelvik Larsen, Fascism Outside Europe, Columbia University Press, 2001, p. 379 Mosley admired Thomson for his intellectDorril, Blackshirt, p. 280 and would later describe him as an \\"honest man and devoted patriot\\",O. Mosley, My Life, London: Nelson, 1970, p. 332 although he was also known to privately criticise Thomson as something of a 'yes-man'.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 260 In 1937 Thomson wrote that the British left had enforced \\"specifically Anglo-Saxon democratic methods of parliamentary governance\\" upon Ireland to whom it was \\"entirely foreign and distasteful.\\" Thomson also believed that a United Ireland would occur under fascism, an ideology which was less foreign to the \\"native Celtic culture\\". Following the outbreak of war Thomson devised a plan to attack the Nordic League as 'Nazi traitors' in the hope of establishing the BUF's patriotic credentials, although it came to nothing and actually ran alongside attempts by Francis Hawkins to establish BUF control over the League.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 493 Along with most of the leading members of the BUF, Thomson was detained under Defence Regulation 18B in May 1940 and interned for much of the Second World War.Benewick, Political Violence and Public Order, p. 294 He spent his entire jail spell in Brixton Prison, rather than the generally more favourable prison camp on the Isle of Man, until his release in 1944.Biography at Friends of Oswald Mosley site (Archived version) Thomson reacted badly to his spell in detention and suffered a nervous breakdown whilst incarcerated.G. Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, New York: IB Tauris, 2007, p. 21 He was released, having been moved to a camp on the Isle of Man, in September 1944.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, p. 212 Union Movement Following his release Thomson set up a number of book clubs across Britain to ensure the continuing spread of Mosley's ideas. The book clubs served as planning meetings for the future of Mosleyite politics after the war.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 554 He also led the Union of British Freemen, a group he set up with fellow ex-BUF member Victor Burgess in 1944 as an attempt to bring together former BUF members.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 39 After the war Thomson travelled regularly to Ireland to meet with Mosley and discuss political development.Dorril, Blackshirt, p. 553 Eager to expand the base of operations of fascism in Britain he also sought unsuccessfully to forge alliances with the proto-environmentalist Rural Reconstruction Association through leading member Jorian Jenks, a former BUF activist, as well as individuals on the fringes of Welsh nationalism.Dorril, Blackshirt, pp. 585–6 He joined the Union Movement on its foundation in 1948 and became a leading figure in the new party as both general secretary and the editor of the UM newspaper Union. Playing a leading role in the development of the ideology of the UM, Thomson initially supported Europe a Nation enthusiastically, but soon tired of the esoteric policy and in 1950 organised a brief, and even more unsuccessful, return to pre-war policy.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, pp. 54–5 After this he came to advocate a \\"left-wing fascist\\" approach, arguing that the UM should target the working class for support with anti-capitalism rhetoric.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 63 As well as his important position within the UM domestically, Thomson was also a central figure in the party's international links. Thomson was sent to Spain in 1949 to try to build up support for Mosley in the country, although the trip was somewhat unsuccessful as he failed to impress the falangists and had to contend with the negative words of former BUF member Angus Macnab, who had grown to loathe Mosley.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 99 later Thomson was central in liaising with the New European Order, a group Mosley had no official contact with due to his support for the European Social Movement.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 110 His international reputation grew further in 1952 when he was appointed to the editorial board of the prestigious Nation Europa magazine.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 111 He also became known as the publisher of Frederick J. Veale's Advance to Barbarism, one of the early pieces of Second World War Historical revisionism.Macklin, Very Deeply Dyed in Black, p. 129 He also contributed to The European, a magazine edited by Diana Mosley. Thomson continued to serve as leading UM figure until his death in 1955 from cancer. Thomson, who had lived most of his life in the East End of London, had his funeral service at St Columba's Church, Shoreditch before being cremated.Bowd, Fascist Scotland, p. 248 References Category:1899 births Category:1955 deaths Category:British Union of Fascists politicians Category:Deaths from cancer Category:People detained under Defence Regulation 18B Category:People from Edinburgh Category:Heidelberg University alumni Category:Scottish fascists Category:Scottish mechanical engineers Category:Scottish newspaper editors Category:Scottish philosophers Category:Scottish political philosophers Category:Scottish politicians Category:20th-century philosophers ","title":"Alexander Raven Thomson"},{"id":"2591906","text":"Giuliana Sgrena The Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena was a covert operation by the Italian military secret service, SISMI, to rescue Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena from kidnappers in Iraq. After the successful retrieval of Sgrena, on 4 March 2005, the car with her and two secret agents came under friendly fire by US Army troops along the Baghdad airport road; secret agent Nicola Calipari was killed by US Army Specialist Mario Lozano. The incident created tension between the two countries, and arguably increased the Italian public's hostility towards the United States of America.  Background  Giuliana Sgrena had been kidnapped a month earlier, on 4 February, while working as a non-embedded journalist in Iraq for the Italian communist newspaper Il Manifesto. Some have argued she was overconfident because she thought kidnappers would only target pro-American journalists, but others counter she was fully aware of the risks.  Rescue and incident  = Sgrena's rescue = Sgrena was rescued in circumstances yet unclear by Italian secret-service agents from SISMI the Italian Military Intelligence service, on 4 March 2005. One of the agents was Nicola Calipari, the other was Andrea Carpani. One unconfirmed allegation is that the Italian government paid a ransom in the range of millions of US dollars. The agents and Sgrena left by car, heading for Baghdad International Airport. The route from downtown Baghdad to the airport has been widely described as the most dangerous road in Iraq. = The shooting of the car = At around 20:55, the car Sgrena was riding in was fired upon by U.S. troops while on the way to the airport. Nicola Calipari, who had negotiated her release, was killed while allegedly protecting Giuliana Sgrena with his body. Giuliana Sgrena was hit in the shoulder. Autopsies of Calipari's body allegedly showed that he was struck by a single bullet in the temple. Sgrena and Carpani were wounded. Sgrena was treated by US Army medics on the scene and medivaced to a US Army field hospital shortly after the incident. US Army medics also treated the injured officer on the scene, but he refused a medical evacuation for further assistance. Sgrena underwent surgery to extract shrapnel from her shoulder. The US military did not disclose their whereabouts later. Sgrena arrived in Rome a day after the fatal incident.  Reactions  The incident prompted criticism from Italian government officials: *The Italian Prime Minister at the time, Silvio Berlusconi, said: \\"I believe we must have an explanation for such a serious incident, for which someone must take the responsibility.\\" He has long been a close ally of George W. Bush. Having summoned the US ambassador to Italy, he declared \\"It is a pity. This was a joyful moment which made all our compatriots happy, which has been transformed into profound pain by the death of a person who behaved so bravely.\\" *Roberto Calderoli, the Italian Minister of Reforms, stated that several incidents had already occurred in the liberation of Giuliana Sgrena, the shooting being only the last of them. *Mirko Tremaglia, Italian undersecretary for Foreign Affairs, said to the Italian press agency ANSA that \\"The Americans must be firmly reminded to respect human and civil rules.\\" *Gianni Alemanno, the minister of Agriculture, said that \\"We want the culprits to be punished, and we demand an explanation from the Americans.\\" He added \\"We are faithful allies, but we must not let anyone think that we are subordinates.\\" *Carlo Giovanardi, Minister for the Relations with the Parliament, said that he did not believe one word of the version presented by the US Army. In response, White House press secretary Scott McClellan offered condolences stating that \\"we regret the loss of life\\" and added that \\"details are still unclear\\", and that an investigation would be conducted. Leading figures of the Italian left-wing opposition renewed criticism of Italy's participation in the occupation of Iraq, also with support from some members of the right-wing ruling coalition: *Romano Prodi, future Prime Minister and at the time leader of Italy's opposition coalition, stated \\"57 millions Italians united in waiting for Giuliana Sgrena's liberation have a right to know what happened.\\" *Fausto Bertinotti, leader of the Communist Refoundation Party, said that \\"After the extremely grave fact of Nicola Calipari's death, pulling [Italian] troops out of Iraq is an act of public sanity.\\" *Piero Fassino, leader of the Democrats of the Left, said that \\"It's not fate that pulls the trigger of a machine gun.\\" *Raffaele Costa, member of Parliament in Forza Italia, said on 6 March that the Parliament, due to debate an extension to the mission on 14 March, should set a clear date for withdrawal. Tens of thousands of Italian citizens paid their respects to Calipari before the state funeral on March 8, 2005, at Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome. The resulting strain on the political relationship between Italy and the United States is the most significant since the Cavalese cable car disaster of 1998. The case, which saw a hostage being released unharmed by Iraqi kidnappers and almost killed by American troops, strengthened the already widespread opposition to the presence of Italian troops in Iraq.  Accounts of the incident  Due to the conditions in which the facts unraveled, and due to a mutually suspicious attitude of some of the involved parties, widely different accounts of the incident have been proposed. = Speculations on assassination attempt = On 6 March, Sgrena claimed that she might have been deliberately targeted, a consequence of the United States' disapproval of the means of her liberation. \\"The fact is that they do everything to prevent the adoption of this practice to save the lives of people held hostages, everybody knows that. So I do not see why I should rule out that I could have been the target\\", she told Sky TG24. The White House responded to this, denying that US troops would specifically target civilians, and stating that the zone is \\"a dangerous road, and it is a combat zone that our coalition forces are in. Often, they have to make split-second decisions to protect their own security\\". Pier Scolari said \\"I hope the Italian government does something because either this was an ambush, as I think, or we are dealing with imbeciles or terrorized kids who shoot at anyone\\". = American version = John Negroponte, then US ambassador in Iraq. His car convoy was the reason for the placement of blocking point 541. According to initial statements from a senior U.S. military official, the car was traveling at speeds of more than 150 km/h (about 100 mph). He said that troops manning the checkpoint also claimed that car almost lost control several times before the shooting as the car hydroplaned through large puddles. In the first few days following the incident, US spokesmen said that the Italian vehicle had been fired upon when it approached U.S. Checkpoint 504 (Camp Victory) at excessive speed, and did not slow down or stop after US troops used hand gestures, flashing lights and fired warning shots. The U.S. troops were then allegedly forced to disable the vehicle by firing into the engine block. Checkpoint 504 is a permanent roadblock. Within the first week after the incident the version of events acknowledged by US spokesmen was significantly modified. In the second version of events, extra security patrols had recently been added to the airport route because a \\"senior diplomatic VIP\\" was going to use the road that evening; the shooting occurred at a temporary \\"blocking position\\" (not a \\"checkpoint\\"). The \\"senior diplomatic VIP\\" was later acknowledged to have been Ambassador John Negroponte, who was unable to have used helicopter transport due to bad weather. = Italian version = The then Italian minister of foreign affairs, Gianfranco Fini This version of the events contrasts markedly with a version subsequently referred to the Italian Parliament by the minister of foreign affairs Gianfranco Fini. Speaking in the Camera dei Deputati on 8 March 2005, Fini stated that there had been no roadblock, that no warning was given, that the car \\"was not over 40 km/h, and was illuminated from inside to facilitate control and allow phone calls to be made\\", that \\"[w]hen a strong source of light, like a projector, was turned on a few tens of meters from the car, it slowed down until it was almost stopped, and the shooting began\\", and that Calipari, described as one of Italy's most experienced intelligence agents with a history of successful operations in Iraq, not only had previously made \\"all necessary contacts\\" with US authorities in Baghdad and had obtained all the necessary clearances, but had also spoken to US and Italian authorities from his mobile phone just minutes before the attack. Fini asserted that photographs taken of the car established that it was not shot at from the front (or into the engine block), as one would expect if it were approaching a checkpoint, but rather that it was shot at from the right side, with the bullets entering through that side. Fini's version of the events was also based on the testimony of a second Italian intelligence agent, who was driving the car. He also said that the theory of a deliberate attack against Sgrena was \\"totally unfounded;\\" he finally repeated his wish that Calipari's death would not induce \\"unnecessary anti-US feelings\\" in the Italian public opinion. = American rebuttal = General George Casey, commander of US forces in Iraq. The Italian version in contrast with the statements of General George Casey, commander of US forces in Iraq, who said that the Italian government had not given the US advance warning about the convoy carrying Ms Sgrena. \\"I personally do not have any indication of that, even on a preliminary basis\\", General Casey said. General George Casey's statements are backed by General Mario Marioli, Italy's top military commander in Iraq. Marioli informed US officials that Calipari and the other Italian officer were there, but gave no information about the specifics of Calipari's operation. However, the Italian investigators' report, released 2 May 2005, claims that the American authorities were informed that Calipari was due to return to the Baghdad airport with a hostage on the night of the shooting. Giuliana Sgrena's version of the events also only mentions the contact between Calipari and the Italian authorities, but says nothing about any contact with the American authorities whilst she was with him. US forces confiscated cell and satellite phones from the car's occupants in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, and according to the US Army's official report, gave them back before the Italians were taken from the scene. The official report also notes that the \\"both HMMWVs involved in the blocking position were moved to transport Ms Sgrena to the Combat Support Hospital in the International Zone. Further, the scene was not deemed to be a crime scene, and efforts were made to clear the roadway.\\" The report further concluded that the vehicle was shot while it was traveling towards the road block, not from a point perpendicular to the road, as Gianfranco Fini has insisted.  Military reports  Approximate map of the incident, according to information the US and Italian reports agree upon. Two military reports were produced, one by the US Army and one by the Italian government. = Release of classified information in US report = The Multinational Force In Iraq released an official report that was posted on its website. Classified information (such as the name of the other Sismi agent, the names of the soldiers involved, and coalition troop movements) in the report was redacted but the report was accidentally published in a form that allowed the redacted information to be easily retrieved. The report was published in the PDF file format, and the classified sentences were covered by a black bar. However, the text below it had not been erased, and was present in the file. A copy-and-paste from the PDF reader to a word processor was sufficient to make the lines reappear. The possibility of reading the complete report was quickly discovered by a Greek exchange student in Bologna, who preferred to maintain anonymous, and by Gianluca Neri, who posted the versions on his blog, Macchianera. There has been some argument about who was first out, but as Neri himself wrote, it was such a simple task that more people could well have noticed in a short time independently of each other. = Content of the US report = The US report cleared the soldiers of the 69th Infantry of any wrongdoing, claiming the unit followed proper procedures and defending the decision by one soldier, Spc. Mario Lozano, to open fire after flashing a light and firing warning shots. The report indicated that the soldiers had already turned away about 15-30 cars before the incident, and were alert because of two warnings (BOLOs, Be On LookOut) about two possible VBIEDs (Vehicle-Borne Improvised Explosive Device), a black and a white car. The blocking position had been maintained for longer time than planned due to faulty communications procedure, which was caused by a failure of the VOIP system used by US Army; whereas FM was available, it was not used. The spotlight and the green laser used by the US soldiers had proven effective at halting and making the previous cars turn around. Specialist Mario Lozano had first maneuvered the spotlight, and then switched to the machine gun to shoot the Italian's vehicle. The car was estimated to travel at , and it did not brake until fired upon. Eleven rounds were shot on the car, of which five hit the front. A series of unrelated events were registered as contributing to the tragedy: *The travel of ambassador Negroponte by car instead of by helicopter, because of bad weather; *Communications failure between the blocking point and their headquarters; *The daily delay of Ms Sgrena's rescue for several days; *The Italians were not aware of the roadblock; *The soldiers were not aware of the arrival of the Italians. The US report did note that the unit involved in the incident had received inadequate training on how to deploy armored vehicles in blocking position before a roadblock before leaving for Iraq, and for only 10 days with another unit once it arrived. Only one US officer, Captain Green, knew of the fact that Ms. Sgrena was being rescued, after Italian General Mario Marioli mentioned it to him. However, since Marioli added \\"it is best if no one knows\\", Green took it as an order not to pass the information on to others. = Italian report = A report by the Italian governmentItalian report (PDF) on the incident, hosted on the website of Corriere della Sera was published by 2 May. The Italian investigators disagreed on the subjects of the speed of the car, the signaling (or lack of it) before the Americans opened fire, and the question of whether the Americans were aware of Calipari's presence and activities in Baghdad. The Italian report also noted that the Italian investigators claim that \\"senior US officers who arrived on the scene of the shooting had criticized the checkpoint for being poorly illuminated, inadequately signaled and badly positioned.\\" The Italians point that, whereas the US forces were unaware of Calipari's objectives, they were surely aware of his presence, as Calipari and Carpani were given ID badges and obtained sleeping quarters at Camp Victory. Furthermore, they claimed that the knowledge of the operation could in no way have avoided the incident, since there was no predetermined itinerary, due to the mission's nature. It was pointed out that the officer responsible for the blocking point had not properly laid out signs and obstacles, even if the blocking point duty, after a while, clearly would not have been a short one. This left the proper functioning of the blocking point entirely on the shoulders of the two gunners, who already had with other duties, as operating the spotlight. The Americans had claimed that, since such signs are usually in Arabic and English, they would have been useless to the Italians because they would not have understood them; the Italian report considers these allegations \\"mildly put absurd\\", because words like \\"STOP\\" and \\"DANGER\\" are internationally recognized. In fact, stop signs on Italian roads have \\"STOP\\", as in English, written on them, and are identical to those used in the United States. The \\"alert line\\" and the \\"warning line\\" were all at smaller distances that prescribed practice; the \\"stop line\\" was absent altogether. All these were approximately known to the soldiers, but there was no sign for incoming vehicles. In particular, the Alert line was just 120 m from the first military vehicle, instead of the prescribed 200-400 m. This, combined with the lack of signalling, would have forced the gunners to be alert and not get distracted for a single second throughout the 80-minute-long mission. The only signals used were the spotlight and the green laser. The Italian report indicates that they both rely on the quick reactions of the crew operating them, and the laser is especially difficult to point on a moving target in a short time. A distraction on the gunner's side would easily transform a vehicle in a threat to be stopped by force. The Italian report also noted the fact that the soldiers who manned the checkpoint had placed no signs or traffic cones on the roadway indicating the presence of a checkpoint ahead, despite the fact that they were positioned around a nearly 90 degree bend in the road, which obscured the checkpoint from approaching cars: \\"No signs warning traffic of the presence of a US roadblock—one of the most basic precautionary measures. One of the most important rules was not respected by the soldiers manning the checkpoint.\\" The report also indicated that the idea behind the blocking point was inherently dangerous, as approaching vehicles were forced to turn around on a one-way highway. The Italian investigators also faulted the US soldiers for not stringing a concertina wire barrier which could have stopped the car before reaching the roadblock, but the soldiers \\"didn't like to use concertina wire at night because of the danger posed by cars getting tangled up in it and requiring assistance.\\" Conversely, the US Army's report downplayed the absence of signs or other indicators of the roadblock's presence, arguing that they were not effective at night. However, the US Army report indicated that the roadblock unit reportedly had no signs to deploy, since at the time of \\"the 69th's signs—reading—'Stop or you will be shot!' were still in the shop, awaiting a technician to cover up the 'or you will be shot' phrase, deemed offensive, with tape.\\" It is unclear whether these signs would have been used had they been available. The Italian report specifically accuses the US forces of tampering with the crime scene, in an attempt to make a proper investigation impossible. Also, it pointed that estimates of the speed of Sgrena's car varied from to , a strangely spread measurement considering that two soldiers were experienced policemen. The Italian report also claimed that only three seconds elapsed between the warning signals from the mobile checkpoint and the time when the soldiers opened fire. They add that, despite the fact that the car was only travelling at 40 to 50 km/h, this three-second interval did not give the driver enough time to stop the car.  Sgrena's account  Giuliana Sgrena, still in hospital, visited by President of the Italian Republic Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on March 7. \\"The shooting was not justified by the speed of the vehicle\\", said Giuliana Sgrena to the Italian news agency Ansa. \\"Our vehicle rode a normal speed which should not have induced misunderstanding\\", she told Il Manifesto. \\"It was not a checkpoint, but a patrol that fired upon us, right after having illuminated us with a projector\\", according to Giuliana Sgrena. The Italian agent driving the car also denied that the car was traveling at an excessive speed and refused to stop at a checkpoint: \\"We were driving normally. It was a patrol, in an armoured vehicle, that fired without warning.\\" In English-language press, claims appeared about Sgrena claiming that US soldiers and a US tank had fired on the vehicle 300 to 400 times. The 300 to 400 figure was given by Sgrena's companion in Italy, Pier Scolari, who had only talked with her on the phone. The Italian word for \\"tank\\", carro armato, did not appear in most of the Italian accounts; the term \\"tank\\" may be an erroneous translation of blindato, which means \\"armoured vehicle\\" or a HMMWV. A fellow journalist at Il Manifesto claimed that the theory that this was murder attempt by the US forces in order to discourage further hostage-rescue attempts could not be dismissed out of hand. Sgrena claimed that her kidnappers, just before releasing her, had warned her that the American forces would be a danger to her. Independent reporter Naomi Klein, in an interview with Amy Goodman on Democracy Now (Friday, March 25, 2005), indicated firstly that Giuliana Sgrena's injuries were too severe for her to speak, since she still had fluid in her lungs from her gunshot injuries. Sgrena told Klein that her car was not traveling on a public road, but rather on a secured road reserved for officials, connecting the green zone directly to the airport. By virtue of being on that road, Sgrena also indicated that she must have already passed through checkpoints to enter the green zone from whence the road emerged, and that her car was driving slowly with its lights on to make it more visible and identifiable. Klein indicated that Sgrena believes that US soldiers with whom her car checked in may not have radioed ahead to mobile checkpoints to indicate that they were coming, but that they were moving away from the military unit that fired upon them, pointing that the driver, who sat in the front, is alive. In the interview, Naomi Klein also reported that Sgrena also said that she was very disoriented while in captivity, and that her captors didn't want independent journalists in Iraq talking to the Iraqi people. Pier Scolari, Sgrena's life partner, stated that \\"Giuliana had information and the US military did not want her alive\\". \\"The Americans and the Italians knew that the car was arriving.\\" He claims that Sgrena had detailed information about the use of banned weapons during the recent operations in Fallujah (see Operation Phantom Fury). Sgrena has written about alleged use of napalm in Fallujah. Scolari went on to speculate that they were at 700 metres from the airport, which implies that they had crossed all the checkpoints. \\"The whole shooting was heard live by the Presidency of the Council, who was on the phone with one of the agents. Then the US military confiscated and turned off the phones\\", said Scolari, who was then at the Palazzo Chigi. General Casey claimed that Sgrena and Calipari's vehicle had not gone through any prior checkpoints.  Specific findings  = The checkpoint = The checkpoint was said to be manned by the U.S. 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry unit, but later revealed to be manned by a unit of the New York National Guard, which arrived in Iraq four months before the shooting and in Baghdad only one month before. The identity of the soldier who fired remained unknown until it was revealed by a Greek student at the University of Bologna, who recovered access to the censored portions of the report by saving the redacted pdf file as a text file. The soldier who fired the fatal bullet was apparently Mario Lozano, a US National Guardsman. The US is not a member of the International Criminal Court. The soldier will not be tried in a non-US court if he should face a trial. However, the fact that the soldier's name was revealed enables the Italian Investigating Magistrates (in Rome) to indict him in absentia. The standards of US troops at checkpoints has been criticized in the past by human rights associations, and is now under scrutiny. = Satellite footage = On 28 April, CBS News released a report based on the Pentagon's analysis of an alleged time-stamped satellite footage of the incident. By measuring the distance the car traveled at 91 yards (83 m) and the time elapsed (less than three seconds), the Pentagon concluded that vehicle had to be going in excess of 60 mph (100 km/h). However, since the Pentagon has not published the alleged footage, no independent analysis of it has been possible. The Pentagon analysts have not spoken to any news organization besides CBS News. Additionally, the definitive report, later released by the US Army, did not mention any satellite images (not even in the confidential parts, that were accidentally made available), raising questions in the Italian media about whether this footage existed at all. While satellite coverage of Route Irish would be justified, as ambassador Negroponte was traveling on it, the Italian report claimed that weather conditions were so bad that no image could be acquired by satellites. The Italians also reported having asked for such imagery, and being told that the closest pictures available were for 2 and March, due to bad weather. The adverse weather condition was in actuality the reason why ambassador Negroponte moved by car convoy and not by helicopter, which was in turn the reason for the establishment of the blocking point, according to the US report. =Ballistics evidence= Ballistics experts commissioned by the Investigating Magistrates in Rome responsible for a criminal inquiry who examined the car in Rome came to the conclusion that the car was travelling no faster than 45 mph (60 km/h). = Wikileaks Cable = In 2011, WikiLeaks published a cable dating from 9 May 2005 (drawn after the prime minister Silvio Berlusconi had reported the case in parliament) in which the US Embassy in Rome, Mel Sembler, confirms the friendship between Italy and the United States and, to avoid problems, the prime minister makes it clear to the Americans that they \\"let do\\" in showing their version, without providing any contradictory. The ambassador also noted that US investigators was an obvious thing to ask \\"out of the 30 cars that came to the blocking position, why was this the only car fired upon that night?\\" References  External links  * Italian Hostage, Released in Iraq, Is Shot and Wounded by G.I.'s (NY Times March 5, 2005, registration needed) * Giuliana Sgrena's photo (il manifesto) * Giuliana Sgrena profile (BBC) * CNN Guardian Giuliana Sgrena's statement after her release * Jeremy Scahill, AlterNet, March 28, 2005, \\"No Checkpoint, No Self-Defense\\" * CBS 60 Minutes Interview, April 13, 2005, \\"Italian Journalist: U.S. Lied\\" * Interview with Giuliana Sgrena Democracy Now!, April 27, 2005, \\"Giuliana Sgrena Blasts U.S. Cover Up, Calls for U.S. and Italy to Leave Iraq\\" * US military report on the incident including uncovered redacted portions Category:2005 in Iraq Category:Civilian casualties in the Iraq War Category:2005 in Italy Category:SISMI Category:Hostage rescue operations Category:March 2005 events in Asia Category:Italy–United States relations ","title":"Rescue of Giuliana Sgrena"},{"id":"2591918","text":"Social movements are groupings of individuals or organizations which focus on political or social issues.

Newton and Bobby Seale along with their founding of the Oakland Community School, which provided high-level education to 150 children from impoverished urban neighborhoods. Inspired by contemporary research about the essential role of breakfast for optimal schooling, the Panthers would cook and serve food to the poor inner city youth of the area. Initiated in January 1969 at St. Augustine's Church in Oakland, California, the program became so popular that by the end of the year, the Panthers set up kitchens in cities across the US, feeding over 10,000 children every day before they went to school. The Free Breakfast Program became the central organizing activity of the group.Levine, Susan (2008) School Lunch Politics: The Surprising History of America's Favorite Welfare Program. Princeton University Press: Princeton, p.139. https://books.google.ca/books?id=21RB4wX5HdAC&lpg;=PA139 The reach and success of the program in so many communities underscored the inadequacies of the federal government's then-flagging and underresourced lunch programs in public schools across the country. Many of these programs were held in predominantly black neighborhood but also served children of other ethnicity. Despite its successes, Federal authorities attempted to discredit and derail the Free Breakfast Program. Among other actions, authorities raided breakfast program locations while children were eating. As depicted in the 2015 documentary The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution, it was Huey P. Newton, upon release from jail in 1970, who revitalized the breakfast program as a key social focus for the Panthers in Oakland; from exile in Algeria, Eldridge Cleaver protested that prioritizing the breakfast program diluted the true mission of the Black Panther Party, which Cleaver emphasized had to remain an \\"any means necessary\\" political opposition to U.S. government practices, thus concretizing a schism in the leadership of the Black Panther Party – into Cleaver vs. Newton factions – that led to its eventual demise. Survival Programs The Free Breakfast for Children Program was one among more than 60 community social programs created by the Black Panther Party. They were renamed Survival Programs in 1971. These were operated by Party members under the slogan \\"survival pending revolution.\\" Another Survival Program started by the Black Panther Party was referred to as \\"medical self-defense\\" with the creation of healthcare clinics and their own ambulance services. Other survival programs included children development center, free clothing, free busing to prisons, free housing cooperative, free ambulance, etc. Chicago Fred Hampton, leader of the Chicago local, helped organize a number of community programs. These included five different breakfast programs on the West Side, a free medical center, a door to door program of health services (which offered testing for sickle cell anemia), and blood drives for the Cook County Hospital. The Chicago party also reached out to local gangs to clean up their acts, get them away from crime and bring them into the class war. The Party's efforts met with wide success, and Hampton's audiences and organized contingent grew by the day.

Panchamukha (Devanagari: पञ्चमुख) (alternatively Panchamukhi) is a Sanskrit word meaning 'five-faced'. Most of the Hindu deities are shown as having several faces. Origins of the Panchamukhi The origin of Sri Panchamukhi Hanuman can be traced to a story in Ramayana. During the war between Lord Rama and Ravana, Ravana took help of Ahiravana, the king of Pathala. Lord Hanuman in order to protect Lord Rama and Lakshman formed a fortress with his tail. Ahiravana took the form of Vibhishana the noble brother of Ravana and took Lord Rama and Lakshman to Pathala loka. Hanuman entered pathala loka in search of Rama and Lakshmana, He found that life of Ahiravana was hidden in the five lamps which were placed in different directions. He could be killed only by extinguishing all five lamps the same time. To accomplish this Hanuman had to take the form of Panchamukha Hanuman. This form of Hanuman has five faces. Hayagriva, Narasimha, Garuda and Varaha are the four other faces along with Hanuman's face. Hanuman, using the five faces in different directions, blew out the lamps thereby killing Ahiravana. According to Hanumath Prakaranam in Sri Vidyarnavatantram, Anjaneya has five faces (Pancha Mukha) and ten weapons. Hanuman is a great yogi (mystic) having transcended the five senses (Pancha Indriyas). In Kamba Ramayanam (in Tamil), the significance of number five is beautifully narrated as follows: The son of one of the five elements (son of wind - Pavana Thanaya) crossed one of the five elements (water – the ocean), through one of the five elements (sky), met daughter of one of the five elements (daughter of earth - Sita Devi) burnt down Lanka by one of the five elements (fire). Sundara Kanda highlights the heroic exploits of Lord Hanuman at Lanka. By many, it is considered auspicious to circle the Hanuman idol 5 times, 14 times, 23 times, 32 times or any amount in which the digits of which add to five. The pancha mukha hanuman is rare idol of Hanuman. There are many legends and interpretations of this. One of the legend is that Lord Hanuman appeared before Raghavendra Swami in a unique way amalgamating within him the avataras of \\"varaha, garuda, anjaneya, narasimha and hayagreeva\\", thus five-headed. Panchamukhi, located on the south bank of river Tungabhadra near Manchala now known as Mantralayam is where Raghavendra Swami performed penance for 12 long years in a cave. In appreciation of his Yoga, Lord Panchamukhi Pranadevaru, Kollahpura Mahalakshmi, Lord Venkateshwara of Tirupati and Kurmavathara gave him darshan. Then Raghavendra Swami left for Mantralaya where he entered into Samadhi. A temple, the Panchamukhi Anjaneyaswamy temple, was constructed on the spot where Raghavendra Swami performed penance. Details of Panchamukaa Panchamukhi Hanuman Statue at Shirdi in Maharashtra India. The front (east) facing head is that of Lord Hanuman, south facing is Narasimha, north facing is Varaha, rear facing (cant be seen in the image) is Garuda and finally the head atop the four heads is Hayagriva East facing Anjaneya to grant Ishta Siddhi to humanity. South facing Karala Ugraveera Narasimha to grant Abhista Siddhi to humanity. West facing Mahaveera Garuda to grant Sakala Sowbhagya to humanity. North facing Lakshmi Varaha to grant Dhana Prapthi to humanity. Urdhva Mukha being Hayagriva to grant Sarva Vidya Jaya Prapthi to humanity. Interpretations of Panchamukha Panchamukha can be interpreted as the five ways of praying to God in Hindu philosophy. These five ways are known as naman, smaran, keerthanam, yacham and arpanam. The five faces of Panchamukaa are each a depiction of one these five forms of worship. Hanuman always used to naman, smaran and keerthanam of Rama. He totally surrendered (arpanam) to Rama. He also begged (yachanam) Rama to bless him with undivided love. From the Bhagavat Gita In the Bhagavat Gita, Lord Krishna tells Arjun, \\"He who acts for me, who is engrossed in me, who is my devotee, who is free from attachment, he reaches me\\". We find all these 5 qualities enshrined in Hanuman. Each of his faces represent these five divine qualifications. Maybe an artist thought this over before making the Vigraham. There is a belief that one of the faces is that of Sri Vinayaka. Half Ganesha and half Hanuman The idol of Adyanta Maha Prabhu depicts a figure of half Anjaneya and half Vinayaka. At Madya Kailas temple Adyar Madras, the idol is an amalgam of Sri Vigneshwara and Sri Anjaneya in the style of Ardhanareeswara (Siva and Parvati) and Sri Sankaranarayana (a combination of Siva and Narayana). The word Aadiyantha stands for \\"beginning to end\\" (Aadi = beginning & Antha = end). There is a Tamil saying \\"Begin with Ganesa and end up with Anjaneya\\". Many people visit the temple to receive a blessing of the \\"Twins\\" against the influence of Navagrahas. The importance of the idol is that Sri Vigneswara and Sri Anjaneya are the only two deities who are totally free from any influence over them whatsoever by the Navagrahas. It is believed that, the devotees can and do influence the Navagrahas themselves proportionate to the devoutness with which the devotees address themselves to Sri Aadiyanta Prabhu.

Background Portman was the son of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman and Lady Emma Lascelles, daughter of Henry Lascelles, 2nd Earl of Harewood. Political career Portman was elected to Parliament for Shaftesbury in 1852, a seat he held until 1857, and then represented Dorset from 1857 to 1885. In 1888 he succeeded his father and entered the House of Lords. Estates At the end of the nineteenth century the 99-year leases on the family properties in London came up for renewal, generating a colossal income for Lord Portman of some £100,000 a year. With this fortune he commissioned Norman Shaw to build a new mansion for him at the family seat in Bryanston, Dorset. Within 30 years, however, it had been sold to Bryanston School, which is still based there. This was because it rapidly became anachronistic and uneconomic even for an aristocratic family to occupy a house on such a scale, and the family was also crippled by death duties when the second Viscount's heir and his heir's heir died within ten years of him. Family Son of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman (9 July 1799 – 19 November 1888) and Lady Emma Lascelles (16 March 1809 – 8 February 1865) Lord William Henry Berkeley Portman married Mary Selina Charlotte FitzWilliam (9 JAN 183 - 3 JAN 1899), daughter of William Charles FitzWilliam (18 JAN 1812-8 NOV 1835), son of the 5th Earl Fitzwilliam,(1786–1857) and Lady Selina Charlotte Jenkinson, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Liverpool, on 21 June 1855.http://thepeerage.com/p1217.htm#i12168 They had six sons and two daughters: * Hon.

Neamț Citadel was a fortress rumored to have been built in the thirteenth century by the Teutonic Knights, in defence against Tatar incursions. In 1476, after defeating the Moldavian armies in the Battle of Valea Albă, the Ottoman Empire Sultan Mehmet II forced the Moldavian voivode Ştefan cel Mare to retreat to Cetatea Neamţului. However, as legend says, his mother refused to let him enter the stronghold, and instead advised him to go north into what is now Bukovina and gather a new army. While Ştefan was in Bukovina gathering more forces, Mehmet II laid siege to Cetatea Neamţului. He positioned his cannons on a nearby hill, and began bombarding the stronghold, causing much damage. The Moldavian garrison was at the point of surrender, when a German prisoner held in the dungeons had the idea of using the cannons against the Ottoman position on the hill. His idea was put into practice, and soon the camp of the Turks was being bombarded, forcing Mehmet II to leave the area. The event is recorded by the late Moldavian chronicle of Ion Neculce. Siege of John III Sobieski A historical but romanticized event would have taken place probably during the early years Dimitrie Cantemir's rule in Moldavia, during the latter part of the 17th century and early 18th century. The story is as following: on their way back after raiding Moldavia, the 25,000 men-strong army of Polish king John III Sobieski came across Cetatea Neamţului, defended by less than 20 men. The Poles attacked the stronghold, believing that it contained necessary provisions. After over a week of siege, the small Moldavian garrison surrendered. Legend has it that, moved by the determined opposition from such a minuscule force, the Polish monarch granted life and free passage to the Moldavians in the garrison and gave them ranks in the Polish army. Although a few historians contest the authenticity of this legendary siege, it nevertheless had a very important place in 19th century Romanian consciousness, finding its most popular version in Costache Negruzzi's novelette called Sobieski şi românii (Sobieski and the Romanians: the title in itself indicates his attitude towards the events described), but also in the poem Cetatea Neamţului by George Cosbuc Category:1476 in Europe Neamt Citadel Neamt Citadel Category:Military history of Romania Category:History of Western Moldavia Category:Conflicts in 1476 Neamt Category:1476 in the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Siege of Neamț Citadel"},{"id":"2591959","text":"Arunachal Pradesh is a state of India. It is known for dance music, which comes in many different styles. Dances from the region are often ritual in nature, but are also celebratory. They are mostly group dances, though others are restricted to men. Dances include popir, ponung and pasi kongki (of the Adi), rekham pada (of the Nishing), aji lhamu (of the Monpa) and hiirii khaniing (of the Apatani). Idu Mishmi ritual dance The Idu Mishmis have a ritual dance and a fertility dance. The ritual dance is performed by the priest or priestess in the ceremonies of Ai-ah, Ai-him, Mesalah and Rren. The fertility dance is performed on the last day of the Rren ceremony. There is no definite myth about the origin of this ritual dance. According to local tradition, the first priest who officiated in a funeral ceremony was Chineuhu and his brother Ahihiuh, was the first priest who officiated in the other three ceremonies in which this dance forms a part. This dance is associated with the priestly office. Besides the priest, there are three or four other dancers who are selected from amongst the spectators. In addition, it is the usual dress which consists of a loin-cloth, a short-sleeved coat, and a sword slung on the right side, a leather bag slung on the left side and a few bead- necklaces, the priest wears a few other articles. These articles are an apron with particular designs, a head-band decorated with two or three rows of cowries, a necklace studded with the teeth of tiger and bear and a few metal bells. A priestess wears these special articles in addition to the usual Mishmi woman's dress of a skirt, a long-sleeved coat and bead-necklaces. The priestess is generally accompanied by female dancers. The accompanying dancers wear the usual dress. The dancers stand in a line, the priest is second either from the right or left. During the dance, one dancer standing at one end of the line plays a small drum slung from his neck. The priest and the other two dancers play a very small semi-globular single-membrane drum, striking it with a bamboo-stick which is kept tied to the drum with a string. The fifth dancer, if any, plays a horn bugle. When there are five dancers, the priest stands in the middle of the line. He sings a line of invocatory song while all the others play the musical instruments, flex the knees bobbing up and down and alternately raise the right and left heels and stamp these on the ground in time to the drum-beats. When the priest finishes singing the line, others repeat it in chorus. Again the priest sings another line of the song which the others repeat in chorus and thus it goes on. After a prelude of flexing of knees and stamping of heels, they place one foot forward and immediately bring the other up beside it. If in the first step, the right foot is taken forward, then in the next step it is the left one. After each step, they flex the knees. Thus, they dance forward to the accompaniment of drumbeats and invocatory song. When they have danced forward for some distance, they dance backward with the same movement. Thus they dance moving forward and backward. Sometimes they break away from the line formation and the four dancers standing in the four corners sing an invocatory song, play the musical instruments and dance flexing the knees and raising the right and left heel alternately and stamping these on the ground. Now and then they change positions dancing all the time but facing inward. Sometimes they dance in a circle following one another with tripping steps. In another movement, they dance sideways either in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. They stand in a semicircle and in the anti-clockwise movement, they take one step with the right foot to the right and immediately bring the left foot beside the right one. Thus they dance in a circle, flexing the knees after each step. The priest does not demand any money for his priestly services, but the performer usually remunerates him according to his ability. The remuneration may also be paid in kind, e.g. with handloom coat, brass utensils or pigs. The music (Hindi: संगीत) is diverse because of India's vast cultural diversity. Though it might be started with devotional songs later it covered each & every part of contemporary human life including psychology, philosophy, anatomy(Deha- Tatva), socio-economic condition, love, day to day living etc. and in many of them you will find deep insight into life. There are numerous eminent bards/saints or Fakirs who had contributed a lot in this field. A few of them are Kabir, Moinuddin Chishti, Lalon Fakir and many more. Main classification can be done based on the regional languages. It has many forms including bhangr, lavani, dandiya and Rajasthani. The arrival of movies and pop music weakened folk music's popularity, but saints and poets to have large musical libraries and traditions to their name, often sung in thumri semi-the folk music of India is dance-oriented. Dances and music about Gita Govinda Project Dance forms an important aspect of the socio-cultural heritage of the people. They dance on important rituals, during festivals and also for recreation. The dances of the people of Arunachal are group- where both men and women take part. There are however some dances such as igo dance of the Mishmi priests, war dance of the Adis, Noctes and Wanchos, ritualistic dance of the Buddhist tribes, which are male dances. Females are not allowed to participate in these dances. Some of the popular folk dances of the people are Aji Lamu(Monpa), Roppi(Nishing), Buiya(Nishing), Hurkani(Apatani), Popir(Adi), Pasi Kongki(Adi), Chalo(Nocte),Ponung(Adi), Rekham Pada (Nishing), Lion and Peacock dance (Monpa) and so on. Most dances are performed to the accompaniment of songs sung generally in chorus. Musical instruments like drums and Cymbals are played. The folksong of Pailibos relate more to their folk history, mythology and description of their known past. Themes of songs are like fables involving creatures or the animal and urgent words signifying moral deduction. Following are their chief folksong, sung on different occasion: * Ja-Jin-Ja: On occasion of feasts and merriment, during marriages or other social meets, this song is sung. Both men and women sing it in chorus or individually. But once the song starts, all those who are present join them in singing. * Baryi: It is a song which narrate their history, their religious lore and mythology. Its whole cycle takes hours to complete. It is also a feature of festivals or of occasion of important social or religious gatherings.

Life and career Until he was 11, he went to school in Fort Lee, New Jersey, where he grew up. He then commuted to the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, graduating in 1967. He wrote poetry from this time, inspired by Keats and Kenneth Rexroth translations, among other works. He started college at the University of Wisconsin–Madison but dropped out and after taking a year out of school, he ended up, 1971, at the University of Victoria on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Drawn to the New York poets, including Frank O’Hara, Kleinzahler then discovered the work of Basil Bunting, who had a major influence on Kleinzahler's search for his own voice in poetry. He described Bunting's 1966 long poem Briggflatts (which its author described as \\"an autobiography, but not a statement of fact\\")Bunting, B. 1968. Collected Poems. London, Fulcrum Press as \\"everything I wanted in poetry.” Bunting taught a creative writing course at Victoria: \\"He began with some poems by Hardy and Hopkins, The Wreck of the Deutschland, and went up to Yeats and Pound, then David Jones, Williams, the poets who were important to Bunting, Hugh MacDiarmid, Lorine Niedecker, and H.D. All he did was smoke unfiltered Player’s and read to us\\". The Anglo-American poet Thom Gunn (1929–2004) was also a major influence: \\"the honest treatment of the poetic material at hand, not slipping into rhetorical or poetic postures, inflating subject matter or dodging difficulty,\\" Kleinzahler explained in an interview in The Paris Review in the fall of 2007. Gunn would become a close friend.William Corbett (Fall 2007). \\"August Kleinzahler, The Art of Poetry No. 93\\". The Paris Review. William Carlos Williams was also an important source of inspiration. Amassing gambling debts and wanted by the police, Kleinzahler's brother committed suicide in 1971, when the poet was 21. They were very close and Kleinzahler was devastated by the death. The book Storm over Hackensack is dedicated to him and Cutty, One Rock is about him. Kleinzahler commented \\"he remains a sort of lodestar for me, encouraging my better, braver self.\\" After college, Kleinzahler spent a year in Alaska working in \\"manpower jobs: hard labor\\" and then got a job at the Alaska State Museum. He got his teaching credentials and then lived in Montreal for two and a half years. A passionate blues lover, Kleinzahler wrote a music column for the San Diego Reader for many years. He has lived in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco but has retained strong ties to his old home base in New Jersey. In 2005 he was named the first poet laureate of Fort Lee. Kleinzahler is the author of ten books of poetry, including The Strange Hours Travelers Keep and Sleeping It Off in Rapid City. He has also published a non-fiction work, Cutty, One Rock (Low Characters and Strange Places, Gently Explained). Allen Ginsberg commented: \\"August Kleinzahler's verse line is always precise, concrete, intelligent and rare - that quality of 'chiseled' verse memorable in Basil Bunting's and Ezra Pound's work.

Originally built to serve the Stockton and Darlington Railway the works grew to cover ( roofed), employing 2750 staff.  History  Shildon was the terminus of the Stockton & Darlington Railway (S&DR;), when it opened in 1825. Its first locomotive superintendent was Timothy Hackworth, who maintained their locomotives at the Soho Works. Thomas Hackworth (Timothy's brother) was works manager at the Soho Works. The beginnings of the works were small - In 1827, Timothy Hackworth built the locomotive Royal George at the Soho Works. It was also in this period that the works received an order from the Tsar of Russia for a locomotive. Shildon produced the engine and Hackworth's son John Wesley Hackworth was dispatched with drivers and mechanics to deliver it to Russia. These works were to be purchased by the S&DR; company in 1855 and closed in 1883. Hackworth was the first of 22 managers of the works in their 151 year history, a post he held between 1833 and 1840. A trade union was formed in 1899 after growing discontent amongst the workers. One of the grievances was a requirement to work overtime. An average working day was 11 hours, 06.00 to 17.00, with overtime taking the working day to 21.00. The men were told that their 'boards' would not be issued for the Saturday shift if they refused the overtime. The boards were where the men recorded their work, without their board they could not work. In 1962 the Shildon Works underwent a £800,000 modernisation following the creation of the British Rail Workshops Division. This saw the works equipped to repair BR wagons and from 1970, wagons from abroad. A notable wagon which came out of the works on this period was the 'Presflo' air-discharge cement wagon along with high capacity coal and Freightliner wagons. The forge at Shildon also produced a large proportion of drop stampings for other railway works. The works repair shop had the capacity to overhaul and repair 800 wagons a week. Production figures show that between 1965 and 1982 the works build 11,083 'Merry-go-round' 32.5 tonne capacity coal hoppers.  Campaign to Save the Works and Closure  = 1982 = The closure of the works was announced on 23 April 1982 by British Rail Engineering Ltd (BREL). At the time of the announcement the works employed 2,600 people and amounted to 86% of the male workforce's manufacturing jobs in the town. Eight days before the announcement of the closure there were rumours that it may come. With negotiations under way local journalists reported being hung up on when trying to call union officials at the works. These negotiations received a blow on 17 April, when works National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) chair Roy Jones collapsed on his way to work from a suspected stroke. He was in London for negotiations on 13 and 14 April and the strain is believed to have caused the stroke. Interviewed in 1990, Sidney Weighell (General Sec. NUR) recalled first hearing of the closure plan - A trade union march was organised for 29 April, which was to assemble at 10am on the playing field of Sunnydale School. Members of the Sedgefield District Council closure working party were authorised to attend as 'approved duty' with pay. The march worked its way through the town, led by figures including Derek Foster MP and Roland Boyes MEP, to the local football ground. BREL set out its case for closure in a special edition of Railtalk Magazine using a question and answer format. On 5 May a joint report by Durham and Sedgefield Councils' planning departments was issued. It stated that closure would result in the loss of 2,180 jobs and leave one in four of the \\"insured population in the Bishop Auckland Employment Exchange area\\" unemployed. A further 450 jobs with suppliers to the works would also be lost. At 19.30 on the evening of 7 May a trades union meeting was held in the works canteen to discuss progress in the campaign to save the facility. A strike was discussed but \\"Derby were lukewarm, but Glasgow suggested an immediate strike because of fears that there would be a dwindling of workshops\\". A protest to London was thought to be a better idea and a train chartered to take people to the capital. Ultimately it was decided that travellers would pay £5 each with the remaining amount coming from the fighting fund. In his 1990 interview Weighell recalled the Shildon branch of the NUR - Dennis Lees arrived as acting manager of the works on 10 May, replacing Derek Clarke who had been made acting manager at the Doncaster facility. On 25 May a deputation left the for London with 600 people travelling south in eleven coaches from Darlington at 07.15 bound for Kings Cross. Arriving at 11.00 the party marched on the British Rail (BR) headquarters. There they delivered 630 letters to the chairman of BR Sir Peter Parker. They moved on to the Houses of Parliament to lobby members of parliament before returning to Kings Cross and arriving back at Darlington at 22.20. On 29 May there was a large rally in Shildon with marchers moving off from the Civic Hall to the park at 10.30 and speeches beginning at 11.15. Official guests included Albert Booth MP (Shadow Minister for Transport), Derek Foster MP (Constituency MP), Jack Cunningham MP (Chair. Labour Northern Group of MPs), Ted Fletcher and Roland Boyes MEP (Constituency MEP). An official at the rally recalled the day - On the same day the Northern Echo reported that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was to meet with local MP Derek Foster to discuss the Shildon closure plan. On 4 June BR announced a postponement of the closure with a decision to come in early 1983 on the future of the works. Union leaders at a local level said they \\"delighted that our industrial strength has brought about a change of attitude.\\" However, the NUR leaders in London were more cautious that a postponement was not a reprieve. A local newspaper did not draw this distinction and declared - The proposed Channel Tunnel came up for discussion at a meeting of the Works Working Party on 24 June and the need for wagons for the new tunnel. On 18 August acting works manager Dennis Lees wrote to all staff - The Daily Mirror ran a two-page spread about the town on 4 October - In December 1982 the Association of District Councils (ADC) reported that BR wagons at that time carrying scrap metal were to be 'life-expired and withdrawn from service by May 1984'. This announcement resulted in discussions at the Policy and Resources Committee of Sedgefield District Council on 13 December. There it was pointed out that the withdrawal of these wagons would put a serve strain on road haulage resources. It became clear that some local authorities were to replace the withdrawn wagons and apply for railway facilities under provisions of the Railways Act 1974 (Section 8). The act allowed for private or public industry to build their own access to sidings on the rail network. Hopes that these new wagons would be built at Shildon were soon dashed, with the Policy Resource Committee reporting - Any new wagons for the movement of scrap metal in areas that would be adversely impacted by an increase in road haulage were to be built by private industry. = 1983 = J. Palette (Dir. of Personnel, British Rail Board) confirmed the closure of Shildon Works in 1984. In a letter to unions on 18 February 1983 he stated that work would be transferred from the town to work in Doncaster and other BREL sites. The Works Joint Committee gathered on 4 March to discuss the closure announcement. Local MP Derek Foster believed that the campaign to save the works had been a \\"tremendous achievement\\" but that it had made little difference to the outcome. Some regarded the meeting as a wake for the works while others wanted to redouble efforts and continue to campaign. In June, Minister for Trade and Industry Norman Lamont wrote to Councillor G. W. Terrans (Leader, Durham County Council Labour Group) - Sedgefield District Council appreciated the need for government grants and subsidies to encourage new industries into the area. These incentives were dependent on the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) classification. The council were seeking to upgrade their area from an Assisted Area (AA) to a Special Development Area (SDA). The Evening Despatch reported in August 1983 - = 1984 = Labour leader Neil Kinnock MP visited Shildon on 28 April 1984 and spoke on the situation - An announcement came that the works would officially close on 30 June 1984. BREL offered the town a £300,000 loan guarantee package but this was thought to be not enough. Then on 7 June, David Mitchell (Parliamentary Under Sec. Dept. of Transport) set up a group at the ministry to try and reach agreement on an improved offer. The taking up of the railway lines linking the works to the network were reported by the Northern Echo on 25 June -  References  Sources * Simmons, J., (1986) The Railway in Town and Country, Newton Abott: David and Charles * Larkin, E.J., Larkin, J.G., (1988) The Railway Workshops of Great Britain 1823-1986, Macmillan Press * External links * North East History: The Stockton and Darlington Railway Category:Stockton and Darlington Railway Category:Railway workshops in Great Britain Category:North Eastern Railway (UK) Category:1825 establishments in England Category:Shildon ","title":"Shildon railway works"},{"id":"2592115","text":"Frantic may refer to: * Frantic (film), a 1988 film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Harrison Ford * Frantic (video game), a Commodore VIC-20 space shoot-em-up video game * Frantic Films, a Canadian Visual Effects company * \\"Frantic\\" (song), a song by Metallica * \\"Frantic\\" (album), an album by British singer Bryan Ferry * Frantic, an album by Scottish band Gun * Operation Frantic, World War II shuttle bombing missions * Frantic Factory, the third level in Donkey Kong 64 * Frantic Magazine, a monthly humour and parody magazine, published in the UK by Marvel UK from 1979 to 1980 ","title":"Frantic"},{"id":"2592117","text":"Romanworld is the debut album by American garage house producer Romanthony.

Biography Born in Harrow, London, the daughter of a local vicar Henry William and Emily Frances Watson. At the age of sixteen Watson played her first match at the Edgbaston Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club. It was a successful debut, winning the singles competition by defeating her sister Lillian in the final and winning the doubles competition with her. In 1884 Watson participated in the Irish Ladies' Championship and defeated the reigning Irish champion May Langrishe 6–3, 6–2, 6–2. She was also victorious in the mixed doubles tournament winning the title with multiple Wimbledon champion William Renshaw. Undefeated in tournament play, in 1884 the nineteen-year-old Watson won the first-ever Ladies' Singles title at Wimbledon. Playing in white corsets and petticoats, from a field of thirteen competitors, she defeated Lilian 6–8, 6–3, 6–3 in the final to claim the title and a silver flower basket valued at 20 guineas. 1885 was a year of great success for Watson, who remained unbeaten in singles and lost only one set. She repeated her success at the 1885 Wimbledon championships. In a field of just 10 entries she easily won the quarter- and semi-finals and in the final defeated Blanche Bingley 6–1, 7–5. She successfully defended her title at the 1885 Irish Championships against Louise Martin. For two sets, there was little to choose between them, but in the decider, Watson outstayed her opponent to win 6–2, 4–6, 6–3. In 1886, the year the Challenge Round was introduced for women, Bingley turned the tables, defeating Watson 6–3, 6–3 in the final to take the title.

The mine became one of the most noted mercury producers in the world. During the 150 years since the Sulphur Bank was discovered, the area has drawn geologists, inspired unique scientific theories, established constitutional case law and now attracts environmental scientists who study the impact of mercury contamination within the Cache Creek watershed of northern California and the Sacramento River-Delta Region and San Francisco Bay. History Beginning in 1856, the mine was first worked for borax. Mining for sulfur began in 1865, and produced 2,000,000 pounds (909,090 kg) in four years. Mercury ore was mined intermittently by underground and open-pit methods from 1873 to 1957. Sulphur Bank Mine was credited with a total output of 92,400 flasks (7.02 million pounds) by 1918. The mine was an important producer during both world wars. The mine closed in 1957 and is a California Historical Landmark (#428). Sulphur Bank Mine became an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) superfund site in 1990. =California Borax Co.= Borax Lake Although the hot springs of the Sulphur Bank contained borax, the search led John Allen Veatch to nearby Borax Lake where the California Borax Company established the first commercial borax mining operation in the U. S. beginning in 1860 and ceasing in 1868. The company established land claims to Borax Lake, the Sulphur Bank and Sulphur Springs in Colusa County. The officers of the California Borax Company included physicians Veatch, William Ayers and Robert Oxland; and lawyers Henry Halleck, Archibald Peachy, Frederick Billings and Solomon Heydenfeldt. The fascination with borax resulted from the fact that boric acid was critical as a flux in metal working. All borax at that time was imported, mostly from the Tuscan Lakes area of Italy. The California Borax Company did engage in sulfur mining at Sulphur Bank (extracting 2 million pounds in 4 years) for a time before the company’s collapse in 1868 and the sulfur was discovered to be contaminated with cinnabar. =Discovery of cinnabar= Between the time of Veatch’s discovery and the working of sulfur, a minor mining excitement led to the discovery of cinnabar in the northern reaches of Napa County (of which Lake County was then a part). The Silverado rush in the winter of 1858–59 caused “every unemployed man from Soscol to Calistoga turned prospector. Blankets and bacon, beans and hard bread rose to a premium,” reported William T. Montgomery in a light-hearted sketch of the great silver rush that resulted in enormous finds of worthless iron pyrites. But the rush did result in the discovery of cinnabar in 1860. Montgomery, who became a stockholder in the X.L.C.R. (pronounced \\"excelsior\\") mine, is the only known source of the often-repeated tale of Seth Dunham and L.D. Jones discovering cinnabar in a road cut of the Barryessa–Lower Lake Road (now Morgan Valley Road) in what became known as the Knoxville mining district, about a dozen miles south east of the Sulphur Bank in present-day Napa County. The X.L.C.R. became known as the Redington mine a decade later and was second only to the New Almaden mine in production. Another account of the discovery of cinnabar in the same region is contained in the December 1861 edition of Scientific American magazine. “There has been recently opened an extensive cinnabar vein, in Napa County, which promises to be rich. This was discovered by John Newman, of Pope’s Valley. The cinnabar was discovered by means of the fires which are made to burn off the chaparral,” the magazine reported. Newman became a stockholder of the Phoenix mine in that location. These early discoveries of mercury-bearing ores did not become viable mercury producers until 1872, when the price of mercury and improved smelting methods resulted in the establishment of many mines in Lake and Napa counties. =John and Tiburcio Parrott= In 1873, the defunct California Borax Company was acquired by Tiburcio and John Parrott, William F. Babcock and Darius Ogden Mills, for the purpose of quicksilver mining at Sulphur Bank. Until 1875, when the mine shipped 5,218 flasks of mercury, it operated under the name of the borax company but then changed the name to the Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mining Company. Tiburcio Parrott Tiburcio Parrott was controlling partner of the new company, and it was he who was later jailed when the company refused to abide by a state law excluding Chinese from employment. Tiburcio’s father, John Parrott, was a wealthy banker. Parrot and Company, of San Francisco was a major landholder and banking firm. John Parrot’s weekend retreat consisted of in San Mateo County, California. John Parrot also owned 8% of the giant New Almaden quicksilver mine in Santa Clara County. Babcock was an officer of Parrott and Company and was a partner with Tiburcio Parrott in an import-export company. Mills was also asset rich, founding the Bank of California, but who had stepped down as bank president by the time of the Sulphur Bank mercury mining era. It was Mills who later saved Bank of California with his personal assets when it failed under William Chapman Ralston. The period of 1875 to 1883 was the heyday of the mining activity. The Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mine often had the highest output after the New Almaden, the New Idria (San Benito County) and the Redington. However, profits were tempered by the temperature of the underground workings. The Chinese miners, who did most of the underground work, had to endure temperatures of 176 °F (80 °C) because the ore body followed the path of at least three hot springs at the site. The mercury was shipped in iron flasks weighing about 90 pounds each and containing 76.5 pounds of mercury. The closest rail service was away in Calistoga. The wagon trip over the crest of Mt Saint Helena via the Lawley Toll Road to the rail head could take a week or more. Just how much mercury was shipped from Sulphur Bank is a matter of some estimation. The History of Lake County 1881 puts production at 12,341 flasks in the two-years 1874-1876. Walter W. Bradley, state mineralogist, estimated total output to 1918 at 92,400 flasks. The mine was only sporadically worked after 1883, so the majority of the output can be attributed to the Parrott era. Eastlake township The township of Eastlake was established next to the mine. The mining superintendent, Ferdinand Fiedler listed his address at Eastlake as did assistant superintendent, J.E. Tucker. The German-born Fiedler was the furnace operator and postmaster at the New Almaden mine before taking the post of superintendent at Sulphur Bank. The mine’s owner-investors all lived in San Francisco. Eastlake was directly adjacent to the mining property. After the mine closed, Eastlake was abandoned. Those who worked at the mine in 1880 constituted an ethnic soup of foreign-born workers. The 1880 federal census, dated June 22, 1880, listed 218 Chinese-born men and 40 Occidentals associated with the mine. Only a few of the white miners were born in the United States. Immigrants from Sweden and Norway constituted the bulk of the European miners. A few of the miners were Irish born as were two Mexicans. Most of the miners had no families present but some of the managers had families and children living at Eastlake. None of the Chinese miners had families present. Mine workings Diagram showing surface cuts and shafts The quicksilver mine was partially an open pit and partially a tunneling operation. Three shafts and a series of lateral tunnels known as drifts comprised the underground works. The shafts were known as the Hermann, the Fiedler and the Parrott. From historical documents it appears only the Wagon-Spring Cut and Bath-house Cut (open pits) and the Parrott shaft were used for mining until 1880. By 1881 the other two shafts were also in place, one of which reached . Bath-House and Parrott flooded then and were not further used. \\"At Sulphur Bank tunnels were used in developing and mining the ore just under and in the basalt capping. In depth, development and mining proceeded through shallow shafts. Operations from any one shaft were carried on until the hot water and gas made conditions intolerable, when the shaft was abandoned and a new one was sunk a short distance away.\\" Curt Schuette, the author of the US Bureau of Mines bulletin #335 observed. The cinnabar ore, known also as mercury sulfide (84 parts mercury to 16 parts sulfur), was treated in furnaces and retorts near the mine. The essential refining method was to turn the mercury into gas and recondense it to quicksilver. The sulfur would burn and convert to sulfur dioxide; the waste rock associated with the ore is known as calcine, or burnt rock, would be dumped near the lake shore, out of the way of the mining works. All of the furnaces at all of the mines in the vicinity were wood fired. End of the Parrott era Quicksilver production chart (partial), showing 1880 to 1884 The heyday of quicksilver mining came to an end when the price of quicksilver dropped to $25 per flask from a high in 1874 of $120. The Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mining Company was bankrupt by 1883. Tiburcio Parrot’s biographer states the company’s stock went into default, which suggests the stock was pledged against loans to cover operating expenses. Who the creditors were or to whom the mine was sold is unknown. A specialized census report indicates 2,283 flasks were produced there in 1890, which was a fraction of the output reported during the census of 1880 (10,706 flasks). The township of Eastlake, which included a dry goods store, post office and a hotel-restaurant was abandoned after the mine’s closure. The mine was apparently inactive through the remainder of the 1880s. Geologist George F. Becker visited the mine several times between 1883 and 1888. Becker’s survey of quicksilver mining in the western United States usually includes the names of watchmen or mine personnel at the sites he studied, but no names are mentioned during his visits to Sulphur Bank. The Fiedler shaft was flooded and overflowing into Clear Lake in 1887. The mine was operated sporadically in the 1890s, evidenced by the presence of mine superintendent Richard White. John Parrott died in 1884, and his widow, Abigail inherited control of Parrott and Company. Abigail was not the mother of Tiburcio Parrott. He was born 1842, the bastard child of John Parrott and Deloris Ochoa. John Parrott was the American Consul to Mexico at Mazatlan. The War with Mexico in 1845-1846 put a temporary end to the diplomacy business. John Parrott then set up his banking and real estate business in San Francisco in 1848 or 1850. Tiburcio Parrott was educated in the United States and Europe. After the failure of the mercury mine, he spent the last decade of his life founding and operating a wine estate, near the township of St. Helena, California. There he became closely associated with the German-born Beringer Brothers: Frederick and Jacob. Tiburcio Parrott died in 1894. In 1901, the Sulphur Bank mine was sold to a group of New York bankers. =Empire Consolidated= By 1902, Sulphur Bank mine was operating as the Empire Consolidated Quicksilver Company and a new shaft, the Empire, was sunk. Riley A. Bogges was listed as owner/ general manager. “It is greatly to be regretted that the management of this property has not taken pains to preserve geological descriptions of the underground works, which are all caved in, except the Empire shaft, now in progress of sinking. The latter is so tightly timbered, owing to bad ground, that it offers no opportunity’ to study the formations through which it has passed,” wrote William Forstner, of California State Mining Bureau. He also observed that Sulphur Bank had the appearance of an abandoned hydraulic mine. Riley Boggess Boggess, often spelled as Bogges, (the 1900 census gives the spelling as Boggess ) got the mine mired in court battles in the state of New York, where he also lined up his investors. “Riley A. Boggess had been connected with the mine, and in 1901 he promoted the formation of the Empire Consolidated Quicksilver Mining Company, floated a considerable amount of stock in the East and secured the names of prominent New York capitalists for directors. The new company purchased the Sulphur Banks and the Abbott mines in Lake county, and the Central and Empire mines in Colusa county. The mines were never opened, and the stockholders’ money was wasted. The record of the Sulphur Banks since has been constant litigation and abandoned works, but it is believed by many that rich ore still exists there,” as the history of Mendocino and Lake Counties summarized events. The summary appears reasonably accurate based on New York Times reports: “A big deal in California quicksilver mines was made today when New York capitalists bought for $1,000,000 the Sulphur Bank and Abbot mines in Lake County and Empire and Central, in Colusa County, which are among the largest producers in the world. From the first two mines $2,000,000 in quicksilver has been taken but the Colusa mines are only partly developed,” the paper reported on October 11, 1901. The article lists the buyers as bankers William Dowe, William Kimball, William Scherer, and iron monger Henry Adams as director. Deal collapses The deal began to unravel a year later. The broker of the first deal, John T. Reed, won a suit against Boggess, the Times reported July 25, 1902, and in the July 6 edition, the paper noted a lawsuit filed by Katrryn Plumer, of Brooklyn alleging Boggess, Reed, and others had defrauded her of her 1897 investment in the mines. In addition, a July 17, 1902 article related a series of complex stock manipulations involving the Empire Consolidated Quicksilver Mining Company. There is no evidence how Plumer’s claim was resolved, but the millions of dollars allegedly on or under the table boiled down to $750 in cash by 1903. “United States Marshal Henkel sold by auction yesterday 379,985 shares of the stock of the Empire Consolidated Quicksilver Mining Company, which was bid in for $750 by William Hughes of 100 Nassau Street. The stock was seized ... to satisfy a judgement ... against Riley A. Boggess. The stock had been pledged with the North American Trust Company to secure loans. ... ” The Times reported April 21, 1903. =George Ruddock= The Sulphur Bank mercury mine next became the possession of George T. Ruddock, a mining engineer and amateur botanist, who lived in Alameda in 1910 and San Francisco by 1920. How he came into possession of the property and surrounding acreage is unclear. Walter W. Bradley’s report on quicksilver mining in California lists Ruddock as the owner of Sulphur Bank by 1918 and that Ruddock had the mine under lease to an H.W. Gould. State mineralogist W.W. Bradley indicated Sulphur Bank had not been worked or de-watered since 1906. The old Empire Consolidated Quicksilver Mining Company was now headed by Riley Boggess’ wife, Emma, which still held possession of the Abbott and other mines near Sulphur Creek in Colusa and Lake counties. Neither the Abbott nor Sulphur Bank were being actively worked. “For the present at least, no underground work is planned, there being several hundred thousand tons at the surface, estimated as material available for treatment ... Practically all of the dumps in sight and some over the hill on the north side, have concentratable values in cinnabar. The material can be cheaply excavated with a steam shovel and transported to the mill by motor trucks, as it will have to be moved distances up to mile and raised to the top of the mill bin,” Bradley reported. Whether the plan for mining exclusively by open-pit methods proceeded is uncertain but that method was employed a decade later when the Bradley Mining Company acquired the Sulphur Bank mercury mine. =Bradley Mining Company= A young Frederick W. Bradley, or \\"Fred\\", honorary graduate of University of California Frederick Worthen Bradley, the head and founder of the family-owned Bradley Mining Company, became both famous and infamous in 19th Century American history, unknowingly surviving two assassination attempts and setting records for low-cost ore production. His history is well documented on both the internet and print. There is no known connection between Bradley Mining Company and Walter Wadsworth Bradley, who would become the California State Mineralogist. Frederick's father, Henry Sewall Bradley came to California to work the gold fields, became a land surveyor instead, and died in 1881 when Frederick Bradley was midway through his education at the University of California. Frederick Bradley dropped out of school, borrowed $5,000 and took over ownership/management of the existing Spanish mine on the south fork of the Yuba River, setting a record for low- cost ore production. He was inducted into the Mining Hall of Fame in 1988. \\"Fred\\" W. Bradley, founder of Bradley Mining Company By 1893, Frederick Bradley assumed management (but not ownership) of the Bunker Hill lead mine, near Coeur d' Alene, Idaho. Between 1894 and 1904 Bradley made the money- losing low-grade ore profitable but at the cost of a civil war between the mining company and the Western Federation of Miners union. Testimony at the 1906 murder trial of Big Bill Haywood, the union treasurer disclosed the two assassination attempts on Bradley in San Francisco in 1904. Bradley then went off to Alaska to turn two money-losing gold operations into profitable ventures. Mt. Bradley in Alaska is named for him. Bradley Mining Company first optioned Sulphur Bank mercury mine from Ruddock in 1927 and then purchased the mine and surrounding . The mine was operated under the name, Sulphur Bank Syndicate, but eventually operated as the Bradley Mining Company. Worthen Bradley, Frederick’s son, became assistant superintendent of the mine soon after he was graduated at the University of California, Berkeley in 1926. He eventually served as president of the Bradley Mining Company. In later years, Worthen Bradley recalled the Bradleys’ interest in the Sulphur Bank mine was generated by a rise in the price of quicksilver. During the Depression years of the 1930s the mine was active or inactive, dependent upon the price, he told a local newspaper in 1955. “We are trying to do with one shovel and two shifts, what we did with several in World War II,\\" Bradley said in 1955. “We are still in the stage of getting started and hope to begin plant operation this month, September. Unfortunately the quicksilver market has declined somewhat since we began work,” The Sulphur Bank mercury mine closed permanently in 1957. Rancho Solfatara Rancho Solfatara sign Frederick Worthen Bradley, the founder of the company, died in 1933. The son, Worthen then took over operation of the mine and developed a summer estate known as Rancho Solfatara on 800 acres (the mine included . Another was added in the 1950s) adjoining the mine. Rancho Solfatara was used first for stock raising to feed 100 resident miners during World War II. During the war the demand for quicksilver skyrocketed because of its use in detonators in munitions. Worthen Bradley died at age 55 in 1959. Helen Pope Bradley, who wed Worthen in 1929, engaged in raising show stock, known as Hereford cattle in 1943. Helen lived until 2006, a month before her 100th birthday. Worthen Bradley was born Frederick Worthen Bradley but used Worthen as his first name. A son, Frederick Worthen Bradley, an attorney, is now the president of the Bradley Mining Company. The Sulphur Bank Mine and Rancho Solfatara are held by the company and the Worthen Bradley Trust. Present day The mine currently consists of mine tailings, waste rock and a flooded open pit mine (known as the Herman Impoundment or Herman Pit). Approximately two million cubic yards of mine wastes and tailings remain on the site. The Herman pit, which is filled with acidic water, covers to a depth of and is located upslope of Clear Lake. The Elem Tribal Colony of Pomo Indians is located directly adjacent to the mine property. A freshwater wetland is located to the north of the mine, and critical habitat for three endangered species of wildlife, the peregrine falcon, southern bald eagle, and yellow-billed cuckoo, is less than a quarter- mile from the site. The mine site has been implicated by the EPA in mercury pollution of Clear Lake, but the allegations are disputed by Bradley Mining Company, the last and current owner of the mine. = The EPA years= The discovery of mercury in the fish of Clear Lake was accidental. The California Department of Fish and Game's biologist, Larry Week was testing fish samples in 1976 for DDD, a close relative of the pesticide DDT, and discovered high levels of mercury in fish tissue. During the next decade, various state and federal agencies conducted tests of the lake and mine site resulting in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) placing Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine in 1990 on the National Priorities List (NPL) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or CERCLA. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry was also established by CERCLA under the federal Department of Health and Human Services. The Registry assesses the health hazards and risks at contaminated sites and makes recommendations reducing those hazards. The mine site has been proposed for listing on the NPL since 1988 and the Registry published its report the next year, concluding Sulphur Bank Mine is a public health hazard. (See also Mercury poisoning.) Superfund EPA warning sign. In 1990, the EPA began studies on the flooded pit, waste rock piles, lake sediments and a nearby wetland. The EPA completed an emergency remediation in 1992, where the slope of mine tailings was cut back along the shoreline, covered with clean soil and reseeded. The agency states that more than of waste rock had been deposited into the lake, and piled up along the shore. The book History of Lake County 1881 gives more detail: \\"The debris is drawn from the bottom of the furnance about every two hours and is wheeled to the far-distant dump on the lake shore.\\" Other EPA cleanup actions included an earthen dam built between the flooded acidic open pit (called the Herman Impoundment after one of the mining shafts named Herman) and the shoreline in 1996, a pipeline to divert surface water runoff away from the pit in 1999, and contaminated soil removal from the adjacent Elem Indian Colony in 1997. =Bradley Mining Company legal action= In 1992, the Bradley Mining Co. petitioned the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals for a review of the EPA's rulemaking listing the mine site on the National Priorities List, asserting that the agency, \\"acted arbitrarily and capriciously in listing the property because the EPA failed to demonstrate that mercury found in an adjacent lake was caused by mining operations and because the Agency incorrectly calculated the risk that the mercury would contaminate usable ground water.\\" The EPA presented a study from 1990 titled Abatement and Control Study: Sulphur Bank Mine and Clear Lake, to support the rulemaking. The EPA asserted that its listing decision was based upon: That mercury levels were much higher closest to the mine site in lake sediment, that the groundwater was at risk for contamination and that soil erosion along the shoreline into the lake is occurring. The court ruled in favor of the EPA and denied the Bradley petition stating, \\" Thus, the record provides a sufficient foundation for the EPA's conclusion that an observed release of mercury occurred.\\" The court also added \\"Given the highly technical issues involved in the Agency's decision to list a facility, this court gives significant deference to the EPA's determination. The judges cited from a ruling in Wisconsin challenging an EPA listing: \\"[T]he importance of EPA's goals, including protecting human life from potentially disastrous contamination and the congressionally mandated need for speedy action,\\" so that \\"[i]t is not necessary that EPA's decisions as to what sites are included on the NPL be perfect, nor even that they be the best.\\" =UC Davis studies= The tests of lake sediments and water for mercury from 1992 through 1998 show increasingly higher levels of mercury from samples taken closest to the mine site. How the mercury is getting into the lake and its food chain is still unclear. The UC Davis researchers' theory is that acid mine drainage is seeping through the contaminated waste rock and then entering the lake from underground in addition to surface runoff, leaching mercury into the lake. The source of the acidity may be the flooded Herman pit which has a tested pH level of 3.2. This underground system is difficult to study as, \\"the miners ripped the relatively compact natural sulfide deposit to pieces, jumbled uneconomic minerals together with miscellaneous overburden rock, and piled the resulting poisonous mélange 30 or 40 feet deep over the tunnel-laced rock of the former underground mine. Finding out how water and air flow through the resulting mess is a very difficult task.\\" This difficulty is shown by tracer experiments conducted by UC Davis in 1997 and 1998 to find the subsurface water flow from the Herman Pit to the lake. The tracers used were Rhodamine-WT, sulfur hexafluoride, and a mixture of sulfur hexafluoride and neon-22. Herman pit in foreground, Mt Konocti in background, Clear Lake in center. \\"The three sets of experimental results presented all support a through-flow rate in Herman Pit. Even though it is known that water from Herman Pit is flowing into Clear Lake, it cannot be estimated [emphasis added] from these calculations how much is going into the lake or the precise path the flow is taking\\" the study noted. \\"Of the approximate 630 liters per second flowing into and out of Herman Pit, fluid may leave the pit and flow directly into the lake through the waste rock piles, through the native sediment that underlies the waste rock piles, or simply flow elsewhere.\\" wrote S. Geoffrey Schlado, Jordan F. Clark, in the study, Use of Tracers To Quantify Subsurface Flow Through A Mining Pit. Another theory is of geothermal springs being the source for inorganic mercury in Clear Lake, as there are abundant springs emanating from the lake bed. Deep core samples of sediments taken in the 1980s show peaks of mercury during prehistoric times that \\"likely originated from natural processes such as volcanic and/or tectonic activity within the Clear Lake Basin\\" A report published in Geology, November 1987 theorized, \\"that mercury-rich geothermal fluids rose along the activated fractures and faults and were discharged into the lake, causing the anomalously high Hg[Mercury] content of the sediments and leading to deposition of the Sulphur Bank Hg deposit. The total amount of Hg discharged into Clear Lake over the past 15,000 years is estimated to be at least 2,400 metric tons.\\" The EPA-funded research by UC Davis found that total levels of mercury (TotHg) in the lake sediments has \\"not declined significantly a decade after\\" the remediation work in 1992 at Sulphur Bank Mine. Cleanup plans and costs In 2005, the EPA placed a lien on of Bradley-owned property at the mine site to recover cleanup costs estimated at $27 million. Cost estimates for future cleanup go as high as $40 million. Another $1.7 million was agreed upon in a settlement between the EPA and NEC Acquisition Company, the parent company of Earth Energy, Inc., for the costs of re-closing three geothermal wells at Sulphur Bank. The wells were drilled in the 1960s to explore the possibility of geothermal energy production, but of the three test wells at Sulphur Bank, only one was productive and the project was abandoned in the 1980s. Rick Sugarek, project manager for the Superfund site told the Lake County News in 2009 that the EPA has been working with the state on a cleanup plan, but a main sticking point has been the need to run a treatment plant to deal with the water in the Herman Pit. \\"We need to stop that flow, and that's why we need the treatment plant. \\" The question then is where should the water from the pit be discharged? There is no good answer to that, he said. \\"One of the options was piping the water to The Geysers for injection.\\" Sugarek added, \\" there are legal and technical problems with that plan.\\" The total cost estimates to build a treatment plant and remove all of the mine waste could run between $30 million and $40 million. The Geysers are already receiving treated wastewater from both Lake County and Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County. A review paper dated Fall 2008 on the Sulphur Bank Mine site remediation, authored by J. Lessl, University of Florida, Department of Soil and Water Sciences suggests phytoremediation, which is the use of both wild and genetically modified plants to take up (hyper-accumulate) and bank the mercury and arsenic in the plant tissue. The plants have been genetically altered for this specific purpose. The report also suggests the less expensive option of adding soil amendments like compost, lime and fertilizer. \\"This technology relies on the intrinsic ability of organic matter to bind metals, reducing their bioavailability and subsequently allowing vegetation to become established\\" which would ideally, \\"impede the spread of water erosion and reduce water ingress and subsequent metal leaching.\\" The suggestions in the review paper are based on several studies, two of which are; Remediation of metal polluted mine soil with compost: Co-composting versus incorporation by Susan Tandy, 2008, and Phytoremediation of toxic elemental and organic pollutants by Richard B. Meager, 2000. =2009 Recovery Act= The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act was passed by the US Congress in February 2009 and provides $600 million for hazardous waste cleanup, with $5 million of that going to Sulphur Bank Mine and access road work. The funds will pay for the remediation on BIA 120, the road to the Elem Indian Colony adjacent to the mercury mine property. The Bureau of Indian Affairs built BIA 120 using Sulphur Bank mine tailings in the 1970s. The mine tailings and waste rock, in addition to being used for road and house construction in the Elem Indian Colony, was also used by the company Aggrelite in the 1950s. The company operated a concrete block plant at Sulphur Bank Mine and used the tailings to produce 27 different bricks of varying colors and size. The state Division of Mines report of 1953 described the operation, \\"Mine dump material, ... is crushed and screened to minus one-half inch and mixed with one-third part of furnace calcines from the dump below the quicksilver plant ... Plant capacity is 2000 bricks per 8-hour shift. The finished product is used locally and trucked to the San Francisco Bay area.\\" People Between its rise as a geological wonder and its fall from grace as an EPA superfund site, the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine was able to attract admirers that reads like a Who’s Who of California History. =John Veatch= left The first was John Allen Veatch, physician, land surveyor and mineralogist who gave the Sulphur Bank its name in 1856, while on a quest for a domestic supply of borax. Veatch had arrived in California at the time of the 1849 California Gold Rush, became a corresponding member of the California Academy of Sciences and established the first borax mine in the United States. “In due time, I again reached the “white hill,” Veatch wrote in a letter that now serves as a history of discovering the Sulphur Bank and Borax Lake. \\"I now discovered, for the first time, that the “white hill” was mostly a mass of sulphur fused by volcanic heat. The external crust, composed of sulphur mixed with sand and earthy impurities, formed a concrete covering of a whitish appearance, hiding the true nature of the mass beneath.\\" “On breaking the crust, numerous fissures and small cavities lined with sulphur crystals of great beauty were brought to light. Through the fissures, which seemed to communicate with the depth below, hot aqueous vapors and sulphurous fumes constantly escaped,\\" Veatch wrote in his letter to the California Borax Company, dated 1857. =Chinese mine workers= State Mining Bureau 1903 photo of the open pit and tunnel of the \\"western cut\\" at Sulphur Bank Mine The 1880 Census indicates more than 218 Chinese mine workers at Sulphur Bank Mine. The use of Chinese labor in the underground workings was pervasive in the mines of California. Hostility towards the Chinese was also pervasive. Workingmen in California viewed the Chinese as unfair competition. The mine owners could hire four Chinese workers for the price of one white miner. The going price in that era was typically $4 per day for a white miner versus $1 per day for a Chinese man. Local legend suggests that some Chinese miners were killed at the Sulphur Bank mine when hot springs flooded the mining chambers, scalding the workers. At least one cave-in did occur in October 1881, A New York Times report of the incident alludes to loss of life, but those who died in the accident were not Chinese; The five miners were all of Cornwall, England. The issue came to a head on Feb 13 1880. The California Legislature amended the state constitution, adding sections forbidding the Chinese from working for wages. The law also threatened the corporate charter of any industry that did not comply. Most of the mine owners discharged their Chinese workers, but Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mining Company did not. Tiburcio Parrott was arrested Feb. 22 after he gave notice to the California Attorney General A.L. Hart that the company would not comply. He asserted that \\"he would not be dictated to by any man, or set of men, excepting due process of law.\\" Tiburcio Parrott then sued California in the federal Ninth Circuit District court seeking a writ of habeas corpus: California had unconstitutionally deprived him of his liberty. Parrot won. In a decision issued March 22, 1880, the court ruled California could only revoke a corporate charter for threatening public health or morals. Additionally the court ruled only the federal government could sign or revoke an international treaty. The Burlingame Treaty of 1868 was then in force and assured unlimited immigration of Chinese to America and Americans to China. This treaty included the right to work, the court ruled. Tiburcio Parrott gained his freedom and the Sulphur Bank miners maintained their employment. The situation was more enigmatic at the Great Western mercury mine south of Middletown, also in Lake County. Hundreds of Chinese men in the June census were listed as laborers, noting no association with mining. “I had to discharge all my Chinese,” wrote Andrew Rocca, superintendent of the Great Western Mine in a letter dated February 14, 1880. His daughter, Helen Rocca Goss, wrote that the Great Western Quicksilver Mine employed 25 white miners and about 200 Chinese, a number consistent with numbers at Sulphur Bank. Parrott’s court victory was not popular among the populace nor even in the US Congress, and the Chinese question continued at least until the start of the 20th century. Geology When geologist George F. Becker explored the Sulphur Bank Mercury Mine in 1887, the odor of hydrogen sulfide was prominent. Diagram of Hermann mine shaft, 1903 \\"The labyrinth of deep, open pits and trenches, and the acrid dust and evil smells of the locality produce a strong impression on the observer; but even to the geologist, it is an interesting rather than an agreeable one,\\" Becker reported. He found many interesting things about the mine and made the site world-famous after the Encyclopædia Britannica quoted a synopsis of his theory, mentioning Sulphur Bank specifically in the entry on cinnabar. Becker, a professor at the University of California, authored The Geology of the Quicksilver Resources of the Pacific Slope, published in 1888 by the United States Geographical Survey. At the time the mine was explored by Becker in 1887, the Sulphur Bank Quicksilver Mining Company had gone into bankruptcy after a decade of being one of the highest producing mines in California. The mine closed in 1883. By the time of the closure it had some shallow open pits and three shafts: The Hermann, The Fiedler and the Parrott. The Hermann and the Fiedler were connected underground, he wrote, and the Fiedler was flooded and overflowing into Clear Lake. Parrott Shaft was named for the mine's principal owners, Tiburcio and John Parrott. Ferdinand Fiedler was the mine superintendent; the naming of the Hermann shaft is lost to history. The spelling also changed to Herman sometime in the 1920s. =Oxland theory= Becker sought out the mine to test the theory of Robert Oxland, a physician and mineralogist, formerly on the staff of the Toland Medical College in San Francisco, California who also held a patent for refining tungsten from tin ore. Oxland believed the cinnabar ore at Sulphur Bank had been formed from hot springs. His thesis stated that hot springs brought metals in a dissolved state from igneous rock deep in the earth through a thick block of metamorphised ancient seabed to form cinnabar ore near the surface of the mine. Oxland also believed the cinnabar deposit was continually forming. Rocks at the southeast shore of Hermann pit Becker came to agree with the Oxland thesis. There were a number of mysteries about the Sulphur Bank that Becker attempted to solve. Among them was how sulfur had been delivered to the surface of the mine and why the sulfuric acid, created by oxidation and water had not dissolved the quicksilver deposited in the crevices of a layer of basalt near the surface. Becker concluded the sulfur of Sulphur Bank was deposited after the cinnabar had been deposited, because he could find no evidence of acid farther than below the surface of the mine. He wrote the acid would have thrown the cinnabar down, instead of migrating up with the sulfur through the basalt rock which covered the mine site. But Becker was mystified when the water of the flooded shaft was tested and it contained no quicksilver: \\"The absence of mercury from these waters was not a little perplexing,\\" he wrote. He compared Sulphur Bank to similar geology in hot springs at Steamboat Springs, Nevada, which did contain mercury in solution. Becker theorized the ammonia in the water at Sulphur Bank precluded the mercury from the water. =Hot springs= A century after Becker and Oxland, geologists now believe a large magma body in diameter and below ground underlies much of southern Lake County, feeding the Geysers geothermal field in the Mayacmas Mountains, Sulphur Bank and many, if not all, of the abandoned mercury mines in Napa and Lake counties. All of the historically producing mercury mines of the vicinity were associated with mineral or hot springs and all were near the heads of creeks. Among them: Sulphur Bank and the Abbott- Turkey Run mine complexes in the Cache Creek watershed, and the Redington, Manhattan, Oat Hill and the greaern mines in the Putah Creek watershed. \\"It is evident that the water depositing this sinter is closely analogous to that of Sulphur Bank. This is an important fact when considered in connection with other phenomena and will be referred to again,\\" Becker wrote of the abandoned Manhattan mercury mine in northern Napa County, about southeast of the Sulphur Bank mine: \\"Accompanying the cinnabar is free gold, which may be found by panning the soil.\\" Stibnite specimen from the McLaughlin Mine =McLaughlin Mine= That statement got the attention of mining geologist Donald Gustafson of Homestake Mining Company in the late 1970s. Becker's observations had been somewhat obscured by the passage of time but that changed when James William Wilder, who bought the old mine from the Knox estate in 1965, showed Gustafson a copy of Becker's 1888 book. Between 1985 and 2002 Homestake's McLaughlin Mine recovered about 3.4 million ounces of gold, worth roughly $1 billion at an average market price of $300 per ounce, from the site of the Manhattan and Redington mines. This was the largest gold discovery of the 20th century in California, and is a classic example of a hot springs-type epithermal precious metals system.McLaughlin Mine Geology Most of the gold was microscopic, but some fine examples of banded chalcedony veinlets were recovered—see photos at link.McLaughlin gold The heat source for the gold-bearing hot springs was the young (2.2 million years) Clear Lake Volcanic Field.Geology of the McLaughlin Deposit See the geology report for many nice photos of the host rocks, mineralization, and other geologic features. The site is now the Sylvia and Donald McLaughlin Ecological Preserve, managed by University of California, Davis. Among the research projects at the Preserve are whether wetlands can be used to filter heavy metals left from mining activities. McLaughlin maintains the legacy of the only producing gold mine in northern Coastal Range mountains. The McLaughlin Mine enjoyed a reputation as one of the most ecologically sensitive gold mining operations in the world.Homestake shows how good a mine can be, High Country News, January 19, 1998 Nevertheless, during its last year of operation in 2002, the mine emitted 32,396 pounds of mercury into the environment. It was the largest industrial mercury emitter in California that year. =Mercury and hot springs= The Environmental Protection Agency has exclusively focused on mining activity at Sulphur Bank as the source of mercury contamination of Clear Lake. This is also the case with the Carson River contamination, which is focused on mercury lost in the environment through gold and silver mining operations. But other researchers have begun to suspect geothermal hot springs may play a larger role in mercury contamination than previously believed. \\"Ron ( Churchill - California Division of Mines and Geology ) said that the study shows that even prior to mining activity, weathering and erosion of the naturally elevated mercury soils at these sites would have been contributing mercury to the watershed,\\" read the minutes of a 2004 symposium regarding mercury contamination of Cache Creek. \\"Natural hot springs contribute significant inorganic Hg loading to Cache Creek, which transports this loading downstream to the Bay-Delta. Physical, chemical and/or biological processes present at mining sites and/or natural geothermal spring sites methylate Hg locally and transport this bioavailable Hg downstream into Cache Creek.\\" Mercury is associated with the hot springs and geysers of Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, the city of Calistoga in Napa County, California, and the Mayacamas geysers of Sonoma and Lake counties. Researchers from the University of California, Davis, studying the mine through grants from the EPA, could find no trace of mercury in the acidic pond now known as the Herman Pit: A parallel to Becker's 1887 observation.

He assumed office on April 28, 2004. He told the president in a resignation letter dated May 13, 2006 that he had accomplished what he had set out to do, and it was time to pursue other opportunities. Simonson joined HHS in August 2001 and was instrumental in building the HHS preparedness and response organization that grew out of the September 11th attacks. Simonson served as the Secretary's principal advisor on matters related to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies. He also coordinated interagency activities between HHS, other federal departments, agencies, offices and state and local officials responsible for emergency preparedness and the protection of the civilian population.\\"HHS Assistant Secretary's Biography at hhs.gov\\"  History  Simonson is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1986 and Juris Doctor degree in 1994. He is a member of the bar in Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. After completing undergraduate studies, Simonson worked for several years on Wall Street before returning to Wisconsin to pursue a law degree. Simonson worked his way through law school at the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. Upon graduation he was hired as Deputy Counsel to the Governor, and was soon promoted to Legal Counsel to Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a post he held from 1995 to 1999. Under Thompson, Simonson served as Chair of the state Pardon Advisory Board, directed the Governor's emergency management efforts, directed the policy development for crime and corrections, and coordinated the state's public safety agencies. When Thompson became chairman of the board at the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak) in the late 1990s, the Board of Directors appointed Simonson as corporate secretary and counsel for the company. Then, when Thompson was appointed to be Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary, he brought Simonson with him to that agency as well. From 2001 to 2003 he was the HHS Deputy General Counsel and provided legal advice and counsel to the Secretary on public health preparedness matters.\\"Assistant Secretary Appointment at hhs.gov\\"] Simonson also served as Special Counsel to the Secretary and acted as the Secretary's liaison to the Homeland Security Council and the Department of Homeland Security. He also supervised policy development for countermeasure research and development programs, including Project Bioshield, a program to speed the manufacture of vaccines and antidotes. Since its enactment in July 2004, Project BioShield has launched nine acquisition programs including medical countermeasure acquisition programs for all four threat agents (anthrax, smallpox, botulinum toxins, and radiological/nuclear threats) determined by the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to pose material threats to the national security of the United States. Of the $3.4 billion available to the program between FY04 and FY08, over $1.7 billion had been obligated and the Strategic National Stockpile has substantially increased its holding of anthrax vaccines and medical countermeasures for radiological/nuclear threats. Simonson was awarded the Surgeon General's Medallion in May 2006 for \\"Significant Collaboration with and Contributions to the USPHS Commissioned Corps Response Mission.\\" In June 2006, Simonson received the Public Health Achievement Award from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research: \\"For Tireless and exceptional dedication in better preparing our nation and world against the threats of bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases, including pandemic influenza.\\" On May 10, 2006 the Director-General of WHO Dr. J.W. Lee wrote: \\"I want to add my personal congratulations for the contributions you have made to international public health since your appointment as Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness. I will be sorry to see you leave. Your personal interest in pandemic influenza has added much to our joint global preparedness and response and response activities. And without your input and actions, the new and critical International Health Regulations likely would be less robust and action-oriented. Action rather than mere words has been the hallmark of your tenure in the Department of Health and Human Services.\\"  Controversies  Simonson's alleged lack of qualifications and of public health experience were a target for Democrats attacking President Bush's perceived cronyism, especially in light of the poor job Bush-appointee Michael D. Brown is believed to have done responding to Hurricane Katrina. Unlike Mr. Brown, Mr. Simonson, 42 years old, kept his job, and remained at HHS under Mr. Thompson's successor, Mike Leavitt. Some respected public health officials rose to his defense, describing Mr. Simonson as a person who worked behind the scenes to get funding and political support for long-neglected public-health initiatives. Simonson coordinated the HHS response to Hurricane Katrina and received high marks. Dr. Louis Cataldie, the Louisiana State Medical Examiner, wrote in his recently released book, Coroners Journal: \\"I respect Stewart Simonson, Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services, who met me face-to-face and stayed true to his word. Imagine someone from D.C. being a straight guy. He has delivered every time - not so with some of these other cover-your-ass feds.\\" (Cataldie, Louis, Coroner's Journal, G. Putnam's Sons, New York, NY (2006) Page 7.) Some of the nation's leading scientists were quick to defend Simonson. Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota said: \\"Of all the people I've worked with over my career, no one is more competent\\". \\"Here's the guy who has really done a terrific job under very complicated, adverse circumstances. To have him be the target the way he has, has got to be one of the really unfair events in Washington, which is a pretty unfair place to begin with,\\" said Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, an HHS unit (Wall Street Journal, December 12, 2005). D. A. Henderson, a public health expert who led the effort to wipe out smallpox in the late 1960s and 1970s, said: \\"The general feeling was this is someone who may be here because of political reasons, but this is a dedicated person who has the interests of the country at heart.\\" Dr. Henderson, who joined HHS after September 11, 2001, and left in 2002, says Mr. Simonson was instrumental in helping him do everything from finding office space to working on an early HHS purchase of smallpox vaccine (Wall Street Journal, December 12, 2005). In his recent book, Dr. Henderson described Simonson's role in launching the post-9/11 public health preparedness program at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services: \\"Another important figure was Stewart Simonson, special counsel and long-time confidante of the secretary. He was comparatively young and new to government but a quick learner and determined to allow neither bureaucracy nor red tape to stand in the way of getting the job done. Little would have been achieved without both of them\\" (referring to Simonson and Dr. William Raub) D. A. Henderson, MD, Smallpox: The Death of a Disease, Prometheus Books (2009), Page 191.

There are a manifold of variations and techniques used in the application of stone massage therapy, deriving from a variety of traditional practices. Stone massages are primarily used to alleviate physical pain issues, however, are also used to promote emotional and spiritual wellbeing in practice. Origin and History Stone massage and similar practices involving the placement of objects of different temperatures have been dated back to ancient civilisations as a form of healing and therapy. Cultures including native American, Hawaiian and many South Pacific nations have practiced similar methods of ritual and technique to provide physical and spiritual ease. The traditional Hawaiian healing massage ‘Lomilomi’ involves the use of warmed Lomi stones in order to increase areas of blood flow in the body and provide a healing. Similar practices in China have also dated back 2000 years involving the use of heated stones to stimulate improved internal organ function. Such traditional practices have evolved and influenced the application of modern stone massage practices. The re-emergence of such stone massage techniques was seen in 1993 by Mary Nelson with the development of a form of massage utilising hot and cold stones referred to as LaStone Therapy. This form of massage quickly rose to popularity becoming a multi-million dollar industry and has a strong focus on spiritual healing centring around chakras and energy channelling. Many massage therapy parlours providing stone massages offer LaStone Therapy due to its success amongst clients and the established reputable name for the process. These modern forms of stone massage combine techniques utilised in Swedish massage and deep tissue massage. Technique Stone massage therapy using stones on client Volcanic stones, typically basalt are placed in hot water typically at a temperature ranging between 40-60 degrees Celsius (100-140 degrees Fahrenheit) to reach a suitable temperature or placed in chilled water to achieve a chilled stone of -5-25 degrees Celsius 25-75 degrees Fahrenheit) for the practice, the use of a calibrated thermometer is common and recommended to reach the ideal temperatures required. In order to maintain adequate external skin hydration massage oils or lotions are commonly applied to the client’s skin. Sufficient internal hydration is also essential for the treatment due to an increase in body temperature to be experience, which can be achieved through clients consuming water before, during and after a session. A sheet or towel is placed on the client’s skin to provide a barrier between the hot or cold stones and their bare skin, preventing potential burns or discomfort. The stones are then placed on the client according to areas of concern or needing treatment, including the back, legs, arms or feet. Alongside this, the stones are held by the massage therapist and massage into the muscle acting as an extension of their hands. The temperature of the stones are consistently monitored to ensure they remain at a safe and comfortable temperature that will produce the most effective results and enjoyable experience for the client. Controlling the heat of the water in which the stones are warmed or cooled is essential to produce stones at a suitable temperature necessary for the treatment. Some therapists may also perform a Swedish massage prior to the application of stones in order to warm and loosen up the muscles. The duration of stone massages typically range from 60 to 90 minutes depending on the technique used and needs of the client.  Training  In order for an adequate and successful stone massage to take place a professionally trained masseuse needs to conduct the massage. Due to the potential dangers and harms associated with the practice of stone massages, extensive, appropriate training is necessary to carry out a safe, enjoyable experience for the client. It is necessary to gain knowledge of the correct adaption of the practice depending on the needs of the client and methods in which to incorporate stone massages into other massage practices. Certification from professionally recognised massage associations is mandatory to conduct a stone massage in a professional setting. Internationally, to maintain professional standards, stone message therapists are able to obtain Continuing Professional Education (CPE) points which can be achieved through training programmes and courses. With the potential dangers and risks associated with the practice, a manifold of liability insurance options are available for therapists conducting stone massages. It is highly recommended to obtain background knowledge and training in principles of hydrotherapy to safely carry out a stone massage therapy. Training to participate in stone massages focuses significantly on the adaptive approach necessary to conducting this treatment, emphasising the importance of understanding the needs and current condition of the client. Mary Nelson, creator of the modern stone massage through LaStone Therapy recognised the need for high-quality, extensive training and instruction in the field of stone massage. Nelson developed a group of trained therapists to teach and train the practice internationally and produced informational videos to highlight effective methods of the stone massage.  Effectiveness and Benefits  Stone massage therapy is often engaged with for the acknowledged benefits that can be received from taking part in such a process. A primary benefit associated with the practice is that of stimulating blood flow in the circulatory system through the heat and movement of the stones. Stone massages also ease muscle pain and often, the presence of muscle tension and spasms through reducing inflammation and relaxing muscles through a combination of both the heat and movement experience during the practice to access deeper tissues. This method of massage is also commonly recommended for physically sensitive individuals as it allows for a deeper tissue massage without excessive hand treatment from the therapist. Many also engage in the practice due to its relaxational and mental benefits that can be reaped from undertaking a stone massage. The environment and physical effects experienced from a stone massage assist in inducing a state of deep relaxation for many participants, which often improves mental clarity and improves in destressing for many individuals. Alongside this, studies have shown that stone massages and related therapies have assisted in improving sleep quality for individuals. A study conducted at the Urmia University of Medical Science found that basalt hot stone massage therapy “…can successfully contribute in reducing sleep disturbances, improving quality of sleep and enhancing comfort level…”. The study applied five of the specialised stones to the area of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth chakra to stimulate an enhancement of sleep quality. There have also found to benefits received by the massage therapist in conducting a hot stone massage. As the stones carry out the mass of the contact and work with the client, the instance of stresses and strain being experienced by the therapist in the areas of hands, wrists and the upper body are reduced. The occurrence of stress injuries caused by repetitive activity in the fingers and hand are commonly diminished for the therapist.  Dangers and Risk  There are a number of dangers and risks associated with stone massage therapy, particularly due to the presence of high temperatures being exposed to the skin. Improper heating of the stones can lead to a higher potential for burns on the skin caused by unsafe and uneven temperatures of the stones being put on clients. There are also certain risk involved in receiving a stone massage for individuals with specific medical conditions. Medical conditions including diabetes, epilepsy, skin conditions and heart disease and neuropathy pose a contraindication with stone massage as a treatment and have potential for causing harm. Clients with recent skin or shallow abrasions such as cuts, burns, bruising and varicose are advised to avoid stone massages as this therapy has potential to increase further injury or greater concerns such as tissue damage. Such conditions or minor injuries also pose risk for higher chances of infection from bacterial exposure from the stones, massage oils or the masseuse. The impairment subsequent from drug and alcohol use largely impede on the safety and effectiveness of stone massage therapy. The effect of such substances often limit an individual’s judgement and impulsive control, both necessary to actively engage in a stone massage. Participation and contribution from the client are essential in a stone massage due to the risk and uncertainty of reaction from the temperature of the stones, a reaction that could be largely desensitised due to the effects of alcohol or drugs.  Misconceptions of the Practice  There are a manifold of common misconceptions surrounding the practice of stone massage largely derived from graphic and media representations of the practice. Mainstream representation of the massage often involves the stones being directly placed on the clients skin, whilst the real life application of the practice rarely involves this method, instead using a cloth or towel to separate the stones from direct contact with the skin. Many individuals avoid the practice due to fear of burns or pain from this widespread misconception. It is often commonly misconceived that the massage is a set, standard practice and routine that is applied to every client. Professional treatments vary depending on the needs of the client and skills acquired by the therapist to suit the therapy being applied. Representation of the practice commonly shows the stones arranged in an orderly pattern down the centre of the client’s back, tracing the spine. The specialist stones are placed all around the body, commonly avoiding the crevice of the spine, focusing on the areas of concern for the client.  Supply Companies and Industries  As the stone massage utilises equipment and techniques that were new to the massage industry and unfamiliar to practioneers, the rise in demand for the practice evidenced a necessity for specialised equipment and resources. A number of stone supply companies were developed to fulfil the need for greater supplies of the stones required for the practice. Firms such as Desert Stone People, RubRocks and Nature’s Stones Inc became prominent suppliers and distributors of the stones to spas and parlours predominantly across the United States. The development of equipment suited towards heating and cooling the stones was also essential is establishing adequate and safe applications of this process, with products such as the ‘Spa-Pro Massage Stone Heater being designed and distributed.  Notable Media Representation  As the stone massage increased in popularity internationally as a form of therapy and mainstream massage, the practice got incorporated into the media including films, tv shows, advertisement and books. The 2006 movie ‘Big Momma’s House 2’ features a notable scene in which the characters receive a hot stone massage. Children’s film ‘LEGO Movie 2’ also features a scene including a hot stone massage.

Tramping (in Czech and Slovak language) is a movement incorporating woodcraft, hiking/backpacking/camping and scouting, with a characteristic flavour of and styled on American culture, especially the Wild West.\\"Protektorátní školák a jeho volný čas\\" (\\"A Student in the Protectorate and His Free Time\\") The latter is particularly noticeable in the tramping song, a song and musical style associated with tramping. Tramping originated in Czechoslovakia in the beginning of the 20th century and is still present in today's Czech Republic and to a lesser degree in Slovakia. It manifests itself in a distinctive style of clothing, hiking culture and tramping music. For the urban youth it was a specific form of a \\"return to nature\\". A provisional camp of Czech tramps \\"Mrtvé dítě\\" (Dead Kid) in the region Roverky (about 2005-2010)  History  Czech interest in 'Amerika' dates back to the nineteenth century, when Bohemia and Moravia (and most of Central Europe) were provinces of the Austrian Empire. Writings about the United States to Czechs through journalistic and monographic reports by Jan Náprstek and others highlighted to exotic degrees the natural and cultural richness of 'Amerika' (to use the word that Franz Kafka, who was from Prague, used as the title of his 1927 novel). The first community of Czech \\"tramps\\" arose probably in 1918. Having been an original Czech movement, tramping became popular in Slovakia in 1925-1928 The introduction of the worldwide scouting movement to the region roughly coincided with the beginnings of the popularity of the 'western' novelist Karl May, a German, and the formation of the first Czechoslovak Republic. The economic successes of the new nation and its many political and social links to the United States (for example the first Czechoslovak President, Tomáš Masaryk, was married to Charlotte Garrigue, who was from a prominent American family and part of the reason for Masaryk's success in persuading Woodrow Wilson to support the inception of Czechoslovakia) meant that Czechs' interest in things American continued in earnest. Films starring Tom Mix and the 'modernistic' strains of the latest foxtrots and tangos were some of the many cultural imports. Tramping, not to be confused with simple hiking, is a pastime born out of the pressures and opportunities of the interwar period. Saturated with idyllic images of the American West and seeking respite from the pressures of modern urban life, many Czechs set off into the woods. Tramp settlements with names such as Hudson, Little Bighorn and Swanee soon became temporary homes for scores of Czechs impersonating cowboys, Red Indians, forty-niners and other American characters. What began as a weekend pastime gained importance during World War II, when forays into the woods became illegal, though many found them culturally and socially important. American musical expressions such as those that had enlivened interwar tramps' campfire gatherings became more politically potent as well as more uniquely Czech. After the 1948 Communist takeover, tramping's rebellious streak continued and represented a phenomenon of an attractive alternative culture(an \\"internal emigration\\"). The sort of American-type music that thrived as part of this movement was never seriously repressed. The sentimental nature of much of the repertory of tramping songs made them much less objectionable than rock and roll and jazz. The golden age of this movement was in the period of 1930-1990 when the amount of \\"tramps\\" in Czechoslovakia reached 40,000 - 80,000 people. (In a case of non-organized individualistic movement any guess is always speculative.) The Czech and Slovak tramps established several thousand provisional settlements (\\"osada\\") - mostly around big cities (Prague, Bratislava, Plzeň, Ostrava, Brno)- with elements of a specific architecture (wooden cabins, fireplaces, totems etc.) imitating the Wild West.

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks President Bush nominated Brown to become deputy director of FEMA. Brown currently hosts a radio talk show on 850 KOA in Denver, Colorado.630 KHOW Early life Brown was born on November 8, 1954 in Guymon, Oklahoma, the son of Eloise (Ferguson) and Wayne Ellsworth Brown. He received a B.A. in public administration/political science from the Central State University (now the University of Central Oklahoma). He received his J.D. from Oklahoma City University School of Law in 1981. While he was in college, from 1975 to 1978, he handled \\"labor and budget matters\\"\\"Enid Attorney Hopes to Unseat English\\", The Oklahoman, October 16, 1988 as an assistant to the city manager of Edmond, Oklahoma (1980 population of 34,637). His White House biography stated that he had emergency services oversight in this position. However, the head of public relations for the city was quoted as denying that Brown had oversight over anybody and that \\"the assistant is more like an intern.\\" She said, \\"Mike used to handle a lot of details. Every now and again I'd ask him to write me a speech. He was very loyal. He was always on time. He always had on a suit and a starched white shirt.\\" However, Claudia Deakins, the spokesperson for the City of Edmond, submitted information to the House Committee investigating Hurricane Katrina that Time Magazine, which described his resume as \\"padded,\\" had taken her quotes out of context, and erroneously reported Brown's position at the City of Edmond. The former Mayor of Edmond, Carl Reherman, and the former City Attorney, Mary Ann Karns, each submitted affidavitsHouse.gov to the House investigating committee showing that Brown did have emergency management experience. While attending law school, Brown was appointed by the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee of the Oklahoma Legislature as the Finance Committee Staff Director, where he oversaw state fiscal issues from 1980–1982. In 1981, he was elected to the city council for Edmond, but resigned to work in private practice. Law career Later in the 1980s Brown lived in Enid, Oklahoma and practiced law there. During the Hurricane Katrina controversy, Stephen Jones, the senior partner and founder of the firm for which Brown worked, described him as \\"not serious and somewhat shallow\\" and stated that he had handled \\"transactional,\\" rather than litigation work. Brown later went into solo practice. He also taught at Oklahoma City University law school as an adjunct lecturer - although his FindLaw profile falsely misrepresented his occupation at that time as an \\"Outstanding Political Science Professor\\". From 1982–1988, he was the Chairman of the Board of the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority. Brown ran for Congress in 1988 against Democratic incumbent Glenn English, who had not been challenged in the previous election. English's well-financed campaign soundly defeated Brown with 122,763 votes against 45,199. After losing, Brown promised to try again in 1990, saying, \\"I have an excellent chance of prevailing. It's a Democratic state, but a very Republican district.\\"\\"6th District Returns English to Congress,\\" The Oklahoman, November 9, 1988 However, Brown did not run in 1990, and English beat his Republican opponent, Robert Burns, 110,100 votes to 27,540. IAHA tenure Before joining FEMA, Brown was the Judges and Stewards Commissioner for the International Arabian Horse Association from 1989-2001. After numerous lawsuits were filed against the organization over disciplinary actions that Brown took against members violating the association's code of ethics, from the NHAHA Brown resigned and negotiated a buy-out of his contract. A March 2000 two-part report in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, chronicling one of the disciplinary actions, lauded Brown for pursuing an investigation against David Boggs, \\"the kingpin of the Arabian horse world\\", despite internal pressure to end the inquiry. The Brown-led investigation found Boggs performed medically unnecessary surgery on horses to enhance their visual appeal. An ethics board suspended Boggs for five years. Boggs protested through multiple lawsuits against both the organization and Brown, alleging slander and defamation. Brown and the International Arabian Horse Association prevailed in each of the lawsuits brought by Boggs but the lawsuits nonetheless took a financial toll. Some members interviewed felt Brown showed an imperious attitude, and nicknamed him \\"The Czar.\\" Brown started his own legal defense fund before resigning, a move he said was necessary to protect his family's assets., Arabian Horse World, November 2000 However, some insiders claimed that this was what really led to his ousting. He raised money from breeders for the fund as well as the International Arabian Horse Association, creating what some called a conflict of interest. Despite his contract stipulating that association was to pay all his personal legal expenses, on top of his $100,000 annual salary, the association initially refused to pay the legal bills. It was claimed that Brown created the legal defense fund on the advice of the association's own legal counsel. Bush administration service After President Bush entered office in January 2001, Brown joined FEMA as general counsel. He was the first person hired by his long-time friend, FEMA director Joe Allbaugh, who also ran Bush's election campaign in 2000. Allbaugh later named Brown his acting deputy director in September 2001. Bush formally nominated him as deputy director on March 22, 2002, and the Senate confirmed him many months later after the September 11 attacks recovery effort in New York had subsided. Brown oversaw the recovery efforts for New York and surrounding states with the White House Office of Domestic Policy's Reuben Jeffery III who later became chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Prior to his nomination as undersecretary, the White House appointed Brown to head a transition team creating the Emergency Preparedness & Response Directorate within Department of Homeland Security. Before that, shortly after the September 11 attacks, Brown served on the Consequence Management Principals' Committee, which acted as the White House's policy coordination group for the federal domestic response to the attacks. Later, Bush asked him to head the Consequence Management Working Group to identify and resolve key issues regarding the federal response plan. In August 2002, Bush appointed Brown to the Transition Planning Office for the new Department of Homeland Security, serving as the transition leader for the Emergency Preparedness and Response Division. As undersecretary, Brown also directed the National Incident Management System Integration Center, the National Disaster Medical System and the Nuclear Incident Response Team. After Bush announced the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, Allbaugh left government and Bush nominated Brown in January 2003 for the directorship of FEMA. Brown was sworn into his position on April 15, 2003. On August 31, 2005, following Hurricane Katrina being named an \\"Incident of National Significance\\", Brown was named the Principal Federal Official and placed in charge of the federal government's response by Homeland Security Director Michael Chertoff. On September 7, 2005, Coast Guard Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Thad Allen was named Brown's deputy and given operational control of search and rescue and recovery efforts.Coast Guard's Chief of Staff To Assist FEMA Head Brown, The Washington Post, September 7, 2005 At the Mobile (Alabama) Regional Airport on September 2, 2005, President Bush, who had appointed Brown in 2003, praised him shortly after the storm hit, saying \\"Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job.\\" On September 9, 2005, Chertoff relieved Brown of all on-site relief duties along the Gulf Coast, officially replacing him with Vice Admiral Allen. Brown remained undersecretary of Emergency Preparedness and Response. Brown told the Associated Press that \\"the press\\" was making him a scapegoat for the slow federal response to the hurricane. Chertoff granted Brown two 30-day contract extensions in order not to \\"sacrifice the real ability to get a full picture of Mike's experiences.\\" Brown continued to receive his $148,000 annual salary until November 2, 2005, when he left in the middle of the second 30-day extension. =Resignation from FEMA= On September 12, 2005, in the wake of what was widely believed to be incompetent handling of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by state, local and federal officials, Brown resigned, saying that it was \\"in the best interest of the agency and best interest of the president.\\" Overall, at least 1,245 people had died in the hurricane and subsequent floods. Brown's standing had also been damaged when the Boston Herald revealed his meager experience in disaster management before joining FEMA. Shortly after his resignation the Associated Press obtained a videotape of Brown briefing Bush, Governor Blanco, Mayor Nagin and others in which he questioned the wisdom of the Mayor's use of the Louisiana Superdome as a \\"shelter of last resort\\" and questioning the structural integrity of the Superdome. By the time he resigned from FEMA, Brown had already been discharged from his functions as local coordinator by Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and was sent back to Washington to continue FEMA's central operations. At least one source, The Economist, suggested that Brown had been \\"pushed\\" out by the administration rather than having resigned voluntarily, although internal e-mails from Brown indicated that he was already planning to leave FEMA at the time Katrina hit. The same suggestion was made by at least one member of Congress during a hearing on what went wrong during Katrina. Brown concentrated his testimony at that hearing on alleging that Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco and New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin bore most, if not all, of the blame for the failures in the response to Katrina, and that his only fault had been not to realize sooner their inability to perform their respective duties. On November 2, 2005, Brown ended his contract early (it had been extended to mid-November by Chertoff) and left the federal government. On January 18, 2006, Brown stated that certain things could have been handled differently, such as calling in the military. As one of the largest natural disasters to ever strike the U.S., he stated, \\"It was beyond the capacity of the state and local governments, and it was beyond the capacity of FEMA.\\" On February 10, 2006, Brown again testified before Congress, this time placing blame on the Department of Homeland Security for the poor handling of the disaster, asserting that the anti- terrorism focus of the department had caused it to deny resources needed to properly operate FEMA. In his February 2006 testimony, Brown also contradicted earlier claims that the White House was unaware of levees having been breached, stating: \\"For them to claim that we didn't have awareness of it is just baloney.\\" On March 1, 2006, AP released a recording of Brown and Bush in a video conference in which the vulnerability of the levee system was raised with a great deal of concern over potential loss of life. Bush denied any awareness of the possibility of a levee-related catastrophe in an interview. Post-FEMA activities =Work for InferX Company= Brown began as an adviser to a publicly traded company, InferX which claimed its technology is the answer to US security concerns, as well as the credibility problems of the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency. Brown had been on the media circuit talking about technology that claims to screen for terror suspects, track threats in shipping containers and cargo hauling, and gather data for law enforcement tracking. In December 2007, Brown was named CEO of InferX and then appointed to the board of directors in April 2008. As of May 9, 2008 Brown and others left the company pending sale of InferX to another investor. =Work for Cotton Companies= , Brown worked for Cotton Companies, a private firm specializing in disaster recovery. Throughout 2007 and early 2008 Brown made appearances to the press on behalf of Cotton companies. In these appearances, he referred to the lessons that he had learned from his experiences as the head of FEMA during Hurricane Katrina.Cotton companies press releases =Next of Kin Registry NOKR= In July 2009, Brown became the CEO of the Next of Kin Registry, an NGO in Washington DC. NOKR is a central depository for Emergency Contact information in the United States plus 87 other countries. The NGO is all volunteer driven.Next of Kin Registry \\"NOKR Volunteer Staff and Volunteer Advisors\\" site bios including Brown =Work for Cold Creek Solutions= On August 28, 2009, it was announced via press release emailsDaily Kos: State of the Nation: Michael Brown Offers Consulting Practice for Disaster RecoveryThe Furman Files: Michael Brown Consulting on Disaster Planning \\"Former FEMA Director Michael Brown Joins Cold Creek Solutions, Offers Consulting Practice for Disaster Recovery\\" and also subsequently reportedSun System News: Former FEMA Director Joins Cold Creek SolutionsDenver Business Journal:Ex-FEMA chief Brown joins Cold Creek Solutions that Brown had joined Cold Creek Solutions as VP, Disaster Recovery Practice. =Radio talk show host= Brown filled in at various times on Denver radio station KOA after leaving government service. In February 2010 he was named the host of the Michael Brown Show from 7-10 pm weeknights on KOA, when not preempted by sports. Brown has embraced the criticism received during his handling of FEMA and has indicated that this gives him insight into when government fails. In mid-2012 Brown teamed up with Denver liberal KKZN host David Sirota for KHOW's Sirota-Brown show for KHOW's afternoon drive slot, but now hosts his own show, again called the Michael Brown Show. Politically, on the program, Brown describes himself as \\"very clearly center-right, conservative, with a strong libertarian bent.\\" During the COVID-19 outbreak, Brown questioned whether wearing masks would stop the spread of the virus and said that he would not take a COVID vaccine. =Author= Brown co-authored a book, Deadly Indifference: The Perfect (Political) Storm: Hurricane Katrina, The Bush White House, and Beyond, about his experiences during Hurricane Katrina. The book was released June 16, 2011 and is published by Taylor Trade Publishing. Brown criticizes the performance of numerous people, including Bush, Trent Lott, Dennis Hastert, Ray Nagin, and Jesse Jackson, and critiques his own performance by stating that he failed to be ready for the press and was too timid in his response. FEMA controversies and criticism =Hurricane Frances= In 2004, FEMA disbursed $30 million in disaster relief funds for Hurricane Frances to residents of Miami, Florida, where damage from Hurricane Frances was minimal. Brown admitted to $12 million in overpayments, but denied any serious mistakes, blaming a computer glitch. After investigating, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrote that Brown was responsible and called for him to be fired., South Florida Sun-Sentinel, September 8, 2005 In January 2005, U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler (D-FL) publicly urged Bush to fire Brown, citing the Sun-Sentinel 's report., January 24, 2005 Wexler repeated his call in April to Chertoff, citing new reports that FEMA sent inspectors with criminal records of robbery and embezzlement to do damage assessments., April 27, 2005 =Hurricane Katrina= In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, many Democratic politicians called for Brown to be fired immediately, including California Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, New York Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, Colorado Senator Ken Salazar, Michigan Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick and Senator Debbie Stabenow, Louisiana State Rep. Peter Sullivan, Nevada Senator Harry Reid, Delaware Senator Joe Biden, and Illinois Senator Dick Durbin. added graffiti to their trashed appliances set on curbs to be hauled away. Here a refrigerator inscription satirizes Bush's \\"Heck of a job\\" praise for Brown. Republican politicians such as Senator Trent Lott have also criticized Brown's leadership of FEMA. Brown's performance was defended, however, by Republicans such as former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former Presidential speechwriter Pat Buchanan. \\"Heck of a job\\" soon became sarcastic slang for things done by politically connected cronies or general incompetence.Heck of a Job, Wolfie Truthdig.com, April 17, 2007 On August 29, 2005, five hours after the hurricane hit land, Brown made his first request for Homeland Security rescue workers to be deployed to the disaster area only after two days of training.Memo from Michael Brown to Michael Chertoff, August 29, 2005 He also told fire and rescue departments outside affected areas to refrain from providing trucks or emergency workers without a direct appeal from state or local governments in order to avoid coordination problems and the accusation of overstepping federal authority. On September 1, 2005, Brown told Soledad O'Brien of CNN that he was unaware that New Orleans' officials had housed thousands of evacuees, who quickly ran out of food and water, in the Convention Center—even though major news outlets had been reporting on the evacuees' plight for at least a day. He also criticized those that were stuck in New Orleans as those \\"who chose not to evacuate, who chose not to leave the city\\" (disobeying a mandatory evacuation order). On September 2, 2005, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley stated that he pledged firefighters, police officers, health department workers, and other resources on behalf of the city, but was only asked to send one tank truck. Gail Collins, at the time editor of The New York Times editorial page, called Brown \\"legendary as a disaster in his own right\\", and on Thanksgiving week in 2005, Brown was No. 1 on CNN's \\"Political Turkey of the Year\\" list for his handling of Katrina. On August 28, 2007, Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards proposed what he called \\"Brownie's Law\\" requiring that \\"qualified people, not political hacks\\", lead key federal agencies.Edwards wants law against \\"Brownies\\", Reuters August 28, 2007 =E-mails= Brown's email messages were requested by a congressional house committee in November 2005 to investigate the federal government's handling of the Katrina disaster. Controversy arose when the approximately 1,000 e-mail messages between Brown, staff and acquaintances were released. Several of Brown's emails display an arguable lack of professionalism in his duties (per Charlie Melancon, the representative from this congressional district at the time). On the day Katrina struck, Brown wrote \\"Can I quit now? Can I go home?\\" He later quipped to a friend on September 2 that he could not meet her because he was \\"trapped [as FEMA head] ... please rescue me.\\"; and at another time \\"If you'll look at my lovely FEMA attire, you'll really vomit. I am a fashion god.\\"Michael Brown E-mails In another e-mail, Brown's press secretary, Sharon Worthy, advised him to roll up his sleeves \\"to look more hard-working... Even the president rolled his sleeves to just below the elbow.\\" An e-mail offering critical medical equipment went unanswered for four days. Brown criticism of the Obama administration =Deepwater Horizon oil spill= Brown speaking about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in May 2010 declared: \\"This is exactly what they want, because now he can pander to the environmentalists and say, 'I'm gonna shut it down because it's too dangerous,'\\" ... \\"This president has never supported big oil, he's never supported offshore drilling, and now he has an excuse to shut it back down.\\" =Hurricane Sandy= Brown criticized President Obama for responding to Hurricane Sandy faster than he responded to the attacks at Benghazi. He also stated that he thought that President Obama was overplaying the likely threat from Sandy, and that the storm had hardly formed. He also noted \\"The storm was still forming, people were debating whether it was going to be as bad as expected, or not, and I noted that the president should have let the governors and mayors deal with the storm until it got closer to hitting the coastal areas along the Washington, D.C.-New York City corridor.\\" In an interview with Denver Westword, Brown said: \\"One thing [President Obama's] gonna be asked is, why did he jump on [Hurricane Sandy] so quickly and go back to D.C. so quickly when in ... Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? Why was this so quick? ... At some point, somebody's going to ask that question.\\" See also * Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina References External links * How Reliable Is Brown's Résumé?, TIME Online Edition, September 8, 2005 * Mike Brown's padded résumé, The New Republic, September 8, 2005 * White House biography of Brown  Michael Brown's campaign contributions from Newsmeat * Michael Brown e-mails during Katrina  John Humphrey Interviews Michael Brown, May 8, 2007 Category:1954 births Category:American libertarians Category:Federal Emergency Management Agency officials Category:George W.

He was a Professor of Physics and Meteorology at the University of Groningen. Coster was born in Amsterdam. On February 26, 1919, he married Lina Maria Wijsman, who held a degree in Oriental languages. Eventually, she was one of the first women to obtain a doctorate degree in this field from the University of Leiden. Dirk and Miep had two sons and two daughters (Hendrik, Ada, Els, and Herman). Coster is known as the co-discoverer of hafnium (element 72) in 1923, along with George de Hevesy, by means of X-ray spectroscopic analysis of zirconium ore. The discovery took place in Copenhagen, Denmark. Its name is derived from Hafnia, the Latin name for Copenhagen. Childhood and education Coster grew up in Amsterdam in a large working-class family; he was the third child of Barend Coster, a blacksmith, and Aafje van der Mik. The Coster family valued education. Ten of their children survived to adulthood and all received enough education to go onto middle-class professions. From 1904 to 1908 Dirk went to the Teacher's College in Haarlem, then was a teacher until 1913. With the aid of private support he was able to study mathematics and physics at the University of Leiden, first having passed the exams required for students who had no gymnasium education. In Leiden he was influenced by the inspiring lectures of Paul Ehrenfest, and in 1916 he obtained his M.Sc. degree. From 1916 to 1920 Coster was assistant of Lodewijk Siertsema and Wander de Haas at the Delft University of Technology, where in 1919 he obtained an Engineer's degree in electrical engineering. In 1920 and 1921 he did research at Lund University under Manne Siegbahn, on X-ray spectroscopy of different elements. Coster's thesis was on this subject, and he obtained his Ph.D. degree in 1922 in Leiden under Paul Ehrenfest; his thesis was entitled \\"Röntgenspectra en de atoomtheorie van Bohr\\" (X-ray spectra and Bohr's atomtheory). Academic career From August 1922 until the summer of 1923, Coster worked in Niels Bohr's Institute in Copenhagen. Within a few months he co-authored a landmark publication with Bohr, on X-ray spectroscopy and the periodic system of the elements. In addition he worked with chemist George de Hevesy on the identification of element No. 72. Element 72 had been known to be a gap in the sequence of elements since 1914, when Henry Moseley created an experimental technique for placing the elements in a definite sequence. Radiochemist Fritz Paneth suggested that element 72 might be found in ores of zirconium. (Some histories incorrectly attribute this suggestion to physicist Niels Bohr.) Bohr published a prediction of the electronic configuration of element 72 in 1923. von Hevesy had been working with Bohr at the time. After Coster returned from Copenhagen he became Hendrik Lorentz' assistant at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, where he developed an X-ray spectrometer. In 1924 he was appointed at the University of Groningen, where he was the successor of Wander de Haas. At Groningen he started an active research program in X-ray spectroscopy. In 1934 Coster became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Later years Coster was politically involved. In 1938 he traveled to Berlin to convince Lise Meitner that she had to leave Germany to escape the persecution of the Jews. Together they went by train to Groningen; at the Dutch border, Coster persuaded German immigration officers that she had permission to travel to the Netherlands. From there she went on to Sweden by way of Copenhagen. During the German occupation of Holland, Coster also helped Jews hide from the Nazis and listened to the BBC on a daily basis using a bicycle-powered radio. He died in Groningen. The asteroid 10445 Coster is named after Dirk Coster.

As of 2013, five books consisting entirely of Heyawake puzzles have been published by Nikoli. It first appeared in Puzzle Communication Nikoli #39 (September 1992). Rules Heyawake is played on a rectangular grid of cells with no standard size; the grid is divided into variously sized rectangular \\"rooms\\" by bold lines following the edges of the cells. Some rooms may contain a single number, typically printed in their upper-left cell; as originally designed, every room was numbered, but this is rarely necessary for solving and is no longer followed. Some of the cells in the puzzle are to be painted black; the object of the puzzle is to determine for each cell if it must be painted or must be left blank (remaining white). In practice, it is often easier to mark known \\"blank\\" cells in some way--for example, by placing a dot in the center of the cell. The following rules determine which cells are which: *Rule 1: Painted cells may never be orthogonally connected (they may not share a side, although they can touch diagonally). *Rule 2: All white cells must be interconnected (form a single polyomino). *Rule 3: A number indicates exactly how many painted cells there must be in that particular room. *Rule 4: A room which has no number may contain any number of painted cells, or none. *Rule 5: Where a straight (orthogonal) line of connected white cells is formed, it must not contain cells from more than two rooms--in other words, any such line of white cells which connects three or more rooms is forbidden. Solution methods Note that the first two rules also apply to (for example) Hitori puzzles, and thus these puzzles share some of their solving methods: *If it is discovered that a cell is painted, it is immediately known that all of the four (orthogonally) adjacent cells must be white (from Rule 1). *A section of (orthogonally) contiguous white cells cannot be cut off from the rest of the grid (from Rule 2). Black cells may not form a diagonal split across the grid nor a closed loop; any cell that would complete such a \\"short circuit\\" must be white instead. More complex puzzles require combining Rule 1 and Rule 2 to make progress without guessing; the key is recognizing where the cells must assume one of two checkered patterns and one leads to a short circuit. The remaining rules differentiate Heyawake from other \\"dynasty\\" puzzles: * Rule 5 is the defining rule of the puzzle; black cells must be placed to prevent any (orthogonal) lines of white cells that cross two room borders (\\"spanners\\"). * Numbered rooms typically provide solvers a starting place, among other deductions. The following are the simplest examples of rooms defined at the onset:  A 2×2 room in the corner of the grid containing a '2' must have one painted cell in the grid corner and the second painted square diagonally outward from the corner. As painted squares may not share a side (Rule 1), the only alternative would disconnect the forced white cell in the corner, violating Rule 2.  A 2×3 room with the 3-cell side along a grid border containing a '3' must have a painted cell in the center of the 3-cell side along the border and the other two in the opposite corners of the room, for similar reasons to the above.  A 1×3 room containing a '2' must have the two end cells painted, as a painted centre cell would force a breach of rule 1. More generally, a 1×(2n−1) room containing an n must have every other cell within it painted.  A 3×3 room containing a '5' must have a checkered pattern, with painted cells in all corners and the center. Variants * Heyawacky is played like Heyawake, but rooms are not necessarily rectangular. Orthogonal lines of white cells may not exit and re-enter a room; i.e. such lines may not straddle more than one region boundary. * Symmetry Heyawake is played like Heyawake, but clues indicate whether the pattern of black cells in a room is rotationally symmetric around its centre or not.  Computational complexity  The computational complexity of Heyawake has been analyzed:M. Holzer, O. Ruepp (2007) deciding for a given instance of Heyawake whether there exists a solution to the puzzle is NP-complete. An interpretation of this theoretical result in layman's terms is that this puzzle is as hard to solve as the Boolean satisfiability problem, which is a well studied difficult problem in computer science.

Biography Waris Habibullah was born in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, British India, into a family of the aristocratic Taluqdar class, and spent his early years mainly in Bombay. He came to the UK with his family in 1946, when his father, Ali Bahadur Habibullah, was appointed to the Indian High Commission. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, his father returned to India, but his mother, Attia Hosain, chose to stay in England with her children, and worked as a writer and as broadcaster on the Indian Section of the BBC's Eastern Service from 1949. He was educated at Clifton College, and then studied English literature at Queens' College, Cambridge, where he directed several plays. His contemporaries included Derek Jacobi, Margaret Drabble, Trevor Nunn, and Ian McKellen, whom he directed in several productions, including a Marlowe Society revival of Caesar and Cleopatra. After graduating in 1960, he joined the BBC to train as a director. He also changed his name from Habibullah to Hussein: > \\"It sounded like the King of Jordan then, but [later] turned out to be more > like Saddam – and that doesn't help in life\\". Hussein directed the first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child, in 1963, although he was unsure about the effect directing television science fiction would have on his career: > \\"[I was] a graduate from Cambridge with honours, and you're directing this > piece about cavemen in skins [..] 'I thought, 'Where have I landed up in my > life?'\\" In 1964, Hussein returned to the series to direct most of the fourth serial, Marco Polo. He went on to direct many other productions such as a BBC television version of A Passage to India (Play of the Month, 1965); the BBC serial Notorious Woman (1974); the suffragette movement BBC drama Shoulder to Shoulder (1974); and the Thames Television serial Edward and Mrs Simpson (1978). During production of the latter two series, he worked once more with former Doctor Who producer Verity Lambert. He also directed for Thames the first story (a four-parter) in the Armchair Thriller series. Hussein's feature film A Touch of Love (1969), with Ian McKellen among the cast, was entered into the 19th Berlin International Film Festival. Other theatrically released films include Melody (1971), also known as S.W.A.L.K, with Jack Wild and Mark Lester, and Henry VIII and his Six Wives (1972), starring Keith Michell, Charlotte Rampling, and Donald Pleasence. In the 1980s and 1990s, Hussein directed several television movies in the United States. One British project was Intimate Contact (1987), a four-part drama for Central TV with Claire Bloom and Daniel Massey, portraying the experience of a couple where the husband has contracted and ultimately dies from AIDS. Although he did not reveal it to anyone on the production at the time, the subject was particularly close one for Hussein, who lost his own partner Ian to the disease. Hussein directed Sixth Happiness (1997), a film whose screenplay was written by Firdaus Kanga, the author of the semi-autobiographical novel Trying to Grow. Meera Syal, Nina Wadia, and Firdaus Kanga starred in the film. In the BBC drama An Adventure in Space and Time (2013), about the creation of Doctor Who, Hussein was portrayed by Sacha Dhawan. Awards Hussein received a Best Drama Series or Serial BAFTA award in 1979 for Edward and Mrs. Simpson (shared with producer Andrew Brown), and an Outstanding Directing in a Variety or Music Program Emmy Award in 1985 for Copacabana. Personal life Hussein has a partner, and he came out to his partner's family by 2017.

Playing career Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Simek played soccer as a child in the United States but did not think of the game as a career until his family moved to London after his father was assigned to a position at the English office of Anheuser-Busch when Frank was 12. He was signed by Arsenal to a development contract, but decided to move back to St. Louis, where he played at Saint Louis University High School, as well as Metro F.C. with teammates (Chris Loftus, Nathan Sabich, Eric Joseph and Adam Lanter.), Then under the direction of Dave Fernandez and Dale Schilly. However, during this time Arsenal called him back to play on the youth team. While at Arsenal he rose to assume the captaincy of the reserve side, but had difficulty breaking into the first team; he found himself behind Lauren, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Eboué and Justin Hoyte in the pecking order. He played a single match for Arsenal, in the League Cup against Wolverhampton Wanderers on December 2, 2003. =Sheffield Wednesday= Simek joined the Owls on a free transfer from Arsenal in the summer of 2005 and made his Sheffield Wednesday debut on the opening day of the 2005–06 season away at Stoke City. He went on to win a regular starting spot, ousting fan-favourite Lee Bullen from his preferred right-back position. Simek scored his first goal in his first season at Wednesday away at Millwall. The goal gave the Owls a 1–0 win and helped them in their battle against relegation. Simek then managed to get his first home goal against Colchester in the 2006–2007. Simek had managed to gain a regular first team place at Hillsborough became a crowd favourite for his tough tackling and powerful running. Simek signed a new contract with Sheffield Wednesday on 26 July 2007. The contract will see him remain at Hillsborough until 2010. Simek suffered a serious ankle injury playing against Crystal Palace in December 2007. The injury kept him out of the Wednesday first team for over ten months. He made a slow return with a number of reserve team appearances followed by an appearance on the substitutes bench against Birmingham City on 25 October 2008, and then finally a return to first team football three days later when he came on as a substitute against Plymouth. =Carlisle United= Simek signed for Carlisle United on a 2-year contract and joined the squad on 1 July 2010. Since then he has been an ever-present in the United team, apart from the start of the 2011–12 season in which he suffered an injury that left him out of action for 5 months. Replacements such as James Tavernier and Christian Ribeiro filled the Right-Back position in Simek's absence but upon his recovery he instantly earned his place in the Carlisle team yet again. In July 2012, Simek signed a new one-year deal with Carlisle United, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2013.

He served in the Special Forces in the early-1980s, and he became a writer in the mid-1990s. He focused on military writing after the invasion of Iraq. Yon has been embedded on numerous occasions with American and British troops in Iraq, most prominently a deployment with the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Regiment (Deuce Four) of the 25th Infantry Division in Mosul, Iraq that ended in September 2005.Replacing Fatalism with Hope . Kathryn Jean Lopez. National Review. Published April 21, 2008. Retrieved August 3, 2009. Yon has had vocal feuds with the United States military hierarchy, and the nature of his reports are also controversial. However, Yon at one time enjoyed \\"rock star\\" status among individual soldiers, according to Brian Williams of NBC. Yon's alternative media reporting has been mentioned by numerous mainstream media agencies, and he has won accolades from the 2005, 2007, and 2008 Weblog Awards. In 2008, The New York Times reported that he has spent more time embedded with combat units than any other journalist in Iraq. He shifted the focus of his blogging from Iraq to Afghanistan in August 2008. His work is supported primarily by donations from readers. Background Yon grew up in Winter Haven, Florida, where he says he essentially raised himself. As a child and as a young adult, he was a prankster who got in trouble for, among other things, making homemade bombs. Other children bullied him repeatedly throughout his childhood, particularly because of his short stature. He went to a local community college and did not express any interest in journalism. After graduation, he enlisted in the United States Army in his late teens for the college money.Lone Gun in War Reporting. By James Rainey. The Los Angeles Times. Published February 9, 2006. Retrieved August 3, 2009. Because of his light blond hair, short stature, and physical boastfulness, other soldiers nicknamed him \\"Bam Bam\\", after the Flintstones character. He killed a man in a bar room fight in Ocean City, Maryland in the 1980s; criminal charges were filed but later dropped. Yon's first book, Danger Close, details this event and tells the story of his life up to the age of 20, after he had completed the selection and training process for the United States Army Special Forces. Yon was discharged from the Army in 1987, and worked in a variety of different businesses, and for a while provided security detail for the late pop star Michael Jackson. He later described Jackson as a \\"hostage of his own success\\" while also stating that he enjoyed his experiences with him at Neverland Ranch before the scandals. Having learned German and some Polish within the service, he also attempted to work in Poland. He started general freelance writing in the mid-1990s despite having no background in the field. Notably, he covered the Aghori, an obscure Hindu cult that eats human flesh to supposedly gain magic powers. Yon believed that he had located an American cult member and passed his suspicions on to the FBI. He began writing about the occupation of Iraq after the death of two of his army friends, one of whom he had known since high school. Yon first landed in Baghdad in late December 2004. He covered the war in Iraq for several years afterward, notably covering the Deuce Four forces. Yon briefly stopped over to Afghanistan in early 2006. In December 2007, Yon was present in Basra with 4th Battalion, The Rifles during the British withdrawal from the city. He subsequently visited England and met the Duchess of Cornwall. Yon praised her for what he saw as her unstinting support for her troops. Yon moved to covering the War in Afghanistan in August 2008, which he said had become the most important field in the war on terrorism. He attempted to travel to Pakistan in June 2009, but his visa application was denied. That month, he also traveled to Singapore, Bahrain, the Philippines, and Turkey to report on Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' security meetings. From July 2019 until he was deported on 5 February 2020, Yon had been reporting on the ground from the 2019 Hong Kong Protests. Personal views Yon has stated, in general, that \\"If a writer wants to make money, he should avoid truth and tell people what they want to hear. Yet to win the war, tell the truth.\\"Exclusive: Michael Yon on torture. By Ed Morrissey and Michael Yon. Hot Air. Posted March 3, 2009. He supports embedded journalism over traditional reporting, believing that the closer writers are to events the less likely they are to repeat military public relations spin. Yon was reluctant to say about whether he supported the decision to go to war. He eventually said he had been a supporter because to his concerns about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction, which he had given the Bush Administration the benefit of the doubt over. After first visiting Iraq in December 2004, Yon said the situation in the country was far more violent than the mainstream media had reported. During the next year, he reported that \\"Iraq was falling apart\\" and was in a civil war. He also believed that NATO forces were \\"losing\\" the war in Afghanistan. Yon was a vocal proponent of a 'surge' strategy in Iraq and expressed his support in many interviews for Senator John McCain in the 2008 Presidential election. Agreeing with McCain, Yon opposes the use of torture by the U.S. military, and specifically opposes waterboarding. In June 2009, he remarked: \\"I get the feeling that Obama is tougher and proving wiser than many people seem to think\\". Yon also wrote in the aftermath of the Iranian election protests that he agreed with controversial author Michael Ledeen's views about Iran. In an August 2009 interview at Helmand Province, he reiterated his belief that the Afghan Taliban are stronger than the NATO presence, comparing the situation to Apocalypse Now. Describing how his personal views affect his writing, Yon stated, \\"I feel no shame in saying I am biased in favor of our troops. Even worse, I feel no shame in calling a terrorist a terrorist\\". The New York Times commented that \\"Like most bloggers, Mr. Yon has an agenda, writing often that the United States’ mission to build a stable, democratic Iraq is succeeding and must continue.\\" The Los Angeles Times has called him \\"the reporter of choice for many conservatives\\", although journalist Michael Totten calls Yon a \\"refreshingly unideological analyst of the war\\". Yon has praised several media agencies he has worked with, saying \\"The journalists for places like the New York Times and Wall Street Journal are actually very good with their facts.\\" In his 2008 book Moment of Truth in Iraq, Yon wrote: Yon supports the personal use of his images and writings by ordinary people, but he believes that larger institutions such as television networks and magazines should respect his copyright. As such, he has taken on numerous legal cases. He wrote in August 2008 that he spends about $100,000 a year in those efforts. =General themes= Yon's writing is marked by its fondness for American service personnel and Iraqis, both military and civilian alike. He sees those groups as engaging bravely in a just nation-building. USA Today has called him \\"unflinchingly pro-military\\". It is also marked by candor about what he regards as U.S. and Iraqi failures, which led The Los Angeles Times to label Yon a \\"lone gun\\". For example, Yon notably covered the story of an Iraqi taxi driver mistakenly killed by U.S. troops. Yon's work is often graphic in its nature compared to other reporting. Yon's reports detail his conflicts with the U.S. military command as well, which culminated in an October 2008 article in The Weekly Standard titled \\"Censoring Iraq\\". In particular, Yon has accused Barry A. Johnson of US Central Command of \\"a subtle but all too real censorship\\" as well as \\"ineptitude in handling the press\\".Censoring Iraq. The Weekly Standard. Volume 012, Issue 07. Published October 30, 2006. Retrieved August 3, 2009. The article nearly caused the military to ban Yon from re- entering Iraq. Yon frequently criticizes what he sees as inept public relations efforts from the Army staff. The style of Yon's reports has garnered praise from The New York Times, calling it \\"enough first-hand observation, clarity and skepticism to put many professional journalists to shame\\", as well as Slate, calling it \\"the grizzled, noirish [sic] style of war reportage from earlier eras.\\" Military.com has stated that Yon re-defined war coverage for the new media. Yon has also been criticized by members of the Army, such as by Lt. Col. Steven Boylan in September 2005, who have said that he violated his embed agreement by releasing photos of dead and injured soldiers before their family members were notified. He also has been accused of skirting Army rules by working before he formally signed up with a news agency. However, Yon is not employed by any news organization, and employment by a news organization is not a requirement for embedding with U.S. Forces. Yon's editorial columns have run in National Review Online and in The New York Post. Although working as a writer, Yon crossed the line in Mosul and engaged in combat in an attempt to save the lives of four American soldiers. The Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Erik Kurilla, had been shot three times, while CSM Robb Prosser was fighting hand-to-hand combat with the Al Qaeda member who just shot Kurilla. Two American Soldiers, frozen in fear, refused to fight. Yon had a chance to flee but instead, while CSM Prosser was fighting the terrorist hand-to-hand, he grabbed Prosser's empty rifle, took ammunition from a lieutenant who refused to fight, and Yon joined combat. His dispatch about the incident became his best known work, but it led to a strict reprimand from the Army administration. He wrote in August 2009 that it is not his place to directly interfere in what he covers. =Awards and media references= Yon won the 2008 Weblog Award Poll for 'Best Military Blog' on December 31, 2008, and he won the 2007 Weblog Award for 'Best Military Blog' on November 1, 2007. He won the 2005 Weblog Award for 'Best Media/Journalism Blog' as well. In January 2006, his blog was one of the 100 most linked on the internet according to Technorati. Websites for the CNN, ABC, and CBS networks have referred to his work. He has appeared on the CBS Early Show and Good Morning America shows. Yon has been quoted by Fox News,Hi-Tech Choppers Are Key to American Mission in Afghanistan. By Matt Sanchez. Fox News. Published March 10, 2009. Retrieved August 3, 2009. by Newsmax, and by Times Online.A hero’s death redeems Abu Ghraib tormentor. By Sarah Baxter. Times Online. Published March 8, 2009. Retrieved August 3, 2009. His reporting has gained the praise of some well- known and respected journalists, including Christopher Booker and Toby Harnden of The Daily Telegraph, Brian Williams of NBC, foreign correspondent Joe Galloway, Alex Perry of Time, and US News and World Report writer Michael Barone. Barone has referred to Yon's work in his column. Oliver North has supported Yon's reporting, and John Gibson cited Yon in an editorial. New York University professor Jay Rosen has named Yon's writing as a prominent example of successful citizen journalism. Bruce Willis has stated his intention to produce a movie about Deuce Four's deployment in Iraq, to be largely based on Yon's experiences with the unit. Willis said, “What he is doing is something the American media and maybe the world media isn’t doing... telling the truth about what's happening in the war in Iraq.” =Selected writings and related issues= 2005 – Little Girl story and photograph In May 2005, Yon took a picture of U.S. Army Major Mark Bieger cradling an Iraqi girl, named Farah, wounded by shrapnel from a car bomb. Major Bieger tried to take the girl to an American hospital to receive treatment, but she died on the helicopter ride. Yon wrote shortly after taking the picture that it \\"provoked a flood of messages and heartfelt responses from caring people around the world.\\" The photo created international news media attention as well. It was submitted to Time. Their website's viewers selected it as the 'Top Photo of 2005'. It received 66% of the vote. An Islamic-based non-violence organization asked to use the picture, and Yon gave his permission. Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore used the photo without permission at michaelmoore.com, with it placed alongside then-Senator Hillary Clinton attacking her support for the invasion of Iraq. In May 2008, Yon wrote that he planned to sue Moore for copyright infringement and described some of Moore's media work as pornographic. 2006 – Battle with Shock magazine In 2006, the 'Little Girl' image was the center of a controversy when it was used by the Hachette Filipacchi Médias’ publication Shock magazine. The magazine displayed the picture in a context that was critical of the war in Iraq. Yon felt this usage of the photo both dishonored U.S. troops and breached his copyright. He especially criticized the fact that the agency released the disputed article on Memorial Day. Yon contacted his lawyers and agreed with Hachette Filipacchi Médias that he would be paid a licensing fee, with the majority of proceeds going to a charity supporting US military families. On June 9, 2006, the agreement appears to have collapsed, with Yon alleging further misuse of the image by Hachette Filipacchi Médias at its shocku.com website. 2007 – Reporting atrocities by Al-Qaeda in Iraq Through June and July 2007, Yon followed multinational forces in battles at and around Baqubah during Operation Arrowhead Ripper, and he reported that the forces discovered a mass grave at the al Hamari village. Yon stated that Al Qaeda elements had murdered hundreds of innocent people in the area. He compared the scene to the 'Killing Fields' of Cambodia. He speculated from the positions of some of the bodies' that the militants may have forced a father to dig the graves of his children before their summary execution. Yon wrote on July 18 that the news media had been ignoring the story. An Iraqi official later said that the insurgents had, among other atrocities, baked a young boy and served him to his parents. Yon himself wrote in a later dispatch that he offers \\"no opinion about the veracity of [the official's] words\\". 2008 – Moment of Truth in Iraq In April 2008, Yon published his second book, Moment of Truth in Iraq, through Richard Vigilante Books. The book describes how U.S. counterinsurgency methods are creating what Yon sees as a foundation of success in Iraq. Within two weeks of its release date, Moment of Truth entered into Amazon.com's list of Top 10 bestsellers. Yon was quoted by fellow blogger Glenn Reynolds as saying, \\"That's just wild. Folks really did want that book after all. I was wondering how many people even cared. It's great to know that people want to really know what's going on.\\" 2010 – Conflicts with ISAF military command Through spring 2010, Yon engaged in an ongoing war of words with Canadian Army Brigadier-General Daniel Menard and US General Stanley McChrystal, the latter who commanded International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Yon accused Menard of incompetence when the Tarnak Bridge was destroyed by insurgents, near the Canadian Area of Operations, claiming that Menard had been watching a hockey game at the time. When it was publicly demonstrated that the bridge was not a Canadian responsibility, Yon blasted Menard for negligently firing his weapon in Kandahar. Yon publicly admitted that he would not have looked into the rumors of the negligent discharge(ND), if it weren't for the bridge controversy. Menard was later charged with an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate. While Yon complained that neither the ND nor affair was the issue, he claimed victory in taking the General's \\"scalp.\\" The attacks on a coalition partner and allied General were embarrassing to the ISAF and diplomatic efforts. It appears that this resulted in a breakdown of relationships between Yon and the Public Affairs Office of McChrystal, which Yon described as \\"crazy monkeys.\\" Despite Yon's praise for General McChrystal on the eve of the Tarnak Bridge incident, his Facebook updates became increasingly critical after Yon was disembedded. While most of Yon's criticism focused on McChrystal's media relations, he also criticized Stanley McChrystal's war strategy on many occasions, particularly the restrictive Rules of engagement under his command. Daily Telegraph journalist Toby Harnden described Yon's commentary as \\"excoriating\\". Yon suggested that McChrystal's specialized background in the U.S. Special Forces left him ill-prepared to manage the ISAF, with \\"an incompetence... that I've never seen before\\". After publication of a June 2010 Rolling Stone article containing controversial quotes from McCrystal and his staff, which mocked their civilian Obama administration colleagues, Yon wrote; \\"Unless McChrystal basically denies the article, he must be fired. If he is not fired, I will start calling him President McChrystal because Obama clearly is not in charge.\\" Both McChrystal and Menard later left their commands. After General David H. Petraeus was appointed to Stanley McCrystal's command, Yon sent Petraeus a message of support and later wrote on his Facebook page that Petraeus sent back \\"a nice response\\". In 2013, Yon criticized General Martin Dempsey for the policy of painting a bright red crosses on medical evacuation helicopters. Yon felt it identified them as unarmed targets. 2015 – Comfort women On September 2007, Yon spoke at the IWG 2007 conference to claim Japan's innocence on the sexual enslavement of the Imperial Japanese comfort women before and during WWII. However, he failed to mention a U.S. informant's report on the Japanese Military not preventing the abuse and rape of Malaysian women at a 'licensed public comfort houses', which led to historians and authors disagreeing with him.https://www.archives.gov/files/iwg/reports/final- report-2007.pdfhttp://eng.the-liberty.com/2014/5641/ On 2014, FeND Now Network's (Japan-U.S. Feminist Network for Decolonization) feminist writer, Emi Koyama, and Monthly Hanada Magazine's right-wing editor-in-chief, Kazuyoshi Hanada reported Michael Yon receiving or was promised book deals, financial agreements, and speaking tours from Yoshiko Sakurai, a conservative member from the Global Alliance for Historical Truth, and the Nippon Kaigi. He was tasked to publish articles about denying the comfort women system as a form of sexual slavery in the English media, and spoke at her think tank about it. Al Jazeera also reported that Yon viewed the comfort women issue as a strategic \\"information war\\" meant to keep Japan divided and weak.Penn, Michael. \\"Japan's 'comfort women' battle spills into the US.\\" Al Jazeera (Qatar) 16 Mar. 2015: Points of View Reference Center. Web. 20 Dec. 2015. On 2015, his affiliation with them deteriorated when he opposed Sakurai's attempt to promote the film Scottsboro Girls in Japan and America. This is a 2015 film directed by Taniyama Yūjirō aimed at drawing a parallel between the Scottsboro Boys - a group of African-American young men who were falsely accused of raping white women - and the comfort women, who Taniyama was claiming were prostitutes who were lying about having been raped. Yon warned Sakurai and Taniyama Yūjirō that promoting the film would not only damage Japan but offend America because of the film's lack of understanding of American values. When Mariko Okada-Collins, a Japanese language instructor from Central Washington University invited them to show the film in her university, he terminated his deal with Sakurai. Though he broke off with the other Japanese nationalist movements, he continues to publish many posts on his blog and social media to this day claiming this issue to be a lie. In 2018, he published his full- length Japanese book on this topic. =Kopp-Etchells Effect= Kopp-Etchells effect The effect is a consequence of sand hitting helicopter rotors in sandy environments. Abrasion strips on helicopter rotor blades are made of metal, often titanium or nickel, which are very hard, but less hard than sand. When a helicopter flies low to the ground in desert environments, sand striking the rotor blade can cause erosion. At night, sand hitting the metal abrasion strip causes a visible corona or halo around the rotor blades. The effect is caused by the pyrophoric oxidation of eroded particles and is known as the Kopp- Etchells Effect. Michael Yon observed the effect while accompanying U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan. When he discovered the effect had no name he coined the name \\"Kopp-Etchells Effect\\" after two soldiers who had died in the war, one American and one British.

The mission of Noah's Wish is to save animals during disasters with their rescue and recovery services and to mitigate the impact of disasters on animals through educational outreach programs. The organization travels to areas affected by disaster and evacuate pets and livestock. They shelter, feed and provide medical care for the animals until they can be returned to their owners or housed more permanently. Based in El Dorado Hills, California, the organization has helped relief efforts internationally, such as after the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami hit Sri Lanka in December 2004 and after the August 2005 flooding in Romania. Within North America, they have assisted in the wake of a number of forest fires and hurricanes since being founded in 2002. Outside of relief work, the organization trains volunteers to deal effectively and practically in disaster situations. Noah's Wish set up a rescue operation in Slidell, Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast in September 2005. As of November 25, 2005 they cared for 1,564 animals during this situation, and reunited more than 1,257 lost pets with their owners. Legal troubles After Hurricane Katrina, Noah's Wish settled with the state of California, forfeiting $4 million of $8 million it had collected. Noah's Wish was one of a few, but egregious, animal charity scams. The forfeiture was used to build an animal rescue shelter in Slidell, Louisiana.

In general, prediction tools take as input information about a protein, such as a protein sequence of amino acids, and produce a predicted location within the cell as output, such as the nucleus, Endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, extracellular space, or other organelles. The aim is to build tools that can accurately predict the outcome of protein targeting in cells. Prediction of protein subcellular localization is an important component of bioinformatics based prediction of protein function and genome annotation, and it can aid the identification of drug targets.  Background  Experimentally determining the subcellular localization of a protein can be a laborious and time consuming task. Immunolabeling or tagging (such as with a green fluorescent protein) to view localization using fluorescence microscope are often used. A high throughput alternative is to use prediction. Through the development of new approaches in computer science, coupled with an increased dataset of proteins of known localization, computational tools can now provide fast and accurate localization predictions for many organisms. This has resulted in subcellular localization prediction becoming one of the challenges being successfully aided by bioinformatics, and machine learning. Many prediction methods now exceed the accuracy of some high-throughput laboratory methods for the identification of protein subcellular localization. Particularly, some predictors have been developed that can be used to deal with proteins that may simultaneously exist, or move between, two or more different subcellular locations. Experimental validation is typically required to confirm the predicted localizations.  Tools  In 1999 PSORT was the first published program to predict subcellular localization. Subsequent tools and websites have been released using techniques such as artificial neural networks, support vector machine and protein motifs. Predictors can be specialized for proteins in different organisms. Some are specialized for eukaryotic proteins, some for human proteins, and some for plant proteins. Methods for the prediction of bacterial localization predictors, and their accuracy, have been reviewed. The development of protein subcellular location prediction has been summarized in two comprehensive review articles.Nakai, K. Protein sorting signals and prediction of subcellular localization. Adv. Protein Chem., 2000, 54, 277-344.Chou, K. C.; Shen, H. B. Review: Recent progresses in protein subcellular location prediction\\" Anal. Biochem 2007, 370, 1-16. Recent tools and an experience report can be found in a recent paper by Meinken and Min (2012).  Application  Knowledge of the subcellular localization of a protein can significantly improve target identification during the drug discovery process. For example, secreted proteins and plasma membrane proteins are easily accessible by drug molecules due to their localization in the extracellular space or on the cell surface. Bacterial cell surface and secreted proteins are also of interest for their potential as vaccine candidates or as diagnostic targets. Aberrant subcellular localization of proteins has been observed in the cells of several diseases, such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Secreted proteins from some archaea that can survive in unusual environments have industrially important applications. By using prediction a high number of proteins can be assessed in order to find candidates that are trafficked to the desired location.  Databases  The results of subcellular localization prediction can be stored in databases. Examples include the multi-species database Compartments, FunSecKB2, a fungal database; PlantSecKB, a plant database; MetazSecKB, an animal and human database; and ProtSecKB, a protist database.

As a community it consists of the townships of Capel Dewi, Horeb, Pontsian, Pren- gwyn, Tregroes, Rhydowen and the village of Llandysul itself. At the 2001 Census the community had a population of 1,484,2011 Census - http://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/ks101ew reducing to 1,439 at the 2011 Census. Llandysul lies in south Ceredigion in the valley of the River Teifi and is visited for its fishing and canoeing. The wider community has a population of 2,732, as of 2011. The built-up area had a population of 1484. Llandysul is also known as the home of Gwasg Gomer, one of the most prominent publishers of Welsh-interest and Welsh language books in Wales. The town is twinned with Plogonnec (Plogoneg) in Brittany, France. History Llandysul bridge Pencoedfoel is an Iron Age hillfort one mile northeast of Llandysul. An oval banked and ditched enclosure with double ramparts, about 160m by 128m, is defined by degraded banks and scarps on the summit of an isolated hill. Two halves of a bronze collar were found near here, possibly dating to the late 1st century BC or early 1st century AD.Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales The oldest building in the town is the church which dates from the 13th century. It as built on the site of the original church from the 6th century. Saint Tysul was the grandson of Ceredig ap Cunedda (hence the name Ceredigion) and a cousin of St David. Fairs and markets were established by the Kings of England and the Edwardian marcher lords who captured these lands from the native rulers between the 12th and 14th centuries. Owain Glyndŵr is associated with the town. The men of Llandysul supported him in battle in 1400 and afterwards his lands around Llandysul were confiscated by Henry IV. In 1644, during the English Civil War, the Royalist army was defending Ceredigion against the Parliamentary army. One of the three arches of the bridge at Llandysul was pulled down by the Royalists to prevent the Parliamentarians crossing into Ceredigion. The bridge was later rebuilt with a single arch. The Teifi Valley around Llandysul was the home of the Welsh woollen industry. Many sheep were reared locally and there were plenty of fast-flowing streams to power machinery so many woollen mills were established in the area in the 19th century. There was also a flannel shirt factory in the town at that time. The mills had nearly all been closed by the end of the 20th century as cheaper textiles became available from the Far East. The Gomer Press () was founded by John David Lewis (1859–1914). He started by selling books from a corner of his father's grocery store before establishing the press in 1892. It is now a thriving printing company and the largest publishing house in Wales and moved to new premises just outside the town in 2004. It publishes titles for both adults and children, in English and in Welsh. The present managing director, Jonathan Lewis, is the great grandson of the founder. Economy There is little industry in Llandysul today. The woollen mills are closed and used for other purposes. One houses a confectionery distribution business. There used to be a fortnightly livestock market but it closed in 2008 when the site became part of the new Llandysul bypass. Tourism draws people into West Wales but Llandysul largely misses out from this source of income as it houses no specific tourist attractions. Llandyssul was a railway station on the Newcastle Emlyn branch, opened in 1864 and closed to passengers in 1952. Telynau Teifi Harps is a community business set up with help from Ceredigion County Council and the European Union in 2004 by harp maker Allan Shiers. It is the only harp-making business in Wales, a country with a traditional association with the instrument. Celtic and folk harps are made here and the whole manufacturing process takes place on the site. Llandysul Paddlers Canoe Centre was opened in October 1998. It holds courses and provides accommodation for up to 35 visitors. Canoeing brings in visitors who contribute to the local economy. Culture and community Children playing in the pool at Calon Tysul overseen by a lifeguard Capel y Graig, Llandysul, c. 1885 The Memorial Park is a recreation area in a loop of the River Teifi. There is a children's playground, a tennis club, a bowling club and sports pitches. Llandysul Cricket Club and Llandysul Football Club play here. The cricket club fields two sides in the South Wales Cricket Association (Division One and Division Six) and has a thriving youth section. The soccer club likewise field two teams in Division One and Two of the Ceredigion League and were league champions in 2016-7 as well as winners of the Emrys Morgan Cup. The Tysul Hall was built in 1955 as a memorial to the men lost in two world wars. It can seat 400 people and events and meetings are held there. Llandysul has a post office, two chemists, a range of other shops, a church, several chapels and a leisure centre with swimming pool. The last of four major banks in Llandysul closed in 2017 Llandysul Angling Association owns the rights to over 30 miles of fishing on the River Teifi which is a river noted for its salmon, sea trout and trout. Llandysul Paddlers is a non profit making association which works with young people from the community and across the whole of the UK. They deliver sessions on kayaking, white water rafting and canoeing, away from the water they deliver sessions about climbing and mountain biking and help local schools in their delivery of the DofE scheme. The Powerhouse is a community and arts centre designed to host a variety of activities. It is housed in a historic building beside the River Teifi that originally generated power for the local community. Llandysul and District Local History Society have an exhibition in the upstairs room of Llandysul Library. Calon Tysul was founded in November 2017. The site is an amalgamation of two previously separate entities; Llandysul Aqua Centre and Llandysul Leisure Centre. The site includes a 25m × 10m swimming pool, formerly known as Teifiside Swimming Pool. The pool was built with the help of town residents in 1975 and was later renamed Llandysul Aqua Centre following a restructure. The adjoining Llandysul Leisure Centre was built in 2003 by Ceredigion County Council. The council maintained and operated the centre from 2003 - 2017. Following a community asset transfer in 2017, Llandysul Leisure Centre and the land beneath the swimming pool came into the ownership of the trustees of Calon Tysul. As well as the swimming pool, the building also includes a sports hall with space for four badminton courts, a multi-purpose room, fitness suite as well as wet and dry changing facilities. A board of voluntary trustees is responsible for the governance of the centre. A wide variety of recreational and educational activities take place at the centre, such as swimming, kayaking, children's birthday parties, National Exercise Referral Scheme, fitness classes, badminton, table tennis, climbing, football and more. Several groups such Llandysul Cubs and Beavers and Llandysul Crafters meet at the centre. Education There were two schools in the town. Ysgol Dyffryn Teifi,Ysgol Dyffryn Teify , a bilingual comprehensive school with over 500 pupils, and Ysgol Gynradd Llandysul, a bilingual primary school; both were closed in 2016 due to the opening of a new super school Ysgol Bro Teifi. Llandysul Paddlers also works as an education centre delivering sessions to young people and adults and has a number of full-time trained teachers working for them.  Church  St Tysul's Church The church of St Tysul was founded by Saint Tysul, 462–554, at the meeting place of a number of tracks at a ford over the River Teifi. The present stone structure dates from the 13th century and the roof remained thatched until 1783. The ancient altar with its early Christian inscription was incorporated into the altar of the Lady Chapel. The simple nave is separated from the north and south aisles by plain square pillars. Other ancient carved stones are found in the choir vestry. One of these is the Velvor Stone, a fragment cut from the middle of an inscribed slab.St Tysul's Church, Llandysul. A Short History and Guide by I. T. Hughes and J. R. Jenkins. The tower houses a ring of six bells which are rung regularly. Calan Hen (\\"Old New Year's Day\\") is an interesting custom associated with the church. It dates from 1752, when eleven days were lost in the change from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. On the old New Year's Day, now 12 January, it was the custom for harvest workers to be given a feast. The rest of the day was spent kicking a ball about. Kickoff was halfway between the two goals, Llanwenog Church porch and Llandysul Church porch. Most of the players were drunk by this time and it was a rough affair. In 1833, the vicar of Llandysul, Reverend Enoch James, substituted a different way of celebrating Calan Hen. It was a gathering in Llandysul Church of the Sunday Schools of the churches within 8 miles of Llandysul to answer catechisms, sing anthems and recite scriptures.St Tysul's Church, Llandysul. A Short History and Guide by I. T. Hughes and J. R. Jenkins, p.10. The custom continues to this day. Rev. Gareth Reid was appointed priest-in-charge of St Tysul's Church (and other churches in the benefice) in June 2013. Information about church activities can be found on the St Tysul's church website. In October 2014, lightning struck the church tower causing damage to the crenellations in the northeast corner, resulting in chunks of masonry falling on the roof below. The church and graveyard were fenced off for safety reasons until repairs to the church and tower could be completed. The church was reopened six months later.

Discoveries at Wistar have led to the creation of vaccines that protect children and adults from widespread, debilitating, and life-threatening diseases and have saved countless lives in the U.S. and abroad: * A vaccine against rubella (German measles) developed in 1969 at Wistar has been successfully used worldwide since the 1970s and is administered in the U.S. as part of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combination vaccine. The Wistar-developed vaccine led the charge in the eradication of rubella, which was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2004. * Two rabies vaccines were developed at Wistar and are used worldwide to prevent rabies-related deaths in humans and wildlife. One is administered as a post- exposure treatment and is nearly 100% effective in preventing fatal rabies infection. It is also given to people at high risk of exposure, including veterinarians and wildlife officers. This vaccine, which was developed at Wistar in the 1960s and ‘70s, has helped to make rabies-related human death a rarity in the U.S. and many other countries. Another Wistar vaccine, licensed in 1995, is used to prevent rabies infection in wildlife. * Wistar scientists are co-creators of a rotavirus vaccine that was licensed by the Food & Drug Administration in 2016 and is routinely administered in the United States and around the world. The rotavirus vaccine contributes to saving U.S. children from 250,000 emergency room visits and 70,000 hospitalizations each year. * Wistar contributed technology critical to the development of the first vaccine for the Zika virus approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be tested in humans. Education and training Educating and training the next generation of scientists are central to Wistar's mission. The Institute has developed several programs targeted to all levels of education: * Postdoctoral program: postdoctoral fellows at Wistar carry out research under the mentorship of one of the faculty members and are offered a well-rounded training program aimed toward successful independent research careers. Funding is available from two different NIH training grants at Wistar and there are several awards for trainee excellence. * Graduate programs: doctoral training at Wistar can be pursued through the University of Pennsylvania and the Cancer Biology Graduate Program, which is jointly overseen by the University of the Sciences and Wistar. * Biomedical Technician Training Program: the program, jointly developed by Wistar and Community College of Philadelphia (CCP), is designed to prepare community college students for new career opportunities as research assistants and technicians, combining academic course work at CCP with specialized laboratory training the Institute and other affiliated research institutes. * Biomedical Research Technician Apprenticeship: this is the first-ever registered, nontraditional apprenticeship program for biomedical research ratified by the Pennsylvania Department of Labor & Industry and offers a high level of specialization and training towards a career pathway to becoming biomedical research technicians in a research laboratory environment. * High School Fellowship in Biomedical Research: the program provides an opportunity for students to enhance their understanding of current biological/biomedical theory and research tools and techniques. Students are integrated into the daily work of the laboratories, gaining exposure to different facets of research. Mentors help students apply their current knowledge and skills and assist them in making the connection between laboratory experience and their academic studies. History =Beginnings= Dr. Caspar Wistar The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology was named for Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761-1818), a prominent Philadelphia physician, and chair of the anatomy department at the University of Pennsylvania. He wrote and published the first American textbook on anatomy--A System of Anatomy: Volume 1 (1811), Volume 2 (1814).Wistarabilia: 125 Years of Research Achievements and Improving Human Health (The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, 2017). To augment his medical lectures and illustrate comparative anatomy, Dr. Wistar began collecting dried, wax-injected, preserved human specimens. Two years prior to his death in 1818, he gave the collection to Dr. William Edmonds Horner, another Philadelphia physician. Dr. Horner expanded the collection, which became known as the Wistar and Horner Museum. The collection was further expanded by its next curator, Dr. Joseph Leidy, who added animal specimens, fossils and anthropological samples. By the late 1880s, the collection was beginning to show signs of neglect and wear, compounded by a fire in Logan Hall, the University of Pennsylvania building that housed the museum. Isaac Jones Wistar Gen. Isaac Jones Wistar, 1898 Dr. Wistar's great- nephew, Isaac Jones Wistar (1827-1905), founded The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology in 1892. He was a prominent Philadelphia lawyer who had argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, and risen through the ranks to brigadier general during the Civil War. Gen. Wistar made a fortune building railroads after the war, and became a vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad. Approached by the University about making a donation toward preserving the Wistar and Horner Museum, Gen. Wistar determined to fund a new building for it himself. His vision soon expanded beyond housing the collection to creating the Wistar Institute, to sponsor and publish new medical research and \\"any other work for the increase of original scientific knowledge.\\" The University provided a plot of land on the west side of 36th Street, between Spruce Street and Woodland Avenue (originally designated for the University library).George E. Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works (New York: Princeton Architectural Press), p. 290. Wistar hired architects George W. and William G. Hewitt to design the museum/laboratory,Wistar Institute of Anatomy at Philadelphia Architects and Buildings. and the building was dedicated on May 21, 1894. Dr. Horace Jayne served as its director from January 1894 to December 1903. Gen. Wistar and his wife were childless, and he was a widower for the last decade of his life.Richard Wistar Davids, Wistar Family: A Genealogy of the Descendants of Caspar Wistar, Emigrant in 1717 (Philadelphia: by the author, 1896), p. 13. He established an endowment of more than $1,000,000 for the Institute, which generated an annual income of $30,000, as noted in his September 19, 1905 New York Times obituary. He significantly increased that endowment after death by bequeathing the bulk of his estate to the Institute. Instead of being buried beside his wife at Laurel Hill Cemetery,Sarah Toland Wistar from Find-A-Grave. Gen. Wistar was interred at the Institute.Isaac Jones Wistar from Find-A-Grave. In 1914, the Institute posthumously published his autobiography, to which it added an addendum detailing his generosity: The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, under construction, 1894 > After General Wistar had erected a fireproof museum and laboratory building > at a cost of $125,000 on grounds presented by the University of > Pennsylvania, on September 1, 1893, he created a trust fund of about > $130,000 for the support of the Institute.

A bronze bust of Gen. Wistar by sculptor Samuel Murray is exhibited in the Institute's museum.Isaac Jones Wistar from Smithsonian Institution Research Information System. The Institute's original building is a National Register of Historic Places contributing property in the University of Pennsylvania Campus Historic District. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission recognized the Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology with a state historic marker in 2007.The Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology Historical Marker from PMHC. =20th Century= 1905 conference in the Wistar Institute Library Shortly after the turn of the 20th century, The Wistar Institute began to embody Gen. Wistar's vision of a center for “new and original research” in the biological and medical sciences. Under the leadership of Milton Greenman, M.D., and Henry Donaldson, Ph.D., the Institute prioritized its research into experimental and investigative biology. Helen Dean King, Ph.D., developed and bred the Wistar rat, the first standardized laboratory animal model from which more than half of all laboratory rats today are thought to be descended. The Institute also gained international recognition as a training ground for young scientists thanks to the scientific journals published by the Wistar Press. Between 1905 and 1925, Wistar scientists published 227 original scientific papers. By 1925, the Institute had solidified its reputation as a center of American biology. The modern era of scientific discovery at Wistar began under the leadership of virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski, M.D., who served as director from 1957 to 1991. During his tenure, the Institute became a leader in vaccine and cancer research. Seminal advancements in cell culture technology were also made at Wistar in that period, with the creation of the WI-38 cell line by Leonard Hayflick, Ph.D., and Paul S. Moorhead, Ph.D. This cell line was used for the development of several vaccines at the Institute and in laboratories around the world. By the 1970s, Wistar was devoting a major part of its effort and financial resources to cancer research, and in 1972, the Institute earned the designation of National Cancer Institute Cancer Center in basic research. A new Cancer Research building and a vivarium were erected in 1975. Wistar scientists were among the first to develop antiviral and antitumor monoclonal antibodies that have been widely used as tools for basic research and to develop therapies against cancer and immune diseases. Wistar scientists have been pioneers in the study of oncogenes and the genetic basis of cancer. =21st Century= The Robert and Penny Fox Research Tower, the latest addition to the Wistar research facility, opened its doors in 2014, adding nearly 90,000 square feet of cutting-edge laboratory space to the Institute and allowing a more integrated style of research that reflects the “team science” discovery approach.

It is approachable from the Atlantic Ocean, where it enters at the town of Tavira in the Algarve, east of Faro. The river Gilão changes its name to Rio Séqua at the ancient bridge named Ponte Romana in the centre of Tavira. The river's source is located in the Serra do Caldeirão mountains of the central Algarve, at the confluence of the Asseca, Zimbral and Alportel rivers, the latter rising north of São Brás de Alportel. From here it flows in a southeasterly direction and passes through the Ria Formosa national park south of Tavira, eventually meeting the Atlantic Ocean between the barrier islands of Tavira and Cabanas. The channel is clear, but a bit meandering. There is a large tide swing of about feet. There are extensive mariculture clam beds and salt pans near the sea. The name Gilão comes from Gil with doubtful origin but it sounds like the Old Norse word gill meaning stream.

Career One of Deodato's first works was a 1993 photo-realistic comic book adaptation of the television series Beauty and the Beast published by Innovation Publishing. Deodato became famous in the North American comic book industry for his work with writer William Messner-Loebs on Wonder Woman. After his Wonder Woman project he had a short stint as the penciller of The Mighty Thor, where he worked with writer Warren Ellis, and later drew Glory for Rob Liefeld's Extreme Studios at Image Comics and Maximum Press. While his style in the mid-1990s was highly reminiscent of Jim Lee, he has recently changed to a more simplified, photo-realistic and sometimes moody style. His first work with this new artistic identity was The Incredible Hulk, written by Bruce Jones. Since then, he has worked on the Doctor Strange spin-off Witches and became the regular penciller of The Amazing Spider-Man and The New Avengers. Deodato then took over as regular penciller for the Marvel title Thunderbolts with issue 110, once again collaborating with Warren Ellis. Deodato then became the regular artist for the Dark Avengers ongoing series which came out of the conclusion of Secret Invasion. With writer Ed Brubaker, he launched the ongoing series Secret Avengers in May 2010, before returning to New Avengers. in 2012 he became the penciller of The Avengers and The New Avengers. Deodato worked with Jason Aaron on the eight-issue flagship comic of Marvel's 2014 crossover storyline, Original Sin. In 2017 Deodato drew the Astonishing X-Men ongoing series with writer Charles Soule. He drew the Infinity Wars limited series in 2018 with writer Gerry Duggan. in March 2019 Deodato announced that he would leave Marvel after his upcoming run on Savage Avengers. Deodato said \\"When I was a boy I dreamt to one day become a Marvel artist.

It is on the Hallam and Penistone Lines, both operated by Northern Trains. It is a railway station. Earlier history A 1912 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing (left) railways in the vicinity of Barnsley. The present station is shown here as L&Y; STA, on the line coloured blue. The Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley, Wakefield, Huddersfield & Goole Railway was formed in 1846 with the aim of providing access to the South Yorkshire coalfield. It was to link the Manchester and Leeds Railway (M&LR;) near Horbury, with the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway near , by way of Barnsley. Whilst the railway was still at the planning stage, it was split in two at Barnsley, the northern portion being leased to the M&LR; and the southern to the South Yorkshire, Doncaster & Goole Railway (SYD&G;). The northern section opened first, and Barnsley station was opened with the line on 1 January 1850. The route of the southern section was changed, and instead, is connected to the SYD&G; line near . This section opened on 1 July 1851, and Barnsley then became a through station, although the two sections of line were operated by different railways. On 1 July 1854, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) opened a line from to Barnsley. Each of these railway companies went through various takeovers and amalgamations, until the early 20th century, when the station at Barnsley was co-owned by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR, successor to the M&LR;), and the Great Central Railway (GCR, successor to the MS&LR; and SYD&G;). At the 1923 grouping, the GCR became part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER), whilst the LYR formed part of the new London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), as did the Midland Railway (MR). The LYR and MR each contributed one station in Barnsley to the LMS, and since the ex-MR station was already distinguished as , the LMS renamed the former LYR station to Barnsley Low Town on 2 June 1924. Just two months later, on 1 August 1924, it was again renamed, this time to Barnsley Exchange. Barnsley Court House station closed on 19 April 1960, following the commissioning of a new chord line south of the town near Quarry Junction that linked the former SYR route down the Blackburn Valley with the ex-Midland Railway line from Sheffield Midland, allowing services on the latter route to serve the station (and continue northwards to Wakefield & Leeds). Subsequently, on 13 June 1960, Barnsley Exchange was renamed Barnsley. South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive rebuilt the station in 2007 to improve interchange with bus services, and the redesign won a Civic Building award. Facilities Station sign The station is fully staffed throughout the day, with the booking office open from 06:00 to 19:30 Mondays to Saturdays and from 08:45 to 19:00 on Sundays. There are several self-service ticket machines provided for use outside these times and for collecting advance purchase tickets, located on the platform 2 side of the foot-bridge, and outside the ticket office. In the main building on platform 1, there is a waiting room and toilets. A separate waiting room (with vending machines for drinks and snacks) is located on platform 2, with a fully accessible footbridge (equipped with lifts) linking them; there is step-free access from the entrance and bus station to all platforms. Train running information is provided by automated announcements, digital display screens and timetable posters. There are a number of shops a short walk over the footbridge to the bus station, these include a newsagents, Lloyds Pharmacy, Coopland Bakery and a Subway restaurant. In popular culture In 2013 it was used as a filming location in Channel 4's cult drama series Utopia. Barnsley Interchange rail services The station platforms in 1998. Rail services operate frequently through Barnsley Interchange station. On the Hallam line during the day from Monday to Saturday, there are three trains per hour northbound bound to . Two are express services, calling only at Wakefield Kirkgate en route to Leeds whilst the third is an all-stations local that runs via . On Sundays, the service reduces to one express service and one stopping service to Leeds each hour. Two northbound Sunday services from Nottingham to Leeds extend to via the Settle-Carlisle Line. On the Penistone line, there is an hourly service northbound to Huddersfield, now provided seven days a week. Southbound there are four trains per hour (2 fast and 2 stopping). Two of these services terminate at Sheffield whilst one fast train carries on to Nottingham and the other fast service runs through to Lincoln Central (now laying foundations for the Northern Connect service, cutting out all stops between Sheffield and Worksop to reduce journey times). The service drops to three per hour (one fast & two stopping) on Sundays. From the near future, the to via and will transfer to the new Northern Connect brand, using brand new trains with WiFi. Furthermore, services to will also be cut from Barnsley, this service will join Northern Connect and operate a new route via Wakefield Westgate with less stops on the Erewash Valley Line. Northern Trains have stated that the frequency of express services between and via Barnsley will be maintained when the Nottingham service ends. In May 1999, Midland Mainline commenced a daily weekday service to London St Pancras. The service was withdrawn by East Midlands Trains on 5 September 2008. Barnsley Interchange bus services The new Barnsley Interchange was opened on 20 May 2007 by Secretary of State for Transport Douglas Alexander. The new building forms the entire new complex of Barnsley Interchange. Rail and bus users exit the interchange via the new car park or, for the town centre, the new entrance and exit is on Eldon Street. It has 21 stands, with 3 coach stands. The bus station features the latest in technology such as the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive scheme of \\"Your Next Bus\\", tracking buses with GPS to check what time they are due to arrive and depart. Several shops occupy retail units within the interchange, including Lloyd's Pharmacy, GT News, Cowpuccino Espresso Bar, Cooplands and a Subway. Work has since been completed on the link road, Schwäbisch Gmünd Way (formerly Interchange Way), which was renamed in honour of Barnsley's twin town in Germany. That enables buses to enter or leave the Interchange quickly, without having to use the busy level crossing at Jumble Lane. Stagecoach Yorkshire operate most of the services from the Interchange, and Waterson's also operating services from the station. Stagecoach operate local routes throughout Barnsley and also to Wakefield, Pontefract, Doncaster, Rotherham, Sheffield and Leeds. Local routes go as far north as Woolley and as far south as Elsecar.

The name Deseado comes from the English Desire, the name of one of the two ships commanded by John Davis during the Thomas Cavendish expedition of 1592. The river is born from the glacier-thaw Buenos Aires Lake on the northwestern part of the province at the Andes range, and travels for before reaching the Atlantic Coast. On its way southeast, its water is tapped for irrigation. Its tributaries include the Pinturas River and the Fénix River. The river sometimes disappears under the arid terrain, to re- emerge before reaching Puerto Deseado on Santa Cruz's coastline, where it produces a deep-water natural port. The outlet of the river has become submerged and inundated by sea water, forming an estuary. In 1977, this was set aside as a nature reserve, the Reserva Natural Ría Deseado.

They are led by a boy known only as N and the Seven Sages who will capture Zekrom and Reshiram (depending on the game version), intending to use the Dragon Pokémon to force people to abandon capturing Pokémon. In reality, N is a pawn used by his adoptive father Ghetsis, one of the Seven Sages, who raised him for the sole purpose of being able to tame the legendary Pokémon and then disposing of him, so that he can take control of Unova. * Ghetsis (): Ghetsis is the true leader of Team Plasma, and N's father, having raised the boy to serve as a charismatic leader while secretly running the true operations of the group behind the boy's back. For much of Black and White, he presents himself as a seemingly benevolent, well-meaning figure, but is steadily hinted at - and ultimately revealed as - the main villain of both sets of games and the main antagonist, rather than N. When N was only a child, Ghetsis kept him away from humans and closer to abused Pokémon, so that he would later develop resentment against humans who live side by side with their Pokémon and not realise how many good people actually existed. Because of this, Ghetsis was able to easily manipulate N into believing that he would be the \\"hero\\" that would help free all the Pokémon world from their owners. Afterwards, it is implied that Ghetsis planned to get rid of N once he had accomplished his mission: becoming the sole controller of Unova's Pokémon and using them as an army to conquer the entire world and rule it as a dictator. However, the actions of the player - who has helped inspire N to see beyond his old views - lead to N's defeat. This infuriates Ghetsis, who reveals his true colors and attempts of complete world domination to stop the player himself. After his defeat he begins losing his mind, but retains enough clarity to escape with the help of his loyal servants, the Shadow Triad. His full name is . * The : The high-ranking members of Team Plasma. Throughout the course of the gameplay, the player encounters each of the sages but will not be able to battle them. After the defeat of N and before becoming the Pokémon Champion, the player must locate all of the Sages scattered throughout the Unova region. Ghetsis is the leader of the Seven Sages. The other Sages consist of: Zinzolin (): Associated with the color purple. Despite claiming to dislike the cold, he can be found in Cold Storage after defeating Ghetsis. He seems to specialize in Ice-Types.  Ryoku (): Associated with the color green.  : Associated with the color yellow.  Rood (): Associated with the color red. He returns in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2 as part of the old Team Plasma, and is battled at their warehouse in Driftveil City. He seems to specialize in the Normal Type. He entrusts N's Zorua into the player's care, and assists the player at the Giant Chasm against Ghetsis' faction.  Bronius (): Associated with the color brown.  Gorm (): Associated with the color blue. * The Shadow Triad (): Three ninja-like young men who are Ghetsis's faithful servants because he once saved their lives. They have the ability to teleport, and usually \\"escort\\" the player to N or Ghetsis. After Ghetsis's defeat and arrest (and later unexplained break-out), the Shadow Triad appears one last time on the Marvelous Bridge, where they explain that Ghetsis ordered them to bring the player the 3 Orbs of Dialga, Palkia and Giratina (Adamant, Lustrous and Griseous, respectively) and that despite their loyalty to him, he has ordered them to not look for him. The Shadow Triad were once rumored to be the Striaton City Gym Leaders Cilan, Cress, and Chili. * : N is the king and leader of Team Plasma. He is a very mysterious trainer who shows up at random and inconvenient times and believes that all humans and Pokémon should be separated. He is almost always seen using Pokémon that can only be found in the area that he is fought in. He was forced to grow up with abused Pokémon, as a plot by his adoptive father, Ghetsis, so that he would want to liberate all Pokémon from humans. By following through with the plan, he captures either Zekrom in Black or Reshiram in White (the player will capture the opposite colored one) in order to show the world his power so that they will follow through with his plan to liberate all Pokémon. N returns in Black 2 and White 2 in a supporting role, enabling the games' mascot Kyurem to transform into its iconic form for the game version. In the end game, N can be challenged, using his legendary Pokémon from the previous game, and upon defeat the Dragon transforms into a Key Item the player can use to capture the Dragon himself or herself. After another in-game event, N becomes a character the player can challenge on a monthly basis, with the team changing with the games' seasonal cycle. His full name is . * Anthea (the ) and Concordia (the ): Two characters who appear towards the end of the main story of Black and White who serve N. Concordia tells the player the story of N and how Ghetsis raised him, while Anthea heals the player's Pokémon in preparation for the final battle against N. They can also be seen in the game's first opening sequence where they watch as N is crowned as the king of Team Plasma by Ghetsis. It was revealed that Anthea and Concordia are N's foster Sisters. They appear in Black 2 and White 2 in Rood's Pokémon volunteer house in Driftveil City, where they tell the player of Ghetsis' ambitions and what he did to further them, as well as N's early childhood before Ghetsis found him. According to them, N had spent this part of his life in a forest with a Darmanitan and a Zorua (the latter of which can be acquired from Rood) as he had distressed people with an unusual ability to commune with Pokémon. * : A scientist that was researching Genesect for Team Plasma. * : The underlings of Team Plasma. =Neo Team Plasma= Neo Team Plasma is the antagonistic group in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2. They intending to use the power of Kyurem to take over the Unova Region and the rest of the world. * Ghetsis (): Ghetsis returns as the true leader of Neo Team Plasma, despite using Colress as a proxy leader to conceal its own identity. When met, he will state that Kyurem is an empty shell, and that he will pour his ambitions into that shell. He uses the Legendary Pokémon to freeze Unova and its people, with the ultimate goal of conquer the world with its great power. In Giant Chasm, he will command Kyurem to freeze the player alive with the Pokémon's signature move, Glaciate, but will be stopped by N. Unfortunately, he predicted that N's love for Pokémon will lead him to Kyurem and then merges Kyurem and Zekrom (Black 2) or Reshiram (White 2) to create Black Kyurem (Black 2) or White Kyurem (White 2), respectively. After Black/White Kyurem is defeated, Ghetsis then challenges the player to a battle. After losing, he loses the last of his sanity and the Shadow Triad move him away - later revealing that his mind has completely broken from the shock of his failures. * Zinzolin (): Zinzolin returns under Ghetsis' Neo Team Plasma, and battles the player at several points in the game. He is a specialist in Ice-type Pokémon, which is odd for someone who does not like the cold. * The Shadow Triad (): The Shadow Triad returns in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2, and battles the player several times in the game. They are also revealed to possess a Liepard which had evolved from a Purrloin which was stolen from the rival character's younger sister five years earlier, leading him to foster a deep hatred for the organization. At first, this includes Rood's faction as well. After Team Plasma disbands, the Triad remains at Icirrus City, where they can be challenged on a monthly basis. Using the Unova Link Function unlocks a cutscene involving Cilan, Chili, and Cress fighting against The Shadow Triad (and losing) - thus disbanding the rumors that the two groups are one and the same. * Colress (): Colress is an independent Pokémon researcher and the leader of Neo Team Plasma, who works to learn about the powers of Pokémon and tries to bring out the true strength within them. He battles the player several times throughout the game to test the player's ability and the power of the player's Pokémon. He eventually aligns with Team Plasma, as they will allow him to study Pokémon the way he wishes. After Team Plasma is defeated, again, he helps the group reform their ways. He can then be battled at the P2 Laboratory. He returns in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, giving the player the means to fuse Necrozma with Solgaleo/Lunana once they catch the former and helping the player and their allies in defeating Team Rainbow Rocket in the post-game story. He has a larger antagonistic role in the anime, as he is building a device that would allow Ghetsis to control Reshiram, and he takes control of various Pokémon, including Team Rocket's Meowth, in an effort to fine tune it. He specializes in Steel-Type Pokémon. * Neo Team Plasma Grunts: The underlings of Neo Team Plasma. =Team Flare= is the evil team appearing in Pokémon X and Y. Their main goal is to \\"create a beautiful world\\", which eventually manifests itself into mass genocide of all human and Pokémon life but themselves, using an ancient weapon once used by a king of Kalos, an ancestor of their leader Lysandre, from 3000 years ago. While their plan involved harnessing the power of Xerneas and Yveltal (depending the game's version), Team Flare's scheme in the anime involves controlling Zygarde and the sundial as their weapon of holocaust * Lysandre (): The leader of Team Flare, seeking to attain eternal beauty. He follows the player's progress closely, seeking the player in his plans, and revealing the history of Kalos and the king AZ, his ancestor, who nearly wiped out all life. After his identity as Team Flare's leader is revealed, he admits that he wishes to use his ancestor's weapon to enact a mass extinction, believing the Mega Ring to be central to his plans. The player ultimately defeats Lysandre, and when Lysandre attempts to activate the weapon, despite the player having captured its power source Xerneas (X)/Yveltal (Y), the weapon crumbles and destroys the headquarters. Although the player and his/her friends, as well as most of the members of Team Flare, manage to escape, Lysandre is never seen escaping the destruction, therefore he is presumed dead. In the anime, using Lysandre Labs as a front, Lysandre manipulates Alain to provide him with Mega Evolution while his subordinates managed to capture the blue-core Zygarde in his plan to control both Zygarde Cores while destroying Lumoise City as a display of Team Flare's power. But after losing to Ash, Alain, and a redeemed Malva, as well as losing both Zygarde Cores, Lysandre resorts to using a Zygarde fabrication created from the Megalith and have it absorb the energies of the Anistar sundial to invoke a global genocide. But the Zygarde Cores assume their 100% form to destroy the fabrication, with Lysandre seemingly killed in the process. * Team Flare scientists: The scientists of Team Flare.

He is the group's head scientist, leading the building of the ultimate weapon. In the post-game, he also creates the Expansion Suit and hires Emma to be its user. At the end of the post game, he is arrested by Looker. * Malva, member of the Kalos Elite Four, is a former member of Team Flare. * : The admins of Team Flare.  : A Butler who is a former Team Flare Admin. * : The underlings of Team Flare. =Aether Foundation= The Aether Foundation is an organization appearing in Pokémon Sun and Moon seemingly dedicated to the conservation of Pokémon. However, it is revealed that they are also researching the Ultra Beasts and while they are not technically a criminal syndicate, their president sought to harness the power of Cosmog to bring the Ultra Beasts into Alola (in the original games)/travel to Ultra Megalopolis to battle Necrozma (in the Ultra versions) with no regard for the consequences of doing so. * : The leader of the Aether Foundation, the mother of Lillie and Gladion, and the real villain of the original Sun and Moon games. She is obsessed with the Ultra Beasts, specifically the Nihilego species having fallen under their influence; Gladion speculates her fixation started after her husband vanished while studying them. She went as far as unleashing them upon Alola by overclocking Nebby's power before wanting to live a solitary life amongst the Nihilego in their home realm. She then ends up allowing herself to be taken over by a Nihilego at the games' climax in a last-ditch attempt to destroy the heroes (making her the only villain in the franchise whose final battle is fought against as a mutant version of themselves). While she is now living in Kanto to have the last of the Nihilego poison removed from her and trying to rebuild her relationship with Lillie, her ultimate fate in the original games remains unknown. However it is implied that she is now wanted by the International Police for her actions against Alola while she was possessed. The Ultra versions depict her in a completely different light; devoid of Nihilego's influence and therefore her Ultra Beast obsession, believing she's doing the right thing, working also with the Ultra Recon Squad and harnessing Nebby's power so that she can fight Necrozma, but is defeated easily by the stealer of light. She reforms at the end, giving her children the independence she had denied them for so long and choosing not to directly interfere with their lives anymore, but is captured by Team Rainbow Rocket and taken hostage in the post-game. After Team Rainbow Rocket's defeat, she then appears as a possible Title Defense challenger at the start of every month, a role previously taken by Faba (see below) * : The Aether Foundation's admin. He challenges the player multiple times to stop the player when Lillie gets kidnapped. In the original games, he also appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense, appearing every start of the month, having been demoted from his position of Branch Chief. In the post-game story of the Ultra versions, he betrays the Aether Foundation to Team Rainbow Rocket for his own benefit. Because of this, he is demoted to the position of intern following Giovanni's defeat, with Lusamine taking his place in Title Defense in these games. * : The vice-chief of the Aether Foundation. Unlike the other two, she helps the player attempt to stop Lusamine's plans. She also appears in the post-game, helping the player with the Ultra Beast mission in the original versions. * Aether Foundation employees: The employees of the Aether Foundation. Team Skull is a gang of street thugs who are the resident villain team of Alola, secretly working with the Aether Foundation on the promise of money.

He at one point went through the Island Challenge, but did not meet the criteria to become a Captain. He has history with Professor Kukui.

After that, he appears as a possible Title Defense challenger. * : Plumeria is Team Skull's admin and helps to keep the team in order. She cares for the grunts beneath her, making her less antagonistic than previous admins. She appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense. * : This young man lends his strength to Team Skull as an enforcer. He places a high value on being strong in Pokémon battles. His partner Pokémon is the mysterious Type: Null, which eventually evolves into Silvally. He is Lusamine's son and Lillie's brother. He also appears as a possible fighter in Title Defense and in the Ultra versions leaves Alola post- game to travel to other regions to become stronger; he appears as a Title Defense challenger after a month has passed in those games. * : The underlings of Team Skull. =Team Rainbow Rocket= is the crime syndicate in the side-quest of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon.

It is interesting to note that almost all Pokémon Professors are named after trees or plants: Oak, Ivy, Elm, Birch, Rowan, Juniper, Sycamore, Kukui, Magnolia, Willow or Bellis. * Professor Samuel Oak (): A Pokémon researcher and the grandfather of Blue/the rival in Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, FireRed, and LeafGreen. He is often considered the leading Pokémon expert, often giving lectures to Pokémon academies and hosting a radio show in Goldenrod City, and specializes in Pokémon behavioral science. Alongside his research, he is also authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Kanto starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Squirtle, and Charmander. In the anime, he gives Ash his Pikachu after Ash arrives too late to receive one of the usual three starter Pokémon. In Pokémon Yellow: Special Pikachu Edition, he simply gives the player a Pikachu after the rival takes the Eevee that Oak intended to give the player. He is a master Pokémon poet. All Pokémon he \\"baby-sits\\" are loyal to him, and he had a Charmeleon as a young boy. In Pokémon 4Ever, it is shown that he traveled forward in time to the future when he was a boy, and Ash became friends with him. When Ash tells Professor Oak about him, he replies that he is sure that \\"Sammy\\" will always be his friend, even though Misty later realizes that Ash never told him his name; the current Professor Oak is later seen looking through a book of old drawings he made as a kid (the predecessor to the Pokédex, which he invented with the other professors). * Dr. Mason (): A Pokémon card researcher in Pokémon Trading Card Game and Pokémon Card GB2: Here Comes Great Team Rocket!. * Professor Felina Ivy (): A Pokémon researcher. She is the leading researcher in the Orange Islands. In the anime, she gives Ash the GS Ball to deliver to Kurt, which eventually leads him to the Johto region.

In Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, he is authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Johto starter Pokémon: Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. He is also credited as discovering that Pikachu is an evolved Pokémon. In the Pokémon anime, Jessie, James and Meowth temporarily steal a Totodile from him, (in reality he tells them to take it, thinking they are Nurse Joy). His 'absent minded professor' stereotype is even more pronounced in the games as he often forgets to visit his family and his wife worries that he may not remember to eat. He specializes in research regarding Pokémon breeding and is credited with the discovery of Pokémon eggs. * Professor Birch (): A Pokémon researcher, known for his fieldwork and research on Pokémon habitual distribution. In Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire, he is authorized by the Pokémon League to give new Pokémon trainers one of the three Hoenn starter Pokémon: Treecko, Torchic, and Mudkip.

In the game, she leaves a present at the player's house containing starter Pokémon for the player and the player's rivals, Bianca and Cheren. In the anime, she gives Trip a Snivy and allows Ash to keep an Oshawott that escapes from her lab. Her father, Cedric Juniper, was also a Pokémon Professor and has since retired; in the games, he upgrades the player's Pokédex to the National mode after the player defeats N and Ghetsis. * : A professor who appears in the 3DS application Pokémon Dream Radar, she studies the space that lies between dreams and reality.

She was the only child of Przemysł II, Duke of Greater Poland (since 1295 King of Poland) and his second wife Richeza, herself a daughter of ex-King Valdemar of Sweden and Sofia of Denmark. Life =Early Years= Born in Poznań, Ryksa was the only child born from her parents' marriage. She was named after her mother, who died after her birth, although the exact date is unknown (probably between 1289-1292). During her first years of life, she was raised by her paternal aunt Anna in the Cistercian monastery in Owińska, where she was the abbess. It was probably there that Ryksa received the news of her father's failed kidnapping and murder on 8 February 1296 in Rogoźno. The death of the Polish King completely changed the geopolitical situation in this part of Europe, and also clearly influenced the fate of the now orphaned young princess, who was now placed under the care of her stepmother Margaret of Brandenburg, member of the House of Ascania (who took part in the conspiracy to kill Przemysł II). During the marriage ceremony of Przemysł II and Margaret (bef. 13 April 1293), Ryksa was betrothed to Otto of Brandenburg-Salzwedel (Margaret's brother),A. Swieżawski: Przemysł. Król Polski, Warszawa 2006, p. 152. so her stepmother was also her future sister-in-law. Although Margaret received parts of Greater Poland as her dower, shortly after her husband's death, and for unknown reasons, she returned to Brandenburg, taking Ryksa with her. Otto's unexpected death on 11 March 1299 ended the betrothal and Ryksa returned to Greater Poland. =Engagement and marriage with Wenceslaus II= The death of Otto of Brandenburg complicated again Ryksa's situation, because as the only child of the last male member of the Piast Greater Poland line and the first King in almost two centuries, she was the perfect match for every contender to the Polish crown. For this, when King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia (a widower since 1297) received from the lords of Greater Poland the offer of marriage with the princess, he didn't think too much, and even before his own coronation as King of Poland on 25 July 1300 in Gniezno, Ryksa was sent to Prague. Because of her youth, Wenceslaus II decided to delay the wedding until Ryksa was fifteen years old. During this time, she was placed under the care of Gryfina of Halych, widow of Leszek II the Black and aunt of the Bohemian King. The marriage between Ryksa and Wenceslaus II took place on 26 May 1303 in Prague Cathedral. During the ceremony, Ryksa was crowned Queen consort of Bohemia and Poland, and at the request of her husband, she adopted the name Elisabeth, because her name was not used in Bohemia and seen as strange. The ceremony was performed with the consent of the Archbishops of Mainz and Gniezno and the Bishop of Wrocław, Henryk z Wierzbnej. Two years later, on 15 June 1305, Queen Elizabeth gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Agnes. Only six days later, on 21 June, King Wenceslaus II died in Prague, probably of tuberculosis. The seventeen-year-old Elizabeth, now Queen Dowager, received several lands as her dowry and 20,000 pieces of fine silver. =Short government of Wenceslaus III. Marriage with Rudolph of Habsburg= Elizabeth's stepson Wenceslaus III (also a claimant to the throne of Hungary) succeeded to the thrones of both Bohemia and Poland but was murdered on 4 August 1306 in Olomouc, and with him the Přemyslid dynasty became extinct. The Kujavian branch of the Piast dynasty ascended to the Polish throne. With the death of her stepson, the position of Elizabeth again changed considerably, because as Queen Dowager, she was involved in the fight for the vacant Bohemian throne. Duke Rudolph III of Austria and Styria, son of King Albert I of Germany, finally could take the crown thanks to his father's help. In order to strengthen his position, he arranged his marriage to Elizabeth, both widow and stepmother of the last two Premyslid Kings. The marriage took place in Prague on 16 October 1306; however, Elizabeth's second time as Queen consort was short-lived: King Rudolph died on 4 July 1307 of dysentery after becoming ill during the siege of the fortress of a nobleman in revolt. In his will, Rudolph acknowledged Elizabeth's dowry towns and left her an additional 20,000 pieces of fine silver. =Rule over Hradec Králové= After her second husband's death, Elizabeth left Prague and settled in Hradec Králové, one of her dower towns, which became the center of her domains. However, soon after, she was again involved in the civil war for the Bohemian crown, this time between Henry of Carinthia and Frederick I of Austria, Rudolph's brother. In the fight, Elizabeth strongly supported her brother-in-law; for this, she was forced to flee from her lands, which were occupied by Henry. It was only in August 1308 when the Dowager Queen was able to return to Hradec Králové, which she transformed into a center of culture and art. =Relationship with Henry of Lipá. Conflicts with John of Luxembourg= In 1310 John of Luxembourg became the new King of Bohemia, thanks to his marriage to Elizabeth, daughter of King Wenceslaus II and his first wife. John's rule faced substantial opposition from Bohemian nobles, who decided to support Ryksa-Elizabeth. One of the main reasons for Ryksa-Elizabeth's opposition was her wounded pride, for now she was degraded in status because of the new Queen consort, her own stepdaughter. The second important leader of the anti-Luxembourg faction was the powerful nobleman Jindřich of Lipá (Henry of Lipá), who was the Moravian Hetman and Governor of the Bohemian Kingdom in the absence of the King. Soon a romantic relationship developed between Ryksa-Elizabeth and Henry of Lipá, which, for political reasons, never led to marriage. (This was not only due to the difference in their status, but also because a marriage with the Dowager Queen would give Henry of Lipá claims to the throne.) In order to weaken the position of the powerful nobility, in 1315, King John deprived Henry of all his offices and imprisoned him. However, the position and popularity of the Dowager Queen was so strong in Bohemia that John, fearing a civil war, released him in April 1316. =Alliance with Henry I of Jawor. Peace with King John of Bohemia and sale of Hradec Králové= Despite her conciliatory gestures toward King John, Ryksa-Elizabeth continued to dictate her own independent policies, as was evidenced in 1317, when she arranged the betrothal of her only daughter, Agnes, to the Piast Silesian Duke Henry I of Jawor, who in order to secure his future mother-in-law's patrimony and with her consent, entered Hradec Králové with his army and began expeditions in support of rebels against King John. However, one year later, and thanks to the mediation of Emperor Louis IV (Henry I's brother-in-law) a peace treaty was signed in Domažlice, which restored Henry of Lipá in King John's favor and regained for him all of his previous offices. In addition, the Dowager Queen sold her dowry towns to King John and settled with her lover in Brno. Afterward, the relations between the Bohemia King John and Ryksa-Elizabeth were peaceful, to the point that a certain weakness could be interpreted by King John's actions, made evident in his approval of grants to the Cistercian convent in Moravia in response to the request of the Dowager Queen. The formal marriage between Agnes and Henry I of Jawor took place in 1319; after a miscarriage some time later, the couple remained childless. =Death of Henry of Lipá. Ryksa-Elizabeth became a nun. Last Years= basilika in Old Brno Henry of Lipá died in Brno on 26 August 1329. After his loss, Ryksa-Elizabeth took the veil in the local convent, which she had generously endowed, and turned her attention to culture and religion, building churches and Cistercian convents, and financing the crafting of illuminated hymn books. Four years later, and together with her daughter Agnes, she went on a long pilgrimage to the shrines of the Rhine, returning a few months later. Ryksa-Elizabeth, Dowager Queen of Poland and Bohemia (known in Bohemian literature as a \\"beautiful Polish girl\\"), died on 19 October 1335 in the local Cistercian monastery at Brno and, according to her wishes, was buried under the floor of her cloister church - Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, Brno, next to her beloved Henry of Lipá. In her will she made several donations to ecclesiastical institutions in both Bohemia and Poland (especially in Poznań, her birthplace).

The Santa Cruz begins at the shore of the Viedma and Argentino Lakes, of glacial origin and located in the Los Glaciares National Park, and runs eastwards before reaching the Atlantic Coast, north of the southern tip of South America, creating a delta. It is one of the last large free-flowing rivers in Patagonia. Dams The river has an important flow of on average, and is used for irrigation. Two dams are planned for the river, the Jorge Cepernic and Nestor Kirchner Dams. They will have a combined installed capacity of 1,740 MW. Contracts to construct the dams were awarded to a consortium of Chinese and domestic companies in August 2013. It is estimated that the dams will destroy over half of the Santa Cruz River ecosystem.  History  Santa Cruz River was “discovered“ by Europeans during Magellan's circumnavigation of the Earth, by Juan Serrano, captain of the Santiago, one of the ships of the Magellan fleet, by August 5, 1520. After learning of the favourable conditions that Serrano found at Santa Cruz, Ferdinand Magellan decided to move the fleet there from St. Julian, where they had stopped to overwinter, around August 24. They would spend six weeks at Santa Cruz before resuming their search for the strait that would link the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, now called the Magellan Strait. By the start of April 1834, had reached a stage in its survey voyage where minor repairs were needed to its keel and copper sheathing, so Captain Robert FitzRoy chose the river as a suitable place to lay the ship ashore. While this work was carried out, FitzRoy led an expedition upriver with aim of finding its source, distant in the Andes. Three boats set out on April 18, carrying twenty-five men, including FitzRoy and naturalist Charles Darwin. All involved took turn in teams dragging the boats up river for 16 days. Darwin took careful note of everything, including the terrain around the river the flora and fauna of the region, and the geology exposed as the river cut through the plains. > April 22nd. -- The country remained the same, and was extremely > uninteresting. The complete similarity of the productions throughout > Patagonia is one of its most striking characters. The level plains of arid > shingle support the same stunted and dwarf plants; and in the valleys the > same thorn-bearing bushes grow. Everywhere we see the same birds and > insects. Even the very banks of the river and of the clear streamlets which > entered it, were scarcely enlivened by a brighter tint of green. The curse > of sterility is on the land, and the water flowing over a bed of pebbles > partakes of the same curse. Hence the number of waterfowl is very scanty; > for there is nothing to support life in the stream of this barren river. At the outset of the voyage, FitzRoy had given Darwin the first volume of Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology, which used the uniformitarian paradigm that the key to the past is the present and that led to the interpretation of present geology in the light of slow and gradual processes. Darwin was greatly impressed by the series of stepped plains of pebbles which would have formed over long periods in the sea, and went against Lyell's ideas of continuous gradual development by implying an intermittent process. When Darwin described this in his book on South America's geology, he wrote \\"I think we must admit, that within the recent period, the course of the Santa Cruz formed a sea- strait intersecting the continent. At this period, the southern part of South America consisted of an archipelago of islands\\".http://darwin- online.org.uk/EditorialIntroductions/Chancellor_fieldNotebooks1.9.html In his Journal of researches, p. 218, Darwin criticised the catastrophism proposed by former geologists who, in trying to explain the erosion of the lava and other rocks of the valley, > \\"....would have brought into play, the violent action of some overwhelming > debacle; but in [the case of the Santa Cruz] such a supposition would have > been quite inadmissible; because the same step-like terraces, that front the > Patagonian coast, sweep up on each side of the valley.

The 716 cabins range in size from in size from , of which 197 have a balcony. Zaandam has a musical theme, and is decorated with artefacts and memorabilia from different musical genres, such as a Baroque-style Dutch pipe organ and guitars signed by the Rolling Stones, Carlos Santana and Queen. One of the centre stairways has a saxophone signed by former United States President Bill Clinton on the mouthpiece. Construction and career The cruise ship was constructed by Fincantieri Cantieri Navali Italiana SpA at Marghera, Italy with the yard number 6036 and the keel was laid down on 26 June 1998. The vessel was launched on 29 April 1999 and completed on 6 April 2000. Zaandam was christened by Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen in May 2000. The ship is registered in the Netherlands and owned and operated by the Holland America Line. Zaandam currently sails through Canada and New England during the summer and during the winter sails Mexico and Hawaii. In December and January, Zaandam cruises the Antarctic and South America. On 24 June 2018, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 73 people became ill on Zaandam in a norovirus outbreak en voyage from Seattle, Washington to Alaska. =Coronavirus pandemic= On 7 March 2020 Zaandam departed Buenos Aires, Argentina, sailing for San Antonio, Chile with 1,243 passengers and 586 crew. By 14 March, 13 passengers and over 100 crew members had fallen ill with \\"flu-like symptoms.\\". She became stranded off the coast of Chile after being denied entry. By 24 March, the vessel was sailing for Port Everglades, a cruise-liner port in Florida, United States. The number of sick people aboard had risen to 77. Holland America dispatched sister ship to aid the ship by bringing supplies, additional medical staff, and COVID-19 tests, and also with the intention of transferring healthy passengers onto Rotterdam. On 27 March, Zaandam was denied transit through the Panama Canal due to the number of sick people on board. Four passengers died while waiting for permission to transit the Panama Canal with the number of sick aboard climbing to 148. On 28 March 2020, Zaandam and Rotterdam were cleared by the Panama Department of Health to transit the Panama Canal. Some passengers from Zaandam transferred to the Rotterdam. Rotterdam followed Zaandam through the Panama Canal on her way to Port Everglades, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At that time, the crew of Zaandam included four physicians and four nurses while Rotterdams roster included two physicians and four nurses. By 31 March 2020, the number reported as being \\"ill\\" had increased to 193. Rotterdam had taken almost 1,400 symptom- free people from Zaandam, leaving 450 passengers and 602 crew members on her sister ship. As of 30 March 2020, Holland America had not received permission to dock either vessel at Fort Lauderdale as planned. Associated Press reported that the city's mayor, Dean Trantalis, \\"said he didn't want the ship to dock near his city, at least without extensive precautions.\\" The Florida state governor was also hesitant to accept Zaandam at Fort Lauderdale, and declined to make a decision on 31 March 2020. The president of Holland America made a public plea for acceptance of the ship and expressed concern that various ports in several countries had been reluctant to provide provisions and medical supplies. In a 30 March press conference, the state governor suggested that the best solution might be to send medical assistance to the ship. On 1 April, the governor announced that only residents of Florida could disembark when the ship arrived. 190 passengers and crew reported \\"flu-like\\" symptoms and eight had tested positive for COVID-19. US President Donald Trump said on 1 April 2020 that \\"we have to help the people\\" [on the ships] and that discussions were under way with Canada and the United Kingdom about them \\"arranging flights to retrieve their citizens from the ship.\\" After the ship was allowed to dock, nine passengers were taken to local hospitals, but 45 others who were ill were required to remain on board, receiving medical care, until they fully met \\"the CDC guidelines for being fit to travel.\\" Crew from both ship were not permitted to disembark. The cruise line sought to arrange for passengers from other countries to leave Florida on chartered aircraft. By 4 April, \\"14 critically ill people\\" were admitted to local hospitals, while the others were allowed to disembark when flights to their destinations were available. A fourth person, one of the crew, died in hospital on 10 April.

Vertical cross-section of New Orleans, showing maximum levee height of 23 feet. Hurricane preparedness in New Orleans has been an issue since the city's early settlement because of its location. New Orleans was built on a marsh. Unlike the first two centuries of its existence, today a little under half of the modern city sits below sea level. The city is surrounded by the Mississippi River, Lake Pontchartrain to the north, and Lake Borgne on the east. The earliest-settled parts of New Orleans and surrounding communities are above sea level. However, flooding was long a threat, from the periodic high waters of the Mississippi and from more occasional severe tropical storms which pushed the waters of Lake Pontchartrain into settled areas. Construction of the levees along the River began soon after the city was founded, and more extensive river levees were built as the city grew. These earthen barriers were erected to prevent damage caused by seasonal Mississippi River flooding. The Lake Pontchartrain shore was mostly undeveloped swamp, and only small levees were built there in the 19th century. Colonial era Awareness of the city's vulnerability to hurricanes dates back to the early Colonial era. A major hurricane hit the city in September 1722, leveling many of the buildings in the young city. 1794 was perhaps as dreadful a year as the city of New Orleans ever experienced, as it suffered two hurricanes in addition to a major fire. 19th century hurricanes The 19th century saw such hurricanes as the 1856 Last Island Hurricane and the 1893 Chenière Caminada hurricane, which were devastating. The 19th century hurricanes were not nearly as media-covered, but they were still just as devastating as hurricanes are today. In this era, the news was not advanced enough to give minute by minute storm coverage. The 1856 Last Island Hurricane was the first major hurricane in the Atlantic hurricane season. Media coverage and storm identification were not at the stage to update the citizens of the area, so New Orleans and Last Island got completely decimated, and in turn got hit rather unexpectedly. Last Island ended up as a group of fragmented islands rather than a single one-completely destroying homes and families. The Chenière Caminada Hurricane of October 1893 also had a lasting impact whose wreckage was hard to prepare for. This natural disaster destroyed the island known as Chenière Caminada and about half the inhabitants were killed because of this disaster. Both of these islands were some of the earliest known islands in Louisiana. Early 20th century hurricanes 1909 saw the Grand Isle hurricane hit the city. There was major flooding in the \\"back of town\\" area and in the undeveloped swamps north of town. The 1915 New Orleans hurricane, or as it was called locally, \\"the Great Storm of 1915\\" struck with more wind damage than the 1909 storm. Flooding was more limited in scope and duration due to improved drainage pumping. However, Lake Pontchartrain rose to a higher level than previously recorded, overtopping some of the back levees. The Sewage and Water Board recommended taller levees to protect the city from flooding on the lake side. A much larger project to build up levees along the lake and extend the shoreline out by dredging began in 1927. As the city grew, there was increased pressure to develop lower-lying areas. A large system of canals and pumps was constructed to drain the land. Flooding containment efforts until the mid-20th century primarily focused on floods from the Mississippi River. In 1947, the Fort Lauderdale hurricane struck the New Orleans area. There was moderate wind damage. Flood prevention was largely successful in Orleans Parish, but there was severe flooding in the new East Jefferson suburbs near the Lake. Late 20th century hurricanes Hurricanes of Category 3 or greater passing within 100 miles of New Orleans 1852–2005. from NOAA Hurricane Flossy in 1956 resulted in flooding in parts of Eastern New Orleans. Hurricane Betsy in 1965 alerted a new generation to the threat posed by major hurricanes. As radar showed the storm heading for the city, a mandatory evacuation of Eastern New Orleans was declared. The Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal channeled storm surge into the metro area. A levee failure was responsible for major flooding in the Lower 9th Ward. The heavy flood damage caused by Hurricane Betsy brought concerns about hurricane flooding to the forefront. Betsy resulted in a major redesign of the levee system. By authorizing the United States Army Corps of Engineers to design and construct the flood protection, Congress essentially overrode responsibility for flood protection by the local levee boards. The Flood Control Act of 1965 directed the Corps of Engineers to plan for the maximum anticipated hurricane for the area. (This project was still under construction when the city was struck by Katrina 40 years later.) The Corps of Engineers also designed a Lake Pontchartrain Hurricane Barrier to shield the city with flood gates like those which protect the Netherlands from the North Sea. Congress provided funding, and construction began in 1971. But the work stopped in 1977 when a federal judge ruled, in a lawsuit brought by the environmental group Save Our Wetlands, that the Corps' environmental impact statement was deficient. In 1985, after nearly a decade of court battles, the Corps scrapped the plan, and decided to reinforce the existing levee system instead. The threat of 1969's Hurricane Camille was known in advance through improved radar technology and much of New Orleans braced for a repeat of Betsy. But Camille turned east and wreaked havoc on the Gulf coast of Mississippi and Alabama. Hurricane Juan (1985) prompted a large evacuation from the city but did little damage. Hurricane Andrew threatened the city in 1992. Clearly a major killer storm which had already devastated parts of south Florida, it prompted the largest evacuation of the city to date. Andrew turned west of the city but prompted re-evaluation of emergency evacuation procedures. Hurricane Georges in 1998 precipitated an even larger evacuation. The Louisiana Superdome was opened as a shelter of last resort for those unable to evacuate, with unfortunate consequences as much of the venue was looted. Highways out of the city were tied up bumper to bumper, prompting development of the Contraflow lane reversal plan. The evacuation from Greater New Orleans and the Mississippi coast was the largest in U.S. history up to that point. Georges missed the city, but it caused significant storm surge, raising the level of Lake Pontchartrain to the point that the city was spared major flooding only by the lake levees and flood walls. There was significant destruction to the areas just outside the flood walls, including at Little Woods [?] and at West End near the mouth of the 17th Street Canal. 21st century In early 2001, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), named three major scenarios as being among the most serious threats to the nation: (1) a major hurricane hitting New Orleans, (2) a terrorist attack in New York City, and (3) a large earthquake hitting San Francisco.Berger, Eric. \\"Keeping its head above water: New Orleans faces doomsday scenario .\\" Houston Chronicle. December 1, 2001. In 2004, a Corps of Engineers study was done on the cost and feasibility of protecting southeast Louisiana from a major Category 5 hurricane, including construction of floodgate structures and raising existing levees. The report also suggested that the chances of a major Category 5 hurricane directly striking New Orleans was a one-in-500-year event.Lincoln, Eric. \\"Old plans revived for Category 5 hurricane protection .\\" United States Army Corps of Engineers. September–October 2004. =Warnings of dangerous vulnerability= In 2001, the Houston Chronicle published a story which predicted that a severe hurricane striking New Orleans, \\"would strand 250,000 people or more, and probably kill one of 10 left behind as the city drowned under of water. Thousands of refugees could end up in Houston.\\" In 2002, The Times Picayune published a feature covering various scenarios, including a Category 5 hurricane hitting the city from the south. The series also explored the various environmental changes that have increased the area's vulnerability. One article in the series concluded that hundreds of thousands would be left homeless, and it would take months to dry out the area and begin to make it liveable. But there wouldn't be much for residents to come home to. The local economy would be in ruins.McQuaid, John; Schleifstein, Mark. \\".\\" Times Picayune. June 23–27, 2002. Many concerns focus around the fact that the city lies below sea level with a levee system that was designed for hurricanes of no greater intensity than Category 3.Westerink, J.J.; Luettich, R.A. \\"The Creeping Storm.\\" Civil Engineering Magazine. June 2003. Furthermore, its natural defenses, the surrounding marshland and the barrier islands, have been dwindling in recent years.Bourne, Joel K. \\"Gone with the Water.\\" National Geographic. October 2004. Just a few months before Katrina, the FX docudrama Oil Storm depicted a Category 4 hurricane hitting New Orleans, killing thousands of people and forcing residents to evacuate and hide out in the Superdome, and speculated about a national economic meltdown caused by the decreased oil supply. =Hurricane Isidore= Hurricane Isidore in 2002 prompted some cautious New Orleanians to evacuate; the majority kept an eye on the news without leaving town. =LSU-USACE Study= In 2002 the Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Louisiana Water Resources Research Institute at Louisiana State University (LSU), and the authorities in Jefferson Parish, modeled the effects and aftermath of a Category 5 strike on New Orleans. The model predicted an unprecedented disaster, with extensive loss of life and property. The study identified the problem: the New Orleans area is like a bowl, surrounded by levees which are strongest along the outer Mississippi and primarily intended to contain river flooding. When a hurricane drives water into Lake Pontchartrain, the weaker levees bordering Pontchartrain and canals leading to it are overwhelmed. Water then flows into the below-sea-level city, accompanied by water overflowing the levees along the Mississippi on the south side of the city center.\\"Hurricane Risk for New Orleans.\\" American RadioWorks. September 2002. =Hurricane Ivan= In 2004 Hurricane Ivan's threat to the city resulted in the largest evacuation of the city to date. Mayor Ray Nagin issued a call for a voluntary evacuation of the city at 6 pm on September 13. An estimated 600,000 or more evacuated from Greater New Orleans. The contraflow plan was put into full effect for the first time, but rather late in the evacuation due to various confusions. This proved valuable practice, for the contraflow was implemented much more smoothly in 2005. =Hurricane Pam exercise= Hurricane Pam was a hypothetical hurricane used as a disaster scenario to drive planning for a 13-parish area in Southeastern Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans, in 2004.News Release. \\"Hurricane Pam Exercise Concludes .\\" Federal Emergency Management Agency. July 23, 2004.News Release. \\"IEM Team to Develop Catastrophic Hurricane Disaster Plan for New Orleans & Southeast Louisiana .\\" IEM . June 3, 2004. Developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Louisiana Office of Homeland Security, Emergency Preparedness, the National Weather Service, and Innovative Emergency Management, Inc., the mock hurricane scenario and its projected consequences were the focal point of an eight-day exercise held at the State Emergency Operations Center in Baton Rouge in July 2004. Hurricane Pam was a slow-moving Category 3 storm with sustained winds of 120 mph. It brought with it up to of rain to some parts of southeastern Louisiana and caused levee-topping storm surge. The consequence assessment for Hurricane Pam indicated that more than one million people would be displaced and that 600,000 buildings would be damaged, with some completely destroyed. 60,000 people would be killed. The report on the simulation, TIME reported, warned that transportation would be a major problem in any storm situation paralleling the fictional \\"Hurricane Pam.\\"1 The Mayor Amanda Ripley. TIME. September 13, 2005. Follow-on Hurricane Pam workshops were conducted in November/December 2004, July 2005, and August 2005. The Hurricane Pam scenario and the level of attention that the federal government paid to it were discussed following the catastrophic effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans in November and December 2005. On January 25, 2005, the Louisiana Sea Grant forum discussed additional results of several simulations of strong hurricanes hitting New Orleans.\\"Presidents' Forum on Meeting Coastal Challenges .\\" Louisiana Sea Grant. January 25, 2005. =Hurricane Cindy= Hurricane Cindy hit Louisiana at just barely hurricane strength on July 5, 2005. Many New Orleanians paid it little attention in advance, some having gotten blasé about threats of hurricanes which for decades had missed the city. However, Cindy's winds gusted to in the city, knocking branches off trees and causing New Orleans' largest blackout since Hurricane Betsy in 1965. The experience encouraged many to evacuate when the much more powerful Hurricane Katrina was heading towards the city less than two months later. =Hurricane Katrina= Evacuation route sign on Tulane Avenue in New Orleans shows lines from long-standing flood waters, after Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina threatened the city in August 2005. The eye of the huge storm grazed the eastern side of the city, sparing it from the worst of its power. However, due to poorly designed levees and the worst civil engineering failure in United States history, most of the city experienced flooding similar to a direct hit; see: Levee failures in Greater New Orleans, 2005. There were many predictions of hurricane risk in New Orleans before Katrina.Wilson, Jim. \\"New Orleans is Sinking .\\" Popular Mechanics. September 11, 2001.Fischetti, Mark. \\"Drowning New Orleans.\\" Scientific American. October 2001.Mooney, Chris. \\"Thinking Big About Hurricanes .\\" The American Prospect. May 23, 2005. On August 26 the storm, at one point up to a Category 5, was in the Gulf with a projection to possibly hit New Orleans a few days later. (The previous day the projected path was towards the Florida Panhandle.) On August 27 Mayor Nagin declared a state of emergency and called for a voluntary evacuation. The following day he issued the city's first ever whole-city mandatory evacuation order. A mandatory evacuation order is an extreme measure: the most recent such order in Louisiana occurred when east New Orleans was ordered evacuated in 1965. There have been various plans to mitigate or prevent catastrophes. The evacuation plans were the most successful. The contraflow worked relatively smoothly, and over 80% of the population succeeded in fleeing the area in advance of the storm. The evacuation no doubt saved thousands of lives. However, beyond the evacuation of those willing and able to leave town through their own resources, almost every other aspect of preparedness was found wanting. Like many other cities, New Orleans heavily relied on evacuation in case of a Category 5 storm. The inadequacy of evacuation plans was shown when no provision was made in time to evacuate the large number of people– elderly, disabled, those without cars– who could not leave by their own means. Blame for lack of preparedness has been leveled at all levels of government. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin has been criticized for not following the city's evacuation plan which called for the use of school buses to transport disadvantaged and elderly citizens out of the city. Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco was also criticized for not deploying the Louisiana National Guard sooner, although she did in fact deploy them before the hurricane hit and requested reinforcements from other states. Blanco asked for additional resources from the federal government, but refused to declare martial law or a state of emergency. Disorganization began when the Louisiana Governor declined a proposal from the White House to put National Guard troops under the control of the federal government. President George W. Bush and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff were also criticized for failures on the federal level as well as with his leadership role.Glassner, Susan B.; White, Josh. \\"Storm Exposed Disarray at the Top.\\" Washington Post. September 4, 2005. FEMA chief Michael D. Brown admitted on the 1 year anniversary of landfall that \\"There was no plan\\" and claimed that in the immediate aftermath of the disaster White House officials told him to lie to put a more positive spin on the Federal response. Hurricane relief plan vs. non-existent flood relief plan One of the most significant planning failures was that there was no plan for the effects of a levee breach with the mass flooding that would result. After a typical hurricane hit the region, the plan would be for disaster relief forces to reach the city by overland routes. Since there was no New Orleans mass flooding and isolation by flooding plan, the plan that was pulled off the books was the hurricane relief plan. This plan failed because the relief personnel, most of whom were in trucks, could not get past nor through the areas that were under water. That there was no mass flooding relief plan to be executed was obvious by the lack of any heavy- lift helicopters such as Chinooks in relief forces that would have replaced the usual truck-born hurricane relief forces. A mass flooding with regional isolation plan would not have used land-based relief forces at all overland relief was impossible because of the barrier in place with the flooding. Louisiana Superdome fiasco The designation by the city of the Louisiana Superdome as the \\"shelter of last resort\\" proved poor. It did not meet the safety standards required for a Red Cross shelter and thus it was not staffed by them or the Salvation Army.Townsend, Frances Fargo. \\"Katrina Lessons Learned.\\" The White House. February 23, 2006. Thousands were trapped inside it as the area around it flooded and part of the roof blew off. Provisions for supplies were just barely adequate; sanitation, medical, and crowd control were worse. Since there was no flood-based federal nor state plan, heavy lift capacity helicopters that could have brought 16 tons of water, medical and food per flight were nowhere to be found. The much less effective hurricane-only response utilized much smaller UH and Black Hawk helicopters. Under the National Response Plan, disaster planning is first and foremost a local government responsibility. On the day after the Hurricane, Michael Chertoff invoked the National Response Plan, transferring emergency authority to the Department of Homeland Security. Civil order broke down, infrastructure failed, and some 80% of the city flooded. A few government responders, including Coast Guard helicopters and Louisiana Fisheries & Wildlife Boats, responded early and worked hard to save people stranded in the flooding, but their numbers were inadequate for the scope of the disaster. Private volunteers with boats assisted with rescue in great numbers, but significant Federal response was largely absent until 5 days after the disaster. =Post-Katrina= Windows of building in Uptown New Orleans being boarded up in preparation of a possible threat from Hurricane Gustav, August 28, 2008. The next major hurricane threat to the city after Katrina came less than a month later, as Hurricane Rita headed towards the Gulf Coast as the city was still in ruins. Repopulation of some parts of the city had just begun when it was canceled and the city ordered re-evacuation. The levee system again failed, re-flooding low-lying portions of the city such as the Lower Ninth Ward. Hurricane Ernesto in 2006 originally threatened Louisiana before hitting Florida, causing early preparations and rising oil prices. Making landfall in Louisiana on September 1, 2008 as a category two hurricane, Hurricane Gustav was the first to put large scale preparations in motion, although the storm was still in Caribbean on the third anniversary of Katrina. Locals were warned to prepare for a possible evacuation of the city and additional National Guard units were called out, and a state of emergency was declared. Soon afterwards, 1.9 million people were evacuated from southern Louisiana, including 200,000 from the City of New Orleans. Contraflow lanes were again initiated. Forty-three deaths occurred in Louisiana as a result of the storm.\\"14 more deaths tied to Gustav,\\" The Times-Picayune, September 13, 2008 Levee preparations and funding issues Southeast Louisiana Project funding: _2004_ : *Corps of Engineers' request: $11 million *Bush request: $3 million *Approved by Congress: $5.5 million _2005_ : *Corps of Engineers' request: $22.5 million *Bush request: $3.9 million *Approved by Congress: $5.7 million _2006_ : *Bush request: $2.9 million While no detailed proposals had yet been made to augment the New Orleans levee system to be capable of withstanding a category 4 or greater hurricane, in October 2004, the Corps of Engineers submitted a proposal to Congress requesting US$4 Million to fund a preliminary study for such a plan. Congress tabled the proposal, never addressing it on the floor, citing budgetary concerns resulting from the Iraq War. A senior Corps official made an off-hand estimate that this project would require approximately $1 Billion dollars and would take 20 years, stating \\"It's possible to protect New Orleans from a Category 5 hurricane... we've got to start. To do nothing is tantamount to negligence.\\"Nussbaum, Paul. The Philadelphia Inquirer. October 8, 2004. Whether or not such additional funding might have been capable of preventing the extensive flooding in New Orleans caused by Katrina, is a matter that has yet to be determined. Starting in 2003, federal spending on the Southeast Louisiana Project was substantially reduced. Lt. General Carl Strock, Chief of Engineers at the Corps of Engineers, said that, \\"at the time that these levees were designed and constructed, it was felt that that was an adequate level given the probability of an event like this occurring.\\" Strock also said that he did not believed that funding levels contributed to the disaster, commenting that, \\"the intensity of this storm simply exceeded the design capacity of this levee.\\" Strock also told reporters that the Corps of Engineers \\"had a 200- or 300-year level of protection. That means that an event that we were protecting from might be exceeded every 200 or 300 years.\\"News Transcript. \\"Defense Department Special Briefing on Efforts to Mitigate Infrastructure Damage from Hurricane Katrina.\\" United States Department of Defense. September 2, 2005. From 2001 through 2005, the Bush administration battled with Congress to cut a total of approximately 67% from the budgetary requests from the Corps of Engineers for levee augmentation projects in the New Orleans area, but ultimately settled with Congress on a 50% cut in these budgetary requests. In February 2004, Al Naomi, a project manager for the Corps of Engineers, stated that, \\"I've got at least six levee construction contracts (in the New Orleans area where funding has been cut) that need to be done to raise the levee protection back to where it should be (because of settling). Right now I owe my contractors about US$5 Million. And we're going to have to pay them interest.\\"Bunch, Will. \\"Why the Levee Broke.\\" AlterNet. September 1, 2005. Even as the Bush administration was cutting the Corps of Engineers' budget, many were criticizing the administration for not cutting the budget more. The New York Times, in particular, published several editorials criticizing the large size of the $17 Billion Corps budget, and called for the Senate to cut, \\"pork,\\" in S. 728, which would have provided $512 Million in funding for hurricane protection projects in southern Louisiana.Sheppard, Noel. The American Thinker. September 6, 2005. Just after Hurricane Katrina hit, there was some concern expressed that government officials had placed an overemphasis on disaster recovery, while neglecting the process of pre-planning and preparation.Walsh, Bill; Alpert, Bruce; McQuaid, John. Newhouse News Service. August 31, 2005. In the 17 months following Katrina, five investigations were carried out. The only federally ordered study was conducted by the American Society of Civil Engineers and paid for by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Two major independent studies were done by the University of California at BerkeleyILIT DOWNLOAD CENTER (sponsored in part by the National Science Foundation) and Louisiana State University.http://www.dotd.louisiana.gov/administration/teamlouisiana/TeamLaLetter.pdf Two minor studies were done by FEMA and the insurance industry. All five studies basically agree on the engineering mechanisms of failure. The failure mechanisms included overtopping of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge, consequential undermining of flood wall foundations or other weakening by water of the wall foundations, and the storm surge pressures exceeding the strength of the floodwalls. In June 2006, a contrite Lt. Gen Carl Strock took responsibility for the failure of metro New Orleans flood protection, calling the system \\"a system in name only.\\"Army engineers admit levees were badly made – International Herald Tribune As of August 2006, the Corps of Engineers planned to spend $6 billion to make sure that by 2010, the city would probably be flooded only once every 100 years. But this would not equal the best levee system in the world, which is in The Netherlands. That system is designed to protect populated areas against anything but a 1-in-10,000-years flood. If the Corps built a 1-in-500-year levee system in New Orleans, Ivan van Heerden, deputy director of Louisiana State University's Hurricane Center, says, it would cost $30 billion.Why We Don't Prepare For Disaster, Amanda Ripley. TIME. August 20, 2006. According to a study by the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, levees and floodwalls surrounding New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against overtopping or failure in extreme events. Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that completely eliminate risk. For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.National Academy of Sciences \\"Levees Cannot Fully Eliminate Risk of Flooding to New Orleans\\" April 24, 2009 The impact of Louisiana's sinking coast When the Corps of Engineers started systematically leveeing the river in the 19th century, it cut off the region's main source of silt, the raw material of delta-building in the Mississippi Delta and the Wetlands of Louisiana. The weight of large buildings and infrastructure and the leaching of water, oil and gas from beneath the surface across the region have also contributed to the problem. Following the great floods of 1927, the Mississippi River was surrounded by a series of levees meant to protect the city from such floods. In 1965, New Orleans was hit by Hurricane Betsy, which caused tremendous flooding in the New Orleans area. The federal government began a levee-building program to protect New Orleans from a Category 3 hurricane (the same strength as Betsy). These series of levees were completed in recent years before Hurricane Katrina. However, an unintended consequence of the levees was that natural silt deposits from the Mississippi River were unable to replenish the delta, causing the coastal wetlands of Louisiana to wash away and the city of New Orleans to sink even deeper. The Mississippi River delta is subsiding faster than any other place in the nation. While the land is sinking, sea level has been rising. In the past 100 years, land subsidence and sea-level rise have recently added three feet to all storm surges. That extra height puts affected areas under deeper water; it also means flooding from weaker storms and from the outer edges of powerful storms spreads over wider areas. The marshes that ring New Orleans, as well as the land depression of the city itself, originally above sea level, have sunk the quickest. The problem with the wetlands was further worsened by salt water intrusion caused by the canals dug by the oil companies and private individuals in this marshland. This erosion of the wetlands not only caused Louisiana to lose per year of land annually and of land since the 1930s, but it also destroyed Louisiana's first line of defense against hurricanes. Hurricanes draw their strength from the sea, so they quickly weaken and begin to dissipate when they make landfall. Hurricanes moving over fragmenting marshes toward the New Orleans area can retain more strength, and their winds and large waves pack more speed and destructive power. Scientists working for the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources measured some of these effects during Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Andrew's surge height dropped from at Cocodrie to at the Houma Navigation Canal to the north. For every mile of the marsh-and-water landscape it traversed, it lost 3.1 inches of height, sparing some homes farther north from more flooding. Currently Louisiana has 30% of the total coastal marsh and accounts for 90% of the coastal marsh loss in the lower 48 states. The engineering of the river has basically brought the Gulf of Mexico much closer to New Orleans, making it more vulnerable to hurricanes. The combination of sinking land and rising seas has placed the Mississippi River delta as much as lower relative to sea level than it was a century ago, and the process continues. That means hurricane floods driven inland from the Gulf have risen by corresponding amounts. Storms that once would not have had much impact can now be devastating events, and flooding now penetrates into places where it has rarely occurred before. The problem also is slowly eroding levee protection, cutting off evacuation routes sooner and putting dozens of communities and valuable infrastructure at risk of being wiped out by the flooding. State and federal officials have recently pushed a $14 billion plan to rebuild wetlands over the next 30 years, to be funded by oil and gas royalties, called Coast 2050. \\"Coast 2050 .\\" Accessed April 2, 2006. Louisiana will receive US$540 million under the energy bill enacted in August 2005. More money for this program is likely to come with aid from Hurricane Katrina. The original actual cost needed for the project, however, was $14 billion. Wetlands have the capacity to absorb storm surges at the rate of per . However, due to the systematic, long-term nature of wetland loss, and because wetland remediation can take decades,Schleifstein, Mark. \\" Coastal Resuscitation .\\" Times Picayune. June 23–27, 2002. it is not possible to pinpoint blame for wetland loss on any specific Congress, legislature, President, or governor.

It was founded in 1980 in the city of Martin, in what was then Czechoslovakia. The band won the Zlatý slavík music award in 1989, 1990, and again in 1991. After the success of their first album, Team, in 1988, the band decided to rerecord it in Esperanto. This made it easier for them to travel abroad, especially the UK, as they played at Esperanto meets outside of Czechoslovakia. The song \\"Držím ti miesto\\" (I'm Holding You a Spot) from their 1990 album Team 3 was included on the soundtrack of the 2005 American film Hostel. Biography Beginnings Team was founded by guitarist Dušan Antalík and bassist Ivan Válek in 1980 in the city of Martin. This was part of Czechoslovakia at the time, and is now in Slovakia. The band's first known lineup consisted of Antalík, Válek, as well as singer and keyboardist Milan Dočekal and drummer Ivan Marček. Between 1982 and 1984, the group was inactive as its members had to perform compulsory military service. They got back together in 1985 and recorded their first single, \\"Beh\\" (Run). In 1986, they were joined by second keyboardist Bohuš Kantor. They recorded their second single, \\"Na jednej lodi\\" (On One Boat), and began preparing their debut album. Early albums In 1988, vocalist Pavol Habera joined Team. Most of the material for the band's debut album had already been prepared, and Habera contributed the songs \\"Máš moje číslo\\" (You've Got My Number) and \\"List od Vincenta\\" (Letter from Vincent), which he originally recorded with his previous band Avion. The record's biggest success was the track \\"Reklama na ticho\\" (Silent Advertisement), and the album itself did very well. Team decided to record it again in Esperanto, with the help of new manager Stano Marček. Their second album, Team 2 - Prichytený pri živote (Caught Alive) saw the replacement of drummer Ivan Marček with Erich Siegel. The album was carried by the singles \\"Prievan v peňaženke\\" (Hole in the Wallet) and \\"Lietam v tom tiež\\" (I'm in it Too). Siegel also played on Team's next album, Team 3, which spawned the hit \\"Držím ti miesto\\" (I'm Holding You a Spot). During this period, the group moved from Opus Records to Tommü Records. Pavol Habera launched a successful solo career in 1990, the same year Team 3 was released. Team 4, 5, 6 Ivan Marček returned to play on Team's fourth album, Team 4, which was released in 1991. The record was produced by the group independently and recorded at a studio built by Antalík and Dočekal. In 1993, the album Team 5 was released, and included a track sung by Dušan Antalík. In 1995, Team announced they were taking a one-year break. Upon their return in 1996, Team released the album Team 6 - Voľná zóna (Free Zone). This was the only album without Habera on vocals, with Roman Révai behind the microphone, except for the song \\"Moc mlada\\" (Too Young), which was sung by Antalík. It was also the last album with Bohuš Kantor. Milan Dočekal and Ivan Marček also did not take part in the project, with Ďuso Petrus taking over on drums. Habera's return–present In 1997, Habera returned to Team. Their next album, Team 7 - 7edem (7even), was released in 2000. It included the hit \\"Krátke lásky\\" (Short Loves). A new keyboard player, Juraj Tatár, was added to the group. Marček returned again on drums for the band's next album, Team 8 - Mám na teba chuť :-) (I've Got a Taste for You), which came out in 2002. In addition to the title song, the track \\"Slovník cudzích snov\\" (Dictionary of Foreign Dreams) was also a success. In 2003, the band recorded the concert album Team 9 - Live in Praha. This was followed by Team X and Team 11, released in 2004 and 2007, respectively. In December 2011, the band announced a farewell tour for 2012. Habera stated: \\"After almost 30 years since the establishment of Team, we want to close one extraordinary and successful chapter of our musical lives, and the best way is to play for our fans.\\" Team planned to play in six Slovak and ten Czech cities. They were accompanied on tour by the band Horská Chata, from Team's hometown of Martin. In May 2014, longtime drummer Ivan Marček died. His replacement is Marcel Buntaj. The band continues to tour and perform. In 2019, they conducted the Habera & Team 2019 Tour of Czechia and Slovakia.

It is a station on the Sheffield to Doncaster Line south west of Doncaster. As the original station at Mexborough Junction did not serve the line to Rotherham and Sheffield when this opened it was replaced by a new station built immediately on the Doncaster side of the junction. The new station was approximately halfway between Mexborough Junction and Mexborough (Ferry Boat) Halt and was able to serve the town centre at the top of Station Road. It was on 1 June 1874 that the third side of the triangle (Mexborough Reverse Curve) was put in place which allowed trains to work from the Sheffield line to Barnsley without need of reversal. This was closed on 5 September 1966. The Barnsley to Doncaster local passenger services were withdrawn on 29 June 1959 and further changes in the area took place with the opening of Aldwarke Junction in 1966. From this date all passenger trains to Sheffield were routed to Sheffield Midland: at first via the Swinton curve, until its closure in January 1968, and thereafter via the Great Central route through the closed Kilnhurst Central. Nowadays trains mostly operate via the re-instated Swinton curve to the new Swinton (a few passenger trains still use the old GCR line for operational reasons).\\"Passenger Train Services over Unusual Lines 2016 Edition, Yorkshire & Humberside Region\\" Retrieved 27 April 2016 Mexborough once had a third platform which, in effect, made the Sheffield-bound platform an \\"island\\". This was used occasionally for regular passenger services travelling via the Great Central line to Sheffield but more often by excursion trains to East Coast resorts such as Scarborough, Bridlington and Cleethorpes. This platform face ceased to be used in the late 1970s but can still be seen. As part of the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive's 4-year plan for upgrading the railways in the county, Mexborough received an upgraded waiting area and ticket office which were completed in May 1989. In 2009/2010, Mexborough was further improved by help points, an updated PA system, refurbished toilets and booking office area, additional shelters and CCTV, information screens and improved access for the disabled. Mexborough West Junction in 1950 In 2011 Mexborough won the category 'Station of the Year (Small)' at the National Rail Awards.Rail, 21 September – 4 October 2011. p.12 Facilities The station's booking office is manned each day on a part-time basis (06:00-19:00 Monday to Saturday, 08:00-16:00 Sundays). Outside these times, tickets must be bought on the train or in advance. There are waiting rooms on both platforms and a customer help point on platform 2. Digital display screens, timetable posters and automated train announcements offer train running information and there is step-free access to both platforms.Mexborough station facilitiesNational Rail Enquiries Service Monday to Saturday services consist of two westbound services per hour: both of which terminate at Sheffield. The two eastbound services travel run to Doncaster, with alternate services through to Adwick. On Sundays there is an hourly service to Sheffield and to Doncaster. Services are generally formed of Arriva Northern Class 142 and Class 144 'Pacer' DMU's; with Class 150, Class 153 and Class 158 also appearing on certain services. The latter units have become increasingly common since the winter 2019 timetable change, as the Pacer units are gradually being withdrawn from service and scrapped. After the May 2018 timetable change, Mexborough no longer has direct trains to Scunthorpe or Lincoln, and the two Transpennine Express services that previously called here now pass through non-stop. Regular through trains to Hull have also now ceased (from December 2019), with passengers having to change at Doncaster for onward connections.

Born in Stockholm, Söderström received her first musical schooling from Adelaide von Skilondz and later studied at the Royal College of Music, Stockholm. She made her debut in 1947 at the Drottningholm Palace Theatre singing in one of Mozart's lesser-known works Bastien et Bastienne. From 1949 to 1980 she called the Royal Swedish Opera her home but she frequently appeared at some of the largest opera houses in the world. She was also a regular visitor to the recording studio. Between 1959 and 1964 Söderström was contracted by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City to which she would return in 1983–87. Her last stage performance was in 1999 in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1978 she created the role of Amanda/Clitoria in György Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre at the Royal Swedish Opera. During her long career, Söderström made a name for herself as a technically perfect and at the same time warm soprano with a personal style which allowed her to sing in a wide variety of different works ranging from 17th century to contemporary. Between appearances in fully staged operas, Söderström gave numerous concerts and recitals in all corners of the world. She made a variety of recordings, including the complete songs of Sergei Rachmaninoff, accompanied by Vladimir Ashkenazy. Between 1993 and 1996 Söderström was the director of the Drottningholm Palace Theatre, the very stage where she had made her debut almost 50 years earlier. In 1983, she sang the final trio from Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier with Kathleen Battle and Frederica von Stade at The Metropolitan Opera Centennial Gala conducted by James Levine.

There is also a shop, a pub - the Angel Inn, a farm shop, a playing field and allotments, tennis courts and the local vet. The church of St Peter and St Paul Wangford Church The Parish church of Wangford cum Henham is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul; situated near the centre of the village. The church here was near derelict by the mid-19th century. It was all that survived of a Cluniac Priory, a cell to the mother Priory at Thetford in Norfolk. Left derelict at the end of the 19th century, it was restored by the local Rous family, the Earls of Stradbroke who set about creating a monument to themselves here because there is no church in the parish of Henham. The architect was A. L. Blackburne. All was demolished except for the nave walls. A grand chancel was then built at the east end, and beside it in the 1870s, an impressive tower. The top of the tower is finished in the 14th century Suffolk manner. It sits at the east end of the north aisle. Inside, the west end of the nave has a huge window, which may possibly be the rebuilding of a previous tower arch. The north porch is the only other medieval survival which seems to have had a side sliced off it by the buttress to the north aisle.

The treble (the smallest) is the oldest bell in the tower being cast by William Brend of Norwich in 1624. The following year, in 1625, the tenor (the largest) was cast at the same foundry by William & Alice Brend. The third was cast by John Darbie of Ipswich in 1668 and the fourth dates from 1721 and is by John Stephens of Norwich. The newest bell in the tower is the second which was cast by John Warner & Sons of London in 1863. This bell was recast from the metal of an earlier bell also cast by John Stephens.

Geography Nearby villages/towns are Penclawdd (west), Three Crosses and Dunvant (south), Waunarlwydd (east, contiguous with Gowerton), Gorseinon (north) and Loughor (north-west). From 1974-1966, Gowerton was part of the district of Lliw Valley (Dyffryn Lliw) within West Glamorgan. People from Gowerton are often referred to as \\"starch\\". When the local area processed steel for export, the steel owners and white collar workers lived in the Gowerton area; hence the name \\"starch\\". On the other hand, many of the manual workers resided in neighbouring Penclawdd and are known by the affectionate term \\"donks\\". Gowerton is twinned with La Gacilly in Brittany, France.

Killay has its own community council. The village is set high above sea level, about 3.5 miles west of Swansea city centre. It adjoins the town of Dunvant and the Tycoch area of Swansea. Gowerton lies to the north. The community had a population of 5,702 in 2011.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W04000573 The north of the area is mainly residential and is deemed a relatively affluent area of Swansea. The south of the area consists of an unpopulated common, which is used for grazing and forms part of Gower Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There is also another community called Upper Killay. Geography Killay Marsh Local Nature Reserve covers 21.3 acres (8.62 hectares) and comprises a mosaic of wetland habitats. Wet woodland (alder and willow carr), swamp and marsh habitat straddle the upper River Clyne with open marsh, fen, wet heath, with drier grassland and woodland on the slightly drier marginal area. The Local Nature Reserve is a remnant of a much larger wetland area destroyed by land reclamation animation for development including housing and landfill between 1930 and 1970. The land is owned by the City and County of Swansea and has been managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales since 1995. History of Mining The village of Killay evolved as a direct result of the south Wales coal industry. There were a good number of mines in Killay, the Clyne valley and in the neighbouring village of Dunvant dating back as far as the 14th century. The largest company, but also one of the latest, to mine coal in the district was the Killan Colliery Company, which began operations in 1899. There were two drifts, one working the Penlan seam, the other the Penclawdd seam. In 1902 the colliery was taken over by W.W. Holmes and Co. By 1919 the mine had grown to be one of the largest in the area employing 755 men, mostly from the nearby village of Dunvant. In 1920 Henry Folland's Killan Collieries Ltd bought the colliery as a source of supply for his Grovesend Steel and Tinplate Company. In 1923 the Penclawdd drift was also producing house coal and had grown to over 1,500 yards in length. =The Killan Colliery Disaster= On 27 November 1924, an inrush of water flooded the mine with such terrible force that it tore out the roof. As soon as the news reached the surface, rescuers rushed to the mine from afar to assist several trapped miners. Two bodies were recovered almost instantly, and it soon became apparent that a further eleven men were entombed in the mine. Pumps were brought in from other mines, and rescuers made frantic attempts to reach the trapped miners. After fifty hours, a call reached the surface to send down ladders because eight men had been located. The men had survived after breathing from an air pocket and were soon to be freed. Divers were then sent to search for the remaining three men who were still missing without success. It was not until 1 January 1925 that their bodies were finally retrieved. The men who lost their lives in the disaster were: * Wilfred John (17) * Willie Goulding (22) * Charles Evans (30) * Archie Davis (28) * Phil Godbeer (32) The mine would never recover from the disaster, and was to close later that year in 1925.

The court tabouret was an elaborate, upholstered stool with curved wooden legs and tassels, carried by a liveried and wigged servant.

This method was also known as \\"mutual instruction\\" or the \\"Bell- Lancaster method\\" after the British educators Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster who both independently developed it. The method was based on the abler pupils being used as 'helpers' to the teacher, passing on the information they had learned to other students.. Monitorial Systems The Monitorial System was found very useful by 19th-century educators, as it proved to be a cheap way of making primary education more inclusive, thus making it possible to increase the average class size. Joseph Lancaster's motto for his method was Qui docet, discit -- \\"He who teaches, learns.\\" The methodology was adopted by the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, and later by the National Schools System. The Monitorial System, although widely spread and with many advocates, fell into disfavour with David Stow's \\"Glasgow System\\" which advocated trained teachers with higher goals than those of monitors. The basic teaching and learning process used in the Monitorial System has been used in passing knowledge between people in many cultures because of its low cost to benefit ratio. Numerous institutions use the basic concept as their primary mode of instruction. There have been many observations regarding its efficacy, in 35AD in Rome, Seneca the Younger, in an epistle to his friend, Lucillus, noted: Docendo discimus - we learn by teaching.  The Lancasterian System  Count Confalonieri and Silvio Pellico attend a demonstration of the Bell-Lancaster method in the Piedmont, Italy (1860s). Lancaster specified an ideal classroom (hall) as being a \\"parallelogram, the length about twice the width. The windows were to be six feet from the floor. The floor should be inclined, rising one foot in twenty from the master's desk to the upper end of the room, where the highest class is situated. The master's desk is on the middle of a platform two to three feet high, erected at the lower end of the room. Forms and desks, fixed firmly to the ground, occupy the middle of the room, a passage being left between the ends of the forms and the wall, five or six feet broad, where the children form semicircles for reading.\\" According to Gladman, to stimulate effort and reward merit, \\"Lancaster used Place Taking abundantly. He also had medals and badges of merit... Tickets could be earned too; these had a trifling pecuniary value.\\" Prizes were given \\"to excess\\" ceremonially.. Frequent changes of routine aided discipline. A code of command and exact movements also reinforced discipline. Class lists and registers were kept. Children were classified on a dual principle according to their ability in reading and arithmetic. Lancaster described his system as to produce a \\"Christian Education\\" and \\"train children in the practice of such moral habits as are conducive to the welfare of society.\\"  The Madras System  Bell's \\"Madras System\\" was so named because it originated at the Military Male Orphan Asylum, Egmore, near Madras. Gladman describes Bell's system from notes taken from \\"Bell's Manual\\" which had been published by the National Society two years after Bell's death, in 1832. \\"After observing children in a native school, seated on the ground, and writing in the sand, he set a boy, John Frisken, to teach the alphabet on the same principle... Bell was consequently led to extend and elaborate the system.\\" Bell declared \\"There is a faculty, inherent in the mind, of conveying and receiving mutual instruction\\". In 1796, John Frisken was 12 years and 8 months old. With assistants, he was in charge of 91 boys. Dr Bell's School, Leith The school was arranged in forms or classes, each consisting of about 36 members of similar proficiency, as classified by reading ability. The young teachers were kept to task through registers. Reading, Ciphering and Religious rehearsals were tracked through the paidometer register. Discipline was held through a 'Black Book', which had entries which were read to the entire school, and the faults were explained in moral terms. The hall was built in rectangles, with windows five feet from the floor, but opening at the top. Desks were placed against walls, and the Master's desk was raised. \\"Fixing the master thus, deprived him of much of his power; he would do more good in passing from class to class, and teaching.\\" critics said. Comparison Frederick John Gladman, writing in the 1880s, distinguishes between the Lancasterian system and the Madras System. The Lancasterian System is described as preferring smaller classes, unlike Bell's Madras System. Despite the many similarities of the two systems, and the initial friendship of Lancaster and Bell, divisions appeared between their advocates. In 1805, Sarah Trimmer published a paper claiming Lancaster's system was antagonistic to the Anglican Church. It was said that the country was soon divided into two camps; speeches, sermons, magazine articles and pamphlets appeared on each side. The National Society was formed to propagate Bell's System and the British and Foreign School Society (B&FSS;) was formed to propagate Lancaster's System. There is one surviving Lancaster-designed British School in Hitchin, Hertfordshire- and this is now run as a museum with an experiential educational program suitable for Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 pupils.

He was born to a poor family in the Kingdom of Naples, and studied judicial astrology, a subject he defended in his Oratio de Inventoribus et Astrologiae Laudibus (1508). Judicial astrology concerned the fate of man (astrologia judiciaria; mundane astrology) as influenced by the stars. His most famous work is the Tractatus Astrologicus. Career as astrologer Gaurico's reputation was such that he served as an \\"astrological consultant\\" to Catherine de' Medici. Gaurico had predicted the accession to the papacy of Catherine's great-uncle Giovanni de Medici (when he was 14 – who later became Leo X) and predicted Catherine's uncle Giulio de Medici involvement in important political struggles and numerous descendants. Giulio de Medici later was to become Pope Clement VII, who involved with disputes with both Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and Henry VIII of England. Giovanni II Bentivoglio, ruler of Bologna, consulted him about his destiny. Displeased with Gaurico's prophecy, Bentivoglio subjected Gaurico to the torture of mancuerda, the effects of which he suffered for the rest of his life, and exiled the astrologer. When Bologna fell to Pope Julius II, Gaurico returned to general favor.BOOK XVI: HISTORY OF THE ESOTERIC ORDERS. Archived from santiagobovisio.com Gaurico became famous after predicting the ascension of Alessandro Farnese, a prediction that came true with Farnese's ascension as Paul III. Gaurico foretold also the sickness and death of this Pontiff, who died on November 20, 1549, the day said to have been indicated by Gaurico. Paul III obviously did not wait for his death in order to verify Gaurico's prediction. Paul III, who encouraged astrologers to come to Rome and work under his protection, made Gaurico his unofficial astrologer, and he was made a Papal Table Companion, knighted, and appointed bishop of Giffoni (Salerno province), and thus described as Episcopus Geophonensis, in 1539. Paul III made Gaurico bishop of Civitate (San Severo), in Capitanata, in southern Italy, in 1545. Four years after the death of Paul III, Gaurico abandoned these duties and settled in Rome. The Tractatus Astrologicus contained the natal charts of popes and cardinals, kings and nobles, scholars, musicians and artists. Gaurico systematically examined each natal chart, compared it to the life of the person in question, and in the case of living subjects, predicted the outcome of their lives and careers. Gaurico also attempted to calculate the exact date of Jesus' crucifixion, and the number of hours between it and the resurrection. Allegedly, both he and Nostradamus were responsible for predicting the death of Henry II of France in a tournament in 1559. Henry II of France, whose death both Nostradamus and Gauricus are said to have predicted. Allegedly, Catherine de' Medici had wished to know Henry's destiny as the Apparent Heir of France. Allegedly, Gaurico replied that the Heir would exert his royal power, which would first marked by a duel, and finally by another duel that would put a stop to his reign and his life. Allegedly, he also explained in detail the kind of wound that would result in the death of Henry II during this duel. Allegedly, the danger of this duel was considered impossible because of the social condition of the Prince, and Gaurico was not believed. Allegedly, Gaurico insisted on his statements, printed in France in 1552, that is, seven years before the well-known joust in which Henry II would find his death. He is also said to have sent a letter to the King repeating with full details his prediction and advising him to avoid any single combat in closed field, especially around the time when he had reached 41 years of age, since a wound on his head, at this age, could produce his blindness or his death. Allegedly, the letter did not deter Henry. On July 1, 1559, during a match to celebrate the Peace Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis with his longtime enemies, the Habsburgs of Austria and to celebrate the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth of Valois to King Philip II of Spain, during the final joust, King Henry's eye was pierced by a sliver that penetrated the brain, from the shattered lance of Gabriel Montgomery, captain of the King's Scottish Guard. He suffered terribly, and, despite the efforts of royal surgeon Ambroise Paré, died on July 10, 1559 and was buried in a cadaver tomb in Saint Denis Basilica. In fact, the one known horoscope of Henri II by Gaurico is literally quoted in the Dictionnaire of Pierre Bayle. There is no question of a duel. Gaurico promises the best successes to Henri II and adds that he shall live up to the age of 69 year, 10 month and 12 days, provided that he passes the years 56, 63 and 64 of his age.Pierre Bayle, Dictionnaire historique et critique, ed. Paris, 1820, t. 8, article Henri II, p. 26, available on Internet Archive, quotation of Gaurico, Tractatus astrologicus, Venice, 1552, folio 42, verso. There exists another version of Gaurico's prophecy, given by Erasmo Pèrcopo, L’umanista Pomponio Gaurico. Luca Gaurico ultimo degli astrologi, Napoli, Luigi Pierro, 1895, p. 159, who refers to Gui du Faur de Pibrac, Apologie à la reine Marguerite, in D'Artigny, Mémoires d'histoire, de critique et de littérature, Paris, 1749, t. II and t. III, pp. 317 and ff. The passage of Pibrac is quoted p. 410 of volume II of D'Artigny's book and in vol. III, pp. 317 and ff., D'Artigny argues against the authenticity of the prediction attributed by Pibrac to Gaurico. See David Clement, Bibliothèque curieuse, t. 9, chez Jean Guillaume Schmid, 1760, available on Google Books In regard to the birth of Martin Luther, Gaurico found a connection between this date (November 10, 1483, according to the reckoning of the Gregorian Calendar) and a \\"grand conjunction,\\" that is, a meeting of the planets Jupiter and Saturn. Grand conjunctions were meant to predict extensive changes in the secular and religious power structures. Because the “grand conjunction” of 1484 took place in the sign of Scorpio, an astrological sign that stood for radical, revolutionary events as well as for epidemics and widespread death, this indicated to Gaurico that dramatic changes would occur in all social spheres –such as would result from the Reformation.The Coming of a 'Little Prophet': Astrological Pamphlets and the Reformation.

Astrology and buildings Ephemerides recognitae et ad unguem castigatae, 1533 Super diebus decretoriis quos etiam criticos vocitant axiomata, 1546 Gaurico was widely renowned as an astrologer, and his Tractatus Astrologicus (1552) also contained charts of the foundation of various buildings and cities. Pope Paul III thus used Gaurico to determine the most auspicious time at which the cornerstone of a new building in the neighborhood of St Peter's Basilica should be laid. It is said that Gaurico arrived at the scene in great pomp. An assistant, the astrologer Vincentius Campanatius of Bologna, was commanded to inspect the sky with an astrolabe and cry out in a loud voice the best time when the moment to lay the first marble slab arrived.Success – And The Beginning Of Failure.

Gijsbert Haan  Life prior to secession Born in Hilversum, North Holland, Netherlands on January 3, 1801, Gijsbert grew up as a member of the Reformed Church in Hilversum. He was married to Marritje Pos (September 28, 1800 - August 26, 1876) after he learned that she was pregnant due to an affair several months before. Over the course of their marriage, they had at least 13 children, 10 of whom survived into adulthood. On July 26, 1847, due to social and religious persecution as well as severe famine, Haan and his family emigrated from the Netherlands on the passenger ship Centurion. Under the guidance of Albertus van Raalte they established a colony in Holland, Michigan. In 1850 they aligned themselves with the Reformed Church in America (RCA). At that point, they were considered to be a classis (a \\"governing body of a group of churches in the Reformed system, made up of clergymen [and] ruling elders...\\") within the RCA.\\"Albertus C. Van Raalte and his Dutch settlements in the United States\\" by Albert Hyma.\\"Netherlanders in America: Dutch Immigration to the United States and Canada, 1789-1950\\" by Henry S. Lucas Although most churches within the classis were content with their affiliation to the RCA, one church under the leadership of Haan found that the RCA was inadequate. Haan warned that the RCA \\"was not sound\\". This was reminiscent of a former schism in the Netherlands when the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands separated from the Dutch Reformed Church because of its supposed \\"theological laxity\\". Over time, dissension began to grow largely due to Haan's preaching against the RCA.\\"By grace alone: stories of the Reformed Church in America\\" by Donald J. Bruggink, Kim N. Baker.  Secession  In 1857 Haan's followers sent documents of secession to the classis in an attempt to garner support for an exodus from the RCA. The principal arguments in the document were that the RCA conducted \\"open communion\\", sang hymns whose lyrics were not based on Biblical psalms, overlooked catechism preaching, and did not support the secession in the Netherlands. Although the classis did not approve of the secession documents, one church did decide to leave the RCA in January 1857. Soon, other churches followed suit. In 1859 these secessionist churches became the True Dutch Reformed Church. The denomination then endured several name changes until 1904 when it adopted its present name, the Christian Reformed Church (CRC). The CRC began as a Dutch immigrant church in the 1850s and continued to attract mainly Dutch constituents. The church population has increased at times of heavy Dutch immigration. The church in Canada gained new members after an influx of people from the Netherlands following World War II. The CRC has also gained members who were unhappy with and left the RCA for various reasons. For example, some people who were unhappy with the RCA's decision to permit members to join the Freemasons united with the CRC in the 1880s. On the other hand, the CRC also lost several congregations in 1882 that supported the Freemasons.  Post-Secession  Haan continued to preach in the newly founded CRC until his death in 1874. Some of his children and many of his grandchildren and great-grandchildren became leaders in the CRC. Most of the congregations consisted of immigrants. Therefore services were held in the Dutch language in the early years. By the turn of the 20th century, CRC congregations could be found in several US states with services held in both Dutch and English. Haan died in 1874 of liver disease in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Mayhill Garden City started in 1914 as an experimental row of six houses that are still in occupation today as even numbers 2 to 12 Islwyn Road. The majority of homes were built by 1940. Maps from 1874, 1879, and 1921 confirm that prior to the Mayhill Garden City project, Townhill Farm occupied the upper end of Waun Wen Road and a well used by Baptists was located halfway down. At the end of what is now called Long Ridge (previously called Bryon Crescent) there was, and still is, a Jewish burial ground. Waun Wen Road was completed before 1938. Mayhill is geographically divided into Mayhill South (Mayhill Garden City) and Mayhill North (Mountain View) by Townhill Road. Prominent roads in Mayhill South include Waun Wen Road, Islwyn Road, and Nicander Parade. Prominent roads in Mayhill North include Mayhill Road, and Emlyn Road. Politically, Mayhill falls within the Townhill ward.Townhill Ward Profile The south side of Mayhill overlooks the city centre, docklands and Swansea Bay. A prominent landmark on Mayhill, visible from the city centre and Hafod is Sea View Primary School (previously known as Mayhill Primary). The north side of Mayhill looks out towards the northern districts of Swansea and onwards towards the mountainous terrain of the Brecon Beacons. Mayhill consists mostly of suburban housing, however it does also feature a post office on Townhill Road, several fast food establishments, hair dressers, and convenience stores, including a collection of shops at the intersection of Mayhill Road and Townhill Road. There are several churches in Mayhill including Our Lady of Lourdes, a popular Roman Catholic church, and Hill URC Church. Lifepoint Church also congregate at the Mountain View Family Centre. As of April 2018, Mountain View Health Centre has opened in Mayhill North; providing GP services as well as family clinics. A dedicated pharmacy and family centre have also been built on site. Mayhill features several park and nature reserve areas, including Bryn y Don and an unnamed Site of Special Scientific Interest (locally known as 'The Plots') on the border of Townhill, opposite to the Our Lady of Lourdes church. The largest open space recreational area is located around Sea View Primary School and includes parkland, small wooded areas, and heathland. There is also a small picnic park located along Bryn Y Don Road, and woodland between Waun Wen Road and Townhill Road. The Friends of Mayhill Washing Pond group has been established to look after the historically important Mayhill Washing Pond, located in Mayhill South.

The area is centred on the main road, called Mount Pleasant, immediately to the north of Swansea city centre, which connects the city centre to the Townhill and Mayhill districts to the north. It falls within the Castle ward. Description The area consists mainly of suburban housing located on the steep south-eastern slopes of Townhill. The demographic of the area has changed in recent years, and there is a substantial student population. In 2014 local residents complained about anti-social behaviour, blaming it mainly on immigrants and asylum seekers brought to live in the area by the local authority. In February 2015, police reported that the problem had been resolved by more frequent patrolling. University The University of Wales Trinity Saint David (UWTSD), formerly Swansea Metropolitan University and before that the West Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education, has one of its campuses on the main Mount Pleasant road. The university was created in 2010 and also incorporates the former Swansea College of Art, founded in 1853, which retains accommodation in Alexandra Road. Part of Swansea Metropolitan University's Mount Pleasant Campus Thoroughfare Mansell Street, De La Beche Street, Grove Place, and Alexandra Road cross the southern fringes of the area as a continuous thoroughfare. Located on this thoroughfare are Swansea Magistrates' Court, Swansea Central police station, Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, the old Swansea Central Library, and the building housing the arts wing of the university. Alexandra Road is a designated conservation area, and consists of a number of buildings which were constructed between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The road has a number of shops, including a new Tesco Express, opened in 2008. Businesses Established businesses in the main Mount Pleasant street and Terrace Road include a café, and a hairdressing salon. Terrace Road Primary School was opened in 1888 and has approximately 300 pupils. History A workhouse opened in Mount Pleasant in 1862, between what was known as \\"Gibbethill\\" and a lower slope known as \\"Poppithill\\". In 1895, it held 584 inmates in extended buildings. It was later called Tawe Lodge, and eventually became Mount Pleasant Hospital in 1929, when it was taken over by Swansea County Borough Council. The hospital closed in 1995 and was converted to accommodation for students. Hospital records are now held by the West Glamorgan Archive Service, as are records of the original Swansea Poor Law Union from 1842 to 1960. Mount Pleasant Baptist Church is located on the Kingsway, one of the city's busiest roads, and was built in 1825, when the street was named Gower Street. Christmas Evans preached at its opening service in the following year. It was nevertheless built to accommodate the needs of the English speakers in the congregation of the former Back Lane chapel, when it divided following the death of its minister Joseph Harris (Gomer). It would be one of the few notable buildings in the centre of the town to survive the bombing of the Second World War.

Free radicals are formed upon splitting the carbon-carbon bond. Free radicals are extremely reactive and short-lived. When a free radical in a polymer chain undergoes a beta scission, the free radical breaks two carbons away from the charged carbon producing an olefin (ethylene) and a primary free radical, which has two fewer carbon atoms. In organic synthesis, beta scission can be used to direct multistep radical transformations. For example, beta-scission of a weak C-S bond was used to favor one of two equilibrating radicals in metal free conversion of phenols to aromatic esters and acids via C-O transposition.Baroudi, A.; Alicea, J.; Flack, P.; Kirincich,J.; Alabugin, I.

It lies from Sulechów, or northeast of the Zielona Góra city centre. The airport is situated in the village of Kramsko, near the town of Babimost, west of Poznań (population 581,000), east from the German border, and from the center of Berlin. The airport's catchment area consists of 3 million inhabitants of the Lubusz Land () and western Greater Poland (Wielkopolska). The airport is the 14th busiest in Poland, or last among currently functioning with scheduled traffic. It has recently been taken over from the Polish Army by the regional authorities, but it is run by the state enterprise Porty Lotnicze (PPL), the operator of Warsaw's airport. There is a dispute, whether a separate company created by the regional authorities should take over the management of the airport, as the PPL is managing it without any commercial success. History The airport is a former military base. Its construction started in 1954. Airport began its service on 10.10.1957. A MiG-15 is parked adjacent to the terminal building, reflecting the former airport’s military origins.Google Maps image, accessed 2018-08-28 First passenger terminal was opened in 1977, but even before some passenger flights already operated from the airport. One of such first passenger flights took place in 1961 (21.07.1961), carrying Jurij Gagarin on his visit to Zielona Góra. It has a record of serving domestic traffic to and from Warsaw and Gdańsk since 1977. First flights were served 2 times weekly to Warsaw, Gdańsk route was also operated in the 1970-ties. The airport operated passenger traffic (2 connections daily) between Warsaw and Zielona Góra until September 2004, when, after 33 years of service, the state-owned Polish Airlines LOT discontinued the route, following ownership changes at the airport: The army stopped using it as its military base and dismantled some of its equipment. After the army left the airport in 2004, the property was rented to the regional authorities in 2005, so that the airport new owner could start developing the airport. Massive shifts in the Polish airline market caused financial problems for the former monopolist state-owned carrier LOT, resulting in suspension of the Warsaw service, because LOT could not find suitable mid-sized aircraft for this route. Recently this has changed, and since the end of 2005, two daily flights to Warsaw were operated by Jet Air for LOT, later reduced to one. As of 2008 Jet Air was the second airline serving the airport, without any ties to LOT. The local government subsidized these flights so that they may take place at all. In the following years, the airport served multiple destinations in domestic traffic: new routes to Gdańsk and Kraków were opened, an international connection to Dresden was opened in summer 2009, but all these destinations were discontinued. The flights to Warsaw operated with intermediate stops in Poznań or Bydgoszcz. List of former destinations include: Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań, Bydgoszcz, Dresden. There is no international traffic at the airport, except for charter services to southern Europe. Such charter flights took place in September and October 2015. In summer season 2015 the airlines flying to and from the airport served 8 charter routes as well as regular flights. New charter operations were performed by Enter Air, Small Planet Airlines, SUNExpres. Destinations served in 2015 included: Antalya (Turkey); Maiorka and Tenerife (Spain); Korfu, Rodos, Kos (Greece); Agadir (Maroko); Dubrovnik (Chorvatia). In 2016 the airport served occasional charter flight to Las Palmas and to Lviv in Ukraine. The idea of attracting international traffic, in the form of cargo flights, for the region of western Wielkopolska and Lubusz Land has resulted in a signed agreement between the local government and the management, but nothing concrete came of that yet. In January 2017, it has been announced that the airports only scheduled route to Warsaw Chopin Airport will be handed over from SprintAir to LOT Polish Airlines. As of 2020 the airport only sees a regular service to Warsaw Chopin Airport operated by LOT Polish Airlines and a seasonal service to Antalya Airport operated by Onur Air however, Onur Air does not advertise or sell tickets for the flight. Airport infrastructure =Runway= Zielona Góra Airport has a single asphalt-concrete runway in the direction of 06/24. The runway is 2,500 m long, 60 meters wide and it is equipped with a modern ILS CAT I allowing aircraft to land in foggy weather. Airport elevation is 59.0 m. The runway has two exit taxiways leading to two parking aprons where up to 10 middle-sized aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus 321) can be parked. The airport also has an apron used in winter for the de-icing of aircraft. Fuel available: Avgas 100 LL, Jet A1, fuel capacities: Avgas 100 LL - 7.500 l, Jet-A 1 - 18.000 l, fire safety protection: Category VI. Light navigation of the runway: Direction 24 - standard 900 m high-intensity approach lighting system with centerline sequenced flashers (category I). Visual system: 4-light PAPI on left (3.00 degrees glide path) on both directions (24 and 06). New light navigation of the runway - Cat. 1. NDB: 390 kHz „BBM”, DVOR/DME ZLG : 110,650 MHz =Passenger terminals= Zielona Gora Airport has two passenger terminals (T1 and T2), of which only Terminal T2 is fully functional and has a large capacity. The airport possesses a passenger terminal T1 of a modest capacity of 150,000 passengers yearly. This is a medium-sized passenger terminal T1 used for departures. Terminal T1 was built in 1977 and is currently being used for departures (passport control and boarding). In 2015, a new passenger terminal (arrivals hall T2) was constructed, increasing the airport capacity to serve passenger traffic. Terminal T2 is used for arrivals and charter services. There is no check-in or any other airport services in Terminal T2. The old terminal, called Terminal T1, has 2 check-in desks, basic luggage transport, and sorting facility and a medium-sized departure area with 1 or 2 gates. However, after the completion of the new arrival area, the maximum capacity of the airport is estimated at 0,3 million passengers per year. The post-military airport ranks second in Poland in terms of its infrastructure surface, such as taxiways and aprons, and has a good quality concrete runway . It is specified as PCN 45/R/B/W/T. The airport can handle up to 10 Boeing 737s on its taxiways and aprons (apron size: ). The main apron has 10 positions, including 10 positions for class B 737 (569m x 94m). There is also a smaller apron in front of the main terminal building. In total there are 6 separate aeroplane parking spots. In September and October 2015 the airport took over the charter operations from Poznan- Lawica airport that was undergoing runway renovation at that time. To serve increased passenger traffic, new parking lots were temporarily arranged, and a new terminal was opened for passenger traffic. =Cargo terminals= There is a small cargo terminal located next to the passenger terminal T1. The airport served cargo flights in the past, there is no data on current cargo operations from the airport. There are plans to increase cargo operations in the future. Airlines and destinations The following airlines serve regular scheduled and charter services to and from Zielona Góra: The nearest larger international airport is Poznań–Ławica Airport approx. 95 km to the east. Ground transportation =Bus= Bus service operates between the city of Zielona Góra and the Airport and its service is adjusted to flights' departure and arrival time. Departure from Main Bus Station (Dworzec PKS) and Airport, including few stops on route in the city. There is also a minibus service to Gorzów Wielkopolski that needs to be booked in advance. One can reach Airport by other bus operators with a stop in Nowe Kramsko village, some 1,5 km from the airport (15 minutes walking distance), that is served by local bus companies (Dami, PKS Zielona Góra) quite frequently. =Road= Land connections to Poznań (the largest city in the area) use the newly opened motorway (its junction lies northeast of the airport terminal), as well as the newly renovated railway line (Zbąszynek, an important rail terminus for the regional trains from Poznań, lies from the airport). =Rail= There exists a railroad spur next to the terminal that can be used for passenger service. Alternatively, it has been proposed that a train station be put on the well- frequented electrified rail line connecting Zielona Góra with Poznań, that passes only from the terminal. The trip to Poznań by train would then take less than an hour. There is an ongoing debate, whether the airport should be connected to a regional rail system by constructing a 2-km rail line that would connect the existing airport branch rail line with the passenger terminal. Local authorities are against such plans. The airport has an unused rail station that is located at the eastern side of the runway. There is a 2 km distance between the exiting but disused rail station and the terminals of the airport. In many similar airports (Lublin, Olsztyn- Szymany, Szczecin- Goleniów) the rail connections to the airports are already operated or will soon be opened for passenger traffic.

Allbaugh (born July 27, 1952) is an American political figure in the Republican Party. After spending most of his career in Oklahoma and Texas, Allbaugh came to national prominence working for Texas governor George W. Bush and helping manage his 2000 presidential election campaign. Allbaugh then became Bush's Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) beginning in February 2001. He served until FEMA's transfer into the newly created Department of Homeland Security, after which he resigned in March 2003.Joe Allbaugh Big Man on Campaign, Washington Post, Dan Balz.

New York Times, September 14, 2001, p. A19. He went on to earn a degree in political science from Oklahoma State University where he became a member of Beta Theta Pi (ΒΘΠ) Fraternity. His first paid political job was working for Oklahoma Senator Henry Bellmon in 1974. After working on the field staff of the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1984, Allbaugh returned to Oklahoma to help Bellmon win a race for governor in 1986.Balz, Dan. \\"The Governor's 'Iron Triangle' Points the Way to Washington\\".

Los Angeles Times, January 5, 2001, p. A16. The George W. Bush campaigns In 1994, Allbaugh was brought to Texas by George W. Bush to manage his campaign for governor. After Bush's victory, Allbaugh worked as gubernatorial chief of staff, serving until 1999 when he shifted posts to become campaign manager in Bush's run for the presidency. In this capacity Allbaugh was a key member of a tight circle of aides, together with Karl Rove and Karen Hughes, that the media dubbed the \\"Iron Triangle\\". Allbaugh called the trio \\"the brain, the brawn and the bite\\", with himself as the brawn at 6 feet 4 inches and 275 pounds. After Bush secured the Republican nomination, he chose Dick Cheney to lead the process of screening and selecting a running mate. Allbaugh ended up with the responsibility of vetting Cheney himself when Bush focused directly on Cheney as his choice for Vice President, rather than as the man to simply help with the choice.Nagourney, Adam and Frank Bruni. \\"Gatekeeper to Running Mate: Cheney's Road to Candidacy\\". New York Times, July 28, 2000, p. A1. The screening process was subsequently called into question when Cheney's Halliburton stock options, along with his sparse voting record in state and local elections, came to light. A Cheney spokeswoman defended Allbaugh's vetting process, saying it \\"was as thorough, if not more thorough than what other candidates went through.\\" It remained unclear whether Cheney had filled out a questionnaire he had given the other potential running mates, which dealt with these issues among other topics.Walsh, Edward. \\"Did Cheney Pass His Own Test?; Questions on Voting, Stock Options Topped His Screening List\\". Washington Post, September 24, 2000, p. A13.

It brought up policy issues that would arise again under Michael D. Brown Allbaugh's former deputy and FEMA successor, after Hurricane Katrina. The Bush administration also proposed cuts to FEMA's budget and the National Flood Insurance Program.Slater, Eric. \\"FEMA Director Tours Davenport Devastation\\". Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2001, p. A31.

New York Times, June 21, 2002, p. A22. In May 2001, Bush announced that FEMA would expand its responsibility to include government response to terrorist attacks.

The supplemental appropriation was needed to pay for-profit prison corporations CoreCivic and GEO Group to hold overflow inmates, salaries for uniformed staff, which are extremely low, and prisoner medical bills. The DOC must adhere to mandated standards regarding inmate services to remain in constitutional compliance.Tulsa World Editorial: Fix this! DOC running out of money, Tulsa World, March 2, 2016.

With the threat it would lock out 2,600 Oklahoma prison inmates, the owner of Oklahoma’s largest private prison successfully lobbied the legislature for a raise this year, the Frontier reports. The GEO Group’s sprawling Lawton Correctional Facility holds about 10 percent of Oklahoma’s prison population. With Oklahoma’s prisons operating at 114 percent capacity, the private corrections company has the bargaining power to ask the state for more money. In June, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections signed a five-year deal with The GEO Group to house inmates in Lawton that contained a rate increase worth an estimated $2.8 million. Florida's GEO Group hasn’t consistently met the terms of its Oklahoma contract. The for-profit prison operator frequently failed its contractual contract violations at its Lawton, Oklahoma prison, one that houses some of Oklahoma’s most dangerous prisoners. The Oklahoma DOC notified GEO regarding multiple violations at the Lawton Correctional Facility in 2017 and 2018, including the delayed releases of several offenders, the improper use of restraints, missing or improperly recorded prisoner counts, and failure to adhere to medication and nursing protocols. In 2017, the DOC fined GEO Group $380,000 for delaying the release of a Lawton prisoner by 304 late subsequent to the modification of his sentence. The GEO Group has a history of problems with such improper releases at Lawton, said Allbaugh: \\"Private prisons do not run their facilities to our standards, but they are supposed to adhere to our operational protocols.\\" \\"The only way you can get their attention is financial sanctions.\\"Private Prison Operator GEO Wins Oklahoma Raise Despite Violations, Crime and Justice News, July 9, 2018.

It is 60 km from Panaji by road and is located on the Madgaon-Belagavi rail route about 46 km east of Madgaon and 80 km south of Belagavi. Dudhsagar Falls is amongst India's tallest waterfalls with a height of 310 m (1017 feet) and an average width of 30 metres (100 feet). The falls is located in the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park among the Western Ghats. The waterfall forms the border between Karnataka and Goa states. The falls is a punctuation mark in the journey of the Mandovi River from the Western Ghats to Panjim where it meets the Arabian sea. The area is surrounded by deciduous forests with rich biodiversity. This waterfall is also known as Tambdi Surla to some of the local people. The falls are not particularly spectacular during the dry season but during the monsoon season, however, the falls are fed by rains and form a huge force of water. Access to the falls is as follows The nearest rail station accessible by road to the falls is Castle Rock, Uttara Kannada, Karnataka. Visitors could get in a train from here and disembark at the Dudhsagar stop. The Dudhsagar rail stop is not a station where passengers can expect a platform. Passengers and visitors have to climb down the steep ladder of the rail compartment in a short 1-2 minute unscheduled stop. From this rail stop, visitors have to walk about a kilometre on the tracks to arrive at the falls. While the walk itself is something unexpected for a popular tourist destination, there is a 200 m train tunnel that is totally dark which makes the walk a bit tougher. Recently Indian Railways has banned people from boarding/deboarding passengers at Dudhsagar railway.http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/visiting-dudhsagar- falls-trekking-along-the-rail-route-may-be-a-bad-idea/article7489165.ece One can reach the Dudhsagar Waterfalls with the help of Bhagwan Mahavir Wildlife sanctuary Taxi near a Goan Village called Molem. This Association will take you through lush green forest and some heavy flowing streams and get back to you same place. Currently, this is the only access to the Waterfall. The plus point of going through Association is One can see the full view of Dudhsagar Waterfall whereas if you go by Indian Railway you will see half of the waterfall view only. Dudhsagar Trek There has been a lot of hype of Dudhsagar trek being closed for the general public. The Dudhsagar railway trek has been officially closed for the general public but the trek to the Dudhsagar falls bottom is still open for all. There are two routes to reach there. One is starting the trek from Kulem and follow the jeep trail until the bottom of the waterfall. The second option is via the railway track which is roughly around 11 km. You can trek up to the Sonaulim station and join back to the Mud route. This route would save 2 km on the Mud road. During the monsoon season, it is mandatory to hire a guide and get a life jacket in order to start the trek otherwise the entry inside the forest is restricted because the area experiences extremely heavy rainfall and the water displacement around the fall are potentially very large, so it is always better to carry a life jacket.

For the next three years, Shearer was director of jazz bands at Wayne State University in Detroit.

These develop into fruits containing the edible seeds. In corn (maize), it is protected by leaves called husks. In some species (including wheat), unripe ears contribute significantly to photosynthesis, in addition to the leaves lower down the plant.

It is situated in the south-west of the city, bordering South Staffordshire and the Tettenhall Wightwick, Park, Graiseley and Penn wards. It forms part of the Wolverhampton South West constituency. Merry Hill is itself is the main focal point of the ward, situated at the junction of five main roads. Because of the layout of the ward boundaries, parts of the suburbs of Bradmore, Castlecroft and Finchfield are covered by Merry Hill ward. The population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 12,189. Highfields Secondary school, Uplands Junior school, St Michael's RC Primary school and Springdale Primary school are all situated within the ward.  History  Merry Hill once had a large house with surrounding gardens and an orchard which was named Bellencroft. The house has been demolished for a long while and the gardens no longer exist, instead a street named Bellencroft Gardens is in their location. Where the house once existed are now 2-3 private homes. The orchard of Bellencroft is now a cul-de-sac named Orchard Crescent which leads to Orchard Court. All that remains of Bellencroft is the pillar from the entrance to the driveway and until recently had the original 'Bellencroft' text on one of them. The text began to peel off and has been replaced with a modern plaque also saying 'Bellencroft'. The house was originally named 'Bhylls House', also being located on the street named 'Bhylls Lane'. The name was changed by the owner to incorporate his daughters' names, 'Bella' and 'Ellen'. Three multi-storey blocks of flats were erected at Merry Hill, on the edge of the Highfields estate, in 1967. They have dominated the local scene ever since. There is also a Public house called the Merry Hill.

Produced in 1975, and first broadcast in 1976, it was filmed at Bray Studios and on location in Windsor and Bracknell, Berkshire, and Black Park, Buckinghamshire. The series was partly financed by a German company, Werbung im Rundfunk (Advertising in Broadcasting), which dealt with distributing funding from the limited commercials shown on West German public TV. In this case, it was acting on behalf of the channel ZDF, which showed the series in West Germany. Overview The series presents a \\"battle of the sexes\\" and role reversal scenario in which male protagonists must escape servitude to women of an advanced civilization. The planet Medusa, home to a highly evolved and technologically advanced humanoid race, was already ruled by its women when a rogue comet knocked it out of its orbit of Proxima Centauri. Drifting through space, the orphan planet's surface became uninhabitable, and the inhabitants survived by building underground cities. The series begins with Medusa's entry into Earth's solar system. At first heartened to discover Earth, the Medusans are disappointed to learn that the human men are dominant there. Two Medusan men escape by stealing a ship and flying to Earth.http://www.sf- encyclopedia.com/entry/star_maidens Despite a successful escape, the two are pursued by the Medusan security forces. When the Medusans fail to re-capture the two men, they bring two human hostages--a man and a woman--back with them to their home planet. The series' 13 episodes concern the two groups' attempts to adapt to life on the different planets while brokering an exchange for the hostages. In the series finale, the Medusans' ship is pursued by another spacecraft, this one belonging to an alien race that has hunted Medusans in the past. Despite their technology and the antagonism they displayed throughout the series, the Medusans prove incapable of actually fighting an enemy, and only the intervention of a Medusan ship flown by an Earth man defeats the enemy. The saved Medusans return home, likely with an altered opinion of men. Regarded as something of a camp novelty, it does feature some female dominance elements. The series has some similarities with the British science-fiction series Space: 1999, whose second season was in pre production at Pinewood around the same time. Although Star Maidens was shot at Bray Studios by a different production company and did not benefit from as large a budget, both series featured the work of production designer Keith Wilson, whose props and set designs from Space: 1999 were adapted for Star Maidens, leading to a very similar look and feel. Even many of the sound effects from Space: 1999 were used. Lead actresses Judy Geeson and Lisa Harrow appeared in guest roles in the first season of Space: 1999, Geeson in the episode \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" and Harrow in \\"The Testament of Arkadia\\". For the series' German dub, German natives Christiane Krüger and Christian Quadflieg provided their own voices, while the voices of the British cast were dubbed by other German actors.

On 16 April 2005, he was formally appointed as Finance Minister again, leaving the post of Higher Education Minister;Michael Hartnack, \\"Mugabe announces new cabinet\\", Associated Press, 18 April 2005. \\"MP's sworn in, new ministers appointed\\", SADOCC, 16 April 2005. this followed the March 2005 parliamentary election, in which Murerwa was elected to the House of Assembly from Goromonzi constituency.David Blair, \\"Mugabe 'conjures up' winning votes\\", Daily Telegraph, 8 April 2005. Murerwa engineered the historic repayment of USD $120 million (out of $300 million) in debt to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), prior to their enforcement of a threat to expel Zimbabwe from the IMF for nonpayment of arrears (31 August 2005). Commenting on his country's accomplishment, he stated that it proved \\"that no one can write off Zimbabwe as yet\\" and that we \\"can still do things on our own.\\" This repayment has put Zimbabwe in an excellent position to move forward on loan talks with neighbour South Africa for a loan of between US$200 and US$500 million. During his tenure Zimbabwe's economy shrunk by 30% between 2000 and 2004 following the seizure of about 4,500 white-owned commercial farms which sent agricultural production plummeting. Inflation, at 164.3% in June 2005, increased to 254.8% in July 2005, creating a speed-bump on the road to the government's goal of bringing inflation down to 80% by year end. Murerwa recently presented a supplementary budget to pay wages, import food and build new housing, after admitting that targets for economic growth and inflation would be missed. Inflation was at 1193% in July 2006 making it the highest inflation rate in the world outside the war zones. Many people viewed Murerwa as the reason why the Zimbabwean economy was struggling due to his 'yes my lord' approach towards President Robert Mugabe. This was aggravated by the fact that he opposed the currency reforms initiated by Gideon Gono, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe director, in August 2006. Before that Murerwa wanted to introduce $250,000 bearer cheque during the absence of Gono which would have fuelled the inflation rate further only to be stopped by Mugabe. During his Fiscal Policy Review on 16 August 2005 Murerwa said, \\"Bringing down inflation, initially to double digit, and ultimately to single digit levels remains our objective. The disinflation process will, however, not be smooth sailing. Addressing the prevailing high inflation challenges facing us demands that we all make sacrifices, with Ministries living within our economy's means. There will simply be no magic solutions to our challenges.\\" He also commented on corruption, saying it \\"negatively affects the social and moral fabric of the nation, encouraging indiscipline and rent seeking behaviour – with the resultant hardships largely falling on the poor. It causes major costs to business activities and, hence, the introduction of various measures and institutions to decisively deal with this problem. In this regard, Government, in consultation with stakeholders, has announced the appointment of members of the Anti-Corruption Commission. Prohibitive penalties for corrupt practices are being considered, including the intensification of awareness campaigns of all existing Whistle Blower Funds. In the case of upholding the integrity of officers at the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, Government has initiated ongoing measures to nip all corrupt tendencies at border posts. Already, a number of criminal activities have been unearthed with several officers under investigation and prosecution. Similar exercises are being extended to other Government departments, including Immigration, VID, CMED, the Registrar General's Office.\\" As part of a much-anticipated cabinet reshuffle by President Robert Mugabe, Murerwa lost his cabinet post on 6 February 2007.\\"Mugabe retains old guard during shuffle\\", Reuters, 7 February 2007. This followed a public spat with Reserve bank Governor Gideon Gono over fiscal policies. According to the Zimbabwe Times the Reserve Bank governor took the unprecedented step of attacking Murerwa in lengthy statements published in the government-owned press as advertisements. Mugabe appeared to side with Gono, leaving the minister exposed. Murerwa and Gono had apparently taken opposing views on the issue of payments made by the Reserve Bank for various services offered to the Government of Zimbabwe. In a brief telephone conversation with The Times, Murerwa said that he did not want to make any comments over the issue of his departure from cabinet. \\"I do not want to comment. Why should I?\\" he asked before ending the conversation. It was thought that Muerwa might be keeping silent on the issue in the expectation that he could be tapped to replace the ailing Stan Mudenge as Minister of Tertiary Education. Murerwa was nominated as ZANU-PF's candidate for the Senate seat from Goromonzi, in Mashonaland East, in the March 2008 parliamentary election.\\"Zimbabwe: Zanu-PF Names Poll Candidates\\", The Herald, 15 February 2008. He narrowly won the seat according to official results, receiving 16,156 votes against 15,287 for Vincent Gwarazimba of the Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai faction and 4,560 for Marimo Cloudios of the MDC-Mutambara faction.\\"Zimbabwe senate election results\\" , Newzimbabwe.com.

On November 27, 2017, Emmerson Mnangagwa, who succeeded ousted President Robert Mugabe following the 2017 Zimbabwe coup d'etat, announced the dissolution of the Zimbabwe Cabinet, leaving only Patrick Chinamasa and Simbarashe Mumbengegwi as acting ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs respectively.

IIBR has many public projects on which it works with international research organizations (governmental and non-governmental) and universities. It has approximately 350 employees, 150 of whom are scientists. Its research findings are often published in national and international scientific publications. It is widely believed to be involved in the manufacturing of biological and chemical weapons. History IIBR originated with Hemed Bet, the Haganah biological warfare unit, which Alexander Kenyan, then a microbiology student, established in Jaffa in February 1948, shortly before Israeli independence, at the direction of Yigael Yadin, the Haganah's chief operations officer. Ephraim Katzir was Hemed Bet's first commander. The institute in its current form was founded in 1952, after Hemed Bet relocated to an orange grove near Ness Ziona. It was founded partly in a former Palestinian mansion of Wadi Hunayn.Traces of poison, Salman Abu-Sitta, 5 March 2003, Al-Ahram Among the founders were Professor Ernst David Bergmann, Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion's science adviser and the head of R&D; at the Ministry of Defense. Keynan was IIBR's first director. Some of the fields in which IIBR conducts research include: * Medical diagnostic techniques * Mechanisms of pathogenic diseases * Vaccines and pharmaceuticals * Protein and enzyme synthesis and engineering * Process biotechnology * Air pollution risk assessment * Environmental detectors and biosensors The institute is widely suspected of being involved in developing chemical and biological weapons. It is also assumed that the Institute develops vaccines and antidotes for such weapons. While refusing to confirm it, Israel is widely suspected of having developed offensive biological and chemical weapons capabilities, and the Israeli intelligence service Mossad is known to have used biological weapons in assassination missions. Israel has not signed the Biological Weapons Convention and has signed but not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. Marcus Klingberg, the highest-ranking spy for the Soviet Union ever caught in Israel, served as the IIBR's Deputy Scientific Director. He had joined the IIBR in 1957 and served as Deputy Scientific Director until 1972 as well as Head of the Department of Epidemiology until 1978. He was arrested in 1983 and convicted of espionage. His arrest and sentencing was kept a secret for over a decade. El Al Flight 1862, which crashed in the Netherlands in 1992, was carrying cargo destined for the Israel Institute for Biological Research which included 190 litres of dimethyl methylphosphonate, which (among many other uses) could be used in the synthesis of Sarin nerve gas, and is now a Chemical Weapons Convention schedule 2 chemical. Israel stated that the material was non-toxic, was to have been used to test filters that protect against chemical weapons, and that it had been listed on the cargo manifest in accordance with international regulations. The Dutch foreign ministry confirmed that it had already known about the presence of chemicals on the aircraft. According to the chemical weapons site CWInfo the quantity involved was \\"too small for the preparation of a militarily useful quantity of Sarin, but would be consistent with making small quantities for testing detection methods and protective clothing\\". According to British intelligence writer Gordon Thomas, the facility is surrounded by a high concrete wall topped with sensors, and armed guards patrol its perimeter. No aircraft are allowed to overfly the facility, and it does not appear on any map or telephone directory of the area. Inside the facility, code words and visual identification control access to each area, and there are numerous bombproof sliding doors that can only be opened by swipe cards whose codes are changed every day.

A first-party studio for Sony Interactive Entertainment, it is best known for developing the God of War series. The studio was founded in 1999 by Allan Becker and was originally located in Santa Monica, California, until relocating to Playa Vista in 2014.  History  Santa Monica Studio was founded in 1999 by Allan Becker, a long-time Sony employee who wanted \\"to break out of the corporate Foster City group\\" of Sony Computer Entertainment. The studio was established in an office next to the developer Naughty Dog before moving into a brick building in the suburbs of Santa Monica, California. The building at Penn Station would be occupied for fifteen years. For its first game, the racing title Kinetica, Santa Monica Studio decided to skip the PlayStation console and built the game for the console's then- upcoming successor, the PlayStation 2, instead. A game engine was developed \\"to give the [PlayStation 2] some legs\\" for Kinetica and future releases. While the game was developed during the studio's team building phase, producer Shannon Studstill focused on the game's release to prove to Sony that Santa Monica Studio was capable of delivering a product on schedule and within budget. Kinetica was released on time in 2001, with the studio staying under the allocated budget. After publication, Santa Monica Studio shifted to its next project, God of War, while re-using the engine from Kinetica. Within the Santa Monica offices, Santa Monica Studio acted as a business incubator for smaller video game studios, notably Thatgamecompany and its game Journey, which Santa Monica Studio co-developed. Other incubated teams include Broodworks, Eat Sleep Play, Fun Bits, Giant Sparrow, Incognito Entertainment, Q-Games, and Ready at Dawn. Becker left Santa Monica Studio in 2011. By March 2012, Becker had joined Sony's Japan Studio, while Shannon became Santa Monica Studio's \\"Senior Director of Product Development\\". In January 2014, Santa Monica Studio announced that it would from their Penn Station offices to The Reserve, a 20-acre facility on Jefferson Boulevard in Playa Vista, Los Angeles. The of office space were \\"four or five times the size\\" of their previous Santa Monica office, according to Studstill. At the time, the studio employed roughly 240 people. An undisclosed numbers of staffers were laid off in February that year due to the cancelation of a new intellectual property, including Stig Asmussen, who headed the canceled project. The studio relocation was completed on July 22, 2014, coupled with a new logo, dubbed SMS \\"Vanguard\\". In March 2020, Studstill left Santa Monica Studio to lead a new development studio under Stadia. Subsequently, a long-time employee and previous director of product development for Santa Monica Studio, Yumi Yang, was installed as the developer's studio head.

Loosely based upon the P.G. Wodehouse 1919 novel of the same name, and the 1928 stage play written by Wodehouse and Ian Hay, it has music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin, and was directed by George Stevens, the second (and last) Astaire musical directed by Stevens; the first was Swing Time. Plot Everyone on staff at Tottney Castle knows that the lovely Lady Alyce Marshmorton (Joan Fontaine) must marry soon, so a wager is proposed as to the identity of the lucky man. With all the likely candidates already claimed, young footman Albert (Harry Watson) places a bet on a \\"Mr. X,\\" someone totally out of the blue. Lady Alyce secretly has a romantic interest in an American no one from her family has yet met. She leaves the castle one day to venture into London, where by chance she encounters Jerry Halliday (Fred Astaire). He is an American entertainer, accompanied by press agent George (George Burns) and secretary Gracie (Gracie Allen), but he is not well enough known to be recognized by Lady Alyce. Jerry is incorrectly led to believe that he is the American that Lady Alyce is in love with. He goes to the castle, encouraged by Albert but discouraged by Keggs (Reginald Gardiner), a scheming butler whose money is on another beau. The closest Jerry can get to Lady Alyce is a castle tour, at least until Albert can sneak him upstairs. False impressions abound, as Jerry also fails to recognize Lady Alyce's father (Montagu Love), the lord of the manor. He is slapped in the face in a Tunnel of Love, misunderstanding the young lady's intentions entirely. In the end, however, he and Lady Alyce do find romance. The song \\"Things Are Looking Up\\" by George and Ira Gershwin appears in the film. Cast * Fred Astaire as Jerry * George Burns as George * Gracie Allen as Gracie * Joan Fontaine as Lady Alyce * Reginald Gardiner as Keggs * Ray Noble as Reggie * Constance Collier as Lady Caroline * Montagu Love as Lord Marshmorton * Harry Watson as Albert * Jan Duggan as Miss Ruggles Overview The film was made at George Gershwin's instigation, an enthusiasm that Wodehouse mischievously attributed to the fact that his novel was about a successful American songwriter named George Bevan. Gershwin died of a brain tumor while the film was in production. The picture was released four months after his death. For this, the first Astaire RKO film not to feature Ginger Rogers, the nineteen-year-old Fontaine was chosen. It soon emerged that Fontaine couldn't dance, but Stevens persuaded Astaire not to replace her with Ruby Keeler. The film was the first Astaire picture to lose money, costing $1,035,000 to produce and losing $65,000. Charley Chase was originally supposed to appear in the film as Jerry’s valet. However, he had to drop out due to poor health and his part was rewritten for Burns and Allen.Anthony, Brian; Edmonds, Andy (1997). Smile When The Raindrops Fall: The Story of Charley Chase. Scarecrow Press. . P. 166. The \\"Fun House\\" sequence garnered co-choreographer Hermes Pan the 1937 Academy Award for Best Dance Direction.

It is a royal temple of the first grade, one of ten such temples in Bangkok (23 in Thailand). Construction was begun by King Rama I in 2350 BE (1807 CE). In the beginning time it was called \\"Wat Maha Sutthawat\\" (วัดมหาสุทธาวาส) and located in the combretum grove. Further construction and decorations were carried out by King Rama II who helped carve the wooden doors, but the temple was not completed until the reign of King Rama III in 2390 BE (1847–1848 CE). This temple contains the Buddha image Phra Sri Sakyamuni (; ) which have been moved from Sukhothai Province. At the lower terrace of the base, there are 28 Chinese pagodas which symbolize the 28 Buddhas born on this earth. Wat Suthat also contains Phra Buddha Trilokachet (; ) in the ubosot (ordination hall) and Phra Buddha Setthamuni (; ) in the Sala Kan Parian (meeting hall). In 2005 CE, the temple was submitted to UNESCO for consideration as a future World Heritage Site. Preta of Wat Suthat Phra Si Sakyamuni is enshrined in the vihara, also known for its exquisite murals. The temple dating back to the beginning Rattanakosin Kingdom, it was a place where stories about undead according to the beliefs of Buddhism and Siamese, preta (, pret) are often depicted as a tall hungry ghost with a thin body and a scary howling cry. It was said that it often appears in front of the temple at night. Until it was said that \\"Pret Wat Suthat\\" () in pair with \\"Raeng Wat Saket\\" (, \\"vultures of Wat Saket\\"). However, it is believed that what people see as the preta of the Wat Suthat, probably comes from a misunderstanding about seeing the Sao Chingcha, or Giant Swing, a towering Hindu structure that stands in front of the temple at night with no more light. Besides, one mural in the ordination hall of this temple, also shows painting of one preta lying to feed water from the monks.

Life and career Mirvish was born in Toronto, Ontario. He owns and operates the Royal Alexandra Theatre, the Princess of Wales Theatre, the Ed Mirvish Theatre and the Panasonic Theatre, all in Toronto. From 2002 to 2005, he was on the Board of Trustees of the Royal Ontario Museum. He was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada. From 1963 through 1975, Mirvish operated a contemporary art gallery—the David Mirvish Gallery—specialising in the American abstract painters of the 1960s and 1970s known as the Color Field school.David Mirvish biography\\"York University\\", accessed December 9, 2008 He closed the gallery in 1975, but continues to buy and sell privately and to lend works to museums for exhibition. Mirvish Productions =Canadian theatre= In 1987, he took over direction of his father's 1497-seat Toronto theatre, the Royal Alexandra Theatre. For most of the theatre's history, it had functioned as a road house—a temporary venue for touring productions. In 1987, Mirvish founded the company Mirvish Productions for the purpose of producing and staging original works for the Royal Alexandra and, later, his new Princess of Wales Theatre (opened in 1993). Mirvish and Mirvish Productions enjoyed notable successes in this new venture as with the Canadian stagings of such musicals as Les Misérables (1989–1990), Miss Saigon (1993–1995), Crazy for You (1994–1995), Rent (1997–1998), The Lion King (2000–2004), We Will Rock You and The Sound of Music (opened October 2008). They also, however, endured losses with their sit-down productions of the large-scale musicals Tommy (1995), Jane Eyre (1996–1997), The Producers (2003–2004), Hairspray (2004). In 2005, he also joined in partnership with British theatre producer Kevin Wallace, American film producer Saul Zaentz and Canadian concert promoter Michael Cohl to produce The Lord of the Rings, a stage musical adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's fantasy trilogy. This production opened at the Princess of Wales Theatre in March 2006. Because of poor reviews and slow sales the show closed early. On June 28, 2006, Mirvish announced that Sept. 3, 2006 would mark the show's closing,\\"Lord Of The Rings Stage Production To Close in September\\",City News, June 28, 2006 and that he would be unable to fully repay its investors. With an estimated capitalisation of $28 million, The Lord of the Rings had been advertised as the most expensive stage production in North American history. =The Old Vic= Mirvish also operated the London, England, theatre the Old Vic (purchased and renovated by his father in 1982) from 1987 through 1998. In 1987, he installed Jonathan Miller as artistic director of The Old Vic and enjoyed a string of outstanding critical successes—including an Olivier Award for a production of the musical Candide, but, unfortunately, three straight years of financial loss. In 1990, Mirvish terminated Miller's contract over budget issues, earning much negative criticism in the British press. In 1997, Mirvish appointed Sir Peter Hall as artistic director of the Old Vic and, again, enjoyed critical acclaim with such productions as The Master Builder with Alan Bates and Waiting for Godot with Ben Kingsley, but continuing financial loss. Within a year of the appointment, Mirvish terminated Hall's contract—again to much negative comment in the press—and put the Old Vic up for sale. The theatre was subsequently (1998) purchased by a theatres trust, The Old Vic Theatre Trust.McGillivray, Peter.\\"London's 180- Year -Old Vic Saved by Trust\\",AllBusiness, July 24, 1998 Real estate In 2000, Mirvish began a new business venture as a real estate developer and began construction of a large condominium complex in downtown Toronto, known as One King West. The building opened for occupancy in 2005. In March 2008 Mirvish announced the acquisition of the Panasonic and Canon Theatres in Toronto from Key Brand Entertainment, which had itself purchased the theatres from Live Nation in February 2008.Brieger, Peter.\\"Mirvish to buy two downtown theatres\\", Toronto National Post, May 7, 2008 Mirvish had been operating the Canon Theatre under a 15-year lease signed in 2001 with Live Nation which gave him control over all bookings and management of the Canon. Mirvish acquired the theatre pursuant to a right of first offer contained in the same lease agreement. The purchase and sale triggered a lawsuit from rival Canadian presenter, Aubrey Dan, who had invested in Key Brand on the alleged promise that he would become manager of the Canon theatre. Dan sued both Mirvish and his own company, Key Brand, in an action which is still pending as of December 2008. The Canon was renamed The Ed Mirvish Theatre in honour of David Mirvish's late father on December 6, 2011. In August 2010, Mirvish announced that he would provide a 9,765 square foot space to Theatre Museum Canada, thus providing the largely online museum with its first permanent space for exhibition. On October 1, 2012, David Mirvish announced a partnership with renowned architect Frank Gehry to redevelop his family's considerable real estate holdings on King Street West in Toronto. The proposed project includes three distinct tall buildings, called by Mirvish as \\"sculptures that people would live in,\\" and a pedestal that would also house a new gallery devoted to Mirvish's extensive collection of abstract expressionist art and a new campus for the OCAD University. Should the project receive municipal zoning approval, it would be that the buildings currently on the site (four low-rise industrial and warehouse buildings and the Princess of Wales Theatre) would be demolished. The estimated time until completion is 10 years.Toronto Star, Oct. 6, 2012 Honours and awards Mirvish was made a member of the Order of Canada in 1995, and in 2001, the Order of Ontario.\\"Order of Canada\\", Governor General of Canada, accessed December 9, 2008 In 2004, he received an honorary degree from the University of Toronto.

Etymology The name probably comes from the Slavic *Mъchačь,*Mocháč: mъchъ (moss, Hungarian moha is a loanword from Slavic/) + the Slavic suffix -ačь, like Slovak Mochnáč or Czech Macháč. See 1093/1190/1388 Mohach. History Two famous battles took place there: # Battle of Mohács, 1526 # Battle of Mohács, 1687 These battles represented the beginning and end, respectively, of the Ottoman domination of Hungary. In Roman times there was a camp on the banks of the Danube near Mohács. In the medieval Kingdom of Hungary, Mohács was part of the historical Baranya county, and during Ottoman rule it was the administrative seat of the Sanjak of Mohács, an Ottoman administrative unit. After the Habsburgs took the area from the Ottomans, Mohács was included in the restored Baranya county. In 1910, the population of the Mohács district numbered 56,909 people, of whom 21,951 spoke German, 20,699 Hungarian, 4,312 Serbian, and 421 Croatian. Another 9,600 inhabitants were listed as speaking \\"other languages\\" (presumably Bunjevac and Šokac). Events Every spring, the town hosts the annual Busójárás carnival.

He is sometimes considered the father of Arabic poetry. His qaṣīda, or long poem, \\"Let us stop and weep\\" (Arabic: قفا نبك qifā nabki) is one of the seven Mu'allaqat, poems prized as the best examples of pre-Islamic Arabian verse. Imru' al-Qais was born in the Al Qassim region of northern Arabia sometime in the early 6th century AD. His father was said to be Hujr bin al-Harith ( / Ḥujr ibn al-Ḥārith), the Kindah monarchy's regent over the tribes of Asad and Ghatfan, and it is believed that Imru' al-Qais was born in the territory of Asad. His mother was said to be Fatimah bint Rabi'ah al-Taghlibi ( / Fāṭimah bint Rabī‘ah al-Taghlibī). Legend has it that Imru' al-Qais was the youngest of his father's sons, and began composing poetry while he was still a child. His father strongly disapproved of this habit in his son, believing poetry to be an unseemly pastime for the son of a king. His father also disapproved of Imru' al-Qais' scandalous lifestyle of drinking and chasing women, and eventually banished him from his kingdom, or so the legend goes. But later, when the tribe of Asad rebelled and assassinated his father, Imru' al-Qais was the only one of his brothers to take responsibility for avenging his death. Renouncing wine and women, he fought the tribe of Asad until he had exacted revenge in blood, and spent the remainder of his life trying to regain his father's kingdom. Like many figures of early Arabia, which at that time lacked a formal writing system and relied on the oral transmission of stories, the details of the life of Imru' al-Qais are hard to determine with any certainty. Even so, historians have been able to compare the various stories written down by later biographers with clues from Imru' al-Qais' own poems and information about major historical events in the Persian and Byzantine empires to reconstruct a probable account of the life and ancestry of this most famous of the Jahili poets. According to one account, his full name and ancestry was Imru' al-Qais, son of Hujr, son of al- Harith, son of 'Amr, son of Hujr the eater of bitter herbs, son of Mu'awiyya, son of Thawr of the tribe of Kindah (Arabic: ). He was also referred to as \\"The Lost King\\" ( / al-Malik aḍ-Ḍalīl), because he was never able to recover his father's throne. Name The name Imru' al-Qais (in classical Arabic nominative Imru'u l-Qays(i) or Imra'a l-Qays(i), accusative Imra'a l-Qays(i), genitive Imri'i l-Qays(i)) means \\"man of Qais\\", (al-)Qais being the name of a pre-Islamic deity.M.M. Bravmann (1977). Studies in Semitic Philology, p. 146. According to the Arabic-English Lexicon of Edward W. Lane (1863), the name is normally pronounced Imra-el-Ḳeys or Imr-el-Ḳeys in modern Arabic. Ancestry The tribe of Kindah had its origins in the South Arabia of and migrated north to Najd sometime in the 4th or 5th century AD. Sometime in the 5th century they asked the king of Yemen to select them a king, and Hujr Akil al-Murar (\\"eater of bitter herbs\\") became the first Kindite king.Makki 2005, p. 213 He was succeeded by his son 'Amr, who was succeeded by his son al-Harith, who was the greatest of all the Kindite kings. One of al-Harith's sons was Hujr, and he made him regent over the tribes of Asad and Ghatfan, and Hujr was the father of Imru' al-Qais.\\" Of al-Harith, it is told that when the Persian emperor Kavadh I adopted the teachings of the religious revolutionary Mazdak, al-Harith converted to Mazdakism with him. This caused Kavadh to make al- Harith king of the Hirah, a region in the south of modern-day Iraq, and expel his previous Arab vassal al-Mundhir. Kavadh's son Khosrau I rejected Mazdakism and rebuked al-Harith, restoring al-Mundhir to the throne of the Hirah. It is not known for sure how al-Harith died, but some reports indicate he was captured by al-Mundhir as he fled al-Hirah, and then killed along with two of his sons and more than forty of his kinsmen.\\"A Note on the Poet\\" Imru' al- Qais mourns this tragedy in one of the poems attributed to him: :Weep for me, my eyes! Spill your tears :And mourn for me the vanished kings :Hujr ibn 'Amru's princely sons :Led away to slaughter at eventide; :If only they had died in combat :Not in the lands of Banu Marina! :No water was there to wash their fallen heads, :And their skulls lie spattered with blood :Pecked over by birds :Who tear out first the eyebrows, then the eyes. :(Diwan, Poem 2) In 525 AD Yemen was occupied by the Negus (Emperor) of Axum (modern-day Ethiopia). With their sponsor destroyed, the Kindah monarchy quickly fell apart. It is probably during this period that the tribe of Asad rebelled and killed Imru' al-Qais' father, Hujr.http://www.almuallaqat.com/poetDetails.do?poetId=1 Early life Historians are divided as to the year of Imru' al-Qais' birth, but one estimate is that he was born sometime around 526 AD. He was said to be the youngest of the sons of Hujr, king over the tribes of Asad and Ghutfan. Some historians have pointed out that his father had other wives and concubines than his mother, in accordance with the custom of kings at this time, and it is possible that he received little fatherly attention.Makki 2005, p. 215 He began composing poetry from an early age, an activity that his father strongly disapproved of because it was not considered appropriate for the son of a king. Al-Tahir Ahmad Makki comments that \\"among the northern tribes, likewise, each tribe had its chief and its poet, and the two were hardly ever the same.\\" Another source of friction with his father was Imru' al-Qais' excessive dedication to lewd drinking parties and his scandalous pursuit of women. One story says that, concerned with his son's lack of responsibility, Hujr tried putting Imru' al-Qais in charge of the family's camel herds, an experiment which ended in disaster. Another story says that Hujr finally disowned his son after Imru' al-Qais publicly courted his cousin 'Unayzah, and after failing to win her hand in marriage, managed to enjoy her affections in secret, which caused a considerable scandal in the family. Yet other stories say that Imru' al-Qais may have written some lewd verses about his father's wives or concubines, and that this was the cause of their falling out. Whatever the reason, most of the stories agree that Hujr became exasperated with his son's behavior and expelled him from his kingdom. In his exile Imru' al-Qais wandered with his group of rebellious friends from oasis to oasis, stopping to drink wine, and recite poetry, and enjoy the performance of the singing-girls, sometimes tarrying for days before packing up to wander again. Imru' al-Qais' adventures with women also formed an important part of his early life, consisting according to some records of dozens of marriages, divorces and affairs, all ending badly for one reason or another. Imru' al- Qais' lovers feature large in his poetry, as he praises their graces, lambasts their cruelty, and laments their absence and the longing in his heart. The death of his father Some stories tell that Imru' al-Qais was in his father's army fighting the tribe of Asad when his father was slain, but this is not agreed by all the biographers. The most popular story comes to us from ibn al- Kalbi (d. 826 AD). Ibn al-Kalbi holds that Imru' al-Qais was still in exile at the time of his father's death, and that the news reached him while he was in the midst of a party with his friends. Upon hearing the news, he said \\"May God be merciful to my father. He let me stray when I was small, and now that I am grown he has burdened me with his blood. There will be no alertness today, and no drunkenness tomorrow,\\" followed by perhaps his most famous quote: \\"Today is for drink, and tomorrow for serious matters.\\" It is told that of all his father's sons, Imru' al-Qais was the only one to take responsibility for avenging his father.Makki 2005, p. 220 One story tells that the tribe of Asad sent him an emissary and offered him three options—either that he kill one of their nobles to equal the death of his father, or that he accept a payment of thousands of sheep and camels, or that he make war on them, in which case they asked for one month to make ready. Imru' al-Qais chose the third option. The tribes of Bakr and Taghlib agreed to support him and fought with him against Asad, killing many Asad tribesmen. Bakr and Taghlib withdrew their support once they judged that enough of Asad had been killed to satisfy the requirements of revenge. Exile and death After exacting his revenge upon the tribe of Asad and losing the support of Bakr and Taghlib, Imru' al-Qais travelled all over the Arabian peninsula and the Levant, taking refuge with different tribes, running from his enemies and seeking support to regain his father's kingship. His last journey was to Constantinople, to seek support from Emperor Justinian I. The Ghassanid prince Al-Harith ibn Jabalah, Justinian's north Arabian vassal, sponsored Imru' al-Qais in his appeal, and most accounts indicate that he won some promise of support from the Byzantine emperor, and perhaps even a contingent of troops. Some reports indicate that Justinian pressed the Negus of Axum to support Imru' al-Qais' bid, but that he refused due to the ongoing feud between the Axumite Empire and the tribe of Kindah. After leaving Constantinople, Imru' al-Qais travelled until he fell ill near the city of Ankara in modern-day Turkey. He remained there until he died. There is a story which says that Emperor Justinian became angry with Imru' al-Qais after he left, and sent a messenger with a poisoned jacket, and that Imru' al-Qais wore the jacket and the poison killed him. This story says that Justinian was angry because he discovered that Imru' al-Qais had an affair with a woman in his court.http://www.nashiri.net/index.php/articles/literature-and- art/5772-2015-05-23-10-17-30 However, most historians downplay the likelihood of this account, in favor of the story that Imru' al-Qais actually died from a chronic skin disease, a disease which he mentioned in one of his poems. The best estimates of the years of Imru' al-Qais' embassy to Justinian and death in Anatolia are from 561 to 565 AD. It has been said that after the death of Imru' al-Qais the Greeks made a statue of him on his tomb that was still seen in 1262 AD,Arabic theology, Arabic philosophy: from the many to the one, Richard M. Frank,James Edward Montgomery. p.60 and that his tomb is nowadays located in Hızırlık, Ankara. Poetic influences Makki summarizes the accounts of the biographers in identifying three older poets who Imru' al-Qais could have met and learned from. The first was Zuhayr bin Janab al-Kalbi, a well-known poet who was a friend and drinking companion of his father. It is also possible that Imru' al-Qais learned from Abu Du'ah al-Iyadi, and some accounts say that the young Imru' al-Qais was his reciter (a poet's disciple who would memorize all of his poems). A third possible poetic influence was a 'Amr bin Qami'ah who was a member of his father's retinue, and was said to have later joined Imru' al-Qais' retinue and accompanied him until his death. Religion Most historians in the centuries since Imru' al-Qais' death have been content with the assumption that, as an Arab before the advent of Islam, he was pagan. More recently some researchers have called this view into question, most notably Louis Shaykho (c. 1898), a Jesuit missionary, who insisted that Imru' al-Qais was a Christian. The evidence that Shaykho cites to support his claim consists mostly of a handful of references to Christian practices and symbols in Imru' al-Qais' poems, as well as a few instances of the Arabic word for (the one) God (Allah). Other historians have said that references to Christianity can be explained by the presence of monasteries and missionaries along the northern frontier of the Arabian peninsula, and the fact that many Arabs would have been impressed by these scenes without necessarily converting themselves. It can be explained by the fact that Arabs have been close to Jewish tribes since ancient times, too (Gindibu helped the Kingdom of Judah during the Battle of Qarqar) because of their ethnic similarity and geographic proximity. Others have pointed out that the word \\"Allah\\" was in use by the pagan Arabs long before the advent of Islam, and merely referred to the high God (above all the many others).Makki 2005, p. 216 Imru' al-Qais may have been a Hanif. Makki reports that some historians have suggested Imru' al-Qais could have been influenced by the purported Mazdakism of his grandfather, but also states that, in his opinion, there is little direct evidence to support this. Cultural impact To this day Imru' al-Qays remains the best-known of the pre-Islamic poets and has been a source of literary and national inspiration for Arabic intellectuals all the way into the 21st century. In his entry in the Dictionary of Literary Biography, Al- Tahir Ahmad Makki says this about Imru' al-Qais: :The Prince-Poet Imru' al- Qais, of the tribe of Kindah, is the first major Arabic literary figure. Verses from his Mu'allaqah (Hanging Poems), one of seven poems prized above all others by pre-Islamic Arabs, are still in the 20th century the most famous --and possibly the most cited--lines in all of Arabic literature. The Mu'allaqah is also an integral part of the linguistic, poetic and cultural education of all Arabic speakers.Makki 2005, p. 212 Ibn Sallam al-Jumahi (d. 846 AD) said of Imru' al-Qais in his \\"Generations of the Stallion Poets\\" (Arabic: ): :Imru' al-Qais was the originator of a great many things the Arabs considered beautiful, and which were adopted by other poets. These things include calling up his companions to halt, weeping over the ruins of abandoned campsites, describing his beloved with refinement and delicacy, and using language that was easy to understand. He was the first to compare women to gazelles and eggs, and to like horses to birds of prey and to staves. He 'hobbled like a fleeing beast' [a reference to his famous description of his horse] and separated the erotic prelude from the body of his poem. In the coining of similitudes, he surpassed everybody in his generation.Makki 2005, p. 222. Some historians have emphasized the historical significance of the Kindah monarchy as the first attempt to unite the central Arabian tribes before the success of Islam, and Imru' al-Qais' tragic place as one of the last Kindite princes. Others have focused on his colourful and violent life, putting it forward as an example of the immorality and brutality which existed in pre-Islamic Arabia. Iraqi writer Madhhar al-Samarra'i (Arabic: ) in his 1993 book Imru' al-Qais: Poet and Lover (Arabic: ), calls Imru' al-Qais the \\"poet of freedom\\": :The poet Imru' al-Qais had a gentle heart and a sensitive soul. He wanted the best not only for himself but for all the people of his society. The freedom that he struggled for was not confined to the romantic and erotic relations between him and his beloved Fatimah, and was not limited to his demands to lift the restrictions on sexual relations between men and women, but exceeded all this, so that he was singing for the freedom of all mankind-- and from this point we are able to name him, the Poet of Freedom.al- Samarra'i 1993, p. 40  See also  * Arabic literature Notes References * “A Note on the Poet: Imru’ al-Qais” [Arabic: ]. almoallaqat.com.

Ryholt, The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997, excerpts available online. or for a few months, c. 1760 BC or c. 1732 BC,Thomas Schneider: Lexikon der Pharaonen during the Second Intermediate Period. Hor is known primarily thanks to his nearly intact tomb discovered in 1894 and the rare life-size wooden statue of the king's Ka it housed. Attestations LACMA. Hor Awibre is mentioned on the Turin canon, a king list compiled in the early Ramesside period. The canon gives his name on the 7th column, line 17 (Gardiner entry 6.17 Alan H. Gardiner: The Royal Canon of Turin, Oxford 1959, Vol. III, 6.14, Warminster 1987, .). Beyond the Turin canon, Hor remained unattested until the discovery in 1894 of his nearly intact tomb in Dashur by Jacques de Morgan, see below. Further attestations of Hor have come to light since then, comprising a jar lid of unknown provenance and a plaque, now in the Berlin Museum, both inscribed with his name. Another plaque with his name was found at the pyramid of Amenemhat I at Lisht. There were found several faience plaques with 13th Dynasty king's names.Dieter Arnold: The Pyramid Complex of Amenemhat I at Lisht, The Metropolitan Museum of Art New York 2015, , p. 59, pl. 93 More importantly, a granite architrave with the cartouches of Hor and his successor Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw in close juxtaposition was uncovered in Tanis, in the Nile Delta. The architrave probably originated in Memphis and came to the Delta region during the Hyksos period. Based on this evidence, the egyptologist Kim Ryholt proposed that Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw was a son and coregent of Hor Awibre.  Reign According to Ryholt and Darrell Baker, Hor Awibre was the fifteenth ruler of the 13th Dynasty.Darrell D. Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300–1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 112-113-114 Alternatively, Detlef Franke and Jürgen von Beckerath see him as the fourteenth king of the dynasty.Thomas Schneider: Ancient Egyptian Chronology - Edited by Erik Hornung, Rolf Krauss, And David a. Warburton, available online, see p. 176Detlef Franke: Zur Chronologie des Mittleren Reiches (12.-18. Dynastie) Teil 1 : Die 12. Dynastie, in Orientalia 57 (1988)Jürgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der Zweiten Zwischenzeit in Ägypten, Glückstadt, 1964Jürgen von Beckerath: Chronologie des pharaonischen Ägyptens, Münchner Ägyptologische Studien 46. Mainz am Rhein, 1997 No evidence has been found that relate Hor to his predecessor on the throne, Renseneb, which led Ryholt and Baker to propose that he was an usurper. Hor Awibre's reign length is partially lost to a lacuna of the Turin canon and is consequently unknown. According to the latest reading of the Turin canon by Ryholt, the surviving traces indicate the number of days as \\"[... and] 7 days\\". In the previous authoritative reading of the canon by Alan Gardiner, which dates to the 1950s, this was read as \\"[...] 7 months\\".Alan Gardiner, editor. Royal Canon of Turin. Griffith Institute, 1959. (Reprint 1988. ) This led scholars such as Miroslav Verner and Darrell Baker to believe that Hor's reign was ephemeral, while Ryholt's reading leaves a longer reign possible and indeed Ryholt credits Hor with 2 years of reign. In any case, Hor most likely reigned only for a short time, in particular not long enough to prepare a pyramid, which was still the common burial place for kings of the early 13th dynasty. Regardless of the duration of his reign, Hor was seemingly succeeded by his two sons Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew. Tomb Drawing by Jacques de Morgan of the scepters and staves of Hor Awibre. Hor is mainly known from his nearly intact tomb, discovered in 1894 by Jacques de Morgan working in collaboration with Georges Legrain and Gustave Jequier in Dahshur.Jacques de Morgan: Fouilles a Dahchour, mars-juin, 1894, Vienna, 1895. Available online. The tomb was nothing more than a shaft built on the north-east corner of the pyramid of the 12th Dynasty pharaoh Amenemhat III. The tomb was originally made for a member of Amenemhat's court and was later enlarged for Hor, with the addition of a stone burial chamber and antechamber. Although the tomb had been pillaged in antiquity, it still contained a naos with a rare life-size wooden statue of the Ka of the king. This statue is one of the most frequently reproduced examples of Ancient Egyptian art and is now in the Egyptian Museum under the catalog number CG259. It is one of the best-preserved and most accomplished wooden statues to survive from antiquity, and illustrates an artistic genre that must once have been common in Egyptian art, but has rarely survived in such good condition. Plan of the tomb of king Hor The tomb also contained the partly gilded rotten wooden coffin of the king. The king's wooden funerary mask, its eyes of stones set in bronze, had been stripped of its gold gilding but still held the king's skull. Hor's canopic box was also found complete with its canopic vessels. The mummy of the king had been ransacked for his jewelry and only Hor's skeleton was left in his coffin. The king was determined to have been in his forties at the time of his death. Other artifacts from the tomb include small statues, alabaster and wooden vases, some jewelry, two alabaster stelae inscribed with blue painted hieroglyphs and a number of flails, scepters and wooden staves which had all been disposed in a long wooden case. These had been intentionally broken in pieces. The tomb also housed weapons such as a granite macehead and a golden-leaf dagger and numerous pottery. Next to the burial of Hor was found the totally undisturbed tomb of the 'king's daughter' Nubhetepti-khered. She was likely a daughter of HorDodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan.

He teaches widely in the West, often through songs of realization, his own as well as those composed by Milarepa and other masters of the past. \\"Tsültrim Gyamtso\\" translates to English as \\"Ocean of Ethical Conduct\\". Early life Rinpoche was born in 1934 to a nomad family from Nangchen, Kham (eastern Tibet). He left home at an early age to train with Lama Zopa Tarchin, who was to become his root guru. After completing this early training, he lived the ascetic life of a yogi, wandering throughout Tibet and undertaking intensive, solitary retreats in caves and living in charnel grounds practicing Chöd. At Tsurphu Monastery, the historic seat of the Karma Kagyu lineage, Rinpoche continued his training with the lineage head, the 16th Gyalwa Karmapa, and other masters. Exile in India During the 1959 Tibetan uprising Rinpoche fled Tibet, leading a group of Buddhist nuns over the Himalayas to safety in Bhutan. He subsequently went to northern India, where he spent the next nine years at the Buxa Duar Tibetan Refugee Camp. Here he studied and mastered Buddhist scholarship and was awarded a Khenpo degree by the 16th Karmapa and the equivalent Geshe Lharampa degree by the 14th Dalai Lama. At the direction of the Karmapa, he subsequently settled in Bhutan, where he built a nunnery, retreat center, and school. Teaching activities Along with Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche, Khenpo Rinpoche served as the principal teacher at the shedra (monastic college) at Rumtek Monastery, the seat of the Karmapa in exile. As such, he trained all of the major lineage holders of the Karma Kagyu lineage. He also taught extensively around the world. Rinpoche is also the principal teacher of the Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, and is very close to his Nalandabodhi organization. He also teaches extensively in the Shambhala Buddhist community. Rinpoche is also a primary teacher of Lama Shenpen Hookham, Rigdzin Shikpo Rinpoche and Lama Tashi Lhamo. =Shentong= Shentong views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality, agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is \\"empty\\" () only of \\"other\\" () relative phenomena, but is itself not empty. This absolute reality is the \\"ground or substratum\\" which is \\"uncreated and indestructible, noncomposite and beyond the chain of dependent origination.\\" Dolpopa identified this absolute reality with the Buddha-nature. The shentong-view is related to the Ratnagotravibhāga sutra and the Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis of Śāntarakṣita. The truth of sunyata is acknowledged, but not considered to be the highest truth, which is the empty nature of mind. Insight into sunyata is preparatory for the recognition of the nature of mind. Hookham explains the Shentong position, referring to Khenpo Tsultrim's Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness. Khenpo Tsultrim presents five stages of meditation, which he relates to five different schools or approaches: * \\"Sravaka meditation on non-self\\" - meditation on the emptiness of the skandhas and the non-existence of a personal self; * \\"Cittamatra-approach\\" - meditation on the mind-stream, the ever-continuing process of perception, and the non-duality of perceived and perceiver; * \\"Svatantrika-Madhyamaka approach\\" - meditation on all dhammas, which are empty of self-nature, and the negation of any \\"substance\\"; * \\"Prasangika-Mdhyamaka approach\\" - meditation on \\"the non- conceptual (nisprapanca) nature of both the appearance of phenomena and their self-emptiness.\\" In this approach, all concepts are to be abandoned; * Shentong (Yogacara Madhyamaka) - meditation on Paramarthasatya (\\"Absolute Reality\\"), Buddhajnana, which is beyond concepts, and described by terms as \\"truly existing.\\" This approach helps \\"to overcome certain residual subtle concepts,\\" and \\"the habit - fosterd on the earlier stages of the path - of negating whatever experience arises in his/her mind.\\" It destroys false concepts, as does prasangika, but it also alerts the practitioner \\"to the presence of a dynamic, positive Reality that is to be experienced once the conceptual mind is defeated.\\" Writings *Buddha Nature:The Mahayana Uttaratantra Shastra with Commentary by Jamgon Kongtrul and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, Snow Lion Publications (2000), *Maitreya's Distinguishing Phenomena and Pure Being, Commentary by Mipham and Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, translated by Jim Scott, Snow Lion Publications (2004) *Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness, by Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, translated and arranged by Shenpen Hookham, Zhyisil Chokyi Ghatsal Publications (2001) *Stars of Wisdom: Analytical Meditation, Songs of Yogic Joy, and Prayers of Aspiration by Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso, translated by Ari Goldfield and Rose Taylor, Forewords by the Seventeenth Karmapa and the Dalai Lama, Shambhala Publications (2010), *The Sun of Wisdom: Teachings on the Noble Nagarjuna's Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way by Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche, Shambhala Publications (2003), *The Moon of Wisdom: Chapter Six of Chandrakirti's Entering the Middle Way with commentary from the Eighth Karmapa Mikyo Dorje's Chariot of the Dagpo Kagyu Siddhas translated under the guidance of Khenpo Tsültrim Gyamtso Rinpoche by Ari Goldfield, Jules Levinson, Jim Scott & Birgit Scott, Snow Lion Publications (2005), Notes References Sources  External links *Khenpo Rinpoche's homepage *Profile of KTGR on Nitartha site Category:20th-century Lamas Category:21st-century Lamas Category:Tibetan Buddhists from Tibet Category:Rinpoches Category:Tibetan Buddhist yogis Category:Karma Kagyu Lamas Category:1934 births Category:Living people ","title":"Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche"},{"id":"2592777","text":"Autumn Affair is an Australian (black and white) television series made by and aired by Network Seven station ATN-7, and also shown in Melbourne on Nine Network station GTV-9. Television in Australia had only been broadcasting since 1956 and Seven was the first commercial station to make drama a priority. It premiered 24 October 1958 and continued until 1959. The series was the first ever Australian television soap opera. It was also the second regular Australian-produced dramatic television series of any kind, with previous locally produced drama consisting of religious series The House on the Corner, and one-off plays largely aired on ABC.

There was a quarter hour gap in the schedule and Mauger was keen to develop use of video tape for drama. It was decided to make a 15-minute show using skills developed by those involved in The House on the Corner.McPherson p 155-156 Originally conceived as Julia: An Early Autumn Affair, the title was later shortened to just Autumn Affair. Many of the actors and writers involved in the production had previously worked on radio soap opera, and were inexperienced with television acting. Episodes were fifteen minutes in duration, recorded as kinescopes in black and white, and were screened Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 8:45 AM. a part of the station's Today breakfast program.http://colsearch.nfsa.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=11;parentid=;query=autumn%20affair%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;rec=7;resCount=10 There were three main conditions for the production: *it had to be written, produced and acted by Australians *it had to stand on its own as entertainment and compare with American imports *it had to be sold to other stations at comparable rates to the American imports.McPherson p 156 The series went into production without a sponsor, as the station ATN7 wanted to gain experience in television drama production. The cast comprised just six regulars; the story focused on Julia (Muriel Steinbeck), a widow in a love triangle situation with two men. Filmink later wrote that \\"Steinbeck was... a natural choice to play the lead... She laughed, loved and suffered with jolly good decency – the quintessential Muriel Steinbeck part.\\" Ailsa McPherson, who worked on the show as script assistant, wrote \\"for performance quality Autumn Affair relied heavily on Muriel Steinbeck's professionalism and her photographic memory She had a prodigious capacity to remember lines and to be almost work perfect after reading them aloud only three or so times. It saved the episode on a good many occasions.\\"McPherson p 158 The series was well-received when originally broadcast. Richard Lane wrote every episode.

It is the highest point of the Back o'Skiddaw region, an area of wild and unfrequented moorland to the north of Skiddaw and Blencathra. Other tops in this region include High Pike, Carrock Fell and Great Calva. The fell's slopes are mostly smooth, gentle, and covered in grass, with a few deep ravines. It stands a long way from a road and requires a long walk across the moor top get to it; this, as well as the fact that it is hidden from the rest of the Lake District by the two aforementioned giants, make it one of the most unfrequented tops in the Lakes. When it is climbed it is most often from Mungrisdale or from the north via Great Sca Fell. The word Knott is of Cumbric origin, and means simply \\"hill\\". Topography Skiddaw and Blencathra are the best known of the Northern Fells, fronting the range as they loom above Keswick and the road to Penrith. Behind this wall is a further group of fells, commonly referred to as Back o' Skiddaw.Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Knott stands at the centre of this group, in addition to being the highest point. The Back o'Skiddaw group is separated from Blencathra and the Skiddaw massif by Skiddaw Forest. Confusingly this Forest contains no trees -- other than the windbreak of Skiddaw House -- but is a marshy upland area at around 1,300 ft surrounded on all sides by higher fells. Three major streams flow from Skiddaw Forest, dividing the Northern Fells into three sectors. Dash Beck runs north-west, the River Caldew north-east and the River Glenderaterra south, between Skiddaw and Blencathra. Knott itself is a long whale-backed ridge running for three miles in an east–west direction. With the exception of the extreme east and west, the fell has broad and gentle contours clad primarily in grass. Many of the streams draining it have cut deeply into Knott's flanks, exposing yellow and red soils which are visible in distant views. sketch map of Knott The western end of the fell is Burn Tod, which descends roughly between Burntod and Hause Gills, both tributaries of Dash Beck. To the north is a parallel but shorter shoulder, Frozen Fell, and these two spurs are the only part of the fell which drain westward to the River Derwent. From the south of the summit a ridge descends across a narrow col to the neighbouring fell of Great Calva. A further spur on this flank, across to the east, is named Snab. Wiley Gill and Burdell Gill fall on this side to the River Caldew and, ultimately, the Eden at Carlisle. The eastern terminus of the summit ridge is Coomb Height. At the base of the slope, amid rough ground, are the remains of Carrock Fell Mine. Coombe Height is bordered by Wet Swine Gill and Grainsgill Beck, further tributaries of the Caldew. Two connecting ridges run north from Knott, separated by the deep ravines of Roughton Gill. The western arms drops across an area of bog and with little reascent arrives at the summit of Great Sca Fell. The eastern branch crosses Miller Moss and then runs at high level for two miles to High Pike, first passing the subsidiary tops of Great Lingy Hill and Harestones. =Miller Moss= In August 2018 it was reported that Miller Moss, also known as Little Lingy Hill, had been re-surveyed and measured as with a prominence of , enabling it to be classed as a mountain and included in the list of Nuttalls. Summit Wainwright noted of the summit that \\"If the party consists of more than one person and if, further, a bat, ball and wickets can be found in the depths of somebody's rucksack, a cricket match can be played on turf many a county ground might covet.\\" Amidst the grass a cairn has been built. Further such markers adorn the tops of Coomb Height, Burn Tod and Snab, but the ridge top is otherwise featureless and the paths faint and intermittent. The view southward is constrained by Blencathra and Skiddaw, neither displaying their best side, but between the two is a narrow slice of central Lakeland. This includes a section of distant Thirlmere along with the Scafells. To the north are the Solway Firth and the hills of south west Scotland, but there is little interest to the foreground. Computer-generated summit panorama Mining Although the main part of Carrock Fell Mine is beneath Carrock Fell, there are some workings to the south of Grainsgill Beck at the base of Coomb Height. A trench runs northward down the slope to the beck, containing a number of shafts and levels. These surface workings follow the line of the Harding Vein, the most productive part of the mine. Carrock Fell Mine was the only British Tungsten mine outside Cornwall and was operated at various times between 1850 and 1982 when the price of Tungsten was sufficient. Although reserves of Wolframite and other tungsten ores are believed to remain, the Harding vein beneath Knott has long been worked out and the levels were used for dumping sludge from ore processing operations.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) A small operation on the southern flank of Knott was Little Wiley Gill Mine. A 40-yard level was driven here, but no other information survives. Ascents From Orthwaite to the north-west a track can be followed to the source of Hause Gill and the col between Knott and Great Calva. Alternatively a start can be made at Longlands, crossing the intervening ridge between Meal Fell and Great Cockup and then following a path up between Burn Tod and Frozen Fell. Fell Side provides access from the north, along the old mine track beside Roughten Gill. Once the mine is reached a pathless climb can be made to the summit. The access road to Carrock Fell Mine can be used to lead onto Coomb Height for an ascent from Mosedale. Wainwright gave dire warnings regarding the mine workings on this route.

History  Neste was established in 1948 as the state petrol company of Finland, to ensure the availability of refined fuels. This entailed the building of refineries and developing the necessary technology. The refineries were built using American technology, which the U.S. government was first reluctant to provide, because many American oil companies would be competitors. After lobbying by the contractor Lummus, they relented, mainly due to the threat of the contract being handed to the Soviet Union. In practice, much of the oil refined was of Soviet origin, although after the collapse of the Soviet Union, North Sea oil was used. Thanks to Neste, the oil crisis of 1973 had little effect in Finland.Öljyn pyörteissä – Nesteen tarina, MTV3.doc su 27.9.2015 klo 14.00. Franck Media. Retrieved on 9 July 2016. It held a legal import monopoly until the market liberalisation in the 1990s. The oil transport infrastructure in Finland was built and is owned by Neste, and thus petrol stations usually obtain fuels from Neste, although the monopoly is no longer government- sanctioned. In the 1970s, Neste introduced petrochemical and plastics production and natural gas to Finland. In 1994, Gasum was established with Gazprom as the minor (25%) shareholder. In 1994, polyolefin production was separated into Borealis, a joint venture with the Norwegian Statoil. In 1998, Neste's 50% stake in Borealis was sold to OMV and IPIC. In 1998, Neste Oyj merged with the power company Imatran Voima Oy to create Fortum Oyj. After the merger the chemical operations of Neste were transferred to the newly established company Neste Chemicals, which was sold to the investment firm Industri Kapital for $535 million. An engineering joint venture, Neste Jacobs Oy, was established with the American Jacobs Engineering in 2004. In 2017, Neste acquired Jacobs Engineering's 40% stake in Neste Jacobs and gained full control of the company. Correspondingly, Neste Jacobs was renamed Neste Engineering Solutions Oy. In 2005, Fortum demerged; the oil division of Fortum was transferred to the re-established Neste Oil. At this point, the Neste headquarters building (Raaden hammas) was kept by Fortum. The State of Finland maintains controlling interest (50.1%) in the company. The official name was Neste Oil after the Fortum demerger, but in 2015 it was changed back to Neste to emphasize the renewable energy business.Leppänen, Timo.

Operations Neste has conventional oil refineries, at Porvoo and Naantali in Finland, and two renewable diesel refineries, in Singapore and in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Two renewable diesel plants have also located at the Porvoo refinery. Together, these produce 0.525 million tons annually, which is approximately one fifth of the diesel consumption in Finland. Neste's production facility in Singapore is the largest renewable diesel refinery in the world, boasting a capacity of 1.1 million metric tonnes per annum. A planned new production line is expected to increase its capacity by one million tonnes by 2022. In addition to its own refineries, Neste has stakes in a base oil plant in Bahrain and in Nynas AB, which produces naphthenic oil and bitumen. Neste owns a chain of service stations, which is the largest chain in Finland. It has about 800 service stations in Finland, and about 240 stations in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Northwest Russia.

Neste Renewable Diesel is a hydrodeoxygenated (HDO) paraffinic fuel instead of a traditional transesterified biodiesel, and can be used in conventional diesel engines in any blending ratio without engine modifications. Neste Renewable Diesel can be produced from over ten different raw materials. In 2013, waste and residues accounted for over half of renewable raw material input, a fraction that increased to 80% in 2016. Renewable fuels have a good margin and contribute significantly to profits.http://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9250077 Neste and Stora Enso ran a joint venture to research production of renewable diesel oil from wood biomass with biomass gasification and the Fischer-Tropsch process in Varkaus, Finland. However, coming second in a bid for European Investment Bank startup funding led to cancellation of this project. The engineering division of Neste, Neste Engineering Solutions Oy, owns several important patents. A technology for MTBE is one. Another one is the NExOCTANE technology, which allows retrofitting MTBE plants to produce iso-octane; Neste licenses this to Halliburton.

Neste said they made that decision because Asian Agri is no longer obtaining raw materials from Tesso Nilo National Park and has started collaborating with WWF. Environmental groups have said that \\"more investigations would be needed to know if the Asian Agri Group mills are currently breaking the law, or not.\\" In 2018 Biofuelwatch stated in their report that Neste meets EU sustainability standards for biofuels by sourcing palm oil from older plantations, commonly ones for which rainforest was destroyed before 2008. However, investigations show that Neste cannot even guarantee that all its crude palm oil is free from more recent or ongoing deforestation.\\" Greenpeace has issued similar concerns about Neste's palm oil usage, after an investigation by MapHubs showing that Neste's supply chain for palm oil includes Indonesian palm mills with the most orangutan habitat loss. =Sponsorship= Neste is the title sponsor of the Finnish World Rally Championship rally, Neste Rally Finland.

Blair told the Washington Post, \\"My review was not affected at all by my association with EDO Corp., and the report was a good one.\\" He originally chose not to recuse himself because his link to EDO was not of sufficient \\"scale\\" to require it, but subsequently resigned from the EDO board to avoid any misperceptions. However, on Wednesday, December 20, 2006 the Washington Post reported that the US Department of Defense Inspector General's investigation into the affair found Blair had certainly violated the Conflict of Interest rules. The DoD report is available here: https://web.archive.org/web/20120415034305/http://www.dodig.mil/fo/Foia/ERR/Blairreport113006.pdf Criticism in the United States =2004 fine= In 2004 EDO Corporation was ordered to pay a fine of $2.5 million. This matter was related to activities of the former Condor Systems company, before EDO acquired assets of Condor Systems during their bankruptcy proceedings. Charges are laid out in a letter from the U.S. State Department to EDO President and CEO James Smith. Senior Vice President of Condor Systems, Fredric B. Bassett is EDO’s Senior Vice President-Finance, Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer. =The Earmarks affair= EDO Corporation has made payments from its Political Action Committee, to the political funds of both Republican and Democratic Party candidates, but these have tended to be to politicians who are on important government military defence and procurement committees. Controversy has arisen over contributions, to Senators Hillary Clinton, Charles Schumer and Congressman Steven Israel, who have then backed 'earmarked' government military contracts for EDO Corporation, soon afterwards. On December 27, 2005, the New York Sun reported that: > Many of the companies and executives who won earmarks this year donated > money not only to Senator Clinton, who sits on the Senate Armed Services > Committee, and to Mr. Schumer, but also to Mr. Israel. And several of those > designated for earmarks gave to members of the Joint Defense Appropriations > Conference Committee, which wrote the New York projects into the defense > spending bill.< On 20 September 2006, the New York Sun reported EDO had gained further government defense contacts after giving financial donations to Washington insiders.\\"Lobby Group Gains Earmarks Through Use of Insider Staff\\", New York Sun, September 20, 2006 =EDO President James M. Smith and the 2006 Executive Excess Report= On 30 August 2006, EDO Corporation Chairman, CEO, and President, James M. Smith, was named in a report produced by the Institute for Policy Studies and United for a Fair Economy, entitled 'Executive Excess'. Smith was reported as having received one of the highest percentage pay raises of any CEO in America, as a direct result of the 'War on Terror' since 2001. His total compensation in 2006 was $1.8 million per year, up from $893,200 in 2001.\\"Executive Excess 2006: Defense and Oil Executives Cash in on Conflict\\" , Institute for Policy Studies, August 30, 2006 In July 2006 Smith filed U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) data showing he had sacked 400 workers at a factory in California after his management team had failed to secure a lucrative contract for anti-IED devices. In September 2003 EDO was listed by Fortune magazine as number 10 in the top 100 fastest growing companies in the U.S.\\"100 Fastest-Growing Companies\\", CNN, September 1, 2003 EDO have failed to make the top 100 at all in recent years because of financial troubles. and are now owned by ITT Corporation. =EDO Director Dennis C. Blair and the EDO-IDA scandal= Admiral Dennis C. Blair. Dennis C. Blair was until 2006 a Director of EDO Corp. He has also been a U.S. military commander and the Associate Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for Military Support. He is on record as having knowledge of covert CIA operations within allied countries that were intended to influence political affairs for the benefit of US interests.Dennis C. Blair On 25 July 2006, The Washington Post published an article by Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist R. Jeffrey Smith and Renae Merlethat.\\"Leader of Panel that Endorsed Jet Program Has Ties to Contractor\\", The Washington Post, July 25, 2006 This detailed links between a think tank, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) that had been commissioned as an independent advisor to the Pentagon, and EDO Corporation. The article exposed serious issues arising out of Blair's joint positions as president of IDA and as a director of EDO Corp. The article was based on evidence gathered by a non-profit corruption watchdog, called the Project on Government Oversight (POGO) that had published a detailed report on the same day, entitled \\"Preying on The Taxpayer: The F22 Raptor.\\" This report details evidence of a conflict of interest between IDA and EDO Corporation. The POGO report describes how IDA had produced an independent study for the Pentagon, entitled F-22 A Multiyear Procurement Business Case Analysis, that advised the U.S. Congress that a multiyear procurement (MYP) of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor could result in a cost savings, which is one of six requirements for issuing a multiyear procurement contract. The report did note, however, that this estimated cost savings was less than for other historical MYPs.\\"\\"Statement of Christopher Bolkcom, specialist in national defense, Congressional Research Service, before the Senate Armed Services Committee Air Land Subcommittee Hearing on F-22 Multiyear Procurement\\", July 25, 2006 Congress then approved the MYP, through a legislative amendment, proposed by Senator Saxby Chambliss (GA), partly on the basis of the report's findings. The IDA report was the only one at the time that backed an F-22 program extension, in contrast with two other previous reports that had advised against it. A separate study by RAND, however, commissioned in the wake of the IDA-EDO scandal, also estimated a cost savings associated with an F-22 MYP contract, which was actually larger than the estimated cost savings that IDA reported. The Chambliss amendment extended the production life of the Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor by three years, overturning a previous decision to phase out the fighter plane because of safety and performance problems, as well as its huge expense. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Airland Subcommittee, on 25 July 2006, POGO's Danielle Brian said: We do not know if Admiral Blair recused himself, or in any way affected the outcome of the IDA report. I would submit, however, that there is an appearance of a conflict of interest -- given his substantial personal financial interest and his fiduciary responsibility to EDO—in the continued funding of the F-22A. This raises reasonable questions about the independence of IDA’s analysis. EDO is an important sub contractor on the F22 program, being the sole supplier for the F22 AMRAAM vertical ejection launcher. As a director who owned shares in the company, Dennis Blair arguably stood to gain from any decision by Congress to extend the F22 program. \\"Testimony of POGO's Danielle Brian before the Senate Armed Services Airland Subcommittee on the F-22A Multiyear Procurement Proposal\\" , Project on Government Oversight, July 25, 2006 On 27 July 2006, The Washington Post reported that Dennis Blair had revealed that he would resign from the board of EDO Corporation, 'as soon as possible,' because of the revelations.\\"Ret. Admiral to Resign From Board: Senators Questioned Blair's Dual Role in F-22 Studies\\", The Washington Post, July 27, 2006 Dennis Blair then submitted his letter of resignation on 31 July 2006. On 13 September 2006, The Washington Post reported that Dennis Blair had resigned his position as president of the Institute of Defense Analyses after its trustees had found that a conflict of interest had occurred. Blair was asked to give up his other paid positions with military contractors, but he refused and instead chose to give up his position of president of IDA.\\"Defense Institute Head Resigns: Seats on Contractors' Boards Seen as Conflict of Interest\\", The Washington Post, September 13, 2006 On 20 September 2006, Rolling Stone magazine published an article on the story entitled \\"Another Tale of Waste and Fraud Unpunished\\".\\"Your tax dollars at work: In Washington, another tale of waste and fraud unpunished\\", Rolling Stone magazine, September 19, 2006 On 28 September 2006, The New York Times reported that the F-22 multiyear contract had been approved by Congress despite opposition from Donald Rumsfeld, George W. Bush and the present and future chairmen of top U.S. Government military procurement committees. The New York Times suggested that the military industrial lobby that pushed the F-22 multiyear programme was more powerful than the elected officials who oversee government military spending including the President of the United States himself.\\"Air Force Jet Wins Battle in Congress\\", September 28, 2006 On 1 December 2006, The Washington Post reported that the U.S. Inspector General had found that although Blair had indeed violated IDA's conflict of interest policy by working for both EDO and IDA at the same time, his actions had not affected IDA's results on the F-22. It also found that Blair's involvement in the IDA F-22 MYP study was \\"minimal,\\" with no involvement in conducting the analysis or preparing or reviewing the report before it was finalized. Dennis C. Blair was replaced as an EDO director by General John A. Gordon (ret), who is closely linked to Blair. In 1996 Gordon replaced Blair as Associate Director for Military Affairs at the CIA, and in 2007 Blair and Gordon sit together on the council of SAFE, a corporate-military think tank tasked with finding solutions to the approaching energy crisis.SAFE , April 12, 2007 In January 2009 Blair became Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama making him the highest ranking intelligence official in the US Government. He resigned this position in May 2010. =EDO Director Leslie Kenne and the Joint Strike Fighter contract= Lieutenant General Leslie Kenne spent 32 years in the United States Air Force. In 1997 she was appointed Director of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) program, the U.S. Department of Defense's largest ever military acquisition program with a budget of $30 billion. Lockheed Martin is the prime JSF program contractor. Lockheed Martin awarded EDO a contract on January 9, 2002 for the design, development and manufacture of a suite of pneumatic weapon delivery systems for the JSF. Kenne resigned from the USAF in September 2003 and shortly afterwards joined the board of directors of EDO Corporation.Press Release - December 1, 2003 =EDO Director Paul Kern and allegations of war crimes at Abu Ghraib/EDO links with Titan Corporation= Paul Kern receiving the report on the Abu Ghraib scandal from Generals George Fay and Anthony Jones While still serving in the U.S. military General Paul Kern was appointed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to report on an internal investigation into the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. In August 2004 he presented the Fay Report largely absolving the military hierarchy of blame for the torture and sexual abuse.\\"Statement by General Paul Kern, commanding General, United States Army Material Command, before the Armed Services Committee\\", September 9, 2004 Kern blamed the torture in part on the civilian contractors working with military intelligence services in the prison. One of the companies involved was identified as Titan Corporation, a contractor that supplies technology and 'civilian interrogators' to military intelligence. (The company has close links to the US intelligence community. Former CIA director James Woolsey has served on its board of directors.) However Kern did not advise that Titan Corporation should be charged with any criminal offence. Kern had been picked by Rumsfeld to investigate the Military Intelligence operations at Abu Ghraib after an earlier report which had implicated them in the torture. This earlier report was called the Taguba Report and because of its controversial reference to 'systematic abuse' was kept secret until it was leaked to Seymour Hersh of The New Yorker. In June 2007 Hersh published an article on Taguba who was forced to resign after submitting the report to Rumsfeld. A few enlisted U.S. soldiers were eventually convicted, and imprisoned as a result of the investigations. Titan Corporation sacked one of their employees Adel Nakhla who had admitted holding down prisoners who were being tortured. Another Titan employee John Israel, a 'civilian interrogator/interpreter' identified by the Taguba Report as one of the four main people believed to have been responsible for the torture is suspected by some journalists including Robert Fisk of being an Israeli agent.\\"The Trail of Torture: The Things Bush Didn't Say in His Speech\\" , CounterPunch, May 26, 2004\\"Who is Behind the Abuse at Abu Ghraib?\\" , Truth Seeker, May 6, 2004 In April 2008 the Bush Administration were ordered to release a memo under the Freedom of Information Act that showed it had approved torture techniques in 2003 and given legal argument support for the use of torture techniques.Al Jazeera English - News - Us Declassifies 'Torture' Memo Kern retired shortly after the report came out and in January 2005 joined EDO Corporation as a director. Two of the other ten EDO Corporation directors who helped to elect him, James Roth and Robert M. Hanisee, were, and remain directors of Titan Corporation and as directors are open to charges of collusion and direct involvement in war crimes according to international law, but they have not been prosecuted by the United States legal system. Despite a lack of political will by the US Government to prosecute, Titan Corporation and CACI were nonetheless defendants in a civil action brought by victims of the torture in Abu Ghraib Prison.\\"Al-Rawi v. Titan Corporation\\", United States district court, 2004\\"Ibrahim, et al., v. Titan Corporation, et al.\\", United States district court, 2005 The U.S. Military Commissions Act of 2006 effectively brought an end to such legal actions in the US. In 2005, Titan Corp. admitted bribery charges after it paid $2 million into the re-election fund of the President of Benin, Mathieu Kérékou.\\"US company admits Benin bribery\\", BBC, March 2, 2005 Kern is also a member of the Cohen Group which has as its CEO yet another EDO Corp director, Robert S. Tyrer. Protest in the UK =Regular anti-war protests outside EDO (UK) factory= On 21 September 2006, protesters blockaded the EDO MBM factory in Brighton for several hours forcing the Managing Director Paul Hills to scale a security fence to enter the premises. He then used an angle grinder or wire cutters to cut a hole in the EDO's fence to let the employees in to work. The protesters left the scene without being arrested. On 16 September 2006, 100 protesters marched through Brighton to deliver a petition calling for the closure of EDO MBM to Brighton Town Hall. On 23 August 2006 two protesters climbed 40 feet onto the roof of EDO MBM Technology Ltd to unfurl a banner protesting the company's supply of weapons to Israel used in the Qana bombing in which 16 Lebanese children were killed. On 19 July 2006 protesters staged a 'Horrors of War' demonstration outside the Brighton factory recreating scenes of violence and mutilation that result from aerial bombardment.Shock tactics in weapons factory protest On the morning of 17 July 2006, three activists completely blockaded EDO's Brighton, United Kingdom subsidiary EDO MBM Technology Ltd in protest at EDO’s supply of weapons technology to the Israeli military being used to attack Gaza and in the then ongoing 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. These are just a few actions in an ongoing campaign of protest, civil disobedience and non-violent direct action against EDO in Brighton that began in 2004 and has come to be known as the Smash EDO campaign. There has been at least one demonstration a week outside the factory since 2004, and the number of protests against the EDO MBM since 2004 now numbers in the hundreds. =Smash EDO campaign= There have been numerous protests and direct actions since 2004 voicing the opinion that EDO MBM should close or convert its factory to civilian use. In January 2009, during the Gaza War, activists raided EDO's factory in Moulsecombe and destroyed equipment. In 2010, a jury found the activists, who invoked the lawful excuse defence, according to which it can be lawful to commit an offence to prevent a more serious crime, not guilty of conspiring to cause criminal damage to the factory. Jonathan Hoffman, vice-chair of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, claimed the judge had \\"behaved more like the defence counsel than the neutral officer of the court that he was supposed to be. The role of a judge – far from advancing his own political agenda – is to clarify points of law to the lay members of the jury...\\" =The Zero Retention Force Arming Unit= The Zero Retention Force Arming Unit (ZRFAU) is a military electro mechanical device. EDO MBM Technology Ltd are sole owners of the proprietary rights to one such unit and act as technical support and design authority for its ongoing use and installation. The units are used in U.S. Navy BRU-32, BRU-41, BRU-42, BRU-45, the US Air Force BRU-46 & BRU-47, the Royal Australian Air Force MAU-12, the European Tornado HMERU & LMERU bomb racks. The ZRFAU is also used in the Israeli Military Industries (IMI) VER-2 Bomb Rack, a bomb rack also owned by EDO MBM Technology Ltd, and currently advertised for sale by a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd in Israel,\\"Cyclone Aviation Acquisition of IMI Aircraft: System Division Broadens In-House Capabilities\\", Israeli Ministry of Defense for the Israeli air force F-16. Following investigations by campaigners into EDO MBM's links with Israel, and the submission of documents showing these links in court as part of a defence of Palestine Solidarity protesters, EDO MBM removed from their website a reference stating it was 'actively manufacturing' ZRFAUs, claiming this statement had been 'an error'. Directors of EDO(UK)Ltd, the parent company of EDO MBM admitted that a US subsidiary, Artisan Technologies, in New Jersey, did manufacture the component supplied to Israel. This subsidiary was owned by EDO UK from 2000 until it was sold in 2008. Despite the sale of the company officially manufacturing the ZRFAU, EDO MBM continue to be the sole point of contact for sales and technical support for the component from 2000 to the present day. In November 2009 the Information Tribunal looking at EDO MBM's export licence applications held by the Dept for Business (BIS) found \\"There was no dispute that the ERU151 and the ZRFAU are components which can be incorporated into VER-2 bomb racks for use with F-16 combat aircraft, that those aircraft are used by the Israeli air force, and that from 1998 EDO owned the right to manufacture the ERU151 and the ZRFAU.'\\" But \\"After examining the documents, it concluded the information did not confirm claims that EDO supplied Israel, and therefore the documents should remain confidential. It was then established that EDO MBM's involvement with the design, development, technical support and supply of the ZRFAU had been taking place without any apparent UK export controls, in an apparent breach of UK legislation. In June 2010 in the EDO Decommissioners Case a jury of twelve members of the UK public acquitted seven people of conspiracy to cause £180,000 criminal damage to the EDO MBM factory, on the grounds that their belief that EDO MBM had been supplying Israel with the ZRFAU at the time of Operation Cast Lead and by extension their belief that EDO MBM were complicit in war crimes carried out by Israel against the people of Gaza was a reasonable belief. It followed that it also reasonable to damage the factory to the tune of £180,000 in order to try and in some small way stop these Israeli war crimes and protect Palestinian property. Even Paul Hills, the Director of EDO MBM, had accepted during the trial that the activists belief was 'not unreasonable,' in light of all the documents that appeared to establish the fact, although as in previous sworn testimony over five years, he continued to deny any such involvement. =VER-2= VER- 2 means Vertical Ejector Rack (for) 2 (bombs), and is designed for the US produced F-16 and F-18. In the 1990s Lucas Western Corporation helped Israel Military Industries design a rack for Israeli F-16s. A Janes Defence Weekly (JDW) article, in June 1996, stated that \\"Israel’s F16s use VER-2 vertical ejection bomb racks made by Israeli Military Industries (IMI)\\" IMI later sold this prt of its business to Elbit. In 2005 the managing director of EDO MBM admitted that the company had acquired all the rights to the VER-2 from Lucas Western in 1998 and had since been 'jointly marketing it for a third party country'. He stated under oath that he had removed references to the VER-2 from the EDO MBM website, after protests began in Brighton in 2004, to avoid controversy [42] In May 2009 managing director Paul Hills told The Argus: \\"I would and have stood up in court and sworn under oath that we don’t supply to Israel, which is one of the things Smash EDO accuse us of.\\" =EDO MBM and UN Peace Messenger City Brighton and Hove= EDO MBM was originally targeted by protesters because it represents the most direct link between the Iraq War the Occupation of Palestine and the UK city of Brighton and Hove. The city council was the first in the country to be awarded United Nations Peace Messenger City status and yet it owns the land, Home Farm Business Park, on which EDO MBM's factory stands. EDO rent the property through a third party company, Europa Holdings Ltd, who hold a 125-year lease on the section of the park where EDO has its factory.\\"Principal Speaker Keith Taylor becomes UN Peace Messenger\\", Green Party, June 30, 2006\\"Peacemonger\\" , Rocks Magazine, May 12, 2006 Till early 2005 the same lease was held by Cheshire County Council. EDO MBM provided essential arming and release components for the Raytheon Paveway 'smart munitions' used extensively in the shock and awe bombing by US/UK forces at the outset of the Iraq war. This led to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians. EDO MBM have been awarded a contract to provide components for the next generation Paveway IV 'fire and forget' smart bomb for the UK RAF. As a result of the apparent contradiction of being a peace messenger city while being the landlord of an arms company, Brighton City Council in July 2005 came close to passing a motion of censure against EDO MBM.\\"Weapons firm faces censure\\" , The Argus, July 19, 2005 At the end of a full council meeting, in which debate on the motion was refused on grounds of time limits, the council eventually passed a watered down amendment to the motion that struck out all mention of the company and instead resolved to raise a UN peace flag above the town hall on one day each year .http://peace.brighton- hove.gov.uk/Intranet/CommitteeMgt.NSF/0/858D20C62F2C078D80256FC50037F4C9/$File/050721%20Mins.doc. In March 2007, shortly after a Green Party councillor had taken on the role of 'peace messenger' from a member of the ruling Labour Party group, Brighton council announced they were scrapping the peace messenger city status for financial reasons. =Injunction case: EDO MBM v Campaign to Smash EDO & others/EDO MBM v Axworthy & others= The ongoing protests led EDO MBM and its employees, in April 2005, to seek a permanent high court injunction against 14 named protesters and two protest groups Smash EDO and Bombs out Of Brighton, on grounds of harassment.\\"Iraq war firm asks for bar on protests\\", The Guardian, April 11, 2005 The intended injunction brought under Section 3 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, applied to all protesters, not only those named in the court papers (who in any case strongly denied the allegations). The case created controversy because it was seen by some as an unjustified measure used by a U.S. arms company to suppress the freedom to protest of UK anti-war protesters. Others, however, suggested that the court action was used in order to prevent harassment and violent crime. The company failed to gain a permanent injunction and dropped the action in early 2006, at a cost of several million dollars in legal costs. =Allegations of Sussex Police collusion with EDO MBM= In the course of the high court battle a temporary or interim injunction was imposed on all protesters until a full trial could deal with the full facts of the case. The restrictions on protests and the aggressive strategy of Sussex Police brought about by this injunction, led to dozens of arrests and public order criminal charges against protesters. Two protesters spent up to a week in Lewes prison (on remand) as a result of arrests for alleged breaches of the injunction. The first for using a video camera to gather evidence of an assault on a protester by a security guard, and the second for stepping into a road opposite the factory. These charges carried a penalty of up to five years in prison on conviction. The cases would have had Crown Court jury trials if not dropped by the CPS. Others were arrested after allegations that they had disobeyed police orders, assaulted police, or obstructed them in the enforcement of the injunction. After evidence came to light in the High Court that Sussex Police may have colluded with EDO Corporation to exaggerate the threat posed by demonstrators to the safety of employees, defence solicitors in related criminal cases began to investigate further. Then in what appeared to be a domino effect, the Crown Prosecution Service proceeded to drop all criminal charges, against all protesters, in all related cases, in an effort to protect the confidentiality of internal Sussex police documents which may have helped defendants prove such collusion had taken place.\\"Weapons demo case collapses\\" , The Argus, March 13, 2005 In July 2006 13 official complaints against Sussex Police were filed by protesters alleging police collusion with the arms company.\\"New battle over EDO bomb parts factory\\" , The Argus, July 10, 2006 EDO (UK) Chairman Sir Robert Walmsley questioned Sir Robert Walmsley is a director of EDO Corporation, and is Chairman of the Board of EDO (UK),\\"Board of Directors: Sir Robert Walmsley\\" , EDO Corporation, 2004 which includes EDO MBM Technology Ltd in Brighton. On 1 August 2004 The Independent reported that Sir Robert Walmsley, Former Chief of Procurement at the UK Ministry of Defence, who retired in April 2003, had been called in by a UK government watchdog, the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, to answer questions about his appointments to the board of Directors of General Dynamics and EDO Corporation.\\"Blair defies watchdog over jobs for the boys\\", The Independent, August 1, 2004 General Dynamics was awarded the (₤1.7 billion) Prime Contractor and Systems Integration contract for the BOWMAN secure, digital voice and data communications system in September 2001, while Walmsley was still in charge of MOD procurement. On retirement in April 2003 Warmsley was offered a lucrative directorship of General Dynamics. A government watchdog committee advised Walmsley not to take up the post for one year after he had retired from the MOD, to avoid the appearance of a 'reward' being given by General Dynamics to Walmsley. Walmsley publicly joined General Dynamics in April 2004. He had by then, already become a non-executive director on the board of British Energy. His position at General Dynamics was described as a 'triumph' by the Daily Mail on 23 February 2004 as his appointment gave him the 'highest position achieved by a Briton at a US prime contractor.' In The Independent report, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair was said to have dismissed the watchdog recommendations that tighter rules were needed over such issues. In a later report published by The Independent on 26 December 2004, Blair was alleged to have helped 'mandarins' such as Walmsley, gain top jobs in the private sector, in defiance of anti-corruption committees. In May 2006, The Independent reported UK Government plans to scrap anti-corruption watchdog committees.\\"Anti-sleaze watchdogs face axe in shake-up\\" , The Independent, October 14, 2006 =Sir Robert Walmsley and the Global Dominance Group= In 2006 Sir Robert Walmsley was named in a report 'The Global Dominance Group' produced by the US research group Project Censored. Walmsley is cited as one of 240 people considered as the world's top advocates of neo-conservative US global military domination. =Sir Robert Walmsley and the Al Yamamah arms scandal= Sir Robert Walmsley has also been linked to controversy over the Al Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia which was conducted in such secrecy that government National Audit Office reports into the deal remain classified. The deal has been associated with bribery and corruption allegations, and was the subject of a police investigation until dropped in controversial circumstances., Reuters, January 18, 2007 Police were denied access to an NAO report because it is classified. A Daily Telegraph report on 7 July 2006 reported, that judging from a list documents released under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), that there had been two classified NAO reports rather that just one as previously thought.\\"Second secret report on Saudi deal\\", The Daily Telegraph, July 7, 2006 The revelation came about through the title of one of the documents: \\"Letter from Sir Robert Walmsley, Chief of Defence Procurement to C&AG; [NAO head Sir John Bourn] responding to recommendations in draft audit findings - 30 March 1998\\" which apparently refers to a draft of a second secret NAO report.

It was shown in Ireland on TV3 and City Channel. It was also screened on BBC One in the United Kingdom and TV4 in New Zealand. Premise The series revolves around The Breakers building situated near Bondi Beach, and the lives of the people who work and live there. The building houses three businesses all run by the same family. Breaker's Modelling School is run by Paul Simmons, The Breaker, a local newspaper is run by Eve, Paul's ex-wife, and Kate's Cafe, run by Kate Markham, Eve's sister. During its short run the series dealt with some controversial story lines and was not afraid to confront contentious issues, such as homosexuality and teenage suicide. Scheduling Unusually, the program aired outside of prime- time; with each episode airing mid afternoon each weekday and then repeated late that night. Reaction It was Breakers' somewhat edgy reputation coupled with low ratings that eventually led to the series being cancelled. The show was purchased by the BBC amid a flurry of media coverage and outrage, with some describing the show an Australian version of EastEnders. The Sun newspaper did a special feature of the show, covering some of the risque and controversial storylines. However, when the show finally debuted viewers were disappointed with the bland and familiar storylines, and ratings very quickly fell. The show was then shunted around the schedule to try to find an audience. It eventually moved to BBC2 but with ratings continuing to fall the show finished its run on BBC Choice. After its run on the BBC it was shown on small digital channel NBS in the UK. Australian Senator Karen Synon considered the depiction of Lucy Hill, in a lesbian relationship to be \\"inappropriate\\" given the program's afternoon timeslot, and requested the Australian Broadcasting Authority investigate if the show had breached broadcasting guidelines. The ABA told The Daily Telegraph that the storyline was \\"normal\\" and the show's PG rating was appropriate for the timeslot.

Born in Curcuraci, Messina, Sicily, Celi appeared in nearly 100 films, specialising in international villains. Although a prominent actor in Italian cinema and famed for many roles, he is best remembered internationally for his portrayal of Emilio Largo in the 1965 James Bond film Thunderball. Celi later spoofed his Thunderball role in the film OK Connery (aka Operation Double 007) opposite Sean Connery's brother, Neil Connery. Life and career Celi became a film actor in post-war Italy. He left the Italian film industry when he emigrated to Brazil where he co-founded the Teatro Brasileiro de Comédia along with the Brazilian stage greats Paulo Autran and Tônia Carrero in São Paulop.xxviii Sheren, Paul The Portuguese and Brazilian Theatre Motley Books, 1974 He was successful as a stage actor in Argentina and Brazil. He directed three films in South America in the 1950s, including the Brazilian hit Tico-Tico no Fubá in 1952. Celi began a new popular career when he played the villain in Philippe de Broca's That Man from Rio, selected by de Broca on location in Rio de Janeiro. The popularity of the film led him to be cast as camp commandant Battaglia opposite Frank Sinatra and Trevor Howard's Allied POWs in the 1965 Second World War escape drama Von Ryan's Express. This led him to his most well known role as Largo in Thunderball. He is also known to international audiences as Ralph Valmont, one of the villains in the Mario Bava action thriller Danger: Diabolik and the celebrated Fernando Di Leo's poliziottesco film Hired to Kill (La mala ordina, 1972) as Don Vito Tressoldi. Celi appeared as a protagonist in some Italian comedies including Amici Miei and Brancaleone alle Crociate and did some television work, notably in mini- series Petrosino (1972), portraying the legendary Italian-American cop, and as the ruthless aristocrat, the Baron of Carini in another very popular mini- series, La Baronessa di Carini (1975). In addition to his native Italian, Celi was fluent in several languages, including English, Spanish, French, German and Portuguese. Despite his proficiency in English, his thick Sicilian accent meant that he was usually dubbed when he appeared in English language films; however, he was not dubbed in the 1981 BBC serial The Borgias, in which Celi played Rodrigo Borgia. Personal life and death Celi was married three times. He died of a heart attack in Siena in 1986. His daughter Alessandra Celi, is an actress.

The Shambhala Buddhist sangha considers Sakyong Mipham to be its head, and the second in a lineage of Sakyongs; with his father, Chögyam Trungpa, being the first. Since 2018, reports on misconduct and power abuse by the Sakyong and some Shambhala leadership have led to a reformation process. Sakyong Mipham's teaching has been suspended and he has resigned from the leadership of Shambhala. The international governing body called the Kalapa Council resigned and has been replaced by a Board of Directors. A number of initiatives have been established to address misconduct and misuse and abuse of power in the organisation. Distinguishing characteristics Shambhala Buddhism partly derives from the teachings of Shambhala, as originally proclaimed by Chögyam Trungpa, which state that \\"there is a natural source of radiance and brilliance in the world, which is the innate wakefulness of human beings. This is the basis, in myth and inspiration, of the Kingdom of Shambhala, an enlightened society of fearlessness, dignity and compassion.\\" Furthermore, \\"Shambhala vision applies to people of any faith, not just people who believe in Buddhism. The Shambhala vision does not distinguish a Buddhist from a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew, a Moslem, a Hindu. That's why we call it the Shambhala kingdom. A kingdom should have lots of spiritual disciplines in it.\\" =Shambhala and Shambhala Training= The Great Eastern Sun Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche At the 1976 Seminary in Land O'Lakes, Wisconsin,Midal 2001, pp. 233–247 Trungpa Rinpoche began giving teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as Shambhala Training,Midal 2001, p, 220 inspired by his vision (see terma) of the legendary Kingdom of Shambhala. Shambhalian practices focus on using mindfulness/awareness meditation as a means of connecting with one's basic sanity and using that insight as inspiration for one's encounter with the world. The Shambhala of Chögyam Trungpa is essentially a secular approach to meditation, with roots in Buddhism as well as in other traditions, but accessible to individuals of any, or no religion. The greater social vision of Shambhala is that it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. Trungpa's book Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. Shambhala Training is administered worldwide by Shambhala International. Shambhala Training is presented in a series of weekend programs, the first five of which are called \\"The Heart of Warriorship\\", and the subsequent seven \\"The Sacred Path\\". The Warrior Assembly is the fruition of the Shambhala Training Sacred Path program. During Warrior Assembly, students study the Shambhala terma text, The Golden Sun of the Great East, and receive the practices of the \\"stroke of ashé\\" (said to be a terma through TrungpaMidal, Fabrice. (2001). Chögyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision. , pp 220-232) and lungta. The Satdharma community, established by Trungpa's appointed regent and Dharma heir Ösel Tendzin (Thomas Rich), offers a comparable \\"Shambhala Education\\" course of training in Ojai, California. =Shambhala within Shambhala Buddhism= After the year 2000, with the merging of the secular teachings of Shambhala and the Buddhist teachings of Vajradhatu into Shambhala Buddhism, completion of Shambhala Vajrayana Seminary (which itself requires taking Buddhist refuge and bodhisattva vows, as well as Buddhist vajrayana samaya vows) became a condition for receiving the highest Shambhala teachings, such as those of Werma and the Scorpion Seal Retreat. In turn, Warrior Assembly became a prerequisite for attending the Vajrayana Seminary. The Rigden Abhisheka enters the student into the practice of the Werma Sadhana. It is open to graduates of Shambhala Vajrayana Seminary who have completed their Shambhala ngöndro and to students who have already received the Werma Sadhana and completed their Kagyü Ngöndro. =Shambhala Terma= Certain Shambhala practices derive from specific terma texts of Trungpa Rinpoche's such as Letter of the Black Ashe, Letter of the Golden Key that Fulfills Desire, Golden Sun of the Great East, and the Scorpion Seal of the Golden Sun, in long and short versions. Trungpa Rinpoche is believed by his students to have received these teachings directly from Gesar of Ling, an emanation of Padmasambhava, and the Rigden kings.Mukpo, p. 223 Their terma status was confirmed by the Nyingma master Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. The Shambhala dharma practices derived entirely or in part from these texts include those of werma, drala, Wind Horse (Tib. lungta), and meditations on four \\"dignities of Shambhala\\": tiger (Tib. tak), lion (Tib. seng), garuda (Tib. kyung) and dragon (Tib. druk). Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, a great 19th century Nyingma lama and the predecessor of Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, wrote about many of these practices and concepts as well. Some, such as the \\"stroke of Ashé\\", have no known precedents. =Zen influence= Trungpa Rinpoche was deeply influenced by his friend Shunryu Suzuki Roshi, a Japanese Zen master who was one of the first accomplished teachers to present dharma to Westerners. As a result of this influence, certain attributes of form in Shambhala Buddhism are derived from Zen, rather than Tibetan Buddhism. The shrine rooms in Shambhala Buddhism, reflecting the Zen aesthetic of Kanso (簡素) or simplicity, tend to be sparsely furnished and decorated, whereas traditional Tibetan Buddhist shrine rooms are elaborate, ornate, and colorful. As in Zen but unlike Tibetan Buddhist practice, meditators engage in group practice of shamatha-vipashyana. In addition, Shambhala Buddhists have adopted the practices of kyūdō, ikebana (kado), tea ceremony, oryoki, calligraphy, and other traditional Japanese arts as a means of extending the mind of calm- abiding and awareness to more active practices. =Elements of Bön, Taoism, and Confucianism= To a lesser extent, Trungpa Rinpoche incorporated other elements into Shambhala tradition that he thought would be beneficial to practitioners. From the Bön religion, the lhasang ceremony is performed; other elements of shamanism play a role. From Confucianism comes a framework of heaven, earth, and man for understanding the proper relationship between different elements of compositions of all kinds. From Taoism comes the use of feng shui and other incorporations. =Dorje Kasung= The Dorje Kasung is a group that was formed by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche to support the transmission of the Shambhala teachings by helping create an appropriate environment for them to be taught in. The Dorje Kasung accomplish this by providing a gentle and uplifted presence at teaching events, providing security services, providing driving and personal assistance to the teachers, and working with any issues of conflict or health that may arise in the community. The training and model of the Dorje Kasung is based on military forms, such as hierarchy, uniforms, and drills. The purpose of utilizing the military format is not to propagate war, but to take advantage of the discipline and energy of military forms to embody and communicate compassion. The practice of Dorje Kasungship is founded on the mahayana Buddhist principle of compassionate action, and inspired by the vajrayana Buddhist emphasis on working directly with the energy of neurosis and transforming it into wisdom. Thus, through engaging directly with military forms, they aspire to fulfill the vision expressed in their motto, \\"Victory Over War\\". =Maitri and Mudra= Maitri is a therapeutic program that works with different styles of neurosis using principles of the Five Buddha Families. Mudra practice, first explored by the Mudra Theater Group, is based on traditional Tibetan monastic dance training and the teachings on mahamudra. =Traditional Buddhist practices= Shambhala Buddhism holds various meditation techniques of traditional Tibetan Buddhist lineages, including shamatha/vipashyana, zazen, madhyamaka, mahamudra and Dzogchen, tonglen, Lojong, traditional yidam practices such as Vajrayogini, Chakrasamvara, Vajrakilaya, Jambhala, Gesar, Tara, Manjushri, and Vajrasattva. History The term \\"Shambhala Buddhism\\", as used to describe the lineage and community led by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche, came into use around 2000. * In 1970, the Shambhala community had its origins with the arrival of the 11th Trungpa tülku, Trungpa Rinpoche, in North America. The first established center of his teachings was \\"Tail of the Tiger\\" in Barnet, Vermont (now Karmê Chöling). * In 1971, a second branch of the community began to form when Rinpoche began teaching at the University of Colorado. The Rocky Mountain Dharma Center was established, now known as Shambhala Mountain Center, near Fort Collins, Colorado. In the early 1970s the community grew rapidly and attracted the involvement of such notables as Allen Ginsberg, Anne Waldman, and many others * In 1973, the Shambhala community was incorporated in Colorado as Vajradhatu. Vajradhatu hosted visits by the Sixteenth Karmapa (head of the Kagyu School) in 1974, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche (head of the Nyingma School) in 1976, and the Fourteenth Dalai Lama in 1981. * In 1974, Naropa Institute was founded, a contemplative studies and liberal arts college, now fully accredited as Naropa University. * In 1975, Shambhala Lodge was founded, a group of students dedicated to fostering enlightened society. * In 1975, at an October party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary, Trungpa Rinpoche ordered his Vajra guard (i.e., the Dorje Kasung) to forcibly break into the room of his guest, Dana Naone, who he then ordered to be brought before the crowd and stripped naked, with onlookers ignoring her pleas for help and for someone to call the police.Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25 * In 1976, Trungpa Rinpoche began his cycle of Shambhala teachings and, with his students, manifesting forms of Shambhala society. Kalapa Court was established in Boulder, Colorado, as Trungpa Rinpoche's residence and a cultural center for the Vajradhatu community. Thomas F. Rich was empowered as Vajra Regent Ösel Tendzin and lineage holder in the Karma Kagyü and Nyingma lineages. * In 1977, Shambhala Training was founded to promote a secular approach to meditation practice and an appreciation of basic human goodness. The Gyalwa Karmapa, the head of the Kagyü lineage, confirmed the Vajra Regent's appointment as a lineage holder. Ösel Tendzin was the first Western student to hold such a position in the Kagyü lineage.Tendzin Shambhala Bio * In 1978, Trungpa Rinpoche conducted the first annual Kalapa Assembly, an intensive training program for advanced Shambhala teachings and practices. * In 1979, Trungpa Rinpoche empowered his eldest son, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo, as his successor and heir to the Shambhala lineage. * In 1986, Trungpa moved the international headquarters of Vajradhatu to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he died the following year. A large number of his disciples emigrated from the United States to Nova Scotia along with him. * In 1987, after Trungpa's death, Tendzin's role as spiritual head of Vajradhatu lasted until around 1989. Citing an AIDS-related infection, allegations arose that Tendzin had passed HIV to a male partner in the Colorado congregation, who in turn unknowingly infected his female partner. Tendzin, who was HIV-positive, knowingly had sex with students for three years without disclosing his infection. He had a delusion that his enlightened status protected himself and others from AIDS. It eventually came out that the Vajradhatu board of directors had known of the problem for more than two years and had done nothing about it.Coleman, James William. The New Buddhism: The Western Transformation of an Ancient Tradition (2001) Oxford University Press. Page 170. * After the death of Ösel Tendzin in 1990, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo became spiritual head of what would become Shambhala International. * In 1995, Ösel Rangdröl Mukpo was recognized by Penor Rinpoche as the reincarnation of Ju Mipham and enthroned as Sakyong. The Sakyong—literally \\"earth-protector\\"—is a chögyal—\\"dharma king\\"—who holds and propagates the teachings of Shambhala.Sakyong Shambhala Bio https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004539/http://www.mipham.com/biography.html * In 2000, at the Kalapa Assembly,Kalapa Assembly 2000 Collaborations Sakyong Mipham made a proclamationMipham Rinpoche, Sakyong. (2000) \\"Shambhala Buddhism\\". Published letter that started the process of enclosing the previously secular teachings of Shambhala within the container of a new buddhist lineage, Shambhala Buddhism. * In 2001, on a visit to Tibet, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche met the 12th Trungpa tülku, Choseng Trungpa Rinpoche, an incarnation discovered by Tai Situ Rinpoche in 1991. * In August 2007, The Sakyong married Khandro Tseyang Palmo with a ceremony conducted by Drupwang Penor Rinpoche during the Kalapa Festival in Halifax. Khandro Tseyang Palmo is currently the Sakyong Wangmo, a title held previously by Lady Diana Mukpo, now the Druk Sakyong Wangmo. * Since 2018 the international Shambhala community is going through a process of change triggered by reports on sexual misconduct by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche and power abuse by a number of Shambhala spiritual leaders. http://andreamwinn.com/project_sunshine/Buddhist_Project_Sunshine_Phase_2_Final_Report.pdf * In July 2018, Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche stepped back from leadership after the release of a third-party investigative report allegedly documenting sexual misconduct involving his students.https://www.buddhistdoor.net/news/sakyong- mipham-rinpoche-steps-down-from-shambhala-leadership-amid-probe-into-conduct * The international governing body, the so-called the Kalapa Council, resigned and has been replaced by a Board of Directors. * A number of initiatives have been established to address misconduct and misuse and abuse of power in the organisation. * While still being in retreat Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche resumed teaching to a small group of selected students in March 2020. The community today Shambhala Center, Boulder, Colorado Today, there are over two hundred Shambhala Meditation Centers, Groups and Residential Retreat Centers around the world, mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe and South America,Diversity Resources Diversity in Shambhala the largest communities being Halifax, Nova Scotia; Boulder, Colorado; northern Vermont; and New York City. =Shambhala-inspired schools= *Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado *The Shambhala School in Halifax, Nova Scotia * Alaya Preschool in Boulder, Colorado =Shambhala International= The umbrella organization that encompasses many of the distinct institutions of Shambhala Buddhism is called Shambhala International.

Satchels were carried by Roman soldiers as a part of their sarcina or luggage. No loculus has survived in entirety although some small portions of leather found at Bar Hill (Strathclyde, Scotland) have tentatively been identified as parts of a loculus. The object is primarily known from illustrations on Trajan's Column. The loculus is thought to have measured about and was likely made from leather. It is the right size to be made in one piece from a single goat hide although calf leather is also possible. The bag is reinforced by diagonal straps. In the centre of the front of the bag these straps held a bronze ring with a mushroom-shaped stud that holds the triangular flap closed. At the top corners were two plain bronze rings used to suspend the bag while it is carried on a shoulder pole or furca. The loculus was probably used to store rations and a soldier's personal effects. Reconstruction There have been many attempts to reconstruct the loculus for historical reenactment.

Since 2006, HPAC has been located just north of Hyde Park Boulevard, at 5020 S.Cornell Avenue, in the Kenwood neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. History =Beginnings= The Hyde Park Art Center, established in June, 1939, was originally called the Fifth Ward Art Center of Chicago, Illinois. In 1940, the name was changed to the Hyde Park Art Center. Its founders, who included future Senator Paul Douglas, consisted primarily of artists and volunteers committed to creating a neighborhood space for the visual arts. The Art Center's first home was a defunct saloon next door to then-alderman Douglas’ constituent office at 1466 E. 57th Street. =Post WWII= During and after World War II, HPAC was housed in a variety of locations, including a dance studio and an apartment building. It was forced to move often because of rent increases and gentrification, but continued to remain in the Hyde Park neighborhood. In the early 1950s, Don Baum took charge of the Art Center's curatorial and educational departments. He was a gifted teacher and mentor to many artists who took classes with him at the art center. Famously, Baum cultivated the Art Center as an incubator and primary exhibition space for the Chicago Imagists, curating three of their seminal exhibitions, all entitled Hairy Who?, in 1966, 1967, and 1968. In 1962, Ruth Horwich, an avid supporter of Chicago artists, joins the Art Center Board. Wilson, Karen. [Perpetually Strange: The Hyde Park Art Center], The Hyde Park Art Center, 2006, p.18 =2006 to Present= Exterior view of The Jackman Goldwasser Catwalk Gallery The Hyde Park Art Center moved into its brand new facility on April 22, 2006. A ribbon cutting ceremony for the new space took place that day, attended by Mayor Richard Daley, and several local aldermen, followed by the grand opening gala that evening. The next weekend, the Art Center hosted an official public opening in the form of a 36-hour celebration called \\"Creative Move.\\" Located just a few blocks away from its former space in the Del Prado Apartments, the new building at 5020 S. Cornell Avenue is a space that more than tripled the Art Center's capacities, with more exhibition galleries and classroom spaces. The new building includes a by projection facade on the front of the building, a digital classroom, an Istria cafe, and 4833 rph, a resource space and gathering place for community members and creative individuals. The Hyde Park Art Center celebrated its one-year anniversary in its new space with Creative Move Too, a 24-hour event in the space which once again brought in performers and organizations from around the city of Chicago, including the Jesse White Tumblers, Chicago Djembe Drumming Group, Blue Lotus Tribe Belly Dancers, and the McCormick Storybus. It also featured performances inside the Speaker Project, a performative sound installation by Juan Angel Chavez. =The Many Homes of the Hyde Park Art Center, 1939–Present= 1939–1942: 1466 E. 57th Street 1942–1946: 1507 Cable Court 1946–1948: 5645 S.

Architecture The Hyde Park Art Center's current building was designed by internationally recognized Chicago architect Douglas Garofalo of Garofalo Architects. The new building was converted from an old Army warehouse leased indefinitely to HPAC by the University of Chicago for $1 a year. The total budget for the project was $3 million.Thomas Mullaney, \\"Creative Visions, but for Many Millions Less,\\" New York Times, March 12, 2008, Arts section. Garofalo \\"was selected to design a building that would highlight accessibility between artists and the public, transparency of the process of art making and exhibiting, and encourage experimentation with technology and concepts.\\"Allison Peters, Takeover (Chicago: Hyde Park Art Center, 2006), 4. Two of the building's most notable architectural features function to both problematize and undermine the institutionalized boundaries, both tangible and intangible, that often exists between art organizations and the public: the first floor of the building includes \\"five metal garage-style doors that open up to the main gallery from the sidewalk,\\" thus extending the gallery space into the street and allowing the public to enter the Art Center easily and at will; and the second floor features \\"a 10x80 foot glass facade ... outfitted with a system of high range projectors, computers, scrims and screens used primarily to show large-scale digital artworks,\\" that can be viewed from both inside and outside the Art Center. Exhibitions The Hyde Park Art Center primarily exhibits work by emerging or under-recognized contemporary artists living in Chicago. The Art Center does not maintain a permanent collection. The Art Center exhibited Leon Golub, Ed Paschke, Roger Brown, Ruth Duckworth, Juan Angel Chávez, Kerry James Marshall and Dawoud Bey early in their careers. Programs Established in 1939, the Center's mission has been to stimulate and sustain the vitality of the visual arts in Chicago. To fulfill this mission, the Center cultivates arts mentorships within the community it serves, fostering a collective spirit among artists, teachers and students, children and families, collectors, and the general public. As one of the oldest alternative spaces in the city, HPAC has a long record of exhibiting a wide range of work by emerging artists. Panel discussions, gallery talks, poetry readings, music performances, open house events, and a series of short pieces by guest writers expand upon the approaches and ideas presented in each exhibition and engage a broad audience. In addition, the Art Center utilizes its exhibitions program to engage and teach school groups about contemporary art practices. =Education= The Hyde Park Art Center's educational programs serve both South Side neighborhoods and the Chicago area. Begun in 1940, HPAC's Oakman Clinton School and Studio Program has educated thousands of children and adults in ceramics, sculpture, painting, drawing, photography, stained glass, and other visual art practices in classes taught by professional artists. =Community Outreach= Participants at HPAC's monthly event Cocktails & Clay The Hyde Park Art Center continually hosts a variety of events designed to introduce and engage different audiences in both the Art Center's current exhibitions and the larger world of contemporary art. Some of the Art Center's monthly events include: * TalkingPoint - An informal discussion group for artists and the general public. * Cocktails & Clay - Held on the second Friday, Cocktails & Clay seeks to introduce people to ceramics, their neighbors and the Art Center in a relaxed atmosphere that includes live DJs and a cash bar. * Art Thing - An informal chat with a currently exhibiting artist held on the first Tuesday of every month. * Second Sundays - A day of family-oriented art activities and performances held on the Second Sunday of every month. Creative Move Since the inauguration of its new building in 2006, the Hyde Park Art Center has hosted Creative Move, an annual 24-hour- long celebration of the visual and performing arts each April. This event, which is free and open to the public, attracts hundreds of people from Chicago and the surrounding suburbs. During Creative Move, the Art Center stays open for the entire night. The event typically begins on a Friday night and ends the following Saturday night. * Creative Move (2006) took place over a 36-hour period from 9am Saturday, April 29, 2006 until 9pm Sunday, April 30, 2006. It featured the new building's inaugural exhibition, Takeover. * Creative Move TOO (2007) took place from noon on Saturday, April 28, 2007 to noon on Sunday, April 29, 2007. It featured Juan Angel Chavez's Speaker Project. * Creative Move: Moving Mountains (2008) took place from 8pm on Friday, April 25, 2008 until 8pm on Saturday, April 26, 2008. It featured the opening of Kelly Kaczynski's Olympus Manger,' Scene II and the on-site installation of Rebecca Keller's Victory Garden for a New Millennium.

Together with Hohensaaten-Friedrichsthaler Wasserstraße, the Oderhaltung and the Schwedter Querfahrt it forms the Havel-Oder-Wasserstraße. It runs from the town of Cedynia near the city of Szczecin on the Oder River between Germany and Poland to the Havel, a tributary of the Elbe, near Berlin. It is long, and wide. In 1934 a ship lift was built on the canal, near Niederfinow. It vertical lift was . The dimensions of the caisson are 85 x 12 x 2.5 m. It could lift vessels of up to 1000 tonnes displacement. History The assumed start of the actual Oder-Havel Canal is the current mouth of the Oranienburger Havel. It leads through the Lehnitzsee, which previously did not belong to the Havel, and reaches the Lehnitzschleuse. Most of the canal follows the former Malz Canal and then replaces the older Finow Canal up to its eastern end.

History Tracing its antecedents to Hackfeld's Dry Goods formed by German trader Heinrich Hackfeld in 1849, in 1852 the retail location was renamed for Hackfeld's nephew, B. F. Ehlers. Hackfeld continued to maintain an interest in the store, while he concentrated on his trading, shipping and real-estate interests. In 1881, Paul Isenberg (1837–1903) became half partner in the business. In 1898 the Hackfeld and Isenberg family interests in Hawaii were officially reorganized as H. Hackfeld & Co. In 1918 at the height of World War I, H. Hackfeld & Co. was seized by the American government as alien property (since many of the Hackfeld and Isenberg heirs still lived in Germany), and was sold to a newly formed consortium, American Factors. At the same time the B.F. Ehlers store was renamed The Liberty House in response to anti-German sentiment. With Hackfeld's huge sugarcane plantations and land interests, American Factors (later known as Amfac) became one of Hawaii's Big Five landowners. In 1969 Liberty House expanded onto the mainland with Amfac's purchase of the Rhodes Western department stores, a long-time consolidator of department stores. The former Rhodes' stores were renamed Liberty House between 1971 and 1974. The mainland operation eventually included stores in Arizona, California, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, New Mexico and Washington. This expansion culminated with the construction of a new San Francisco flagship store in 1974 at Stockton and O'Farrell streets. Poor results and a scattered footprint caused the rethinking of future investment, and in 1978 Liberty House began winding down the mainland stores, with the remaining ten being sold in 1984. In 1988 Amfac was acquired in a leveraged-buyout by JMB Realty Corp., a Chicago real estate investment company, under whose ownership Liberty House expanded to Micronesia Mall in Guam in 1994. In 1998 Liberty House filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, under which it closed most of its resort store business, which had totaled over 40 stores at one point. In 2001, after emerging from bankruptcy, the company was acquired by Federated Department Stores and merged into Macy's West. Macy's currently maintains a common law trademark by using the LibertyHouse.com domain which forwards to the Macy's website.

Life and career Rugolo was born in San Piero Patti, Sicily. His family emigrated to the United States in 1920 and settled in Santa Rosa, California. He began his career in music playing the baritone horn, like his father, but he quickly branched out into other instruments, notably the French horn and the piano. He received a bachelor's degree from San Francisco State College and then went on to study composition with Darius Milhaud at Mills College in Oakland, California and earn his master's degree. After he graduated, he was hired as an arranger and composer by guitarist and bandleader Johnny Richards. He spent World War II playing with altoist Paul Desmond in an Army band. After the war, Rugolo worked for Stan Kenton. He and songwriter Joe Greene collaborated on songs that made Kenton's band one of America's most popular. While Rugolo continued to work occasionally with Kenton in the 1950s, he spent more time creating arrangements for pop and jazz vocalists, most extensively with former Kenton singer June Christy on such albums as Something Cool, The Misty Miss Christy, Fair and Warmer!, Gone for the Day, and The Song Is June! During this period, he worked on film musicals at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and in the late 1950s he served as an A&R; director for Mercury Records. Among his albums were Adventures in Rhythm, Introducing Pete Rugolo, Rugolomania, An Adventure in Sound: Reeds in Hi-Fi, and Music for Hi-Fi Bugs. Rugolo's arrangements for the album The Four Freshmen and Five Trombones propelled the group to recognition in jazz circles. It was their bestselling album. Television and film scoring In the 1960s and 1970s, Rugolo did a great deal of work in television, contributing music to a number of series including Leave It to Beaver, Thriller, The Investigators, The Thin Man, Checkmate, The Fugitive, Run for Your Life, Felony Squad, The Bold Ones: The Lawyers, Alias Smith and Jones and Family. He provided scores for a number of TV movies and a few theatrical films, such as Jack the Ripper (1959), The Sweet Ride (1968), Underground Aces (1981) and Chu Chu and the Philly Flash (1981). In 1962 he released an album of themes from popular television series, TV's Top Themes, which included his composition for the 1961 CBS sitcom Ichabod and Me. Rugolo's small combo jazz music featured in a couple of numbers in the popular movie Where the Boys Are (1960) under the guise of Frank Gorshin's \\"Dialectic Jazz Band\\". Death Rugolo died at the age of 95 on October 16, 2011 in Sherman Oaks, California.

Synopsis Seth (Stewart), a sitcom writer-producer, meets Chelsea (Wilson), an interior decorator, at his best friend Larry's (Bellamy) wedding. He's immediately sexually attracted to her while she's instantly attracted to his single-ness. They both ditch their wedding dates and start their own date that same night. Chelsea tells Seth that she has only one rule: she won't have sex with a guy until they have had at least three meals together. Seth proceeds to speed date through the evening ensuring that they actually eat three meals. Chelsea agrees to sleep with him, but only if he agrees then and there to an exclusive relationship. Seth is alarmed, but agrees and they end up having wild sex in the showroom of Chelsea’s job. The two become a couple, and seem fairly happy but Seth increasingly realizes that Chelsea is quick to anger and an expert manipulator. She tells him she loves him after only four weeks together and when Seth doesn't immediately reciprocate, Chelsea nearly storms out before, in a panic, Seth tells her he loves her. She claims her cat has gone missing and uses this as an excuse to move in to Seth's place. The cat turns up fine just a few days later. During a Valentine's Day getaway, Seth gives Chelsea jewelry as a romantic gift and she tells him she thought he was going to propose. He insists it's far too early for him to consider marrying Chelsea, and when she disagrees they strike a deal to get engaged in one year if things feel right between them. Over the next year, Seth and Chelsea fight frequently and reconcile with make-up sex. On Valentine's Day, Chelsea is clearly expecting a proposal and is apoplectic when Seth presents her with expensive diamond earrings instead, noting that they'd had a rocky year and proposing still doesn't feel right. She shouts and curses at him, ending their relationship, then throws the earrings into the ocean. Seth briefly feels relieved that things are over, but Chelsea quickly files a palimony lawsuit and moves back into his house as part of an effort to claim half of what he owns. She proceeds to torture him by filling the house with rescue cats, knowing he's allergic, and puts hair removal cream in his shampoo, which causes Seth's hair to fall out, forcing him to wear a wig. Seth retaliates by farting excessively in bed and kidnapping Chelsea's cat, then tricking Chelsea to jump into filthy water by pretending to throw the cat over the edge of a pier. The two briefly come to an agreement without their lawyers, christened with hate sex, but Chelsea is convinced by her lawyer to renege and files a restraining order against Seth to force him out of the house. Seth goes to stay with Larry, but when Chelsea turns up to visit Larry's wife, Holly (Banks), the ensuing argument leads to Holly kicking both men out. Pushed to his breaking point, Seth kidnaps Chelsea and takes her to a planetarium, where she assumes he's going to murder her. However, he proposes to her with the ring she had previously asked for and Chelsea accepts. He gets the ring appraised, sells his house so they can start anew in another home and convinces Chelsea to get married in Las Vegas, since their families think they're insane to be getting married after everything that's happened, and renew their vows later on in a big ceremony. Larry attempts to convince Seth to call it off, but he refuses and the wedding goes on in Las Vegas. However, when Seth is supposed to say, \\"I do,\\" he instead says, \\"I don't think so,\\" and has a security guard stay between him and Chelsea. He reveals that the proposal and wedding were a ploy to get her to drop her lawsuit, noting that she'd also now moved out of his home. Seth's dentist and his assistant had posed as a married couple and purchased the house, which they will sell back to him, and he had paid a jeweler to appraise Chelsea's engagement ring, which is a fake. Seth triumphantly dances down the aisle, and Chelsea furiously grabs the guard's gun and shoots him in his backside. Police arrest Chelsea and an ambulance takes Seth away, who loudly declares that he's now \\"full-on Liberace\\" gay after his time with Chelsea. As the ambulance drives away, Seth recants his coming out and Chelsea rants to the arresting officer, who replies, \\"Don't make me gag you, ma'am.\\" Cast * French Stewart as Seth Winnick * Bridgette Wilson as Chelsea Turner * Bill Bellamy as Larry Garnett * Tyra Banks as Holly Garnett * Steve Hytner as Marty Mark * Jason Bateman as Jesse Travis * Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as Rebecca Melini Reception =Critical reception= Upon its release, Love Stinks received negative reviews from critics.

Arts towns generate a good portion of their economy, their existence, and their tourism from establishing a culture of the arts. By definition, a disproportionately large number of the citizens in these towns are involved in the arts. Santa Fe, in New Mexico, is an example of an arts city in the United States, with over 5,000 artists living within city limits, year round arts events, art institutions including 10 museums and 100 galleries, as well as classes, educational seminars, and conferences. Further towns of art, as the Europeans designate them, include such internationally famous cities such as Florence, in Tuscany, Italy, the heritage home of renaissance art and of Michelangelo and Leonardo. The term similarly is used for centers for arts festivals like Tanglewood or such small towns as Nelsonville, Ohio, that have dedicated themselves to an artistic identity based on traditional ceramics and folk-art centered on an arts oriented town square. History Going back several millennia, in the progression of civic history, emerging towns or cities have taken different cultural courses. Certain towns or cities have deliberately attempted to put forward a presence in which culture ranged high above other achievements in military strength, or in manufacturing, or in strategic importance. Perhaps the best example is Athens in Greece as the first widely known arts town, acting in opposition to Sparta a quintessential examplar of anti-cultural town development in that Spartan citizens were forbidden non-military pursuits and occupations. Athens has since provided the inspiration for countless imitations in civic development. Hellenism and Hellenistic ideas have driven countless cities to imitate this city driven by arts, populated by artists, and artisans, and with a strong local, regional, and international influence on arts. Alexandria, Constantinople, and many medieval Italian city-states saw Athens as their cultural ideal, and built complex civilisations on reviving Athenian values. With the onset of industrialism in Victorian times, a small revival of arts towns was influenced by William Morris in the UK; and by arts idealists such as Thoreau and Walt Whitman in America, and brought into fulfillment by architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright whose influence on supporting the artisan class, their folkish arts, and their use of natural local materials, led to rural revivals of arts towns since the 1970s. Key elements of arts towns Arts towns have at least ten primary clusters that define them. These include an area of arts density considered the centre of the town which would contain multiple: art galleries that also host art walks; crafts workshops that use local materials; theaters and theater group facilities, folk-arts training and exhibition facilities; cafes with locally produced art items; at least three to five arts cooperatives; historical buildings that have undergone proper renovation and kept their character with historical interpretation; at least two or three arts foundations offices; an arts council that works with town planners and the city council; and daily classes in the arts that involve many of the townsfolk, and draw students and tourists for seminars. Most typically, these towns also have a ratio of one museum per 2000 citizens. Recognition by surveys of the towns having an artistic tourist draw is also important. In some countries arts towns are given an official designation by national cultural authorities. Contemporary arts towns in the United States Globally, tourists recognize at least twenty cities, towns, or villages as arts towns. In America there are at least 100 towns that are regularly cited, in Canada 10. Such a list would include towns famous for theatrical events (Stratford, Niagara on the Lake), musical events (Tanglewood, Woodstock), high concentrations of artisans working in one artistic area (Nelsonville, Ohio; Northport, Alabama; Portland, Maine; Oxford, Mississippi; Brattleboro, Vermont); or which host large numbers of artists, actors, or writers (Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, Northampton, Provincetown, in Massachusetts). Certain university towns that are in rural areas, through sheer number of cultural events, as well have achieved world reputations as arts towns (Ithaca, NY; Chapel Hill, NC; Taos, New Mexico; Yellow Springs, Ohio; and Jackson, Wyoming). Contemporary arts towns in Canada The most recognized arts towns in Canada are: Stratford, Ontario, home of the Stratford Festival of Canada and a large Shakespearean theatrical community; and Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, home of the Shaw Festival, preserving the work of George Bernard Shaw and other Edwardian playwrights, such as Galsworthy, restored 18th and 19th century buildings with historical interpretation; and classes in costume and drama, academic conferences, and year-round arts initiatives, all in a town with five museums and a population under 14,000. In Banff, the Banff Centre for the Arts is the key element that allows in a very small town, the capacity for a short film festival with an emphasis on animation; arts and crafts festivals, facilities for a large number of artisans who have rejuvenated a formerly isolated rural community into a global arts centre. And to which artists who live in subsidized nearby retreats for month-long residencies create new works in music, theatre, literary translations, and multi-media by providing synergy within an artistic community. Historic arts towns in Europe The EEC has developed designations of \\"cities of the arts\\" for towns and smaller cities having historic and artistic importance based on UNESCO studies for over twenty years as part of the sustainable cities initiative.

Mstyora miniatures appeared in the settlement of Mstyora (in modern Vladimir Oblast) in the early 20th century on the basis of a local tradition of icon-painting. In 1923, Mstyora painters formed an artel called Ancient Russian Folk Painting (Древнерусская народная живопись), renamed Proletarian Art (Пролетарское искусство) in 1931. This artel was turned into a factory in 1960. The Mstyora painting technology was borrowed from the Palekh artists. Mstyora miniatures usually represent characters from real life, folklore, and literary and historical works.

The region stretching from the north of Ain Ebel to south near Yaroun is rich in flint instruments, and the whole surrounding region as far as Jish contains megalithic ruins, perhaps pre-Canaanites.Hulot & Rabot, \\"Actes de la societé géographie,\\" Seance du 6 décembre 1907, La Géographie, Volume 17, Paris, 1908, page 78 =Ancient History= In the Babylonian Talmud, Ain Ebel is referred to as 'En Bol, and identified as a village northwest of Safed, where minorities practiced a form of niddah in which female infants were made to undergo the ritual immersion before their mothers. Historian John T. Durward argues that Ain Ebel, located west of Kedesh of Naphtali (an ancient town documented in Judges 4:6, 10), is probably the biblical town of Beth Maacah, and was the spiritual retreat of the clergy from Tyre and Acre.Durward, John T. Holy Land and Holy Writ, The Pilgrimage Publishing Company, Baraboo, WI, 1913, page 668 On the outskirts of the village is an area called Chalaboune where Ernest Renan, a French historian and philosopher who was sent by Emperor Napoleon III to Lebanon, found ancient graves.Renan, 1864, pp. 677-8 According to Renan, Ain-Ebel had beautiful underground passages and large buildings in colossal stones and admirable carved sarcophagi in two remarkable places, Douair and Chalaboune, which he believed was the Biblical town of Shaalabbin of the Tribe of Dan.Minervini, Giulio.

The relief was transported to France where it remains today at the Louvre.Conder, C.R.; Kitchener, H.H. (1881).

Menassa described how a Frankish monk killed a wild animal in Ain Ebel.

Protestant Missionaries in the Levant: Ungodly Puritans, 1820–1860, Routledge; 1 edition (July 24, 2012), page 211 By the mid-nineteenth century, Ain Ebel had become the principal village of Christianity in the Upper Galilee, and in 1861 it was chosen for the first religious retreat organized in the Holy Land where 55 priests from the archdioceses of Tyre and Acre gathered for a reunion.Ramière, du R.

The massacres hardened Maronite opinion in favor of Jabal Amel being part of Greater Lebanon, which borders were cemented at the San Remo conference in 1920. During the French Mandate, the network of paved road expanded, coinciding with the introduction of automobiles in Lebanon. The arrival of the first car in a village became a celebratory event, and this was true in Ain Ebel, where the inhabitants, dressed in their Sunday best, gathered in the church square to welcome the first car to drive through the village.Schayegh, Cyrus and Andrew Arsan (Editors), The Routledge Handbook of the History of the Middle East Mandates, \\"Sanctity Across the Border: Pilgrimage Routes and State Control in Mandate Lebanon and Palestine\\" by Toufoul Abou Houdeib, Routledge Taylor & Francis, New York, 2015, page 387 The French planned to build an automobile road to connect the southern villages with those of Mandatory Palestine. The original plan was to build the road from Bint Jbeil via Yaroun and Rmaich, but the people of Ain Ebel protested, knowing the significance of such a road for the development of their town, and in the end, they were able to convince the French government to change the plan and have the road run through the village.Ajaka, Elias.

It is located at the entrance to the old Roman tunnel known as the Crypta Neapolitana or grotta vecchia in the Piedigrotta district of the city, between Mergellina and Fuorigrotta.  History  Virgil was the object of literary admiration and veneration before his death. In the following centuries and particularly in the Middle Ages his name became associated with legends of miraculous powers and his tomb the object of pilgrimages and pagan veneration. At the time of Virgil's death, a large bay tree was near the entrance. According to a local legend, it died when Dante died, and Petrarch planted a new one; because visitors took branches as souvenirs the second tree died as well.The Tomb Of Virgil Old and Sold Virgil's death When Virgil died at Brindisi in 19 BCE, he asked that his ashes be taken back to his villa just outside Naples. There a shrine was created for him, and sacred rites were held every year on his birthday. He was given the rites of a hero, at whose tomb the devout may find protection and counsel. Virgil's tomb became a place of pilgrimage for many centuries, with Petrarch and Boccaccio being among those who visited the tomb. Presently, the tomb serves as a tourist attraction, and still contains a tripod burner originally dedicated to Apollo. There are no human remains in the tomb, however, as Virgil's ashes were lost while being moved during the Middle Ages.Oggetto Artistico : Virgil's Tomb Parco della Tomba di Virgilio.

Nicknamed \\"The Whip\\" for his sidearm, snap-delivery, Blackwell played for the Cincinnati Reds for most of his career (1942; 1946–52). He also played with the New York Yankees (1952–53) and finished his career with the Kansas City Athletics (1955). Baseball career The , Blackwell is considered to have been one of the greatest pitchers of his era, and starred in a six-year streak in the All-Star Game from 1946 through 1951. He was the winning pitcher of the 1950 All-Star Game, getting Joe DiMaggio to ground into a game-ending double play in the 14th inning. On June 18, 1947, Blackwell pitched a 6–0 no-hitter against the Boston Braves. In his next start, June 22, against the Brooklyn Dodgers, he took a no-hitter into the ninth inning, trying to tie the achievement of his veteran Reds teammate Johnny Vander Meer from nine years earlier, of throwing consecutive no-hitters. However, the no-hit attempt was broken up by Eddie Stanky. The Reds won the game 4–0. In a 10-season career, Blackwell posted an 82–78 record with 839 strikeouts and a 3.30 ERA in 1,321 innings pitched. In 1960, he was just the eighth player ever to be inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. During a 2007 New York Mets broadcast, Blackwell was referred to as the best right-handed pitcher ever by Hall of Famer Ralph Kiner. Both Kiner and Hall of Fame catcher Roy Campanella called Blackwell the toughest pitcher they ever faced. Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully also reported that batters were genuinely afraid to face him. Blackwell's best year was 1947, when he recorded 22 wins against 8 losses, including 16 consecutive complete game victories for a weak-hitting team. At a slender 6 ft 6 inches, he was one of the first very tall pitchers, and a fearsome sight to hitters of that era. His bizarre sidearm delivery, described by a leading sports pundit as \\"looking like a man falling out of a tree\\", put unusual strain on his arm, abbreviating his success and, ultimately, his career. Along with arm problems, Blackwell had his right kidney removed in January 1949 after it became infected, and then had an emergency appendectomy in September 1950. In 1953 with the Yankees, Blackwell won both of his decisions but retired on July 6 because his arm \\"hurt too much.\\" He said that he would rest the arm, then try to pitch again the next season, and he wound up playing one more year in 1955 for the Kansas City Athletics. In 1948, Ziff-Davis Publishing Company produced \\"The Secrets of Pitching, By Ewell Blackwell\\", a short book giving good advice for young pitchers. Military service From 1943 to 1946 during World War II, Blackwell served with the United States Army in Europe where he worked as a mess sergeant. When not cooking, he had time to play baseball and conduct instructional camps with European youth prior to his March 1946 discharge.

It is owned by former driver Jimmy Means, who was the team's primary driver upon the team's founding in 1978 as a Winston Cup team known as Means Racing. The team currently fields the No. 52 Chevrolet Camaro SS full-time for J. J. Yeley and Kody Vanderwal. Winston Cup years After 44 starts driving for Bill Gray (and one for Rod Osterlund), Means made his debut as an owner in 1978 when he fielded the No. 52 Chevrolet. He had two top-tens and finished sixteenth in points. He expanded to a multi-car team briefly, fielding the No. 25 for Charlie Chamblee in the No. 25 at Nashville, the No. 53 for Cecil Gordon at North Wilkesboro Speedway, and the No. 50 for Baxter Price at Texas World Speedway. His best years driving his own car were from 1980–1983, when he finished no worse than 18th in the standings and had an average finish of 20th of better in all 4 seasons. =Later years= While remaining the primary driver of his own car, in 1983 he stepped aside for Lennie Pond at Michigan International Speedway, who finished 22nd. In 1984, Means was injured and was replaced by Dale Jarrett, Sterling Marlin, Morgan Shepherd, Roy Smith and Bobby Wawak, and Means drove the No. 52 solely for the next six years. In 1991 Means gave up the No. 52 on two occasions; Bobby Hillin, Jr. drove at Dover and Sears Point (finishing 19th and 21st), and Mike Wallace (finishing 31st and 39th) at Phoenix and Atlanta. In the early 1990s he frequently handed the wheel over to other drivers, including a Bobby Hillin Jr, who otherwise did not have rides; road racing ace Tom Kendall; future IRL champion Scott Sharp; and future Craftsman Truck Series champ Mike Skinner. He also fielded occasional second entries for other drivers, including John McFadden, Mike Potter, & Brad Teague. Means secured new sponsorship from NAPA for the 1993 season, but he was injured at Daytona. His temporary replacement was new NASCAR Rookie of the Year Jimmy Hensley. Means returned to finish 22nd at Atlanta. In what proved to be his final year as a driver, he was later 16th in the spring race at Bristol, 18th in Bristol's fall race, and 17th at Dover in September before his final race at Rockingham that fall. Besides Means' performances, the team's best result was 25th at Rockingham in February by Hensley. In 1994 the team's primary driver was Brad Teague, whose best finish in 8 starts was 22nd at Bristol in the summer. 4 other drivers competed once each in the No. 52 NAPA Ford in 1994. Mike Skinner finished 31st at Rockingham in February, Kirk Shelmerdine (former crew chief for Dale Earnhardt) was 26th at Talladega in May, Bob Keselowski was 41st at Pocono in June, and Gary Bradberry came home 30th in the season ending Hooters 500 at Atlanta. The team had sponsorship from Advance Commucations/Race Page but failed to qualify for the first few races of the season and had Gary Bradberry, Brad Teague and Randy McDonald and return at fall Darlington race but failed to make the field with Brad Teague. =Brief return in 2012= In 2012, the team returned to the Cup Series, the team formed a new Sprint Cup Team. After many problems acquiring equipment and preparing cars, the team made its Sprint Cup debut at Darlington. The team used the No. 52 which was a Toyota sponsored by Crusader Staffing. Mike Skinner parked the car after 20 laps. In 2013, Means sold his owner points to Brian Keselowski Motorsports. Xfinity Series =Car No. 52 history= In 2001, Means Racing returned to NASCAR in the Busch Series with a partnership with Moy Racing. They began the season with Teague, who ran five races total for them that season, his best finish a 38th at Watkins Glen International. Gaylord also returned to run two races, both resulting in 42nd-place finishes. Kertus Davis, Ricky Sanders and Andy Kirby also drove for the team that year. In 2002, Teague drove eleven races for the team, his best finish 38th at Nazareth Speedway. Jimmy Kitchens, Phil Bonifield and Eric Jones drove part- time as well for the team that year. Teague made 11 starts for Means in 2003, with Donnie Neuenberger running an additional two races. In 2004, Bruce Bechtel joined as another driver to the team. He made several attempts, but only made one race, at Pikes Peak. Teague continued to run with the team, his best finish being a 26th at Bristol. The next season, Shane Hall was the team's original driver, but was soon released. Eric McClure began running with the team, with a best finish of 30th at Texas Motor Speedway, but was released in favor of Neuenberger. At the Dover 200, Neuenberger flipped over the Plan B Technologies Ford Taurus on Lap 2. He was uninjured, but as that was the team's only car, the team did not run again for a year. The No. 52 returned for the 2007 Orbitz 300 at Daytona but failed to qualify with Brad Teague at the wheel. Teague, Neuenberger, Kevin Lepage, Jamie Mosley and Ian Henderson had driven throughout the season, with Scott Gaylord driving at Montreal, Phoenix and Watkins Glen. Chris Lawson attempted but did not qualify at Memphis. Neuenberger drove four races with Royal Farms sponsorship. Derrike Cope was the team's driver for the first part of 2008 season. At the Diamond Hill Plywood 200 at Darlington, Cope was replaced by Brad Teague. Teague finished 22nd, 4 laps down. Teague mostly drove the car in 2008, but Neuenberger sometimes raced with Lepage, Scott Gaylord, Tony Raines and Boris Said occasionally drove. The 2009 season in the nationwide series was up and down for Means racing, with very many drivers. They were a \\"start and park\\" operation, and missed several races. For 2011 they returned to the Nationwide series full-time in the No. 52 Chevy. Target Your Market Promotions and My 3 Sons Vending sponsored the team numerous times, and continued to do so, off and on throughout the year. After Bobby Santos III took a hard hit during practice for the season opener in Daytona, Dale Earnhardt Jr. gave the team the No. 88 backup car, on the condition that Means Racing would run the whole race with the car, and not Start and Park. Means Racing did run the whole race, they would end up finishing 17th. Since Daytona the team has run with several other drivers, including Daryl Harr, Tim Schendel and Tony Raines. Means Racing No. 52 at Road America in 2014, driven by Joey Gase For 2012, the team ran Daytona with driver former Cup driver Reed Sorenson, and then switched between drivers Tim Schendel, Kevin Lepage, Joey Gase, Justin Jennings and Ryan Ellis for one race. The team achieved a spot in the top-30 and are locked into the first five races. The teams best finish was 19th at Kansas with Gase. In 2013 the No. 52 team mainly used driver Gase, for 18 total races. Means also used Donnie Neuenberger, Lepage, Schendel and Ellis each for one race. The year's best finish was also 19th, but this time at Talladega with driver Neuenberger. Toyotas were driven for 7 of the 22 races with Chevrolet cars used the other races. In 2014 Gase is again serving as primary driver with a high finish of 11th at Talladega. The car has seen several sponsors including Donate Life, DB Sales Company, and ASC. In 2015, the team returned with Gase. At Talladega, Gase earned his first top 5 finish by finishing 5th and earned the team their first top 5 finish. In 2016, they returned with Gase. At Talladega, Gase was involved in a hard crash with Chris Cockrum. He collected a best finish of 19th at Daytona (June). He finished again 21st in the standings. In 2017, Gase started off with a high note a 7th- place finish at Daytona. David Starr at Road America in 2019. In 2018, the team signed David Starr, as Gase joined Go Green Racing. Starr finished 17th in the season opener at Daytona. In 2019, Starr continued to drive for this team. In 2020, Kody Vanderwal joined this team, running all but the first three races, which were run by JJ Yeley. =Car No. 79 history= In 2014, Means Racing field a late entry second car No. 79 start and park to complete the 40-car field. The car is the backup car from No. 52 but renumbered. Carl Long, Tim Schendel and John Jackson all drove one race each. In 2015, the team returned to complete the 40-car field. Matt Frahm drove for two races, Ryan Ellis, Zachary Bruenger and John Jackson all drove one race each. In 2016, the team returned again to complete the 40-car field. Josh Williams drove at Michigan. In 2018, the team returned with Josh Reaume behind the wheel at Kentucky. =Car No. 53 History= In 2019, Jimmy Means Racing ran with Max Tullman at Mid-Ohio.

The temple was established in 1590 by Horio Yoshiharu, who was a feudal lord, or daimyō, of Matsue in present-day Shimane Prefecture. This temple houses important historical objects that reflect the multifaceted religious and artistic atmosphere in Japan from the sixteenth century onward.  The Bell of Nanban-ji  The Bell of Nanban-ji The Bell of Nanban-ji is a Jesuit bell made in Portugal in 1577. The bell was used at Nanbanji Church, which was established by Jesuit Father Gnecchi-Soldo Organtino with the support of Oda Nobunaga in 1576. However, the church was destroyed in 1587 because Regent Toyotomi Hideyoshi made the first law against Christians in Japan. The Bell came to Shunkō-in during the Edo period. During World War II, the grandfather of the present vice-abbot buried the bell in the temple gardens to prevent destruction by the state authorities.  Kirishitan Lantern The Edo period (between 1603 and 1867) was the dark age of Japanese Christians. Christianity was banned, and Christians were systematically eliminated by the Tokugawa shogunate, or Edo bakufu. However, some Christians kept their faith and hid their religious identity. Those hidden Christians made their crosses and graves to resemble the Buddhist statues, pagodas, and stone lanterns. Shunkō-in’s hidden Christian lantern is one of those religious objects.  The Garden of Boulders, or Sazareishi-no-niwa  The Garden of Boulders, or Sazareishi-no-niwa, is the main garden of Shunkō-in. The theme of the garden is Ise Shrine, or Ise Jingū, in Mie Prefecture. Ise Shrine is the head shrine of all Shinto shrines in Japan. This garden houses a forest to Amaterasu-ōmikami, a sun goddess, and a shrine to Toyouke-no-ōmikami, a goddess of agriculture. It is common to see Buddhist and Shintō objects enshrined at the same place in Japan because until the Meiji period (in the late 19th and early 20th century), it was a popular belief in Japan that Shinto deities are various forms of the Buddha that existed to save people.  Sliding Door Panels, or fusuma-e, by Eigaku Kanō  Several sliding door panels at Shunkōin were painted by . Some of the paintings have Confucian teachings as their theme. Confucianism was very important to samurai, or warriors, during the Edo period because Confucianism taught samurai about honor, loyalty, and honesty.  Azaleas of D.T. Suzuki  Shunkō-in was one of the most important places in Japanese Buddhist philosophy in the early 20th century. D. T. Suzuki and Shin'ichi Hisamatsu, who are two of the most famous Japanese Zen Buddhist philosophers, discussed the future of Japanese Buddhism at this temple. There are azaleas planted by D.T. Suzuki in the front garden of Shunkō-in.

Born in Waterford, Grimes first played competitive hurling during his schooling at Mount Sion CBS. He arrived on the inter-county scene at the age of 17 when he first linked up with the Waterford minor team. He joined the senior team during the 1947-48 league. Grimes immediately became a regular member of the starting 15, and won two All-Ireland medals, three Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal on the field of play. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. As a member of the Munster inter-provincial team on a number of occasions, Grimes won two Railway Cup medals. At club level he was a 14-time championship and five-time senior football medallist with Mount Sion. Throughout his career Grimes made 32 championship appearances. He retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1965 championship. Early life Phil Grimes was born in Waterford in 1929 and was educated locally at the Mount Sion Schools. In a career that lasted eighteen years he also played for Waterford and Munster. Playing career =Club= Grimes played his club hurling with his local Mount Sion club. He won the first of his fourteen senior hurling county titles in 1948 when he was just out of minor ranks and was a senior player when Mount Sion won a record equalling nine consecutive county senior hurling titles (1953–62). Grimes won a further three county titles in-a-row in 1963, 1964 and 1965. He also helped Mount Sion to four county senior football titles. All his fourteen senior hurling and four senior football medals were won within a period of 18 years. =Inter- county= Grime first came to prominence as a member of the Waterford senior inter-county team in the late 1940s. He played in the first round of the Munster Championship in 1948 but emigrated to the United States shortly afterwards. He still however qualified to be presented with a set of Munster and All-Ireland medals. When Grimes returned to Ireland, he rejoined the county team and won his first Munster title on the field of play in 1957. Waterford later played Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final but did not win. Waterford lost their provincial crown in 1958 but the team bounced back in 1959 with Grimes collecting a second Munster title. Waterford subsequently lined out in the championship decider and, once again, Kilkenny provided the opposition. This game ended in a draw, but when the two sides met for the replay a few weeks later, Waterford defeated their neighbours and Grimes collected his first All-Ireland medal that was won on the field of play. In 1962 Grimes won an Oireachtas medal when Waterford defeated All-Ireland champions Tipperary. Then, in 1963, he added a National Hurling League medal to his collection before winning a third Munster title. For the third successive time Kilkenny turned out to be Waterford’s opponents in the subsequent All-Ireland final but Waterford were beaten on that occasion. After his playing days were over, he was selected at centre-field, alongside Séamus Power, on the Waterford Centenary Team 1984 and the Waterford Millennium Team 2000. Grimes was also chosen at centre-field on the Munster Millennium team 2000. =Provincial= Grimes also won Railway Cup honours with Munster in 1958 and 1960.

This instrument, labelled Crichton - London, Sold by J Berry, Aberdeen, appears to have an ebony frame with ivory scale, vernier and signature plate. The index arm and mirror supports are brass. Rather than use a sighting telescope, this instrument has a sighting pinnula. The octant, also called reflecting quadrant, is a measuring instrument used primarily in navigation. It is a type of reflecting instrument. Etymology The name octant derives from the Latin octans meaning eighth part of a circle, because the instrument's arc is one eighth of a circle. Reflecting quadrant derives from the instrument using mirrors to reflect the path of light to the observer and, in doing so, doubles the angle measured. This allows the instrument to use a one-eighth of a turn to measure a quarter-turn or quadrant. Origin of the octant =Newton's reflecting quadrant= thumbDrawing of Newton's Reflecting Quadrant. From . AB – sighting telescope CD – index arm G – horizon mirror H – index mirror PQ – graduated arc Isaac Newton's reflecting quadrant was invented around 1699. Vol. 42 at archive.org A detailed description of the instrument was given to Edmond Halley, but the description was not published until after Halley's death in 1742. It is not known why Halley did not publish the information during his life, as this prevented Newton from getting the credit for the invention that is generally given to John Hadley and Thomas Godfrey. One copy of this instrument was constructed by Thomas Heath (instrument maker) and may have been shown in Heath's shop window prior to its being published by the Royal Society in 1742. Newton's instrument used two mirrors, but they were used in an arrangement somewhat different from the two mirrors found in modern octants and sextants. The diagram on the right shows the configuration of the instrument. excerpt The 45° arc of the instrument (PQ), was graduated with 90 divisions of a half-degree each. Each such division was subdivided into 60 parts and each part further divided into sixths. This results in the arc being marked in degrees, minutes and sixths of a minute (10 seconds). Thus the instrument could have readings interpolated to 5 seconds of arc. This fineness of graduation is only possible due to the large size of the instrument - the sighting telescope alone was three to four feet long. A sighting telescope (AB), three or four feet long, was mounted along one side of the instrument. A horizon mirror was fixed at a 45° angle in front of the telescope's objective lens (G). This mirror was small enough to allow the observer to see the image in the mirror on one side and to see directly ahead on the other. The index arm (CD) held an index mirror (H), also at 45° to the edge of the index arm. The reflective sides of the two mirrors nominally faced each other, so that the image seen in the first mirror is that reflected from the second. Details of the mirrors on Newton's reflecting quadrant, showing the light paths (red) through the instrument. This image is turned 90° anticlockwise relative to the one above. With the two mirrors parallel, the index reads 0°. The view through the telescope sees directly ahead on one side and the view from the mirror G sees the same image reflected from mirror H (see detail drawing to the right). When the index arm is moved from zero to a large value, the index mirror reflects an image that is in a direction away from the direct line of sight. As the index arm movement increases, the line of sight for the index mirror moves toward S (to the right in the detail image). This shows a slight deficiency with this mirror arrangement. The horizon mirror will block the view of the index mirror at angles approaching 90°. The length of the sighting telescope seems remarkable, given the small size of the telescopes on modern instruments. This was likely Newton's choice of a way to reduce chromatic aberrations. Short–focal length telescopes, prior to the development of achromatic lenses, produced an objectionable degree of aberration, so much so that it could affect the perception of a star's position. Long focal lengths were the solution, and this telescope would likely have had both a long–focal length objective lens and a long–focal length eyepiece. This would decrease aberrations without excessive magnification. =The inventors of the octant= Two men independently developed the octant around 1730: John Hadley (1682–1744), an English mathematician, and Thomas Godfrey (1704–1749), a glazier in Philadelphia. While both have a legitimate and equal claim to the invention, Hadley generally gets the greater share of the credit. This reflects the central role that London and the Royal Society played in the history of scientific instruments in the eighteenth century. Two others who created octants during this period were Caleb Smith, an English insurance broker with a strong interest in astronomy (in 1734), and Jean-Paul Fouchy, a mathematics professor and astronomer in France (in 1732). =Hadley's versions= Hadley's reflecting quadrant. This instrument follows the form of Newton's reflecting quadrant from 1699 Hadley produced two versions of the reflecting quadrant. Only the second is well known and is the familiar octant. Hadley's reflecting quadrant Hadley's first reflecting quadrant was a simple device with a frame spanning a 45° arc. In the image at the right, from Hadley's article in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, you can see the nature of his design. A small sighting telescope was mounted on the frame along one side. One large index mirror was mounted at the point of rotation of the index arm. A second, smaller horizon mirror was mounted on the frame in the line of sight of the telescope. The horizon mirror allows the observer to see the image of the index mirror in one half of the view and to see a distant object in the other half. A shade was mounted at the vertex of the instrument to allow one to observe a bright object. The shade pivots to allow it to move out of the way for stellar observations. Observing through the telescope, the navigator would sight one object directly ahead. The second object would be seen by reflection in the horizon mirror. The light in the horizon mirror is reflected from the index mirror. By moving the index arm, the index mirror can be made to reveal any object up to 90° from the direct line of sight. When both objects are in the same view, aligning them together allows the navigator to measure the angular distance between them. Very few of the original reflecting quadrant designs were ever produced. One, constructed by Baradelle, is in the collection of the Musée de la Marine, Paris.Daumas, Maurice, Scientific Instruments of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries and Their Makers, Portman Books, London 1989 Hadley's octant Hadley's Octant. This is in the form familiar to those who have seen a sextant. Hadley's second design had the form familiar to modern navigators. The image to the right, also taken from his Royal Society publication, shows the details. He placed an index mirror on the index arm. Two horizon mirrors were provided. The upper mirror, in the line of the sighting telescope, was small enough to allow the telescope to see directly ahead as well as seeing the reflected view. The reflected view was that of the light from the index mirror. As in the previous instrument, the arrangement of the mirrors allowed the observer to simultaneously see an object straight ahead and to see one reflected in the index mirror to the horizon mirror and then into the telescope. Moving the index arm allowed the navigator to see any object within 90° of the direct view. The significant difference with this design was that the mirrors allowed the instrument to be held vertically rather than horizontally and it provided more room for configuring the mirrors without suffering from mutual interference. The second horizon mirror was an interesting innovation. The telescope was removable. It could be remounted so that the telescope viewed the second horizon mirror from the opposite side of the frame. By mounting the two horizon mirrors at right angles to each other and permitting the movement of the telescope, the navigator could measure angles from 0 to 90° with one horizon mirror and from 90° to 180° with the other. This made the instrument very versatile. For unknown reasons, this feature was not implemented on octants in general use. Comparing this instrument to the photo of a typical octant at the top of the article, one can see that the only significant differences in the more modern design are: *The location of the horizon mirror and telescope or sighting pinnula is lower. *The internal bracing of the frame is more central and robust. *The position of the shades for the index mirror is in the path between the index and horizon mirrors rather than at the top of the instrument. *Multiple shades are used to allow for different levels of shading. *Separate shades are provided on the horizon mirror for sighting a low sun position with a very bright horizon. *The second horizon mirror and accompanying alidade is not provided. =Smith's Astroscope= Drawing of Smith's Astroscope or Sea-quadrant Caleb Smith, an English insurance broker with a strong interest in astronomy, had created an octant in 1734. He called it an Astroscope or Sea-Quadrant. His used a fixed prism in addition to an index mirror to provide reflective elements. Prisms provide advantages over mirrors in an era when polished speculum metal mirrors were inferior and both the silvering of a mirror and the production of glass with flat, parallel surfaces was difficult. In the drawing to the right, the horizon element (B) could be a mirror or a prism. On the index arm, the index mirror (A) rotated with the arm. A sighting telescope was mounted on the frame (C). The index did not use a vernier or other device at the scale (D). Smith called the instrument's index arm a label, in the manner of Elton for his mariner's quadrant. Various design elements of Smith's instrument made it inferior to Hadley's octant and it was not used significantly. For example, one problem with the Astroscope was that angle of the observer's line of sight. By looking down, he had greater difficulty in observing than an orientation with his head in a normal orientation. Advantages of the octant Octant reverse side. This side is not seen in photographs very often. On the right, the thumbscrew to adjust the horizon mirror can be seen. At the top, one of the feet on which the octant rests in its case is just below the index arm axis. On the left the notepad is clearly visible. This small keystone-shaped piece of ivory, scarcely larger than a thumbnail, was used by the navigator to record his readings. The octant provided a number of advantages over previous instruments. The sight was easy to align because the horizon and the star seem to move together as the ship pitched and rolled. This also created a situation where the error in observation was less dependent on the observer, as he could directly see both objects at once. With the use of the manufacturing techniques available in the 18th century, the instruments were capable of reading very accurately. The size of the instruments was reduced with no loss of accuracy. An octant could be half the size of a Davis quadrant with no increase in error. Using shades over the light paths, one could observe the sun directly, while moving the shades out of the light path allowed the navigator to observe faint stars. This made the instrument usable both night and day. By 1780, the octant and sextant had almost completely displaced all previous navigational instruments. Production of the octant Early octants were constructed primarily in wood, with later versions incorporating ivory and brass components. The earliest mirrors were polished metal, since the technology to produce silvered glass mirrors with flat, parallel surfaces was limited. As glass polishing techniques improved, glass mirrors began to be provided. These used coatings of mercury-containing tin amalgam; coatings of silver or aluminum were not available until the 19th century. The poor optical quality of the early polished speculum metal mirrors meant that telescopic sights were not practical. For that reason, most early octants employed a simple naked-eye sighting pinnula instead. Details on an octant. This photo shows the graduated scale and the end of the index arm with the vernier. The thumbscrew used to lock the index arm position is seen below the index arm while the thumbscrew used for fine adjustment of the arm is on the left. To the right of the value 50 on the main scale, the SBR logo is engraved. The scale is directly graduated in degrees and thirds of a degree (20'). The vernier can divide the 20' intervals to the nearest minute of arc. Early octants retained some of the features common to backstaves, such as transversals on the scale. However, as engraved, they showed the instrument to have an apparent accuracy of only two minutes of arc while the backstaff appeared to be accurate to one minute. The use of the vernier scale allowed the scale to be read to one minute, so improved the marketability of the instrument. This and the ease in making verniers compared to transversals, lead to adoption of the vernier on octants produced later in the 18th century.Bennett, Jim, \\"Catadioptrics and commerce in eighteenth-century London\\", in History of Science, vol xliv, 2006, pages 247-277. Octants were produced in large numbers. In wood and ivory, their relatively low price compared to an all-brass sextant made them a popular instrument. The design was standardized with many manufacturers using the identical frame style and components. Different shops could make different components, with woodworkers specializing in frames and others in the brass components. For example, Spencer, Browning and Rust, a manufacturer of scientific instruments in England from 1787 to 1840 (operating as Spencer, Browning and Co. after 1840) used a Ramsden dividing engine to produce graduated scales in ivory. These were widely used by others and the SBR initials could be found on octants from many other manufacturers.Harriet Wynter and Anthony Turner, Scientific Instruments, Studio Vista, 1975, Examples of these very similar octants are in the photos in this article. The image at the top is essentially the same instrument as the one in the detail photos. However, they are from two different instrument makers - the upper is labelled Crichton - London, Sold by J Berry Aberdeen while the detail images are of an instrument from Spencer, Browning & Co. London. The only obvious difference is the presence of horizon shades on the Crichton octant that are not on the other. Octant details showing the double-holed sighting pinnula. Also visible is the small cover that can block one or the other of the holes. The horizon mirror is on the opposite side of the instrument. The left side is transparent while the tin amalgam on the mirrored side has completely corroded and no longer reflects light. The back of the index mirror's holder is at the top and the three circular glass shades in square frames are between the two mirrors. These octants were available with many options. A basic octant with graduations directly on the wood frame were least expensive. These dispensed with a telescopic sight, using a single- or double-holed sighting pinnula instead. Ivory scales would increase the price, as would the use of a brass index arm or a vernier. Demise of the octant In 1767 the first edition of the Nautical Almanac tabulated lunar distances, enabling navigators to find the current time from the angle between the sun and the moon. This angle is sometimes larger than 90°, and thus not possible to measure with an octant. For that reason, Admiral John Campbell, who conducted shipboard experiments with the lunar distance method, suggested a larger instrument and the sextant was developed.Gerard L'E. Turner, Nineteenth Century Scientific Instruments, Sotheby Publications, 1983, From that time onward, the sextant was the instrument that experienced significant development and improvements and was the instrument of choice for naval navigators. The octant continued to be produced well into the 19th century, though it was generally a less accurate and less expensive instrument. The lower price of the octant, including versions without telescope, made it a practical instrument for ships in the merchant and fishing fleets. One common practice among navigators up to the late nineteenth century was to use both a sextant and an octant. The sextant was used with great care and only for lunars, while the octant was used for routine meridional altitude measurements of the sun every day.May, William Edward, A History of Marine Navigation, G. T. Foulis & Co. Ltd., Henley-on- Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, This protected the very accurate and pricier sextant, while using the more affordable octant where it performs well.  Bubble octant  From the early 1930s through the end of the 1950s, several types of civilian and military bubble octant instruments were produced for use aboard aircraft.Brink, Randall, Lost Star: The Search for Amelia Earhart, W. W. Norton & Company, (1994), , , p. 32 All were fitted with an artificial horizon in the form of a bubble, which was centered to align the horizon for a navigator flying thousands of feet above the earth; some had recording features. Use and adjustment Use and adjustment of the octant is essentially identical to the navigator's sextant. Other reflecting instruments Hadley's was not the first reflecting quadrant. Robert Hooke invented a reflecting quadrant in 1684 and had written about the concept as early as 1666.Charles H. Cotter The Mariner's Sextant and the Royal Society; Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London, Vol. 33, No. 1 (August 1978), pp. 23-36. Hooke's was a single-reflecting instrument. Other octants were developed by Jean-Paul Fouchy and Caleb Smith in the early 1730s, however, these did not become significant in the history of navigation instruments.

The title page to Love Given O'er. He was born in the lower classes and orphaned when he was thirteen. It is possible that he had a sister, but her name and fate are unknown. Gould entered into domestic service. His first employer is unknown, but hints in his poetry indicate that it was a lady and that his job was as a footman. By the age of twenty, however, he had entered the employ of Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset. Dorset was known for his libertine lifestyle and his patronage of the arts, and Gould possibly learned to read and write and was afforded books to read while in Dorset's employ. He appears to have moved to the pantry side of domestic service. Poetry Gould began his poetic career with a number of odes to peers, and his odes to ladies are particularly stylized and idealistic. In the seventeenth century, a writer of an ode could expect remuneration, either in the form of a gift or, at the least, a higher fee from the bookseller in anticipation of sales to the flattered subject's supporters and family. Gould did sell his odes, but he appears to have made very little by them. In 1683, however, Gould changed employers and made a name for himself as an author by writing Love Given O'er: Or a Satyr on the Inconstancy of Woman. The poem was at least partially an imitation of Juvenal, but it pursued its theme of misogyny with a fury and detail even Juvenal would not have dared. It featured nearly pornographic detail. For example, Gould complains of the lust of women thus, \\"And now, if so much to the World’s reveal’d, Reflect on the vast store that lies conceal’d. How, oft, into their Closets they retire, Where flaming Dil– does inflame desire, And gentle Lap-d--s feed the am’rous fire. How curst is Man! when Brutes his Rivals prove, Ev’n in the sacred business of his Love! Unless Religion pious thoughts instil Shew me the Woman that would not be ill, If she, conveniently, cou’d have her will?\\" (lines 114-123) # A \\"closet\\" is a dressing-room or toilet. # The term \\"dildo\\" was capitalized, a la Rochester's To Seignore Dildo, and the omphalos is treated as a person, thus \\"Dildo does.\\" # Suspicion over lapdogs was a fixture in misogynistic satire. Watteau even depicts inappropriate use of lapdogs in a painting. These lines are less scathing than the repetition of the anecdote of the Ephesian lady (from Juvenal) who would meet her lovers at her husband's tomb, the statement that women envy the greatness of Eve's sin, and that a prostitute is far better than a wife, since she only damns the soul, while a wife will damn the soul and destroy all happiness. The poem is a merging of many tropes that were well established attacks on womankind before Gould, and the poem is programmatic in that it takes up the pride, then inconstancy, then lust of women (exactly as its title dictates). However, there is a remarkable amount of invention and specificity in each section, and those topoi he adapts from Classical and other poetry are always given a Restoration application. The particular vehemence in these scourges, along with the relentless pacing of the critique, make the poem stand out in its age and as an epitome of misogyny. The poem sold extremely well and prompted a verse epistle battle from pretended \\"Sylvia\\"s (\\"Sylvia\\" having spurned the poet, he vows to be quit of love) who would offer to defend women from Gould's cruelty and pretended \\"answers\\" from the author of Love Given O'er (even though few of the \\"Sylvia\\" poems were by women, and only one of the \\"answer\\" poems was by Gould (a year after the publication of the Love Given O'er)) (Sloan). Gould enjoyed a high profile, and in the same year, 1683, Gould was employed by James Bertie, 1st Earl of Abingdon. If Abingdon was not the one who encouraged the poem's composition, he at least enjoyed having the celebrated poet in his household. At around this time, Gould also became a friend of Fleetwood Sheppard's, who appeared to treat the poet with great generosity. The next poems from Gould continued the misogyny of Love Given O'er (e.g. A Satyr on Wooing, Epistle to One Made Unhappy in Marriage, A Scourge for Ill Wives, inter al.) and attempted to broaden out the satire into an attack on human vanity in particular and mankind in general. Gould's A Satyr on Mankind was, in its own day, noted for its excellence, and Alexander Pope paraphrases it. Additionally, Jonathan Swift uses some of the same satirical figures, and it is likely that both authors had read Gould in the 1709 version of his poems. Also in 1683 (on 17 June), Gould married Martha Roderick, and the two would later have a daughter named Hannah. Between 1683 and 1689, Gould produced a number of satires, some of them providing unique insight into the English Restoration. Satyr Upon the Play-House (1688), for example, attacked the parentage and pretense of Elizabeth Barry and Thomas Betterton, as well as the dissipate, drunken, whoring patrons of the theater. It records the life of London around Covent Garden, complete with demobbed soldiers, thieves, prostitutes, and the nobility who only cover their filth in gold, cosmetics, and perfumes. He also produced a few topical satires, such as To Julian, Secretary of the Muses, which attacks an anonymous lampoon author and gives specific detail about the personalities and personages of some of the dramatists of the day. He even wrote a poem in honour of a retarded villager of Lavington before, two years later, writing a violent attack on the stupidity and obduracy of all the \\"simple folk\\" of the country. By 1689, Gould had been employed by Abingdon on his estates in West Lavington, Wiltshire, in some capacity other than as a domestic. In that year, Gould published Poems, Mostly Satyrs. The book was a last-chance effort at financial independence for Gould, and it appears to have succeeded. Gould left domestic service and, with the help of Abingdon, became a teacher full-time in West Lavington. However, the year after the publication of Poems, Gould engaged in a bitter exchange with the Poet Laureate, John Dryden. Gould was infuriated by Dryden's change of religion, and his Jack Squab (a reference to the Laureate being paid with food as well as brandy) was one of the most vicious (and uncharacteristically crude, for Gould) attacks made on Dryden. The poem is only attributed to Gould on slim evidence, as there are figures of speech and metaphors in it that closely resemble those employed by Gould in The Play-House, but it was not collected into his later Works (1709) and is unusually directed at a single public figure (where Gould's previous habit had been to attack a sin and provide numerous examples of it rather than to devote a whole poem to the viciousness of a single person). After 1692 and the second edition of Poems, mostly Satyrs, Gould did not publish again until his death (excepting The Rival Sisters, see below). Having left the household of a peer and having left London, Gould had few occasions for urbane satires. However, the profession of school master apparently left the author with time for revision, for during the two decades that followed, he revised and edited and supplemented his poems extensively. In 1709, Martha Gould, Robert's wife, had Works of Robert Gould published. Robert Gould himself died in January 1709 (1708 in the Old Style), before the volume's publication. However, the text of the Works has high authority, and every element of the volume appears to have been carefully set by the author. The Satyr on Mankind and Satyr on the Play House, in particular, were vastly rewritten. As a tragedian Gould also wrote tragedy. His first tragedy, Innocence Distress'd, was never performed. He took it to the United Company soon after writing it, in 1689. Thomas Betterton was the de facto manager of the theater, and Elizabeth Barry was one of the star actresses. Whether Gould had offended them prior to Satyr on the Play House or not, the two stars would not give him any aid after it. In October 1695, Gould's second tragedy, The Rival Sisters, was performed at Drury Lane, even though, again, Betterton and Barry opposed it. (By that time, Gould says in the introduction to the 1709 Works, Betterton had forgiven him, but Barry remained obstinate. Therefore, in the 1709 Works, Gould adds another section of the Satyr on the Play House just for Barry and lessens the invective against Betterton.) The tragedy had music by Henry Purcell, and it was a moderate success by the standards of that troubled year. (See Restoration drama for more on the crises of 1695.) Style and literary importance In content, Gould was a sincere, harsh Royalist. In his satires, the families and ancestors of living noblemen are ridiculed viciously, if they took the Cromwellian side in the English Civil War. Additionally, Gould not only asserts Church of England positions, but he has nothing but vitriol for radical Protestants, from Richard Baxter to George Fox onward. His attacks on ladies and lords show all the marks of estrangement. They are attacked for being less than they would appear. Gould appeared to believe that the nobility should be, in fact, better than the general run of mankind. It is the lie that enrages him most, with betrayal being next in his catalogue of sins to lash. Stylistically, Robert Gould's poetry looks forward somewhat to the poetry of the 1710s. He was the friend of John Oldham, and there is some similarity in poetic forms. He was also a friend of Fleetwood Shepheard, addressing several poems to him. Shepheard was a confidante to Matthew Prior and Thomas Rymer, and Shepheard gave both financial aid to Gould and personal friendship (Sloan). He wrote almost exclusively in closed heroic couplets. Other than Dryden, whose poetic output was lowering, few poets of the 1680s are well preserved, and Gould occupies an interesting position. He is a generation younger than the primary Restoration wits (Dryden, Rochester, Buckingham) and younger even than Aphra Behn. His is the first Restoration generation, and he had only stories about the Interregnum. He is additionally unique in the literature of the Restoration in being a servant who composed poetry. While the Restoration had many figures who rose from common, or even poor, families, Gould used his writing to win his independence in the most literal way. His pen earned him a profession other than servitude and enabled him to escape a menial life, and, at the same time, allowed him to treat wealthy and established figures on an even footing. Although Gould was apparently well known to his own and the next two generations of poets, his reputation was virtually erased in the nineteenth century. By the 1730s, when Alexander Pope began to reject the \\"licentious\\" Restoration poets and other \\"Tory\\" writers gradually distanced themselves from the Cavalier wits, Gould's works fell out of publication and public consciousness. Because his satires are sexually frank and exceptionally vicious, he was wholly unacceptable to the Victorian era critics who attempted literary histories and were responsible for the twentieth century's canon formation in literature. At the end of the twentieth century, his name was revived as an example solely of \\"subliterary misogyny\\" by feminist literary critics such as Felicity Nussbaum, whose The Brink of All We Hate held out Gould's most scabrous satires (and almost exclusively Love Given O'er and the passage quoted above) as typical of an unpreserved tradition of misogyny. There remains one biography of Gould (by Eugene Sloan) and no contemporary edition of his works. References *Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison, eds.

Pakula and starring Jane Fonda and Kris Kristofferson. The film was nominated for a Razzie Award for Worst Actor for Kristofferson. Plot Lee Winters (Fonda) is the widow of the Chairman and primary stockholder of Winterchem Enterprises, a chemical company, who is attempting to obtain financing of the purchase of a processing plant in Spain, while trying to determine why her husband was murdered. Apparently, her late husband discovered some damning information about an Account Number 21214, a secret slush fund involving asset transfers. Respected financier Hubbell Smith (Kristofferson) takes over as president of Borough National Bank at the request of First New York Bank chairman Maxwell Emery (Cronyn), in an attempt to have Smith discover the financial status of Borough National. Smith discovers that the bank isn't just in trouble, it's essentially so insolvent that it can't even pay its next dividend. It needs to find a customer who needs to borrow a lot of money and either loan the money or act as broker in the deal in order to raise some quick cash and stave off intervention by the Federal Reserve. One of the largest customers of Borough National is Winterchem, but because of federal lending limits, the bank \\"can't loan them a dime\\" but conceivably could be involved in brokering a deal between Winterchem and some other lender capable of loaning the approximately $500 million needed to buy the plant, and the bank would receive a 1% finder's fee for making the arrangement. Smith becomes involved, both financially and romantically, with Winters in her attempts to finance the purchase of the petrochemical plant and in the discovery of the mystery of account 21214. They finally do so by brokering a deal with some Arab investors who take control of her stock as security for the transaction. Smith later discovers that account 21214 is actually a slush fund where Emery is moving money belonging to the Arabs into gold as a safe haven against potential losses if the dollar collapses. The Arabs are extremely worried that if anyone finds out, their assets will vanish in a public panic as American currency becomes worthless. Winters also discovers the Arabs are behind account 21214, and wants her stock back in exchange for her silence; she has overheard part of Smith's conversation with Emery and mistakenly believes he was double-crossing her. A fake limo driver who is actually working for the Arab investors tries to kidnap her with the intent of killing her—as it turns out they did to her husband—to prevent her from disclosing what she knows, and when the attempt on her life fails, the Arabs panic and pull all of their money out of every bank in America, and possibly the entire world. The globe is gripped by panic and rioting as people discover all of their money is now worthless. Emery is shown in his office - dead, an apparent suicide. The economic crisis paralyzes the world, but by spilling over boundaries between east and west blocs, and between developing and industrialized nations, it also unites the world in common cause. In the penultimate scene, workers at Borough National stand idle while listening to a report of the growing economic crisis. As the camera pans across the trading floor of the bank, the viewer sees that it's now empty of workers, the lights off, the desks and machines covered - completely inactive. Only Smith remains. Winters joins him in the final scene. Smith tells her that he's looking for a way to start anew. Winters offers to become his partner.

He lived most of his life in a log house along the Dead Mare Branch of Little Carr Creek, Knott County, Kentucky. He was best known for the novel River of Earth, which depicted the struggles of coal mining in eastern Kentucky. Life =Early life= Lonie, Still's mother was sixteen when she moved to Alabama due to a tornado destroying the family home. His father, J. Alex Still, was a horse doctor with no formal training. James Still was born July 16, 1906 near Lafayette, Alabama. Still was considered a quiet child but a hard worker. He along with his nine siblings worked the family farm. They farmed cotton, sugar cane, soybeans and corn. At the age of seven, Still began grade school. He found greater interest not in the school text books but at home where there was an edition of the Cyclopedia of Universal Knowledge. He became enriched with philosophy, physics and the great British poets – Shakespeare and Keats. =Education= After graduating from high school, Still attended Lincoln Memorial University of Harrogate, Tennessee. He worked at the rock quarry in the afternoons and as a library janitor in the evenings. He would often sleep at the library after spending the night reading countless literature. Upon graduation in 1929, he began graduate work at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. While at Vanderbilt, he became involved in a controversial miner strike in Wilder, Tennessee. The miners were starving due to holding the picket line; Still delivered a truckload of food and clothing for the miners. Still graduated with an MA in English in 1930. He later completed additional graduate work at the University of Illinois. =Career= Still tried various professions including the Civil Service Corps, Bible salesman, and even a stint picking cotton in Texas. His friend Don West—a poet and civil rights activist, among other things—offered Still a job organizing recreation programs for a Bible school in Knott County, Kentucky. Still accepted the position but soon became a volunteer librarian at the Hindman Settlement School. Knott County would become Still's lifelong home, though for many years he was the creative force behind the Morehead Writers' Workshop at nearby Morehead State University, where he taught literature during the 1960s. James Still served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army in World War II and was stationed in Egypt in 1944. =Literature= Still moved into a two-story log house once occupied by a crafter of dulcimers, Jethro Amburgey. He would remain here till his death. Here, he began writing his masterpiece, River of Earth. It was published February 5, 1940. River of Earth is a discussion of change in Appalachia, depicted as the struggles of a family trying to survive by either subsisting off the land or entering the coal mines of the Cumberland Plateau in the reaches of eastern Kentucky. This tension is depicted in the tension between Brack and Alpha Baldridge. Alpha Baldridge longs for settled solidity. \\"Forever I've wanted to set us down in a lone spot, a place certain and enduring, with room to swing arm and elbow, . . . . So many places we've lived—the far side of one mine camp and next the slag pile of another. I'm longing to set me down shorely and raise my chaps proper (50–51).\\" Conversely, her husband Brack is committed to the mines and answers her as the family provider: \\"It was never meant for a body to be full content on the face of this earth. Against my wont it is to be treading the camps, but its bread I'm hunting, regular bread with a mite of grease on it. To make and provide, it's the only trade I know, and I work willing (51).\\" His version of stability is perhaps more transitory than hers. She longs to see things grow of a season, whether gardens or children; he looks for the high-return of mine work, despite the dangers (which are not major factors in the book) and the irregularity of the work. She is willing to trade the sentence of living from hand to mouth through the year for the security of a personal place; he, to endure famine for the short seasons of feasting that mine work allows. The perspectives of both characters represent the dead-end choices of Appalachians who chose to remain in the hills. Still received the Southern Author's Award shortly after publication, which he shared with Thomas Wolfe for Wolfe's work You Can't Go Home Again. Still went on to publish a few collections of poetry and short stories, a juvenile novel and a compilation of Appalachian local color he collected over the years. The children's book \\"Jack and the Wonderbeans\\" was adapted for the stage by the Lexington Children's Theatre in 1992.

They danced dressed as men. The word shirabyōshi can also refer to the songs they sang and the dances they performed. The profession of shirabyōshi became popular in the 12th century. They would perform for the nobility, and at celebrations. They are sometimes referred to as courtesans in the English language, but by nature they were performers. Some shirabyōshi did sometimes sleep with their patrons and give birth to nobles' children, but this was not their intended purpose as entertainers. The best known shirabyōshi were Shizuka Gozen, Giō and Hotoke featured in The Tale of the Heike. History The name shirabyōshi may be interpreted as \\"white beat\\" or \\"simple rhythm\\"; it may refer to the white suikan robe they wore, or alternatively the rhythm of the songs that they sang and danced to. means \\"white\\", although scholars believe that it should be interpreted as \\"plain\\" (素, also pronounced shira); in this interpretation shirabyōshi therefore refers to the lack of musical accompaniment apart from the rhythmic hyōshi percussion. Shirabyōshi appeared during the mid-Heian period. During a time of transition of power and societal change, a change in fortune for some aristocratic families resulted in the daughters of these families needing to perform as shirabyōshi in order to survive. As educated and cultured ladies, they become a superior group of courtesans noted for their singing, dancing and poetry as well as beauty. Shirabyōshi became popular as entertainers in the 12th century, and many women then chose to be shirabyōshi because of their popularity. A shirabyōshi was always a woman who dressed in men's attire. They were popular in the late Heian and early Kamakura period in the 12th century, but during the 13th century, their status declined. They disappeared around the end of the Kamakura or the beginning of the Muromachi period in the 14th century. It has been said that the shirabyōshi culture greatly influenced Noh drama by bringing forth kusemai, an unorthodox form of dancing, and introducing it to Noh. Attire and appearance Shirabyōshi were recognizable for the outfit they would wear, which was Shinto-inspired. It was a man's outfit and featured the following: * A tate-eboshi hat, tall black hat worn at court * A tachi, a samurai's sword * Red hakama, worn primarily by men * White suikan and red suikan, a male Shinto outfit * A kawahori hand fan, which men carried Shirabyōshi wore the trademark white facial make-up that would centuries later come to be associated with geisha, completely covering their face and neck and painting new eyebrows higher on the forehead. Their hair was rather simple: it was long (sometimes nearly to the floor) and pulled back into a loose ponytail secured with a ribbon called a takenaga. The tate-eboshi hat and the sword were only worn by shirabyōshi in the early period, and in later eras, they danced only in white suikan, which gave rise to the belief that shirabyōshi were named after the robe they wore. Music Shirabyōshi songs were mostly based on Buddhist prayers. The songs were usually slow and rhythmic, with great meaning in the words. They also would sing imayo songs, which were poems using images of nature to convey meanings of circumstances in their lives. These songs typically had lines of seven and five syllables. Trademarks of their music included their voices, the drum and the flute. Famous shirabyōshi =Shizuka= Shizuka, commonly referred to as Shizuka Gozen, was the concubine and lover of Minamoto no Yoshitsune, the tragic hero of many folk legends. She was possibly born in 1168, and is popular in folk legends herself. She and Yoshitsune met and fell in love, but by the time she had become pregnant, Yoshitsune was on the run for his life. She was captured and taken to the shōgun, Minamoto no Yoritomo in Kamakura, Yoshitsune's older brother. There she gave birth to a son, who was, according to some versions of the tales, promptly killed by his uncle Yoritomo, but survived in others. In some tales Shizuka was then forced to perform a dance for Yoritomo and his wife Hōjō Masako at a temple celebration, where she sang a song of praise for her love Yoshitsune. This greatly angered Yoritomo, and he intended on having her put to death but Masako begged for her life. Shizuka was freed and sought to follow Yoshitsune, but she learned of his death. She became a nun and died in 1189. Her song is famous and is still sung today by geisha. =Giō and Hotoke= The story of Giō and Hotoke, featured in the Heike Monogatari, is long and involved, but basically tells of the most famous shirabyōshi Giō, who had won the heart of Taira no Kiyomori, being ousted by a younger and more talented shirabyōshi named Hotoke. Kiyomori cruelly sent Giō away, which grieved her greatly, and Hotoke was constantly ridden with guilt. A year later, Giō was asked to perform a dance for Hotoke at Kiyomori's command, who actually intended on humiliating her. In her grief and humiliation, Giō, her sister and their mother became nuns seeking for a happier life. A few years later, the guilt was too great for Hotoke and she too became a nun. She asked for forgiveness from Giō, who willingly forgave her and the four women lived out the rest of their days in prayer.

Applied Surface Science 253, 5258–5267. crystals of dioxouranium nitrate hexahydrate are triboluminescent. Uranyl nitrate can be prepared by reaction of uranium salts with nitric acid. It is soluble in water, ethanol, acetone, and ether, but not in benzene, toluene, or chloroform. Uses During the first half of the 19th century, many photosensitive metal salts had been identified as candidates for photographic processes, among them uranyl nitrate. The prints thus produced were called uranium prints, urbanities, or more commonly, uranotypes. The first uranium printing processes were invented by Scotsman J. Charles Burnett between 1855 and 1857, and used this compound as the sensitive salt. Burnett authored a 1858 article comparing \\"Printing by the Salts of the Uranic and Ferric Oxides\\" The process employs the ability of the uranyl ion to pick up two electrons and reduce to the lower oxidation state of uranium(IV) under ultraviolet light. Uranotypes can vary from print to print from a more neutral, brown russet to strong Bartolozzi red, with a very long tone grade. Surviving prints are slightly radioactive, a property which serves as a means of non-destructively identifying them. Several other more elaborate photographic processes employing the compound appeared and vanished during the second half of the 19th century with names like Wothlytype, Mercuro-Uranotype and the Auro-Uranium process. Uranium papers were manufactured commercially at least until the end of the 19th century, vanishing due to the superior sensitivity and practical advantages of silver halides. From the 1930s through the 1950s Kodak Books described a uranium toner (Kodak T-9) using uranium nitrate hexahydrate. Some alternative process photographers including Blake Ferris and Robert Schramm continue to make uranotype prints today. Along with uranyl acetate it is used as a negative stain for viruses in electron microscopy; in tissue samples it stabilizes nucleic acids and cell membranes. Uranyl nitrate was used to fuel Aqueous Homogeneous Reactors in the 1950s as an alternative to the more corrosive uranyl sulfate. However, research focus was on heterogeneous reactor designs and the experiments were abandoned. Uranyl nitrate is important for nuclear reprocessing. It is the compound of uranium that results from dissolving the decladded spent nuclear fuel rods or yellowcake in nitric acid, for further separation and preparation of uranium hexafluoride for isotope separation for preparing of enriched uranium. Health and environmental issues Uranyl nitrate is an oxidizing and highly toxic compound. When ingested, it causes severe chronic kidney disease and acute tubular necrosis and is a lymphocyte mitogen. Target organs include the kidneys, liver, lungs and brain. It also represents a severe fire and explosion risk when heated or subjected to shock in contact with oxidizable substances.

Her home port is Norfolk, Virginia. On 13 July 2006 Grapple was decommissioned from US Navy service and converted to civilian operation by Military Sealift Command. She was redesignated as USNS Grapple (T-ARS 53). Role Rescue and salvage ships render assistance to disabled ships, provide towing, salvage, diving, firefighting and heavy lift capabilities. The mission of the rescue and salvage ships is fourfold: to debeach stranded vessels, heavy lift capability from ocean depths, towing of other vessels, and manned diving operations. For rescue missions, these ships are equipped with fire monitors forward and amidships which can deliver either firefighting foam or sea water. The salvage holds of these ships are outfitted with portable equipment to provide assistance to other vessels in dewatering, patching, supply of electrical power and other essential service required to return a disabled ship to an operating condition. The Navy has responsibility for salvaging U.S. government-owned ships and, when it is in the best interests of the United States, privately owned vessels as well. The rugged construction of these steel-hulled ships, combined with speed and endurance, make these rescue and salvage ships well-suited for rescue/salvage operations of Navy and commercial shipping throughout the world. The versatility of this class of ship enables the U.S. Navy to render assistance to those in peril on the high seas. Capabilities Grapple is designed to perform combat salvage, lifting, towing, off-ship firefighting, manned diving operations, and emergency repairs to stranded or disabled vessels. =Salvage of disabled and stranded vessels= Disabled or stranded ships might require various types of assistance before retraction or towing can be attempted. In her salvage hold, Grapple carries transportable cutting and welding equipment, hydraulic and electric power sources, and de-watering gear. Grapple also has salvage and machine shops, and hull repair materials to effect temporary hull repairs on stranded or otherwise damaged ships. =Retraction of stranded vessels= Stranded vessels can be retracted from a beach or reef by the use of Grapple's towing machine and propulsion. Additional retraction force can be applied to a stranded vessel through the use of up to six legs of beach gear, consisting of STATO anchors, wire rope, chain, and salvage buoys. In a typical configuration, two legs of beach gear are rigged on board Grapple, and up to four legs of beach are rigged to the stranded vessel. In addition to the standard legs of beach gear, Grapple carries 4 spring buoys. The spring buoys are carried beneath the port and starboard bridge wings. Each spring buoy weighs approximately , is long and in diameter, provides a net buoyancy of 7½ tons, and can withstand 125 tons of pull-through force. The spring buoys are used with beach gear legs rigged from a stranded vessel when deep water is found seaward of the stranded vessel. =Towing= Grapple's propulsion machinery provides a bollard pull (towing force at zero speed and full power) of 68 tons. The centerpiece of Grapple's towing capability is an Almon A. Johnson Series 322 double-drum automatic towing machine. Each drum carries of drawn galvanized, 6×37 right-hand lay, wire-rope towing hawsers, with closed zinc-poured sockets on the bitter end. The towing machine uses a system to automatically pay in and pay out the towing howser to maintain a constant strain. The automatic towing machine also includes a Series 400 traction winch that can be used with synthetic line towing hawsers up to 14 inches in circumference. The traction winch has automatic payout but only manual recovery. The Grapple's caprail is curved to fairlead and prevent chafing of the towing hawser. It includes two vertical stern rollers to tend the towing hawser directly aft and two Norman pin rollers to prevent the towing hawser from sweeping forward of the beam at the point of tow. The stern rollers and Norman pins are raised hydraulically and can withstand a lateral force of at mid barrel. Two tow bows provide a safe working area on the fantail during towing operations. Grapple tows Inflict, Fearless and Illusive. , and were towed to the Gulf of Oman by USS Grapple (ARS-53), which departed Little Creek, Virginia on 6 September 1987. They traveled via the Suez Canal and arrived in the Gulf of Oman on 2 November 1987. At the time, the trip was the longest distance three ships were towed by one. =Manned diving operations= Grapple has several diving systems to support different types of operations. Divers descend to diving depth on a diving stage that is lowered by one of two powered davits. The diving locker is equipped with a double-lock hyperbaric chamber for recompression after deep dives or for the treatment of divers suffering from decompression sickness. The MK21 MOD1 diving system supports manned diving to depths of on surface-supplied air. A fly-away mixed gas system can be used to enable the support of diving to a maximum depth of . The MK20 MOD0 diving system allows-surface supplied diving to a depth of with lighter equipment. Grapple carries SCUBA equipment for dives that require greater mobility than is possible in tethered diving. =Recovery of submerged objects= In addition to her two main ground tackle anchors ( Navy standard stockless or balanced-fluke anchors) Grapple can use equipment associated with her beach gear to lay a multi-point open water moor to station herself for diving and ROV operations. A typical four-point-moor consists of an X pattern with four Stato Anchors at the outside corners and Grapple at the center, made fast to a spring buoy for the close end of each mooring leg with synthetic mooring lines. Using her capstans, Grapple can shorten or lengthen the mooring line for each leg and change her position within the moor. Grapple has a 7.5-ton-capacity boom on her forward kingpost and a 40-ton-capacity boom on her aft kingpost. =Heavy lift= Grapple has heavy lift system that consists of large bow and stern rollers, deck machinery, and tackle. The rollers serve as low-friction fairlead for the wire rope or chain used for the lift. The tackle and deck machinery provide up to 75 tons of hauling for each lift. The two bow rollers can be used together with linear hydraulic pullers to achieve a dynamic lift of 150 tons. The stern rollers can be used with the automatic towing machine to provide a dynamic lift of 150 tons. All four rollers can be used together for a dynamic lift of 300 tons or a static tidal lift of 350 tons. Grapple also has two auxiliary bow rollers, which can support a 75-ton lift when used together. =Off-ship fire-fighting= Grapple has three manually operated fire monitors, one on the forward signal bridge, one on the aft signal bridge, and one on the forecastle, that can deliver up to 1,000 gallons per minute of seawater or aqueous film forming foam (AFFF) When originally built, Grapple had a fourth remotely controlled fire monitor mounted on her forward kingpost, but this was later removed. Grapple has a 3,600 gallon foam tank. =Emergency ship salvage material= In addition to the equipment carried by Grapple, the US Navy Supervisor of Salvage maintains a stock of additional emergency fly-away salvage equipment that can be deployed aboard the salvage ships to support a wide variety of rescue and salvage operations. Awards In 2000, Grapple won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. Operations = Bodo, Norway = In September of 1988, LST-1190 USS Boulder, ran aground on a shoal in a Norwegian fjord during Exercise: Teamwork. The Grapple, along with two Norwegian tugs removed Boulder from the shoal. As of February, 2019, Grapple is berthed behind Boulder and three Charleson-class vessels. =Adriatic Sea (F-16 recovery)= =Newfoundland's Botwood Harbor= In July 2014, Grapple was in Newfoundland's Botwood Harbor for the body recovery from a 1940s plane wreck. =Corsica (Calvi)= In October 2012, Grapple supported research operation diving on a sea landing B-17 in WWII =Atlantic Ocean, 100km (62 miles) south of Nantucket= In November 1999, Grapple participated in the salvage operation of EgyptAir Flight 990. =St. Margarets Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada= In September 1998, Grapple helped in the recovery of Swissair Flight 111. Status Grapple was placed in \\"Out of Service, in Reserve\\" on 1 October 2016. and is stored in the Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

His novels and screenplays explore the political and economic struggles of working-class Northern England, particularly in his native West Riding/South Yorkshire. He is best known for the novel A Kestrel for a Knave (1968), which he helped adapt for Ken Loach's film Kes (1969). He collaborated with Loach on adaptations of his novels Looks and Smiles and The Gamekeeper, and the 1977 two-part television drama The Price of Coal. He also wrote the television film Threads, which depicts the impact of a nuclear war on Sheffield. Early life Hines was born in the mining village of Hoyland Common near Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire. He attended Ecclesfield Grammar School and played football for the England Grammar Schools team. After leaving school with five O levels he took a job with the National Coal Board as an apprentice mining surveyor at Rockingham Colliery. A neighbour he chanced to meet at the coal face disapproved of his failure to meet his potential; Hines later said that was when he decided to return to school to take his examinations. He achieved four A levels and studied for a teaching qualification at Loughborough College. For his dissertation, Hines wrote a piece of creative fiction entitled \\"Flight of the Hawk\\", which later inspired his debut novel The Blinder. He worked as a Physical Education teacher for several years, initially for two years in a London comprehensive school and subsequently at Longcar Central School in Barnsley, where he wrote novels in the school library after the children had gone home. He later became a full-time writer. Hines was a keen amateur footballer who played for Barnsley's reserves and was invited to a trial at Manchester United. He later played for Loughborough College, Crawley Town and Stocksbridge Works. He also represented England Schoolboys. Career = Early work and A Kestrel for a Knave (1965-70) = Hines' first published work was the play Billy's Last Stand, written while he worked as a PE teacher alongside his debut novel, The Blinder. A duologue between an impoverished coal-miner and his manipulative business partner, it first appeared on the BBC Radio Third Programme in 1965, with Arthur Lowe and Ronald Baddiley.'Some Corruptions of Power.' The Times (London, England), Friday, 13 August 1965; pg. 11; Issue 56399 The broadcast of Billy's Last Stand found Hines a publisher for The Blinder, which was published in 1966. It follows a gifted teenage footballer torn between his sporting career and his academic aspirations. The novel was partly based on Hines' own experiences playing youth football, as he had played for Barnsley FC's youth team and was offered trials at Manchester United. The Blinder caught the attention of film and television producer Tony Garnett. He approached Hines about the possibility of writing a Wednesday Play for the BBC, but Hines told him he had \\"got this book going round my head and I need to write it\\". He received a bursary from the BBC to take a sabbatical from his teaching work to write the novel on a retreat on the island of Elba. Garnett and Ken Loach, who had worked together on the Wednesday Plays Up the Junction and Cathy Come Home, read the manuscript to the unpublished novel and purchased the rights for their new production company Kestrel Films in July 1967. A Kestrel for a Knave was published in 1968. It tells the story of Billy Casper, a troubled and neglected schoolboy living in a mining village who finds comfort in tending a kestrel that he names 'Kes'. Hines was inspired by the experiences of his brother Richard, who tamed a hawk of the same name in his youth. He co-wrote the script for the film version Kes (1969) with Loach and Garnett. Disney later offered to buy the rights on the condition that the downbeat ending, in which Billy's brother Jud kills the kestrel, be changed; Hines refused. The film was shot on location around Hines' native Barnsley and Hoyland Common. Released in November 1969, it became a critical and commercial success and has subsequently become regarded as one of the greatest British films ever made. = Further collaborations with Loach (1971-81) = Hines continued writing novels, plays and television scripts throughout the 1970s, with much of his output centring on the tensions of labour and industry that characterised British society at the time. He adapted Billy's Last Stand for the theatre in 1971, with the titular character played by Ian McKellen, and published First Signs, a novel following a young expatriate in Italy returning to his northern hometown, in 1972. He contributed two scripts for the BBC's Play for Today strand; Speech Day in 1973 and Two Men from Derby in 1976. In 1975, Hines wrote The Gamekeeper, a novel about a former steelworker who becomes a gamekeeper on a ducal estate, which he adapted to film with Loach in 1980. Further collaborations with Loach in this period included the 1977 two-part television drama, The Price of Coal. The first part, \\"Meet the People\\", follows a royal visit to a colliery while the second part, \\"Back to Reality\\", follows an accident that claims the lives of several pit workers. The fourth and final collaboration with Loach was Looks and Smiles, published as a novel in 1980 and adapted as film in 1981. Following the daily life of an unemployed 17-year-old in Sheffield, it began as a screenplay about teenage relationships, before the issue of unemployment became central to the narrative. It competed at the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Young Cinema Award. In these projects, Hines' involvement in the filmmaking process exceeded the typical expectations of a screenwriter; he was involved in casting decisions alongside Loach, attended shoots and participated in the editing process. = Threads and late career (1984-2009) = In 1984, Hines wrote the script for the BAFTA award-winning TV film Threads (1984), a speculative television drama examining the effects of nuclear war on Sheffield. The BBC had commissioned the drama and hired Mick Jackson to direct after he produced the Q.E.D. documentary A Guide to Armageddon in 1982. Jackson hired Hines to write the screenplay because he wanted a social realist tone. Hines focused the narrative on a young couple in Sheffield dealing with an unexpected pregnancy as the threat of nuclear exchange escalates. Although Sheffield was chosen due to its proximity to RAF bases and geographical centrality, it also continued Hines' tradition of setting his work in and around South Yorkshire. In contrast to the harmonious collaboration with Loach, Hines had a strained relationship with Jackson; according to his wife Eleanor, he disliked Jackson due to his class background while Jackson was frustrated by the amount of time Hines spent on set. However, the film was a critical success, winning a BAFTA award for Best Television Drama. Hines received a personal letter of praise from Labour leader Neil Kinnock, and Jackson claims that the film was viewed by Ronald Reagan when it was broadcast on American television the following year. After Threads, Hines' output became more sporadic. In the early 1990s, he wrote two television plays about football; Shooting Stars, about three friends who hold a local star striker to ransom, was broadcast on Channel 4 in 1990, and Born Kicking, about the first professional female footballer, was broadcast on BBC1 in 1992. His penultimate novel, The Heart of It, was published in 1994 and returned to the subject of coal-mining, depicting a Hollywood screenwriter returning home to visit his father, a communist former miner and veteran of the 1984-85 miner's strike. In 2003, Loach was in contact with Hines about adapting the novel for film, but Hines refused because he felt \\"the ideas had gone stale\\". His final novel was Elvis Over England, published in 2000 to mixed reviews; it follows a road trip undertaken by an unemployed Elvis fanatic who undertakes a road trip to Prestwick, Scotland, the only place Elvis ever set foot in the U.K. In 2009, after Hines' diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease prevented him from further writing, Pomona Books published This Artistic Life, an anthology of previously unpublished short stories mostly written around the time of A Kestrel for a Knave.  Style and themes  According to Dave Gibson, Hines' work is \\"characterised by his ear for dialogue, his sympathetic use of Barnsley dialect and his identification with working class struggles\\". His writing has been described as social realist. Imogen Carter notes that A Kestrel for a Knave features \\"dazzling natural imagery, reminiscent of Seamus Heaney's 1966 poetry collection, Death of a Naturalist.\\" Hines's work frequently addressed contemporary British social issues, such as education in A Kestrel for a Knave, unemployment in Looks and Smiles, and working conditions and industrial action in the mining industry in The Price of Coal and The Heart of It. Football appears extensively in his writing; Hines recalled that being told he \\"knew what the game was all about\\" by a professional footballer was one of the best critiques he had received.  Recognition  Hines' work has received significant recognition. Kes won a number of awards, including a Writers' Guild of Great Britain Award for Best British Screenplay and a BAFTA nomination for Best Screenplay. Threads (1984) won a special award at the 1985 Monte-Carlo Television Festival, the Broadcasting Press Guild Award in 1985 for Best Single Drama, and was nominated for seven different awards in the 1985 BAFTA Awards, winning the Best Single Drama award. Hines claimed he took no pleasure in receiving awards; his main concern was the approval of working- class readers, and the confirmation that they had been represented accurately. Some of his readers claimed that A Kestrel for a Knave was the only book they had ever read. Ian McMillan wrote that \\"here in the former South Yorkshire coalfield A Kestrel for a Knave is our Moby-Dick, our Things Fall Apart, our Great Gatsby.\\" Hines was awarded an honorary degree at the University of Loughborough in July 2009 and an Honorary Doctorate (Doctor of Letters) at the University of Sheffield on 14 January 2010. In 2008, his personal archive was donated to the University, where it is now part of the Library Special Collections. Upon his death, he received tributes from literary and political figures. Tony Parsons described him as \\"inspirational\\" and Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis described him as \\"a brilliant writer\\". Ken Loach wrote \\"he loved language and his ear for dialect and its comedy was pitch perfect.\\"  Personal life  Hines married twice, and is survived by two children from his first marriage. After spending much of his later life in Sheffield, he returned to a care home in his home village of Hoyland Common after a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. He died on 18 March 2016 at the age of 76.

He studied Botany and History in his youth; the influence of those subjects is detected in his later work in the field of applied arts. As a teacher, Hermann Obrist exerted a seminal influence on the rise and subsequent development of Jugendstil in Germany. Biography Hermann Obrist was the son of Doctor Carl Kaspar Obrist, of Zurich, and Alice Jane Grant Duff, sister of the British politician and statesman Mountstuart Grant Duff. He studied natural sciences and medicine in Heidelberg, and made several trips during which he had visions that determined his artistic vocation. After deciding in 1887 to follow this path, he enrolled at the School of Applied Arts in Karlsruhe to study art techniques. He received an award for his ceramics and furniture at the Paris Exposition of 1889. In 1890, he entered the sculpture class at the Académie Julian in Paris. The following year, he moved to Berlin where he earned his living mainly as a journalist for the cultural pages. In 1892, the sale of a fountain model gave him the means to move to Florence where he opened with Berthe Ruchet, an embroidery workshop, which he moved to Munich in 1895. Its ornamental embroideries and sculptures experienced growing success in Germany. In 1902 Obrist and Wilhelm von Debschitz co-founded a design school in Munich, where his students included Ludwig Hirschfeld Mack, who also studied at the Bauhaus.(fr) Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse, Herman He then engaged in an intense activity as author and speaker and spoke of relations with other artists such as Wassily Kandinsky. Obrist commissioned his friend August Endell to design his studio in Munich, built in 1897 and destroyed in 1944, during World War II. Obrist's works included fountains and funerary monuments. He often used concrete for his works. In addition to being a sculptor he was also a textile artist. Obrist's most famous and influential work was the design for an 1892 embroidered wall hanging called \\"Cyclamen\\". It featured a series of elegant, looping curves of cyclamen flowers, described as whiplash curves, or Peitschenhieb in German, and became a seminal work of the Art Nouveau movement.

However, others view unchecked data and lack of peer-review as a tool of political corruption leading to the imposition of arbitrary and capricious regulations. Information Quality Act as basis for law suits The Competitive Enterprise Institute filed a lawsuit to prevent dissemination of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s \\"Climate Action Report 2002\\" published May 2002, claiming the research did not meet requirements of the Federal Data Quality Act (FDQA), which came into effect in October 2002. The case was dismissed in November 2003. In 2004 the Salt Institute (a salt-producers' association) and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Department of Health and Human Services in federal court using the Data Quality Act. The suit alleged that federal scientists lacked evidence that salt was harmful to health. Although the case was dismissed, the Salt Institute appealed the decision. The Journal of the American Dietetic Association and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) which is part of the US National Institutes of Health claimed that the food industry is adding too much salt to foods.

The sect was started at the Lutheran synod of Stuttgart, 19 December 1559, by Johannes Brenz (1499–1570), a Swabian. Its profession, made under the name of Duke Christopher of Württemberg and entitled the \\"Württemberg Confession,\\" was sent to the Council of Trent in 1552, but had not been formally accepted as the Ubiquitarian creed until the synod at Stuttgart. Setting Luther had upset the peace of Germany by his disputes. In the effort to reconcile and unite the contending forces against the Turks, Charles V demanded of the Lutherans a written statement of their doctrines. This--the \\"Augsburg Confession\\"--was composed by Philip Melanchthon, and read at a meeting at Augsburg in 1530. Its tenth article concerned the Real Presence of Christ in the Blessed Sacrament, a burning question among the Protestants. In 1540, Melanchthon published another version of the \\"Augsburg Confession\\", in which the article on the Real Presence differed essentially from what had been expressed in 1530. The wording was as follows: *Edition of 1530: \\"Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that the body and blood of Christ are truly present, and are distributed (communicated) to those that eat in the Lord's Supper; and they disapprove of those that teach otherwise.\\" *Edition of 1540: \\"Concerning the Lord's Supper, they teach that with bread and wine are truly exhibited the body and blood of Christ to those that eat in the Lord's Supper.\\" Johann Eck, in a conference at Worms, 1541, was the first to call attention to the change. Debates followed, and the Ubiquitarian controversy arose, the question being: Is the body of Christ in the Eucharist, and if so, why? The Confession of 1540 was known as the Reformed doctrine. To this, Melanchthon, with his adherents, subscribed and maintained that Christ's body was not in the Eucharist. They maintained this because the Eucharist exists in multiple locations at once, and it is impossible, they contended, for a body to be in many places simultaneously. Adopting Martin Luther's interpretation of the communicatio idiomatum, Brenz argued that the attributes of the Divine Nature had been communicated to the humanity of Christ which thus was deified. If deified, it was everywhere, ubiquitous, just as His divinity, and therefore really present in the Eucharist. This teaching of Brenz was in partial agreement with the Catholic faith--as to the fact, but not as to the explanation. His assertion that Christ's human nature had been deified, and that His body was in the Eucharist as it was elsewhere, contradicted Catholic teaching and was considered heretical. Later events In 1583, Martin Chemnitz, who had unconsciously been defending the Catholic doctrine, calmed the discussion by his adhesion to absolute Ubiquitarianism. This doctrine appeared again in 1616 under the names of Kenoticism and Crypticism, but sank into oblivion in the troubles of the Thirty Years' War.

Ontario Teachers' also invests the plan's pension fund, and is one of the world’s largest institutional investors. The plan is a multi-employer pension plan, jointly sponsored by the Government of Ontario and the Ontario Teachers' Federation. History Ontario Teachers' was established on Jan. 1, 1990. Until then, Ontario teachers' pensions had been sponsored solely by the Ontario government. Assets of the plan had been invested in government bonds only. Organization The plan administers the pensions for some 184,000 teachers, principals, and school administrators, and pays pensions to some 145,000 retirees. In 2019, $6.4 billion in benefits was paid to members. Ontario Teachers' is headquartered in Toronto, with operations in London, Hong Kong and an office in New York. Effective January 1, 2020, Jo Taylor succeeded Ron Mock as President and Chief Executive Officer. The Chair of the Board is Steve McGirr. Investments Ontario Teachers' is one of Canada's largest institutional investors having reported $207.4 billion in net assets on December 31, 2019. It has an excellent track record for investment performance with an average annual return of 9.7% since inception. Ontario Teachers' owns and manages a diversified portfolio of Canadian and international assets. Through its fully owned real estate subsidiary Cadillac Fairview, Ontario Teachers' owns properties that include the Toronto-Dominion Centre, Toronto Eaton Centre, and the Rideau Centre in Ottawa. Through its private equity investment arm Private Capital, Ontario Teachers' owns or has had interests in companies such as Munchkin, Plano and Shearer's Foods. Ontario Teachers' owns a substantial portfolio of infrastructure assets including: 100% of Bristol Airport and minority stakes in Birmingham Airport, Copenhagen Airport, Brussels Airport and London City Airport; the High Speed 1 rail line linking London with the Channel Tunnel; and international water and power utilities. Ontario Teachers' also owns Camelot Group PLC, which holds an exclusive licence to operate the U.K. National Lottery. It has acquired a share of the Irish National Lottery in 2014. From 2003 to 2012, the fund was the principal owner of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment, the parent organization of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, Toronto FC and Toronto Argonauts. In 2017, it acquired Mémora Servicios Funerarias, a Spanish funeral provider, from 3i. On September 26, 2018, Ontario Teachers' joined finance, health and government leaders in signing the Tobacco-Free Finance Pledge (of the NGO Tobacco-Free Portfolios), which commits the pension plan to no longer invest in tobacco companies. In 2019, Ontario Teachers', along with Amazon and others, assisted in financing to help the New York Yankees regain ownership control of their regional sports network the YES Network, resulting in a minority ownership in the network. Ontario Teachers' posts a list of major investments annually on its website.  Media coverage  On the January 12, 2004 episode of Rick Mercer Report, comedian Rick Mercer had a short segment about the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, in which he humorously contrasted the plan's beneficiaries (i.e. teachers) with the investments the plan had made, including shopping malls and the tobacco industry. On December 2, 2008, New York lawyer Marc Stuart Dreier was arrested at Ontario Teachers' Toronto offices and charged with impersonating, through his words and by the use of business cards, Michael Padfield, a senior lawyer with the pension plan. A receptionist in the Ontario Teachers' offices had become suspicious and notified Toronto police who promptly arrested him. Dreier was attempting to close a sale of forged Ontario Teachers' promissory notes, worth $44.7 million USD, by meeting with the buyers right in the Ontario Teachers' offices. On December 4, 2008, Dreier was indicted by the United States Justice Department for successfully executing a similar corporate officer 'impersonation' routine, including bluffing his way into using the momentarily vacant CEO's office of one 'selling' firm for a meeting with the buyer, to sell forged financial instruments on at least two occasions in New York.

In the suit it was alleged that she illegally shared six songs over KaZaA file- sharing network. The suit was eventually dismissed in 2007 with prejudice by a federal judge. The RIAA later sued two of Ms. Santangelo's children. A default judgment was entered against one of them, Michelle Santangelo. Ms. Santangelo's 16-year-old son Robert Santangelo has interposed counterclaims against the plaintiffs, including \\"failure to warn\\". Background The suit against Patricia Santangelo was filed by Elektra Entertainment Group as one of approximately 13,000 lawsuits that the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has brought against individual defendants in the U.S before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. It alleged that Patricia (Patti) Santangelo, a single mother of five based in Wappingers Falls, New York, infringed the copyright of several companies by sharing six songs on the KaZaA file-sharing network. Elektra offered to settle the case for $7,500, but Mrs. Santangelo rejected the offer. She says that she didn't realize that her computer contained KaZaA software, and that the KaZaA account name listed in the suit had never been used by anyone in her family; the name was said to be \\"similar\\" to the screen name of a teenage friend of one of her children.http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051223/NEWS02/512230330/1018 One frequently cited criticism of the RIAA's lawsuits is that they use an assembly line approach to lawsuits, trying to get the same result in every case no matter the evidence, trying to carry out the lawsuits and settlements in the most efficient way, and acting as if lawsuits are a standard part of business. This case is somewhat notable because the judge, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, appears to agree with some of those criticisms in a dialog with Mike Maschio, an RIAA attorney: Mrs. Santangelo originally appeared in court without a lawyer. She was later represented by Ray Beckerman of Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP.Beldock Levine & Hoffman LLP, Entertainment  Civil Rights  Criminal Defense Attorneys For a brief period she appeared pro se again, and since then has been represented by Jordan Glass of Valhalla, New York. Her former lawyer Beckerman commented \\"I'm sure she's going to win. I don't see how they could win. They have no case. They have no evidence she ever did anything.\\"iWon During the proceedings for their Motion to Dismiss, after the oral argument of the motion, the RIAA's lawyers asked for a second oral argument. According to Ray Beckerman this was unusual: > I would say that asking for a second oral argument is unusual, because (a) > in almost 31 years of working in litigation I’ve never heard of anyone doing > it, and (b) the very asking for it is an admission that the first oral > argument was lost. p2pnet.net, whose readers raised a total of more than $15,000 to help Mrs Santangelo with her legal expenses, ran an interview with her in 2005. In it, she declared, > Don’t let your fear of these massive companies allow you to deny your belief > in your own innocence. Paying these settlements is an admission of guilt. If > you’re not guilty of violating the law, don’t pay. RIAA Response The RIAA contends that illegally shared files were found on a computer with an IP address connected to Ms. Santangelo, and that this is sufficient grounds for continuing to pursue the lawsuit. In a CNN American Morning interview, Miles O'Brien discussed the case with Ms. Santangelo and RIAA President Cary Sherman.RIAA v. Computer Illiterate Mother of Five The following excerpts from a transcript of the interview summarize the RIAA's position: Case details A motion to dismiss has been filed, stating that \\"the Courts have consistently required specific acts of copying, and the dates and times of those acts\\", and the complainant isn't providing those. The plaintiff's response is that the specific files were listed, and that specific times of violations aren't needed, because there is \\"an ongoing and continuous infringement\\". This is in conflict with Mrs. Santangelo's statements on the record that the computer's disk has been reformatted because of \\"a lot of major viruses\\", and that her ex-husband is now in possession of the computer. RIAA then made the unusual request to have a second oral argument session and to submit an additional surreply. The motion to dismiss the case was denied on 28 November 2005. Then Elektra sought to dismiss the case \\"without prejudice\\" but the Court denied the motion, saying that the RIAA could either dismiss the case with prejudice or proceed to trial. On April 9, 2007, a stipulation of discontinuance with prejudice was entered. Three days later the case was dismmised by a federal judge with prejudice, which means that Santangelo was the prevailing party and therefore eligible to file a motion to recover attorneys' fees.Defendant prevails in another RIAA file-sharing case Elektra proceeded to file suits against Santangelo's son and daughter (Robert and Michelle) based on evidence obtained during the original proceedings. According to legal documents Michelle Santagelo did not respond to this case and a default judgment of $30,750 was approved in favor of Elektra/RIAA. Robert, however, has not settled. He is also represented by Jordan Glass and is raising 32 defenses including arguments that he didn't send copyrighted files to others, the recording companies originally promoted file sharing, the statute of limitations had passed, and that all of the music on his computer had been owned on CD by his sister. He is counter-suing the record companies for violating antitrust laws, conspiring to defraud the courts, and making extortionate threats.1010 WINS - On-Air, Online, On Demand - * See also *RIAA, File-sharing controversy *File sharing *David Zamos -- another case where an individual was expected to quickly settle, but instead contested the claims, and subsequently gained substantial support from the press References External links and sources *RIAALawsuits.us - Documents from the case *MTV News - Single Mother Of Five Takes On RIAA In Downloading Case *Corante Copyfight weblog - an interview with Ray Beckerman *Interview with the RIAA Mom - Sept 6, 2005 MP3 Newswire article *Mom Fights RIAA Suit Solo *News report compilation, including RIAA President's response: WMV format Google Video Category:Recording Industry Association of America Category:United States District Court for the Southern District of New York cases Category:United States copyright case law Category:United States Internet case law Category:2005 in United States case law ","title":"Elektra v.

The archaeological evidence does suggest that he was indeed Shoshenq C's son. However, recent published studies by the German Egyptologist Karl Jansen- Winkeln in JEA 81 (1995) have demonstrated that all the monuments of the first (king) Harsiese show that he was never a High Priest of Amun in his own right. Rather both Harsiese A and his son [...du] – whose existence is known from inscriptions on the latter's funerary objects at Coptos – are only attested as Ordinary Priests of Amun. Instead, while Harsiese A was certainly an independent king at Thebes during the first decade of Osorkon II's kingship, he was a different person from a second person who was also called Harsiese: Harsiese B. Harsiese B was the genuine High Priest of Amun, who is attested in office late in Osorkon II's reign, in the regnal year 6 of Shoshenq III and in regnal years 18 and 19 of Pedubast I, according to Jansen-Winkeln. While Harsiese A may have become king at Thebes prior to Year 4 of Osorkon II, contra Kitchen, he certainly ruled Thebes during the first decade of Osorkon II's reign as Kitchen notes. Osorkon II's control over this great city is only first documented by two separate Year 12 Nile Level Texts, which means that Harsiese had died by this time. If Harsiese was already ruling at Thebes earlier under Takelot I, it might help explain why Takelot I's own Year 5, Year 8, and Year 14 Nile Level Texts, which mention the serving High Priests Iuwelot and Smendes III—who were all brothers of Takelot I--consistently omit any mention of Takelot's name, as Gerard Broekman aptly notes in an article in JEA (88 (2002)). Takelot I's name is left deliberately blank here. This might indicate a possible rivalry between Takelot I and Harsiese A at Thebes. The Amun Priests may have chosen not to involve themselves in this dispute by omitting any mention of the reigning king's name. Burial According to a 1994 book by the English Egyptologist Aidan Dodson, King Harsiese: Dodson notes that Harsiese's coffin is similar in style to the hawk-headed silver coffin of Shoshenq II, and to the surviving \\"traces of the gilded coffin and cartonnage of Osorkon II\\" (pp. 88–89).

She was sunk while returning from the second mission. Type B submarines This was the most numerous class of Japanese submarines – almost 20 were built, of which only one () survived. These boats were fast, had a long range, and carried a seaplane, launched via a forward catapult. The keel of I-29 was laid on 29 September 1940 at the Yokosuka Naval Yard, and she was commissioned on 27 February 1942, into the 14th submarine squadron under the command of Lieutenant Commander (later Captain) Izu Juichi (伊豆壽市). Yanagi missions Yanagi missions were enabled under the Axis Powers' Tripartite Pact to provide for an exchange of personnel, strategic materials and manufactured goods between Germany, Italy and Japan. Initially, cargo ships made the exchanges, but when that was no longer possible submarines were used. Only five other submarines attempted this trans-oceanic voyage during World War II: (April 1942), (June 1943), (October 1943) and the German submarines (August 1943) and (May 1945). Of these, I-30 was sunk by a mine and I-34 by the British submarine . Later, the famous Japanese submarine would also share their fate. In 1945 the German U-234 had completed part of the voyage to Japan when news of Germany's surrender to the Allies was announced, and the submarine subsequently was intercepted and boarded off Newfoundland; this marked the end of the German-Japanese submarine exchanges. Service history =Missions= I-29 participated in missions supporting the attack on Port Moresby in New Guinea (Operation Mo), and also in the futile search for Task Force 16, that launched the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo in April 1942. I-29s reconnaissance of Sydney harbour on 23 May 1942 resulted in the Japanese midget submarine attack on Sydney Harbour. =First exchange= Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Second left, first line and his Adjutant, Abid Hasan far left with the Crewmembers of I-29 after the exchange with U-180 (April 18, 1943) In April 1943, I-29 was tasked with a Yanagi mission. She was commanded by Captain Masao Teraoka, submarine flotilla commander – indicating the importance of the trip. She left Penang with a cargo that included two tons of gold. She met Fregattenkapitän Werner Musenberg's Type IXD-1 U-boat, on 26 April 1943 off the coast of Mozambique. During this meeting that lasted over 12 hours due to bad weather, the two Axis submarines swapped several important passengers. U-180 transferred Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, a leader of the Indian Independence Movement who was going from Berlin to Tokyo, and his adjutant, Abid Hasan. I-29 in turn transferred two Japanese Navy personnel who were to study U-boat building techniques in Germany: Commander (later posthumously promoted to rear admiral) Emi Tetsushiro, and Lieutenant Commander (later posthumously promoted to captain) Tomonaga Hideo (who was later connected with the German submarine U-234). Both submarines returned safely to their bases. I-29 landed her important passengers at Sabang on Weh Island, located to the north of Sumatra on 6 May 1943, instead of the Penang, to avoid detection by British spies. Bose and Hasan's transfer is the only known record of a civilian transfer between two submarines of two different navies in World War II. Also there were exchange of two tonnes of gold ingots as payment from Japan for weapons technology. =Second exchange= On December 17, 1943, I-29 was dispatched on a second Yanagi mission, this time to Lorient, France, under star Japanese submarine Commander Takakazu Kinashi. At Singapore she was loaded with 80 tons of raw rubber, 80 tons of tungsten, 50 tons of tin, two tons of zinc, and three tons of quinine, opium and coffee. In spite of Allied Ultra decrypts of her mission, I-29 managed to reach Lorient 11 March 1944. On her way she was refueled twice by German vessels. Also, she had three close brushes with Allied aircraft tracking her signals. Of special note is the attack of six RAF aircraft including two Mosquito F Mk. XVIII fighters equipped with 57 mm cannon from No. 248 Squadron RAF off Cape Peñas, Bay of Biscay, at , and the protection provided to her during the entry into Lorient by the Luftwaffe's only Long Range Maritime Fighter Unit, V Gruppe/Kampfgeschwader 40 using Ju 88s. At least one Ju 88 was shot down by British fighters over Spanish waters. The Kriegsmarine also provide an escort of two destroyers and two torpedo boats.Goss 1997, pp. 153–154 She left Lorient 16 April 1944 for the long voyage home with a cargo of 18 passengers, torpedo boat engines, Enigma coding machines, radar components, a Walter HWK 509A rocket engine, and Messerschmitt Me 163 & Messerschmitt Me 262 blueprints for the development of the rocket plane Mitsubishi J8M. After an uneventful trip she arrived at Singapore on 14 July 1944, disembarking her passengers, though not the cargo. =Sinking= On her way back to Kure, Japan, she was attacked at Balintang Channel, Luzon Strait, near the Philippines by Commander W. D. Wilkins' \\"Wildcats\\" submarine task force consisting of , and , using Ultra signal intelligence. During the evening of 26 July 1944, she was spotted by Sawfish which fired four torpedoes at her. Three hit I-29, which sank immediately at . Only one of her crewmen survived. Among the dead was I-29s commanding officer, Commander Takakazu Kinashi, Japan's highest-scoring submarine \\"ace\\". Earlier in the war, as skipper of , Kinashi torpedoed and sank the U.S. aircraft carrier and damaged both the battleship and the destroyer during the same attack. O'Brien later sank as a result of the torpedo damage and North Carolina was under repair at Pearl Harbor until November 16, 1942, Kinashi was honored by a rare two-rank posthumous promotion to rear admiral. Media * I-29 is the submarine shown in the 2004 Bollywood film Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose: The Forgotten Hero where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose travels with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he is transferred to the I-29, greeted aboard by her captain Masao Teraoka and continues the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan.

Life Uhtred joined the Benedictine community of Durham Abbey about 1332 and was sent to London in 1337. Three years later he entered Durham College, Oxford, a house which the Durham Benedictines had established at Oxford for those of their members who pursued their studies at the University of Oxford. He was graduated there as licentiate in 1352 and as doctor in 1357. During the succeeding ten years, and even previously, he took part in numerous disputations at Oxford University, many of which were directed against members of the mendicant orders. It is on this account that John Bale wrongly designates him as a supporter of John Wycliffe. In 1367 Uhtred became prior of Finchale Abbey, a position to which he was appointed three other times, in 1379, 1386, and 1392. In 1368 and in 1381 he served as subprior at Durham Abbey. Along with Wycliffe he was one of the delegates sent by King Edward III to the papal representatives at Bruges in 1374, with the purpose of reaching an agreement concerning the vexed question of canonical provision in England. In the same year he represented Durham Abbey at a council held by Edward, Prince of Wales, for the purpose of determining whether the king was obliged to recognize the papal suzerainty which had been granted to Innocent III by King John. On this occasion Uhtred defended the pope's right of overlordship, but, when on the following day the assembly cast its vote contrarily, he followed their example. Works Uhtred's writings included: *De substantialibus regulae monachalis, preserved in the Durham Cathedral Library; *Contra querelas Fratrum, written about 1390, extant in the British Library; and *a Latin translation of the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius, also preserved in the British Library.

He was the twenty- ninth (29th) Kabaka of Buganda. Claim to the throne He was born at Bujuuko Hill around 1820. He was the son of Kabaka Kamaanya Kadduwamala, Kabaka of Buganda, who reigned between 1814 and 1832. His mother was Nakkazi Kannyange, the twenty-third (23rd) of his father's thirty-eight (38) wives.

Kampala: East African Literature Bureau, 1967 He established his capital on Mulago Hill. Married life Kabaka Suuna II continued in the tradition started by his grandfather and copied by his father; the practice of marrying an extraordinary number of wives. Ssuuna II outdid all of them. He is reported to have married one hundred forty eight wives. Issue As expected, the Kabaka having married 148 wives, he fathered a large number of children.

He was a handsome boy, taking after the looks of his mother, Nakkazi Kannyange, reportedly one of the most beautiful women in Buganda at the time. He began as a popular monarch, loved by his people. However, as he grew more confident, he became cocky and ruthless. He gave himself a string of names that implied invincibility and super-normal powers. He ordered the execution of fifty eight (58) of his sixty brothers. Only two (2) escaped the carnage: * Prince (Omulangira) Wasajja, whose mother was Nakkazi of the Mamba clan (not Nakkazi Kannyange) * Prince (Omulangira) Mugogo, whose mother was Kyotowadde of the Mamba clan By the time of his death Kabaka Ssuuna II turned out to be one of the most ruthless of the Buganda kings. During his reign, the neglect of sanitary standards within the capital was decreed an offence punishable by death. Suna put a number of persons to death for breach of his rules, which aroused the ire of a certain medium named Kigemuzi. Kigemuzi began to speak disrespectfully of the King, saying that he did so by order of the gods. On Suna's orders, Kigemuzi was arrested and taken to the capital, contrary to the custom. He protested before the Kabaka, reminding him it was contrary to custom to bind a medicine-man or a medium. The King then ordered Kigemuzi to be removed, and that night the royal house was struck by lightning, and the King was scorched on his face and on one side of his body. Suna at once sent for the medium Kigemuzi, released him, and asked him why there had been this storm. The medium answered: \\"Because the god of thunder (Kiwanuka) is angry at what you have done to me.\\" The King then presented the man with cattle to make atonement for binding him, and the King's mother settled him on a large tract of land, in order to propitiate the gods, and to save her son from further harm.J. Roscoe, The Baganda, 1911, pp.227. The final years In his final years, Kabaka Ssuuna sent an emissary to the king of Buzongola. On his return, the emissary delivered a less than flattering message from Buzongola. Ssuna took this as a slight and waged war against the kingdom of Buzongola. The Katikiro, Kayira, the Kabaka's great chiefs and the Queen mother all advised against embarking on a military campaign in a time of famine and small pox. The Kabaka proceeded with the ill advised war.Mukasa, H. (1934). \\"Some Notes on the Reign of Mutesa.\\" Uganda Journal, 2(1), 124-133 Despite emerging victorious and driving out the king of Buzongola, the combined effects of war, small pox and famine greatly weakened his armies and most of his men died before reaching Buganda. Kabaka Ssuuna II died of small pox on his way back to Buganda in October 1856. Kayira brought his remains back to Nabulagala. His remains are currently buried at Wamala. Quotes \\"He was a very cruel man: he was brave in war, he was a hunter of wild animals and very fond of hunting dogs. At times, however, he was kind, so they say, and it is well known that cruel kings at times exercise kindness so that they shall not be hated by their subjects. Such was Suna.\\" * Ham Mukasa, \\"Some Notes on the Reign of Mutesa\\", 1934Mukasa, H. (1934). \\"Some Notes on the Reign of Mutesa.\\" Uganda Journal, 2(1), 124-133 Wamala Tombs Set on a hilltop with beautiful surroundings, Wamala is the sacred burial place of Kabaka Ssuuna II, who had 148 wives and 218 children. Suuna II was the last Kabaka to be buried in his own palace and the last to have his jaw bone removed after death. He was also the first Kabaka to admit outside traders into Buganda. A magical but almost forgotten place, Wamala Tombs is quite unique. It is a thirty-minute drive from Kampala along Kampala-Hoima Road. It is located on a hilltop about after the right turn, off Hoima Road.

Early life Ware was born Herta Schwartz in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Helen Ware, a musician and violin teacher, and Lazlo Schwartz, an actor who was born in Budapest. Her mother's brother was activist Harold Ware and her maternal grandmother was labor organizer and socialist Ella Reeve Bloor. Her father was Jewish and her mother was Christian. Career Ware made her Broadway debut in Let Freedom Ring (November 6, 1935–February 1936), co-starring husband Will Geer, whom she had married in 1934. The couple appeared together in other New York plays, including Bury the Dead (1936), Prelude (1936), 200 Were Chosen (1936) and Journeyman (1938), and Six O'Clock Theatre (1948), all of which were short-lived. She made her on-screen debut in 1978, when she appeared in the television film, A Question of Guilt. Subsequently, she appeared in her first feature film 1980, The Black Marble. Her second feature film was Dr. Heckyl and Mr. Hype, which featured Oliver Reed. She starred in 2010 in 1984. She is perhaps most recognized for her performance in the classic film Ron Howard's Cocoon, and appeared in the sequel Cocoon: The Return. She appeared in Critters 2: The Main Course as \\"Nana\\". She had roles in several other well-known films such as, Species, Practical Magic, with Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, and Cruel Intentions, with Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillippe. Her role in the 1992 television film Crazy in Love earned her a CableACE Award for Supporting Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. Ware has made many guest appearances on classic television series including, Knots Landing, Highway to Heaven, Cagney & Lacey, The Golden Girls and ER, to name a few. She and her daughter, Ellen both made guest appearances on Star Trek: The Next Generation and Beauty and the Beast. Personal life In 1934, Ware married actor Will Geer, with whom she had three children. She and Geer were politically-minded and relocated to Los Angeles in the early 1940s and settled in Santa Monica so that Geer could pursue his movie career. In 1951, the passionately left-wing Geer became blacklisted by Hollywood for taking the Fifth Amendment and refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. With Geer's film career destroyed, and falling into financial difficulties, the couple lost their Los Angeles home. The pair divorced in 1954 but remained close friends. Ware later married actor David Marshall, with whom she had one child, a daughter, actress Melora Marshall. They later divorced. Ware and Geer reunited in 1973 and subsequently co-founded the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, which was on five acres of land that Ware purchased in Topanga Canyon for $10,000. The burgeoning theater officially opened as a summer theater in 1973. She stayed by Geer's bedside as he died of a respiratory ailment in 1978. In 2000, Ware published her own memoir Fantastic Journey, My Life with Will Geer. Death Ware died on August 15, 2005, due to complications of Parkinson's disease, aged 88, in Topanga, California. Her ashes and those of her husband, Will Geer, were scattered at their outdoor theatre.

He is currently Professor of Philosophy & Church-State Studies, and Associate Director of the Graduate Program in Philosophy, at Baylor University, where he first served as Associate Director of Baylor's J. M. Dawson Institute of Church-State Studies.https://www.baylorisr.org/scholars/b/francis-beckwith/ Beckwith works in the areas of ethics, legal and political philosophy, philosophy of religion, and church-state jurisprudence. Beckwith is well known for his legal and philosophical work on abortion, arguing the anti-abortion position in several academic publications including his 2007 book Defending Life, published by Cambridge University Press, and his 1993 book, Politically Correct Death, published by Baker Publishing Group. He has also published multiple books examining current philosophical questions regarding religion, law and politics. His 2015 book, Taking Rites Seriously: Law, Politics and the Reasonableness of Faith, (Cambridge University Press), was the winner of the prestigious American Academy of Religion's 2016 Book Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion in the category of Constructive-Reflective Studies.https://www.aarweb.org/about/2016-aar-book-awards-announced. In May 2007, he returned to the Catholicism of his youth, after decades as an Evangelical Protestant. This inspired him to write a book describing his faith journey, titled Return to Rome: Confessions of an Evangelical Catholic published by Brazos Press. It is compared with Scott Hahn's Rome Sweet Home, as a significant work of Catholic Apologetics.  Life, education and academic appointments  Beckwith was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States and grew up in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is a graduate of Bishop Gorman High School, where he was a member of the 1978 AAA Basketball high school state championship team. His siblings include the writer, comic, and actress Elizabeth Beckwith. After graduating with his B.A. in philosophy from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), he went on to earn degrees from Simon Greenleaf School of Law, Anaheim (M.A. in apologetics), Fordham University (PhD. and M.A. in philosophy), and the Washington University School of Law, St. Louis (Master of Juridical Studies). A condensed version of Beckwith's 1984 M.A. thesis on the Baháʼí Faith was published by Bethany House, as Baha'i: A Christian Response in 1985. In 2001, Beckwith completed his Wash. U. M.J.S dissertation on the inclusion of intelligent design in public school science curricula. Under the mentorship of philosopher of law Stanley Paulsen, Roman and Littlefield published this in revised and expanded form in 2003 as Law, Darwinism, and Public Education: The Establishment Clause and the Challenge of Intelligent Design. Prior to arriving at Baylor in July 2003, he was a Visiting Research Fellow (2002–2003) in the James Madison Program in the Politics Department at Princeton University. He has also held full-time academic appointments at UNLV (Lecturer in Philosophy, 1989–96), Whittier College (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, 1996–97), and Trinity International University (Associate Professor Philosophy, Culture, and Law, 1997-2002). Beckwith has also held two visiting endowed appointments: (2008-2009) Mary Anne Remick Senior Visiting Fellow in the de Nicola Center for Ethics & Culture at the University of Notre Dame, and (2016–2017) Visiting Scholar in Conservative Thought and Policy in the Benson Center for Western Civilization, Thought, and Policy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. In November 2006, Beckwith became the 58th president of the Evangelical Theological Society (ETS), only to resign both his presidency and membership in May 2007, a week after he returned to the Catholic Church. Over a decade later, he became the 90th president of the American Catholic Philosophical Association (ACPA). As of late 2007, he is a fellow at The Center for Bioethics & Human Dignity (CBHD) Prior to his appointment, Beckwith had co- authored with Gregory Koukl, Feet Firmly Planted in Midair, published in 1998 by Baker Books,https://www.amazon.ca/Relativism-Feet-Firmly-Planted-Mid- Air/dp/0801058066 addressing common arguments defending relativism. In the aforementioned, Politically Correct Death, he discusses abortion, compiling an effective philosophically sound prolife position. In 2003, after his appointment as associate director of the J. M. Dawson Institute of Church- State Studies at Baylor, 29 members of the Dawson family called on Baylor University to remove Beckwith as associate director. The Dawson family members questioned the appointment, accusing Beckwith of holding church-state positions contrary to Dawson's beliefs on the separation of church and state, largely because of Beckwith's affiliation with the Discovery Institute (DI) and his work on intelligent design and public education. Beckwith argued that their concerns were not well founded and that they represented a fundamental misunderstanding of his positions. In summer 2007 Beckwith dropped his affiliation with Discovery. He has subsequently published works highly critical of intelligent design, including chapters in his award-winning 2015 book Taking Rites Seriously' and his 2019 book Never Doubt Thomas: The Catholic Aquinas as Evangelical and Protestant. He currently resides with his wife in Texas.

There is an abundance of wildlife and flora. Many kinds of seabirds can be spotted and regular sightings of grey seals and dolphins are made. History Until the mid-19th century, Tresaith consisted of two dwellings; a thatched cottage and the Ship Inn. Shipowners, the Parry family, ran the inn. Their first vessel, the New Hope, was built on the beach in 1827. Later, several smacks of about 25 tons operated from Tresaith, bringing in coal, limestone and culm. In the last few decades of the 19th- century the village became popular as a seaside holiday destination and contemporary newspapers referred to it as the Second Brighton.Jenkins, J. Geraint.

The band had spent time touring after their debut album Tons of Sobs the previous year, and there is a marked difference in the musicianship of the band as well as Paul Rodgers's voice. Whereas Tons of Sobs had been produced by Guy Stevens, Free was produced by the head of Island Records, Chris Blackwell. Recording This album saw the burgeoning of the songwriting partnership between Paul Rodgers and bassist Andy Fraser, which had been glimpsed on Tons of Sobs with songs such as \\"I'm a Mover\\"; here, eight out of the nine tracks bear a Fraser/Rodgers credit. Possibly as a result of the sixteen-year-old Fraser's influence as a songwriter the bass guitar is far more prominent here than on the previous album. The instrument is used as a rhythm guitar, driving the songs, while Kossoff's lead guitar develops from it. While Fraser and Rodgers made a strong writing partnership, tensions in the band increased. Kossoff, whose natural spontaneity had been given free rein up to then, particularly resented being taught very specific rhythm guitar parts by Fraser. However, Blackwell managed to keep the band in line to record the album. The album performed poorly on release, reaching only No.22 in the UK charts, and failing completely in the US. The single releases, \\"Broad Daylight\\" and \\"I'll be Creepin'\\", also failed. Two songs from the album, \\"I'll be Creepin'\\" and \\"Woman\\", were later covered by the American rock band Three Dog Night. Cover The album is notable for having innovative artwork from Ron Raffaelli of The Visual Thing Inc. It is featured in the book 100 Best Album Covers alongside better-known examples such as Peter Blake's cover for the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967) and Robert Crumb's artwork for Big Brother and the Holding Company's Cheap Thrills (1968). The book was part compiled by Storm Thorgerson who had designed many famous album covers such as Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973). Raffaelli made the cover by photographing his model with strobe lights to make a silhouette of her against a background, on which he could then overlay the design. Hence, the album has a design of a woman made of stars leaping across the sky. The band's name is printed in extremely small letters at the top of the cover; with CDs being much smaller than LPs, this is almost unreadable.

Set in the future, the player controls an amnesiac cyborg trying to escape the research facility in which they are being held prisoner. BioForge was developed as an interactive movie making use of motion capture, voice acting, and multiple camera angles. BioForge received mixed reviews. Work was started on a sequel for the game, which was then re-scoped as an expansion pack, and ultimately cancelled. BioForge was re-released on GOG.com in 2012. Story =Setting= Writer Jack Herman created a fictional universe as the setting for BioForge. The backstory is revealed in-game by reading the diaries of various non-player characters. In the distant future, a group of scientists called the Mondites are attempting to overthrow the intergalactic government known as the Reticulum. The Mondites are conducting experiments in genetics and cybernetics in the hopes blending man and machine into assassins for their plans. Years before the game takes place, the Modites intercept a distress call from a Reticulum spacecraft that self-destructed after encountering and reviving an alien lifeform which went on a hostile rampage. Through studying the black box and the remains, they discover the aliens' home world, a moon in a remote sector of the galaxy which they name Daedalus. The Mondites establish a base on Daedalus while investigating the ruins the aliens left behind; a sentient race known as the Phyxx who were long thought to be extinct. The Mondites abduct people and imprison them on Daedalus for their experiments. A mad scientist called Dr. Mastaba is the base commander and head of the \\"ABA Project\\" (Assassin Biologically Augmented). Dr. Mastaba mutilates the bodies of his victims in an attempt to turn them into the ultimate killing machine. Until now, the subjects of Dr. Mastaba's experiments have ended up either dead or insane. Using technology borrowed from the Phyxx, the Mondites have finally succeeded in their experiments. But when one of the aliens is accidentally revived from suspended animation in its tomb, it goes on a rampage through the complex, damaging the reactor and killing half of the base personnel in the process. =Plot= The player takes on the role of a cyborg (Experimental Unit AP-127) who awakens in a cell on Daedalus with no prior memories. After escaping the cell, the protagonist finds themselves one of the few survivors of an incident that has devastated the station. The player must unravel the truth about themselves, the research station, the Mondites that control it, and the mysterious alien race that once inhabited the moon. The game ends after the player escapes Daedalus in an experimental Mondite spacecraft in the wake of the moon's destruction, along with several Phyxx ships. Gameplay An in-game quote showing the dark nature of the game when the player chooses to kill a guard whose life can be spared. BioForge centers mainly on exploration and puzzle solving using items, and also on fighting and interaction with non-player characters (NPCs). The objective of the game is not obvious at the beginning, since the player is unaware of his identity, which depends on his actions during the game. The player has full control over the main character's actions. This was a deliberate idea of Ken Demarest and Jack Herman. Richard Garriott helped kick off the interactive movie theme. In a 1994 magazine article he said that \\"Interactive Movies have become a buzzword, so it's being applied to games which really aren't. Just because a game has FMV that doesn't automatically make it an interactive movie, because you have very little control over the actor. Neither is a game in which you click on an icon, then sit back and watch a scene take place.\\" BioForge has tank controls as in the player character can rotate left and right, walk and run forwards and backwards, and sidestep. The player can also enter a combat stance that makes several punch and kick movements and hand-to-hand weapons (if carried) available. The combat system has been described as being similar to Alone in the Dark. The body of the player character houses an exchangeable (and depletable) battery that powers various body functions put there by the experimenters. Functions include a regeneration system that heals all damage when activated, as well as a powerful projectile weapon (known as the PFD Prototype). Upgrading and swapping the battery is key to the player's progress at certain points in the game. The player can also don a protective armoured suit that enables him to survive the harsh atmosphere outside the facility and explore the archaeological dig. Various objects, such as datalogs or healing packs, can be picked up and stored in the player's inventory. Selected objects are shown carried in the left hand of the player character. Several hand-to- hand and ranged weapons, as well as batteries and other large or one-use objects, can also be picked up during the game, but only one can be carried, using the right hand, and they cannot be stored in the inventory. Much of the game's plot is revealed by finding and reading logs on PDAs and notes left behind by characters, including accounts of experimental subjects losing their memories and lapsing into insanity. As the plot progresses, the main character automatically updates his own diary/log summarizing what he has discovered since the beginning and what has happened for the player to review, an event marked by a sound cue. Lex entering the time-critical reactor chamber puzzle in the protective armoured suit. A large portion of the puzzle element relies on accessing control and computer terminals in order to remotely control robots, open doors and bypass security systems. The puzzles are integrated with the plot, so unfortunately several have a time limit. Development Director Ken Demarest had the core idea for BioForge whilst working as a programmer on Ultima VII: The Black Gate. Demarest felt that Ultima VII had too much freedom, and that creating an interactive movie with synthetic actors would create a more immersive game. BioForge was developed at Origin by a core team of ten people under Demarest, during a period of two years from February 1993 to March 1995. The game was developed using C++ and 80x86 assembly and used the Phar Lap DOS extender. Internally, the game used a custom script language for world management and animation. It also employed an HTML-styled language to code the in-game interface. The working title for the game was Interactive Movie 1. The 3D models of BioForge were created from reference sketches in 3D Studio and then texture-mapped in a proprietary Electronic Arts tool named EOR. The animations were created using the rotoscope technique on live-actor movements captured with the Flock of Birds on-body motion detector system, using an in-house pose editor named System for Animating Lifelike Synthetic Actors (S.A.L.S.A.) that was capable of displaying captured movement as fully rendered models in real time. Origin reportedly paid between $30,000 and $32,000 for the Flock of Birds hardware in order to save time on creating animations. =Technical details= The character's appearance changes according to damage. BioForge uses a software-only 3D engine to draw polygonal objects and characters against pre-rendered backdrops with a fixed resolution of 320x200 pixels in 256 colors. Other technical details also worthy of note are: * As a character gets more and more injured in combat, wounds and blood appear on the model, which will also limp or move awkwardly, indicating its overall health (effects that diminish when the player regains health). * Laser blaster beams deflect intelligently off metal surfaces in scenes, often bouncing multiple times before dissipating. * BioForge pioneered quaternion- based skeletal animation, with pose interpolation and interchangeable skeletons. This would later become a common technique in 3D computer and video games. BioForge can be run reliably in the DOSBox PC emulator as of version 0.65.BioForge on DOSBox =Cancelled expansion pack= A sequel (BioForge II) was designed and the team were working on the art when the project was halted and changed to an expansion pack of the original game, BioForge Plus. BioForge Plus was projected by Origin as an extension to the original game, which would directly continue the plot, but it was cancelled after a rushed beta was completed in 10 weeks. A former Origin employee noted that the company was going through a \\"hard year\\" in 1995 and that job and production team cuts resulted in the cancellation of BioForge Plus. A Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog reported that EA Mythic received a crate full of old Origin Systems archive materials, possibly containing BioForge Plus source code. Reception =Reviews= Reviews for BioForge at its release were mixed. More positive reviews summarized it as \\"a game that combines outstanding atmospherics with decent gameplay\\", and \\"incredibly well-rounded\\". Other reviewers noted problems but considered the game worthwhile, saying \\"While it isn't perfect [...] it would be a mistake to ignore BioForge\\" and \\"flaws aren't enough to keep BioForge from being one of the most unusual and intriguing adventues of the year\\". Edge described it as \\"an enjoyable but ultimately uninvolving experience\\". Elements such as the graphics, attention to detail, and interactivity received praise while the system requirements, combat, and controls drew criticism. The game's graphics were described as \\"first-class\\",, \\"superb\\", and \\"pretty close to top of the line\\".. Next Generation noted that the characters \\"move and fight in a smooth, utterly convincing manner\\". System requirements were mentioned by several reviewers. Electronic Games noted that the game \\"devours more than 30-Meg of hard drive space to deliver a frequently clumsy combination of an RPG and one of the interactive movies which are so en vogue these days.\\" Next Generation said \\"The game has some steep hardware requirements [...] but the payoff is impressive\\". =Awards= PC Gamer US nominated BioForge as its 1995 \\"Best Adventure Game\\", although it lost to Beavis and Butt-Head in Virtual Stupidity. It was the second-place finalist for Computer Game Reviews 1995 \\"Role Playing Game of the Year\\" award, which went to Anvil of Dawn. The editors wrote, \\"[I]n a year that held few RPGs for a starved audience, it had the guts to try role-playing in a sci-fi universe instead of one plagued with magic and dragons.\\" =Legacy= Tim Schafer cited BioForge as an influence on the critically acclaimed 1998 game Grim Fandango in its approach to 3D graphics and use of tank controls. PC Gamer UK ranked BioForge at 88 in its Top 100 PC games in 2001, noting that it \\"pushed boundaries at the time\\". BioForge was included as one of the titles in the 2010 book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die. The Guardian included BioForge in a 2014 list of the \\"greatest video games that time forgot\\" calling it a \\"fascinating example\\" among the \\"nightmarishly unplayable dross\\" of the mid-90s interactive movie genre. In 2013, director Ken Demarest reflected that \\"BioForge was conceived from a technical perspective, and I think that if I’d given as much focus to the gameplay as the underlying technology, it might have enjoyed greater acclaim.\\" References External links * Category:1995 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Cyberpunk video games Category:DOS games Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox Category:Origin Systems games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about amnesia Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in the future Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Windows games ","title":"BioForge"},{"id":"2593299","text":"The Society began as an \\"International Study Group for Research in Cardiac Metabolism\\" in Dubrovnik in 1968; at the 1976 World Congress in Tokyo, it adopted the name \\"International Society for Heart Research\\".

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1899 to 1903, and again from 1907 to 1913. Grain was born in Fergus, Canada West (now Ontario), the son of William Grain, a native of Gibraltar, and Mary Orton, the sister of Dr. G. T. Orton, and attended schools in Fergus and the Toronto School of Medicine. He was assistant surgeon of the 91st battalion in Canada. Grain was one of the charter holders of the Winnipeg and Northern Railway, and served as mayor of Selkirk in 1896. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. He practised medicine in Banff, Alberta, Manitou, Manitoba, Winnipeg and Selkirk. In 1890, Grain married Annie Cull. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1899 provincial election, winning the constituency of Kildonan and St. Andrews as a Liberal- Conservative. He supported the Conservative administration of Hugh John Macdonald and Rodmond Roblin, and sat as a government backbencher in the legislature which followed. Running as a Conservative, he lost to Liberal candidate M.J. O'Donohue by five votes in the 1903 election. Grain defeated O'Donahue by 41 votes in the 1907 election, and again served as a backbench supporter of Roblin's government. He was re-elected in the 1910 election, and resigned from the legislature in 1913. In late 1913, he was named medical inspector for the western provinces for the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs, charged with dealing with the problem of tuberculosis on first nations reserves and, at the same time, with reducing expenses incurred by the department. Grain made a number of suggestions for treating tuberculosis on reserves, but these were rejected for economic reasons. His position in the department was abolished in 1918. In 1914, Grain moved to Winnipeg. He died at home there in 1930.

The show aired twice weekly from 1981 to 1982, with the first episode going to air on 17 June 1981. Series synopsis  Like preceding Crawford's series, the aborted Hotel Story, Holiday Island was a Love Boat- style drama series set in a luxury hotel. This time the location was a tropical resort island in Queensland. In each episode the regular characters - the various islanders and hotel workers - hosted a new batch of guest star hotel guests. Various plots and situations on the show included a fierce cyclone hitting the island, children being kidnapped, a siege where the hotel workers were held hostage by less than pleasant guests, drug trafficking, the resort being terrorised by a biker gang and a politician dying of a heart attack while staying at the island's resort. The series became notorious amongst critics for its allegedly poor production values, and the wintry conditions under which the tropical drama was shot became the focus of most jibes. Though set in a tropical hotel with palm trees, sunshine and beautiful beaches, for practical reasons all interiors scenes - and the bulk of exterior scenes - were shot at the Ten Network's studios in Nunawading, Melbourne. The exterior set made heavy use of awnings in an attempt to disguise Melbourne's propensity for overcast skies, but attempts to mask the icy breath of the bathing beauties was not always successful. Attempts to shoot location footage in Queensland were hampered by the fact that the local television crews assigned to the shoot had experience only in shooting news footage, and the fact that heavy rain fell for several days of a planned shoot. Ray Meagher, a guest star in the show's first episode, later jokingly referred the show as Horror Day on Iceland. Cast  Regular cast: * Nick Tate - Neil Scott * Tom Oliver - Wally Summers * Peter Mochrie - Tony 'Zack' Zackarakis * Alyson Best - Lisa Kendall * Frank Wilson - Banjo Paterson * Patricia Kennedy - Emily Muldoon * Caz Lederman - Angela Scott * Steven Grives - Jason Scott * Gaynor Martin - Kylie McArthur * Marilyn Mayo - Dusty Davis * Brian James - George Tippett Guest cast Ray Meagher Judy Nunn Rowena Wallace Lisa Crittenden Rebecca Gilling Anne Phelan June Salter John Blackman Penne Hackforth-Jones. Cancellation  Holiday Island was cancelled after 64 episodes. The set was later revamped and turned into the Lassiter's Complex featured in the soap opera, Neighbours.

The dilation is often accompanied by a paralysis of the peristaltic movements of the bowel. In more extreme cases, the feces consolidate into hard masses inside the colon, called fecalomas (literally, fecal tumor), which can require surgery to be removed. A human colon is considered abnormally enlarged if it has a diameter greater than 12 cm in the cecum (it is usually less than 9 cm), greater than 6.5 cm in the rectosigmoid region and greater than 8 cm for the ascending colon. The transverse colon is usually less than 6 cm in diameter. A megacolon can be either acute or chronic. It can also be classified according to cause. Signs and symptoms External signs and symptoms are constipation of very long duration, abdominal bloating, abdominal tenderness and tympany, abdominal pain, palpation of hard fecal masses and, in toxic megacolon, fever, low blood potassium, tachycardia and may lead to shock. Stercoral ulcers are sometimes observed in chronic megacolon, which may lead to perforation of the intestinal wall in approximately 3% of the cases, leading to sepsis and risk of death. Cause * Congenital or aganglionic megacolon * Medication * Acquired megacolon, of which there are several possible causes:  Idiopathic megacolon  Toxic megacolon  Megacolon secondary to infection * Clostridium difficile * Trypanosoma Cruzi (Chagas)  Other neurologic, systemic and metabolic diseases =Aganglionic megacolon= Also called Hirschsprung's disease, it is a congenital disorder of the colon in which nerve cells of the myenteric plexus in its walls, also known as ganglion cells, are absent. It is a rare disorder (1:5 000), with prevalence among males being four times that of females. Hirschsprung's disease develops in the fetus during the early stages of pregnancy. A genetic predisposition to Hirschsprung's disease has been linked to chromosome 13 where a missense mutation at an ultraconserved region impairs functionality of the W276C receptor. Seven other genes seem to be implicated, however. If untreated, the patient can develop enterocolitis. =Medication= Risperidone, an anti-psychotic medication, can result in megacolon. =Toxic megacolon= Toxic megacolon is mainly seen in ulcerative colitis and pseudomembranous colitis, two chronic inflammations of the colon (and occasionally, in the other type of inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease). Its mechanism is incompletely understood. It is probably due to an excessive production of nitric oxide, at least in ulcerative colitis. The prevalence is about the same for both sexes. In patients with HIV/AIDS, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis is the leading cause of toxic megacolon and emergency laparotomy. CMV may also increase the risk of toxic megacolon in non-HIV/AIDS patients with IBD. =Chagas disease= Megacolon can be associated with Chagas disease. In Central and South America, the most common incidence of chronic megacolon is that observed in about 20% of patients affected with Chagas disease. Chagas is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, a flagellate protozoan transmitted by the feces of a hematophagous insect, the assassin bug, when it feeds. Chagas can also be acquired congenitally, through blood transfusion or organ transplant, and rarely through contaminated food (for example garapa). There are several theories on how megacolon (and also megaesophagus) develops in Chagas disease. The Austrian-Brazilian physician and pathologist Fritz Köberle was the first to propose the neurogenic hypothesis based on the documented destruction of the myenteric plexus in the walls of the intestinal tracts of Chagas patients. In this, the destruction of the autonomic nervous system innervation of the colon leads to a loss of the normal smooth muscle tone of the wall and subsequent gradual dilation. His research proved that, by extensively quantifying the number of neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the Auerbach's plexus, that: # neurons were strongly reduced all over the digestive tract; # megacolon appeared only when there was a reduction of over 80% of the number of neurons # these pathologies appeared as a result of the disruption of the neurally integrated control of peristalsis (muscular annular contraction) in those parts where a strong force is necessary to impel the luminal bolus of feces # idiopathic megacolon and Chagas megacolon appear to have the same cause, namely the degeneration of the myenteric plexus. Why T. cruzi causes the destruction, however, remains to be determined. There is evidence for the presence of specific neurotoxins as well as a disorderly immune system reaction. Diagnosis Diagnosis is achieved mainly by plain and contrasted radiographical and ultrasound imaging. Colonic marker transit studies are useful to distinguish colonic inertia from functional outlet obstruction causes. In this test, the patient swallows a water-soluble bolus of radiocontrast agent and films are obtained 1, 3, and 5 days later. Patients with colonic inertia show the marker spread throughout the large intestines, while patients with outlet obstruction exhibit slow accumulations of markers in some places. A colonoscopy can also be used to rule out mechanical obstructive causes. Anorectal manometry may help to differentiate acquired from congenital forms. Rectal biopsy is recommended to make a final diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. Treatment Possible treatments include: * Stable cases are effectively treated with laxatives and bulking agents, as well as modifications in diet and stool habits. * Corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications are used in toxic megacolon. * Antibiotics are used for bacterial infections such as oral vancomycin for Clostridium difficile * Disimpaction of feces and decompression using anorectal and nasogastric tubes are used to treat megacolon. * When megacolon worsens and the conservative measures fail to restore transit, surgery may be necessary. * Bethanechol can also be used to treat megacolon by means of its direct cholinergic action and its stimulation of muscarinic receptors which bring about a parasympathetic-like effect. There are several surgical approaches to treat megacolon, such as a colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal anastomosis (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal anastomosis.

Throughout D&D; history, up to and including the third edition Player's Handbook, spellcaster gnomes were either illusionists or had illusionist as their favored class.Cook, David, et al. Monstrous Compendium Volume One (TSR, 1989) However, in Dungeons & Dragons v.3.5, gnomes' favored class has been changed to bard, as the favored class of \\"illusionist\\" was a subset of the wizard class. The wizard favored class was also already used by elves. In D&D; v.3.5, gnomes are inventors and alchemists who love pranks and excel at engineering. The tinker gnomes of Dragonlance are mechanically skilled, though their devices are quite prone to backfiring. It has been suggested that gnomes be given the Eberron class artificer as a favored class, due to their technical aptitude. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= Gnomes appeared in 4th edition as a player character race in Player's Handbook 2 (2009).http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pr/20090202 The gnome appeared in the Monster Manual (2008). =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The gnome was included as a player race in the 5th edition Player's Handbook (2014). Two subraces were introduced with it: the forest gnome and the rock gnome. The Player's Handbook connects the rock gnomes to the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting. The deep gnome (svirfneblin) is also referenced in the Player's Handbook, and is fully detailed in the 5th edition Monster Manual (2014). The Elemental Evil Player's Companion (2015) presents the deep gnome as a player race. Subraces Gnomes in Dungeons & Dragons have been further divided into various subraces: * Rock gnomes are the standard gnome subrace of Third Edition. They live in burrows beneath rolling, wooded hills. * Tinker gnomes are the common gnomes of the Dragonlance campaign setting. In that fictional universe, they dwell in the Mount Nevermind in the world of Krynn. * Svirfneblin, or deep gnomes, dwell in cities deep underground. They are more dangerous than the common rock gnome. * Forest gnomes are smaller than rock gnomes. They are a shy, secretive folk, living deep in wooded areas. Friends to animals, forest gnomes have a racial ability that allows them to speak with small animals. * River Gnomes are graceful and quick. They live in homes dug into the side of riverbanks and speak with river dwelling animals in place of burrowing mammals. They are non-magical but gain +1 to initiative and are proficient swimmers. * Arcane Gnomes are city dwellers. They generally keep to a small community within a larger city. Arcane gnomes are focused on the pursuit of knowledge making their populace, in large part, over-eager inventors or wizards.Dragon Magazine #291 By James Jacobs * Chaos gnomes are the most flamboyant gnomes. Brightly colored and rare, they are strongly inclined towards chaos, as their name suggests. * Whisper gnomes lack the jovial outlook of other gnome races. Sly and suspicious, they are creatures of stealth. * Ice gnomes dwell in the region of Frostfell in the Eberron campaign setting * Fire gnomes live on Bytopia, on the Outer Planes, where they help Flandal Steelskin, the Gnomish god of metal and crafting, in his work. * Sky gnomes appear in the Creature Crucible - PC2 - Top Ballista published in 1989. They are cunning engineers living in the flying city Serraine above the World of Mystara. In the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, gnomes are also known as the \\"Forgotten Folk\\".  Society  Gnome society had changed greatly over the different editions of Dungeons & Dragons. In the first edition, they were portrayed as intensely curious and intellectual, keeping in theme with their spell-casting niche, with an interest in gemstones. They typically lived in hills, and acted as intermediaries between dwarves, elves, and halflings. In the second edition, gnomes received further background. According to The Complete Book of Gnomes and Halflings,Niles, Douglas. The Complete Book of Gnomes & Halflings (TSR, 1993) gnomes have an intricate society based on their love of all kinds of arts, pranks, and their long lives. Their society is based on art; all gnomes must take up some form of art whether music, painting, cooking, building, or any other form that is considered creative by the time they come of age. Gnomes are naturally friendly, highly social and fun loving people. They are respected by Elves for their communion with nature and knowledge of arcane magic, admired by Halflings for their humor, and sought out by Dwarves for their gemcutting skills. Religion Garl Glittergold was created by James M. Ward and first appeared in the \\"Nonhuman Deities\\" chapter of the original Deities and Demigods (1980) as the god of gnomes.Ward, James and Robert Kuntz. Deities and Demigods (TSR, 1980) Roger E. Moore detailed several additional gnomish gods in his article \\"The Gods of the Gnomes\\" in Dragon #61 (May 1982), including: Baervan Wildwanderer, god of adventure and thieves; Urdlen (\\"The Crawler Below\\"), god of evil; Segojan Earthcaller, god of earth and nature; and Flandal Steelskin, god of metalworking;Moore, Roger E. \\"The Gods of the Gnomes.\\" Dragon #61.

Made by a Civilian Conservation Corps tinsmith. Tinsmiths on the roof of Storkyrkan, Stockholm 1903. A tinsmith, sometimes known as a tinner, tinker, tinman, or tinplate worker is a person who makes and repairs things made of tin or other light metals. By extension it can also refer to the person who deals in tinware, or tin plate. Tinsmith was a common occupation in pre-industrial times. Unlike blacksmiths (who work mostly with hot metals), tinsmiths do the majority of their work on cold metal (although they might use a hearth to heat and help shape their raw materials). Tinsmiths fabricate items such as water pitchers, forks, spoons, and candle holders.  Training of tinsmiths  The tinsmith learned his trade, like many other artisans, by serving an apprenticeship of 4 to 6 years with a master tinsmith. Apprenticeships were considered \\"indentures\\" and an apprentice would start out first with simply cleaning the shop, polishing tools, keeping the fires lit, filing sharp edges and polishing finished pieces. Later he would trace patterns on sheets and cut them out, then soldering joints, and inserting rivets. Finally, he was allowed to cut out and complete objects.Kauffman, Henry J. American Copper & Brass. Masthof Press, Morgantown, Pa. 1968. He learned first to make cake stamps (cookie cutters), pill boxes and other simple items. Next, he formed objects such as milk pails, basins, or cake and pie pans. Later he tackled more complicated pieces such as chandeliers and crooked-spout coffee pots. After his apprenticeship was completed, he then became a journeyman, not yet being a master smith employing others. Many young tinsmiths took to the road as peddlers or tinkers in an effort to save enough money to open a shop in town.  Raw material  Tinplate consists of sheet iron coated with tin and then run through rollers. This process was first discovered in the 16th century, with the development of British tinplate address in 1661 with a patent to Dud Dudley and William Chamberlayne.Richards, Alun John. Tinplate in Wales. Llygad Gwalch, Ysgubor Plas, Llwyndyrys. 2008. Previously Great Britain had imported most tinplate from Hamburg. The British Iron Act of 1750 prohibited (among other things) the erection of new rolling mills, which prevented the erection of new tinplate works in America until after the American Revolution. Certificates submitted by colonial governors to the British Board of Trade following the Act indicate that no tinplate works then existed though there were several slitting mills, some described as slitting and rolling mills. Pure tin is an expensive and soft metal and it is not practical to use it alone. However, it could be alloyed with lead and copper to make pewter or alloyed with copper alone to produce bronze. Today's tinplate is mild steel electroplated with tin. Tin's non-rusting qualities make it an invaluable coating. However, tinplate's quality depends on the iron or steel being free from rust and the surface tin an unbroken coating. A piece of tinware may develop rust if the tin coating has worn away or been cut in the metal. The respective properties of the metals mean that corrosion once started is likely to be rapid. Tinsmithing tools The simple shapes made by the tinsmith require tools similar to those of a coppersmith. In addition to the big shears anchored in a hole in his bench he used hand snips and nippers for cutting. The tin was flattened on an anvil made of a block of steel. Straight and curved anvils (stakes) were used to turn and roll the edges of the tin. Solder was then used to join the pieces together; a soldering iron and fire pot were needed to do this. Hammers are essential. Planishing hammers, chasing hammers, creasing hammers and setting down hammers are among the most common, as well as ball peen hammers. Horn or wooden mallets are also used. Before electric soldering irons became available, tinsmiths would use heated \\"copper\\" irons made of a wooden handle, iron shank and copper tips formed into different shapes. These items were heated in small furnaces, covered in sal ammoniac, and then used for soldering seams.Lelegren, Shay. The Complete Tinsmith & Tinman's or Tinner's Trade. Tinsmith Museum of America, 2016. www.hotdiptin.com  History of tinsmithing  Contemporary tinsmith who also serves as a reenactor at Fort Ross State Historic Park, standing with an ear trumpet, a 19th-century hearing aid. Tinwares were being produced in London by the 1630s, being known as Crooked Lane Wares (from the street where they were made). The Worshipful Company of Tin Plate Workers were incorporated as a separate London Livery Company in 1670. However, tinplate workers were widespread. The tinsmith has been plying his trade in America since 1720. Colonial tinsmiths used tinplate, wire, solder, and a few simple tools to produce their wares. When tinplate was finally produced in America in the early 19th century the products of the tinsmith became more widely available. They in turn saw an increase in demand and a need to speed up production. This brought about the development of many ingenious hand powered machines which sped up production and helped the tinsmith meet the demands for his products. The goods were \\"brought to market\\" by peddlers. Tinware was a popular folk art in colonial Mexico and New Mexico, and continues to be made there by local artisans today. An annual tinsmith convergence is held every year in June.

The idea for the D&D; dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D&D; and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which there are more than a dozen across many different rule sets and campaign settings. History The concept of the dwarf comes from Norse and Teutonic mythology. In particular, the dwarves in the Germanic story The Ring of the Nibelungen and the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \\"Rumpelstiltskin\\" have been called \\"ancestors\\" of Dungeons & Dragons dwarves. Along with giants, dwarves were one of the first types of non-humans to be introduced into the Chainmail game, the forebear of D&D;, when miniature figures of varying sizes were used together in the same wargame. The dwarf first appears as a player character class in the original 1974 edition of Dungeons & Dragons, with a design that is strongly influenced by the dwarves of Poul Anderson's 1961 novel Three Hearts and Three Lions. This early version of the D&D; dwarf is limited to playing a fighter, and can not progress beyond the sixth level. The dwarf is again a character class in the original Dungeons & Dragons Basic Set (1977). With the arrival of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, the dwarf was modified into a player character race in the Player's Handbook (1978) and detailed as a monster in the original Monster Manual (1977). A number of dwarven subraces are presented as character races in the original Unearthed Arcana (1985). In 1989, the hill dwarf, the most common dwarven subrace, appears as a character race in the second edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Player's Handbook and as a monster in the Monstrous Compendium Volume Two. Dwarves are detailed as a race for the Forgotten Realms setting in Dwarves Deep (1990). Several dwarven races are detailed as player character races in The Complete Book of Dwarves (1991). The dwarf appears as a character race in the third edition Player's Handbook (2000), the 3.5 revised Player's Handbook (2003), the fourth edition Player's Handbook (2008),Heinsoo, Rob, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. Player's Handbook. (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) and the fifth edition Player's Handbook (2014). The arctic dwarf, gray dwarf, gold dwarf, shield dwarf, urdunnir, and wild dwarf are all detailed in Races of Faerûn (2003). Dwarves are one of the races detailed in Races of Stone (2004). The dwarf, including the dwarf bolter and the dwarf hammerer, appears as a monster in the fourth edition Monster Manual (2008). Description Dwarves average four feet in height, with stout, broad bodies. Male dwarves grow thick facial hair. The female dwarves in The Lord of the Rings novels, which greatly inspired D&D;, were able to grow beards as well. Some authors, such as R. A. Salvatore, have followed suit in their writing, though the game rules' official position is that females do not grow beards—the fourth edition of Dungeons and Dragons portrayed female dwarves as \\"beardless and even attractive\\". In specific campaign settings, the potential for female dwarven facial hair sees much variation: In the World of Greyhawk some females can grow beards but those generally shave, in the Forgotten Realms they can grow full beards but also usually shave, and in Eberron they do not grow facial hair at all. In older editions of the game, female dwarves did grow beards in various campaign settings. The book Three Hearts and Three Lions by Poul Anderson strongly influenced Dungeons & Dragons, having a dwarf named Hugi with a Scottish accent. Most popular portrayals of dwarves feature such an accent. Dwarves tend to be more useful for combat-oriented players, as they gain a number of special abilities and bonuses in combat, mostly related to their hardiness and smaller stature compared to humans. Dwarves are also resistant to poison and magic, can see in the dark (a skill called infravision in earlier editions and darkvision beginning with third edition), and can detect different types of mining-related features underground, such as sloping tunnels. The dwarven ability to detect a sloping passage underground is also taken directly from Anderson's book. Dwarves are generally good in alignment. Ilan Mitchell-Smith wrote that dwarves, along with other races allowed for use by players such as elves and halflings, are \\"defined in terms of subjectivity, and ultimately, humanity\\" as opposed to many other creatures who serve as a type of \\"monstrous other\\". Dwarves usually worship Moradin, whom they believe is their creator. According to their legends, Moradin fashioned the dwarves into a likeness of himself using gems and metal. He then breathed life into them. In many campaign settings, the dwarven pantheon of gods consists of the leader Moradin, as well as Abbathor, Berronar Truesilver, Clanggedin Silverbeard, Dugmaren Brightmantle, Dumathoin, Muamman Duathal, and Vergadain, and Laduguer is god of the duergar. Several gods including Hanseath were introduced in Races of Stone. Other dwarven gods may be present in different campaign settings. Dwarves get along well with gnomes, who are often regarded as close cousins of the dwarven race. Dwarves are accepting of humans, half- elves and halflings. Dwarves often do not get to know humans well as they live longer than the average human, and prefer to become friendly with the human's family in general. Dwarves do not trust half-orcs, and fail to appreciate elves, with whom they only ally in their many battles against orcs, goblins, evil giants and trolls. Subraces Over the history of D&D; publications and rules editions, more than a dozen subraces of dwarf have been described. Hill dwarves are the standard dwarven race. Mountain dwarves live deeper underground and have fairer skin than hill dwarves. Aleithian dwarves are deep-dwelling psionic dwarves who follow the dragon god Sardior.Psionic Bestiary: Aleithian Dwarves - The Legend of Sardior, Part 2 In the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of D&D;, Azers physically resembled dwarves, though they were unrelated. In the 4th Edition of the game, they are a product of the enslavement of dwarves by giants and titans. Badlands dwarves have adapted to life in the inhospitable wastes, developing a natural knack for finding water and tolerance to heat and thirst. Deep dwarves dwell underground and have a greater ability to see in the dark, but are sensitive to light. They are more resistant to magic and poison than standard dwarves. Dream dwarves are contemplative dwarves in touch with the world around them, which they call the \\"earth dream.\\" The duergar are an \\"evil and avaricious\\" subrace that live in the Underdark. Frost dwarves are extra-planar dwarves who reside on the Iron Wastes of the Infinite Layers of the Abyss. They were once duergar enslaved by frost giants. Glacier dwarves reside in cold glaciers, mining a special material known as blue ice. These dwarves have great skill at crafting with ice and magical ice, and are tolerant to cold weather. Seacliff dwarves make their home in high seaside cliffs and are excellent swimmers. =In campaign settings= On Athas, the planet of the Dark Sun campaign setting, dwarves stand less than 5' tall and weigh nearly 200 lbs. Each dwarf pursues a singular obsession, called a focus, that requires at least a week to complete. Athasian dwarves do not live underground, but some communities focus on unearthing long-lost dwarven strongholds. Physically, the dwarves of Athas are unique among their kind, having no hair at all. Athasian dwarves can breed with humans to produce muls, who are sterile offspring that share the strength and resiliency of dwarves with the size of humans. In the Dragonlance setting, the dwarves are divided into three distinct groups, which are sub-divided into clans. Hill dwarves consist of a single clan called the Neidar. They are very similar to the mountain dwarves but are slightly more forthcoming towards other races and cultures. Flint Fireforge, one of the Heroes of the Lance, is a Neidar. Mountain dwarves consist of several clans, two of these being the Hylar and the Daewar clans. Gully dwarves, or Aghar (\\"the Anguished\\") are thought to be the offspring of gnomes and dwarves. Gully dwarves are first referred to in the Dragonlance Chronicles, by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, as a \\"miserable lot.\\" Several clans live together, following the rule of their chieftains or one particular powerful leader. The Forgotten Realms world of Faerûn has several major dwarven subraces. Shield dwarves, also known as mountain dwarves, are the dominant dwarves in the northern parts of Faerûn. These dwarves tend to be fatalistic due to generations of declining numbers. Gold dwarves, also known as hill dwarves, are the dominant dwarves in southern Faerûn. They are generally a more upbeat group than their northern cousins. They primarily reside in and around the Deep Realm, an underground realm surrounding a Grand Canyon-like gorge. Arctic dwarves (also known as the Inugaakalikurit), found in the northernmost reaches of Faerûn, are smaller and stronger than most other dwarves, and immune to cold. Urdunnir, also known as orecutter dwarves, have the magical ability to shape metal and stone, and can walk through the latter. Wild dwarves are short, primitive dwarves found in the deep jungles of Faerûn. Gray dwarves, or duergar, are mainly found in the Underdark, and have an aversion to light. Bruenor Battlehammer, a Shield Dwarf, is the king of Mithril Hall in the Forgotten Realms setting who reclaims his homeland from monsters including a shadow dragon named Shimmergloom that he kills single-handedly. Their gods include Deep Duerra, Gorm Gulthyn, Haela Brightaxe, Marthammor Duin, and Thard Harr. In the World of Greyhawk setting, the group of humans known as Flan call dwarves '. They are found throughout the Flanaess, and are particularly numerous in the Lortmils, Principality of Ulek, Glorioles, Iron Hills, Crystalmists, and Ratik. Lord Obmi is a notable dwarf of the setting, a servant of Iuz and member of the Boneshadow organization. Dwarves of the Spelljammer setting operate in huge spacefaring asteroids, honeycombed with tunnels.

It was released in June 1966 by Blue Note Records. The music combines elements of hard bop and modal jazz. The cover shows Wayne Shorter's first wife, Teruko (Irene) Nakagami, whom he met in 1961. Reception Speak No Evil was one of several albums Shorter recorded for Blue Note in 1964, his first year as a member of Miles Davis's mid-1960s quintet. The album is generally regarded as one of Shorter's finest, and also a highlight of the Blue Note catalogue. The Penguin Guide to Jazz selected this album as part of its suggested \\"Core Collection\\" calling it \\"by far Shorter's most satisfying record\\". Murray Horwitz stated in 2001 that \\"Speak No Evil is sort of a consolidation of Wayne Shorter's compositional excellence. It's so thorough and consistent and wide-ranging.

She was the second wife of the Austrian naturalist and diving pioneer Hans Hass (1919–2013), and worked as a model and actress in several of his underwater natural history films. She was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame and the International Scuba Diving Hall of Fame in 2000.Hans & Lotte Hass Member Roster , Women Divers Hall of Fame (wdhof.org); accessed 14 January 2016. Life and work When Hans Hass was looking for a secretary for his office in Vienna in the summer of 1947, Lotte Baierl took the position. She had just passed her high school exam and was a big fan of Hass. Lotte got to work next to his office to deal with diving equipment and underwater cameras, because she hoped to be allowed to attend Hass's next expedition. She trained in swimming pools, dived and photographed in the lakes around Vienna, and was supported and trained by Hass's assistant Kurt Schaefer. Hans Hass was generally opposed to a woman participating in his expeditions. Lotte, who learned not only to dive but to handle competently an underwater camera, asked repeatedly to be included in his expeditions. Hass finally relented when the film company Sascha Wiener insisted that Hass's next documentary would be made more attractive to a wider audience by a pretty female lead.Fox, Margalit, Lotte Hass, 86, sea diver and filmmaker, New York Times, January 31, 2015, p. B12 They chose Lotte Baierl. The multi-month expedition to the Red Sea in 1950 was difficult but led to the Oscar-winning film \\"Under the Red Sea\\", in which she starred under her maiden name. Hass was the first to film manta rays and whale sharks. Lotte was active there as an underwater photographer and underwater model. To the delight of the audience she wore a revealing swimming costume. In 1970 she published her experiences during the expedition to the Red Sea in her book \\"A Girl on the Ocean Floor\\". Lotte proved to be a photogenic talent. The press were eager for interviews and photos of the sympathetic natural girl with long blond hair who was not afraid of danger and work under water. Soon she was seen on the front pages of leading international magazines and pages of reports. She received film offers from Hollywood, but she refused them all because she did not want to be a full-time actress. Lotte also arrived in the United States, joined their participation in the expedition to the Red Sea in Germany and Austria, but also was criticised, because they doubted the scientific seriousness of Hans Hass. The \\"Hessian messages\\" described the expedition to the Red Sea as a \\"pin-up expedition\\" because of Lotte's participation. Others mockingly titled Lotte Baierl as \\"Lotte Haierl\\" (\\"Hai\\" is German for \\"shark\\"). As late as 1959 the German news magazine Der Spiegel sneered in a television criticism: \\"No cave without Lotte\\". They did not understand what a balancing act Hass had to make for the commercialisation of his films: they were produced in the form of documentaries, but reworked and presented to the audience as feature films. This combination worked surprisingly well: at the 1951 Venice Biennale the film \\"Adventures in the Red Sea\\" was awarded the international prize for feature-length documentaries. In early November 1950, on the return flight from Port Sudan to Vienna, Hans Hass and Lotte Baierl became engaged. Hass's marriage with his first wife, actress Hannelore Schroth, had ended in divorce in April 1950. The civil wedding of Hans and Lotte Hass was held on 29 November 1950 in Küsnacht on Lake Zurich. The church wedding took place in February 1963 in St. Augustin Church in Vienna. In the 1950s, Lotte took part in two \\"Xarifa\\" expeditions of Hans Hass. She and Hans hosted two British television series, Diving to Adventure and The Undersea World of Adventure. After the birth of their daughter, Meta, in 1958, Lotte Hass retired from public life and devoted herself to mainly household and education. They rarely returned before the camera. In 1976 she played a supporting role in Episode 29 \\"The Man from Portofino\\" of the famous detective series Derrick.

The company created and manages the Brazilian postal code system known as Código de Endereçamento Postal. It also provides e-commerce platform (CorreiosNet Shopping), banking (Banco Postal) acting as proxy of Banco do Brasil, Boleto bill payment collection and express mail service Sedex, with its international service network reaching more than 220 countries worldwide. It is the largest employer in Brazil with more than 109,000 own employees and outsourced, being the only company to be present in all municipalities in the country, with a wide network of owned and franchised units. The company is fully owned by the Federal Government of Brazil and subordinated to the Ministry of Communications. History Central Correios post office in São Paulo. An ordinary post office at Coronel Fabriciano, Minas Gerais. The Post Office had its origin in Brazil on 25 January 1663. In 1931 the Decree №20.859 of 26 December merged the Directorate General of Posts to the General Bureau of Telegraphs and creates the Department of Posts and Telegraph.BARROS NETO, João Pinheiro de.Administração Pública no Brasil: uma breve história dos correios. São Paulo; annablume, 2004. The new name and status, ECT, was created 20 March 1969 as a public company under the Ministry of Communications through the transformation of the Federal Authority which was then the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. In the years that followed, several services were being incorporated into the portfolio. Besides the traditional services of letters, courier, postage and telegrams among the new services can be highlighted those belonging to the SEDEX family, express delivery service. In August 2013 the company has provided 2,000 of its mail delivery staff with smartphones to provide real-time information on their deliveries. The move is the first phase of a new Mobility in the Postal Service project in which the company is looking to allow customers to track their deliveries in real time on the Internet. The first phase covered the SEDEX 10 express service in various states (a service that delivers documents and goods with a guaranteed delivery time before 10 am the next day after posting). In December 2013 the company inaugurated its second hybrid mail production center in Santa Catarina. The new facility near Florianópolis will serve the south and the states of Ceará and Bahia. It has the ability to scan and produce 2.7m items each month, a little smaller than the Brasilia plant's 4.5m capacity, which was opened in August of that year. At the moment, the two plants together are producing about 2.5m mailpieces a month, including communications for the Ministry of Health and notifications for the Federal Highway Police and the Judiciary. The company is also planning to open a facility in São Paulo later this year, while next year facilities will be opened in Belém, Salvador and Belo Horizonte as the company's hybrid mail capabilities expand. In February 2014 it was reported that Correios has inked an agreement with its Italian counterpart Poste Italiane to launch a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) in Brazil. Until then Brazil had two MVNOs, Portoseguro and Datora. In October of that year National Presort Inc. has won a $11m contract to upgrade sorting technology, which will see the replacement of controlled electronics, barcode readers and software within existing sorting machinery of Correios.  Logo history  Before 1970 Correios used governmental insignia to identify itself. From 1970 Correios used a logo designed by architectural student Eduardo J. Rodrigues in a public competition. From 1990 on this logo became part of a new logo which basically added a textmark and afforded a colour scheme as part of a broader visual identity. To celebrate its 350th anniversary Correios requested the agency CDA to design a new logo which takes recourse to the original design by Eduardo J. Rodrigues and has been in use since May 2014.

The goal of establishing IASBS was to provide a leading research-based institute in advanced science topics for both researchers and students in Iran.  Introduction  Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) also known as Zanjan Graduate University of Basic Sciences is a public advanced research center and university in Zanjan, Iran. It was founded in 1991 by Prof. Yousef Sobouti, who was the director of the institute until 2010. The goal of establishing IASBS was to provide a leading research-based institute in advanced science topics for both researchers and students in Iran. Now it offers M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics, Geophysics, Biophysics, Biochemistry and Chemistry. Although IASBS was established as a graduate-level degree-granting institution, it also offers a B.Sc. program in Computer Engineering.  The University Campus  Zanjan city in Iranian Azerbaijan region, 298 km to the north-west of Tehran, was chosen for the Institute. The location was far enough from Tehran to not be affected by the distractions of the city but close enough to pursue the many ensuing official and budgetary problems in Tehran. The main campus of the university is located close to Zanjan University of Medical Sciences in Gavazang area, Zanjan, Iran. IASBS campus is widely credited to be a Green campus with plants and greeneries being part of the campus design, even in classes and buildings. Moreover, IASBS is one of the few universities in Iran benefiting from solar energy solutions. Buildings in main campus are: * Department of Physics * Department of Chemistry * Department of Mathematics * Department of Computer Science and Information Technology * Department of Earth Sciences * Department of Biological Sciences * Torkaman Library * House of Science * Science and Technology Park (Zanjan Techno-Center) * University Dining Hall * Gym (I and II) * Mosque * Dormitories  Departments and Research Centers  IASBS has 6 departments and 2 research centers. = Department of Physics = The Physics Department started its activity in 1992 as the first department of IASBS. The M.Sc. program was launched in 1992 with 3 faculty members and 7 students. In 1995, the first Ph.D. students were admitted to work on theoretical condensed matter physics, astrophysics and mathematical physics. After a while, graduate programs in experimental optics were established. In 2000, a 7-year program leading to a Ph.D. degree was established. In this program students directly proceed to their Ph.D. thesis after completing their undergraduate and graduate courses, thereby skipping the M.Sc. dissertation. At present, IASBS is the only institute in the country offering such a program.https://iasbs.ac.ir/departments/physics/ Research in Department of Physics is focused in Astrophysics and Cosmology, Hard condensed matter, Soft condensed matter, Statistical mechanics, Optics and Photonics.https://iasbs.ac.ir/departments/physics/research = Department of Mathematics = Established in 1994, The Department of Mathematics offers M.Sc. and Ph.D programs.

While attending art school in Birmingham, he took up the nickname Lolagon and met Kevin Godley. They became part of several bands together, most significantly 10cc, and in 1976 they left 10cc together to record as Creme & Godley (later Godley & Creme). The pair became music video directors, working with bands including Yes. Creme directed the 1991 Jamaican comedy film The Lunatic. In 1998, Creme became a member of the band Art of Noise, with Anne Dudley and Trevor Horn, and directed videos for the artists who recorded with them, such as Tom Jones. Further work with Horn followed, including forming the band The Producers (now known as The Trevor Horn Band) with Chris Braide and Steve Lipson. Family Creme's son Lalo was a member of the 1990s indie-dance band Arkarna, and has also worked on a number of projects with his father.

Career Born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa, Roberts began his career after service in the U.S. Navy. He was a member of the Ray Robbins band, then quit to join Gene Krupa in 1947 when he was in the same section with Urbie Green. It was Urbie's lyric tenor trombone playing that inspired George to be an \\"Urbie\\" one octave lower. After the Krupa band broke up in 1949, Roberts was a freelance musician in Reno, Nevada, for a year before being hired by Stan Kenton to replace Bart Varsalona, who had left the band during its 1949–50 hiatus. Roberts opted to stay in Los Angeles rather than go with Kenton on his 1953 European tour. Working freelance again, he was introduced to Nelson Riddle by Lee Gillette, one of the executives at Capitol Records who had produced Kenton's recordings. Roberts began recording with Riddle, Don Costa, Billy May, Axel Stordahl, Gordon Jenkins, and Henry Mancini in sessions with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, Sarah Vaughan, and Nat King Cole. As a Hollywood studio musician, Roberts recorded film scores such as Jaws, King Kong, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and served on the staff orchestras of the radio and television networks. Before retiring, he had performed on over 6000 recordings. Roberts died from pneumonia on September 28, 2014, at the age of 86 in Fallbrook, California. He also had multiple sclerosis.

She was a generous benefactress who invested her wealth in churches and hostels and commissioned religious sculptures. Due to legends which first appeared in the 17th century, she has since developed a reputation as a successful alchemist. Like her husband, Perenelle has had a street in Paris, France named after her, rue Pernelle.  Life  There are few confirmed details about Perenelle's place of birth and early life. Perenelle married Nicolas in 1368. She had two previous husbands and brought their fortune to the marriage. The couple remained childless. She and her husband were devout Roman Catholics. The couple contributed to the church by commissioning several sculptures. Nicolas continued this practice after his wife's death. The couple is depicted on the portal of the Chapel of St. James of the Boucherie praying at the feet of St. John, a sculpture which they financed in 1389. They owned several properties and contributed to the building of poor houses. The spelling of her name varies and is sometimes given as Perrenelle, Petronelle or Pernelle. Though the historical Perenelle did exist, there is no historical record indicating that she or her husband were the successful alchemists of later legend.  Death  Perenelle died in 1397. She left her husband a sum of 5,300 Tours pounds. This sum was then contested in court by her sister and brother-in-law.  Reputation as an alchemist  Woodcut from the Booke of Hieroglyphicall Figures given as a representation of Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Perenelle's reputation as an alchemist stems from a book written in 1612, allegedly authored by her husband. However, Nicolas' reputation as an author and immortal alchemical adept is an invention of the 17th century. Perenelle figures prominently in the introduction of this Booke of Hieroglyphicall Figures, where the character of Nicolas outlines his quest for the philosopher's stone. In this story, Perenelle witnesses alchemical projections and aids in chrysopoeia.  Perenelle in fiction  Perenelle's posthumous reputation as an alchemist has led to her portrayal in fantasy fiction alongside her husband. * She is mentioned briefly in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J. K. Rowling, though neither she nor her husband actually appears. * The Sorceress: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel by Michael Scott in which Perenelle is a character. * Stephen Leigh took the mystery surrounding the Flamels and wrote Immortal Muse. * She appears as a character in a crossover story between Will Eisner's The Spirit and Chester Gould’s Dick Tracy in the long-running Dick Tracy comic strip. * In several entries in the Puella Magi Madoka Magica Anime franchise, Perenelle appears as a rare example of an adult Puella Magi. Her most prominent appearance is in the Manga spin-off Puella Magi Tart Magica, which is set during the Hundred Years' War.

He is the Wang Professor of Cognitive and Neural Systems and a Professor Emeritus of Mathematics & Statistics, Psychological & Brain Sciences, and Biomedical Engineering at Boston University.Faculty page at Boston University Career = Early life and education = Grossberg first lived in Woodside, Queens, in New York City. His father died from Hodgkin’s lymphoma when he was one year old. He moved with his mother and older brother, Mitchell, to Jackson Heights, Queens. He then attend Stuyvesant High School in lower Manhattan after passing its competitive entrance exam. He graduated first in his class from Stuyvesant in 1957. He began undergraduate studies at Dartmouth College in 1957, where he first conceived of the paradigm of using nonlinear differential equations to describe neural networks that model brain dynamics, as well as the basic equations that many scientists use for this purpose today. He then continued to study both psychology and neuroscience.Grossberg Interests He received a B.A. in 1961 from Dartmouth as its first joint major in mathematics and psychology. Grossberg then went to Stanford University, from which he graduated in 1964 with an MS in mathematics and transferred to The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now The Rockefeller University) in Manhattan. Grossberg received a PhD in mathematics from Rockefeller in 1967 for a thesis that proved the first global content addressable memory theorems about the neural learning models that he had discovered at Dartmouth. His PhD thesis advisor was Gian-Carlo Rota. = Entering academia = Grossberg was hired as an assistant professor of applied mathematics at MIT following strong recommendations from Kac and Rota. In 1969, Grossberg was promoted to associate professor after publishing a stream of conceptual and mathematical results about many aspects of neural networks. Grossberg was hired as a full professor at Boston University in 1975, where he is still on the faculty today. While at Boston University, he founded the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems, several interdisciplinary research centers, and various international institutions. Research Grossberg is a founder of the fields of computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science, and neuromorphic technology. His work focuses upon the design principles and mechanisms that enable the behavior of individuals, or machines, to adapt autonomously in real time to unexpected environmental challenges. This research has included neural models of vision and image processing; object, scene, and event learning, pattern recognition, and search; audition, speech and language; cognitive information processing and planning; reinforcement learning and cognitive-emotional interactions; autonomous navigation; adaptive sensory-motor control and robotics; self-organizing neurodynamics; and mental disorders. Grossberg also collaborates with experimentalists to design experiments that test theoretical predictions and fill in conceptually important gaps in the experimental literature, carries out analyses of the mathematical dynamics of neural systems, and transfers biological neural models to applications in engineering and technology. He has published seventeen books or journal special issues, over 500 research articles, and has seven patents. Grossberg has studied how brains give rise to minds since he took the introductory psychology course as a freshman at Dartmouth College in 1957. At that time, Grossberg introduced the paradigm of using nonlinear systems of differential equations to show how brain mechanisms can give rise to behavioral functions.Towards building a neural networks community This paradigm is helping to solve the classical mind/body problem, and is the basic mathematical formalism that is used in biological neural network research today. In particular, in 1957-1958, Grossberg discovered widely used equations for (1) short-term memory (STM), or neuronal activation (often called the Additive and Shunting models, or the Hopfield model after John Hopfield's 1984 application of the Additive model equation); (2) medium-term memory (MTM), or activity-dependent habituation (often called habituative transmitter gates, or depressing synapses after Larry Abbott's 1997 introduction of this term); and (3) long-term memory (LTM), or neuronal learning (often called gated steepest descent learning). One variant of these learning equations, called Instar Learning, was introduced by Grossberg in 1976 into Adaptive Resonance Theory and Self-Organizing Maps for the learning of adaptive filters in these models. This learning equation was also used by Kohonen in his applications of Self- Organizing Maps starting in 1984. Another variant of these learning equations, called Outstar Learning, was used by Grossberg starting in 1967 for spatial pattern learning. Outstar and Instar learning were combined by Grossberg in 1976 in a three-layer network for the learning of multi-dimensional maps from any m-dimensional input space to any n-dimensional output space. This application was called Counter-propagation by Hecht-Nielsen in 1987. Building on his 1964 Rockefeller PhD thesis, in the 1960s and 1970s, Grossberg generalized the Additive and Shunting models to a class of dynamical systems that included these models as well as non-neural biological models, and proved content addressable memory theorems for this more general class of models. As part of this analysis, he introduced a Liapunov functional method to help classify the limiting and oscillatory dynamics of competitive systems by keeping track of which population is winning through time. This Liapunov method led him and Michael Cohen to discover in 1981 and publish in 1982 and 1983 a Liapunov function that they used to prove that global limits exist in a class of dynamical systems with symmetric interaction coefficients that includes the Additive and Shunting models.Cohen-Grossberg theorem John Hopfield published this Liapunov function for the Additive model in 1984. Most scientists started to call Hopfield’s contribution the Hopfield model. In 1987, Bart Kosko adapted the Cohen-Grossberg model and Liapunov function, which proved global convergence of STM, to define an Adaptive Bidirectional Associative Memory that combines STM and LTM and which also globally converges to a limit. Grossberg has introduced, and developed with his colleagues, fundamental concepts, mechanisms, models, and architectures across a wide spectrum of topics about brain and behavior. He has collaborated with over 100 PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.Grossberg's PhD students and postdocs Models that Grossberg introduced and helped to develop include: * the foundations of neural network research: competitive learning, self-organizing maps, instars, and masking fields (for classification), outstars (for spatial pattern learning), avalanches (for serial order learning and performance), gated dipoles (for opponent processing); * perceptual and cognitive development, social cognition, working memory, cognitive information processing, planning, numerical estimation, and attention: Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART), ARTMAP, STORE, CORT-X, SpaN, LIST PARSE, lisTELOS, SMART, CRIB; * visual perception, attention, object and scene learning, recognition, predictive remapping, and search: BCS/FCS, FACADE, 3D LAMINART, aFILM, LIGHTSHAFT, Motion BCS, 3D FORMOTION, MODE, VIEWNET, dARTEX, ARTSCAN, pARTSCAN, dARTSCAN, 3D ARTSCAN, ARTSCAN Search, ARTSCENE, ARTSCENE Search; * auditory streaming, perception, speech, and language processing: SPINET, ARTSTREAM, NormNet, PHONET, ARTPHONE, ARTWORD; * cognitive-emotional dynamics, reinforcement learning, motivated attention, and adaptively timed behavior: CogEM, START, MOTIVATOR; Spectral Timing; * visual and spatial navigation: SOVEREIGN, STARS, ViSTARS, GRIDSmap, GridPlaceMap, Spectral Spacing; * adaptive sensory-motor control of eye, arm, and leg movements: VITE, FLETE, VITEWRITE, DIRECT, VAM, CPG, SACCART, TELOS, SAC-SPEM; * autism: iSTART Career and Infrastructure Development Given that there was little or no infrastructure to support the fields that he and other modeling pioneers were advancing, Grossberg founded several institutions aimed at providing interdisciplinary training, research, and publication outlets in the fields of computational neuroscience, connectionist cognitive science, and neuromorphic technology. In 1981, he founded the Center for Adaptive Systems at Boston University and remains its Director. In 1991, he founded the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems at Boston University and served as its Chairman until 2007. In 2004, he founded the NSF Center of Excellence for Learning in Education, Science, and Technology (CELEST)CELEST at Boston University and served as its Director until 2009.\\"$36.5 Million for Three Centers to Explore How Humans, Animals, and Machines Learn\\", National Science Foundation, cited at Newswise, September 30, 2004. All of these institutions were aimed at answering two related questions: i) How does the brain control behavior? ii) How can technology emulate biological intelligence? In addition, Grossberg founded and was first President of the International Neural Network Society (INNS), which grew to 3700 members from 49 states of the United States and 38 countries during the fourteen months of his presidency. The formation of INNS soon led to the formation of the European Neural Network Society (ENNS) and the Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS). Grossberg also founded the INNS official journal,Neural Networks journal and was its Editor-in-Chief from 1988 - 2010.\\"Elsevier Announces New Co-Editor-In-Chief for Neural Networks\\", Elsevier, December 23, 2010 Neural Networks is also the archival journal of ENNS and JNNS. Grossberg’s lecture series at MIT Lincoln Laboratory triggered the national DARPA Neural Network Study in 1987-88, which led to heightened government interest in neural network research. He was General Chairman of the first IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN) in 1987 and played a key role in organizing the first INNS annual meeting in 1988, whose fusion in 1989 led to the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), which remains the largest annual meeting devoted to neural network research. Grossberg has also organized and chaired the annual International Conference on Cognitive and Neural Systems (ICCNS) since 1997, as well as many other conferences in the neural networks field.Grossberg conferences Grossberg has served on the editorial board of 30 journals, including Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, Cognitive Brain Research, Cognitive Science, Neural Computation, IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, IEEE Expert, and the International Journal of Humanoid Robotics.

He won the 2019 Donald O. Hebb award from the International Neural Network Society which is given \\"for outstanding achievements in biological learning\\". ART theory With Gail Carpenter, Grossberg developed the adaptive resonance theory (ART). ART is a cognitive and neural theory of how the brain can quickly learn, and stably remember and recognize, objects and events in a changing world. ART proposed a solution of the stability-plasticity dilemma; namely, how a brain or machine can learn quickly about new objects and events without just as quickly being forced to forget previously learned, but still useful, memories. ART predicts how learned top-down expectations focus attention on expected combinations of features, leading to a synchronous resonance that can drive fast learning. ART also predicts how large enough mismatches between bottom-up feature patterns and top-down expectations can drive a memory search, or hypothesis testing, for recognition categories with which to better learn to classify the world. ART thus defines a type of self-organizing production system. ART was practically demonstrated through the ART family of classifiers (e.g., ART 1, ART 2, ART 2A, ART 3, ARTMAP, fuzzy ARTMAP, ART eMAP, distributed ARTMAP), developed with Gail Carpenter, which has been used in large-scale applications in engineering and technology where fast, yet stable, incrementally learned classification and prediction are needed. New computational paradigms Grossberg has introduced and led the development of two computational paradigms that are relevant to biological intelligence and its applications: Complementary Computing What is the nature of brain specialization? Many scientists have proposed that our brains possess independent modules, as in a digital computer. The brain’s organization into distinct anatomical areas and processing streams shows that brain processing is indeed specialized. However, independent modules should be able to fully compute their particular processes on their own. Much behavioral data argue against this possibility. Complementary Computing (Grossberg, 2000,The complementary brain: Unifying brain dynamics and modularity. 2012Adaptive Resonance Theory: How a brain learns to consciously attend, learn, and recognize a changing world.) concerns the discovery that pairs of parallel cortical processing streams compute complementary properties in the brain. Each stream has complementary computational strengths and weaknesses, much as in physical principles like the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Each cortical stream can also possess multiple processing stages. These stages realize a hierarchical resolution of uncertainty. \\"Uncertainty\\" here means that computing one set of properties at a given stage prevents computation of a complementary set of properties at that stage. Complementary Computing proposes that the computational unit of brain processing that has behavioral significance consists of parallel interactions between complementary cortical processing streams with multiple processing stages to compute complete information about a particular type of biological intelligence. Laminar Computing The cerebral cortex, the seat of higher intelligence in all modalities, is organized into layered circuits (often six main layers) that undergo characteristic bottom-up, top-down, and horizontal interactions. How do specializations of this shared laminar design embody different types of biological intelligence, including vision, speech and language, and cognition?

Laminar Computing explains how the laminar design of neocortex may realize the best properties of feedforward and feedback processing, digital and analog processing, and bottom-up data-driven processing and top-down attentive hypothesis-driven processing.

Photo: Ze'ev Aleksandrowicz Guido Fanconi () (1 January 1892 - 10 October 1979) was a Swiss pediatrician. He was born in Poschiavo, a small village in the Canton of Grisons. Fanconi is regarded as one of the founders of modern pediatrics. He received his secondary school education in Zurich. In 1911, he began his medical training in Lausanne. In 1920, he entered the Kinderspital (Children's Hospital) of the University of Zurich, where, with the exception of one year, he remained for 45 years. Fanconi recognized the importance of biochemistry to clinical medicine. In 1929 he succeeded Emil Feer as professor of pediatrics and head of the Kinderspital. Under his direction, it became one of the most renowned children's hospitals in the world. There are several medical conditions named after Dr. Fanconi. In 1927 he described hereditary panmyelopathy with short stature and hyperpigmentation, better known as Fanconi anemia. In 1934 the first cases of cystic fibrosis of the pancreas were described in a thesis written under his direction. In 1941 a large epidemic of poliomyelitis occurred in Switzerland. Fanconi analyzed its epidemiology and found that the virus was not transmitted by droplet infection, as previously assumed, but rather follows a gastrointestinal pathway like typhoid fever. His understanding of pathophysiologic connections culminated in his prediction that Down syndrome was due to a chromosomal abnormality, 20 years before trisomy 21 was discovered. His contributions to renal physiology led to renal Fanconi syndrome being named for him. In 1945 he founded a new pediatric journal, Helvetica Paediatrica Acta, which has become an internationally renowned periodical. Dr. Fanconi retired in 1965 from his chairmanship in pediatrics, but continued to practice and lecture until his death.

It serves as the primary road through the Napa Valley, providing access to the Lake County region to the north and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area to the south. Route description Route 29 in Vallejo End of Route 29 at Route 20 in Upper Lake SR 29 begins at Interstate 80 (I-80) just north of the Carquinez Bridge in Vallejo. After running through the downtown area of Vallejo, it travels as a four-lane expressway (on some segments, five) through American Canyon to Napa. It then briefly becomes a freeway as it passes through Napa. The highway then runs as a two-lane road through the Napa Valley cities and towns of Yountville, Oakville, Rutherford, St. Helena, and Calistoga, while also passing many of the region's notable vineyards and wineries. This portion of the highway is often heavily congested with rental cars and tour buses in spring and summer, when tourists flock to Napa Valley. North of Calistoga, SR 29 climbs Mount Saint Helena, an extinct volcano, at the border between Napa County and Lake County. The road then heads north to Middletown and Lower Lake before going around the southern and western sides of Clear Lake, the largest natural freshwater lake completely within California. In Lakeport, SR 29 becomes a freeway as it bypasses the city. It then reverts as a two-lane highway before it terminates at Route 20 in Upper Lake. Points of interest along Route 29 include Bothe-Napa Valley State Park, Bale Grist Mill State Historic Park, Robert Louis Stevenson State Park, the St. Helena Toll Road and Bull Trail, the Stone House, and the Lower Lake Stone Jail. SR 29 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System south of the intersection of Oak Knoll Avenue (approximately 1 mile north of the Napa city limits), and north of SR 53 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 29 is eligible for inclusion in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. History Historically, the route between the Napa Valley and Middletown was served by the Old Bull Trail Road, built by volunteers in the 1850s, that had grades of up to 35 percent. In 1868, this was replaced by the St. Helena Toll Road, which had more manageable inclines of up to 12 percent. The State of California purchased the toll road in 1925.

The London Dock strike was an industrial dispute involving dock workers in the Port of London. It broke out on 14 August 1889, and resulted in a victory for the 100,000 strikers and established strong trade unions amongst London dockers, one of which became the nationally important Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union. The strike is widely considered a milestone in the development of the British labour movement, symbolising the growth of the New Unions of casual, unskilled and poorly paid workers, in contrast to the craft unions already in existence. The strike helped to draw attention to the problem of poverty in Victorian Britain and the dockers' cause attracted considerable public sympathy. Background Colonel G. R. Birt, the general manager at the Millwall Docks, gave evidence to a Parliamentary committee, on the physical condition of the workers: > The poor fellows are miserably clad, scarcely with a boot on their foot, in > a most miserable state ... These are men who come to work in our docks who > come on without having a bit of food in their stomachs, perhaps since the > previous day; they have worked for an hour and have earned 5d.; their hunger > will not allow them to continue: they take the 5d. in order that they may > get food, perhaps the first food they have had for twenty-four hours. London > Docklands History accessed 14 Feb 2007 Prior to the strike, few dockers were organised, but once it began, the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers' Union recruited a substantial section of the London docks workforce. The principal demand of the agitation was for the dockers' tanner, meaning a rate of sixpence an hour. The strike was noted for large, peaceful processions which impressed middle class opinion and won sympathy for the strikers' cause from figures such as Cardinal Manning, who acted as meditator between the striking workers and the dock owners. He was seen as fair and impartial by both sides. Upon the resolution of the strike, the dock workers collected £160 for Manning in appreciation of his work, and Manning donated the money to a local hospital to provide a bed. Notable organisers who came to prominence during the strike include Ben Tillett, John Burns, Tom Mann, Ben Cooper, Will Thorne and the seamen's leader Joseph Havelock Wilson. The most notable politician to come to the fore during the strike was the Progressive Party London County Councillor John Benn. As an increasingly prominent local politician, he was invited to stand for Parliament as the Liberal Party candidate for St George Division of Tower Hamlets. He was subsequently elected in the 1892 general election, becoming the first of four generations of the Benn family to serve as MPs. The London Dock Strike was preceded by several other developments which marked the emergence of a new mood amongst the unskilled. The strike of match-girls at the Bryant and May match strike, and the successful organisation of London gasworkers by Will ThorneThe First Dispute:The Eight Hour Day GMB History accessed 22 Jun 2007 were amongst these omens. The dockers' strike was more dramatic than these disputes however, because of the sheer number of workers involved, the poor reputation that dockers previously enjoyed, and various other aspects of the dispute. Dispute The dock strike began over a dispute about 'plus' money during the unloading of the Lady Armstrong in the West India Docks. 'Plus' money was a bonus paid for completing work quickly. The East and West India Docks Company's (E&WIDC;), general manager Lieutenant Colonel John Lowther du Plat Taylor (of 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers) had cut their 'plus' rates to attract ships into their own docks rather than others. Evaluations From the Catholic Church's point of view, Cardinal Manning's involvement in the strike, as a mediator trusted by both sides, could be seen as foreshadowing the encyclical Rerum novarum ('Of New Things') issued by Pope Leo XIII two years later, on 15 May 1891. Addressing \\"the condition of the working classes\\", the Church's policy set out in that encyclical explicitly supported the right of labour to form unions, but rejected socialism and affirmed private property rights. (\\"Each needs the other: capital cannot do without labour, nor labour without capital. Mutual agreement results in the beauty of good order, while perpetual conflict necessarily produces confusion and savage barbarity\\".) Robert Speaight, a biographer of Hilaire Belloc, noted that Cardinal Manning's involvement in the Dock Strike made a major impression on Belloc, 19 years old at the time, who was to become a major speaker for the Catholic Church during the early 20th century. As retrospectively told by Belloc himself in The Cruise of the Nona (1925), the example of Cardinal Manning influenced him to become a trenchant critic both of unbridled capitalism and of many aspects of socialism.

As the leader of the groups Ash Ra Tempel and Ashra in the 1970s and 80s, as well as a solo artist, he is one of the most influential guitarists of the Krautrock (also known as Kosmische Musik) genre. He also participated in the Cosmic Jokers sessions. His style and technique influenced dozens of artists in the post-Eno ambient and Berlin School of electronic music scenes in the 1980s and 1990s. Early Life As a child, Göttsching was exposed to the music of Verdi and Puccini by his mother, who was a fan of opera. He also listened to radio stations run by American and British allied forces. Too young for early rock and roll, it wasn't until the 1960s that Göttsching found the music that really inspired him such as Motown music from the United Stated, as well the Rolling Stones and British blues bands. Originally a classical guitarist, the music he heard inspired him to switch to the electric guitar.https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/manuel-gottsching In school, Göttsching played with a cover band. \\"We played some Rolling Stones, we played some Beatles, we played some Who, some what was the popular music and that was just for fun,\\" he recalls. https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/manuel-gottsching However upon hearing Blue Cheer's proto-metal cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" and learning about the free jazz movement inspired Göttsching and his bandmates to pursue a freer, more improvisatory approach to music. Ash Ra Tempel As Göttsching and his bandmates moved from song-based music to free improvisation, Ash Ra Tempel was born in 1970. \\"We didn’t play blues,\\" Göttsching recalls. \\"We used some elements of it but tried to keep the freestyle of improvisation and using some blues themes.\\" https://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/manuel- gottsching Along with Göttsching, the group included Klaus Schulze (who had just left Tangerine Dream) and Hartmut Enke. Just after Ash Ra Tempel released its self-titled debut album in 1971, Schulze left to pursue what became a successful solo career. https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mn0000513923 In 2000, Göttsching and Klaus Schulze released a studio album and a live album as Ash Ra Tempel. The live album was recorded as part of the Cornucopea concerts curated by Julian Cope at the Royal Festival Hall in London .

Early life Laodice was of Persian and Greek Macedonian ancestry. She was the first born child of the monarchs of the Kingdom of Pontus, Laodice VI and Mithridates V Euergetes, who reigned 150-120 BC.http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/1827.html One of the siblings was Mithridates, who became Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysius, and reigned 120–63 BC. She was born and raised in the Kingdom of Pontus. Between 130-126 BC, her aunt, the sister of Mithridates V, queen of Cappadocia and regent of her son Ariarathes VI Epiphanes Philopator, Nysa of Cappadocia, died. She has been the wife and later the widower of the previous Cappadocian King Ariarathes V Eusebes Philopator.Cartledge, Hellenistic constructs: essays in culture, history and historiography p.139 Mithridates V was aware of the turbulent political situation in Cappadocia, which ended in the death of his sister, Nysa.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.38 In the mid 120’s BC, he became interested in Cappadocia and wanted to expand Pontian foreign policy in that country.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.p.37-38, p.73 He decided to invade Cappadocia.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.p.37-38 Queen consort To fend off any Pontian invasion, Ariarathes VI arranged with Mithridates V to marry Laodice, his paternal cousin. There is a possibility that the invasion of Mithridates V was in fact friendly on behalf of Ariarathes VI to settle internal Cappadocian strife and help him to establish himself as a ruler. The marriage between Ariarathes VI and Laodice marked a cessation of hostilities between Cappadocia and Pontus.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.37 Through this arranged marriage, Mithridates V was able to keep a close check on Ariarathes VI and control Cappadocia indirectly. Laodice presumably could act in her father’s interests. As queen she wielded considerable power. She bore Ariarathes VI three children: Nysa, who married King Nicomedes III Euergetes of Bithynia and two sons, both called Ariarathes, who became Ariarathes VII Philometor and Ariarathes VIII Epiphanes. Mithridates V died in 120 BC and Laodice's first brother, Mithridates VI, succeeded their father as King of Pontus. Ten years later Laodice may have found it much harder to exert control over Ariarathes VI. There could be a possibility that Pontian political influence in Cappadocian affairs may have declined as Ariarathes VI became independent minded and began to assert himself.Mayor, The Poison King: the life and legend of Mithradates, Rome’s deadliest enemy p.129 Mithridates VI continued the Pontian foreign policy in Cappadocia where his father had left off. He plotted with Gordius, a Greek nobleman who was a member of the court of Ariarathes VI and a good friend of Mithridates VI, to assassinate Ariarathes VI between 116 BC-111 BC. Laodice was probably not involved in this murder. Regency After the death of Ariarathes VI, Laodice became the queen regent of her first son, the young Ariarathes VII. Laodice’s former son-in-law and a widower, King Nicomedes III Euergetes, wanted to take advantage of the political situation in Cappadocia. Without informing anyone, he suddenly invaded Cappadocia as Ariarathes VII was underage.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.74 Laodice decided to support Nicomedes III. To preserve Cappadocia, her sovereignty and the succession of her son, she married him. She would also have better opportunities with him.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator p.75 Through this second marriage, she also became Queen of Bithynia. When Mithridates VI heard about the Cappadocian invasion, he hurried there with his army to help his sister, but, given Laodice's marriage, instead helped Ariarathes VII. His sister probably did not forgive him for the murder of her son. Later life Mithridates drove Nicomedes III out of Cappadocia and established himself as the patron of Ariarathes VII. He then pretended that he wanted to recall Gordius from exile hoping that Ariarathes VII would oppose this, thus giving him a pretext for war. Ariarathes VII did oppose this and mobilised an army which matched Mithridates’. Given the size of the force of Ariarathes VII, Mithridates called a conference and used this meeting to murder him in 101 BC or 100 BC. He then installed one of his sons as Ariarathes IX of Cappadocia under the regency of Gordius. Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 38.1 Memnon: History of Heracleia, 22 The Cappadocians revolted and called for Ariarathes’ brother, Ariarathes VIII, to return to Cappadocia to become king in 100 BC. Mithridates invaded Cappadocia and drove him out. Ariarathes VIII died in 96 BC. With his death, his dynasty died out. Nicomedes pretended that Laodice had a third son from him and sent a young man to Rome to apply for the throne of Bithynia from the Roman Senate. He also sent Laodice to Rome to testify that he was Nicomedes' son. At this point, Laodice no longer features in Justin's text, which is our only ancient source regarding her. Mithridates sent Gordius to Rome to testify that Ariarathes IX, whom he had installed as king, was a descendant of Ariarathes V, who died in 130 BC when he supported Rome in a war against Eumenes III of Pergamon. The Senate saw the scheming by both sides and did not assign the Cappadocia to either contender. The text of a decree issued in 95 or 94 B.C by the city of Delphi had survived. It concerned the assignment of tasks for thirty slaves which king Nicomedes and queen Laodice provided when the city sent delegates to them to ask them for slaves. The decree also made arrangements for honouring Nicomedes and Laodice. It provided for the erection of a statue of the king and one of queen in the most prominent place in the temple of Pythian Apollo and for the grant to the two monarchs and their descendants of proxeny, priority of access to the oracle of Delphi and in receiving justice, tax exemption, privileged seating at the city’s games and other privileges that were given to other proxenoifriends of the city who were given same rights as its citizen, except for public office, and free trade in the city. and other benefactors of the city.OGIS: 345 Regarding the outcome of the two embassies sent to Rome, the Roman Senate ordered Mithridates to leave Cappadocia and Nicomedes to leave Paphlagonia. In order not to offend the two kings by giving what was taken from them to other kings, it also ordered that the peoples of both states were to have an elective republic. However, the Cappadocians wanted to retain a kingdom. Therefore, the Senate appointed Ariobarzanes I as their king.Justin: Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 38.2 Literature She is remembered in De Mulieribus Claris, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature.

They usually featured a face value of \\"4000 réis\\", the Portuguese coat of arms on the obverse, and the Order of Christ Cross on the reverse, and were minted from 1677 to as late as 1910, mainly in Portugal and in Portuguese colonies like Brazil and Mozambique. Gold coins were also issued in fractions or multiples of moidores, ranging from one-tenth of a moidore to five moidores.Shaw 1896, p. 212. An example of a Portuguese gold coin, king Sebastian of Portugal (1557–1578) The real (meaning \\"royal\\", plural: réis or [archaic] reais) was the currency unit of Portugal from around 1430 until 1911, when the escudo was introduced after the 1910 Republican Revolution. Since the Portuguese empire spread throughout a vast number of territories that are now part of 53 different sovereign states, the moidore was used as currency not only in those regions but also in other regions of the globe, including Western Europe and the West Indies. The currencies of several Arabic countries are named rial or riyal after the Portuguese real. Etymology The word moidore is a loanword from the Portuguese \\"moeda d'ouro\\", literally meaning \\"gold coin\\". England and her colonies sterling value of 27 shillings Moidores circulated widely in England and her colonies, although the coin colloquially known as the moidore was in fact the double moidore.Encyclopaedia Britannica 1911. It was the principal coin current in Ireland at the beginning of the 18th century, and spread to the west of England. The single moidore was generally assigned a sterling value of about 13 shillings 5½ pence, and the double moidore one of about 27 shillings, or in Ireland 30 shillings.Douglas 2011, pp. 80–81.Shaw 1896, pp. 161, 166, 178, 180, 194. Literary references Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) contains numerous references to moidores: e.g., \\"I am persuaded, that by the improvements I had made in that little time I lived there, and the increase I should probably have made if I had stayed, I might have been worth a hundred thousand moidores\\"; \\"the old man let me see, that he was debtor to me four hundred and seventy moidores of gold\\"; \\"the value of plantation increasing, amounted to 38892 crusadoes, which made 3241 moidores\\"; and \\"he sent me on board a present of fresh provisions, wine, and sweetmeats, worth above thirty moidores\\".

Set primarily in Spain, it tells a frame story containing gothic, picaresque and erotic elements. In a deserted house during the Napoleonic Wars, two officers from opposing sides find a manuscript, which tells the tale of the Spanish officer's grandfather, Alphonso van Worden (Zbigniew Cybulski). Van Worden travelled in the region many years before, being plagued by evil spirits, and meeting such figures as a Qabalist, a sultan and a Romani person, who tell him further stories, many of which intertwine and interrelate with one another. The film was a relative success in Poland and other parts of socialist eastern Europe upon its release. It later also achieved a level of critical success in the United States, when filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola rediscovered it and encouraged its propagation. In the 2015 poll conducted by Polish Museum of Cinematography in Łódź, The Saragossa Manuscript came second on the list of the greatest Polish films of all time. Plot During a battle in the Aragonese town of Saragossa (Zaragoza) during the Napoleonic Wars, an officer retreats to the second floor of an inn. He finds a large book with drawings of two men hanging on a gallows and two women in a bed. An enemy officer tries to arrest him but ends up translating the book for him; the second officer recognizes its author as his own grandfather, who was a captain in the Walloon Guard. The ancestor, Alfonso van Worden (Zbigniew Cybulski), appears with two servants, seeking the shortest route through the Sierra Morena Mountains. The two men warn him against taking his chosen route because it leads through haunted territory. At an apparently deserted inn, the Venta Quemada, he is invited to dine with two Moorish princesses, Emina (Iga Cembrzyńska) and Zibelda (Joanna Jędryka) in a secret inner room. They inform the captain that they are his cousins and, as the last of the Gomelez line, he must marry them both to provide heirs. However, he must convert to Islam. He jokingly calls them ghosts (despite having told his servants with great bravado that ghosts do not exist). Then they seduce him and give him a skull goblet to drink. He wakes and finds himself back in the desolate countryside, lying next to a heap of skulls under a gallows. He meets a hermit priest who is trying to cure a possessed man; the latter tells his story, which also involves two sisters and a different kind of forbidden love. Alfonso sleeps in the hermitage's chapel, hearing strange voices at night. When he wakes and rides off, he is captured by the Spanish Inquisition. But he is rescued by the two princesses, aided by the gang of the Zoto brothers (two of whom had appeared dead on the ground near the gallows). Back in the inner room, the two princesses become amorous with Alfonso but they are interrupted by Sheikh Gomelez, who forces the captain to drink the skull goblet at sword point. Again Alfonso awakens at the gallows, but this time a cabalist is lying next to him. As they ride to the Cabalist's castle, they are joined by a skeptical mathematician, who remarks, \\"The human mind is ready to accept anything, if it is used knowingly.\\" Thus ends part 1 of the film. Part 2 is primarily filled with the nested tales told by the leader of a band of gypsies who visit the castle. Frame story or tale-within-a-tale-within-a-tale only begins to describe the complexity, because some of the inner tales intertwine, so that later tales shed new light on earlier experiences recounted by other characters. Multiple viewings of the film are recommended in order to comprehend the plot, as well as identify the appearance of certain characters before they are \\"introduced\\" by the gypsy raconteur to tell their own tales.Martin Schell's Saragossa Manuscript website Finally, Alfonso is told to return to the Venta Quemada, where he meets the two princesses. They bid him farewell and the Sheikh gives him the large book so that he can write the end of his own story. The Sheikh explains that the whole adventure was a \\"game\\" designed to test Alfonso's character. Alfonso wakes under the gallows again, but his two servants are nearby – it is as if they are about to begin the journey that he has just \\"dreamed\\". At the small inn in Saragossa, he writes in the large book until someone tells him that the two princesses are waiting for him. He flings the book aside and it lands on the table where his descendant's enemy found it at the beginning of the film.

Release The film was released in Poland uncut at 182 minutes, but it was shortened for release in the U.S. and UK at 147 minutes and 125 minutes, respectively. Though an underground favorite, the film faced idiosyncratic distribution, particularly in the United States. At one point the American rights to the film were owned by a butcher in Chicago who had only a few prints. By the 1990s there was only one known subtitled print in the entire world and it was found to be incomplete. Jerry Garcia would become interested in the film when he saw it in 1966 at the Cento Cedar in San Francisco. In the 1990s, Jerry Garcia offered archivist Edith Kramer 6,000 dollars to help find and restore a subtitled print of the film. Kramer purchased the film from Parisian distributor , but soon realized that it was incomplete. Jerry Garcia died the day after the print arrived from France. With Garcia out of the picture and the existence of any definitive print uncertain, Martin Scorsese stepped in, spending $36,000 to locate, restore, and subtitle Wojciech Has's personal print. The restored film, re-released in 2001, is commercially available in VHS and DVD formats. In 2011, the film has been digitally restored in HD https://pisf.pl/aktualnosci/cyfrowa-rekonstrukcja-polskich- filmow-the-chimney-pot-wideo/ by Kino Polska with partial funding provided by Polish Film Institute and is available on Blu-ray. https://www.amazon.com/Saragossa-Manuscript-Zbigniew-Cybulski/dp/8364361112/ The film is among 21 digitally restored classic Polish films chosen for Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema.Martin Scorsese Presents: Masterpieces of Polish Cinema Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on , with a weighted average rating of 7.8/10. Polish critic writes that, \\"The film remains a towering oddity more than a half-century after its premiere: budgeted at eighteen million zlotys at the time, when a regular feature cost one-third of that amount, it may be the strangest film epic of all time, with a Chinese-box narrative structure that still dazzles with its intricate, convoluted beauty.\\" Kristin Jones of the Wall Street Journal writes that, \\"As it interweaves the rational with the supernatural, The Saragossa Manuscript becomes a celebration of storytelling and the marvels of cinema. It also suggests the inevitability of returning to the past; more than one narrative wormhole leads back to the foot of a gallows before the tales continue.\\" References External links * * Category:1965 films Category:Films based on Polish novels Category:Films directed by Wojciech Has Category:Films set in Spain Category:Films set in the 18th century Category:Films shot in Poland Category:Napoleonic Wars films Category:Polish films Category:Polish-language films ","title":"The Saragossa Manuscript (film)"},{"id":"2593581","text":"Sarcina as illustrated on Trajan's Column Soldiers with marching packs on Trajan's Column Reconstruction The sarcina was the marching pack carried by Roman legionaries, the heavy infantry of the Roman legions. Most of a legionary's equipment other than his arms and armour would, in early times, have been consigned to a baggage train and borne by mules and carts. However, following the reforms of the Roman general Gaius Marius, the soldiers were expected to carry much of their rations and equipment themselves. This was done to reduce the size of the baggage train and increase the mobility of the army by allowing the soldiers to move strategically (i.e. quickly) independently of the train. Such was the load of the soldiers that they became known as Marius' Mules. The appearance of the marching pack is known from illustrations on Trajan's Column. Here it can be seen that a legionary's sarcina was carried on a pole called a furca and would have included: *Loculus – a satchel *Cloak bag *Cooking pot *Patera – mess tin *Netted object However, this was certainly not the limit of the soldiers load. Time and again, Roman writers emphasise the importance of soldiers being self-sufficient and not tied to the baggage train. The 2nd-century historian Appian of Alexandria records the actions of Scipio Aemilianus Africanus in late 3rd century BC. This was mainly with the objective of improving the morale of the soldiers, but it is also clear that the army is expected to be mobile: > He ordered all wagons and their superfluous contents to be sold, and all > pack animals, except such as he designated, to remain. For cooking utensils > it was permitted to have only a spit, a brass kettle, and one cup. Their > food was limited to plain boiled and roasted meats. They were forbidden to > have beds, and Scipio was the first one to sleep on straw. He forbade them > to ride on mules when on the march; \\"for what can you expect in a war,\\" said > he, \\"from a man who is not able to walk?\\" Those who had servants to bathe > and anoint them were ridiculed by Scipio, who said that only mules, having > no hands, needed others to rub them.Appian's History of Rome: The Spanish > Wars The 1st-century historian Josephus, recorded the items carried in his own time: > besides a saw and a basket, a pick-axe and an axe, a thong of leather and a > hook, with provisions for three days, so that a footman hath no great need > of a mule to carry his burdens. The Wars Of The Jews Book 3, chapter 7. The 4th century writer Vegetius advises that: > The legion is provided with iron hooks, called wolves, and iron scythes > fixed to the ends of long poles; and with forks, spades, shovels, pickaxes, > wheelbarrows and baskets for digging and transporting earth; together with > hatchets, axes and saws for cutting wood. De Re Militari Book II: The > Organization of the Legion. Vegetius was not clear that the soldiers were required to carry these items personally, but it is known that soldiers were required to carry entrenching tools (such as the dolabra) and turf cutters for the construction of a temporary camp at the end of each day's march. Probably a variety of tools and equipment was carried distributed among the members of a contubernium. They may also have carried baskets and one or more sudes (stakes). There have been many attempts to reconstruct the sarcina and its component parts for historical reenactment.

Lorgnette used by David Scott Mitchell A lorgnette () is a pair of spectacles with a handle, used to hold them in place, rather than fitting over the ears or nose. The word lorgnette is derived from the French lorgner, to take a sidelong look at, and Middle French, from lorgne, squinting. They became popularized by Englishman George Adams when he designed a practical case meant to be carried in the pocket.George Adams; The lorgnette was usually used as a piece of jewelry, rather than to enhance vision. Fashionable ladies usually preferred them to spectacles. These were very popular at masquerade parties and used often at the opera. They were worn popularly in the 19th century. The lorgnette was employed as a prop and affectation by early 20th century trial lawyer Earl Rogers, and one is featured on the front cover dust jacket of his biography, Final Verdict, by his daughter Adela Rogers St. Johns.Final Verdict by Adela Rogers St. Johns, 1962, Doubleday & Co.  Etymology  This word comes from French lorgnette, from lorgner (to take a sidelong look at), but it is a false friend: the equivalent French name for this (obsolete) optical instrument is un face-à- main while une lorgnette (or une lunette d'approche, une longue-vue) usually means a ship captain's (monocular) telescope.

Early life Upton was born in Flushing, New York, to British parents who had immigrated recently. She was the second of four children in a creative and slightly eccentric household. Florence's father, Thomas Harborough Upton, worked as a confidential clerk at the American Exchange Bank in New York. In 1884 the family moved from Flushing to central Manhattan, which was more convenient for her father's daily journey to his office. The National Academy of Design, located near the new home, offered free instruction to anyone who could qualify. This prompted her father to enroll in evening classes and Florence, at 15 years old, joined him for the beginning of her formal art training. Early career In June 1889 the family was placed in financial difficulty by the sudden death of Thomas Upton. Florence's mother, Bertha, had a trained singing voice and began to give voice lessons in the home. Her older sister Ethelwyn found work, while her younger siblings Alice and Desmond remained in school. Florence, at age 16, obtained work as a professional illustrator. Numerous publications existed at this time, mainly as vehicles for advertising and light fiction of varying merit. Some of the same authors whose stories appeared in the magazines went on to employ Florence to illustrate their novels or books of short stories. Finances eventually stabilised to such a degree that in 1893 the family was able to pay an extended visit to Bertha's relatives, the Hudsons, who lived in the Hampstead area of London. With an established reputation from her published work in New York, Florence had no difficulty in finding employment with London publishers. When the rest of the family returned to the United States she opted to stay in England and began experimenting with ideas to supplement her income so that she could afford further art training. Golliwogg Illustration for The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg, 1895 Upton began to sketch out ideas for a children's book, using \\"penny wooden\\" dolls as her models. However, without a central character on which to hang the tale, progress came to a standstill. Her aunt, Kate Hudson, found an old toy in her attic that had belonged to the Upton children, left behind from an earlier visit. This toy, which she named Golliwogg, provided inspiration, and the first story was completed in 1894. The publishing house of Longmans, Green & Co. offered her a contract and The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls and a Golliwogg was published for Christmas 1895. During her stay in London, Upton provided illustrations for The Strand Magazine, The Idler and Punch. The American Society in London also commissioned a series of drawings and cartoons to decorate the souvenir programme of their November 1896 Thanksgiving Banquet. After three years of work, she returned to New York to attend the Art Students League, then continued studies in Paris and Holland. Returning to London in 1906 to take up permanent residence, she moved to 21 Great College Street in 1910. Through the years Florence and Bertha collaborated on thirteen Golliwogg adventures, beginning with The Adventures of two Dutch Dolls and a “Golliwogg”. For example, the cover of the first “Golliwogg” book stated 'words by Bertha Upton'. Over the years, cultural drift caused interest in the series to wane, and Florence sought a career as a professional artist. The last of the books was published in 1909. Upton continued to study and paint, concentrating mainly on portraits. She exhibited at the Royal Academy and other prominent venues and rapidly established a reputation as an accomplished society portraitist. Additionally, she received hundreds of commissions from the families of young soldiers. For health reasons Florence was found unfit to serve in any physical capacity during the First World War. Instead she aided the war effort by donating her original dolls and drawings to a fund-raising auction for the Red Cross, conducted by Christie's in 1917. The dolls, sold as a lot for 450 guineas, funded the purchase of an ambulance, christened 'Golliwogg', which went to the front and served in France. Death At the age of 49, Florence Upton died in her studio on 16 October 1922, from complications following surgery. She is buried in Hampstead Cemetery. Legacy The original Golliwogg and Dutch Dolls resided for many years at Chequers, the Prime Minister's country estate in Buckinghamshire. They are now at the V&A; Museum of Childhood in Bethnal Green, London. It is difficult nowadays to appreciate the enormous impact that the Golliwogg had at the height of its popularity. Florence Upton's friend and biographer Edith Lyttelton recollected, 'One of my children, long before we knew who Bertha and Florence Upton were, had a passionate attachment to the doll stories, and a new Golliwogg book was a great excitement in my nursery as in countless others.' Florence did not patent the character. Recognising a large and profitable market, many toy companies took advantage of the popularity of the books and manufactured the doll, while other writers and illustrators took equal advantage, many changing the nature of the series. In 1910, John Robertson, of the jam manufacturing family James Robertson & Sons, decided it should be the company's mascot, which it remained until 2002. The prolific Enid Blyton chose to depict golliwogs in a number of her stories as naughty individuals. Other authors took a similar tack. The name \\"golliwog\\" came to be used as a degrading term for anyone who wasn't white-skinned, and new origins were suggested for the word. Florence Upton despaired, 'I am frightened when I read the fearsome etymology some deep, dark minds can see in his name.'

Beacon has a Stock Market Club, Debate Team, Model Congress, Model UN, Math Club, Beacon Drama Arts Theater (B'DAT), Film Club, Photo Club, Arts Committee, Senior Committee, Yearbook, Beacon Ink Literary Magazine, Live Poet's Society, Student Leadership Team, and Student Government, as well as a wide variety of additional student clubs and activities such as \\"Beacon Ink,\\" the student-run literary magazine that publishes creative writing and artwork. Beacon was founded in 1993 as an alternative to the Regents Exam-based testing system in favor of portfolio- based assessment. The school's purpose was also purportedly to keep class sizes down and total student population at, or just above, one thousand students. The total population, for example, was once listed in a 1998 high school selection guide as \\"less [sic] than 600 students.\\" Over time, Beacon was forced to accept certain aspects of the Regents-based testing curriculum, and to abandon its portfolio-assessment system as the sole method of graduation, which had been the case until mid-1999. Beacon now utilizes, in its own words, \\"traditional testing ... [but] our students' progress is largely assessed through performance-based projects, completed individually and in groups. To graduate, students must present their best work to panels of teachers.\\" Academics =Overview= The class schedule at the Beacon School is organized in bands, designated by letters A through H. As a Beacon student advances in grade level, s/he is gradually given more opportunity to choose classes of his or her choice in the subject area of the band in question, rather than relying on his or her stream to do the selecting. This is both a preparatory measure for the university system of class selection, where students are permitted to select all their classes themselves on an individual basis, as well as a means of allowing students the ability to find what interests them among the course offerings. Beacon also offers several Advanced Placement courses. AP courses are currently available for biology, calculus, physics, and Spanish. Students take the Advanced Placement exam at the end of the course, and have an opportunity to attain college credits. =In-school requirements= Though the yearly schedule is broken into two semesters, these are not standard United States college semesters. Most academic classes are year-long courses, so students generally return to their classes with the same teachers for the second semester. Students have the opportunity to change electives at the end of each semester. Certain science courses are offered to students on a per-semester basis. =Internships and community service= The school does not require its students to do internships, but internship opportunities are available for those that want to pursue them. A minimum of 50 hours of community service hours is a strictly enforced graduation requirement, and can be fulfilled however a student likes, as long as s/he clears the work with a community service leader in writing before beginning it. The community service program is led by a faculty advisor but taught by a group of dedicated 11th and 12th graders called \\"The Community Service Leadership Team\\". This group of students plan lessons and activities to get lowerclassmen excited about community service placements across the city at non-profits such as the Added Value Farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn and Community Voices Heard in East Harlem. Beacon states: > Every tenth grader (15-16 year old) at the Beacon School takes the Community > Service class in either the Fall or Spring semester. We try to provide > internships that are educational for students and at the same time > meaningful for the community. Beacon students reflect on their experience in > written journals and in a weekly classroom seminar. Beacon students are > expected to work five hours per week over a semester (about 4 months) in a > site that they select\\" but they may complete the hours through the course of > 1 year. They may negotiate any work schedule that is convenient to > themselves and their community service site. A total of 50 hours is required > for passing credit in the course. Students who complete 75 hours are > eligible for \\"honors\\" credit. Physical plant =1993 to 2015= For its first year, The Beacon School was located inside Fordham University, Lincoln Center Campus. It also utilized John Jay College of Criminal Justice's facilities for physical education. From 1994 to 2015, the school had been located three blocks from Jay, at 227 West 61st Street, a former warehouse completed in 1919, alongside the Amsterdam Houses, a group of New York City Housing Authority projects. This The Beacon School location has been replaced by West End Secondary Schoolhttps://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20140915/upper-west-side/school- opening-beacon-hs-space-use-city-as-extension-of- classroom/https://www.westendsecondary.com/. It was in an area with many other schools, including Public School 191 and Abraham Joshua Heschel School across the street. =2015 to Present= The school's 43rd street entrance As of September, 2015, Beacon occupies a seven-story building located at 522 West 44th Street, between 10th and 11th avenues. The building, previously used as a book warehouse by the New York Public Library was sold to the School Construction Authority for $45 million in August, 2011. Construction began in August, 2012, with a ground breaking ceremony attended by high-ranking city officials including City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, Department of Education Chancellor Dennis Walcott, and Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\\"City Breaks Ground on New Beacon School in Hell's Kitchen\\" The building, built by Skanska USA for $88 million, houses a full-sized cafeteria, black-box theater, dance studio, auditorium, film lab, and library, with writing labs, art studios, and study spaces throughout the building. Culture The Beacon School offers extracurricular activities such as after school theater and studio stage crew, book club, a rock climbing club, a dance club, a Live Poets Society, Entrepreneurship club, art club, music performance, a photo club, a Senior Committee (populated by seniors who are responsible for helping with plans for graduation and the annual senior trip), and a Model United Nations club. The Beacon School has a debate team. There is currently no student government or council, and SOS and other activists club have largely been disbanded. It also features charity clubs, such Project ABLE, which raises money for libraries in Africa, and the Kids for Kids Club, which raises money for local and nonlocal causes. In 2007 the school made front page news after David Andreatta confirmed that the school took illegal trips to Cuba. At the end of the school year the teacher involved, Nathan Turner, resigned. In 2005, then Lt. Governor Paterson sent his daughter on one such trip. Alumni reaction to the trips was mixed, with some alumni continuing to be involved in activism, while others have expressed frustration with the liberal leanings of their teachers and peers. Educational travel has become an important part of the educational culture. Past destinations included India, Cuba, Spain, England, Ireland, Venezuela, France, Sweden, Costa Rica, Mexico, Mozambique, South Africa, and New Orleans. Athletics The Beacon School offers an array of athletic teams for its students. Sports including fencing, softball, track, wrestling, bowling, basketball, Ultimate, soccer, cross country, and tennis form a part of the culture at Beacon. In 2014, Beacon's tennis team won the national tennis championship as a result of taking first place at the All-American Invitational Boys Tennis Tournament in Corona del Mar, California. Because the school does not have a practice space of its own, the school uses many of the city's public access facilities. In addition, the boys baseball team advanced to the Public School Athletic League (PSAL) AAA championship game, which was played in Yankee Stadium on June 4th in which they lost to Gregorio Luperon HS for Science and Math with a final score of four to five.  Beacon Model United Nations  English: Beacon's Model UN team accepts the Best Delegation Award at GCIMUN 2016 in the General Assembly hall at the UN Headquarters, New York City. Beacon's Model United Nations debates solutions to international issues, and attends conferences within New York City, as well as throughout the United States. In 2016, Beacon's delegation placed first among 174 schools from over 30 countries in the Global Classrooms Model United Nations conference. The conference, held annually at United Nations Headquarters, is sponsored by the United Nations Association of the United States in collaboration with the Lebanese American University. Since 2016, Beacon's Model United Nations program has been cited at the top of Best Delegate's annual list of the world's best high school Model UN teams. The rankings, calculated based on data aggregated from the 30 most competitive Model UN conferences in North America, divide teams into groups by region and overall standing. Beacon is ranked in the Top 25 Overall category, the highest level of recognition awarded by the publication.  Performing arts  B'DAT (Beacon Drama Art Theatre) is Beacon's extracurricular theater program, spearheaded by Jo Ann Cimato. Beacon Music is Beacon's music performance and sonic arts program, largely focusing on contemporary music, recording, and mixing. It is led by Brian Letiecq. Student demographics , student demographics were as follows: 48.7% White, 22.8% Hispanic, 13.5% Black, 9% Asian, Two Races 5.7%. Approximately 65 out of 100 students are female. Students commute from all boroughs of New York City, however the plurality of students reside in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The school has experienced a significant decline in the number of Black and Hispanic students since its founding due to changes in the admissions policy.

Paccar acquired the company in 1980, and ceased to use the marque name in 2006. History Edwin Foden (1841-1911) who lends his name to Foden's Motor Works Band too 1930 Foden steam lorry Foden F1 1931 diesel, on display at the Science Museum, London 1959 Foden S20 dropside Foden S21 tractor unit – DAX6/32 6x2 Twin Steer Tractive Unit, JDN 672E 1967 Foden S36 flatbed In 1856 Edwin Foden, became an apprentice at the agricultural equipment manufacturing company of Plant & Hancock. He left the company for an apprenticeship at Crewe Railway Works but returned to Plant & Hancock at the age of 19. Shortly afterwards he became a partner in the company. On the retirement of George Hancock in 1887 the company was renamed Edwin Foden Sons & Co. Ltd. The company produced massive industrial engines, as well as small stationary steam engines and, from 1880, agricultural traction engines. Experimental steam lorries were first produced shortly after the turn of the 20th century. In 1878, the legislation affecting agricultural use was eased and as a result, Foden produced a successful range of agricultural traction engines. The perfecting of the compound traction engine in 1887 gave a significant marketing advantage and later proved invaluable to the development of the steam lorry. In 1896 the restrictions affecting road transport were eased, which permitted vehicles under 3 tons to travel at up to without a red flag. The time was right and Foden produced a series of four prototype wagons. The experience gained from this, enabled Foden to build a 3-ton wagon for the War Office 1901 self-propelled lorry trial.History of Foden Trucks Classic Motor History This design was consistently faster and more economical over the arduous road trials but was placed second overall as it was claimed that the Thornycroft entry had better off-road performance. Foden's wagon was nevertheless regarded by most commentators as a clear winner (the result was questioned in Parliament by Crewe's MPSelf propelled lorries). This model was the basis for a highly successful line of vehicles which were produced over the next 30 years. The great majority of Foden steam lorries were overtype, but undertypes were also produced, including the unsuccessful E-type and the O-type \\"Speed-6\\" and \\"Speed-12\\", which was a much more modern vehicle. By 1930, Edwin's son, Edwin Richard Foden (known to everyone as simply E.R.) could see the future lay in diesel power. In late 1932 he resigned from the Board of Directors, following several years of bitter wranglings, and subsequently retired; he was 62 and ready for retirement, having spent his entire working life at Foden's. His son Dennis could not afford to resign, but was not prepared to let things ride; however, with financial input from across the immediate family a new company was set up to design and produce diesel lorries. George Faulkener, related to Dennis by marriage, became works manager and Ernest Sherratt, both ex-Foden employees, helped to design a new diesel wagon. Edwin Richard Foden was persuaded to come out of retirement and head the new company which became known as ERF. In the early 1930s, however, Foden realised that the future was diesel, and changed their production almost immediately, though the production of steam vehicles continued in diminishing numbers until 1934. Their first diesel vehicle was the Foden F1 introduced in 1931 and regarded as the \\"first commercially successful type of diesel lorry\\".Quotation from display annotation at Science Museum, London; (date seen 23 January 2015) Post-war initially saw the re- introduction of the old models with few improvements, although Foden entered the bus chassis market in 1946 (a number of prototypes, including a double- decker had been built in the 1930s) by 1950 they had developed a rear-engined model, predating the Leyland Atlantean by seven years. Although the Foden PVR was a high-framed single decker, the cruciform chassis bracing used by Foden made an underfloor engine location as in the competitive AEC Regal IV, Leyland Royal Tiger or Daimler Freeline a non-starter. The completely new FE and FG lorry ranges were introduced in 1948, along with the new Foden FD6 two-stroke diesel engine, which became the standard engine for certain Foden heavy lorry models, such as the S18 FE6/15 Rigid Eight-Wheeler – the optional Gardner 6LW- engined version was the S18 FG6/15. (The S18 designation refers to the new cab that was produced for the new range.) The FD6 two-stroke engine, along with Gardner engines, was also fitted in Foden motorcoaches and buses. Only one Foden PVD double decker had the Foden Engine but it was popular in the PVS and PVR single-deckers, especially in coaching applications because it was much higher revving than the Gardner 5LW or 6LW. Bus and coach production ceased in 1956, but the last chassis only left the works in 1959, when it was registered 367CKA and received an early Plaxton Panorama body. In 1958 lightweight glass- reinforced plastic (GRP) used in cab production was introduced, and this led to the manufacture of the first British-built, mass-produced tilting cab in 1962. The first Foden GRP cab was the distinctively-styled S21 model. The S21 was initially nicknamed both \\"Spaceship\\" and \\"Sputnik\\" by the commercial vehicle press but was more popular by the \\"Mickey Mouse\\" nickname. The more traditional metal-and-wood S20 cab, introduced in 1956, was still fitted to many Foden lorries until at least 1963, after which it was just fitted to special vehicles until 1968. The aforementioned GRP tilt cab, introduced in 1962, was designated S24. S21 Cab production continued until 1969. Science Museum at their Wroughton store. In 1964, a change in the Construction & Use Regulations favoured articulated vehicles over the older rigid designs and a new model was introduced to compete in the 32-ton market. More than 75% of heavy chassis sold in Britain in the following years were tractor units. In 1969, Foden made its first sales in Portugal. Because the company name was similar to a profanity in Portuguese, they were badged as Podens.A Poden for Portugal Commercial Motor 19 December 1969 page 12When a Foden is a Poden Truck & Bus Transportation April 1970 page 56 =Collapse and takeover= A massive new production facility was developed in the early 1970s on a green field site, adjacent to the Foden works. The new plant was designed for an annual capacity of 6,000 trucks, based on an expectation of a continued boom in truck sales and exports. Instead, the market collapsed. The expenditure and the economic downturn of the period saw Foden run into financial difficulty in December 1974. It was given support by Harold Wilson's Labour government. Foden struggled as its home market continued to be depressed. It was 1977–78 before Foden returned to reasonable profitability. Large MOD contracts to supply military vehicles helped with this recovery.K. Bhaskar, The Future of the UK Motor Industry, (London: Kogan Page, 1979), p. 248, 253, 284 The military required fibreglass cabs (strengthened for military use), meaning that civilian Foden trucks were constructed in the same way. After a period in receivership in 1980 the company was acquired by the American firm Paccar, becoming a division of that company. By 1986, Foden employed a workforce of 450, as compared to around 3,000 at the high point. Foden specialised in highly customisable trucks, offering any paint, any drivetrain available, and even split windscreen Kenworth C500 oilfield trucks were also built in small numbers at the Sandbach plant.Barden, pp. 42-43 After the takeover of Leyland Trucks by Paccar in 1998, independent Foden production ceased, and was replaced by models of DAF Trucks rebadged as Fodens (DAF Trucks having been acquired by Paccar in 1996). These vehicles have had the option of either Caterpillar, Detroit Diesel, or Cummins ISMe engines. Marque retirement 2004 Foden Alpha 3000 In 2005, Paccar announced that Foden production was likely to cease in 2006. The reason given was that Foden production would be terminated to release manufacturing capacity at Leyland Trucks to allow for increased volume of DAF brand trucks. The last Foden was produced in July 2006, putting an end to 150 years of Foden truck manufacturing. The final vehicle to roll off the production line at the factory in Leyland was an 8x4 rigid, which was delivered to the nearby British Commercial Vehicle Museum.

It broadcast from a converted Dutch lugger called Oceaan 7 positioned in international waters off Scarborough, North Yorkshire followed by a move to a more sheltered position off the coast of Bridlington. Origins In 1965 a group of Yorkshire businessmen formed a consortium to establish an offshore radio station to broadcast to the North East coast from a location off Scarborough. Don Robinson, aged 28, who was an entertainments promoter, began the venture with Bill Pashby (a fishing boat skipper), Roland Hill (a poultry farmer) and Leonard Dale (owner of the Dale Electrics business at Gristhorpe). These recruited Wilf Proudfoot, owner of a chain of supermarkets and a former Conservative MP. The venture was incorporated within a public company named Ellambar Investments Ltd. In late 1965, Proudfoot addressed a public meeting at a Scarborough hotel in which he invited the public to subscribe for shares in the business. He indicated that the venture was a high risk one and that nobody should expect a commercial return on the money they put in. Around sixty people did subscribe with the largest single shareholding being held by Proudfoot himself. Leonard Dale became Chairman of the company while Proudfoot became its managing director. Don Robinson and Bill Pashby both initially occupied prominent roles in what soon became known as Radio 270. Robinson prepared the first programme plan for the station which adopted a mixture of light music and lifestyle material. It was intended to provide an \\"up-market\\" offering which would compete directly with the BBC's Light Programme. Pashby was the station's first \\"Maritime Director\\" and it was he that picked out a suitable vessel for use as a broadcasting platform and supervised its fitting out.Scarborough Maritime Centre :Radio 270 However, the business side of the operation fell increasingly under the control of Wilf Proudfoot. The station's management was run from an office in the Scalby Road, Scarborough headquarters of the Proudfoot supermarket business. The station's office manager was Maggie Lucas, a long-standing associate of Proudfoot who had acted as his secretary when he had been the Member of Parliament for Cleveland from 1959 to 1964. Proudfoot became uncomfortable with the planned programming and he engaged the services of Noel Miller as Programme Director. Miller had previous experience of commercial radio in Australia and he adopted a simple style of programming based on a Top 40 format. An aerial view of Scarborough: South Bay, with fishing harbour to the left A planned opening date of 1 April 1966 had to be abandoned when the station's vessel, Oceaan 7, shed its radio mast. However, the station finally opened in June, broadcasting on 1115 kilohertz, 269 metres, in the medium wave. This wavelength was used by some existing radio stations in southern and eastern Europe but these were too far away for Radio 270 to cause them any trouble. However, the frequency was close to Radio London on 1133 kHz, resulting in the potential for mutual interference on radios with less precise tuning. The initial results were highly successful. The station's broadcasts could be received over a large tract of eastern England from Newcastle in the north to Nottingham in the south, containing as many as 15 million people. It even gained some listeners in the Netherlands. Its continuous pop music format attracted a regular audience which various estimates placed between 1.5 and 4 million. The station charged a basic £30 for a 30-second advertising spot. It was very successful in attracting advertising for local businesses and events in the North Yorkshire area. Even Scarborough Borough Council paid for twelve 15 second adverts to announce events in the town's Festival of Norway. However, big-ticket advertising for national businesses proved elusive. The largest single paying advertiser was the Worldwide Church of God which purchased a nightly 30 minute slot for a fee of around £300 per week. This covered most of Radio 270's payroll. The nightly \\"god slot\\" contained the preaching of evangelist Garner Ted Armstrong. The second largest advertiser was the Proudfoot supermarket business. This created a complex financial situation in which there were two-way transfer charges between Radio 270 and Proudfoot for reciprocal services rendered. Oceaan 7 In 1965, the promoters of Radio 270 identified a Dutch built fishing lugger named Oceaan VII as being suitable for their purposes. This was acquired for £2,500. The Oceaan VII was built in the Netherlands in 1939 and had spent most of its life operating out of the Belgian port of Antwerp. During World War II it had been commandeered by the German occupation authorities. It was approximately 118 feet long and 160 tonnes in displacement. The vessel was refitted in the east coast port of Grimsby before being brought to Scarborough where it was renamed Oceaan 7. The refit involved the addition of 20 tonnes of permanent ballast in the hull in order to give extra stability. The vessel was fitted with a 150 feet high radio mast and a 10 kW RCA BTA 10J1 transmitter. The vessel's main engine was a four-cylinder 240 hp diesel. Two newly installed 50 kva Dale Marine generators supplied all electricity needed for operational purposes. Oceaan 7 off Scarborough in 1966 There were two studios on board, one for presenting programmes and one for news. Accommodation for crew and broadcasting staff was both confined and spartan. Living quarters consisted of a bunk room with a dining table in the middle. Food was provided from a communal galley. The entire cost of acquiring and fitting out the vessel was £75,000. The crewing was initially planned to be on a one-month rotation basis. The ship's entire eight man crew including the captain were switched every month. Broadcasting staff, including disc jockeys, initially worked on a two-week rotation basis.Radio 270 :corporate history The Oceaan 7 was among the smallest of the pirate radio ships at that time. By way of comparison, Radio London broadcast from the 650 tonne MV Galaxy positioned in the Thames estuary. Oceaan 7's initial location off Scarborough allowed its signal to be widely received over the North of England but left the vessel totally exposed to storms in the North Sea. Oceaan 7 was registered in Honduras in the name of Radio 270's Programme Director Noel Miller (an Australian national). This effectively placed the vessel beyond the reach of the British authorities. Most pirate radio ships were kept supplied from shore by tender. However Oceaan 7s small size allowed it to periodically enter Bridlington and Scarborough harbours for re-supply purposes. The visits to harbour were usually carried out in the early hours of the morning in order to avoid disruption to broadcasting and to minimise the chances of intervention by the authorities.  Operations, 1966 to 1967  Although Radio 270 quickly established itself as a successful local radio station, its affairs soon became complicated. Various factors contributed to this. Oceaan 7 was very small for the purpose to which it was being put. The cramped living accommodation and lack of privacy on board soon caused tensions among the personnel. It proved difficult to maintain the vessel in position off Scarborough as the winter storms came. In November 1966 one storm was so severe that waves were breaking over the vessel's deck and water entered the living quarters and studio. The station carried on broadcasting through the early part of the storm although the presenters were obviously in fear for their lives. Listeners on-shore (including 270 staff member Paul Burnett) were horrified by what was happening. In the aftermath of the storm, the station went off the air for 8 days while repairs were carried out. Some of the shareholders became concerned about the degree to which Radio 270's business was being integrated within that of Proudfoot's. Issues relating to the latter's management style were raised. Conditions of employment and rates of pay were not generous. Consequently, there were a series of disputes with personnel and staff turnover rates became high. Matters came to a head after the November storm when Proudfoot was approached by three disc jockeys (including the 19 year old Andy Kirk) with a demand that Oceaan 7 should move its station to a more sheltered location in Bridlington Bay or put into harbour whenever bad weather threatened. Kirk had previously conveyed his concerns about safety to the local press. Proudfoot summarily dismissed all three of the DJs.Radio 270 :history, part 1 A number of the shareholders now became restless and two attempts were made to oust Proudfoot from his post of managing director. Both of these attempts failed. Bill Pashby resigned as Maritime Director \\"...fed up with the continuous sackings of the crew\\". Proudfoot eventually responded to these concerns by moving Oceaan 7's position to Bridlington Bay while moving to a one-week staff rotation for most on-board personnel. The move to Bridlington Bay gave more settled conditions but it worsened reception of Radio 270's signal across large parts of its audience catchment area. By early 1967, Radio 270's affairs seemed to be stabilising and it was reported that the station was breaking-even financially.Radio 270 :booklet Close down The pirate radio stations attracted opposition from within the British political establishment. It was claimed that their broadcasts interfered with emergency service communications, and this led to enactment of the Marine Offences Broadcasting Act of 1967, which took effect at midnight on 14 August of that year. This Act prohibited the management, funding, support or supply of pirate radio ships from the British mainland. The pirate stations campaigned against the Act during the early months of 1967. Radio 270 was prominent in this campaign and its contributions to the campaign took on an overtly political dimension. A group of Conservative MPs and activists became involved with Radio 270. These included the MP for Beverley, Patrick Wall. The station gave airtime to a number of political causes including a broadcast by Wall in which he advocated British recognition of the white minority UDI regime in Rhodesia. Radio 270 broadcast advertisements supporting Conservative party candidates in the Scarborough municipal elections of 1967. Harvey Proctor, then Chairman of the University of York Conservative Society, made regular half hour current affairs broadcasts. Proctor went on to have a controversial career as a Conservative MP and prominent member of the Conservative Monday Club. This appeared to harden the Labour government's resolve to deal with the pirates. Postmaster- General Edward Short stated about Radio 270 that \\"It is the first time in peacetime that this country has been subjected to a stream of misleading propaganda from outside our territorial waters and I do not think this is a matter for joking\\".The Times : 12 May 1967 As 14 August approached, it was initially suggested that Radio 270 could continue broadcasting but with Oceaan 7 being supplied from the Netherlands and the station's management being shifted to that country. However, it was soon realised that this was not a viable option. DJ Vince \\"Rusty\\" Allen closed the station at one minute to midnight on 14 August 1967.The Yorkshire Post :1 April 2009The Pirate Radio Hall of Fame :Vince Allen Aftermath On 15 August Oceaan 7 sailed up the coast to Whitby. It was laid up there whilst a buyer was sought. It was advertised for sale via Tuckley and Co, a local estate agent with a reputation for amusing property ads. Various enquiries were received from prospective buyers including one from the operators of Radio Caroline, whose own ships had been seized by creditors. However, none of these enquiries resulted in a sale. The transmitter and other broadcasting equipment from Radio 270 were placed in storage and in 1970 found their way to the Dutch-based pirate Capital Radio (which had no connection to the later British radio station of the same name). Oceaan 7 was scrapped in 1969. The proceeds from the disposal of the vessel and its equipment raised a total of around £12,500. By the time creditors had been paid off there was no cash available to allow a significant return of capital to the Radio 270 shareholders. As far as is known, none of the shareholders ever achieved a direct financial return on their investment. Wilf Proudfoot stood as the Conservative candidate in the marginal West Yorkshire constituency of Brighouse and Spenborough, where he ousted the sitting Labour MP Colin Jackson by a majority of only 59 votes.1970 general election :results The closure of the pirate radio stations is believed to have been a key issue in a number of marginal seats. Proudfoot himself lost his seat in the February 1974 general election. Thereafter he spent some time in the USA where he trained as a hypnotist in Los Angeles. He later established the Proudfoot School of Clinical Hypnotism and Psychotherapy based in Scarborough.The Proudfoot School : website Don Robinson continued his career as an events promoter and entrepreneur. He is credited with having saved Hull City football club ('The Tigers') from extinction in 1982 when he bought the club out of receivership.

The East Cavalry Field fighting was an attempt by Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's Confederate cavalry to get into the Federal rear and exploit any success that Pickett's Charge may have generated. Union cavalry under Brig. Gens. David McM. Gregg and George Armstrong Custer repulsed the Confederate advances. In South Cavalry Field, after Pickett's Charge had been defeated, reckless cavalry charges against the right flank of the Confederate Army, ordered by Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick, were easily repulsed, resulting in the death of Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth. Background and cavalry forces =Military situation= Cavalry forces played a significant role at Gettysburg only on the first and third days of the battle. On the first day (July 1), the Union cavalry division of Brig. Gen. John Buford successfully delayed Confederate infantry forces under Maj. Gen. Henry Heth until Union infantry could arrive on the battlefield. By the end of the day Buford's troopers had retired from the field.Clark, pp. 44-47; Coddington, pp. 266-67. On the Confederate side, most of Maj. Gen. Stuart's cavalry division was absent from the battlefield until late on the second day. Possibly misunderstanding orders from Gen. Robert E. Lee, Stuart had taken his three best brigades of cavalry on a pointless ride around the right flank of the Union Army of the Potomac and had been out of touch with the main body of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia since June 24, depriving Lee of critical intelligence information and screening services. Stuart arrived from Carlisle at Lee's headquarters shortly after noon on July 2 and his exhausted brigades arrived that evening, too late to affect the planning or execution of the second day's battle. Hampton's brigade camped to the north, following a relatively minor clash with Union cavalry at Hunterstown that afternoon.Coddington, pp. 266-67; Eicher, pp. 506-7; Sears, p. 257; Wert, p. 258. Lee's orders for Stuart were to prepare for operations on July 3 in support of the Confederate infantry assault against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. Stuart was to protect the Confederate left flank and attempt to move around the Union right flank and into the enemy's rear. If Stuart's forces could proceed south from the York Pike along the Low Dutch Road, they would soon reach the Baltimore Pike--the main avenue of communications for the Army of the Potomac--and they could launch devastating and demoralizing attacks against the Union rear, capitalizing on the confusion from the assault (Pickett's Charge) that Lee planned for the Union center.Wert, pp. 255-56; Coddington, p. 520; Sears, p. 391; Longacre, p. 221. Confederate cavalry forces under Stuart for this operation consisted of the three brigades he had taken on his ride around the Union Army (commanded by Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton, Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and Col. John Chambliss) and the brigade of Col. Albert G. Jenkins (under the command of Col. Milton J. Ferguson following Jenkins' wounding on July 2). Although these four brigades should have amounted to approximately 5,000 men, it is likely that only 3,430 men and 13 guns saw action that day.Sears, pp. 459-60; Wert, p. 260, claims 5,000 troopers; Longacre, p. 220, 6,000. And following their nine-day ride around Maryland and Pennsylvania, they and their horses were weary and not in prime condition for battle.Coddington, p. 250. Union cavalry forces were from the corps of Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton, who did not participate directly in the command of any cavalry actions during the Battle of Gettysburg. Since most of Buford's division had retired to Westminster, Maryland (with the exception of his reserve brigade under Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt, which was deployed directly south of Gettysburg), only two divisions were ready for action. Stationed near the intersection of the Hanover Road and the Low Dutch Road-- directly on Stuart's path--was the division of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg. Gregg had two brigades present at Gettysburg, under Col. John B. McIntosh and Col. J. Irvin Gregg (David Gregg's cousin), but the latter was stationed on the Baltimore Pike. David Gregg's one-brigade command was supplemented by the newly formed \\"Michigan Brigade\\" of Brig. Gen. George Armstrong Custer. Custer was assigned to the division of Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick but happened to be on loan to David Gregg and requested permission from Gregg to join his fight. Altogether, 3,250 Union troopers opposed Stuart. The other brigade from Kilpatrick's division, commanded by Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth, was stationed to the southwest of the Round Top mountain, the area now known informally as South Cavalry Field.Sears, p. 460; Wert, p. 256. =Principal commanders of cavalry at Gettysburg, July 3= File:J._Gurney_&_Son_- _J.E.B._Stuart.jpgMaj.

This was a foolish error because he also alerted Gregg to his presence. The brigades of McIntosh and Custer were positioned to block Stuart. As the Confederates approached, Gregg engaged them with an artillery duel and the superior skills of the Union horse artillerymen got the better of Stuart's guns.Sears, p. 460; Coddington, p. 521; Wert, p. 264. Stuart's plan had been to pin down McIntosh's and Custer's skirmishers around the Rummel farm and swing over Cress Ridge, around the left flank of the defenders, but the Federal skirmish line pushed back tenaciously; the troopers from the 5th Michigan Cavalry were armed with Spencer repeating rifles, multiplying their firepower. Stuart decided on a direct cavalry charge to break their resistance. He ordered an assault by the 1st Virginia Cavalry, his own old regiment, now in Fitz Lee's brigade. The battle started in earnest at approximately 1:00 p.m., at the same time that Col. Edward Porter Alexander's Confederate artillery barrage opened up on Cemetery Ridge. Fitz Lee's troopers came pouring through the farm of John Rummel, scattering the Union skirmish line.Longacre, p. 226; Sears, p. 461; Wert, p. 265. Gregg ordered Custer to counterattack with the 7th Michigan. Custer personally led the regiment, shouting \\"Come on, you Wolverines!\\". Waves of horsemen collided in furious fighting along the fence line on Rummel's farm. Seven hundred men fought at point-blank range across the fence with carbines, pistols and sabers. Custer's horse was shot out from under him, and he commandeered a bugler's horse. Eventually enough of Custer's men were amassed to break down the fence, and they caused the Virginians to retreat. Stuart sent in reinforcements from all three of his brigades: the 9th and 13th Virginia (Chambliss' Brigade), the 1st North Carolina and Jeff Davis Legion (Hampton's) and squadrons from the 2nd Virginia (Lee's). Custer's pursuit was broken, and the 7th Michigan fell back in a disorderly retreat.Sears, p. 461; Wert, pp. 266-67. Stuart tried again for a breakthrough by sending in the bulk of Wade Hampton's brigade, accelerating in formation from a walk to a gallop, sabers flashing, calling forth \\"murmurs of admiration\\" from their Union targets. Union horse artillery batteries attempted to block the advance with shell and canister, but the Confederates moved too quickly and were able to fill in for lost men, maintaining their momentum. Once again the cry \\"Come on, you Wolverines!\\" was heard as Custer and Col. Charles H. Town led the 1st Michigan Cavalry into the fray, also at a gallop.Wert, pp. 268-69; Sears, pp. 461-62. A trooper from one of Gregg's Pennsylvania regiments observed, As the horsemen fought desperately in the center, McIntosh personally led his brigade against Hampton's right flank while the 3rd Pennsylvania under Captain William E. Miller and 1st New Jersey hit Hampton's left from north of the Lott house. Hampton received a serious saber wound to the head; Custer lost his second horse of the day. Assaulted from three sides, the Confederates withdrew. The Union troopers were in no condition to pursue beyond the Rummel farmhouse.Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 269. The losses from the 40 intense minutes of fighting on East Cavalry Field were relatively minor: 254 Union casualties --219 of them from Custer's brigade--and 181 Confederate. Although tactically inconclusive, the battle was a strategic loss for Stuart and Robert E. Lee, whose plans to drive into the Union rear were foiled.Sears, p. 462; Wert, p. 271. South Cavalry Field Gettysburg South Cavalry Field On the morning of July 3 Union Cavalry Corps commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton ordered two of his brigades to the left flank of the Union army. He ordered Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's Reserve Brigade of Buford's division to move north from Emmitsburg to join Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's division, moving from Two Taverns on the Baltimore Pike to the area southwest of Round Top. By this time the only brigade in Kilpatrick's division was that of Brig. Gen. Elon J. Farnsworth, Custer's brigade having been detached for service with David Gregg at East Cavalry Field. It is unclear what Pleasonton hoped to accomplish. There is no record that he performed any reconnaissance in this area. It has been speculated that Army of the Potomac commander George G. Meade was preparing for a possible counterattack to follow the repulse of Pickett's Charge, which he had anticipated since the night before.Symonds, pp. 254-55; Sears, pp. 462-64; Coddington, pp. 523-25. Farnsworth reached the area at approximately 1:00 p.m., about the time the massive Confederate artillery barrage started in preparation for Pickett's Charge, and his 1,925 troops took up a position in a line south of the George Bushman farm. From left to right, the regiments were the 18th Pennsylvania Cavalry, the 1st West Virginia and 1st Vermont. Battery E, 4th U.S. Artillery, occupied a small, rocky knoll in the rear and the 5th New York cavalry was placed in a nearby ravine to guard the artillery. Joined by Kilpatrick, they awaited Merritt's brigade, which arrived at about 3:00 p.m. and took up a position straddling the Emmitsburg Road, to Farnsworth's left. By this time the infantry portion of Pickett's Charge had begun, and Kilpatrick was eager to get his men into the fight.Longacre, p. 240; Wert, pp. 272-73. On the Confederate line to the east of the Emmitsburg Road, only infantry troops were involved. The four brigades of Hood's division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Evander M. Law, had occupied the area from Round Top, through Devil's Den and back to the road since the battle on July 2. Initially, Law had just the 1st Texas Infantry (from Brig. Gen. Jerome B. Robertson's Texas Brigade) facing Farnsworth to the south, but he soon reinforced them with the 47th Alabama Infantry, the 1st South Carolina and artillery. To the west of the road, facing Merritt, was the Georgia brigade of Brig. Gen. George \\"Tige\\" Anderson.Wert, pp. 273-75. Young Kilpatrick had little experience in commanding cavalry, and he demonstrated that by attacking fortified infantry positions in a piecemeal fashion. West of the road Merritt went in first, with his 6th Pennsylvania cavalrymen fighting dismounted. Anderson's Georgians repulsed their attack easily. Farnsworth was to follow, but he was astonished to hear Kilpatrick's order for a mounted cavalry charge. The Confederate defenders were positioned behind a stone fence with wooden fence rails piled high above it, too high for horses to jump, which would require the attackers to dismount under fire and dismantle the fence. The terrain leading to it was broken, undulating ground, with large boulders, fences and woodlots, making it unsuitable for a cavalry charge. Accounts differ as to the details of the argument between Farnsworth and Kilpatrick, but it is generally believed that Kilpatrick dared or shamed Farnsworth into making the charge the latter knew would be suicidal. Farnsworth allegedly said, \\"General, if you order the charge I will lead it, but you must take the awful responsibility.\\"Wert, p. 276. First in the assault was the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, led by Col. Nathaniel P. Richmond. They rode in great confusion after coming under heavy fire from the 1st Texas, but they were able to breach the wall. Hand-to-hand fighting with sabers, rifles and even rocks ensued, but the attack was forced back. Of the 400 Federal cavalrymen in the attack, there were 98 casualties. The second wave came from the 18th Pennsylvania, supported by companies of the 5th New York, but they were also turned back under heavy rifle fire, with 20 casualties.Longacre, pp. 241-42; Wert, pp. 276-77. It was finally the turn of the 1st Vermont Cavalry, about 400 officers and men, which Farnsworth divided into three battalions of four companies each under Lt. Col. Addison W. Preston, Maj. William Wells and Capt. Henry C. Parsons. Parsons' battalion led the charge, passing the Texans and riding north toward the John Slyder farm. Evander Law sent three Georgia regiments (the 9th, 11th and 59th) to move to the support of the Texans and the artillery batteries. A staff officer carrying the order encountered the 4th Alabama, which also joined in support. An Alabama lieutenant yelled, \\"Cavalry, boys, cavalry! This is no fight, only a frolic, give it to them!\\" And the infantrymen found many easy targets.Longacre, p. 242; Wert, pp. 277-78; Sears, p. 464; Symonds, p. 255. All three battalion advances were turned back with great losses. The final group, led by Wells and Farnsworth, circled back toward Big Round Top, where they met a line of the 15th Alabama across their front. Farnsworth's party had dwindled to only ten troopers as they weaved back and forth, trying to avoid the murderous fire. Farnsworth fell from his horse, struck in the chest, abdomen and leg by five bullets. Postwar accounts by a Confederate soldier who claimed Farnsworth committed suicide with his pistol to avoid capture have been discounted. Maj. Wells received the Medal of Honor for his heroism in leading the rest of his men back to safety. The Vermont regiment suffered 65 casualties during the futile assault.Symonds, p. 255; Trudeau, p. 519; Longacre, p. 243; Wert, pp. 279-80; Sears, p. 464; Parsons, Vol III, p. 396 (footnote) explains how the suicide accounts may have originated. Kilpatrick's ill-considered and poorly executed cavalry charges are remembered as a low point in the history of the U.S. cavalry and marked the final significant hostilities at the Battle of Gettysburg. Six miles (10 km) west of Gettysburg one of Merritt's regiments, the 6th U.S. Cavalry, was defeated that afternoon at Fairfield by Brig. Gen. William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones' \\"Laurel Brigade,\\" an action not considered to be a formal part of the Battle of Gettysburg but one that had a critical role in the retreat of Lee's army.Pfanz, p. 52; Longacre, pp. 235-36; Wert, pp. 280-83. All of Pleasonton's cavalry brigades were exercised for the remainder of the Gettysburg Campaign in the lackluster pursuit of Lee's army back across the Potomac River.Pfanz, pp. 53-54; Sears, pp. 471-92; Coddington, pp. 537-72.

Rolling Stone magazine termed him \\"legendary\\".\\"Legendary DJ Muni Dies\\", Rolling Stone magazine, September 29, 2004. Accessed February 22, 2007. Early life Born Donald Allen Muñoz in Wichita, Kansas, Muni grew up in New Orleans. He joined the United States Marine Corps and began broadcasting there in 1950, reading \\"Dear John\\" letters over Radio Guam. After leaving the Corps and having considered acting as a career, he began working as a disc jockey; in 1953 he began working at WSMB in New Orleans. His mentor was Marshall Pearce. In 1955 he took over for Alan Freed at station WAKR in Akron, Ohio, and after that worked in Kankakee, Illinois. Career Muni then spent almost 50 years at stations in New York City. He became a Top 40 broadcaster at 570 WMCA in the late 1950s, just before the start of their \\"Good Guys\\" era, and did a number of record hops in the New York area. In 1960, he moved to rival Top 40 station 770 WABC. There he did an early evening show called \\"Scotland's Yard\\" and was among the first WABC DJs to capture the attention of the teenage audience for which the station would become famous. He also participated in the competition to cover The Beatles on their first visits to the United States, and thus began a long association with them. In 1965, Muni left WABC and ran the Rolling Stone Night Club while doing occasional fill-in work for WMCA. Muni had explored some opportunities beyond radio: for a short time he co-hosted a local weekly television show on WABC-TV 7 with Bruce \\"Cousin Brucie\\" Morrow, and he would go on to record the spoken single \\"Letter to an Unborn Child\\", about a soldier with a premonition, which was released in 1967 to little acclaim. Muni decided to return to radio, and in 1966, he joined 98.7 WOR-FM, one of the earliest stations in the country to program free-form Progressive Rock music. The progressive format did not last at that station. In 1967 Muni moved to 102.7 WNEW-FM, which had been running a format of pop hits and show tunes, hosted by an all-woman staff. This time, the Progressive Rock format really took hold, with WNEW-FM becoming a legendary rock station. Muni stayed there for three decades as the afternoon DJ and sometimes program director. Muni was described by fellow WNEW-FM DJ Dennis Elsas as \\"the heart and soul of the place\\". Under assorted management changes during the 1990s WNEW-FM lost its way, and in 1998 Muni ended up hosting a one-hour noontime classic rock program at WAXQ \\"Q104.3\\", where he worked until suffering a stroke in early 2004. Muni was known to his listeners by the nicknames \\"Scottso\\" or \\"The Professor\\", the latter to emphasize his rock expertise. While he sometimes spoke in roundabout phrases and succumbed to progressive rock radio clichés such as \\"That was a tasty cut from ...\\", he also conveyed on the air and in his professional relationships a gruff immediacy that was a by-product of both his time in the Marines and his earlier Top 40 skills. His low, gravelly voice was instantly recognizable and often lampooned, both by other disc jockeys and by impressionists such as on Imus in the Morning. A bizarre exchange occurred on October 6, 1975 when a hostage-holding bank robber called Muni on the air and engaged him in a long, often nonsensical conversation; the two peppered their post-hippie speech with discussions of Bob Dylan music and requests to hear the Grateful Dead. Muni specialized in playing records from up-and-coming, or sometimes just-plain-obscure, acts from the United Kingdom on his weekly Friday \\"Things from England\\" segment. He also hosted the syndicated radio programs Ticket to Ride and Scott Muni's World of Rock. Muni often referred to \\"we interviewed so and so,\\" making reference to himself and either \\"Black\\" Earl Douglas or another producer. Indeed, Muni was friendly with many of the musicians whom he played, and they would often stop by the studio to visit on- air. He played poker in the studio with the Grateful Dead, and he would let Emerson, Lake & Palmer browse the station's huge record library and put on whatever they liked.http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwclassical/article/BWW- Interviews-Keith-Emerson-of-THE-CLASSICAL-LEGACY-OF-A-ROCKSTAR-20141006 An oft-related story tells that he was interviewing Jimmy Page when the guitarist suddenly passed out from the aftereffects of the Led Zeppelin lifestyle. Muni calmly put on a record, revived Page, and completed the interview on the studio floor. Muni was close to John Lennon and his family, and after Lennon's murder he vowed to always open his show with a Lennon or Beatles record, a pledge that he kept for the balance of his career. In addition to radio broadcasting, Muni also did voice-over work for radio and television; the most known were a commercial for Rolaids antacid (\\"How do you spell relief?\\") and promos for Monday Night Football. He also voiced episodes of NBC's Friday Night Videos during 1985–86 and promos for ABC Sports which included boxing events on Wide World of Sports, the USFL on ABC, the Pro Bowlers Tour, the Sugar Bowl, the 1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs & Auto Racing including the Indy 500. His voice is also heard giving the introduction on the 1971 live albums Chicago at Carnegie Hall and Melanie at Carnegie Hall.  Personal life  Muni had five children: three with his first wife and two with his second wife, to whom he was married from 1966 until his death in 2004.  Death and legacy  He died on September 28, 2004 at the age of 74 in New York City and is buried in St. Gertrude's Roman Catholic Cemetery in Colonia, New Jersey. Muni is included in an exhibit display of important disc jockeys at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The DJs at Q104.3 keep Muni's promise to New York listeners and still start their noon hour with the \\"12 o'clock Beatles Block\\". Muni was inducted into the Rock Radio Hall of Fame in the \\"Legends of Rock Radio-Programming\\" category for his work at WNEW in 2014. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2015.

His research has covered many kinds of data communications, particularly wireless communications and optical communications. Foschini has also worked on point-to-point systems and networks. Biography Foschini received the B.S.E.E. degree from the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the M.E.E. degree from New York University and a Ph.D. from the Stevens Institute of Technology. In December 1962, he joined AT&T; Bell Laboratories where he has worked since. He has also taught at Princeton University and Rutgers University. Within the telecommunications engineering field, he is best known for his invention of Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time (BLAST).\\"Radio Blast\\" 19 August 2000 Justin Mullins New Scientist Magazine issue 2252\\"WHAT'S NEXT; Bouncing Signals Push the Limits of Bandwidth\\" IAN AUSTEN January 16, 2003 New York TimesISI Highly Cited Researchers Version 1.1: Foschini, G. J. Thomson Scientific Retrieved on 10 July 2007 This is a scheme for use in wireless communications which recommends the use of multiple antennas at both the transmitter and receiver. By careful allocation of the data to be transmitted to the transmitting antennas, multiple data streams can be transmitted simultaneously within a single frequency band -- the data capacity of the system then grows directly in line with the number of antennas. This represents a significant advance on current, single-antenna systems. Foschini's 1996 paper[1] (not published until 1998), \\"On limits of wireless communications in a fading environment when using multiple antennas\\", played a key role advancing multiple-input multiple-output wireless systems. Shortly after that publication, in a technical memorandum for his employers[2], Foschini introduced the BLAST concept which is one of the most widely examined techniques in wireless communications research today. Among his later contributions, the paper offering a simplified form of the original BLAST architecture, called Vertical BLAST (V-BLAST)[3], has also resulted in intensive international research efforts. In 2002, Bell Laboratories' patent on BLAST was named by MIT's Technology Review Magazine as one of five \\"Patents to watch\\". According to the Institute for Scientific Information Foschini is in the top 0.5% of most widely cited authors. In 2002, Foschini received the Thomas Alva Edison Patent Award, an honor given to New Jersey people who have changed the world with their inventions; he has also received the Bell Labs Inventor's Award, Gold Award and Teamwork Award and holds the titles of \\"Distinguished Member of Staff, Distinguished Inventor\\" in the Laboratories. Before his work on BLAST, Foschini had already been elected a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1986, \\"for contributions to communications theory\\". Foschini received the 2008 IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal \\"For seminal contributions to the science and technology of multiple-antenna wireless communications.\\" In 2009 Foschini was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

She wrote and illustrated seven children's books, including Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel (1939), and The Little House (1943), which won the Caldecott Medal. She also illustrated six books by other authors. Burton founded the textile collective, Folly Cove Designers, in Cape Ann, Massachusetts, which had numerous museum exhibitions. Some of its members' works are held today in the collections of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Massachusetts, the Cape Ann Museum, and New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Biography =Early life and education= Virginia Burton was born in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. As a child, she was called \\"Jinnee.\\" Her mother was Lena Yates, a lyric poet and artist from England whose poetry was first published at age 20.\\"Virginia Lee Burton\\", Gloucester Lyceum & Sawyer Free Library Yates later published children's books under the name Lena Dalkeith.Barbara Elleman, Virginia Lee Burton: A Life in Art, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2002, pp. 7-9 Later, she went by the moniker Jeanne D'Orge. Virginia Burton's father, Alfred E. Burton, married Lena Yates after he had been widowed with two sons. Yates was 30 years his junior. They were married in 1906, having met on a walking trip in France. Notably, Burton's father served as the first Dean of Student Affairs for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1902-1921).MIT History: Office of the MIT Dean for Undergraduate Education and Student Affairs, Library, MIT, 1995-last updated 2013 Alfred Burton had been widowed. Virginia had an older sister, Christine, and younger brother, Alexander Ross Burton in addition to their father's first two sons, Harold Hitz Burton and Felix Arnold Burton. She recounted their boisterous holiday celebrations, and singing, dancing and theatrical productions as children. Harold became an attorney, politician and Supreme Court Justice; and Arnold an architect. When Virginia was about 8 years old, her family moved to San Diego, California, as the New England winters were hard on her mother's health. Her father, close to his retirement in 1921 after 40 years at MIT, took a leave of absence. A year later the family settled 450 miles north in Carmel-by-the-Sea, then a small, artistic community. Burton and her sister took dance and art lessons, performing in local productions. Her parents divorced in 1925, and her father returned to Boston. After attending local schools, Burton won a state scholarship to the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, where she studied both art and dance. Living in Alameda across the bay while attending art school, she used the long commute by train, ferry boat and cable car \\"to train myself in making quick sketches from life and from memory of my unaware fellow passengers.\\"Burton, \\"Early Years\\", Houghton Mifflin. . =Return to East Coast= In 1928, after a year at art school, Burton moved to Boston, Massachusetts, where her father was living. It was also closer to her sister, by then a dancer in New York City, who invited Virginia to join her. Their father broke his leg, and Burton stayed in Boston to help him. She found work as a \\"sketcher\\" for the newspaper, Boston Evening Transcript. (now defunct). For two-and-a-half years, she worked under its drama and music critic. Portraying actors and other performers, she signed her drawings as \\"VleeB\\". In fall 1930, Burton enrolled in a Saturday morning drawing class taught by sculptor and artist George Demetrios at the Boston Museum School. By spring the two artists were married.Burton, Burton, \\"Folly Cove\\", Houghton Mifflin. . For a year, the couple lived in Lincoln, where their first son Aristides (called Ari) was born. They moved to the Folly Cove neighborhood of Gloucester. Their second son Michael was born in nearby Groton on Burton's birthday in 1935.\\"Virginia Lee Burton: Aris & Mike\\", Houghton Mifflin. . Burton said her first published book, Choo Choo (1935), about an anthropomorphic train engine, reflected strategy she learned from reactions to her first book, which was not published: She was known for designing the whole work: design, illustration, typeface, and space. She said first she made her drawings or preliminary sketches, then she wrote the story, as it came first to her in images. Her papers include the \\"numerous preparatory sketches, the reworking of illustrations that had not proven personally satisfactory to [her], and the demands for quality reproduction of the artwork [that] indicate her meticulous attention to detail.\\" Her books were known for their themes of \\"importance of teamwork, environmental awareness, perseverance, and adapting to change while still recognizing the importance of the past.\\" In 1941, Burton founded the textile collective, Folly Cove Designers, in Cape Ann, Massachusetts and designed some of the textiles. Its works were included in arts and crafts exhibitions of the 1940s and 1950s. It reflected the earlier Arts and Crafts Movement of the 19th century, \\"both in its union of design and production and in the formation as a cooperative guild. The linoleum block print designs for domestic items were innovative and unique, bringing recognition and accolades to the group.\\" The group sold some of their textiles to major retailers such as Lord & Taylor, F. Schumacher, Rich's of Atlanta and Skinner Silks. They had 16 museum exhibitions and some of their works are held in the collections of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, and New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. Burton died on October 15, 1968 of lung cancer. =Sons= Aristides Burton Demetrios is a sculptor of figurative and abstract works, ranging from large public commissions to private pieces for gardens. Michael Burton Demetrios was a businessman, leading Marine World Africa in its numerous locations in the United States. Since 1998 he had been president of Intra-Asia, a US company with two amusement parks in China and plans for five additional. Michael died August 5, 2016 in Orlando, Florida.

It is often applied to, though not limited to, trials relating to Holocaust denial in Germany. The criminal code (Strafgesetzbuch) Chapter 7 (Offences against public order), Paragraph 130 (Incitement to hatred) of the Federal Republic of Germany defines when a person is guilty of Volksverhetzung. Constituent elements Incitement of the People (Volksverhetzung) is defined by § 130 (Incitement to hatred) Section 1 of the Criminal Code: =Section 1= On 21 January 2015, changes to the former text of § 130 Sections 2 and 5, with Section 6 becoming Section 7, took effect following European parliament amendments.http://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?startbk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&jumpTo;=bgbl115s0010.pdf#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl115s0010.pdf%27%5D__1438730698018 Neunundvierzigstes Gesetz zur Änderung des Strafgesetzbuches – Umsetzung europäischer Vorgaben zum Sexualstrafrecht. vom 21.01.2015 (in German), p. 11. At present these changes are not reflected in the English translation of § 130 as updated in the original current German § 130. Substantiation Although freedom of speech is mentioned by Article 5 of the Grundgesetz (Germany's constitution), said article basically protects any non-outlawed speech. Restrictions exist, e.g. against personal insults, use of symbols of unconstitutional organizations, or Volksverhetzung. It is a common misconception that Volksverhetzung includes any spreading of Nazism, racist, or other discriminatory ideas. For any hate speech to be punishable as Volksverhetzung, the law requires that said speech be \\"qualified for disturbing public peace\\" either by inciting \\"hatred against parts of the populace\\" or calling for \\"acts of violence or despotism against them\\", or by attacking \\"the human dignity of others by reviling, maliciously making contemptible or slandering parts of the populace\\". Application to offences committed abroad Offences, that are committed in accordance with § 130 of the Criminal Code abroad, whether by German nationals or foreigners, can be pursued as a domestic crime, when they so act, as if they had been committed within the country, affecting the public peace in Germany and violate the human dignity of German citizens. It is sufficient, for example, that criminal content on the Internet, for example in the form of a HTML page, can be accessed from Germany.BGH 1 StR 184/00 – Urteil vom 12. Dezember 2000 Landgericht Mannheim (BGH 1 StR 184/00 - Judgment of 12 December 2000 District Court of Mannheim, in German Hence, for example, the jurisdiction of German courts can be applied for offences of sedition (Volksverhetzungsdelikte) committed abroad. Such an example, was the conviction of the Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel by the District Court of Mannheim in February 2007, who was convicted of inciting propaganda, that he had published from the US and Canada on the Internet. History Historically, the \\"Karlsbader Beschlüsse\\" of the German Confederation under Austria and led by Metternich included democratic ideals as well as agitation for one, unified German state as Volksverhetzung. Similar laws in other countries Similar laws exist around the world, for instance: * In Austria, Verhetzung is a criminal offense with similar legal elements under section 283 of the Penal Code. * In the UK, incitement to ethnic or racial hatred is a criminal offense under Sections 17–29 of the Public Order Act 1986. * In Ireland, the corresponding law is the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act. * A similar law exists in Sweden as \\"hets mot folkgrupp\\" (\\"agitation against a population group\\"), second section 16th chapter 8§ of the criminal code.https://www.government.se/government- policy/judicial-system/the-swedish-criminal-code/ * The Finnish criminal code also includes a similar law, which calls the crime \\"kiihottaminen kansanryhmää vastaan\\" (\\"incitement against ethnic groups\\") in the Finnish version, \\"hets mot folkgrupp\\" in the Swedish version: 11th chapter (\\"On War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity\\"), 8§. * The Russian Criminal Code such a law called the \\"incitement of ethnic hatred\\", which refers to actions aimed at inciting ethnic or racial hatred (Article 282 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).

The largest single part of the FAR is Part 52, which contains standard solicitation provisions and contract clauses. Solicitation provisions are certification requirements, notices, and instructions directed at firms that might be interested in competing for a specific contract. These provisions and clauses are of six types: (i) required solicitation provisions; (ii) required-when-applicable solicitation provisions; (iii) optional solicitation provisions; (iv) required contract clauses; (v) required-when-applicable contract clauses; and (vi) optional contract clauses.\\" (2012). If the FAR requires that a clause be included in a government contract, but that clause is omitted, case law may provide that the missing clause is deemed to be included. This is known as the Christian Doctrine, which is based on the underlying principle that certain government regulations have the force and effect of law,See Davies Precision Machining, Inc. v. U.S., (1995) and government personnel may not deviate from the law without proper authorization. Prospective contractors are presumed to know the law, including the limits of the authority of government personnel. Thus, a mandatory clause that expresses a significant or deeply ingrained strand of public procurement policy will be incorporated into a Government contract by operation of law, even if the parties intentionally omitted it. A contract award can be challenged and set aside if a protester can prove that either the contracting agency or the contract awardee did not comply with the requirements of the solicitation. A successful protest can result in reconsideration of the decision to award the contract or award of the contract to the protester in lieu of the original awardee. Even though a successful protester may not ultimately be awarded the contract, the government agency may have to pay the protester's bid and proposal costs.  Structure  The Federal Acquisition Regulation is contained within Chapter 1 of Title 48 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).48 CFR Table of Contents, vol. 1 p. 1 (2010). Chapter 1 is divided into Subchapters A-H, which encompass Parts 1-53. Chapter 1 appears in two volumes, with Subchapters A-G appearing in Volume 1 while Subchapter H occupies all of Volume 2.48 CFR 1 Table of Contents, vol. 1 p. 3-4 (2010).48 CFR 1 Table of Contents, vol. 2. p. 3 (2010). The volumes are not formal subdivisions of Title 48, but refer instead to the fact that the FAR is printed by the Government Printing Office in two volumes for convenience. The single most heavily regulated aspect of acquisition is contract pricing, which is addressed throughout the FAR, but especially in Subpart 15.4, Parts 30 and 31, and Subparts 42.7, 42.8, and 42.17. A large part of the FAR, Subchapter D, describes various socio-economic programs, such as the various small business programs, purchases from foreign sources, and laws written to protect laborers and professionals working under government contracts. The final three chapters of Title 48 (61, 63 and 99) establish the Civilian Board of Contract Appeals, the Department of Transportation Board of Contract Appeals, and the Cost Accounting Standards Board, respectively. The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals has been established by charter within the Department of Defense. The proper way to cite a regulation within the FAR is by part, subpart, section, subsection, without respect to chapter or subchapter. (2012). For instance, the FAR rule on legislative lobbying costs is found at FAR Part 31, Section 205, Subsection 22 (cited as \\"FAR 31.205-22\\"). The table of contents, as of the edition published October 1, 2012, is available. = Supplements = As the original purpose of the FAR was to consolidate the numerous individual agency regulations into one comprehensive set of standards which would apply government-wide, the issuance of supplemental regulations is closely governed by the FAR. Nearly every major cabinet-level department (and many agencies below them) has issued such regulations, which often place further restrictions or requirements on contractors and contracting officers. One of the best-known examples of an agency supplement is the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), used by the Department of Defense, which constitutes Chapter 2. Chapter 3 is the Department of Health and Human Services Acquisition Regulation; Chapter 4 is the Department of Agriculture's Acquisition Regulation; etc. The required format for agency FAR supplements is to follow the basic FAR format. To continue the example above, the supplemental DFARS section on legislative lobbying costs is DFARS Subpart 231, Section 205, Subsection 22 (cited as \\"DFARS 231.205-22\\").  Provisions  = Deviations = FAR Subpart 1.4, Deviations from the FAR, provides the steps needed to document deviations from the mandatory FAR or agency FAR supplement. Deviation documentation is needed if there is a precise FAR clause or provision for the issue. FAR 12.401 allows Commercial Items contracts to be tailored to a great extent, therefore deviating in many particulars from the mandatory clause language. See also FAR 12.211, Technical Data; FAR 12.212, Computer Software; FAR 12.213, Other Commercial Practices for additional authority to deviate or \\"tailor\\" FAR clauses and provisions in the context of commercial items/services. = Ratifications = A ratification is the proper authorization by a contracting officer of an earlier procurement by a Government employee who was not authorized to do it. A ratification package has a legal memo that says an unauthorized commitment was made, that the commitment could properly have been done by contracting officers, and that funds were and are available for it. Other regulations and agency rules apply too, such as those from the Army discussed below. Ratifications are governed by FAR 1.602-3 (Ratification of Unauthorized Commitment) which defines a ratification as the act of approving an unauthorized commitment by an official who has the authority to do so.FAR 1.602-3 paragraph (a) Unauthorized commitment means an agreement that is not binding solely because the Government representative who made it lacked the authority to enter into that agreement on behalf of the Government. A ratifying official may ratify only when: (1) The Government has received the goods or services; (2) The ratifying official has authority to obligate the United States, and had that authority at the time of the unauthorized commitment; (3) The resulting contract would otherwise be proper, i.e., adequate funds are available, the contract is not prohibited by law, the ratification is in accordance with agency procedures, etc.; (4) The contracting officer determines that the price paid was fair and reasonable and recommends payment, and legal counsel concurs.FAR 1.602-3(c) There are dollar limits to the authority to ratify unauthorized commitments. A Chief of Contracting Office can approve up to $10,000. A Principal Assistant Responsible for Contracting can approve up to $100,000. A Head of Contracting Authority can approve higher amounts.FAR 1.602-3(a)(2) through (3) and AFARS 5101.602-3(b) Ratifications in the U.S. Army call for a signed statement describing the unauthorized commitment, the value of the procurement, and other documentation. Then a contracting officer is to study the case and recommend action. If the procurement is not ratified, the matter may be handled under FAR Part 50 and DFARS Part 250 (Public Law 85-804) as a GAO claim or some other way.From the Army FAR Supplement: AFARS 5101.602-3-90—Ratification Procedures = Contractor damage = FAR Part 45 provides rules on the Contractor's obligations and the Government's remedies in these cases. Specific clauses should be in the contract to deal with Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) situations and bring your own device (BYOD) situations. = Commercial items = The authority under FAR Part 12, Commercial Items (and services), must be used thoughtfully and carefully. It is very tempting for a contracting officer to use FAR Part 12 and hence FAR Part 13 in situations where such use is clearly not appropriate in view of the basic reasons commercial item acquisition authority was created by Congress. FAR 2.101 provides that > a commercial item means – (6) services of a type offered and sold > competitively in substantial quantities in the commercial marketplace based > on established catalog or market prices for specific tasks performed or > specific outcomes to be achieved and under standard commercial terms and > conditions. This does not include services that are sold based on hourly > rates without an established catalog or market price for a specific service > performed or specific outcomes to be achieved. For purposes of these > services – (i)catalog price means a price included in a catalog, price list, > schedule or other form that is regularly maintained by the manufacturer or > vendor, is either published or otherwise available for inspection by > customers and states prices at which sales are currently, or were last, made > to a significant number of buyers constituting the general public; and (ii) > Market prices mean current prices that are established in the course of > ordinary trade between buyers and sellers free to bargain and that can be > substantiated through competition or from sources independent of the > offerors. Note the emphasis in the FAR 2.101 definition for commercial items on established market prices. The reason why Simplified Acquisition Procedures are permitted for items above the $250,000https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/Policy_Initiatives/Class%20Deviation%202018-01%20MPT%20and%20SAT%20Increase.pdf simplified acquisition threshold for commercial items is there is an efficient market pricing mechanism which pressures market participants to provide goods and services at a fair and reasonable price which represents very efficient / non-wasteful pricing mechanisms. Generally, the more efficient and well- developed markets have a large number of participating vendors and information is freely available to consumers in that market on the relative merits of each vendor's products and pricing which permits easy comparison of each vendor's products to each other. FAR Part 12 commercial items acquisition authority was intended to take advantage of the WalMart's (R) and Microsoft's (R) of the world where there is no need to go through the extensive, formalistic and resource/ time-consuming process of a fully negotiated procurement, which requires vendors provide cost and pricing information, to verify a fair and reasonable price. In other words, FAR Part 12 was intended to increase the number of competitors available to the US Government by jettisoning all of the unique requirements, including cost accounting systems, which are forced upon Federal contractors by acquisition processes such as FAR Parts 14, 15, 36 etc.; instead, the Federal Government could act more like a normal buyer in a fully functioning commercial market where the Government was but one of a large number of consumers seeking the same or highly similar products or services. However, FAR Part 12 was never intended to apply where the US Government was the only or one of a very few buyers for an item or service not in demand by the commercial market place. What happens when there are very few market participants and the goods or services are not widely available to the public? Let's take surveillance systems in a military overseas contingency environment as an example. Battlefield full motion video is not something that is found in the commercial sector – Wal-Marts don't sell this; moreover, frequently there are special restrictions which impact on commercial firms ability to engage in work of this nature. For example, special FAA Administrator permission is required before a US certificated aircraft or pilot can fly in Iraq under Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 77; if there are very few, or only one, vendor who can participate in this requirement, there are no vendors out there for meaningful competition which is the bedrock assumption of FAR Parts 12 and 13. In view of the above, the airborne recon contract is NOT a commercial service – therefore the use of FAR Part 12 commercial items contracting processes is wholly inappropriate and not permissible under the applicable laws governing Federal acquisition. Taking another example, what happens when significant research and development is needed to adopt a commercial item for Government use? Should FAR Parts 12 and 13 be used here? Absolutely not. There are no market pricing mechanisms for the non-standard variant – the Government is the only buyer of this particular variant of the commercially available item. What about situations where Government demand overwhelms the commercial markets supply? In this case, the Government is actually competing against itself because it has swallowed the market whole and usually has multiple requiring activities competing against each other for the same goods and services. This is exemplified in cases where numerous contracting offices demand the same goods and services unknowingly are driving prices up against each other. Frequently in these case, contracting commands accept take-it or leave-it prices from relatively few vendors (compared to demand) who know that these contracting offices are not coordinating amongst each other or establishing commodity control councils to ration demand against the civilian sources of supply. As the US Federal Reserve will attest to, inflation is one of the most damaging elements in an economic system to investment, capital markets and economic activity. In this case, the effect of driving massive cost inflation directly impacts civilians and non-Government consumers who are also competing for the same goods and services against the US Government acquisition commands; ultimately the deep pockets of the Government win out against the lesser buying power of the non- governmental market participants. In such cases, as the US Government did during World War II, commodity control councils must be established to identify all available sources of supply and ration supply to the various consumers, including US Government consumers, sometimes with price controls (although this is very dangerous because it frequently leads to black markets run by criminals). One solution in this case is to identify markets unaffected by the Government demand and seek to acquire goods and services through that other market. When the situation of overwhelming government demand occurs in a faltering or damaged economy, Government demand that is in excess of what the local vendors can supply to both Government and non-Government consumers should be met by vendors who operate out of the market in question, including through the GSA Schedule system if the damaged market is outside of the United States. Resources and expertise are in the Federal Government that are designed to assist in cases where Federal demand overwhelms civilian supply, one example being the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF). The ICAF's charter is to maintain the ability to nationalize an economy to achieve strategic objectives or a wartime mobilization, this is a good resource expertise in this particular area. Use of FAR Parts 12 and 13 without rationing of demand through a single commodity control council or finding other solutions is likely to create more problems than it solves. Non- commercial contracting methodology and clauses should be used for any acquisition where Government demand overwhelms civilian supply. It is highly unlikely there will be any cost controls or a fair and reasonable price obtained for non-commercial services or goods obtained using FAR Parts 12 and FAR 13 under these circumstances. =Unsolicited proposals= Sub-part 15.6 covers unsolicited proposals, i.e. business proposals offering new and innovative ideas outside the context of innovative proposals invited and offered within a government-initiated procurement procedure. The regulations suggest the executive agencies make provision for acceptance of unsolicited proposals and for prior contact with individuals or organisations contemplating submission of such a proposal.FAR Sub-part 15.6 = Service Contracts = Special rules apply to service contracts. They must be performance-based to the extent practicable, with measurable outcomes. FAR 37.102 and FAR Part 37.6 describe performance-based methods. FAR 37.601 has specific requirements for performance work statements (PWS) for service contracts requiring performance-based standards. Agency supplements also require performance-based acquisitions. (See, e.g., DFARS 237.170 Approval of contracts and task orders for services; DFARS 237.170-2 Approval requirements.) Performance Based Service Acquisition (PBSA) is a process and way of defining requirements that yields well written work statements that are outcome oriented and measurable thus enforceable. Deming/Six Sigma style quality assessments and process analysis can help define performance work statements. A Performance Work Statement (PWS) has: * An outcome-based definition of the service deliverable * Performance standards that are measurable * A plan for measuring and evaluating performance * A matrix of related services i.e., generator maintenance, that has subsets of services underneath them The DOD PBSA guide has a \\"performance requirements summary\\" matrix which can serve as an outline for work statement provisions.Guidebook for Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) in the Department of Defense. Dec. 2000 Army Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Supplement (AFARS) has an outline for performance-based service contracts. Additional Resources for PBSA: * Office of Management and Budget, Office of Federal Procurement Policy, Performance Based Service Acquisition * Army Material Command PBSA site * NASA * Defense Acquisition University – Performance-based services acquisition links and templates * The Guidebook for Performance-Based Services Acquisition (PBSA) in the Department of Defense December 2000 is an outstanding resource with many examples and ideas * Army Material Command (AMC) Pamphlet 715-17, Guide for Preparation and Use of Performance Based Specifications * Interactive Internet presentation on performance-based services acquisition * Air Force Instruction 63-124, Performance-Based Services Acquisition The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) has a Draft Best Practices Guide on Contractor Performance = Personal Services Contracts = The term \\"personal services contract\\" means a contract with express terms or administration which makes the contractor personnel appear effectively to be Government employees. Such contracts are prohibited by the FAR (subpart 37.104) excepting where specifically authorized by statute. * Contractors are NOT employees – no remedies under personnel law and no remedies under contract law if vague/badly written work statements used * Inherent governmental restrictions (See OMB Circular A-76) and FAR Part 37 * FAR Subpart 9.5 Organizational Conflicts of Interest Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCIE) problems \\"Nonpersonal services contract\\" means a contract under which the personnel rendering the services are not subject, either by the contract's terms or by the manner of its administration, to the supervision and control usually prevailing in relationships between the Government and its employees. Advisory and assistance services (A&AS;) are permissible (See FAR Subpart 37.2) Personal services are NOT permissible (See FAR 37.104 and Classification Act) without specific authority to obtain such services (meaning statutory authority) Permissible to acquire expert and consultant services (5 USC 3109 or 10 USC 129b – expert services) or 10 USC 1091 – health services), as well as health services, intelligence, counter intelligence or special operations command operations requirements under DFARS 237.104, Personal Services Contracts and 10 USC 129b – Contracting must do a determination and finding (D&F;) (per FAR Subpart 1.7 and DFARS Subpart 237.104) for this DFARS 237.170-2 forbids non- performance-based contracts unless exception done under DFARS 237.170-2 If an agency is hiring experts, read over 5 USC 3109, Employment of Experts and Consultants, Temporary or Intermittent to see if it applies to FAR 37.104(f). Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has established requirements that apply in acquiring personal services for experts or consultants in this manner (for example, benefits, taxes, conflicts of interest), \\"therefore, the contracting officer shall effect necessary coordination with the cognizant civilian personnel office.\\" Note that personal service contracts are potentially subject to salary caps \\"Inherently Governmental Functions\\"Federal Acquisition Regulation, Subpart 7.5, Inherently Governmental Functions may not be performed by contractors other than a specific Personal Services Contract under the authority of P.L. 86-36 or 5 USC 3109. Inherently Governmental Functions are defined by P.L. 105-270 (FAIR Act of 1998) as a function so intimately related to the public interest as to require performance by Federal Government employees. These involve the exercise of discretion in applying Federal Government authority or making a value judgement in decisions for the Federal Government, such as monetary transactions and entitlements, determination of agency policy or program priorities, and hiring or direction of Federal employees. See also 10 USC 2331 Procurement of services: contracts for professional and technical services and AFARS 5137.104—Personal Services Contracts. See also agency regulations on specific prohibitions on use of service contractors for inherently governmental activities under OMB Circular A-76, for example, Army Regulation (AR) 735-5, para 2-11 sets out those property accountability tasks which can and cannot be performed by contractors. (Basically, contractors may not exercise any discretionary authority.) Examples of prohibited personal services: * Clerical/administrative/secretarial support to Government personnel * Technical/Managerial performance of same or similar jobs performed by Government personnel * Any contractor personnel working in a Government facility and supervised/directed by Government = Health Care = Special acquisitions rules and laws govern acquisition of health or medical related services. For example, DoD Instruction (DoDI) 6025.5, Personal Services Contracts (PSCS) for Health Care Providers (HCPS) has extensive requirements that must be addressed in any DoD health care contract. DoD 6025.18-R, DoD Health Information Privacy Regulation also has substantial mandates concerning medical records as well as HIPAA compliance. See http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/blaw/dodd/corres/html/602518r.htm Military service regulations also deal with this issue extensively: for example, See AR 40-400 Medical Support Provisions – Authority = Intellectual Property (IP) / Data Rights / Technical Data Rights = From the Government perspective, the most critical aspect of IP, data, technical data and patent rights revolve around freedom to operate and freedom of contract, namely freedom to have maximum competition. From the perspective of a contractor, the most critical aspect of this area is protection of competitive advantage from disclosure to its competitors. In other words, the contractor/commercial vendor wants to retain its ability to have a product to sell – inherent in this desire is a need to prevent the Government from disclosing important technical data, e.g., engineering designs, schematics, specifications, to its competitors when the Government conducts a follow-on acquisition and attempts to seek competition to meet legal and policy mandates in the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) and Armed Services Procurement Act. IP, data rights and technical data rights is a highly specialized practice area in Federal acquisitions. Careful examination of FAR Part 27 and applicable agency FAR supplements (for example, DFARS 227) must be performed and consultation with a wide variety of Federal statutes accomplished before attempting to deal with IP/data/technical data. A number of variables drive allocation and use of IP/data/technical data including whether or not the subject of the contract is for research and development (R&D;), small business/non-profit or non-small business/for- profit, source of funds used to create the IP in question (exclusively private, exclusively Government or mixed funds), acquisition of commercial or non-commercial items/services and whether software or non-software is being acquired. Additional clauses must be added to the acquisition for patent/data/technical data and specific CLINs must be added for data/technical data deliverables per the FAR/DFAR. Various agency regulations separately deal with technical data acquisition as well and must be consulted. There is a difference between FAR and agency supplements. For example, the FAR focuses on \\"data\\" while the DFAR provisions focus on the narrower subset of \\"technical data\\". For technical data, DFARS 227.7102-3(b) states \\"Use the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data--Noncommercial Items, in lieu of the clause at 252.227-7015 if the Government will pay any portion of the development costs. ...\\" Thus, the Government would not be using that clause if it was not paying some portion of development costs – the question is whether or not this particular item's development costs were in fact paid for by the Government. It is prudent to make this determination up front in the CLIN structure of a contract for technical data deliverables. There are different categories of technical data which are addressed in different sections of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Supplement (DFARS). These main categories are technical data (defined not to include specific categories as called out in this list), software, and SBIR technical data. Technical data and software each are subdivided into two additional sub categories, commercial and non-commercial. Separate treatment and clauses are provided for each sub-category. Generally, there are specific issues which must be addressed in any technical data rights or software acquisition, which include: \\\\- Required contract clauses and provisions (driven by the below categories) (commercial versus non-commercial; software vs non-software; SIBR versus non- SBIR; technical and scientific information versus non-technical and non- scientific information; and special cases discussed in DFARS 227) \\\\- Disclosure of technical data use restrictions as a part of the offer / proposal (for example, DFARS 252.227.7017 clause) \\\\- Markings provisions (includes basic markings clause plus challenge clause) \\\\- Required contract line item numbers (CLIN) structure (broken out for each category/type which are segregable – must be specifically expanded upon in the work statement / contract specifications; each CLIN must be separately priced; this is NOT THE CDRLS. CDRLS are separate.) It is absolutely critical that both contracting and the requiring activity both understand the categories and subcategories of technical data as well as data. A basic understanding of the patent rights clauses are also necessary. Both technical data (and/or data) AND the patent rights clauses must be included as they are completely separate from each other. Accordingly, it is important to understand your requirement and whether or not the acquisition or the deliverables fit into these categories because it drives acquisition planning and required clauses and provisions that must be inserted into the solicitation. It is normal for MULTIPLE contract clauses and provisions to be inserted into the contract solicitation for the acquisition of a SINGLE CATEGORY of technical data (for example, DFARS 7013, Non-Commercial Technical Data, and 7017 clauses). However, it is important to note that if multiple categories of technical data (or even FAR data) is to be acquired, multiple categories of technical data clauses must be inserted and each contract line item number (CLIN) must be specifically drafted to cover each separate CATEGORY of technical data (e.g., commercial AND separately non- commercial software) Technical data for DoD contracts is defined at the DFARS 252.227.7013 clause, paragraph a, subparagraph (14): \\"\\"Technical data\\" means recorded information, regardless of the form or method of the recording, of a scientific or technical nature (including computer software documentation). The term does not include computer software or data incidental to contract administration, such as financial and/or management information.\\" There are separate clauses for software (commercial and non-commercial). The two standards technical data rights clauses in the FAR are the DFARS 252.227.7013 (non-commercial technical data) and the 252.227.7015 (commercial technical data) – neither of which covers software or software documentation. Non- commercial software and its documentation are covered by the DFARS 252.227.7014 clause. Commercial software acquisitions are dealt with only briefly at DFARS 227.7202 which essentially says that the Government shall get the rights customarily obtained by customers in the relevant software market, the Government shall obtain the minimum rights necessary for the Government's purposes, and that the Government cannot force the commercial vendor to give up rights. The Government cannot issue a unilateral modification forcing delivery of rights in computer software; mutual consent is mandated by law and DFARS provisions for commercial software acquisitions. The contract clause that is normally in a commercial software contract acquisition is the FAR 52.212-4, Commercial Items, clause. This clause mirrors the above intent which states that the Government will have rights provided to the normal consumer in that particular market, which in reality are defined by a separate software license. Licenses for software routinely have provisions which are illegal in Government contracts. In particular, see FAR 12.304 for the provisions of the 52.212-4 clause which may be tailored and which ones that may not as well as some provisions that may NEVER be in a Government contract except under very specific circumstances (for example, indemnification agreements, provisions which require the Government to give up control of litigation (usually for patent infringement lawsuits against the Government/licensee, invoicing, and remedies). Separately, examine the 52.212-4 clause as well as the software license and determine if they have provisions which either overlap or contradict each other. If so, then the two will have to be reconciled – essentially, the license will have to be rewritten to address any conflict with a provision which tells which one will control – either the license or the 52.212-4 clause. The broader category of know-how, etc. is covered by the \\"data\\" provisions of the FAR. Note that DFARS part 227 scope provision requires that DOD use the DFARS 227 provisions rather than the FAR 27 provisions. However, it is important to remember that the FAR data provisions include both \\"data\\" and \\"technical data\\". The scope section is inartfully drafted because a literal reading would compel use of clauses which are specifically limited to scientific and technical information – you have to use the much broader FAR clauses to go after \\"data\\" which is not scientific or technical information. DFARS 227.7103-1, Policy, para (c) says that \\"Offerors shall not be required ... to sell or otherwise relinquish to the Government any rights in technical data related to items, components or processes developed at private expense solely because the Government's rights to use, modify, release, reproduce, perform, display, or disclose technical data pertaining to those items may be restricted.\\" HOWEVER, the Government may include a source selection criteria which rates offers more favorably or higher which provide desired technical data rights. A detailed discussion of intellectual property in Government contracts can be found in a variety of sources, including Intellectual Property in Government Contracts by Ralph C. Nash, Jr. and Leonard Rawicz published by CCH/Wolters Kluwer, as well as Licensing Software and Technology to the U.S. Government: the Complete Guide to Rights to Intellectual Property in Prime Contracts and Subcontracts. However, note that neither of these books provide a nuts and bolts explanation on how to deal with commercial computer software licenses as discussed above. These books provide a high level discussion of the law and regulations, history and policy involved, which is useful. Categories of Technical Data Rights: DFARS 227.7103-4 License rights [Non-commercial items] provides the standard license rights that a licensor grants to the Government are (1) unlimited rights, (2) Government purpose rights, or (3) limited rights. Those rights are defined in the clause at 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data—Noncommercial Items. Technical information developed exclusively with Government funds may be used by the Government without restriction including going to another contractor to produce the item in question. A second technical data rights scenario occurs when items/technical data is acquired using mixed funding – the Government gets Government purpose rights which allow the Government to go with another vendor provided a non disclosure agreement is signed with that other vendor and any tech data/drawings produced under that other contract are marked in accordance with the DFARS 252.227.7013 clause. If the technical data was developed exclusively at private expense, the Government has limited rights. That means the rights to use, modify, and disclose the data within the Government. But it generally may not, without permission, release the data outside of the Government. DFARS 252.227-7013. Contractors in the Government Workplace – OMB Circular A-76 Public – Private Competitions, Inherently Governmental Work (not permitted to be performed by a contractor) and Federal Trade Secret Act (FTSA) Impacts on Use of Contractors: In other areas, problems frequently arise when Federal activities hire support contractors to assist them with executing their mission. These contracts frequently come into at least potential conflict with rules governing permissible use of contractors, such as rules against use of contractors for inherently governmental functions (See OMB Circular A-76) and rules against personal services (see above). One of the most serious problems can occur when a contractor is put into a position where they can see private party trade secrets, proprietary information or other contractor's proprietary information. The Federal Trade Secret Act (18 USC 1905) imposes criminal, civil and administrative sanctions on Federal employees who with knowledge allow proprietary, confidential or trade secret information to be used for an unauthorized purpose, including permitting other Federal contractors to view the proprietary information in question. Given the overwhelming reliance on support contractors, it is now necessary to address this question of authorized use under the Federal Trade Secret Act. A simple solution is to include in the CLIN structure a statement, such as for example, \\"the Government may provide proprietary information received under this contract to support contractors provided no organizational conflict of interest occurs under FAR Subpart 9.5, the support contractor is not directly competing on the acquisition in question which originated the proprietary information in question and a non-disclosure agreement with each contractor recipient is accomplished requiring the contractor ensure such proprietary information is not disclosed outside of the Government activity handling the proprietary information.\\" In this way, the contract that is the entry point for such proprietary information being handled by US Government support contractors includes an explicit authorization which avoids violation of the Federal Trade Secret Act provisions relating to authorized versus unauthorized use. The DFARS includes a non-disclosure agreement at DFARS 227.7103-7, para c, which can be used in this case. Markings: Markings are critically important technical/proprietary data to manage in a Government contract. See: * DFARS 252.227-7025 (Limitations on the Use or Disclosure of Government-Furnished Information Marked with Restrictive Legends), * FAR 27.404(h) – Unauthorized marking of data – discusses the marking provisions of FAR clause 52.227-14 * DFARS 252.227-7017, Identification and Assertion of Use, Release or Disclosure Restrictions (Great clause to include for marking requirements, along with 52.227-14 clause) * Markings also covered in DFARS clause 252.227-7013, Rights in Technical Data – Noncommercial Items, para (f) * FAR 27.404(i) Omitted or incorrect notices – states that data delivered under a contract with FAR clause 52.227-14 without restricted markings/legends will be presumed to have been delivered with unlimited rights and the government assumes no liability for disclosure of such data. Contracts which include technical data should include a markings section to ensure a contractor properly marks proprietary information and the Government protects it accordingly. Patent rights are determined and dealt with separately from technical data and data rights. By default the Government owns (\\"receives title to\\") any invention first created, prototyped, or put into practice in the performance of a Government contract. (The patent law term is \\"reduced to practice\\".) Thus if an inventor designed something, convinced the Government to buy it, then created it for the first time in the performance of the contract, the Government takes title of it. The patent rights clause can specify that the contractor gets title or a license to the invention if the contractor follows some procedures within a specified time span and commercializes the invention or at least provides a commercialization plan. = Brand names = FAR 11.104, Use of Brand Name or Equal Purchase Descriptions discusses acceptable uses of brand names in solicitations and how to do this. FAR 11.105 Items Peculiar to One Manufacturer states \\"agency requirements shall not be written so as to require a particular brand name or product or a feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company, unless: * (a) the particular name brand, product or feature is essential to the Government's requirements and market research indicates other companies similar products or products lacking the particular feature do not meet, or cannot be modified to meet, the agency's needs. * (b) the authority to contract without providing for full and open competition is supported by the required justification and approvals (See 6.302-1); and * (c) the basis for not providing maximum practical competition is documented in the file when acquisition is awarded using simplified acquisition procedures.\\" = Clauses for Government contracts = * Government contracts have mandatory clauses that must be included in a contract document. The FAR and DFARS have prescribing sections in them and the FAR has a table which can be used to determine required, as applicable or optional clauses by subject matter * FAR 52.301 clause matrix – right clauses for the category, e.g., supplies, services, construction or commercial items and Options? IDIQ? Contract TYPE (see FAR Part 16) (i.e., fixed price (FP), FP with economic price adjustment, cost-reimbursement, incentive, time and materials, IDIQ, letter contracts, agreements under FAR Subpart 16.7, etc.). Note in FAR 52.301 that a clause must be in both the contract and the solicitation but provisions are only in solicitations. Contracting activities are at unequal stages of transitioning to automated contract generation tools which have a menu driven system which generates the contract with appropriate clauses. However, frequently contracting officers do not have sufficient knowledge that some optional or required clause is applicable in a particular case – especially for intellectual property or other specialized acquisitions. With the transition to the automated systems, many contracting officers do not possess the knowledge to prepare a manual contract without the automated tool. Also, the automated systems frequently do not allow inclusion of various non standard work statement, instructions or clauses due to limitations on input options.

It is located to the west of the city centre, and covers parts of the suburbs Bradmore, Compton, Finchfield, Merridale, Newbridge and Whitmore Reans. It borders the St Peter's, Graiseley, Merry Hill, Tettenhall Wightwick and Tettenhall Regis wards. It forms part of the Wolverhampton South West constituency. Geography Its name comes from the fact that two of the city's main parks, West Park and Bantock Park, lie within its boundaries. Two of the city's main thoroughfares are contained largely within the ward, namely the A41 Tettenhall Road and the Compton Road (A454). The Halfway House on Tettenhall Road was formerly a coaching house on the London to Holyhead route and as the name suggests, was the halfway point. It was a pub for many years but and closed (2009) to reopen as a pharmacy. Main sights Park contains the Chapel Ash conservation area and also the Parkdale conservation area. Some other interesting architecture can be seen within the ward, particularly on the Tettenhall Road, such as first Mayor of Wolverhampton, George Thorneycroft's House. Economy The ward contains the Marstons Park Brewery, one of the city's main employers. Other employers in the ward tend to be office or school based but there are also a number of well-known pubs and restaurants. The city's now closed Eye Infirmary was located at the top of Compton Road in Chapel Ash, the site is now awaiting redevelopment as is the nearby site of the old Quarterhouse pub, now demolished. Education Also inside Park ward are a number of schools, including Wolverhampton Grammar School, Wolverhampton Girls' High School, St Peter's Collegiate School and St Edmund's Catholic Academy, as well as numerous Primary schools.

It was the first module designed for use with the Forgotten Realms campaign setting and officially labeled as such. Plot summary Under Illefarn is a scenario designed for beginning players in the Forgotten Realms setting. The player characters are residents of the town of Daggerford, and are therefore automatically members of the town militia and thus required to deal with local perils, such as fighting lizardmen raiders, rescuing a kidnapped noblewoman, and guarding a caravan. The module describes Daggerford and its personalities, as well as the nearby dwarf and orc lairs of Illefarn. Daggerford is fairly quiet for a frontier town. Sure, lizard men raid the local baron's holding now and then, orcs sneak out of the Misty Forest to raid caravans on the Trade Way, and lady Bronwyn has a few suitors who are a touch too passionate, but there's nothing going on that a member of the renowned Daggerford militia can't handle. Except that the Shining River has turned green, the cattle are dying. Except that the Elf King of Laughing Hollow, a place where no human dares to go without fearing for his life, is asking the militia for help. Except that strange substances are oozing from the fissures caused by a recent earthquake. Except that the earthquake also has opened an entrance in the cliffs around Laughing Hollow that might lead to the fabled dwarf mines of Illefarn. Suddenly, being a militiaman isn't quite as easy as it used to be...

If the force of the impact is excessive, the bone may fracture at or near the site of the impact and cause damage to the underlying structures within the skull such as the membranes, blood vessels, and brain. While an uncomplicated skull fracture can occur without associated physical or neurological damage and is in itself usually not clinically significant, a fracture in healthy bone indicates that a substantial amount of force has been applied and increases the possibility of associated injury. Any significant blow to the head results in a concussion, with or without loss of consciousness. A fracture in conjunction with an overlying laceration that tears the epidermis and the meninges, or runs through the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear structures, bringing the outside environment into contact with the cranial cavity is called a compound fracture. Compound fractures can either be clean or contaminated. There are four major types of skull fractures: linear, depressed, diastatic, and basilar. Linear fractures are the most common, and usually require no intervention for the fracture itself. Depressed fractures are usually comminuted, with broken portions of bone displaced inward—and may require surgical intervention to repair underlying tissue damage. Diastatic fractures widen the sutures of the skull and usually affect children under three. Basilar fractures are in the bones at the base of the skull. Types =Linear fracture= Linear skull fractures are breaks in the bone that transverse the full thickness of the skull from the outer to inner table. They are usually fairly straight with no bone displacement. The common cause of injury is blunt force trauma where the impact energy transferred over a wide area of the skull. Linear skull fractures are usually of little clinical significance unless they parallel in close proximity or transverse a suture, or they involve a venous sinus groove or vascular channel. The resulting complications may include suture diastasis, venous sinus thrombosis, and epidural hematoma. In young children, although rare, the possibility exists of developing a growing skull fracture especially if the fracture occurs in the parietal bone. =Depressed fracture= Depressed skull fracture. A depressed skull fracture is a type of fracture usually resulting from blunt force trauma, such as getting struck with a hammer, rock or getting kicked in the head. These types of fractures—which occur in 11% of severe head injuries—are comminuted fractures in which broken bones displace inward. Depressed skull fractures present a high risk of increased pressure on the brain, or a hemorrhage to the brain that crushes the delicate tissue. Compound depressed skull fractures occur when there is a laceration over the fracture, putting the internal cranial cavity in contact with the outside environment, increasing the risk of contamination and infection. In complex depressed fractures, the dura mater is torn. Depressed skull fractures may require surgery to lift the bones off the brain if they are pressing on it by making burr holes on the adjacent normal skull.Singh J and Stock A. 2006. \\"Head Trauma.\\" Emedicine.com. Retrieved on January 26, 2007. =Diastatic fracture= Cranial abnormalities in cleidocranial dysplasia including diastatic sutures. Diastatic fractures occur when the fracture line transverses one or more sutures of the skull causing a widening of the suture. While this type of fracture is usually seen in infants and young children as the sutures are not yet fused it can also occur in adults. When a diastatic fracture occurs in adults it usually affects the lambdoidal suture as this suture does not fully fuse in adults until about the age of 60. Most adult diastatic fractures are caused by severe head injuries. Due to the trauma, diastatic fracture occurs with the collapse of the surrounding head bones. It crushes the delicate tissue, similarly to a depressed skull fracture. Diastatic fractures can occur with different types of fractures and it is also possible for diastasis of the cranial sutures to occur without a concomitant fracture. Sutural diastasis may also occur in various congenital disorders such as cleidocranial dysplasia and osteogenesis imperfecta. =Basilar fracture= Superior view of the skull base. Basilar skull fractures are linear fractures that occur in the floor of the cranial vault (skull base), which require more force to cause than other areas of the neurocranium. Thus they are rare, occurring as the only fracture in only 4% of severe head injury patients. Basilar fractures have characteristic signs: blood in the sinuses; cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (CSF leaking from the nose) or from the ears (cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea); periorbital ecchymosis often called 'raccoon eyes' (bruising of the orbits of the eyes that result from blood collecting there as it leaks from the fracture site); and retroauricular ecchymosis known as \\"Battle's sign\\" (bruising over the mastoid process). =Growing fracture= A growing skull fracture (GSF) also known as a craniocerebral erosion or leptomeningeal cyst due to the usual development of a cystic mass filled with cerebrospinal fluid is a rare complication of head injury usually associated with linear skull fractures of the parietal bone in children under 3. It has been reported in older children in atypical regions of the skull such as the basioccipital and the base of the skull base and in association with other types of skull fractures. It is characterized by a diastatic enlargement of the fracture. Various factors are associated with the development of a GSF. The primary causative factor is a tear in the dura mater. The skull fracture enlarges due, in part, to the rapid physiologic growth of the brain that occurs in young children, and brain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pulsations in the underlying leptomeningeal cystic mass. Cranial burst fracture A cranial burst skull fracture, usually occurring with severe injuries in infants less than 1 year of age, is a closed, diastatic skull fracture with cerebral extrusion beyond the outer table of the skull under the intact scalp. Acute scalp swelling is associated with this type of fracture. In equivocal cases without immediate scalp swelling the diagnosis may be made via the use of magnetic resonance imaging thus insuring more prompt treatment and avoiding the development of a \\"growing skull fracture\\". =Compound fracture= Compound skull fractures occur when all layers protecting the brain have been breached from the epidermis to the meninges allowing outside environmental contact with the skull cavity A fracture in conjunction with an overlying laceration that tears the epidermis and the meninges—or runs through the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear structures, putting the outside environment in contact with the cranial cavity—is a compound fracture. Compound fractures may either be clean or contaminated. Intracranial air (pneumocephalus) may occur in compound skull fractures.Fundamentals of diagnostic radiology by William E. Brant, Clyde A. Helms p.56 The most serious complication of compound skull fractures is infection. Increased risk factors for infection include visible contamination, meningeal tear, loose bone fragments and presenting for treatment more than eight hours after initial injury. Compound elevated fracture A compound elevated skull fracture is a rare type of skull fracture where the fractured bone is elevated above the intact outer table of the skull. This type of skull fracture is always compound in nature. It can be caused during an assault with a weapon where the initial blow penetrates the skull and the underlying meninges and, on withdrawal, the weapon lifts the fractured portion of the skull outward. It can also be caused by the skull rotating while being struck in a case of blunt force trauma, the skull rotating while striking an inanimate object as in a fall, or it may occur during transfer of a patient after an initial compound head injury.Elevated skull fracture[www.ijntonline.com/Dec07/abstracts/abs12.PDF] Anatomy The human skull is anatomically divided into two parts: the neurocranium, formed by eight cranial bones that houses and protect the brain—and the facial skeleton (viscerocranium) composed of fourteen bones, not including the three ossicles of the inner ear.Anne M. Gilroy: : Atlas of Anatomy. P.454; Thime Medical Publishers Inc. (2008) The term skull fracture typically means fractures to the neurocranium, while fractures of the facial portion of the skull are facial fractures, or if the jaw is fractured, a mandibular fracture. The eight cranial bones are separated by sutures : one frontal bone, two parietal bones, two temporal bones, one occipital bone, one sphenoid bone, and one ethmoid bone.Leon Schlossberg, George D. Zuidema, Johns: The Johns Hopkins Atlas of Human Functional Anatomy, p.5; The Johns Hopkins University Press; (1997) The bones of the skull are in three layers: the hard compact layer of the external table (lamina externa), the diploë (a spongy layer of red bone marrow in the middle, and the compact layer of the inner table (Lamina interna).Johannes Lang: Skull base and related structures: atlas of clinical anatomy. P.208. F.K.Schattauer, Germany;(July 1999) Skull thickness is variable, depending on location. Thus the traumatic impact required to cause a fracture depends on the impact site. The skull is thick at the glabella, the external occipital protuberance, the mastoid processes, and the external angular process of the frontal bone. Areas of the skull that are covered with muscle have no underlying diploë formation between the internal and external lamina, which results in thin bone more susceptible to fractures. Skull fractures occur more easily at the thin squamous temporal and parietal bones, the sphenoid sinus, the foramen magnum (the opening at the base of the skull that the spinal cord passes through), the petrous temporal ridge, and the inner portions of the sphenoid wings at the base of the skull. The middle cranial fossa, a depression at the base of the cranial cavity forms the thinnest part of the skull and is thus the weakest part. This area of the cranial floor is weakened further by the presence of multiple foramina; as a result this section is at higher risk for basilar skull fractures to occur. Other areas more susceptible to fractures are the cribriform plate, the roof of orbits in the anterior cranial fossa, and the areas between the mastoid and dural sinuses in the posterior cranial fossa.Medscape: Ali Nawaz Khan: Imaging in Skull Fractures Prognosis Children with a simple skull fracture without other concerns are at low risk of a bad outcome and rarely require aggressive treatment. The presence of a concussion or skull fracture in people after trauma without intracranial hemorrhage or focal neurologic deficits was indicated in long term cognitive impairments and emotional lability at nearly double the rate as those patients without either complication. Those with a skull fracture were shown to have \\"neuropsychological dysfunction, even in the absence of intracranial pathology or more severe disturbance of consciousness on the GCS\\".

Although computationally efficient in principle, the method as initially formulated was not useful, due to its numerical instability. In 1970, Ojalvo and Newman showed how to make the method numerically stable and applied it to the solution of very large engineering structures subjected to dynamic loading. This was achieved using a method for purifying the Lanczos vectors (i.e. by repeatedly reorthogonalizing each newly generated vector with all previously generated ones) to any degree of accuracy, which when not performed, produced a series of vectors that were highly contaminated by those associated with the lowest natural frequencies. In their original work, these authors also suggested how to select a starting vector (i.e. use a random- number generator to select each element of the starting vector) and suggested an empirically determined method for determining m , the reduced number of vectors (i.e. it should be selected to be approximately 1.5 times the number of accurate eigenvalues desired). Soon thereafter their work was followed by Paige, who also provided an error analysis. In 1988, Ojalvo produced a more detailed history of this algorithm and an efficient eigenvalue error test. The algorithm :Input a Hermitian matrix A of size n \\\\times n, and optionally a number of iterations m (as default, let m=n). :* Strictly speaking, the algorithm does not need access to the explicit matrix, but only a function v \\\\mapsto A v that computes the product of the matrix by an arbitrary vector. This function is called at most m times. :Output an n \\\\times m matrix V with orthonormal columns and a tridiagonal real symmetric matrix T = V^* A V of size m \\\\times m. If m=n, then V is unitary, and A = V T V^* . :Warning The Lanczos iteration is prone to numerical instability. When executed in non-exact arithmetic, additional measures (as outlined in later sections) should be taken to ensure validity of the results. :# Let v_1 \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^n be an arbitrary vector with Euclidean norm 1. :# Abbreviated initial iteration step: :## Let w_1' = A v_1 . :## Let \\\\alpha_1 = w_1'^* v_1 . :## Let w_1 = w_1' - \\\\alpha_1 v_1 . :# For j=2,\\\\dots,m do: :## Let \\\\beta_j = \\\\ w_{j-1} \\\\ (also Euclidean norm). :## If \\\\beta_j eq 0 , then let v_j = w_{j-1} / \\\\beta_j , :##: else pick as v_j an arbitrary vector with Euclidean norm 1 that is orthogonal to all of v_1,\\\\dots,v_{j-1} . :## Let w_j' = A v_j . :## Let \\\\alpha_j = w_j'^* v_j . :## Let w_j = w_j' - \\\\alpha_j v_j - \\\\beta_j v_{j-1} . :# Let V be the matrix with columns v_1,\\\\dots,v_m .

There are in principle four ways to write the iteration procedure. Paige and other works show that the above order of operations is the most numerically stable. In practice the initial vector v_1 may be taken as another argument of the procedure, with \\\\beta_j=0 and indicators of numerical imprecision being included as additional loop termination conditions. Not counting the matrix–vector multiplication, each iteration does O(n) arithmetical operations. The matrix–vector multiplication can be done in O(dn) arithmetical operations where d is the average number of nonzero elements in a row. The total complexity is thus O(dmn), or O(dn^2) if m=n; the Lanczos algorithm can be very fast for sparse matrices. Schemes for improving numerical stability are typically judged against this high performance. The vectors v_j are called Lanczos vectors. The vector w_j' is not used after w_j is computed, and the vector w_j is not used after v_{j+1} is computed. Hence one may use the same storage for all three. Likewise, if only the tridiagonal matrix T is sought, then the raw iteration does not need v_{j-1} after having computed w_j , although some schemes for improving the numerical stability would need it later on. Sometimes the subsequent Lanczos vectors are recomputed from v_1 when needed. = Application to the eigenproblem = The Lanczos algorithm is most often brought up in the context of finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, but whereas an ordinary diagonalization of a matrix would make eigenvectors and eigenvalues apparent from inspection, the same is not true for the tridiagonalization performed by the Lanczos algorithm; nontrivial additional steps are needed to compute even a single eigenvalue or eigenvector. Nonetheless, applying the Lanczos algorithm is often a significant step forward in computing the eigendecomposition. If \\\\lambda is an eigenvalue of A, and if T x = \\\\lambda x (x is an eigenvector of T) then y = V x is the corresponding eigenvector of A (since A y = A V x = V T V^* V x = V T I x = V T x = V (\\\\lambda x) = \\\\lambda V x = \\\\lambda y). Thus the Lanczos algorithm transforms the eigendecomposition problem for A into the eigendecomposition problem for T. # For tridiagonal matrices, there exist a number of specialised algorithms, often with better computational complexity than general-purpose algorithms. For example, if T is an m \\\\times m tridiagonal symmetric matrix then: #* The continuant recursion allows computing the characteristic polynomial in O(m^2) operations, and evaluating it at a point in O(m) operations. #* The divide-and-conquer eigenvalue algorithm can be used to compute the entire eigendecomposition of T in O(m^2) operations. #* The Fast Multipole Method can compute all eigenvalues in just O(m \\\\log m) operations. # Some general eigendecomposition algorithms, notably the QR algorithm, are known to converge faster for tridiagonal matrices than for general matrices. Asymptotic complexity of tridiagonal QR is O(m^2) just as for the divide-and-conquer algorithm (though the constant factor may be different); since the eigenvectors together have m^2 elements, this is asymptotically optimal. # Even algorithms whose convergence rates are unaffected by unitary transformations, such as the power method and inverse iteration, may enjoy low-level performance benefits from being applied to the tridiagonal matrix T rather than the original matrix A. Since T is very sparse with all nonzero elements in highly predictable positions, it permits compact storage with excellent performance vis-à-vis caching. Likewise, T is a real matrix with all eigenvectors and eigenvalues real, whereas A in general may have complex elements and eigenvectors, so real arithmetic is sufficient for finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of T. # If n is very large, then reducing m so that T is of a manageable size will still allow finding the more extreme eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A; in the m \\\\ll n region, the Lanczos algorithm can be viewed as a lossy compression scheme for Hermitian matrices, that emphasises preserving the extreme eigenvalues. The combination of good performance for sparse matrices and the ability to compute several (without computing all) eigenvalues are the main reasons for choosing to use the Lanczos algorithm. = Application to tridiagonalization = Though the eigenproblem is often the motivation for applying the Lanczos algorithm, the operation the algorithm primarily performs is tridiagonalization of a matrix, for which numerically stable Householder transformations have been favoured since the 1950s. During the 1960s the Lanczos algorithm was disregarded. Interest in it was rejuvenated by the Kaniel–Paige convergence theory and the development of methods to prevent numerical instability, but the Lanczos algorithm remains the alternative algorithm that one tries only if Householder is not satisfactory. Aspects in which the two algorithms differ include: * Lanczos takes advantage of A being a sparse matrix, whereas Householder does not, and will generate fill-in. * Lanczos works throughout with the original matrix A (and has no problem with it being known only implicitly), whereas raw Householder wants to modify the matrix during the computation (although that can be avoided). * Each iteration of the Lanczos algorithm produces another column of the final transformation matrix V, whereas an iteration of Householder produces another factor in a unitary factorisation Q_1 Q_2 \\\\dots Q_n of V. Each factor is however determined by a single vector, so the storage requirements are the same for both algorithms, and V = Q_1 Q_2 \\\\dots Q_n can be computed in O(n^3) time. * Householder is numerically stable, whereas raw Lanczos is not. * Lanczos is highly parallel, with only O(n) points of synchronisation (the computations of \\\\alpha_j and \\\\beta_j). Householder is less parallel, having a sequence of O(n^2) scalar quantities computed that each depend on the previous quantity in the sequence. Derivation of the algorithm There are several lines of reasoning which lead to the Lanczos algorithm. =A more provident power method= The power method for finding the eigenvalue of largest magnitude and a corresponding eigenvector of a matrix A is roughly :# Pick a random vector u_1 eq 0. :# For j \\\\geqslant 1 (until the direction of u_j has converged) do: :## Let u_{j+1}' = A u_j. :## Let u_{j+1} = u_{j+1}' / \\\\ u_{j+1}' \\\\. :* In the large j limit, u_j approaches the normed eigenvector corresponding to the largest magnitude eigenvalue. A critique that can be raised against this method is that it is wasteful: it spends a lot of work (the matrix–vector products in step 2.1) extracting information from the matrix A, but pays attention only to the very last result; implementations typically use the same variable for all the vectors u_j, having each new iteration overwrite the results from the previous one. What if we instead kept all the intermediate results and organised their data? One piece of information that trivially is available from the vectors u_j is a chain of Krylov subspaces. One way of stating that without introducing sets into the algorithm is to claim that it computes :a subset \\\\\\\\{v_j\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^m of a basis of \\\\Complex^n such that Ax \\\\in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_{j+1}) for every x \\\\in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j) and all 1 \\\\leqslant j < m; this is trivially satisfied by v_j = u_j as long as u_j is linearly independent of u_1,\\\\dotsc,u_{j-1} (and in the case that there is such a dependence then one may continue the sequence by picking as v_j an arbitrary vector linearly independent of u_1,\\\\dotsc,u_{j-1}). A basis containing the u_j vectors is however likely to be numerically ill-conditioned, since this sequence of vectors is by design meant to converge to an eigenvector of A. To avoid that, one can combine the power iteration with a Gram–Schmidt process, to instead produce an orthonormal basis of these Krylov subspaces. :# Pick a random vector u_1 of Euclidean norm 1. Let v_1 = u_1. :# For j = 1,\\\\dotsc,m-1 do: :## Let u_{j+1}' = A u_j . :## For all k = 1, \\\\dotsc, j let g_{k,j} = v_k^* u_{j+1}'. (These are the coordinates of A u_j = u_{j+1}' with respect to the basis vectors v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j.) :## Let w_{j+1} = u_{j+1}' - \\\\sum_{k=1}^j g_{k,j} v_k. (Cancel the component of u_{j+1}' that is in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j).) :## If w_{j+1} eq 0 then let u_{j+1} = u_{j+1}' / \\\\ u_{j+1}' \\\\ and v_{j+1} = w_{j+1} / \\\\ w_{j+1} \\\\ , :##: otherwise pick as u_{j+1} = v_{j+1} an arbitrary vector of Euclidean norm 1 that is orthogonal to all of v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j. The relation between the power iteration vectors u_j and the orthogonal vectors v_j is that : A u_j = \\\\ u_{j+1}'\\\\ u_{j+1} = u_{j+1}' = w_{j+1} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^j g_{k,j} v_k = \\\\ w_{j+1}\\\\ v_{j+1} + \\\\sum_{k=1}^j g_{k,j} v_k . Here it may be observed that we do not actually need the u_j vectors to compute these v_j, because u_j - v_j \\\\in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_{j-1}) and therefore the difference between u_{j+1}' = A u_j and w_{j+1}' = A v_j is in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j), which is cancelled out by the orthogonalisation process. Thus the same basis for the chain of Krylov subspaces is computed by :# Pick a random vector v_1 of Euclidean norm 1. :# For j = 1,\\\\dotsc,m-1 do: :## Let w_{j+1}' = A v_j . :## For all k = 1, \\\\dotsc, j let h_{k,j} = v_k^* w_{j+1}'. :## Let w_{j+1} = w_{j+1}' - \\\\sum_{k=1}^j h_{k,j} v_k . :## Let h_{j+1,j} = \\\\ w_{j+1} \\\\ . :## If h_{j+1,j} eq 0 then let v_{j+1} = w_{j+1} / h_{j+1,j} , :##: otherwise pick as v_{j+1} an arbitrary vector of Euclidean norm 1 that is orthogonal to all of v_1,\\\\dotsc,v_j. A priori the coefficients h_{k,j} satisfy : A v_j = \\\\sum_{k=1}^{j+1} h_{k,j} v_k for all j < m ; the definition h_{j+1,j} = \\\\ w_{j+1} \\\\ may seem a bit odd, but fits the general pattern h_{k,j} = v_k^* w_{j+1}' since : v_{j+1}^* w_{j+1}' = v_{j+1}^* w_{j+1} = \\\\ w_{j+1} \\\\ v_{j+1}^* v_{j+1} = \\\\ w_{j+1} \\\\. Because the power iteration vectors u_j that were eliminated from this recursion satisfy u_j \\\\in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_j), the vectors \\\\\\\\{v_j\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^m and coefficients h_{k,j} contain enough information from A that all of u_1,\\\\ldots,u_m can be computed, so nothing was lost by switching vectors. (Indeed, it turns out that the data collected here give significantly better approximations of the largest eigenvalue than one gets from an equal number of iterations in the power method, although that is not necessarily obvious at this point.) This last procedure is the Arnoldi iteration. The Lanczos algorithm then arises as the simplification one gets from eliminating calculation steps that turn out to be trivial when A is Hermitian—in particular most of the h_{k,j} coefficients turn out to be zero. Elementarily, if A is Hermitian then : h_{k,j} = v_k^* w_{j+1}' = v_k^* A v_j = v_k^* A^* v_j = (A v_k)^* v_j. For k < j-1 we know that A v_k \\\\in \\\\operatorname{span}(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_{j-1}) , and since v_j by construction is orthogonal to this subspace, this inner product must be zero. (This is essentially also the reason why sequences of orthogonal polynomials can always be given a three-term recurrence relation.) For k = j-1 one gets : h_{j-1,j} = (A v_{j-1})^* v_j = \\\\overline{v_j^* A v_{j-1} } = \\\\overline{ h_{j,j-1} } = h_{j,j-1} since the latter is real on account of being the norm of a vector. For k = j one gets : h_{j,j} = (A v_j)^* v_j = \\\\overline{v_j^* A v_j } = \\\\overline{h_{j,j}}, meaning this is real too. More abstractly, if V is the matrix with columns v_1,\\\\ldots,v_m then the numbers h_{k,j} can be identified as elements of the matrix H = V^*AV, and h_{k,j} = 0 for k > j+1; the matrix H is upper Hessenberg. Since : H^* = \\\\left (V^* A V \\\\right )^* = V^* A^* V = V^* A V = H the matrix H is Hermitian. This implies that H is also lower Hessenberg, so it must in fact be tridiagional. Being Hermitian, its main diagonal is real, and since its first subdiagonal is real by construction, the same is true for its first superdiagonal. Therefore, H is a real, symmetric matrix—the matrix T of the Lanczos algorithm specification. =Simultaneous approximation of extreme eigenvalues= One way of characterising the eigenvectors of a Hermitian matrix A is as stationary points of the Rayleigh quotient : r(x) = \\\\frac{x^* A x} {x^* x}, \\\\qquad x \\\\in\\\\Complex^n. In particular, the largest eigenvalue \\\\lambda_\\\\max is the global maximum of r and the smallest eigenvalue \\\\lambda_\\\\min is the global minimum of r. Within a low- dimensional subspace \\\\mathcal{L} of \\\\Complex^n it can be feasible to locate the maximum x and minimum y of r. Repeating that for an increasing chain \\\\mathcal{L}_1 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{L}_2 \\\\subset \\\\cdots produces two sequences of vectors: x_1, x_2, \\\\ldots and y_1, y_2, \\\\dotsc such that x_j, y_j \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_j and :\\\\begin{align} r(x_1) &\\\\leqslant r(x_2) \\\\leqslant \\\\cdots \\\\leqslant \\\\lambda_\\\\max  r(y_1) &\\\\geqslant r(y_2) \\\\geqslant \\\\cdots \\\\geqslant \\\\lambda_\\\\min \\\\end{align} The question then arises how to choose the subspaces so that these sequences converge at optimal rate. From x_j, the optimal direction in which to seek larger values of r is that of the gradient abla r(x_j), and likewise from y_j the optimal direction in which to seek smaller values of r is that of the negative gradient - abla r(y_j). In general : abla r(x) = \\\\frac{2}{x^* x} ( A x - r(x) x ) , so the directions of interest are easy enough to compute in matrix arithmetic, but if one wishes to improve on both x_j and y_j then there are two new directions to take into account: Ax_j and Ay_j; since x_j and y_j can be linearly independent vectors (indeed, are close to orthogonal), one cannot in general expect Ax_j and Ay_j to be parallel. Is it therefore necessary to increase the dimension of \\\\mathcal{L}_j by 2 on every step? Not if \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{L}_j\\\\\\\\}_{j=1}^m are taken to be Krylov subspaces, because then Az \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_{j+1} for all z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_j, thus in particular for both z = x_j and z = y_j. In other words, we can start with some arbitrary initial vector x_1 = y_1, construct the vector spaces : \\\\mathcal{L}_j = \\\\operatorname{span}( x_1, A x_1, \\\\ldots, A^{j-1} x_1 ) and then seek x_j, y_j \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_j such that : r(x_j) = \\\\max_{z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_j} r(z) \\\\qquad \\\\text{and} \\\\qquad r(y_j) = \\\\min_{z \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}_j} r(z). Since the jth power method iterate u_j belongs to \\\\mathcal{L}_j, it follows that an iteration to produce the x_j and y_j cannot converge slower than that of the power method, and will achieve more by approximating both eigenvalue extremes. For the subproblem of optimising r on some \\\\mathcal{L}_j , it is convenient to have an orthonormal basis \\\\\\\\{ v_1, \\\\ldots, v_j \\\\\\\\} for this vector space. Thus we are again led to the problem of iteratively computing such a basis for the sequence of Krylov subspaces. Convergence and other dynamics When analysing the dynamics of the algorithm, it is convenient to take the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A as given, even though they are not explicitly known to the user. To fix notation, let \\\\lambda_1 \\\\geqslant \\\\lambda_2 \\\\geqslant \\\\dotsb \\\\geqslant \\\\lambda_n be the eigenvalues (these are known to all be real, and thus possible to order) and let z_1,\\\\dotsc,z_n be an orthonormal set of eigenvectors such that A z_k = \\\\lambda_k z_k for all k=1,\\\\dotsc,n. It is also convenient to fix a notation for the coefficients of the initial Lanczos vector v_1 with respect to this eigenbasis; let d_k = z_k^* v_1 for all k=1,\\\\dotsc,n, so that \\\\textstyle v_1 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k z_k. A starting vector v_1 depleted of some eigenvalue will delay convergence to the corresponding eigenvalue, and even though this just comes out as a constant factor in the error bounds, depletion remains undesirable. One common technique for avoiding being consistently hit by it is to pick v_1 by first drawing the elements randomly according to the same normal distribution with mean 0 and then rescale the vector to norm 1. Prior to the rescaling, this causes the coefficients d_k to also be independent normally distributed stochastic variables from the same normal distribution (since the change of coordinates is unitary), and after rescaling the vector (d_1,\\\\dotsc,d_n) will have a uniform distribution on the unit sphere in \\\\mathbb{C}^n. This makes it possible to bound the probability that for example d_1 < \\\\varepsilon. The fact that the Lanczos algorithm is coordinate- agnostic – operations only look at inner products of vectors, never at individual elements of vectors – makes it easy to construct examples with known eigenstructure to run the algorithm on: make A a diagonal matrix with the desired eigenvalues on the diagonal; as long as the starting vector v_1 has enough nonzero elements, the algorithm will output a general tridiagonal symmetric matrix as T. =Kaniel–Paige convergence theory= After m iteration steps of the Lanczos algorithm, T is an m \\\\times m real symmetric matrix, that similarly to the above has m eigenvalues \\\\theta_1 \\\\geqslant \\\\theta_2 \\\\geqslant \\\\dots \\\\geqslant \\\\theta_m. By convergence is primarily understood the convergence of \\\\theta_1 to \\\\lambda_1 (and the symmetrical convergence of \\\\theta_m to \\\\lambda_n) as m grows, and secondarily the convergence of some range \\\\theta_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\theta_k of eigenvalues of T to their counterparts \\\\lambda_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\lambda_k of A. The convergence for the Lanczos algorithm is often orders of magnitude faster than that for the power iteration algorithm. The bounds for \\\\theta_1 come from the above interpretation of eigenvalues as extreme values of the Rayleigh quotient r(x). Since \\\\lambda_1 is a priori the maximum of r on the whole of \\\\Complex^n, whereas \\\\theta_1 is merely the maximum on an m-dimensional Krylov subspace, we trivially get \\\\lambda_1 \\\\geqslant \\\\theta_1. Conversely, any point x in that Krylov subspace provides a lower bound r(x) for \\\\theta_1, so if a point can be exhibited for which \\\\lambda_1 - r(x) is small then this provides a tight bound on \\\\theta_1. The dimension m Krylov subspace is :\\\\operatorname{span} \\\\left \\\\\\\\{v_1, A v_1, A^2 v_1, \\\\ldots, A^{m-1} v_1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, so any element of it can be expressed as p(A) v_1 for some polynomial p of degree at most m-1; the coefficients of that polynomial are simply the coefficients in the linear combination of the vectors v_1, A v_1, A^2 v_1, \\\\ldots, A^{m-1} v_1 . The polynomial we want will turn out to have real coefficients, but for the moment we should allow also for complex coefficients, and we will write p^* for the polynomial obtained by complex conjugating all coefficients of p. In this parametrisation of the Krylov subspace, we have :r(p(A)v_1) = \\\\frac{(p(A) v_1)^* A p(A) v_1}{(p(A) v_1)^* p(A) v_1} = \\\\frac{v_1^* p(A)^* A p(A) v_1}{v_1^* p(A)^* p(A) v_1} = \\\\frac{v_1^* p^*(A^*) A p(A) v_1 }{v_1^* p^*(A^*) p(A) v_1} = \\\\frac{ v_1^* p^*(A) A p(A) v_1 }{v_1^* p^*(A) p(A) v_1} Using now the expression for v_1 as a linear combination of eigenvectors, we get : A v_1 = A \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k z_k = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k \\\\lambda_k z_k and more generally :q(A) v_1 = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k q(\\\\lambda_k) z_k for any polynomial q. Thus :\\\\lambda_1 - r(p(A)v_1) = \\\\lambda_1 - \\\\frac{v_1^* \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k p^*(\\\\lambda_k) \\\\lambda_k p(\\\\lambda_k) z_k}{v_1^* \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k p^*(\\\\lambda_k) p(\\\\lambda_k) z_k} = \\\\lambda_1 - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k^2 \\\\lambda_k p(\\\\lambda_k)^* p(\\\\lambda_k)}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k^2 p(\\\\lambda_k)^* p(\\\\lambda_k)} = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k^2 (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_k) \\\\left p(\\\\lambda_k) \\\\right^2 }{\\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k^2 \\\\left p(\\\\lambda_k) \\\\right^2 }. A key difference between numerator and denominator here is that the k=1 term vanishes in the numerator, but not in the denominator. Thus if one can pick p to be large at \\\\lambda_1 but small at all other eigenvalues, one will get a tight bound on the error \\\\lambda_1-\\\\theta_1. Since A has many more eigenvalues than p has coefficients, this may seem a tall order, but one way to meet it is to use Chebyshev polynomials. Writing c_k for the degree k Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind (that which satisfies c_k(\\\\cos x) = \\\\cos(kx) for all x), we have a polynomial which stays in the range [-1,1] on the known interval [-1,1] but grows rapidly outside it. With some scaling of the argument, we can have it map all eigenvalues except \\\\lambda_1 into [-1,1]. Let : p(x) = c_{m-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{2x - \\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n}{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n} \\\\right) (in case \\\\lambda_2=\\\\lambda_1, use instead the largest eigenvalue strictly less than \\\\lambda_1), then the maximal value of  p(\\\\lambda_k)^2 for k \\\\geqslant 2 is 1 and the minimal value is 0, so :\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\theta_1 \\\\leqslant \\\\lambda_1 - r(p(A) v_1) = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=2}^n d_k^2 (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_k) p(\\\\lambda_k)^2 }{ \\\\sum_{k=1}^n d_k^2 p(\\\\lambda_k)^2} \\\\leqslant \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{k=2}^n d_k^2 (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_k)}{d_1^2 p(\\\\lambda_1)^2 } \\\\leqslant \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_n) \\\\sum_{k=2}^n d_k^2 }{p(\\\\lambda_1)^2 d_1^2 }. Furthermore : p(\\\\lambda_1) = c_{m-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n}{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n} \\\\right) = c_{m-1}\\\\left( 2\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n} + 1 \\\\right); the quantity : \\\\rho = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1 - \\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_2 - \\\\lambda_n} (i.e., the ratio of the first eigengap to the diameter of the rest of the spectrum) is thus of key importance for the convergence rate here. Also writing : R = e^{\\\\operatorname{arcosh}(1+2\\\\rho)} = 1 + 2\\\\rho + 2\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho^2+\\\\rho}, we may conclude that : \\\\begin{align} \\\\lambda_1 - \\\\theta_1 &\\\\leqslant \\\\frac{(\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_n) \\\\left(1 - d_1^2 \\\\right )}{c_{m-1}(2\\\\rho+1)^2 d_1^2} \\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1 - d_1^2}{d_1^2} (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_n) \\\\frac{1}{\\\\cosh^2 ((m-1) \\\\operatorname{arcosh}(1+2\\\\rho))} \\\\[6pt] &= \\\\frac{1 - d_1^2}{d_1^2} (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_n) \\\\frac{4}{\\\\left (R^{m-1} + R^{-(m-1)} \\\\right )^2} \\\\[6pt] &\\\\leqslant 4 \\\\frac{1 - d_1^2}{d_1^2} (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_n) R^{-2(m-1)} \\\\end{align} The convergence rate is thus controlled chiefly by R, since this bound shrinks by a factor R^{-2} for each extra iteration. For comparison, one may consider how the convergence rate of the power method depends on \\\\rho, but since the power method primarily is sensitive to the quotient between absolute values of the eigenvalues, we need \\\\lambda_n \\\\leqslant \\\\lambda_2 for the eigengap between \\\\lambda_1 and \\\\lambda_2 to be the dominant one. Under that constraint, the case that most favours the power method is that \\\\lambda_n = -\\\\lambda_2, so consider that. Late in the power method, the iteration vector: : u = (1-t^2)^{1/2} z_1 + t z_2 \\\\approx z_1 + t z_2, where each new iteration effectively multiplies the z_2-amplitude t by :\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_1} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_2 + (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2)} = \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2}{\\\\lambda_2}} = \\\\frac{1}{1 + 2\\\\rho}. The estimate of the largest eigenvalue is then : u^*Au = (1-t^2)\\\\lambda_1 + t^2\\\\lambda_2, so the above bound for the Lanczos algorithm convergence rate should be compared to :\\\\lambda_1 - u^*Au = (\\\\lambda_1-\\\\lambda_2) t^2, which shrinks by a factor of (1+2\\\\rho)^{-2} for each iteration. The difference thus boils down to that between 1+2\\\\rho and R = 1 + 2\\\\rho + 2\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho^2+\\\\rho}. In the \\\\rho \\\\gg 1 region, the latter is more like 1+4\\\\rho , and performs like the power method would with an eigengap twice as large; a notable improvement. The more challenging case is however that of \\\\rho \\\\ll 1, in which R \\\\approx 1 + 2\\\\sqrt{\\\\rho} is an even larger improvement on the eigengap; the \\\\rho \\\\gg 1 region is where the Lanczos algorithm convergence-wise makes the smallest improvement on the power method. Numerical stability Stability means how much the algorithm will be affected (i.e. will it produce the approximate result close to the original one) if there are small numerical errors introduced and accumulated. Numerical stability is the central criterion for judging the usefulness of implementing an algorithm on a computer with roundoff. For the Lanczos algorithm, it can be proved that with exact arithmetic, the set of vectors v_1, v_2, \\\\cdots, v_{m+1} constructs an orthonormal basis, and the eigenvalues/vectors solved are good approximations to those of the original matrix. However, in practice (as the calculations are performed in floating point arithmetic where inaccuracy is inevitable), the orthogonality is quickly lost and in some cases the new vector could even be linearly dependent on the set that is already constructed. As a result, some of the eigenvalues of the resultant tridiagonal matrix may not be approximations to the original matrix. Therefore, the Lanczos algorithm is not very stable. Users of this algorithm must be able to find and remove those \\"spurious\\" eigenvalues. Practical implementations of the Lanczos algorithm go in three directions to fight this stability issue: # Prevent the loss of orthogonality, # Recover the orthogonality after the basis is generated. # After the good and \\"spurious\\" eigenvalues are all identified, remove the spurious ones. Variations Variations on the Lanczos algorithm exist where the vectors involved are tall, narrow matrices instead of vectors and the normalizing constants are small square matrices. These are called \\"block\\" Lanczos algorithms and can be much faster on computers with large numbers of registers and long memory-fetch times. Many implementations of the Lanczos algorithm restart after a certain number of iterations. One of the most influential restarted variations is the implicitly restarted Lanczos method, which is implemented in ARPACK. This has led into a number of other restarted variations such as restarted Lanczos bidiagonalization. Another successful restarted variation is the Thick-Restart Lanczos method, which has been implemented in a software package called TRLan. =Nullspace over a finite field= In 1995, Peter Montgomery published an algorithm, based on the Lanczos algorithm, for finding elements of the nullspace of a large sparse matrix over GF(2); since the set of people interested in large sparse matrices over finite fields and the set of people interested in large eigenvalue problems scarcely overlap, this is often also called the block Lanczos algorithm without causing unreasonable confusion. Applications Lanczos algorithms are very attractive because the multiplication by A\\\\, is the only large-scale linear operation. Since weighted-term text retrieval engines implement just this operation, the Lanczos algorithm can be applied efficiently to text documents (see Latent Semantic Indexing). Eigenvectors are also important for large-scale ranking methods such as the HITS algorithm developed by Jon Kleinberg, or the PageRank algorithm used by Google. Lanczos algorithms are also used in Condensed Matter Physics as a method for solving Hamiltonians of strongly correlated electron systems, as well as in shell model codes in nuclear physics. Implementations The NAG Library contains several routines for the solution of large scale linear systems and eigenproblems which use the Lanczos algorithm. MATLAB and GNU Octave come with ARPACK built-in. Both stored and implicit matrices can be analyzed through the eigs() function (Matlab/Octave). A Matlab implementation of the Lanczos algorithm (note precision issues) is available as a part of the Gaussian Belief Propagation Matlab Package. The GraphLabGraphLab collaborative filtering library incorporates a large scale parallel implementation of the Lanczos algorithm (in C++) for multicore. The PRIMME library also implements a Lanczos like algorithm.

Life and career Pechstein was born in Zwickau, the son of a craftsman who worked in a textile mill. Early contact with the art of Vincent van Gogh stimulated Pechstein's development toward expressionism. He first worked as a decorator in his hometown before enrolling at the School of Applied Arts and then at the Royal Art Academy in Dresden, where he met the painter Otto Gussman and the architect Wilhelm Kreis. It was here starting in 1902 he became a pupil of Gussmann; a relationship that would last until 1906 when Pechstein met Erich Heckel and was invited to join the art group Die Brücke. He was the only member to have received formal art training and was an active member until 1910 where he often worked alongside Brücke painters creating a similar, homogenous style of this period. During this time in 1907, Pechstein traveled to Italy to receive an award and upon his return in 1908 spent time in Paris where he met Fauvist painter Kees van Dongen who he convinced to join Die Brücke. Later that year Pechstein moved to Berlin (a move that fellow painters would make in the following three years). After being categorically rejected from exhibiting in the Berlin Secession in 1910, he helped to found and become chairman of the New Secession and gained recognition for his decorative and colorful paintings that were lent from the ideas of Van Gogh, Matisse, and the Fauves. In 1912, after years of rising tensions, Pechstein was expelled from the group after exhibiting some of his work in the aforementioned Berlin Secession. This expulsion was a relatively happy one as Pechstein had been receiving rewards and recognition far beyond his peers due to his conservative style that appeased a wider audience. This recognition only distanced himself from the group and bred animosity among the members. His paintings eventually became more primitivist, incorporating thick black lines and angular figures, and, looking for inspiration, he traveled to Palau. Upon the breakout of World War I, Pechstein became interned in Japan and was then sent to Germany to fight on the Western Front (World War I) in 1916. Despite his notably conservative stance and style, after the German Revolution of 1918–19, Pechstein joined two radical, socialist groups: the Arbeitsrat für Kunst and the November Group (German). Beginning in 1922, Pechstein became a professor at the Berlin Academy. Beginning in 1933, Pechstein was vilified by the Nazis because of his art. He was banned from painting or exhibiting his art and later that year was fired from his teaching position. A total of 326 of his paintings were removed from German museums. Sixteen of his works were displayed in the Entartete Kunst (Degenerate Art) exhibition of 1937. During this time, Pechstein went into seclusion in rural Pomerania. He was reinstated in 1945, and subsequently won numerous titles and awards for his work. He was a prolific printmaker, producing 421 lithographs, 315 woodcuts and linocuts, and 165 intaglio prints, mostly etchings. He died in West Berlin. He is buried on the Evangelischer Friedhof Alt-Schmargendorf in Berlin.

Symptoms may include bruising behind the ears, bruising around the eyes, or blood behind the ear drum. A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak occurs in about 20% of cases and can result in fluid leaking from the nose or ear. Meningitis is a complication in about 14% of cases. Other complications include cranial nerve or blood vessel injury. They typically require a significant degree of trauma to occur. The break is of at least one of the following bones: temporal bone, occipital bone, sphenoid bone, frontal bone, or ethmoid bone. They are divided into anterior fossa, middle fossa, and posterior fossa fractures. Facial fractures often also occur. Diagnosis is typically by CT scan. Treatment is generally based on the injury to structures inside the head. Surgery may be done for a CSF leak that does not stop or an injury to a blood vessel or nerve. Preventive antibiotics are of unclear use. It occurs in about 12% of people with a severe head injury. Signs and symptoms Bilateral raccoon eyes * Battle's sign – bruising of the mastoid process of the temporal bone. * Raccoon eyes – bruising around the eyes, i.e. \\"black eyes\\" * Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea * Cranial nerve palsy * Bleeding (sometimes profuse) from the nose and ears * Hemotympanum * Conductive or perceptive deafness, nystagmus, vomitus * In 1–10% of patients, optic nerve entrapment occurs. The optic nerve is compressed by the broken skull bones, causing irregularities in vision. * Serious cases usually result in death Pathophysiology A basilar skull fracture as seen on CT Diagram showing bones that may be involved in a basilar skull fracture Basilar skull fractures include breaks in the posterior skull base or anterior skull base. The former involve the occipital bone, temporal bone, and portions of the sphenoid bone; the latter, superior portions of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones. The temporal bone fracture is encountered in 75% of all basilar skull fractures and may be longitudinal, transverse or mixed, depending on the course of the fracture line in relation to the longitudinal axis of the pyramid. Bones may be broken around the foramen magnum, the hole in the base of the skull through which the brain stem exits and becomes the spinal cord, creating the risk that blood vessels and nerves exiting the hole may be damaged. Due to the proximity of the cranial nerves, injury to those nerves may occur. This can cause loss of function of the facial nerve or oculomotor nerve or hearing loss due to damage of cranial nerve VIII. Management Evidence does not support the use of preventive antibiotics regardless of the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Prognosis Non-displaced fractures usually heal without intervention. Patients with basilar skull fractures are especially likely to get meningitis. Unfortunately, the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotics in these cases is uncertain. =Temporal bone fractures= Acute injury to the internal carotid artery (carotid dissection, occlusion, pseudoaneurysm formation) may be asymptomatic or result in life-threatening bleeding. They are almost exclusively observed when the carotid canal is fractured, although only a minority of carotid canal fractures result in vascular injury. Involvement of the petrous segment of the carotid canal is associated with a relatively high incidence of carotid injury. Society and culture Basilar skull fractures are a common cause of death in many motor racing accidents. Drivers who have died as a result of basilar skull fractures include Formula One driver Roland Ratzenberger]; IndyCar drivers Bill Vukovich Sr., Tony Bettenhausen Sr., Floyd Roberts, and Scott Brayton; NASCAR drivers Dale Earnhardt Sr., Adam Petty, Tony Roper, Kenny Irwin Jr., Neil Bonnett, John Nemechek, J.D. McDuffie, and Richie Evans; CART drivers Jovy Marcelo, Greg Moore, and Gonzalo Rodriguez; and ARCA drivers Blaise Alexander and Slick Johnson. Ernie Irvan happens to be a survivor of basilar skull fracture after suffering an accident during practice in 1994 at the Michigan International Speedway.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckT7z-XwKUo Dale Jr. Download: Ernie Irvan's Horrific Crash To prevent this injury, many motorsports sanctioning bodies mandate the use of head and neck restraints, such as the HANS device. The HANS device has demonstrated its life-saving abilities multiple times, including Jeff Gordon at the 2006 Pocono 500, Michael McDowell at the Texas Motor Speedway in 2008, Robert Kubica at the 2007 Canadian Grand Prix, and Elliott Sadler at the 2010 Sunoco Red Cross Pennsylvania 500.

He arrived in America in 1694, accompanied by his wife Sarah. Rhett quickly became a prominent rice farmer and member of the South Carolina Assembly. Rhett was colonel of the Provincial militia, receiver-general of the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, surveyor, and comptroller of customs for Carolina and the Bahama Islands. He was also an active merchant captain, sailing the vessel Providence between the Carolinas and the Bahamas. In April 1699 the Providence was attacked by Dutch pirate Hendrick van Hoven (alias Captain Hyne or Hind): :\\"...about the latter end of April last, one Capt. Hind, a notorious pirate and sea-rover, having lately got into a brigantine with a mixt company of Dutch, French and other people, came up with an English-built ship mounted with two and twenty guns called the Providence galley, under the command of Capt. William Rhett of Carolina, who made a very generous defence, but was outdone and taken by the said Pirate.\\" In 1706, Rhett commanded a flotilla which fought off a Franco-Spanish attack on Charles Town. In 1718 he provided two vessels to be fitted out as pirate hunters - the Henry and the Sea Nymph, each with eight guns and a crew of between 60 and 70 men. Rhett assumed the position of captain of this small flotilla and led it to victory in the 1718 Battle of Cape Fear River, capturing the infamous Stede Bonnet, the so-called \\"gentleman pirate.\\" Bonnet escaped from jail with the help of local merchant and fellow pirate Richard Tookerman; he made it as far as Sullivan's Island before Rhett again captured him. Rhett's house in Charleston, completed in 1716, still stands in its original location at 54 Hasell St., Charleston, South Carolina. It has been restored and is now privately owned.

There are also distinct non-combat personal bodyguards which serve as ceremonial guards and personal attendants (such as the Gentlemen at Arms, the Yeomen of the Guard, the Royal Company of Archers, and the Company of Pikemen and Musketeers of the Honourable Artillery Company, as well as the Corps of Serjeants at Arms, the Gold Stick and Silver Stick, and the High Constables and Guard of Honour of the Palace of Holyroodhouse).

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, Colorado Rockies, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Philadelphia Phillies. Playing career =San Diego Padres= Nieves was selected by the Padres in the 47th round of the 1995 MLB draft. He made his major league debut on July 21, 2002, for the San Diego Padres, and played 28 games with them during their 2002 season. =Anaheim/Los Angeles Angels= Nieves was selected off waivers by the Anaheim Angels on December 20, 2002. =New York Yankees= He was traded to the New York Yankees for pitcher Bret Prinz. Nieves won a spot on the Yankees 2007 roster by beating out Todd Pratt and Raul Chavez during spring training. He served as the back-up catcher to Jorge Posada, but was primarily considered Mike Mussina's \\"personal catcher.\\" Joe Torre experimented with using Nieves to help bolster Mussina out of a rough stretch with good results. Nieves made his first career non-catching appearance in the ninth inning of a game on July 8, 2007, against the Angels; he played first base when the Yankees ran low on position players. Following an impressive 2-for-3 performance against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on July 21, 2007, Nieves was designated for assignment by the Yankees following news that they had acquired José Molina from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Though respected as a good defensive catcher, Nieves hit just .164 for the Yankees. \\"It's just business and I really want this team to go all the way to the playoffs and, hopefully, win the World Series,\\" Nieves said. \\"They're a bunch of great guys. I love them, Torre and all those guys. They can improve the backup catcher and they're bringing in Molina. He's a great catcher, too.\\" Nieves cleared waivers, and reported to the Yankees' Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees on July 27, 2007. Nieves was the starting catcher for Scranton. He declared free agency in October 2007. He played for Licey in the Dominican Winter League during the off- season. =Washington Nationals= He started the 2008 season in the Washington Nationals organization with the Triple-A Columbus Clippers of the International League. On April 25, 2008, Nieves hit his first major-league home run, a walk-off home run to right field, to give the Nationals a 5–3 win over the Chicago Cubs. Nieves was the backup catcher to starter Jesus Flores in the 2009 season. Nieves was the backup catcher for Iván Rodríguez in 2010. =Milwaukee Brewers= Milwaukee Brewers in 2011 spring training On December 10, 2010, Nieves signed a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers. =Atlanta Braves= He was traded to the Atlanta Braves on July 27, 2011, for $1. He was demoted to Triple-A Gwinnett shortly after, and J. C. Boscan was recalled to be the backup catcher. =Colorado Rockies= On December 18, 2011 Nieves signed a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies worth $414,000. After hitting .409 with 1 HR in 18 games in spring training, he was reassigned before the season started. On May 25, 2012, Nieves was called up to replace Ramón Hernández, who was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Nieves was hitting .299 with 3 HR and 14 RBI in 28 games with Triple-A Colorado Springs. During his time up there, he acted as a mentor to Wilin Rosario and was used to try to solve Jeremy Guthrie's problems. On July 13, Nieves was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a turf toe in his right foot. However, on August 1, he was designated for assignment to clear roster space. Nieves was hitting .298 with 1 HR and 5 RBI in 16 games. He elected free agency on August 6. =Arizona Diamondbacks= Nieves signed with the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 6, 2012. Nieves scored a two-run homer on his debut August 9, 2012 at the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 6 to 3 win. =Philadelphia Phillies = Baseball signed by Wil Nieves after Reds – Phillies game May 18, 2014 On December 4, 2013, Nieves signed with the Philadelphia Phillies. Nieves made the Phillies Opening Day roster in 2014 as the backup catcher to Carlos Ruiz. On June 18, he injured his leg while running the bases during a start against Atlanta. He exited the game, and the Phillies recalled catcher Cameron Rupp to serve as Ruiz's backup while Nieves healed. Nieves had only played in 14 games to that date, all starts to give Ruiz some rest. =Return to San Diego Padres= Nieves signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres on February 4, 2015. He made the Padres' opening day roster as back-up to catcher Derek Norris after Tim Federowicz suffered a season-ending knee injury during spring training. Nieves appeared in six games for the Padres in 2015 and collected one hit in thirteen at-bats, an April 12 grand slam against the San Francisco Giants. Nieves was designated for assignment on May 4, 2015, and chose to become a free agent. =Braves organization= The Braves signed Nieves to a minor league contract, and he batted .238 for AAA Gwinnett, but the Braves released him on June 22, 2015. Post-playing career In 2019, Nieves joined the Boston Red Sox' minor league system as a coach with the Class A-Advanced Salem Red Sox.

Gunmen stopped a minibus carrying eleven Protestant workmen, lined them up alongside it and shot them. Only one victim survived, despite having been shot 18 times. A Catholic man on the minibus was allowed to go free.1976: Ten dead in Northern Ireland ambush. A group calling itself the South Armagh Republican Action Force claimed responsibility. It said the shooting was retaliation for a string of attacks on Catholic civilians in the area by Loyalists, particularly the killing of six Catholics the night before.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. Random House, 2001. p.611 The Kingsmill massacre was the climax of a string of tit-for-tat killings in the area during the mid-1970s, and was one of the deadliest mass shootings of the Troubles. A 2011 report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) found that members of the Provisional IRA carried out the attack, despite the organisation being on ceasefire. The HET report said that the men were targeted because they were Protestants and that, although it was a response to the night before, it had been planned. The weapons used were linked to 110 other attacks. Following the massacre, the British government declared County Armagh to be a \\"Special Emergency Area\\" and hundreds of extra troops and police were deployed in the area. It also announced that the Special Air Service (SAS) was being moved into South Armagh. This was the first time that SAS presence in Northern Ireland was officially acknowledged. Background On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British government entered into a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches.Extracts from The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA by Kevin J. Kelley. Zed Books Ltd, 1988. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals wanted no part of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when they claimed to have had the Provisionals on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA. There was a rise in sectarian killings during the truce, which 'officially' lasted until February 1976. Loyalists, fearing they were about to be forsaken by the British government and forced into a united Ireland,Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.142 increased their attacks on Irish Catholics/nationalists. Loyalists killed 120 Catholics in 1975, the vast majority civilians.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus end the truce. Some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused unruliness within the IRA and some members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for-tat killings. Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) members, and current or former members of the Official IRA, were also involved. According to a police intelligence report, the Provisional IRA leadership reprimanded its South Armagh Brigade for carrying out sectarian killings.\\"Inquest told of IRA bust-up before massacre\\". Belfast Telegraph, 18 May 2017. Retrieved 10 January 2018. Between the beginning of the truce (10 February 1975) and the Kingsmill massacre, loyalist paramilitaries killed 35 Catholic civilians in County Armagh or on its borders. In that same period, republican paramilitaries killed 16 Protestant civilians and 17 members of the security forces in the same area. Many of the loyalist attacks have been linked to the Glenanne gang; an alleged secret alliance of loyalist militants, British soldiers from the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), and police officers from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). A former member of the group said they wanted to provoke a civil war, believing that when civil war erupted they could then \\"crush the other side\\".\\"UVF 'wanted to unleash civil war' with Dublin and Monaghan bombings\\". Belfast Telegraph, 12 June 2015. *On 31 July, loyalists shot five members of an Irish pop band at Buskhill, killing three. Like the Kingsmill massacre, the band's minibus had been stopped at a fake military checkpoint by gunmen in British Army uniform. Loyalists carried out two similar attacks over the following month. *On 1 September, gunmen burst into Tullyvallan Orange Hall and shot dead five Protestant civilians, all members of the Orange Order. The attack was claimed by a group calling itself the \\"South Armagh Republican Action Force\\". This was the first time the name had been used. *On 19 December, two Catholic civilians were killed and twenty injured when loyalists detonated a car bomb outside a pub in Dundalk, a few miles across the Irish border. Hours later, they killed three more Catholic civilians and injured six in a gun and bomb attack on a pub in Silverbridge.

It is believed this was a cover name used by members of the INLA. *Four days later, on 4 January 1976, loyalists shot dead six Catholic civilians in two co-ordinated attacks. They killed three members of the Reavey family at their home in Whitecross and three members of the O'Dowd family at their home in Ballydougan. The Irish News reported that the killings were revenge for the bombing in Gilford.David McKittrick, Seamus Kelters, Brian Feeney and Chris Thornton (1999), Lost Lives. Edinburgh: Mainstream Publishing, pp.606, 609 RUC officer Billy McCaughey admitted taking part and accused another officer of being involved. His colleague, John Weir, said that two police officers and a British soldier were involved. The HET report found that while the Kingsmill massacre was in \\"direct response\\" to the Reavey and O'Dowd killings, the attack was planned before that. Following the earlier loyalist attacks, republicans had apparently decided to \\"dramatically retaliate\\" if loyalists struck again. The report said \\"The murderous attacks on the Reavey and O'Dowd families were simply the catalyst for the premeditated and calculated slaughter of these innocent and defenceless men\\". The attack The bullet-riddled minibus which had been transporting the 11 Protestant workers who were gunned down as they lined up alongside the vehicle On 5 January 1976, just after 5.30 pm, a red Ford Transit minibus was carrying sixteen textile workers home from their workplace in Glenanne. Five were Catholics and eleven were Protestants. Four of the Catholics got out at Whitecross and the bus continued along the rural road to Bessbrook.Harnden, p.134 As the bus cleared the rise of a hill, it was stopped by a man in combat uniform standing on the road and flashing a torch.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. pp.188–189 The workers assumed they were being stopped and searched by the British Army. As the bus stopped, eleven gunmen in combat uniform and with blackened faces emerged from the hedges. A man \\"with a pronounced English accent\\" began talking. He ordered the workers to get out of the bus and to line up facing it with their hands on the roof.McKay, Susan. Bear in Mind These Dead. Faber & Faber, 2009. pp.78–79 He then asked \\"Who is the Catholic?\\". The only Catholic was Richard Hughes. His workmates, now fearing that the gunmen were loyalists who had come to kill him, tried to stop him from identifying himself. However, when Hughes stepped forward the gunman told him to \\"Get down the road and don't look back\\".Harnden, p.135 The lead gunman then said \\"Right\\", and the others immediately opened fire on the workers.\\"IRA responsible for Kingsmill'\\".

Belfast Newsletter, 23 June 2011. A total of 136 rounds were fired in less than a minute. The men were shot at waist-height and fell to the ground; some fell on top of each other, either dead or wounded. When the initial burst of gunfire stopped, the gunmen re-loaded their weapons. The order was given to \\"Finish them off\\", and another burst of gunfire was fired into the heaped bodies of the workmen.\\"Kingsmills was “sectarian savagery”\\". Belfast Newsletter, 17 June 2011.

After carrying out the shooting, the gunmen calmly walked away. Shortly after, a married couple came upon the scene of the killings and began praying beside the victims. They found the badly- wounded Alan Black lying in a ditch. When an ambulance arrived, Black was taken to hospital in Newry, where he was operated on and survived. The Catholic worker, Richard Hughes, had managed to stop a car and was driven to Bessbrook RUC station, where he raised the alarm. One of the first police officers on the scene was Billy McCaughey, who had taken part in the Reavey killings. He said \\"When we arrived it was utter carnage. Men were lying two or three together. Blood was flowing, mixed with water from the rain\\". Some of the Reavey family also came upon the scene of the Kingsmill massacre while driving to hospital to collect the bodies of their relatives. Johnston Chapman, the uncle of victims Reginald and Walter Chapman, said the dead workmen were \\"just lying there like dogs, blood everywhere\\". At least two of the victims were so badly mutilated by gunfire that immediate relatives were prevented from identifying them. One relative said the hospital mortuary \\"was like a butcher's shop with bodies lying on the floor like slabs of meat\\". Nine of the dead were from the village of Bessbrook, while the bus driver, Robert Walker, was from Mountnorris. Four of the men were members of the Orange Order\\"In Memory\\" , Armagh County Grand Orange Lodge website. and two were former members of the security forces: Kenneth Worton was a former Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier while Joseph Lemmon was a former Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) officer.McKittrick, David.

He said that it was retaliation for the Reavey–O'Dowd killings the night before,Interim Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay’s Tavern, Dundalk , p. 9. and that there would be \\"no further action on our part\\" if loyalists stopped their attacks. He added that the group had no connection with the IRA. The IRA denied responsibility for the killings at the time. It stated on 17 January 1976: > The Irish Republican Army has never initiated sectarian killings, and > sectarianism of any kind is abhorrent to the Republican Movement [...] If > the loyalist elements responsible for over 300 sectarian assassinations in > the past four years stop such killing now, then the question of retaliation > from whatever source will not arise.Richard English, Armed Struggle, a > History of the IRA p. 173 However, a 2011 report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) concluded that Provisional IRA members were responsible and that they had claimed the attack using a covername. It added: \\"There is some intelligence that the Provisional IRA unit responsible was not well-disposed towards central co-ordination but there is no excuse in that. These dreadful murders were carried out by the Provisional IRA and none other\\". Responding to the report, Sinn Féin spokesman Mitchel McLaughlin said that he did \\"not dispute the sectarian nature of the killings\\" but continued to believe \\"the denials by the IRA that they were involved\\".SF: Kingsmills families need truth 'like other victims' BBC News 22 June 2011Pete Baker, Sinn Féin rejects HET findings on Kingsmill massacre Slugger O'Toole 22 June 2011 SDLP Assemblyman Dominic Bradley called on Sinn Féin to \\"publicly accept that the HET's forensic evidence on the firearms used puts Provisional responsibility beyond question\\" and to stop \\"deny[ing] that the Provisional IRA was in the business of organising sectarian killings on a large scale\\".Bradley: Kingsmills is Sinn Fein’s truth test sdlp.ie newsroom 20 June 2011 According to journalist Toby Harnden, the British Military Intelligence assessment was that the attack was carried out by local IRA members \\"who were acting outside the normal IRA command structure\\".Harnden, PB, Coronet Books, 2000 p. 187 According to Harnden, RUC files suggest that 14 IRA members – including future 'Real IRA' leader Michael McKevitt – had met on New Year's Eve to plan the attack.Harnden p.136 Harnden quotes an alleged South Armagh IRA member, Volunteer M, who said that \\"IRA members were ordered by their leaders to carry out the Kingsmill massacre\\".Harnden p.137 Harnden also quotes Sean O'Callaghan, an IRA member who worked for the security forces as a double agent. O'Callaghan claims that IRA Chief of Staff, Seamus Twomey, authorised the attack after Brian Keenan argued it was the only way to prevent more Catholics being killed. However, O'Callaghan says the two men did not consult the IRA Army Council about the attack. Ruairí Ó Brádaigh claims that he and Twomey only learned of the Kingsmill attack after it had happened.Robert W. White, Ruairi O Bradaigh, the life and politics of an Irish Revolutionary, p. 386 According to a police intelligence report, the IRA Army Council reprimanded the South Armagh Brigade six weeks before the massacre for carrying out sectarian killings. Two AR-18 rifles used in the shooting were found by the British Army in 1990 near Cullyhanna and forensically tested. It was reported that the rifles were linked to 17 killings in South Armagh from 1974 to 1990.Harnden, Bandit County (1999) p.136 Further ballistic studies found that guns used in the attack were linked to 37 killings, 22 attempted killings, 19 non-fatal shootings and 11 finds of spent cartridges between 1974 and 1989. The attacks all took place within the same area and it is likely they were carried out by the same small group. =Informer claims= In 2012, a secret Royal Military Police (RMP) document shown to the Sunday World newspaper revealed that the gunman who finished off the dying men could have been arrested five months later. The document says that the man (referred to as 'P') was wounded when British soldiers engaged an IRA unit near the Mountain House Inn in South Armagh on 25 June 1976. He managed to flee over the border and was treated at Louth County Hospital, but the other three IRA members were captured within hours. According to the RMP document, two of them named 'P' as the fourth member. Two of the guns captured had been used in the Kingsmill massacre. The RMP document reveals that the security forces knew 'P' was being treated at the hospital but \\"made no attempt to have him arrested and extradited\\". This has led to suspicions that 'P', \\"who has never been prosecuted despite extensive paramilitary involvement\\", was a British agent. Alan Black, the only survivor of Kingsmill, believes that IRA members involved in the massacre were double agents working for the British state. He believes there was a \\"cover up\\" and that British security forces knew the massacre was going to happen but allowed it to. Karen Armstrong, sister of victim John McConville, said: \\"A lot of people were being protected back then and they still are\\".\\"Kingsmill massacre survivor pleads for 'truth and justice'\\". Belfast Telegraph, 5 January 2016. It has been suggested that the gunman with the English accent could have been British Intelligence officer Robert Nairac.\\"HET 'will question 'Kingsmills suspects\\".

Bear in Mind These Dead. Faber & Faber, 2009. p.182 =Ian Paisley's claims= Immediately after the Kingsmill attack, some members of the security forces began a campaign of harassment against the Reavey family, and accused Eugene Reavey of organising the massacre.\\"Disgusting justification for sectarian murders\\". The Irish News, 31 January 2007. His three brothers had been shot by loyalists the day before. Eugene and some of his family happened upon the scene of the Kingsmill massacre while driving to hospital to collect his brothers' bodies.McKay, Susan. \\"Bitter hatreds that underpin Love Ulster parade in Dublin\\". Irish Times, 25 February 2005. \\"The bodies of the murdered workmen were being brought into the mortuary when he arrived. He went into the room where the shattered families were gathering, and wept with them\\". In 1999, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Ian Paisley stated in the House of Commons that Eugene Reavey was a \\"well-known republican\\" and had \\"set up the Kingsmills massacre\\". Paisley made the claims under parliamentary privilege, which meant he could not be prosecuted for his remarks. He claimed to be quoting from a \\"police dossier\\" but it is believed to have been an Ulster Defence Regiment intelligence file.House of Commons Hansard Debates for 27 Jan 1999 (pt 32) Commons Hansard. 27 January 1999. Paisley's claims were flatly rejected by Reavey and by the only survivor of the massacre, Alan Black. Susan McKay wrote in the Irish Times that, on hearing Paisley's accusations, Black went straight to the Reaveys' house and told Reavey that he knew he was innocent. The then Northern Ireland deputy first minister, the SDLP's Seamus Mallon, expressed outrage at Paisley's claims. Ronnie Flanagan, chief constable of the RUC, said there was \\"no evidence whatsoever\\" to connect Reavey with the massacre, and that no police file contained any such allegation.Irish Times, 25 February 2006. In January 2007, the police's Historical Enquiries Team (HET) apologised to the Reavey family for security forces allegations that Reavey had been involved in the Kingsmill attack.Innocent's sorry call to Paisley; MURDER SLUR by Laura Armstrong Despite this, the allegation continued to be promoted by local unionist activist Willie Frazer of Families Acting for Innocent Relatives (FAIR).Sectarianism and hatred only winners in city riot, by Susan McKay, The Irish News, 28 February 2006; see also: Morris, Alison. 18 January 2007 Paisley called on to apologise to murdered brother's family, Irish News; see also McKay, Susan. 30 January 2007 Disgusting justification for sectarian murders. Irish News In May 2010, the HET released a report which exonerated the three Reavey brothers and their family of any links to paramilitarism, leading Eugene Reavey to demand an apology from Paisley for his comments.UTV 19 May 2010. Paisley died in 2014 without withdrawing his allegations. Reactions and aftermath The massacre was condemned by the British and Irish governments, the main political parties and Catholic and Protestant church leaders. Merlyn Rees, the British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, condemned the massacre and forecast that the violence would escalate, saying \\"This is the way it will go on unless someone in their right senses stops it, it will go on\\".\\"Assassins gun 10 to death\\". The Guardian, 6 January 1976. The British government immediately declared County Armagh a \\"Special Emergency Area\\" and deployed hundreds of extra troops and police in the area. A battalion of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) was called out and the Spearhead Battalion was sent into the area.The New Counter-insurgency Era in Critical Perspective. Palgrave Macmillan, 2014. p.162 Two days after the massacre, the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson announced that the Special Air Service (SAS) was being sent into South Armagh. This was the first time that SAS operations in Northern Ireland was officially acknowledged. It is believed that some SAS personnel had already been in Northern Ireland for a few years.Harnden, p. 158 Units and personnel under SAS control are alleged to have been involved in loyalist attacks.English, p.172 The Kingsmill massacre was the last in the series of sectarian killings in South Armagh during the mid-1970s. According to Willie Frazer of FAIR, this was as a result of deal between the local UVF and IRA groups.Harnden, p. 140 =Loyalist response= Loyalists allegedly planned to attack St Lawrence O'Toole Primary School in Belleeks as retaliation for the massacre There were no immediate revenge attacks by loyalists but in the 2000s it emerged that local UVF members had plotted to kill 30 Catholic schoolchildren as retaliation, by attacking St Lawrence O'Toole Primary School in Belleeks. The loyalists were members of the \\"Glenanne gang\\", which had carried out the Reavey–O'Dowd killings and included RUC and UDR members. The attack was allegedly called off because the UVF leadership ruled it would be \\"morally unacceptable\\" and would lead to a harsh IRA response and likely civil war. Allegedly, the leadership also suspected that the member who suggested the attack was working with British Military Intelligence and that Military Intelligence were seeking to provoke a civil war. The plot was revealed by two former Glenanne gang members, including Billy McCaughey, who admitted the plot in a 2004 documentary.Spotlight: Dangerous Liaisons. BBC Northern Ireland. 25 May 2004. Another UVF gang, the \\"Shankill Butchers\\", also planned retaliation for the massacre. This gang, led by Lenny Murphy, operated in Belfast and was notorious for its late-night kidnapping, torture and murder (by throat slashing) of random Catholic civilians. Murphy planned to attack a lorry that ferried Catholic workmen to Corry's Timber Yard in West Belfast, shooting all on board. Murphy abandoned the plan after the workers changed their route and transport. Some loyalists claim the Kingsmill massacre is the reason they joined paramilitary groups. One was Billy Wright, who said, > I was 15 when those workmen were pulled out of that bus and shot dead. I was > a Protestant and I realised that they had been killed simply because they > were Protestants. I left Mountnorris, came back to Portadown and immediately > joined the youth wing of the UVF.Harnden, p.140 He became commander of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade in the early 1990s; Wright later founded the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) in 1996. He was suspected of at least 20 sectarian killings of Catholics in the 1980s and 1990s. Another with similar claims was RUC Special Patrol Group officer Billy McCaughey, who was one of the first RUC officers on the scene of the massacre. He told Toby Harnden, \\"the sides of the road were running red with blood and it was the blood of totally innocent Protestants\\". Afterwards, McCaughey says, he began passing RUC intelligence to loyalist militants and also to participate in their operations. McCaughey was convicted in 1980 of a sectarian killing, the kidnapping of a Catholic priest and an attempted bombing.Harnden, p. 138-140, incl. both previous quotes McCaughey had colluded with loyalists before the Kingsmill attack and later admitted taking part in the Reavey killings the day before, he claimed he \\"was at the house but fired no shots\\".Interim Report of the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Bombing of Kay’s Tavern, Dundalk July, 2006 , p. 122. McCaughey also gave his view on how the massacre affected loyalists, > I think Kingsmills forced people to ask themselves where they were going, > especially the Protestant support base, the civilian support base – the > people who were not members of the UVF but would let you use a building or a > field. Those people, many of them withdrew. It wasn't because of anything > the UVF did. It was fear of retaliation. No one was charged in relation to the Kingsmill massacre. In August 2003, there were calls for the Police Service of Northern Ireland to reopen the files relating to the massacre. =Republican response= The IRA denied involvement in the attack but the double agent Sean O'Callaghan and others have alleged it was ordered by two IRA leaders, other republican leaders were reported to be very unhappy about it. According to O'Callaghan, Gerry Adams said in an Army Council meeting, \\"there'll never again be another Kingsmill\\".Harnden, p.134, but see also Robert W. White, p.386, above. One South Armagh IRA member allegedly resigned in disgust at the massacre. Toby Harnden said that IRA members in South Armagh who talked to him in the late 1990s generally condemned the massacre. One, Volunteer G, was quoted as saying that he \\"never agreed with Kingsmill\\". Another, Volunteer M, was quoted as saying that it was \\"a gut reaction [to the killing of Catholics] and a wrong one. The worst time in my life was in jail after Kingsmill. It was a dishonourable time\\". Republican activist Peter John Caraher said that those ultimately responsible were \\"the loyalists who shot the Reavey brothers\\". He added, \\"It was sad that those people [at Kingsmill] had to die, but I'll tell you something, it stopped any more Catholics being killed\\".Harnden p. 137–138, see also CAIN webservice. This view was reiterated by a County Tyrone republican and Gaelic Athletic Association veteran who spoke to Ed Moloney. \\"It's a lesson you learn quickly on the football field... If you're fouled, you hit back\\".A Secret History of the IRA, Ed Moloney, 2002. (9PB) , (HB) , p. 320 Colin Worton, whose brother was killed in the massacre, said \\"Kingsmill did stop Catholics being killed in South Armagh, but that doesn't justify it\\". Sinn Féin politician John O'Dowd later condemned the massacre as \\"shameful\\" and was backed by his party colleagues. O'Dowd's uncle and two of his cousins had been shot dead by loyalists in the day before the massacre. Commemoration There is a memorial in Bessbrook dedicated to 'The Innocent Victims Murdered at Kingsmills'. For many years after the massacre there was a small memorial at the site of the massacre. A new and much larger memorial was built there in 2012. This memorial has been vandalised and it is claimed there was an attempt to \\"intimidate\\" the builders. The following year, Northern Ireland's Environment Minister Alex Attwood (of the SDLP) apologised after his Department mistakenly sent a letter to the landowner demanding it be removed for lack of planning permission. Unionist politician William Irwin criticised the Department and said it had not taken action against \\"illegal roadside terrorist memorials\\" erected by republicans. In February 2012, controversy arose when Willie Frazer of FAIR proposed a \\"March for Justice\\" in which the victims' relatives, along with 11 loyalist bands, would follow the route taken by the workmen the night they were killed. This would have meant passing through the mainly Catholic village of Whitecross and past the homes of the Reavey family, where the three brothers had been killed the night before the massacre.\\"Tensions raised ahead of ruling\\" Newry Democrat Over 200 people opposed the march at a meeting with the Parades Commission in Whitecross. Local SDLP and Sinn Féin politicians also opposed it, saying it would raise sectarian tension in the area.\\"Fury at Kingsmills march opposition\\" The Newsletter The Parades Commission approved the march on condition that there be no marching bands, flags, banners or placards. One organiser received a death threat telling him that he would be shot and his church would be burnt if the march went ahead.\\"Pastor threatened over Kingsmill march\\" UTV News The organisers postponed the march; a move that was welcomed by local nationalist politicians and by Ulster Unionist politician Danny Kennedy.\\"Kingsmills memorial march postponed\\" UTV News See also * List of massacres in the United Kingdom * List of massacres in Ireland * Miami Showband massacre, a similar ambush on a minibus during The Troubles.

The son of a merchant, he early showed ability, and entered the ministry of finance, where he rose rapidly; in 1784, at the time of the renewal of the arrangements with the tax-farmers-general, he was practically chief in that department and made terms advantageous to the national exchequer. Under Calonne he improved the returns from the farmers-general; and he was largely instrumental in bringing about the erection of the octroi walls of Paris in place of the insufficient wooden barriers. He, however, advocated an abolition of some of the restrictions on imports, as came about in the Anglo-French commercial treaty of 1786, to the conclusion of which he contributed in no small measure. The events of the French Revolution threatened at times to overwhelm Mollien. In 1794 he was brought before the revolutionary tribunal of Évreux as a suspect, and narrowly escaped the fate that befell many of the former farmers-general. He retired to England, where he observed the financial measures adopted at the crisis of 1796-1797. After the coup d'état of 18 Brumaire (November 1799) he re-entered the ministry of finance, then under Gaudin, who entrusted to him important duties as director of the new caisse d'amortissement. Napoleon, hearing of his abilities, frequently consulted him on financial matters, and after the Proclamation of the Empire (May 1804) made him a councillor of state (Napoleon also had regular affairs with Mollien's wife). The severe financial crisis of December 1805 to January 1806 served to reveal once more his sound sense. Napoleon, returning in haste not long after the Battle of Austerlitz, dismissed Barbé-Marbois from the ministry of the treasury and confided to Mollien those important duties. He soon succeeded in freeing the treasury from the interference of great banking houses. In other respects, however, he did something towards curbing Napoleon's desire for a precise regulation of the money market. The conversations between them on this subject, as reported in Mollien's Mémoirs, are of high interest, and show that the ministry had a far truer judgement on financial matters than the emperor, who often twitted him with being an ideologue. In 1808 Mollien was awarded the title of count. He soon came to see the impossibility of the measures termed collectively the Continental System; but his warnings on that subject were of no avail. After the first abdication of the emperor (11 April 1814), Mollien retired into private life, but took up his ministerial duties at the appeal of Napoleon during the Hundred Days (1815), after which he again retired. Louis XVIII wished to bring him back to office, but he resisted these appeals. Nominated a peer in 1819, he took some part in connection with the annual budgets. He lived to see the election of Louis-Napoleon as president of the Second Republic, and died in April 1850; with the exception of Étienne Denis Pasquier, he was the last surviving minister of Napoleon Bonaparte.

He relocated to Canada to teach at the University of Victoria in Canada in 2006. He claims to have been fired for encouraging students to criticize British environmentalist George Monbiot in 2008. Until spring 2010, Dolan was an associate professor of English composition and literature at the American University of Iraq - Sulaimani. He subsequently taught English as a Second Language in Najran, Saudi Arabia, until he was fired for one of the War Nerd Articles, and shortly after from East Timor, where he was fired for writing an article on the Indonesian occupation of Timor. Recently he has been living in Europe, where he was finishing work on his now-published retelling of The Iliad. Gary Brecher Gary Brecher is a character invented by Dolan to be the pseudonymous author of The War Nerd column, which first appeared in The eXile, discussing current wars and other military conflicts from the perspective of a \\"war fan\\",\\"Conceived in Sin: The Online Audience and the Case of the eXile\\", linuxmafia.com, April 2005 (reposting from original eXile article). and later for NSFWCorp, and PandoDaily. \\"Crude, scatological, un-P.C., yet deeply informed\\",War Nerd, amazon.com; accessed August 7, 2017. he analyzes military strategy, tactics, and contexts of ongoing and past conflicts. A collection of his columns was published by Soft Skull Press in June 2008 (). Brecher's identity was mostly secret throughout the run of The eXile from 1997 to 2008. He was suspected to be Dolan as early as 2005Review of 'Pleasant Hell' , Buffalo Beast, December 14, 2005. and by 2010 Dolan was openly discussing his alter ego. =Revelation of identity= The fictional version of Brecher's identity, referenced from his first column,\\"Meet the War Nerd.\\" Exiled Online, April 21, 2002; retrieved August 7, 2017. was that he was employed as a data entry clerk in Fresno, California and deeply unsatisfied with his job. Mark Ames, editor of The eXile offered Brecher a column as a \\"war reviewer\\". Brecher wrote that life in Fresno was a \\"death sentence\\" and that he spent 15 hours a day in front of a computer (\\"6 or 7 hours entering civilian numbers for the paycheck and the rest surfing the war news\\"). In a Dolan article in The eXile about the newspaper and \\"the strange being known as the War Nerd\\" (mythologizing Brecher as a separate person to Dolan), Brecher is described as a community-college dropout, and \\"fat, miserable, and incidentally brilliant\\". The first hint that Brecher was Dolan was perhaps in a 2001 eXile article, \\"Cleanse the World\\", in which Dolan openly admitted to being a \\"war nerd\\": \\"Oh, my poor naive war-nerd brothers, how could you ever have dreamed that Bush.\\"Cleanse the World, exile.ru (2001). The columns were the only source of information on Brecher until an email interview with him conducted by Steve Sailer was published by United Press International.Sailer, Steve.War Nerd's Interview with UPI (March 2003), exile.ru; accessed August 7, 2017. Brecher's reclusive nature and the lack of information about him raised speculation during the interview that Brecher was a pseudonym for another eXile contributor. The use of invented characters was not unprecedented for the eXile.\\"Feis the Music!\\" (2003), eXile.ru; accessed August 7, 2017. Researchers of the original Wikipedia Gary Brecher page found the photoThis is the original (perhaps stock image) photo that Brecher's illustration was clearly modelled upon (via the Internet archive). on which the illustration at the top of each War Nerd column, supposedly representing Brecher, was based. It was actually that of Roger Edvardsen the tour manager of the Norwegian rhythm & blues band Ehem. One of the page authors emailed the band, and they confirmed the image was of Edvardsen. Brecher participated in radio interviews including a April 5, 2008, interview by Chuck Mertz on the Evanston/Chicago radio station WNUR and a May 25, 2008 interview by Steve Paulson on Wisconsin Public Radio. A review in the Buffalo Beast of Dolan's novel/memoir Pleasant Hell stated that \\"a faithful eXile reader [would] have to be as dense as young John Dolan not to realize you're reading about the birth of 'Gary Brecher' – nome [sic] de guerre of the famed 'War Nerd'.\\" In the memoir, Dolan writes of obsessively studying military history and Jane's manuals while binging on junk food in the basement of a UC Berkeley library building in the mid-seventies. In one War Nerd column, Brecher writes, \\"I used to spend every free hour, back before there was an internet, going over those big heavy reference books in the library: Jane's Tanks, Jane's Missile Systems, Jane's Combat Vehicles.\\"\\"Most Valuable Weapon: the RPG\\" (2001), eXile.ru; accessed August 7, 2017. On June 25, 2008, the following revelation was published within a short book review on Philadelphia CityPaper.net: \\"But the War Nerd is, in fact, neither of those things. He is not even Gary Brecher! Brecher is the creation of John Dolan, a poet, novelist, lecturer in English at the University of Victoria, and The eXile co-editor. That's very exciting news for the War Nerd's regular readers: The columns you've been dissecting and debating for the last six years were written by an English professor who writes poetry!\\"Fertig, Tami (July 10–16, 2008). Review of \\"War Nerd\\" by Gary Brecher – 4th review from top in Non- Fiction Reviews, first published June 25, 2008; retrieved April 9, 2017. On November 2, 2010, in an interview with Scott Horton for Antiwar Radio, John Dolan spoke for the first time about his Gary Brecher alter-ego which he described as being strongly based on his younger self. During the interview, he described Gary Brecher \\"as a more honest version of who I really am\\". =War Nerd writings= Every two to five weeks, Brecher published his War Nerd column in The eXile. In each installment, Brecher offered his idiosyncratic analyses of armed conflict from a military, political, or (rarely) social standpoint. In his first eXile column, Brecher declared that The War Nerd was to be \\"a column on how all the wars are going, kind of a war reviewer.\\" He has since migrated to the subscription-only Radio War Nerd podcast, :\\"American peace truly sucks (That's what I live in and work in: American peace. Fresno. Townhouses in a dry riverbed. Scrub acreage with fancy British names. America the hot and stupid).\\" :\\"That's why we need a war now and then. You can drain your dick at every bondage site on the web, but you can't really drain your head there, it takes something bigger like a decent war and some of those guncamera shots. I figure about one a year. Which is why this was already a good year.\\" Following publication of Brecher's article, \\"Victor Hanson: Portrait of an American Traitor\\", Hanson responded with an article accusing Brecher of being an anarchist. In the September 9, 2005 of The eXile, the editors announced that the War Nerd would be suspended without pay for one issue as a result of these accusations. It is doubtful that this was a serious reprimand. Nonetheless, the subsequent issue of The eXile did not contain Brecher's regular column. Another similarly themed Brecher article, \\"It's All Greek to Victor Davis Hanson\\", appeared in the December 19, 2005 issue of The American Conservative. Brecher has summarized his view of modern warfare as follows: # Most wars are asymmetrical/irregular. # In these wars, the guerrillas/irregulars/insurgents do not aim for military victory. # You cannot defeat these groups by killing lots of their members. In fact, they want you to do that. # Hi-tech weaponry is mostly useless in these wars. # \\"Hearts and minds,\\" meaning propaganda and morale, are more important than military superiority. # Most people are not rational, they are TRIBAL: \\"my gang yay, your gang boo!\\" It really is that simple.

He was the 2006 Republican nominee for U.S. Senator from New York and lost to incumbent Democrat Hillary Clinton. Early life, military service and education Spencer was born in Yonkers, New York, the son of Edward and Ann McGlinchy Spencer. He was adopted and raised by Patrick and Nora Ginnane, who had eight children of their own. His adoptive mother died when he was eight, his adoptive father six years later. His sister Noreen Ginnane raised him. He attended high school at Sacred Heart High School and after two years at Westchester Community College, he dropped out to join the United States Army during the Vietnam War. He earned an officer's commission as an infantry lieutenant and served a tour in Vietnam during 1968 through 1969. He holds the Combat Infantryman Badge and the Bronze Star. Early career Spencer married Eileen Looney in 1971, and the couple went on to have two children. Spencer worked in construction, real estate property management with Cushman & Wakefield, and as vice president of real estate management with Bankers Trust Co. He then entered politics as a member of the Yonkers City Council in 1991. He served 6 years on City Council, with 4 years as Republican majority leader. Spencer also was the founder of Spencer Consulting Group, where he uses his personal experience of overcoming alcoholism to help others defeat their addictions. Mayor of Yonkers In 1996, John Spencer was sworn in as mayor of Yonkers. The city's finances had been under the oversight of a State Emergency Financial Control Board for more than a decade. Mayor Spencer insisted that the City had met its obligations and called for the removal of the New York State Control Board. In 1998, control of the city's finances was returned to the city. The City was under a Federal Desegregation Order from a landmark decision of the federal Courts (Judge Sand, c. 1984), and Mayor Spencer had said that it was time to end Federal Control of Housing and Education in the City. Judge Sand agreed and after negotiations gave control back to the City on both issues, thus ending the Federal role in Yonkers. Mayor Spencer presided over development in Yonkers. Retail and housing were built on the downtown waterfront, a new library was completed, along with the Austin Avenue development of Costco, Home Depot, and Stew Leonard's. As part of the New State Control Board leaving, Mayor Spencer also went on to cut the Income Tax Surcharge by 2/3 and cut the Real Estate transfer tax from 3% to 1%, thus forcing the city to raise property taxes to make up the difference. His mayoral chief of staff Kathy Spring bore him two children and later had a third in 2005. Spring's annual salary started at $52,000, and increased to $138,000 by the time Spencer left office. In November 2003, Spencer could not run for re-election as mayor due to the term limits law that he himself championed and then tried to rescind. Mayor Spencer's deputy mayor Phil Amicone sought the office of Mayor with the support of Spencer, and successfully defeated Assemblyman Michael Spano in a Republican primary, and then went on to defeat Democratic candidate Joe Farmer in the general election. 2006 New York Senate race In 2005, Spencer announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate seat held by Democrat Hillary Clinton, who was seeking re-election to a second term. Politically, Spencer is opposed to abortion and gun control, and a supporter of tighter border security.Issues - Spencer for Senate URL accessed 2006-04-17 His support for the Bush administration and its policies is well known, including but not limited to the war in Iraq. On August 18, 2005, Spencer gave a radio interview where he said Westchester County, New York District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, another candidate for the Republican nomination, didn't have a \\"Chinaman's chance\\" of getting the Conservative line. Spencer was asked to apologize for the comment after an outcry from the Asian community that the statement was derogatory. Pirro dropped out of the race in December 2005. On May 31, 2006, Spencer won the endorsement of the state Republican Party organization but did not achieve the threshold of 75 percent he needed to exclude his rival, former Pentagon aide Kathleen Troia \\"K.T.\\" McFarland, from the primary ballot. He received 63 percent, and thus faced McFarland in the September 12, 2006 Republican primary, which he won by a margin of almost two to one.Primary 2006 Spencer called on McFarland to step aside after the vote, but McFarland told CQPolitics.com she had no intention of withdrawing from the race. In a June 2006 radio ad, Spencer expressed his disappointment in the national Republicans for not helping his Senate campaign. In his 2006 election campaign, Spencer came out in favor of a New York Court of Appeals decision rejecting the claim of 42 gay and lesbian couples that same-sex marriage as constitutional right. On Kevin McCullough's talk radio program, Spencer said marriage is \\"between a man and a woman\\" and that a constitutional amendment is needed to enshrine that. Clinton spent $36 million for her re-election, more than any other candidate for Senate in the 2006 elections. Polls during the general election campaign generally showed Clinton with a 20-point lead or better over Spencer. On November 7, 2006, Clinton won easily, garnering 67% of the vote to Spencer's 31%. In 2006, former mayor Spencer was sued in civil court by a former City of Yonkers employee, Joan Gronowski, who later served as a city council member, who stated that she was told not to engage in political campaign activities while working for the city. Following a jury verdict, a $75,000 judgement against the city was narrowly affirmed in a 3–2 split decision.Matter of Gronowski v. Spencer.

The objective was to drive the German 15th Army back across the rivers Roer and Wurm and move the frontline further into Germany. The operation was carried out by Lieutenant-General Neil Ritchie's XII Corps by three divisions: the 7th Armoured Division (Major-General Lewis Lyne), the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division (Major-General Ivor Thomas) and the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division (Major-General Edmund Hakewill-Smith). The operation, named after the Scottish black male grouse, is relatively unknown despite the sometimes fierce battles that were fought for each and every village and hamlet within the Roer Triangle.British Report about Operation Blackcock (PDF, 74 pages) Dispositions along the Roer Front By the end of 1944, the frontline in Dutch Limburg had stabilized along several natural barriers. By far the most difficult barrier to cross was the River Maas running along the Dutch - Belgian border. The next barrier was the River Roer, running from the German Eifel area through Heinsberg towards Roermond, where it joins the Maas. From Heinsberg, southwards the famous Siegfried Line or 'West Wall' was formed along the banks of the Rur. Dutch South-Limburg was already liberated in September by the First United States Army, but the area above the Sittard - Geilenkirchen line was still in German hands. Here the front had settled along the \\"Saefeller Beek\\", a small creek forming another seemingly immense obstacle. These obstacles formed a triangular area, indeed; it was referred to as the Roermond Triangle, which protruded like a small bulge into the frontline. As a result of the German offensive - Operation Herbstnebel - in the Ardennes (also known as the Battle of the Bulge), the Allies had to withdraw resources to stop the German advance in the American First Army's sector. Therefore, the British Second Army's XII Corps, had taken over the task of guarding the frontline north of Sittard for the US Army. The Maas front was guarded by the British VIII Corps. The British XII Corps was facing the German XII SS Corps, commanded by Günther Blumentritt, which had two infantry divisions present along the frontline between Geilenkirchen and Roermond. In the Roermond area these divisions were strengthened by the Fallschirmjäger-Regiment Hübner. Concept of the Operation The clearing of the Roer Triangle was planned along three axes. The left axis, formed by the 7th Armoured Division, was aimed at capturing the bridge across the Roer in Sint Odiliënberg (). For the 7th Armoured Division, the operation would start with bridging the creeks south of Susteren. The centre axis, formed by the 52nd Infantry Division, was aimed at the capture of Heinsberg. In order to do this, a break-through at the German defence line was to be undertaken near Hongen in order to open the road between Sittard and Heinsberg for moving troops. The right axis, formed by the 43rd Infantry Division, was aimed at clearing the area south-east of Dremmen. This axis would use the break in the German defence line that was to be created by the Lowland Division. =VC Actions= The Victoria Cross was awarded twice, both posthumously, for actions during Operation Blackcock. * Fusilier Dennis Donnini of the 4/5 Royal Scots Fusiliers, 52nd Lowland Division, received the VC after his heroic actions in the village of Stein in Selfkant on 18 January. Fusilier Donnini is buried at the Sittard War Cemetery (Netherlands). * Lance Corporal Henry Eric Harden of the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC), a medical orderly attached to 45 Commando, was awarded the VC for his heroic action during the bitter fighting at the Dutch villages of Brachterbeek and Linne on 23 January. Lance Corporal Harden is buried at Nederweert War Cemetery (Netherlands). =Hübner's defeat at Sint Joost= The Battle for the Dutch village of Sint Joost was a turning point in Operation Blackcock. After four days of fighting, the Germans were well aware that the armoured division that was facing them relied heavily on the roads to manoeuvre their vehicles, especially due to poor winter conditions. The small village of Sint Joost was on the route of the 7th Armoured Division's drive north towards Montfort. On 20 January, in cold and misty weather, infantry and cavalry units of the Desert Rats launched a first attack on the (assumed) two German companies of the 2nd Battalion Fallschirmjäger Regiment Hübner in Sint Joost. It would take four attacks to clear the village, the final assault taking place on Sunday, the 21 January. Soldier firing on German positions during 12th Corp's offensive north of Sittard, 16 January 1945 In total, sixty Fallschirmjäger were taken prisoner. The 9th Durham Light Infantry and 1st Rifle Brigade had suffered heavy losses in Sint Joost. The DLI suffered 33 casualties, of which eight were killed in action. The Rifle Brigade counted 34 casualties, of which three men from I Company were killed in action. More than one hundred German soldiers died, most of them lying in the houses. Those paratroopers who were not killed only dared to leave the cellars under safe cover of the civilians, afraid that they would be shot by the victors. Hübner had lost one company and a second had been nearly destroyed. =The Bombing Raids on Montfort= Between Friday evening the 19 January and Tuesday the 23 January the Dutch village of Montfort was shelled or bombed on seven occasions, and was hit by more than 100 bombs. Most of these fell in the centre of the village. Nearly all of the 250 houses were damaged. Some houses were no more than ruins, and entire families were killed. During these raids the Germans took shelter in the cellars among the civilians, and in the wooded areas just outside the village. The bombing raids that struck Montfort on the 21st and 22nd were carried out by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) 2nd Tactical Air Force - No. 83 Group - 143 Wing. This Wing consisted of 438, 439 and 440 Squadron, based at Eindhoven. The squadrons were equipped with the Hawker Typhoon 1B fighter bomber. 143 Wing lost six aircraft during Operation Blackcock, two of which crashed in Montfort. When Montfort was finally liberated by the \\"Desert Rats\\" on 24 January, the civilians were in a deep state of shock. The air raids on Montfort had cost the lives of 186 civilians, most of them buried under their destroyed homes. Aftermath Operation Blackcock was a success for the Allies since all the objectives of the operation were met. The German divisions were thrown out of the Roer Triangle with the exception of the area immediately south of Roermond. Here Hübner's paratroopers stayed in control for the time being. The British Division that fought the toughest battles during the operation was without doubt the 52nd Lowland which counted 752 casualties. Of these 101 were killed. 258 soldiers were transported from the front because of sickness, mostly as a direct result of the adverse weather conditions and the extreme cold. The 7th Armoured Division counted just over 400 casualties. The Desert Rats losses in vehicles was rather light, with only 20 tanks knocked out by the enemy and a further 23 broken down due to mechanical problems. Of the knocked-out tanks 10 were damaged beyond repair. The number of German casualties is unknown, it can be estimated to be approximately 2,000. During the operation 490 prisoners were taken by the Desert Rats, amongst them were six officers. The Lowland Division took more than 1,200 prisoners, the Wessex Division took some 400 soldiers captive. Monument as part of the mass grave of the 186 victims of the bombing raids at the cemetery of Montfort Once Operation Blackcock was completed, the plans for the capture of the Rhineland could commence. Operation Veritable, by the First Canadian Army, was launched on the 8 February and was aimed at breaking through the German defences in the Klever Reichswald, some north of the Roer Triangle. Operation Grenade, the southern part of the pincer movement, by the US Ninth Army was launched on 23 February. General William Hood Simpson's US Ninth Army crossed the river Roer south of Heinsberg in the early hours of 23 February 1945. Twelve hours later Simpson had 16 battalions on the east bank, together with seven heavy bridges, and a number of light assault bridges. American losses were light on the first day; 700 prisoners were taken. A task force was formed by Ninth Army's XVI Corps which rushed towards Venlo to meet- up with the British in the north. On 1 March Roermond was captured by the reconnaissance troop of the US 35th Infantry Division (the \\"Santa Fe\\" Division) without a single shot being fired.

Born into a middle-class family living at Akola city in Maharashtra state in India, she was interested in spiritual matters from an early age. She pursued this interest with meditation and spiritual practices throughout her youth.Adams, Shanti, \\"The Challenge of Emptiness,\\" in What Is Enlightenment? magazine, issue 10, Fall/Winter 1996 She post graduated in Eastern and Western philosophy, Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan was one of her professors. Later she became active in the Bhoodan (Land Gift) Program. This program, led by Vinoba Bhave, persuaded landlords to give land to poor farmers. Through the 1950s, several million acres of farmland were so redistributed.D. Mackenzie Brown, Indian Political Thought from Ranade to Bhave, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970) p. 183 She travelled India to its length and breadth. In 1958, Thakar attended talks given by, and met with, the philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurti. This meeting was to change her life. She left the Land-Gift movement to dedicate herself to what she called \\"the internal problem\\"--the spiritual liberation of the individual.Parish, Chris, \\"Set Them On Fire: Portrait of a Modern Sage\\" in What Is Enlightenment? magazine, issue 10, Fall/Winter 1996 She dedicated herself to teaching meditation and philosophy, traveling between India, the U.S. and Europe. In 1979, she rekindled her passion for social activism, traveling through India and founding centers to educate villagers in agro-centered industries, sanitation, local self-government, and active democratic citizenship. Her teachings came to emphasize balancing 'inner' spiritual development with 'outer' social development, an evolution reflected in her 1984 book \\"Spirituality and Social Action: A Holistic Approach.\\"Mimi Albert, \\"Translating Spirituality Into Social Action: Profile of Vimala Thakar,\\" in Yoga Journal Issue 70, Sept-Oct 1986, p.62.

She was living at Mount Abu, Rajasthan, India during her last years.  Philosophical views  Vimala Thakar’s philosophy was influenced by the spiritual teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti and the nonviolent social change philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and Vinobe Bhave. She sought to reconcile the often separated worlds of spirituality and social action,Mimi Albert, \\"Translating Spirituality Into Social Action: Profile of Vimala Thakar,\\" in Yoga Journal Issue 70, Sept-Oct 1986, p.62. arguing that in fact each is indispensable to the other: “In this era, to become a spiritual inquirer without social consciousness is a luxury that we can ill afford, and to be a social activist without a scientific understanding of the inner workings of the mind is the worst folly. Neither approach in isolation has had any significant success. There is no question now that an inquirer will have to make an effort to be socially conscious or that an activist will have to be persuaded of the moral crisis in the human psyche, the significance of being attentive to the inner life. The challenge awaiting us is to go much deeper as human beings, to abandon superficial prejudices and preferences, to expand understanding to a global scale, integrating the totality of living, and to become aware of the wholeness of which we are a manifestation.”Thakar, Vimala, \\"Awakening to Total Revolution\\" in What Is Enlightenment? magazine Issue 19, Spring/Summer 2001. She has also pointed out that intense self-education and transformation are naturally, in themselves, valid and very significant forms of social action. She recognized that some of us have a more inward, meditative orientation. She addressed these issues in depth at times, including with the book Vimalaji on Intensive Self-Education.

Critics studying The Protocols of the Elders of Zion have argued that he was the author of the work. This claim is reinforced by the writings of modern Russian historian Mikhail Lepekhine, who in 1999 studied previously closed French archives stored in Moscow containing information supporting Golovinski's authorship. Back in the mid-1930s, Russian testimony in the Berne Trial had linked the head of Russian security service in Paris, Pyotr Rachkovsky, to the creation of The Protocols. Life Matvei Golovinski was born into an aristocratic family in the village of Ivashevka (Ивашевка), in the Syzransky Uyezd of the Simbirsk Governorate of the Russian Empire. His father, Vasili Golovinski (Василий Головинский) was a friend of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Both were members of the progressive Petrashevsky Circle, sentenced to the capital punishment as conspirators and both were pardoned later. Vasili Golovinski died in 1875 and Matvei Golovinski was reared by his mother and the French nanny. While studying jurisprudence, Golovinski joined an antisemitic counter- revolutionary group Holy Brotherhood (\\"Святое Братство\\"). Upon graduation, he worked for the Okhrana, secretly arranging pro-government coverage in the press. Golovinski's career almost collapsed and he had to leave the country after his activities were publicly exposed by Maxim Gorky. In France, he wrote and published articles on assignments of the Chief of Russian secret service in Paris, Pyotr Rachkovsky. After the October Revolution of 1917, Golovinsky switched sides and worked for the Bolsheviks until his death in 1920. Authorship of the Protocols On November 19, 1999, Patrick Bishop reported from Paris: > Research by a leading Russian historian, Mikhail Lepekhine, in recently > opened archives has found the forgery to be the work of Mathieu Golovinski, > opportunistic scion of an aristocratic but rebellious family that drifted > into a life of espionage and propaganda work. After working for the czarist > secret service, he later changed sides and joined the Bolsheviks. Mr. > Lepekhine’s findings, published in the French magazine L'Express, would > appear to clear up the last remaining mystery surrounding the Protocols. In his 2001 book The Question of the Authorship of \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\", a Ukrainian scholar Vadim Skuratovsky offers a scrupulous and extensive literary, historical and linguistic analysis of the original Russian language text of the Protocols. Skuratovsky provides evidence that Charles Joly, a son of Maurice Joly (on whose writings the Protocols are based), visited Saint Petersburg in 1902 and that Golovinsky and Charles Joly worked together at Le Figaro in Paris. Skuratovsky also traces the influences of Dostoyevsky's prose (in particular, The Grand Inquisitor and The Possessed) on Golovinsky's writings, including The Protocols. In his book The Non-Existent Manuscript. A Study of the Protocols of the Sages of Zion, Italian researcher Cesare De Michelis writesВадим Скуратовский Протоколы Доктор Фауст 1 that the hypothesis of Golovinski's authorship was based on a statement by Princess Catherine Radziwill, who claimed that she had seen a manuscript of the Protocols written by Golovinsky, Rachkovsky and Manusevich in 1905, but in 1905 Golovinsky and Rachkovsky had already left Paris and moved to Saint- Petersburg. Princess Radziwill was known to be an unreliable source. Also, the protocols had been mentioned already in the press in 1902. Golovinski had been linked to the work before; the German writer Konrad Heiden identified him as an author of the Protocols in 1944.Forging Protocols by Charles Paul Freund.

The coalition ran the I Count campaign in 2006–07 and organised The Wave, a campaign focused on the climatic impacts of energy production which took place on 5 December 2009, in the run up to the UN talks in Copenhagen. The coalition encourages individuals to lobby the government of the United Kingdom for what they see as positive policies on climate change. From 2005 to 2010 the director of the coalition was Ashok Sinha. There is also a Scottish secretariat called Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. The I Count Campaign The I Count campaign aimed to ensure that world leaders act on rising global greenhouse gas emissions in order to keep average global temperature increase to under 2 °C (3.6 °F) and so avoiding the more serious consequences of global warming. In 2006, the campaign focused on the lead up to the Queen's speech, urging the Government to introduce a Climate Change Bill in the forthcoming Parliamentary session, including legally binding cuts in emissions (3% per year and 50% by 2050), and an annual carbon budget. The I Count London Climate Change Rally was a demonstration in London on November 4, 2006. It was attended by 20,000 to 25,000 people and was timed to coincide with the release of the Stern Report, calling on the government to take more serious action to prevent damage from climate change. The event started with an initial rally at Grosvenor Square, outside the US Embassy, where George Monbiot, Caroline Lucas, and Norman Baker addressed the crowd. The rally marched to Trafalgar Square, joining with an already assembled crowd. The campaign then focussed on the contents of the Climate Change Bill and criticised the initial proposals as failing to take into account the 2 °C 'global warming danger threshold'. The Energy Campaign At the end of 2008, with the climate change act through parliament, the coalition switched its attention to energy policy. The new campaign demands were for the government to boost investment in renewables and scrap plans for a string of coal power stations beginning with Kingsnorth. Via a pair of e actions on their website, thousands of emails were sent to Ed Miliband, Gordon Brown and campaigners' local MPs requesting energy policy is rethought. The coalition are also working with The Age of Stupid team on their Not Stupid campaign. The Wave On 5 December 2009, people from all walks of life gathered in London and Glasgow to mark the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009 which took place in Copenhagen. The aim was to rally the British Government and other members of other parties in the United Kingdom to ‘Quit Dirty Coal’, ‘Protect the Poorest’ and ‘Act Fair & Fast’ to avoid the worst impacts of Climate Change. Reports of attendance vary from 40,000 to 60,000 people, which makes it the largest demonstration on climate change in the world to date.

The name indicates a yet earlier bridge at this location. The bridge took the London-Holyhead road (the modern-day Meadow View) over the river Smestow and later, the Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal.

History In the early 19th century the London-Holyhead road was realigned to cross the valley on an embankment over the Staffordshire and Worcestershire canal of 1771 and the river Smestow, which run through the suburb in a SW-NE direction. The 19th-century canal bridge had to be replaced by a more modern structure, capable of carrying increased traffic, built by Wolverhampton's County Borough council in the 1930s.

Later he was known for his reformulation of baking powder, his interest in Viking settlements in North America, and the monuments he built to Leif Erikson. Life and career Eben was born in Moscow, New York, located in the Genesee River valley, to Jerediah Horsford and Maria Charity Norton. \\"At home he showed a certain inventive or mechanical skill, great ability in sketching, and unbounded interest in collecting specimens from the rich fossil deposits on the family farm.\\" In 1837 Eben met James Hall working on the New York State Natural History Survey. Eben was of such service that Hall wrote Amos Eaton, effectively recommending him for scholarship. He instructed in perspective drawing at the school in Troy, New York, county seat of Rensselaer County. In 1838 Horsford was awarded Bachelor of Natural Science in Engineering from Rensselaer School and took up teaching mathematics and natural history at Albany Female Academy. At some point he met Mary L'Homedieux Gardiner of Shelter Island, Long Island, and she became the object of his affection, but her father found Eben unsuited. Seeking advancement, Horsford twice, for six-weeks, taught chemistry at Newark College (Newark, Delaware). In 1842 he attended an event of the American Association of Geologists and Naturalists, and thereafter took up a study of Justus von Liebig's Organic Chemistry. Soon he was advocating Liebig's views on agricultural chemistry. He decided to study with Liebig at the University of Giessen in Germany, and departed October 10, 1844. After he qualified to work in Liebig's lab in October 1845, he took up the analysis of nitrogen content of grains, an index of their nutritive value as fodder. In February of the following year he began quantitative elemental analysis of \\"sugar of gelatin\\", then called glycocoll. Previous attempts at this analysis by Mulder and Bossingault had yielded unwieldy giants; Horsford's result was C4H5NO3 , not exactly right. Henry Darwin Rogers had been the leading candidate for the Rumford Chair of Physics until John White Webster got involved. Rogers had been tarnished by association with Vestiges of Creation, and as recommended by Webster, Horsford in Germany visited laboratories and industrial plants before returning from Liebig's lab. Since Rogers and George B. Emerson had charged Webster with incompetence, and challenged his Harvard position, Webster was keen that Horsford take the Rumford Chair rather than Rogers. On January 30, 1847, Horsford was elected unanimously by Harvard Corporation The new university president was Edward Everett, and Abbott Lawrence had come forward to finance a new scientific school at Harvard. But the funds for Horsford’s lab were consumed by heating costs and salaries for a janitor and assistants. In April of 1854 Horsford realized that the demands put upon him were unreasonably onerous and he wrote the Corporation: \\"The necessity of the elementary instruction made it my fortune to be oppressed pecuniarily and professionally. In attempting to do what seemed to be required, I was compelled almost to lose sight of the objects which as a scientific man I had placed before myself.\\" Horsford taught chemistry and conducted research at the Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard for 16 years. For textbooks, the same ones that were used in Germany were also followed at Harvard (and Yale): Heinrich Will's Outlines of the course of Qualitative Analysis followed in the Giessen Laboratory (1847)Henry Will (1847) Outlines of the course of qualitative analysis followed in the Giessen laboratory via Internet Archive , and Remigius Fresenius's Instruction in Chemical Analysis (quantitative) (1846).C. Remigius Fresenius (1846) Instruction in Chemical Analysis (quantitative) via Internet Archive His publication included such topics as phosphates, condensed milk, fermentation, and emergency rations. Anne Whitney, Eben Norton Horsford, 1890, Davis Museum, Wellesley College A generous supporter of higher education for women, Horsford became president of the board of visitors of Wellesley College, and donated money for books, scientific apparatus, and a pension fund to the college. He enjoyed remarkable success through his development of processes for manufacturing baking powder and condensed milk. In seeking patents for his inventions, Horsford was assisted by Charles Grafton Page, a patent solicitor who had previously worked at the US Patent Office. Professor Eben Norton Horsford created the Shelter Island Public Library in Shelter Island, New York in 1885. He donated 280 volumes for the first library, which was initially housed in a closet in the Old Store, a building that functioned as a post office, telegraph station, and local meeting place. After the store burned down in 1891, a new library for more books donated by Professor Horsford was built on a nearby lot donated by his daughter Lilian, and his daughter Cornelia became the library's first president. =Baking powder= Manufactory of Rumford baking powder, ca.1910 Baking powder had contained baking soda and cream of tartar. Horsford replaced the cream of tartar with the more reliable calcium biphosphate (also known as calcium acid phosphate and many other names). He did this a little earlier than August Oetker. In 1854, Horsford, with partner George Wilson, formed the Rumford Chemical Works. They named it after the title of Horsford's position at Harvard. Horsford obtained patents for the production of calcium biphosphate as well as other chemicals. The creation of a commercially successful baking powder was the basis of his wealth, enabling him to pursue personal and philanthropic interests in later life. Horsford's development of baking powder was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark in 2006.

He connected the Charles River Basin to places described in the Norse sagas, invented Old Norse etymologies for Algonquian place-names like Naumkeag, Namskaket, and Amoskeag, and 'discovered' Viking archaeological remains. Horsford had a plaque documenting all this placed on Memorial Drive near Mount Auburn Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. A few miles upstream, at the mouth of Stony Brook, he had Norumbega Tower built marking the supposed location of Norumbega, a Viking fort and city, complete with its Althing and America's first Christian bishop. He also commissioned a statue of Leif Ericson that stands on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston. The professor wrote a series of books, articles, and pamphlets about the Vikings' visits to Massachusetts. After his death, his daughter Cornelia Horsford took up the cause. Their work received little support from mainstream historians and archeologists at the time, and even less today.Steven Williams, Fantastic Archaeology: The Wild Side of North American Prehistory, 1991.Gloria Polizzotti Greis . Needham Historical Society In honor of Horsford's generous donations to Wellesley College, a building named Norumbega Hall was dedicated in 1886 and celebrated by a poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.

The tradition is continued in modern Russia and some other former Soviet Republics. Subbotniks are mostly organized for cleaning the streets of garbage, fixing public amenities, collecting recyclable material, and other community services. The first mass subbotnik was held on April 12, 1919, at the Moscow-Sortirovochnaya railway depot of the Moscow-Kazan Railway upon the initiative of local Bolsheviks. It was stated in the Resolution of the General Council of Communists of the Subraion of the Moscow-Kazan Railway and Their Adherents that \\"the communists and their supporters again must spur themselves on and extract from their time off still another hour of work, i.e. they must increase their working day by an hour, add it up and on Saturday devote six hours at a stretch to physical labour, thereby producing immediately a real value. Considering that communists should not spare their health and lives for the victory of the revolution, the work is conducted without pay.\\"Kaplan (1968) p.359 This subbotnik prompted Lenin to write the article ', where he called subbotniks \\"the actual beginnings of the communism\\". The first all- Russian subbotnik was held on May 1, 1920, and Vladimir Lenin participated in removing building rubble in the Moscow Kremlin, an episode portrayed in a famous painting by Vladimir Krikhatsky, Lenin at the First Subbotnik, of Lenin carrying a log. Subsequently, \\"communist subbotniks\\" and \\"voskresniks\\" became obligatory political events in the Soviet Union, with annual \\"Lenin's Subbotnik\\" being held in the vicinity of Lenin's birthday. Subbotnik was also promoted in the 1950s in the Eastern Bloc countries and in particular in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), as the USSR sought to build up the GDR as the westernmost outpost of socialism in Europe.

In 2006, he ran for a seat in the United States Senate, losing to incumbent Jon Kyl. Life and career Pederson was born and raised in Casa Grande, Arizona, the oldest of six brothers. Pederson's father, Ed Pederson, was the City Manager of Casa Grande for 25 years, and his mother, Lillian Pederson, was a registered nurse who stayed home to raise her sons. After high school in Casa Grande, Pederson went to the University of Arizona where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a master's in public administration. After college, Pederson took a job with the Research and Budget Division for the city of Phoenix, and later worked as administrative assistant to Phoenix Mayor Milt Graham. When Graham left office, Pederson entered the commercial-development business working for Grossman Company Properties and Westcor and eventually formed The Pederson Group with his brother Gary. The Pederson Group has since developed over 25 retail projects across Arizona. Pederson has been married to Roberta Pederson for 33 years. They have 3 children and 4 grandchildren. Chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party In 2001, Pederson was elected chairman of the Arizona Democratic Party, which was then in need of funds and new infrastructure. Pederson was able to bring both. He is credited with recruiting two top-notch candidates for statewide office 2002: then-Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano for Governor and former Phoenix mayor and gubernatorial candidate Terry Goddard for Attorney General.

Pederson faced Jon Kyl, an incumbent who ran for a third term in the Senate. Early head-to-head polls showed Kyl significantly ahead of Pederson. In addition, a poll released on September 19, 2006 by SurveyUSA indicated that Kyl was still in the lead, although by a narrower margin: Kyl led Pederson by 48% to 43% with 7% undecided. The race was one of the most expensive in Arizona history. As of May 7, Kyl's campaign had raised over $9 million primarily from private donations and large fundraising dinners. Pederson's campaign raised over $5 million primarily through a dinner event with former U.S. President Bill Clinton and a $2 million donation from Pederson himself. In the general election on November 7, 2006, Pederson attained 44% of the popular vote (506,759 votes) compared to 53% of the vote for winner Jon Kyl.

Morton Salt facility in Chicago, Illinois Salt mounds at Morton Salt in Newark, California History The company began in Chicago, Illinois, in 1848 as a small sales agency, E. I. Wheeler, started by the Onondaga salt companies to sell their salt to the Midwest. In 1910, the business, which had by that time become both a manufacturer and a merchant of salt, was incorporated as the Morton Salt Company. It was named after the owner and founder, Joy Morton, the son of J. Sterling Morton who founded Arbor Day. Joy Morton started working for E. I. Wheeler in 1880, buying into the company for $10,000, with which he bought a fleet of lake boats to move salt west.Kurlansky, Mark. (2002)Salt: A world history. New York: Penguin Books In 1969, the name 'Morton-Norwich' came into use. In 1896, Alfred Bevis founded the Bevis Rock Salt Company, building on the failed Lyons salt company he had previously invested in and run. His daughter, Florence, married Dr. Charles Howard Longsterth, whom Bevis brought into both the Lyons and Bevis salt companies as an executive. Their son, Bevis Longstreth, became president and general manager on his return from service in World War I. In 1919, Morton Salt acquired Bevis. About ten years later, Bevis Longstreth founded Thiokol Corporation, which merged with Morton Salt in 1982 to form Morton-Thiokol. This merger was divested in 1989, following the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which was blamed on Morton-Thiokol products. Morton received the company's consumer chemical products divisions, while Thiokol retained only the space propulsion systems concern. In 1999, Morton Salt was acquired by the Philadelphia-based Rohm and Haas Company, Inc. and operated as a division of that company along with the Canadian Salt Company (which Morton had acquired in 1954). On April 2, 2009, it was reported that Morton Salt was being acquired by German fertilizer and salt company K+S for a total enterprise value of US$1.7 billion.K+S acquires Morton Salt – Transaction creates global leader in salt, Press Release, April 2, 2009. The sale, completed by October 2009, was in conjunction with the Dow Chemical Company's takeover of Rohm and Haas. Facilities and logo The Morton Salt Company's current headquarters office is in the River Point building at 444 West Lake Street in Chicago, becoming its first tenant in December 2016. Its previous headquarters was at 123 North Wacker Drive. Prior to its acquisition in 1999, the firm's corporate headquarters was at 100 North Riverside Plaza (later the headquarters of Boeing) and before that at 110 North Wacker Drive and 208 West Washington Street Morton operates a research & development laboratory in Elgin, Illinois, and produces salt at eight vacuum evaporation plants, six underground mines, five solar evaporation plants, and five packaging facilities across the United States, Canada, and The Bahamas. Acquired in 1954, the company owns the second-largest solar saline operation in North America, in Matthew Town, Inagua, The Bahamas. Morton Salt's logo features the \\"Morton Salt Girl,\\" a young girl walking in the rain with an opened umbrella and scattering salt behind her from a cylindrical container of table salt, and is one of the ten best-known symbols in the United States. The company's logo and its motto, \\"When it rains, it pours\\", both originating in a 1914 advertising campaign, were developed to illustrate the point that Morton Salt was free flowing even in rainy weather. The company began adding magnesium carbonate as an absorbing agent to its table salt in 1911 to ensure that it poured freely. However, around 1958, the company realized that their salt was not living up to their slogan. A chemist, Richard A. Patton, was given the assignment to solve this problem. He invented a machine that would coat the salt with a byproduct of salt mining, magnesium oxide. Calcium silicate is now used instead for the same purpose. The same chemist developed a total of 27 patents, along with fellow chemists, that expanded Morton's commercialization of magnesium oxide. The Morton Salt Girl, also known as the Umbrella Girl, has gone through seven different iterations, including the latest update in 2014 for its \\"hundredth birthday\\", with other updates being in 1921, 1933, 1941, 1956, and 1968;Morton Salt logo history. the company sells associated memorabiliaMorton Salt on line store. and makes some of its vintage advertisements freely available.Gallery of Morton Salt advertisements. In addition to the Morton Salt Girl being updated, its centennial in 2014 was celebrated with 100 parties in 100 cities, Morton Salt Girl Centennial Scholarships to benefit certain fine arts and culinary arts students at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Kendall College School of Culinary Arts, Morton Salt Girl day at Wrigley Field, Facebook and Instagram lookalike contests, and other activities. Also in 2014, the Morton Salt Girl was voted into the Advertising Week Walk of Fame on Madison Avenue in New York City; it is the first girl icon to be inducted.

On 28 November 2012, the council announced that Finchfield library along with a few others, would remain open where they are. Facilities Westacre Infant school and Uplands Junior school are situated in this area. There are also two public houses, \\"The Chestnut Tree\\" and \\"Westacres\\". In the centre of Finchfield is a Lidl supermarket, which has been the subject of a public inquiry after it appealed refusal of planning permission when applying to extend the store. The planned extension would result in the demolition of a Victorian era property, which residents and the City Council have appealed against, though the Planning Inspectorate have now granted permission for the extension to go ahead. Crime and local reaction There have been several recent criminal incidents around the shopping parade at Finchfield Road West, notably an armed robbery at the Co-Op store in September 2012. In response, residents, with the backing of West Midlands Police, have set up a 'Shop Watch' for recording incidents of anti-social behaviour, graffiti and fly tipping.

It is largely used by commuters entering Manchester from surrounding suburbs and cities, but is also one of the main railway lines in the North West and is utilised by TransPennine Express regional services and to Scotland. It was announced in December 2009 that the line would be electrified, following an announcement in July 2009 that the Chat Moss line between Manchester and Liverpool was to be electrified first. The electrification work for this line commenced in May 2015 and was due for completion in May 2018, but was delayed until December 2018. Electric service commenced on 11 February 2019. The line is one of the busiest in the North West, with seven trains per hour in each direction during the off-peak daytime timetable. The line speed is currently 100 mph.  History  The line was opened as far as Bolton in 1838 by the Manchester and Bolton Railway, then extended in 1841 by the Bolton and Preston Railway. These were amalgamated, via the East Lancashire Railway, as part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. Route The route now has 2 starting points in Manchester: * Manchester Piccadilly, which offers rail links to most large cities in the country. Trains using the route will call at the through platforms 13 and 14 on the west side of the station. It then follows the route of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway as far as , where it uses the Windsor link to reach and joins the line from Manchester Victoria. * Manchester Victoria was the original starting point before the Windsor Link was created. It goes through Salford Central, after which it then joins the line from the Windsor Link and enters Salford Crescent. The route then continues to Clifton, and then passes through Kearsley, Farnworth and Moses Gate following the Irwell Valley for much of the route. The first major town is Bolton. Just after Bolton station there is a junction to the right where the Ribble Valley line, a single track line, heads off to Blackburn and Clitheroe. The line cuts through the western suburbs of Bolton including Lostock, where trains to Wigan Wallgate via Westhoughton, branch off. Next is Horwich Parkway opened in 1999 and Blackrod (where the former Horwich Branch diverged). It then proceeds through the town of Adlington and on to Chorley, passing through , which opened in 2011 and finally joins the West Coast Main Line at Euxton Junction before continuing via Leyland to Preston. Operators Northern operate all timetabled services over the full length of the line since the start of the new Northern and Trans-Pennine Express franchises in April 2016. These include limited stop workings from and via Manchester Piccadilly to , a limited number of Manchester Airport to and trains and stopping trains from Manchester Victoria to Blackpool North. Some of the latter run to or from . Other workings use part of the line only - e.g. Manchester Victoria to and via (which diverge at ), Manchester Airport to Southport/Manchester Victoria to Wigan Wallgate via (diverge at Lostock Junction) and Manchester Victoria to and (diverge at Bolton). TransPennine Express used to operate the semi-fast Blackpool & Barrow/Windermere prior to the aforementioned 2016 changes - they now only operate the through trains to Glasgow Central and Edinburgh, which currently run via and Chat Moss rather than via this route (though will change when electrification work is completed in early 2019). Virgin Pendolino trains will be using the line as the Bolton Corridor route in 2019. This will connect the Bolton Interchange to the main Scotland to London route via Manchester Piccadilly. Other TOCs operate along the southern section of the route to Ordsall Lane Jn and go on to Warrington: * Transport for Wales operate services en route to Llandudno via and . * East Midlands Railway also operate services between Norwich and Liverpool Lime Street Freight and diversions The line is an important diversionary route at weekends, used in conjunction with the Crewe–Manchester line to divert away from a large section of the West Coast Main Line if required. The convenience is that this only adds 35–40 minutes to a journey and negates the need for costly bus replacement services. Some freight still uses this line (such as stone trains from the Peak District to a distribution terminal at Hope St., Salford and \\"Bin-liner\\" refuse trains from Pendleton to Scunthorpe), especially during the peak periods during the day. It is, however, a primary passenger route in the North West of England. Trains Class 185 trains were the most frequent units on the line: working for First TransPennine Express to , and . In the other direction, they all worked to although engineering works resulted in some services working to instead. Prior to 2007, Class 175 trains worked the majority of these services before the 185s took over. Between May 2001 and December 2006, they worked all and services and the majority of the services. However, they never worked to Scotland due to this being a Virgin CrossCountry service until December 2007. TransPennine Express use mainly newer Class 397 Civitys on the line having replaced the older Class 350 units. Class 185 still appear occasionally when the Class 397 Civity units are unavailable. Northern Trains operate a variety of rolling stock for their services, with Class 331s, Class 323s and Class 319. Northern also use Class 195s, Class 158s, Class 156s, Class 153s, Class 150s and Class 142s on the line. Most of the diesel services only use the line south of as these diverge onto the unelectrified lines, notably the Ribble Valley line to and and the Manchester–Southport line to . Since December 2019, services between / and have been run using Class 331 units. Some Sunday services between and also use Class 331 units. Electrification Work on 25 kV OHL electrification of the line began in May 2015 and has included numerous bridgeworks plus the major undertaking of the re-boring of Farnworth Tunnel. Its high profile resulted in a visit from Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, shortly after work started, and from Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin in August 2015 during the reboring work. Breakthrough was achieved in late, rather than early October, due to loose sand delaying the work in August; the first trains running through the new twin track bore on Monday 14 December 2015. Electrification of the line was due for completion by December 2016, then delayed until December 2017 and then further delayed until May 2018. In January 2018 yet another delay was announced. This was attributed to difficult ground conditions including hard rock and running sand resulting from old mine workings. Test trains (Virgin Pendolino) finally ran between Preston and Manchester in December 2018. The first scheduled passenger- carrying electric services began on 11 February 2019, running to Blackpool North, Buckshaw Parkway, Manchester Victoria and Manchester Airport using Class 319 EMUs.

Manitoba Historical Society. Accessed November 27, 2011. was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as the 13th Mayor of Winnipeg, and was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1900 to 1914. Taylor was a member of the Conservative Party. Taylor was born in Portsmouth, England, and was educated in London, Ontario. He came to Winnipeg in 1877 and set up a bookbinding business two years letter. Taylor served as a Winnipeg alderman in 1892, was elected mayor 1893, and was re-elected without opposition in 1894. He was also the president of the Manitoba Rifle Association, and of the St. Andrew's Society. In religion, he was a member of the Church of England. Taylor first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1896 provincial election, and lost to Liberal Peter McIntyre by 238 votes in Winnipeg North. He was first elected to the legislature in a by-election, held for Winnipeg Centre on November 1, 1900. Taylor defeated Liberal candidate Robert Muir by 157 votes, and served in the legislature as a backbench supporter of Rodmond Roblin's administration. He was re-elected in the riding of Winnipeg Centre over the Liberal candidate, J.A. McArthur, in the elections of 1903 and 1907. He was returned to the legislature again in the 1910 election, under controversial circumstances. Taylor defeated Fred Dixon, a Labour candidate supported by the Liberal Party, by a margin of seventy-three votes. The Socialist Party also ran a candidate in Winnipeg Centre, who received ninety-nine votes. Some believe the Conservatives encouraged the Socialist campaign to ensure their own victory. Despite his municipal experience, Taylor was never appointed to cabinet. He did not seek re-election in 1914, and died ten years later. Taylor's son-in-law, W.C. Birt, took over the family's bookbinding business after Taylor's death. The Thomas William Taylor printing plant and book bindery remained open in Winnipeg until 1968.

It is a practical unit, and is not dimensionally homogeneous, and so is only used in this one field. It is named after American physicist Irving Langmuir.  Definition  The langmuir is defined by multiplying the pressure of the gas by the time of exposure. One langmuir corresponds to an exposure of 10−6 Torr during one second. For example, exposing a surface to a gas pressure of 10−8 Torr for 100 seconds corresponds to 1 L. Similarly, keeping the pressure of oxygen gas at 2.5·10−6 Torr for 40 seconds will give a dose of 100 L.  Derivation  Exposure of a surface in surface physics is a type of fluence, that is the integral of number flux (JN) with respect to exposed time (t) to give a number of particles per unit area (Φ): :\\\\Phi = \\\\int{J_N} \\\\, {\\\\rm d}t. The number flux for an ideal gas, that is the number of gas molecules passing through (in a single direction) a surface of unit area in unit time, can be derived from kinetic theory: :J_N = \\\\frac{C\\\\bar u}{4}, where C is the number density of the gas, and \\\\bar u is the mean speed of the molecules (not the root-mean-square speed, although the two are related). The number density of an ideal gas depends the thermodynamic temperature (T) and the pressure (p): :C = \\\\frac{N}{V} = \\\\frac{p}{kT}. The mean speed of the gas molecules can also be derived from kinetic theory:http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/kmt3dpdf/kmt3dpdf.html :\\\\bar u = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{8kT}{\\\\pi m}}, where m is the mass of a gas molecule. Hence :J_N = \\\\frac{C\\\\bar u}{4} = p\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi kTm}}. The proportionality between number flux and pressure is only strictly valid for a given temperature and a given molecular mass of adsorbing gas. However, the dependence is only on the square roots of m and T. Gas adsorption experiments typically operate around ambient temperature with light gases, and so the langmuir remains useful as a practical unit.  Usage  Assuming that every gas molecule hitting the surface sticks to it (that is, the sticking coefficient is 1), one langmuir (1 L) leads to a coverage of about one monolayer of the adsorbed gas molecules on the surface. In general, the sticking coefficient varies depending on the reactivity of the surface and the molecules, so that the langmuir gives a lower limit of the time it needs to completely cover a surface. This also illustrates why ultra-high vacuum (UHV) must be used to study solid-state surfaces, nanostructures or even single molecules. The typical time to perform physical experiments on sample surfaces is in the range of one to several hours. In order to keep the surface free of contaminations, the pressure of the residual gas in a UHV chamber should be below 10−10 Torr. References *.

It neighbors the villages of Diraz and Bani Jamra. History The town was founded by the Dawasiri tribe, but most of the tribe left en masse to mainland Saudi Arabia in 1923, after conflict emerged with the British colonial authorities. Many Dawasir tribe members later returned to Budaiya, with some still living in the village today. Prior to the discovery of oil in Bahrain, most Budaiya residents were involved in the pearl diving and fishing industry. According to the Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia in 1917, Budaiya village was made up of three distinct quarters; Fariq-al Amarah, Fariq-al Dam (located on Ras-Budaiya) and Fariq-al Budaiya (the oldest quarter). The town had considerable numbers of stone houses and reed huts. The estimated population was 8,000 and were thought to be all adherents of Sunni Islam; 800 houses belonged to the Dawasir tribe, 100 to the Amarah tribe, 50 to the Huwala, 200 to \\"free negroes\\" and around 450 houses for black slaves. The port was home to more than 100 boats, over half of which were utilised for pearling. There were also 3 Qur'anic schools in the town.

It is now the location of most farms, stables, and traditional gulf family farms/retreats nakhal. The town serves as one end-point of the Budaiya Road, which runs to Manama. The regions on either side of road are colloquially referred to as Budaiya. The biggest problem the Budaiya Road region is facing is deforestation due to a waves of construction, and the seeping of sea water into natural underground aquifers as a result of the pre-construction building process of the Mina Salman seaport in the 1950s. Budaiya Road is still remembered as one of the only \\"naturally shaded\\" parts of Bahrain where thousands of wild palm trees acted as filters from the hot, glaring desert sun.

It is structurally related to coumarin by the addition of a fused furan ring, and may be considered as a derivative of umbelliferone. Psoralen occurs naturally in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, as well as in the common fig, celery, parsley, West Indian satinwood, and in all citrus fruits. It is widely used in PUVA (psoralen + UVA) treatment for psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma; these applications are typically through the use of medications such as Methoxsalen. Many furanocoumarins are extremely toxic to fish, and some are deposited in streams in Indonesia to catch fish. Uses Psoralen is a mutagen, and is used for this purpose in molecular biology research. Psoralen intercalates into DNA and on exposure to ultraviolet (UVA) radiation can form monoadducts and covalent interstrand cross-links (ICL) with thymines, preferentially at 5'-TpA sites in the genome, inducing apoptosis. Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) therapy can be used to treat hyperproliferative skin disorders like psoriasis and certain kinds of skin cancer. Unfortunately, PUVA treatment itself leads to a higher risk of skin cancer. An important use of psoralen is in PUVA treatment for skin problems such as psoriasis and, to a lesser extent, eczema and vitiligo. This takes advantage of the high UV absorbance of psoralen. The psoralen is applied first to sensitise the skin, then UVA light is applied to clean up the skin problem. Psoralen has also been recommended for treating alopecia. Psoralens are also used in photopheresis, where they are mixed with the extracted leukocytes before UV radiation is applied. Despite the photocarcinogenic properties of psoralen, it was used as a tanning activator in sunscreens until 1996. Psoralens are used in tanning accelerators, because psoralen increases the skin's sensitivity to light. Some patients have had severe skin loss after sunbathing with psoralen-containing tanning activators. Patients with lighter skin colour suffer four times as much from the melanoma-generating properties of psoralens than those with darker skin. Psoralens short term side effects include nausea, vomiting, erythrema, pruritus, xerosis, skin pain due to phototoxic damage of dermal nerve and may cause cutaneous and genital skin malignancies. An additional use for optimized psoralens is for the inactivation of pathogens in blood products. The synthetic amino-psoralen, amotosalen HCl, has been developed for the inactivation of infectious pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa) in platelet and plasma blood components prepared for transfusion support of patients. Prior to clinical use, amotosalen-treated platelets have been tested and found to be non-carcinogenic when using the established p53 knockout mouse model.Ciaravino V, McCullough T, Dayan AD: Pharmacokinetic and toxicology assessment of INTERCEPT (S-59 and UVA treated)platelets. Human Exp Toxicol 2001;20:533–550 The technology is currently in routine use in certain European blood centers and has been recently approved in the US.https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm427111.htmhttps://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm427500.htm Chemistry Psoralen intercalates into the DNA double helix where it is ideally positioned to form one or more adducts with adjacent pyrimidine bases, preferentially thymine, upon excitation by an ultraviolet photon. Several physicochemical methods have been employed to derive binding constants for psoralen-DNA interactions. Classically, two chambers of psoralen and buffered DNA solution are partitioned by a semi-permeable membrane; the affinity of the psoralen for DNA is directly related to the concentration of the psoralen in the DNA chamber after equilibrium. Water solubility is important for two reasons: pharmacokinetics relating to drug solubility in blood and necessitating the use of organic solvents (e.g. DMSO). Psoralens can also be activated by irradiation with long wavelength UV light. While UVA range light is the clinical standard, research that UVB is more efficient at forming photoadducts suggests that its use may lead to higher efficacy and lower treatment times. The photochemically reactive sites in psoralens are the alkene-like carbon-carbon double bonds in the furan ring (the five-member ring) and the pyrone ring (the six-member ring). When appropriately intercalated adjacent to a pyrimidine base, a four-center photocycloaddition reaction can lead to the formation of either of two cyclobutyl-type monoadducts. Ordinarily, furan-side monoadducts form in a higher proportion. The furan monoadduct can absorb a second UVA photon leading to a second four- center photocycloaddition at the pyrone end of the molecule and hence the formation of a diadduct or cross-link. Pyrone monoadducts do not absorb in the UVA range and hence cannot form cross-links with further UVA irradiation. Another important feature of this class of compounds is their ability to generate singlet oxygen, although this process is in direct competition with adduct formation and may be an alternate pathway for the dissipation of excited state energy. Research on psoralen has historically focused on interactions with DNA and RNA (in particular, ICL formation). Psoralen, however, has also been shown to block signaling of the ErbB2 receptor which is overexpressed in certain aggressive types of breast cancer. A synthetic derivative of bergapten, 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy)psoralen, shows promise as an immunosuppressant by inhibiting a specific potassium channel. Its structure prevents intercalation into DNA, and it only very weakly produces singlet oxygen, majorly reducing unwanted toxicity and mutagenicity in vivo. This has implications for the treatment of various autoimmune diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis, type-1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis). While cell-surface modification and ion channel blocking are two newly discovered mechanisms of action, much research remains to be done. =Structure= Most furanocoumarins can be regarded as derivatives of either psoralen or angelicin. Psoralen and its derivatives are often referred to as the linear furanocoumarins, so called since they exhibit a linear chemical structure. Important linear furanocoumarins include xanthotoxin (also called methoxsalen), bergapten, imperatorin, and nodakenetin. Structures of angelicin, xanthotoxin, bergapten and nodekenetin The structure of psoralen was originally deduced by identifying the products of its degradation reactions. It exhibits the normal reactions of the lactone of coumarin, such as ring opening by alkali to give a coumarinic acid or coumaric acid derivative. Potassium permanganate causes oxidation of the furan ring, while other methods of oxidation produce furan-2,3-carboxylic acid. =Synthesis= Psoralen is difficult to synthesize because umbelliferone undergoes substitution at the 8-position rather than at the desired 6 position. Benzofuran reacts preferentially in the furan ring rather than in the benzene ring. However, the 7-hydroxy derivative of 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (also called coumaran) does undergo substitution at the desired 6-position allowing the following synthesis of the coumarin system via a Gattermann-Koch reaction followed by a Perkin condensation using acetic anhydride. The synthesis is then completed by dehydrogenation of the five- membered ring to produce the furan ring. Synthesis of psoralen from 6-hydroxycoumaran Biosynthesis Psoralen originates from coumarins in the shikimate pathway; its biosynthesis is shown in the figure below. The aromatic ring in 6 is activated at positions ortho to the hydroxyl group, and is alkylated by 5, an alkylating agent. The dimethylallyl group in 7 then undergoes cyclization with the phenol group to give 8. This transformation is catalysed by a cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase17 (psoralen 5-monooxygenase), and cofactors (NADPH) and molecular oxygen. A biosynthetic pathway in which psoralen is formed is shown in the figure below. A second P-450-dependent monooxygenase enzyme (psoralen synthase) then cleaves off 10 (in the form of 11) from 8 to give 1. This pathway does not involve any hydroxylated intermediate, and cleavage is postulated to be initiated by a radical reaction. Synthesis of psoralen from 6-hydroxycoumaran  Plant sources  Ficus carica (fig) is probably the most abundant source of psoralens. They are also found in small quantities in Ammi visnaga (bisnaga), Pastinaca sativa (parsnip), Petroselinum crispum (parsley), Levisticum officinale (lovage), Foeniculum vulgare (fruit, i.e., fennel seeds), Daucus carota (carrot), Psoralea corylifolia (babchi), Apium graveolens (celery), bergamot oil (bergapten, bergamottin). Repair of psoralen DNA adducts PUVA treatment produces both DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and monoadducts. The ICLs introduced by psoralen are highly genotoxic to actively replicating cells. The covalent linkage impedes replication fork progression. Thus unlinking the ICL is required before replication can resume. The initial steps in repair ordinarily involve incisions in one parental strand on both sides of the crosslink. Subsequently, repair of the lesion can occur by an accurate or an inaccurate process. The accurate process for repairing crosslinks is homologous recombinational repair (HRR). This involves replacing the damaged information using the intact information from another homologous chromosome in the same cell. Escherichia coli cells deficient in HRR are highly sensitive to PUVA compared to wild-type cells. HRR appears to be efficient. In E. coli, even though one or two unrepaired crosslinks are sufficient to inactivate a cell, a wild-type cell can repair and therefore recover from 53 to 71 psoralen crosslinks. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae HRR is a major pathway for accurately removing psoralen-crosslinks. In wild-type yeast, the recombination events associated with crosslink removal by HRR are predominantly non- crossover gene conversion events. Psoralen crosslinks in virus DNA also appear to be removed by a recombinational repair process as occurs in SV40 virus infected cells, and in herpes simplex virus infected cells. One inaccurate process for repairing psoralen crosslinks appears to employ a DNA polymerase to fill in the gap formed in the strand with the two incisions. This process is inaccurate because the complementary un-incised strand still retains a portion of the crosslink and thus cannot serve as an adequate template for accurate repair synthesis. Inaccurate repair synthesis can cause mutation. Psoralen monoadducts in the template DNA strand may also cause inaccurate replication bypass (translesion synthesis) that can lead to mutation. In phage T4, the increase in mutation observed after PUVA treatment was found to reflect translesion synthesis by wild-type DNA polymerase, likely due to imperfect proof reading capability.  Analysis of nucleic acids structures  Psoralens can reversibly crosslink nucleic acids double helices, and therefore have been used extensively for the analysis of interactions and structures for both DNA and RNA.

In mainstream economic theories, the labour supply is the total hours (adjusted for intensity of effort) that workers wish to work at a given real wage rate. It is frequently represented graphically by a labour supply curve, which shows hypothetical wage rates plotted vertically and the amount of labour that an individual or group of individuals is willing to supply at that wage rate plotted horizontally.  Neoclassical view  This backward bending supply curve of labour shows how the change in real wage rates affects the number of hours worked by employees. Labour supply curves derive from the 'labour-leisure' trade-off. More hours worked earn higher incomes, but necessitate a cut in the amount of leisure that workers enjoy. Consequently, there are two effects on the amount of labour supplied due to a change in the real wage rate. As, for example, the real wage rate rises, the opportunity cost of leisure increases. This tends to make workers supply more labour (the \\"substitution effect\\"). However, also as the real wage rate rises, workers earn a higher income for a given number of hours. If leisure is a normal good—the demand for it increases as income increases—this increase in income tends to make workers supply less labour so they can \\"spend\\" the higher income on leisure (the \\"income effect\\"). If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect then the labour supply slopes upward. If, beyond a certain wage rate, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, then the labour supply curve bends backward. Individual labor supply curves can be aggregated to derive the total labour supply of an economy.Ehrenberg and Smith, \\"Modern Labor Economics\\", HarperCollins, 2008  Marxist view  From a Marxist perspective, a labour supply is a core requirement in a capitalist society. To avoid labour shortage and ensure a labour supply, a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-provisioning, which would let them be independent—and they must instead, to survive, be compelled to sell their labour for a subsistence wage.Maurice Dobb (1947) Studies in the Development of Capitalism New York: International Publishers Co.

It consists of the unincorporated community of Adeytown, and had a population of 307 in the Canada 2006 Census. Adeytown (formerly called Lee Bight), like Deep Bight, Piston Mere, Maggoty Cove and Forrester's Point, was founded in the 1850s and 1860s as a small logging operation and, with the building of the Newfoundland Railway, it grew as the demand for lumber was at a peak. Geography Edward and Pasco Adey came to Lee Bight c.1865 from Hant's Harbour with the intention of logging. Lee Bight had all of the natural requirements for a logging operation, a nearby timber stand sufficient to support a water powered sawmill from a nearby fast flowing brook and clear access to the sea to ship the sawn lumber. History of Adeytown Around 1865, Edward, Israel, and Pasco Adey came to Lee Bight (later Adeytown), from Hants Harbour with the intention of logging. By 1870 a water powered sawmill had been built, one of several in the Northwest Arm in Trinity Bay at the time. The first (Methodist) school in Lee Bight was reported in 1883 with 16 students taught by a Miss Mary Mayo. Miss. Mayo had split her time at the Lee Bight School and the half at the Deep Bight school nearby. In the early 20th century Adeytown had closed its Methodist school and shared one with Caplin Cove. By 1911 Adeytown had 2 sawmills and a church along with the school shared with Caplin Cove and about 30 people were living there for the 1911 Census.

If there is no one taking a drink, then the one who said the particular \\"Never have I ever...\\" statement must take a drink. This rule often forces the players to strategize more and makes for less disposable/pointless suggestions. A further variation holds that whenever only one person is drinking, that person must give a detailed account of why they are drinking. Another variety of this game involves putting up five or ten fingers, putting one down whenever something mentioned has been done. Those who end up putting down all of their fingers must take several successive drinks.

He lived for a time in Berlin, Germany before moving to the Soviet Union following the Nazi rise to power in Germany. He was a victim of the post-war antisemitic \\"rootless cosmopolitan\\" campaign and one of those executed on the Night of the Murdered Poets. Biography Born in the shtetl of Okhrimovo (also known as Okhrymovka, and also as Sarny near Uman) in Kiev province, he first became known as a writer in the wake of the failed Russian Revolution of 1905. From a Hasidic background, but having received both religious and secular education, much of his writing is reminiscent of Anton Chekhov: stories of \\"largely secular, frustrated young people…, ineffectual intellectuals…\\", frustrated by the provincial shtetl life. Writing at first in Hebrew and Russian, he only met success when he turned to his native Yiddish; his first successful book was Arum Vokzal (At the Depot) a novella, published at his own expense in 1909 in Warsaw. In 1917, he founded the avant garde Jidishe Kultur Lige (Yiddish Culture League) in Kiev. In spring 1921 he moved to Berlin, which would be his base throughout the years of the Weimar Republic, although he traveled extensively through Europe and also visited the United States in 1929-30, to cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York. According to J. Hoberman, he was \\"the best-known (and certainly the best-paid) Russian Yiddish writer of the 1920s\\". Until the mid-1920s he wrote for the New York City-based Yiddish- language newspaper The Forward. His 1926 essay \\"Three Centers\\" expressed a belief that the Soviet Union (where Yiddish language and literature were then receiving official patronage) had eclipsed the assimilationist United States and backwards Poland as the great future locus of Yiddish literature. He began writing for the Communist Yiddish press in both New York (Morgen Freiheit) and Moscow (Emes), and moved to the Soviet Union in 1933, around the time the Nazis came to power in Germany. He was positively impressed with the Jewish Autonomous Republic of Birobidzhan, and participated in the Jewish Anti- Fascist Committee during World War II, co-editing the literary section of the Committee's journal, Eynikayt (Unity). However, like many Soviet Jewish writers, he became a target of the antisemitic \\"rootless cosmopolitan\\" campaign. Arrested in January 1949, he was tried secretly and executed by a firing squad in the event known as the Night of the Murdered Poets on 12–13 August 1952. After Stalin's death, he was posthumously rehabilitated in 1955, and his complete works were published in the Soviet Union in 1961. Bergelson's only child, Lev, was an eminent Soviet biochemist who also served as a Soviet Army captain during World War II. Prof. Lev Bergelson emigrated to Israel in 1991 with his wife Naomi, where both he and his wife died in 2014.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 26, 1992. In the episode, Homer and Marge quarrel after he embarrasses her at a movie theater. Later Homer visits a redneck bar, where he discovers Lurleen Lumpkin, a talented singer-songwriter, waiting tables. Homer becomes her manager, unaware she has fallen in love with him. When Marge grows upset because she suspects Homer is cheating on her, he must remain faithful to her after Lurleen makes romantic advances toward him. The episode was written by The Simpsons creator Matt Groening, and directed by Mark Kirkland. It is the only episode of the series for which Groening received an individual writing credit. American singer and actress Beverly D'Angelo guest starred in the episode as Lurleen. Although the character makes several cameos after this episode, Lurleen makes her second full-time appearance sixteen years later in \\"Papa Don't Leech\\". The episode features cultural references to songs such as \\"Funkytown\\" by Lipps Inc. and \\"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\\" by Herman's Hermits, and the films Deliverance, Look Who's Talking and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids. Since airing, \\"Colonel Homer\\" has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It attained a Nielsen rating of 14.8, and was the highest-rated show on Fox the week it aired. The episode was selected for inclusion in a video collection of selected episodes, titled The Last Temptation of Homer, which was released on November 9, 1998. An action figure set based on \\"Colonel Homer\\" was released in March 2002, and two of Lurleen's songs from the episode appeared on the Simpsons compilation album Songs in the Key of Springfield. Plot The Simpsons visit the local multiplex: Bart and Lisa see Space MutantsVI, while Homer, Marge, and Maggie see The Stockholm Affair. After Homer makes distracting sounds and loudly reveals the film's ending to the audience, Marge berates him and the other patrons heckle and pelt him with refreshments. Marge tries to apologize on the way home, but Homer is so angry that he drops Marge and the children at home and drives into the night. Homer stops at a redneck bar, where an attractive waitress and singer-songwriter named Lurleen performs country songs on stage. After she sings a song that perfectly matches Homer's predicament, he drives to her mobile home several days later to beg a copy. When Lurleen reveals she has not recorded the song, Homer persuades her to join him at a recording studio. Lurleen's songs are instant hits on local radio stations. Marge disapproves of Homer seeing Lurleen because she fears they will form a romantic relationship. Her fears increase after Homer becomes Lurleen's manager and she buys him an expensive white cowboy suit which he wears at home. Homer denies having an affair with Lurleen but insists he will manage her career with or without Marge's approval. Lurleen's new single, a suggestive love metaphor called \\"Bagged Me a Homer\\", angers Marge. Homer gets Lurleen a gig on Ya-Hoo!, a country western television show modeled on Hee Haw. Homer and Lurleen spend the night before her performance in her mobile home. When she sings a new song asking Homer to \\"bunk\\" with her, he realizes that would violate his marital vows and leaves. During Lurleen's performance, Homer is approached by a business agent who asks to buy Lurleen's contract, but he refuses. When Homer becomes locked in an embrace with Lurleen in her dressing room, his love life flashes before his eyes and he remembers Marge saying she will always love him. Homer tells Lurleen that he only wanted to share her voice with the world and leaves to avoid committing adultery. He sees the agent again outside the dressing room and sells him Lurleen's contract for fifty dollars. Marge is watching Ya-Hoo! at home when Homer returns. Lurleen's bluesy song reveals what Homer did – and did not — do with her. Marge forgives Homer and they kiss passionately. Production =Writing and directing= alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone. The episode was written by series creator Matt Groening, the only episode (discounting the Tracey Ullman shorts) in which he received an individual writing credit, though he has co- written for the episodes \\"Some Enchanted Evening\\", \\"The Telltale Head\\", and \\"22 Short Films About Springfield\\". \\"Colonel Homer\\" was partly based on the 1980 film Coal Miner's Daughter, which tells the story of country music singer Loretta Lynn. Groening said he had always wanted to write an episode in which Homer is offered a chance at being rich and famous, other than being with his family, but then chooses his family over glamour at the end. He pitched the idea to the writers of the show, who suggested the parody of Coal Miner's Daughter and also that Homer should become a manager for a country singer. Showrunner Mike Reiss was originally skeptical about the episode, as he did not think Homer could get a new job when he already had a full-time job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Reiss eventually gave in, but in future episodes the writers tried to develop the explanation that he got fired from the plant and then rehired at the end. Groening said that during the episode production, he received comments from the production team that Homer was acting like a \\"jerk\\" in it, but his explanation was that Homer's behavior was due to his desire to make Lurleen a star and he was oblivious to her attempts to seduce him until the end. Mike Reiss stated that \\"Whenever we want to write stories about characters getting divorced or actually having an affair, rather than with Homer and Marge, which we could never do, we use secondary characters for that.\\" The episode's director, Mark Kirkland, said he enjoyed directing the episode because the characters' emotions throughout it are \\"very human and real\\". He believed many viewers watching the episode would recognize the emotions from experiences in their own lives, and would feel sympathy for the characters. The idea of Homer annoying the people at the movie theater was based on an experience Groening had with a friend of his when he was younger. They were sitting by themselves in a movie theater and two \\"annoying\\" women sat down right in front of them. Groening's friend told the women to move and they did. One of the women then turned to Groening and his friend and said, \\"Now are you satisfied?\\", to which Groening's friend replied: \\"I won't be satisfied until I see you burn in hell.\\" =Voice acting and music= American singer and actress Beverly D'Angelo guest starred in the episode as Lurleen Lumpkin. The actress first met Groening at a party at Frank Zappa's house, and was called in to audition for Lurleen based on her performance as Patsy Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter. She got the role after completing a singing test. D'Angelo wrote two songs for the episode: \\"Your Wife Don't Understand You\\" (which Lurleen sings at the Beer 'N' Brawl where Homer hears her for the first time) and \\"I Bagged a Homer\\". D'Angelo wrote both songs in an hour and presented them to Groening at the episode's table read. Unlike most other guest stars on The Simpsons who record their lines and then leave to accommodate their schedule, D'Angelo stayed with the production team all day and pitched several jokes for the episode. Entertainment Weekly named D'Angelo's performance as Lurleen one of the sixteen best guest appearances on The Simpsons. Tom Nawrocki of Rolling Stone rated the songs D'Angelo wrote as two of the best songs in the history of the show. =Animation= Showrunner alt=A man with glasses and a red shirt is sitting in front of a microphone. The episode marks the debut appearance of Lurleen on The Simpsons. She was created by one of the show's character designers, John Rice. Kirkland thought the first design Rice drew of Lurleen was too \\"bland\\" and \\"plain\\", so they decided to model her after D'Angelo and add \\"every kind of pretty girl cliché\\" into the design. Rice and Kirkland then sent the character to Groening, who sent back a note saying \\"wow\\". Reiss's showrunner partner Al Jean said that \\"one of the most difficult things when translating real people to a Simpsons look is for women to look beautiful\\", as the Simpson overbite and facial construction make it particularly difficult to design women's looks. Lurleen's last name, Lumpkin, came from the country bumpkin character Tony Lumpkin in the 1773 comedy play She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.\\"Colonel Homer Pop-Up\\" special feature, in The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. 2003. Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, wrote in her autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that the episode's script gives the audience a \\"visual and aural feast\\". She said the background designers \\"must have gone on another field trip for this one\\" because they captured the look of a typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own \\"special touch\\" by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off. The property designers went on a field trip to Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio, such as the \\"in session\\" red light, the mixing board, the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters which indicate how loud the artist is singing. For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. The colors in the engineer's booth were darker to make Homer's white suit stand out from the background. The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues. Lurleen's mobile home was designed to be \\"very confined\\" and \\"tiny\\" so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling. Cultural references The episode's title and Homer's attire are references to Colonel Tom Parker, singer Elvis Presley's manager. Films playing at the Springfield Googolplex movie theater at the beginning of the episode include Honey, I Hit a School Bus (a parody of Honey, I Shrunk the Kids), Look Who's Oinking (a parody of Look Who's Talking), and a film called Ernest vs. The Pope which stars the fictional character Ernest P. Worrell. During his long drive to the Beer 'N' Brawl, Homer passes a boy playing a banjo on a porch, a reference to the \\"Dueling Banjos\\" sequence in the film Deliverance. The same boy appears later at the recording studio waiting in line with his banjo to record a CD. William Irwin writes in his book Philosophy and the Interpretation of Pop Culture that this \\"burst of banjo\\" must convey a message even if the viewers do not \\"get\\" the reference to Deliverance: \\"Thanks to prevailing connotations of banjo music, viewers who do not recognize the banjo tune as the theme from Deliverance will not laugh, but the mere sound of banjo tells the audience that Homer has entered a backward, redneck area.\\" The Beer 'N' Brawl redneck bar is based on the bar in the film Urban Cowboy. The Beer 'N' Brawl sells Laramie High Tar cigarettes, a reference to the American cigarette brand Laramie. After arriving home from the Beer 'N' Brawl, Lurleen's song is stuck in Homer's head, and he even sings it to his bowling ball for good luck. Homer's co-worker Lenny decides to give it a shot and sings \\"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\\" to his bowling ball. Homer says that the last song before Lurleen's \\"Your Wife Don't Understand You\\" that he could not get out of his mind was the Lipps Inc song \\"Funkytown\\". The syndicated country comedy show that Lurleen appears on, Ya-Hoo!, is based on the country television series Hee Haw, which ran in syndication from 1971 to 1993.. Reception =Ratings and critical reviews= In its original broadcast, \\"Colonel Homer\\" finished 22nd in the ratings for the week of March 23–29, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.8, equivalent to approximately 16.63 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed rated the episode a5 (of 5) and called it \\"another great\\" episode that chronicles the love between Homer and Marge, showing the \\"ups and downs\\" of their marriage. He said Lurleen's songs are \\"filled with clever observations\\", but it is Homer's befuddlement that makes it a \\"classic\\" episode. Meyers added, however, that country music fans might \\"take offense at Matt Groening's script, which hams up every stereotype imaginable\\". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that after the \\"great\\" previous episode \\"Dog of Death\\", \\"one might expect some drop-off with 'Colonel Homer', but virtually none occurs. It offers another classic episode that benefits from a memorable guest voice performance from D'Angelo. Homer's moment in the sun creates a fun plot and the program nicely lampoons the country music business.\\" The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said the episode is a \\"good example of The Simpsons fixing itself on a target (in this case, country and western music) and extracting every possible gag. Lurleen's songs are all marvelous.\\" Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said he enjoyed the episode, and although it does not contain the \\"usual amount\\" of The Simpsons humor, the \\"rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings. However, anyone allergic to country music should give this one a pass!\\" Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured \\"one of the best\\" parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: \\"While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone [television series Ya-Hoo!], with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven. Homer's sheepish response to Lurlene's advances shows just what a decent, family loving man he is.\\" A reviewer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the episode \\"heartwarming\\", and commented that The Simpsons \\"once again shows that at the heart of this crazy family there is an abiding love\\". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said \\"it's a pretty impossible question for a die-hard fan, but if I were forced at gunpoint to name my favorite episode ever, 'Colonel Homer' would probably be the first to leap to mind, if only for the pure joy that is 'Bagged Me a Homer'.\\" =Lurleen's legacy= Lurleen has made several cameo appearances on the show after this episode. She appears for her second time in the season four episode \\"Marge vs. the Monorail\\", voiced by Doris Grau, as she is briefly interviewed by Kent Brockman during the monorail's maiden voyage party. When he asks her what she has been doing lately, she responds that she \\"spent last night in a ditch\\". She looks dishevelled, and speaks with a harsh, croaky, gravelly voice, rather than the soft, Southern accent she had when she was first introduced. Lurleen also has a cameo in the season four episode \\"Krusty Gets Kancelled\\" as the center square on The Springfield Squares, and appears in \\"Team Homer\\" as a member of the bowling team \\"The Home Wreckers\\". In the season seven episode \\"Bart on the Road\\", Lurleen's name can be seen briefly on a banner saying \\"playing tonight\\" in Branson, Missouri. She made her second full-time appearance in the season nineteen episode \\"Papa Don't Leech\\", in which the Simpsons family takes Lurleen into their home after she becomes a fugitive from the Springfield authorities for not paying her taxes. Merchandise \\"Colonel Homer\\" originally aired on Fox in the United States on March 26, 1992. The episode was selected for release in a video collection of selected episodes, titled The Last Temptation Of Homer, which was released on November 9, 1998. Other episodes included in the set were \\"One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish\\", \\"Homer Alone\\", and \\"Simpson and Delilah\\". The episode was later included on The Simpsons season three DVD set which was released on August 26, 2003. Matt Groening, Mark Kirkland, cast member Dan Castellaneta, and showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss participated in the DVD's audio commentary of the episode. \\"Colonel Homer\\" was again included in the 2005 DVD release of the Last Temptation Of Homer set. An action figure set based on the episode was released exclusively to Toys \\"R\\" Us stores in March 2002. The set, featuring Homer in his white suit and Lurleen with her guitar, is part of the World of Springfield series of The Simpsons action figures created by Playmate Toys. Lurleen's songs \\"Your Wife Don't Understand You\\" and \\"Bagged Me a Homer\\" appeared on the Simpsons compilation album Songs in the Key of Springfield, which was released on March 18, 1997.

Early life Samuel King Allison was born in Chicago, Illinois, on November 13, 1900, the son of Samuel Buell Allison, an elementary school principal. He was educated at John Fiske Grammar School and Hyde Park High School. He entered the University of Chicago in 1917, and participated in varsity swimming and water basketball, while majoring in mathematics and chemistry. He graduated in 1921, and then embarked on his PhD in chemistry under the supervision of William Draper Harkins, writing his thesis on \\"Atomic Stability III, the Effects of Electrical Discharge and High Temperatures\\", a topic closely related to experimental physics. Allison was a research fellow at Harvard University from 1923 until 1925 and then at the Carnegie Institution from 1925 until 1926. From 1926 until 1930 he taught physics at University of California, Berkeley as an instructor, and then as an associate professor. While there he met and married Helen Campbell. They had two children, a son, Samuel, and a daughter, Catherine. X-Rays In 1930 Allison returned to the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in 1942, and the Frank P. Hixon Distinguished Service Professor of Physics in 1959. He studied the Compton effect and the dynamical theory of x-ray diffraction. At the time x-rays were an important means of investigating atomic structures, but the concept that light had both wave and particle properties, as demonstrated by Arthur Compton, was not universally accepted. William Duane from Harvard spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong, and Allison became part of this effort. Duane carried out a series of meticulous experiments to disprove Compton, but instead found overwhelming evidence that Compton was correct. To his credit, Duane conceded that this was the case. One outcome of this was that he co-authored a textbook with Compton, X-rays in Theory and Experiment (1935), which became widely used. He developed a high resolution x-ray spectrometer with a graduate student, John Harry Williams. In 1935, Allison won a Guggenheim Fellowship to study at the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in England, where he studied under John Cockcroft. He published a paper in the Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society on his \\"Experiments on the Efficiencies of Production and the Half-Lives of Radio- Carbon and Radio-Nitrogen\\". He was so impressed by the Cavendish Laboratory's Cockcroft–Walton accelerator that after returning to Chicago he built one. Manhattan Project During World War II, Allison became involved in defence- related work. He was a consultant to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) from October 1940 to January 1941. In January 1941 the NDRC let him a contract to study the possibility of using beryllium as a neutron moderator. The team he assembled in Chicago would grow into the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory. In September 1941, Allison joined the S-1 Section, which coordinated the early investigations into the feasibility of an atomic bomb. He began building a reactor in the squash courts under the disused stands of Stagg Field. He became head of the Metallurgical Laboratory's chemistry section in January 1942, and in March, his small experimental reactor using beryllium came closer to criticality than the graphite-moderated design of Enrico Fermi's group at Columbia University. During 1942, Compton brought all the research groups working on plutonium and nuclear reactor design at Columbia University, Princeton University and the University of California together at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Allison was placed in charge of the experimental work. By October 1942, the Metallurgical Laboratory had to consider how it would proceed with designing large production reactors when they had yet to get an experimental reactor to work. Fermi favored taking small steps, while Allison and Eugene Wigner argued that larger steps were necessary if atomic bombs were to be developed in time to affect the course of the war. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., told them that time was more important than money, and if two approaches looked promising, they should build both. In the end, this was what was done. Allison was one of 49 scientists who watched the project take a leap forward when Chicago Pile-1 went critical at Stagg Field on December 2, 1942. As Compton's reactor project began to spread outside Chicago in 1943, Allison became director of the Metallurgical Laboratory in June 1943. By late 1944, the locus of the Manhattan Project had shifted to the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, and Allison went there in November 1944 as the chairman of the Technical and Scheduling Committee. He was able to inform Groves in March 1945 that an implosion-type nuclear weapon would be ready for testing in July. Allison formed part of the \\"Cowpuncher Committee\\" that \\"rode herd\\" on the implosion project, ensuring that it stayed on track and on schedule. Fittingly, he was the one who read the countdown over the loudspeakers at the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945. Groves presented Allison with the Medal for Merit for his work on the Manhattan Project in a ceremony at the University of Chicago on January 12, 1946. Later life After the war, Allison was director of the Enrico Fermi Institute of Nuclear Studies from 1946 until 1957, and again from 1963 until 1965. He was the chairman of the Physics Section of the National Research Council from 1960 to 1963, and chairman of its Committee on Nuclear Science from 1962 to 1965. He was active in the \\"scientist's movement\\" for the control of atomic weapons. The scientists successfully lobbied for nuclear weapons to be under civilian rather than military control, which was eventually written into the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. He was a strong opponent of secrecy in science, and, in an influential speech announcing the creation of the Enrico Fermi Institute said: Allison rebuilt his accelerator, which he called the \\"kevatron\\", because it could accelerate particles to energies of 400 KeV. The name was a reference to the massive bevatron being built at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which was planned to accelerate particles to billions of electron volts. Allison still believed that there were useful results still to be found with low energies. He became a pioneer of what became known as \\"heavy ion physics\\", accelerating protons and deuterons, and using lithium and beryllium as targets. The data on these reactions of light elements would subsequently prove useful in the study of stellar nucleosynthesis. Later, Allison acquired a 2 MeV Van de Graaff generator, and he recalled an old paper on producing lithium ions from minerals like Eucryptite. This allowed him to produce a 1.2 MeV lithium ion beam. He created hitherto unknown isotopes of boron and other light elements, and measured their neutron capture cross sections. A side effect of this work was a method to analyze surface materials where chemical analysis was unavailable. His colleague Anthony L. Turkevich subsequently used this to analyze the makeup of the Moon on the later Surveyor program missions. Allison continued to take on Ph.D. candidates, some of whom, such as James Cronin went on to distinguished careers. Allison died of complications following an aortic aneurism on September 15, 1965 while attending the Plasma Physics and Controlled Nuclear Fusion Research Conference in Culham, England. His papers are kept at the American Institute of Physics. Bibliography * Notes References  External links *1965 Audio Interview with Samuel K.

Based on lunar dates which are known to belong to the reign of his rival Takelot II in Upper Egypt and the fact that Pedubast I first appeared as a local king at Thebes around Year 11 of Takelot II's rule, Pedubast I is today believed to have had his accession date in either 835 BC or 824 BC.David Aston, Takeloth II, A King of the Herakleopolitan Theban Twenty-Third Dynasty Revisited: The Chronology of Dynasties 22 and 23 in 'The Libyan Period in Egypt: Historical and Cultural Studies into the 21st-24th Dynasties: Proceedings of a Conference at Leiden University 25–27 October 2007,' G. Broekman, RJ Demaree & O.E. Kaper (eds), Peeters Leuven 2009, pp.25-26 This local Pharaoh is recorded as being of Libyan ancestry and ruled Egypt for 25 years according to the redaction of Manetho done by Eusebius. He first became king at Thebes in Year 8 of Shoshenq III and his highest dated Year is his 23rd Year according to Nile Level Text No. 29. This year is equivalent to Year 31 of Shoshenq III of the Tanis based 22nd Dynasty of Egypt; however, since Shoshenq II only controlled Lower Egypt in Memphis and the Delta region, Pedubast and Shoshenq III were not political rivals and may even have established a relationship. Indeed, Shoshenq III's son, the general and army leader Pashedbast B \\"built a vestibule door to Pylon X at Karnak, and in one and the same commemorative text thereon named his father as [king] Sheshonq (III)\\" but dated his actions here to Pedubast I.Kenneth Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100-650 BC), Aris & Phillips, 1996. (3rd ed.) p.339 This may show some tacit support for the Pedubast faction by the Tanite based 22nd dynasty king Shoshenq III.David Aston, Takeloth II-A King of the \\"Theban Twenty-Third Dynasty?\\", Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 75 (1989), p.150 Pedubast I was the main opponent to Takelot II and later, Osorkon B, of the 23rd Dynasty of Libyan kings of Upper Egypt at Thebes. His accession to power plunged Thebes into a protracted civil war which lasted for nearly three decades between these two competing factions. Each faction had a rival line of High Priests of Amun with Pedubast's being Harsiese B who is attested in office as early as Year 6 of Shoshenq III and then Takelot E who appears in office from Year 23 of Pedubast I. Osorkon B was Pedubast I and Harsiese's chief rival. This conflict is obliquely mentioned in the famous Chronicle of Prince Osorkon at Karnak. Recent excavations by the University of Columbia in 2005 reveal that Pedubast I's authority was recognised both at Thebes and in the western desert oases of Egypt--at the Great Temple of Dakhla where his cartouche has been found. He was succeeded in power by Shoshenq VI.

The current Holocene interglacial began at the end of the Pleistocene, about 11,700 years ago. Pleistocene During the 2.5 million years of the Pleistocene, numerous glacials, or significant advances of continental ice sheets, in North America and Europe, occurred at intervals of approximately 40,000 to 100,000 years. The long glacial periods were separated by more temperate and shorter interglacials. During interglacials, such as the present one, the climate warms and the tundra recedes polewards following the ice sheets. Forests return to areas that once supported tundra vegetation. Interglacials are identified on land or in shallow epicontinental seas by their paleontology. Floral and faunal remains of species pointing to temperate climate and indicating a specific age are used to identify particular interglacials. Commonly used are mammalian and molluscan species, pollen and plant macro-remains (seeds and fruits). However, many other fossil remains may be helpful: insects, ostracods, foraminifera, diatoms, etc. Recently, ice cores and ocean sediment cores provide more quantitative and accurately-dated evidence for temperatures and total ice volumes. Interglacials and glacials coincide with cyclic changes in the Earth's orbit. Three orbital variations contribute to interglacials. The first is a change in the Earth's orbit around the sun, or eccentricity. The second is a shift in the tilt of the Earth's axis, or obliquity. The third is the wobbling motion of Earth's axis, or precession. Warm summers in the Southern Hemisphere occur when it is tilted toward the sun and the Earth is nearest the sun in its elliptical orbit. Cool summers occur when the Earth is farthest from the sun during the summer. Such effects are more pronounced when the eccentricity of the orbit is large. When the obliquity is large, seasonal changes are more extreme. Interglacials are a useful tool for geological mapping and for anthropologists, as they can be used as a dating method for hominid fossils. Brief periods of milder climate that occurred during the last glacial are called interstadials. Most but not all interstadials are shorter than interglacials. Interstadial climate may have been relatively warm but not necessarily. Because the colder periods (stadials) have often been very dry, wetter (not necessarily warmer) periods have been registered in the sedimentary record as interstadials as well. The oxygen isotope ratio obtained from seabed sediment core samples, a proxy for the average global temperature, is an important source of information about changes in the climate of the earth. An interglacial optimum, or climatic optimum of an interglacial, is the period within an interglacial that experienced the most 'favourable' climate and often occurs during the middle of that interglacial. The climatic optimum of an interglacial both follows and is followed by phases within the same interglacial that experienced a less favourable climate (but still a 'better' climate than the one during the preceding/succeeding glacials). During an interglacial optimum, sea levels rise to their highest values but not necessarily exactly at the same time as the climatic optimum. Specific interglacials The last six interglacials are: * Marine Isotope Stage 13 (524-474 thousand years ago). * Hoxnian / Holstein / Mindel-Riss / Marine Isotope Stage 11 (424-374 thousand years ago). * Purfleet Interglacial / Holstein / Mindel-Riss / Marine Isotope Stage 9 (337-300 thousand years ago). * La Bouchet Interglacial / Arousa Interglacial / Aveley Interglacial / Marine Isotope Stage 7e (242–230 thousand years ago). MIS 7a, MIS 7b and MIS 7c may or may not be included. MIS 7d was a cold period dividing the MIS 7 interglatial into two distinct periods. MIS 7e contained the climatic optimum. * Eemian / Marine Isotope Stage 5e (130 to 115 thousand years ago). The preceding interglacial optimum occurred during the Late Pleistocene Eemian Stage, 131–114 ka. During the Eemian the climatic optimum took place during pollen zone E4 in the type area (city of Amersfoort, Netherlands). Here this zone is characterized by the expansion of Quercus (oak), Corylus (hazel), Taxus (yew), Ulmus (elm), Fraxinus (ash), Carpinus (hornbeam), and Picea (spruce). During the Eemian Stage sea level was between 5 and 9.4 meters higher than today and the water temperature of the North Sea was about 2 °C higher than at present. * Holocene (12,000 years ago to the present). During the present interglacial, the Holocene, the climatic optimum occurred during the Subboreal (5 to 2.5 ka BP, which corresponds to 3000 BC–500 BC) and Atlanticum (9 to 5 ka, which corresponds to roughly 7000 BC–3000 BC). Our current climatic phase following this climatic optimum is still within the same interglacial (the Holocene). That warm period was followed by a gradual decline until about 2000 years ago, with another warm period until the Little Ice Age (1250–1850).

Augustine Baker OSB (9 December 1575 - 9 August 1641), also sometimes known as \\"Fr. Austin Baker\\", was a well-known Benedictine mystic and an ascetic writer. He was one of the earliest members of the English Benedictine Congregation which was newly restored to England after the Reformation.  Early life  Augustine Baker was born David Baker at Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, on 9 December 1575. His father was William Baker, steward to Baron Abergavenny, and his mother was a daughter of Lewis ap John (alias Wallis), vicar of Abergavenny. His parents were \\"church papists\\" , meaning that although outwardly they conformed to Anglican worship, they remained Catholic by conviction.AUGUSTINE BAKER - That Mysterious Man by Dom David, 14 July 2000 He was educated at Christ's Hospital and at Broadgate's Hall, now Pembroke College, Oxford, afterwards becoming a member of Clifford's Inn, and later of the Middle Temple. In 1598 he was made Recorder of Abergavenny.  Conversion  At Oxford he lost his faith in the existence of God, but after some years, being in extreme peril of death, he escaped by what appeared to him a miracle. Following this, he was led to the threshold of the Catholic Church, and was received into its fold.  Career  In 1605 he joined the Benedictine Order at the Abbey of Santa Giustina, taking the religious name \\"Augustine\\", but ill health obliged him to postpone his religious profession, and he returned home to find his father on the point of death. Having reconciled him to the Catholic Church and assisted him in his last moments, Baker hastened to settle his own worldly affairs and to return to the cloister. He was professed by the Italian Fathers in England as a member of the Cassinese Congregation, but subsequently aggregated to the English Congregation. At the desire of his superiors he now devoted his time and the ample means which he had inherited, to investigating and refuting the recently started error that the ancient Benedictine congregation in England was dependent on that of Cluny, founded in 910. He used the Cottonian Library, which contained many works from Benedictine monasteries in England, placed at his disposal. In collaboration with Father Jones and Father Clement Reyner he wrote up his research in Apostolatus Benedictorum in Anglia. At Sir Robert Cotton's, Baker came in contact with the antiquary William Camden and with other learned men of his day. In 1624 he was sent to the newly established convent of Benedictine nuns at Cambrai (today succeeded by the community at Stanbrook Abbey) in Flanders, not as chaplain, but to aid in forming the spiritual character of the religious. Here he remained for about nine years, during which time he wrote many of his mystical treatises, an abstract of which is contained in the valuable work Sancta Sophia (1657) compiled by Father Serenus Cressy. In 1633 he removed to Douai, where he wrote his long treatise on the English mission, but he was nearly worn out with his austerities before the order came for him to proceed to the battlefield. During his short stay in London, Baker was frequently forced to change where he stayed in order to avoid those tracking him.  Death  Baker died from the bubonic plague in London at the age of 65. He was buried at St Andrew's in Holborn.  Legacy  Of more than thirty treatises chiefly on spiritual matters written by Baker, many are to be found in manuscript at Downside Abbey, Ampleforth Abbey, Stanbrook Abbey, and other Benedictine monasteries in England. Abbot Justin McCann, Master of St Benet's Hall, Oxford (1921–47) and titular Abbot of Westminster from 1947, remains the principal modern editor and interpreter of Baker, with the claim that he is the only man since Fr Cressy to have read all two million words of his writings, always diffuse and unstructured.

He wrote primarily in French and was the first non-French national to be elected to the Académie française. Biography Julian Hartridge Green was born to American parents in Paris, a descendant on his mother's side of a Confederate Senator, Julian Hartridge (1829–1879), who later served as a Democratic Representative from Georgia to the US Congress, and who was Julien Green's namesake. (Green was christened \\"Julian\\"; his French publisher changed the spelling to \\"Julien\\" in the 1920s). The youngest of eight children born to Protestant parents, he had a puritanical and overprotective upbringing, his mother being sexually repressive. Green received a Calvinist education in his religious education as a child, but became a Roman Catholic in 1916, two years after his mother's death. The following year, still only 16, he volunteered his services as an ambulanceman in the American Field Service. When his age was discovered his enlistment was annulled. He immediately signed up with an ambulance unit of the American Red Cross, and when that six-month term of service ended in 1918, he enlisted in the French Army, in which he served as a second lieutenant of artillery until 1919. After the war, he spent three years (1919–22) at the University of Virginia at the invitation of his uncle—his mother's brother—Walter Hartridge. It was his first direct encounter with the United States. He discovered the South, where both his parents had been born. He returned to France in 1922, where, after a false start as a painter, he began his career as a French writer, and by 1927 had established himself in the world of French literature. His career as a major figure of 20th-century French literature began soon after his return from the United States with the novel Mont-Cinère (1926), which was well received by Georges Bernanos. In July 1940, after France's defeat, he went back to America. In 1942, he was mobilized and sent to New York to work at the United States Office of War Information. From there, for almost a year, five times a week, he would address France as part of the radio broadcasts of Voice of America, working inter alia with André Breton and Yul Brynner. Green returned to France after World War II. Julien Green died in Paris shortly before his 98th birthday and is entombed in a chapel designed for him in St. Egid Church, Klagenfurt, Austria.St. Egid, Klagenfurt website. (in German). Retrieved January 25, 2013. His name on the tomb uses the original English spelling \\"Julian\\" instead of the French \\"Julien\\". Writing Most of Green's books focused on the ideas of faith and religion as well as hypocrisy. Several dealt with the southern United States, and he strongly identified with the fate of the Confederacy, characterizing himself throughout his life as a \\"Sudiste\\" (southerner). He inherited this version of patriotism from his mother, who came from a distinguished southern family. Some years before Julien's birth, when Julien's father was offered a choice of posts (with his bank) in either Germany or France, Julien's mother urged the choice of France on the grounds that the French were \\"also a proud people, recently defeated in war, and we shall understand one another.\\" The reference was to France's 1871 defeat in the Franco-Prussian War. In France, both during his life and today, Green's reputation rests principally not on his novels, but on his diary, published in nineteen volumes, and spanning the years 1919 to 1998. These volumes provide a chronicle of his literary and religious life, and a unique window on the artistic and literary scene in Paris over a span of eighty years. Green's style, austere and employing to great effect the passé simple, a literary tense nearly abandoned by many of his French contemporaries, found favor with the Académie française. Green resigned from the Académie shortly before his death, citing his American heritage and loyalties. While Green wrote primarily in the French language, he also wrote in English. He translated some of his own works from French to English, sometimes with the help of his sister, Anne Green, an author herself. A collection of some of his translations is published in Le langage et son double, with a side-by-side English–French format, facilitating direct comparison. Despite his being bilingual, Green's texts remain largely unknown in the English-speaking world. Thus far three of his books have been turned into films: ' (1962), for which he wrote the screenplay, is the most famous. Adrienne Mesurat (1953), and La Dame de pique (1965) were also adapted to film. His stage play South (Sud, 1953) was adapted for a British television production in 1959.Mark Brown, \\"Newly unearthed ITV play could be first ever gay television drama\\", The Guardian, March 16, 2013. Relationships and legacy For many years Green was the companion of Robert de Saint-Jean, a journalist, whom he had met in the 1920s. In his later years Green formally adopted gay fiction writer Éric Jourdan. According to Jourdan, Green decided to move to a house which formerly belonged to Caterina Sforza in Forlì, Italy, in 1994. However, Green did not move to this house because his health was failing. At the Académie française, Green succeeded François Mauriac, taking chair number 22 on June 3, 1971. In 1996, he resigned from the Académie which caused a minor scandal. However, he was only formally replaced upon his death. It was commonly believed he had dual citizenship, but in fact, although born in Paris and writing almost exclusively in the French language, he had never become a French citizen. President Georges Pompidou reportedly offered him French citizenship in 1972 but Green declined.

He was the son of Sir William Dormer, and thus a grandson of Robert Dormer, 1st Baron Dormer. His mother was Alice Molyneux, daughter of Sir Richard Molyneux, 1st Bt. and Frances Gerard. Dormer received the title Baron Dormer at the age of six and on 2 August 1628, at age 18, he was raised to Viscount Ascott and was created Earl of Carnarvon. Early life At age six, Dormer was left a ward to the King. His father had left him a rich peer at an early age. The King then sold Dormer's wardship to Philip Herbert, then Earl of Montgomery, for £4000. Dormer had been brought up as a Catholic and would become a high-living Catholic courtier, in danger, infuriating to hard-line Parliamentarians. He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. He was, according to the seventeenth-century biographer David Lloyd, “extreamly wild in his youth”, and addicted to gambling and hunting. He and his wife are recorded as regular performers in masques at court. He was an ardent Royalist and defying his father-in-law he fought for King Charles I in the English Civil War. Marriage Anne Sophia Herbert, wife of Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon. Portrait by Anthony van Dyck On 27 February 1625, at the age of fifteen, he was married to his guardian's daughter, Lady Anna Sophie Herbert (d.1643), which secured her future as Dormer was one of the wealthiest men in England at the time. Anna was the daughter of Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke and Lady Susan de Vere, the youngest daughter of the Elizabethan courtier, poet, and playwright, Edward de Vere, the 17th Earl of Oxford.G.E.

Civil War Clarendon says before the Civil War he had been given up to pleasure and field sports, but that he broke those habits and became a thorough soldier, conspicuous not only for courage, but presence of mind and skilful generalship (ib vii 216). David Lloyd in his Memoirs of Excellent Personages gives several anecdotes illustrating Carnarvon's character (pp 369–72). Death and legacy Carnarvon was killed at the first Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643 by a lone trooper who chanced upon him returning from a successful cavalry charge. As he lay dying he was asked if he had one final request of the King. \\"No\\", he replied, \\"in an hour like this, I have no prayer but to the King of Heaven.\\"Warburton, loc cit, pg 296. The different accounts of the manner of his death are collected in Mr Money's account of the battle (2nd ed. pg. 90). There is also an elegy on his death in Sir Francis Wortley's Characters and Elegies, 1646. Carnarvon was buried firstly at Jesus College Chapel at Oxford University, but his body was removed in 1650 to a family burial place in Wing, Buckinghamshire. Dormer was succeeded by his eldest son, Charles, who died in 1709 and with him the earldom of Carnarvon in the family of Dormer became extinct. Lady Carnarvon died on 3 June 1643 of smallpox . Anecdotes of her are to be found in the Strafford Papers (ii, 47) and the Sydney Papers (ii, 621) and a poem addressed to her is printed in Choice Drollery, 1656. Her portrait and that of her eldest son, Charles, was part of the exhibition of Anthony van Dyck's works at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1887.

In early material, the character is called King Miro, this was later given in the Filmation cartoon series as King Randor's long-lost father's name. Character history =Filmation animated series/Original toy line= Randor is the good and noble King of Eternia, and the father of the series' hero He-Man, or rather his alter ego, Prince Adam, and (introduced later) Princess Adora, a.k.a. She-Ra. He is often annoyed and disappointed by Adam's seeming laziness and reluctance to take any real responsibility. Not realizing his son's dual identity, he is still very proud of his honest and kind-hearted son. Sometimes he is shown trying to teach his son lessons, as presumably Adam will one day become King. Although Skeletor, the line's main villain, is initially said to be \\"from another dimension\\", late on in the original line it is heavily implied, but never officially confirmed, that Randor's long-lost brother Keldor became Skeletor. However, the writer of \\"The Search for Keldor\\", the minicomic in question, has since confirmed that this was the intent. In the 2002 series, Keldor also becomes Skeletor, although through different circumstances, and there is no acknowledgement that Keldor is Randor's brother. Randor appears regularly in the original series, but it is uncommon for him to be directly involved in the action. However, he features heavily in the storyline of the episode \\"Prince Adam No More\\", in which he displays both his love for his son and his prowess at battling Skeletor's robots. The rest of the 1980s incarnation of the franchise mostly sticks with Filmation's version of a bold, middle-aged, brown-haired king, but some of the franchise's other material presents him as a much older, white haired, almost wizened ruler. =The New Adventures of He-Man= King Randor appears alongside Queen Marlena in the first episode of the New Adventures of He-Man series. Before Adam leaves to travel to the future, he visits his parents and tells them of his mission. Randor watches in amazement as Adam transforms into He-Man before his eyes, and tells his son he is very proud of him. Randor is one of the few characters to appear in both the original series and the New Adventures, and his costume and voice are very accurate to his original portrayal. =Mike Young Productions animated series= In the 2002 Mike Young Productions remake it is made apparent that in his youth, Randor was known as Captain Randor, a brave and steadfast warrior before being crowned King of Eternia by the Elders, although in the 1983 series, he is portrayed as having taken over the throne after his father, King Miro, disappeared. He even aids the Masters in a couple of episodes in their battles against Skeletor and his Evil Warriors and even the Snake Men. Apparently, after King Grayskull's death, the Council of Elders was formed to rule Eternia. But after Keldors' transformation into Skeletor they made Randor king as they became one with Castle Grayskull. He is also tied more closely to the origin of Skeletor, having battled Skeletor when he was still Keldor during a war the Eternians call The Great Unrest. That war ended when Keldor and his forces attacked the Hall of Wisdom, home of the Elders, and Keldor and Randor engaged in a deadly duel that ended with Keldor hurling acid at Randor, only to have Randor deflect the acid with his shield, splashing the acid back at Keldor and burning his face, which led to his transformation into Skeletor. It is revealed by a writer that in this continuity Keldor and Randor are half-brothers, but it is never revealed if either knew that. After the Council of Evil incident, King Randor established an Eternian Council consisting of himself; Chief Carnivus of the Qadians; Lord Dactys of the Speleans; King Chooblah of the Kulataks; Queen Andreeno of the Andreenids; King Taurius of the Mintaurans; Hawk, representing the Avions, and some other unnamed council members. Although in the 2002 edition, he is not aware of his son being He-Man, it may be explained that Adam inherited the inherent skills to become He-Man through the inward bravery of Captain Randor. King Randor will appear in the Live Action He-Man movie. In the film, he will be presented as the great warrior-king of Eternia, a descendant of the Grayskulls, and the father of Adam and step-father to human Keldor rather being his half-brother. Toyline In the original toy-line, despite featuring very much throughout the franchise's run, there was no King Randor figure until a surprise sudden release as part of the final wave. As the final wave was generally produced in less quantity due to sales gradually dipping, the figure is one of the much rarer and more hunted of the original line. The 2002 revamped line was discontinued before a new King Randor figure could be produced; however there was a NECA-produced statue, an action figure-sized piece with no movable joints.Exclusive Masters of the Universe King Randor mini statue from NECA His wife Queen Marlena, never had an action figure version released in either the original or revamped line, although she would finally receive one in the Masters of the Universe Classics line as a San Diego ComiCon exclusive in 2011, that had interchangeable parts so she could also appear in her astronaut persona \\"Captain Glenn\\". In December 2009, a King Randor figure, mostly inspired by the original 1980s figure, was released as part of the Masters of the Universe Classics line. In November 2012, a second King Randor figure, subtitled \\"Eternos Palace\\", was released in the Masters of the Universe Classics line, this time designed to resemble the character as he appeared in the Filmation cartoon.

It was formed in 1991 when Waltrip resigned from Hendrick Motorsports to start his own team, and was originally named DarWal, Inc.. During the 1970s, Waltrip, like many drivers of the time, formed their own teams for racing, in lower levels, originally DarWal, Inc, was his personal licensing agent and operator for many short-track cars he would race at many circuits on non-Cup weekends or special events, and eventually went to Busch Series racing. In 1991, the racing team moved up to the Cup level, with Hendrick support, but he divested himself of Busch operations at the end of the 1993 season. Sold the Busch team to Hank Parker Sr Racing in 1994. Waltrip has also run part-time with his team, with his final NASCAR Truck Series race coming at Martinsville Speedway, where he finished 12th.  NASCAR Winston Cup  The Darrell Waltrip number 17 in 1997 at Pocono DWM debuted at the 1991 Daytona 500 as car No. 17 with sponsorship from Western Auto. (The car number and numbering style were a carryover from Waltrip's days as a driver for Hendrick Motorsports.) Waltrip led at one point during the event, but finished 24th following an accident late in the race. Waltrip won five races over the next two years, with his final top-10 points finish coming in 1994. After that, the pressure of being an owner/driver started to crash down on Waltrip, and his performance declined. After Western Auto was renamed to Parts America, they planned on leaving the team, but stayed on for another year before leaving after 1997. That same year, Waltrip failed to qualify for his first race in 23 years since the 1974 Winston 500 at the fall race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. In addition, DWM briefly expanded to two cars, when Rich Bickle finished 34th at that year's Brickyard 400 the No. 26 Kentucky Fried Chicken Chevy also fielded by DWM, as well as Waltrip running special paint schemes to commemorate his 25th year in the sport. After almost losing his team due to a lack of sponsorship, Waltrip signed Speedblock/Builders Square to sponsor his car in 1998, but they did not live up to most of their obligations as a sponsor, and Waltrip cancelled the contract. Waltrip's last race as owner/driver came at the spring Darlington race that year, driving the Tim Flock Special, a special paint scheme to honor the NASCAR legend who would lose his battle with cancer later that month. After that, Waltrip sold the team to Tim Beverly. The team was so disorganized Beverly temporarily suspended operations to get everything situated. The team returned later in the year as the No. 35 Tabasco Pontiac with Waltrip driving after the team merged with the defunct ISM Racing. Waltrip left at the end of the year after not posting a top-ten finish. This team ran as Tyler Jet Motorsports for the next two seasons. In 2007, Darrell Waltrip admitted that he failed as an owner-driver because he thought more like a driver and not like an owner. Camping World Trucks Rich Bickle driving the DarWal Chevrolet in 1997 In 1996, Waltrip began his own team in the Craftsman Truck Series team, hiring Bill Sedgwick to drive his No. 17 Sears/DieHard Chevy. Sedgwick collected eight top tens and finished 14th in points. In 1997, Rich Bickle drove the truck, winning three races and finishing second in points. After the season, Bickle resigned as he had hoped to run with Waltrip in the Cup series in 1998. Waltrip was about to run Phil Parsons in the truck, but after Sears pulled out, he shut the team down until 2003. In 2003, Waltrip fielded his own truck, this time in partnership with brother Michael and HT Motorsports for a pair of Craftsman Truck races at Martinsville Speedway with the No. 17, the first with Tide (with the Tide with Bleach brand, intentionally reminiscent of his 1989 Daytona 500 win), and the second with the Aaron's promotion of The Three Stooges that ran in various series. DWM became full-time in 2004 as one of the new works Toyota teams. NTN Bearings sponsored the truck for two seasons, driven by David Reutimann, who won the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Rookie of the Year award. The team expanded to a second team in 2005, purchasing the No. 12 truck piloted by Robert Huffman from Innovative Motorsports. Huffman was replaced during the season by Mike Wallace. Joey Miller attempted to pilot the No. 12 truck full-time in 2006, but was released late in the season and the team finished with various drivers. Reutimann ended the season third in points and moved up to the NEXTEL Cup and Busch Series to drive for Waltrip's brother Michael Waltrip. The team became co-owned by Darrell and Michael Waltrip but kept the Darrell Waltrip Motorsports banner, as noted on the Waltrip Racing Web site. As part of changes in 2007 with its move into Michael Waltrip's operations banner, the team became a one-truck team and the number was switched to No. 00 to maintain consistency with the rest of the Michael Waltrip Racing banner, and A. J. Allmendinger drove the No. 00 for a few races to help in his NASCAR experience, with Aaron's as the sponsor, along with Red Bull for a few races early in the season) and Michael Waltrip Racing putting developmental drivers Josh Wise and Ken Butler III in the truck, although Justin Labonte also drove a few races for the team. After one last race with Michael McDowell the team sold off its truck equipment in October 2007 to legendary road racing team The Racer's Group.

Elbert fought in the Revolutionary War, commanding the victorious American colonial forces in a naval battle near St. Simons Island, Georgia on April 19, 1778. He was wounded and captured at the Battle of Brier Creek the following year, though he regained his freedom in a prisoner exchange. He rose to the rank of major general in the Georgia militiaSmith, p. 285 and colonel in the Continental Army. He was brevetted a brigadier general after the end of the war. In 1784, he was elected to the United States Congress, but declined to serve because he did not consider himself physically fit for the task. He did later serve a term as the Governor of Georgia. Elbert was a Freemason. His name appears on the 1779 Masonic membership roles of Solomon's Lodge No. 1 at Savannah along with James Jackson, Governor John A. Treutlen, and Archibald Bulloch. Elbert also served as the last Provincial Grand Master of the first English Provincial Grand Lodge of Georgia in 1785. Life Born in 1740 in Savannah, in British Georgia,Purcell 1951, p.1.Georgia Colonial Records, Vol. V, p.655.Georgia Colonial Records, Vol. X, p.907. Samuel Elbert was the son of Baptist minister William Elbert and his wife, Sarah Greenfield. Elbert’s parents died in South Carolina when he was fourteen. He traveled back to Savannah. Elizabeth Rae Elbert was employed by a prosperous planter named John Rae, an important man in both commerce and government. Rae had built a beautiful home on his land near Savannah known as Rae’s Hall. It was through Rae's influence that Elbert was commissioned to go into Indian country as a trader. He had great success in his dealings with the Indians, mostly because of his kind regard for them. On one occasion, Elbert had been called upon to escort and protect a party of Indians, who had come to Savannah in an effort to redress a great wrong – the murder of a Creek chief called Mad Turkey by Thomas Fee. The incident turned into an issue, and in 1774, feelings ran high between the whites and the Indians. Fee was convicted and jailed. In 1785, Elbert wrote in a letter to George Walton, \\"It is a pity that the people on our Frontiers will behave so cruelly toward those poor savages; not contented with having the lands, but to rob, beat and abuse them likewise is enough to bring down Divine vengeance on their heads.\\"Purcell 1951, p.90. He became engaged to Rae's daughter, Elizabeth. In 1769, they were married at Rae’s Hall, a union which, according to historian Charles C. Jones, \\"confirmed Elbert’s social position and influence.\\"Jones 1886 Elbert became a captain of a grenadier company of Savannah’s First Regiment of Militia in June 1772 and signed a pledge of allegiance to the King of Great Britain as a prerequisite to being commissioned as an officer. =American Revolutionary War= He became active in the Provisional Congress of Georgia and its outgrowth, the Georgia Council of Safety. At the suggestion of a committee of the Council of Safety, the companies of the Georgia Militia decided to elect their own officers. As a result, all officers loyal to the king were replaced with staunch supporters of the oppositionist cause. On February 4, 1776, Elbert was made a lieutenant colonel and later colonel in the Georgia Militia. \\"Samuel Elbert contributed as much as any other man to the early movement for Georgia’s independence\\", according to researcher C. E. Purcell.Purcell 1951 In 1777, Georgia’s president, Button Gwinnett, decided to launch an invasion of Florida to liberate that territory from the British. His plan was to send Colonel Samuel Elbert with 400 continental troops in three galleys and support craft by sea and another element of 109 mounted militia led by Colonel John Baker by land. The two elements were to rendezvous at Saw Pit Bluff, near the mouth of the Nassau River, a site that is presently within the city limits of Jacksonville, Florida.Bennett 1970, p.10. At about the time this expedition was initiated, an ongoing feud between Gwinnett and the commander of Georgia’s Continental troops, General Lachlan McIntosh, resulted in a duel in which both parties were wounded. Button Gwinnett died of blood poisoning three days later on May 19, 1777. Nevertheless, one reason Florida never became a part of Georgia might be found in the vagaries of the wind. May 13, 1777 was the date picked for Elbert and Baker to combine their forces and drive back the British. Many problems prevented Elbert’s sea expedition from reaching its destination on time. While on the boats, the men were stricken by disease, which combined with supply problems and head winds, slowed their progress considerably. In addition, the waters in this area are relatively low in the spring, making navigation somewhat difficult. On May 30, Elbert wrote in a letter to his brother in law, Colonel Joseph Habersham, \\"could we have got the Galleys into St. John’s river, I would, with the men I have with me, made the whole province of East Florida tumble.\\"Purcell 1951, p.35. Colonel Baker’s mounted militia arrived at Saw Pitt Bluff as planned, but quickly moved to a new location when it became apparent that the British already knew of their intentions. During this move, Colonel Baker’s men were surprised by a force of some 400 British troops, and a brief battle ensued in the vicinity of Thomas Creek just south of where it empties into the Nassau River.Bennett 1970 Outnumbered and facing withering fire, most of Baker’s men deserted. Colonel Baker together with his few remaining forces was obliged to retreat, returning to Georgia on May 17. It was about three days later that Colonel Elbert disembarked his troops on the north end of Amelia Island. His forces were joined by a few stragglers from Baker’s detachment, but after reconnoitering, Elbert found the British well entrenched with troops and artillery. While Elbert’s little band was busy trying to cut through the Amelia Narrows, the British commander, Patrick Tonyn, was making plans to attack them with vastly superior forces. To ensure total victory, the British war ships Rebecca and Hawke were ordered out to block any attempt of Elbert’s little flotilla to escape. A violent storm came up, and the British warships were forced out to sea. Before they could return, they encountered a rebel brigantine of sixteen guns. The ensuing battle damaged the Rebecca so badly that it could no longer carry on, allowing Elbert to leave Amelia Island unopposed.Bennett 1970, p.16. Failing to surprise the British and without the support of Baker’s detachment, Elbert and his men returned to Georgia without much having been accomplished. Shortly thereafter, Elbert concluded in a letter to General McIntosh: > I think --- that little can be done, unless by a formidable invasion, which > I judge to be rather too much for Georgia to undertake till her forces are > put on a more respectable footing, and therefore recommend confining our > operations entirely to the defensive till a more favorable opportunity. We > have too many secret enemies amongst us who keep up a regular correspondence > with our Florida neighbors, and until they are put to a stop it will be > impossible for us to enter Florida without their having timely notice of our > approach. A later attempt to invade Florida with a much larger army was initiated by Governor John Houstoun and General Robert Howe in 1778. It was doomed to failure from the start by lack of a unified command. One of the few successes of this second invasion attempt came when Colonel Elbert put 300 of his troops aboard three galleys and caused the surrender of three British warships, his Majesty’s schooner Hinchinbrook, the recently repaired sloop-of-war Rebecca, and a third vessel referred to as a prize brig, all anchored along Frederica. These ships had been harassing the Georgia rebels for almost two years. Prevailing conditions favored Elbert’s little flotilla and it wasn’t long before the British were forced to strike their colors and abandon ship. Having suffered no casualties, Elbert was ecstatic. Elbert's three galleys comprised a good part of the Georgia State Navy at that time. These vessels were the Lee, the Washington and the Bulloch. A fourth galley, named the Congress, was the other galley authorized by the Continental Congress for the state. The galleys were approximately in length and were powered by two lateen sails as well as oars and had a very large cannon mounted in the bow. Although not suited for ocean going, their maneuverability made them formidable in the shallow coastal waters of Georgia. The remarkable success of this enterprise encouraged him to consider launching an attack against another heavily armed British vessel, the Galatea, anchored at the north end of Jekyll Island. Apparently he decided against it, and the Galatea, unable to complete its mission, set sail for St. Augustine, Florida a few days later.Wood 2006 General Howe commended Elbert and his troops for their victory over the British ships and, partly because of this venture, decided to continue with the invasion of Florida. Meanwhile, Samuel Elbert continued with his Continental troops toward Florida. Just after they crossed the Satilla River, on June 24, the first Solar eclipse recorded in the British colonies occurred.Purcell 1951, p.48. It was called \\"the dark day\\" by the troops and may well have been responsible for some of the desertions about then. Elbert, now joined by General Howe, continued on and occupied Fort Tonyn, which had been deserted by the British. It was here that problems began to arise. Houston and Howe were unable to agree on who would lead the continentals in the invasion and the rebel naval commander, Commodore Oliver Bowen, refused to subordinate himself to the Army. This, along with the lack of surprise and widespread illness among the troops, caused the invaders to be halted in a battle at a place called Alligator Bridge. General Howe announced that \\"our principal objective has been accomplished\\" and returned his troops to Georgia. Although the skirmishes between the Patriots and the Loyalists continued, the 1778 expedition was the last of Georgia’s attempts to throw the British out of Florida. In December of 1778, the British sent a fleet with about 3500 troops led by Colonel Archibald Campbell to retake Savannah. General Howe, in command of the city, declined to accept an offer from Colonel Elbert to use Elbert’s regiment to defend a landing place known as Girardeau’s plantation(). As a result, the British were able to land without incident and soon were able to attack the American army from the rear by traversing a swamp under the guidance of a slave named Quamino Dolly.Purcell 1951, p.60. The Americans were soon forced to retreat across the bridge over Musgrove Creek. Although most of the army crossed safely, the British seized the bridge just before Elbert’s command arrived. As a result, Elbert and his men were forced to swim the icy creek to avoid capture. They later joined General Howe about eight miles (13 km) above Savannah. Battle of Brier Creek Savannah was pillaged by the British, and General Howe later faced a court martial for abandoning not only Savannah, but giving up all of Georgia.Purcell 1951, p.62.Coulter 1947, p.138. The defense of Georgia continued with the troops that had not fled to the Carolinas. Among those was Samuel Elbert who, with his remaining troops, briefly occupied Augusta, then deployed to the Brier Creek area where they continually harassed Colonel Campbell’s army as it marched toward Augusta. The weather was cold and conditions harsh. On January 29, 1779, Elbert wrote in a letter to General Lincoln, commander of the Southern army: > The articles of provisions we shall have plenty, of artillery we have none, > small arms very ordinary in general and scarce, many men have come to camp > without any, which we have not to give them. Entrenching tools and camp > utensils are not to be had here.Elbert Letter 1779 In late February, Elbert was joined by General John Ashe and about 1800 additional troops. Ashe deployed most of his troops on high ground near Brier Creek. It was here that Elbert nearly lost his life. Although Elbert was a brigadier general in the Georgia Militia, he was still a colonel in the Continental Army at this time and was in command of one of three divisions under General Ashe. On March 3, 1779, the British launched a surprise attack and quickly routed Ashe’s main army. Ash disappeared into the woods, ostensibly to rally his scattered troops. The remaining left wing, under General Elbert, was driven back against Brier Creek. With Brier creek behind him and surrounded on all other sides by the enemy, Elbert and Lieutenant Colonel John McIntosh together with 60 Continentals and 150 Georgia militiamen, made a heroic effort to turn the fortune of battle without any help from the other two divisions. In the words of the Georgia Historical Commission, Elbert’s small regiment \\"made one of the most gallant stands against overwhelming odds of the Revolutionary War.\\" The British Army was forced to bring up its reserves and, with all hope of escape or victory gone, Elbert surrendered the remnants of his command. More than half of the 150 men killed were Elbert's men. Elbert himself was about to be bayoneted when he was recognized as a Mason by a British officer who ordered his life spared. There is ample reason to believe that, if the other two divisions had fought with the tenacity of Elbert’s command, things might have turned out differently, especially since General Andrew Williamson was on his way with 1200 men and General Griffith Rutherford was coming with 800 men to reinforce the army at Brier.Hollingsworth 1959 As it was, General Lincoln’s plan to win control of the South and bring the war to an end resulted in disaster. General Ashe was later accused of cowardice for leaving the field of battle while Elbert was still engaged, but since nothing could be proved, a court of inquiry found Ashe only guilty of gross neglect. Elbert remained a prisoner on parole in the British camp for more than a year. During this time, he was accorded great respect and kindness. The British made every effort to suborn his allegiance, offering promotion, honors and other rewards, but he remained loyal to the American cause. Elbert was given considerable freedom while being held prisoner, which was unusual given the typically harsh treatment of prisoners at the time. It is a family tradition, however, that this freedom exposed him to a plot upon his life.Johnson 1851 It was attributed to a gang of Tories who had every reason to dislike Elbert since he had been very active against them. Their plan was to have him killed by Indians. While strolling in the woods one day, Elbert encountered two Indians with guns aimed directly at him. He had always extended great kindness to the Indians whenever he had had dealings with them in the past. He made a secret signal to them, and they recognized him as a friend. The Patriot movement at Augusta petitioned the Continental Congress to offer Brigadier General James Inglis Hamilton in exchange for Elbert, and to arrange for his promotion to the rank of brigadier general in the Continental Army.Purcell 1951, p.69. This request was granted after the capture of Charleston by the British in 1780. Elbert went immediately to George Washington's headquarters in the north. General Washington was elated to accept Elbert's services, and at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, Elbert was given command of a brigade. While at Yorktown, he made a lasting friendship with a young French general, the Marquis de Lafayette. This friendship continued after war's end, and these two men maintained a friendly correspondence for many years. Such was Elbert's admiration for Lafayette that he named one of his sons after him. In 1782, the General Assembly of Georgia chose Elbert, General Lachlan McIntosh, Edward Telfair and a number of other prominent Georgians to serve as commissioners at a conference with the Creek and Cherokee Indians regarding their title to certain Georgia lands. A meeting took place at Augusta in May 1783. In a May 31 treaty, the Cherokee ceded a tract between the Tugaloo and Oconee Rivers. According to Hugh McCall's The History of Georgia, Before the conference had ended, the news reached Georgia that a peace treaty had been concluded between Great Britain and her former colonies. =Postwar activities= Many honors were bestowed upon Samuel Elbert. He was elected Sheriff of Chatham County and chosen Vestryman for Christ Church, the first church in the new nation to organize a Sunday school. In 1784, he was selected as one of five delegates from the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization comprising officers who had fought in the Revolution. The same year, he was elected to the General Assembly of Georgia to be a delegate to the United States Congress. This latter honor he was forced to refuse, because he felt, after the long rigors of war, his physical condition was not at its best.  Governor of Georgia  When the General Assembly of Georgia convened at Savannah on January 4, 1785, Samuel Elbert was elected governor of the state, to succeed John Houstoun. Elbert had not sought this honor and he asked for time to give the matter his earnest consideration. On January 7, 1785, Elbert appeared before the House, and formally accepted the honor, saying in part: > I shall ever be sensible of the honor you have conferred on me, in > appointing me Chief Magistrate of the State of Georgia. It must, in the > highest degree, be flattering to me, that my conduct as a soldier through > our last glorious struggle, has met the approbation of my Country; and rest > assured that it will be my study as a citizen to merit the confidence you > have reposed in me. I firmly rely on the concurrence and support of your > Honorable House in every measure that will secure the citizens in their just > rights and privileges and which may be conducive to the welfare of the > State.Purcell 1951, p.75. from the Georgia Gazette, January 13, 1785. In January, 1785, an unusual piece of legislature was passed by the General Assembly for the regular establishment and support of religion in Georgia, mixing Church and State matters. Though governors at that time had no power to vote, Elbert and succeeding governors who found the legislation untenable, ignored it, as stated in the Digest of the Laws of Georgia. As governor, Samuel Elbert was intensely interested in educational and cultural matters. Along with another prominent advocate of education, Abraham Baldwin, Elbert persuaded the Georgia House to pass a bill supporting the \\"full and complete establishment of Public seminaries of learning\\". On January 27, 1785, the House granted a charter to Franklin College, later to become the University of Georgia, and Baldwin became the university's first president. Georgia thus became the first state to charter a state-supported university. The Savannah Morning News stated that this event was \\"... perhaps of more enduring and far- reaching importance and good than any other of this great man's notable career.\\"Purcell 1951, p.80. from The Savannah Morning News of Oct 31, 1920. The matter of taxation came before Elbert early in April, 1785, when William Houston, Georgia's delegate to the United States Congress, wrote a letter informing him that New York and Georgia were the only states that had not conceded the right to levy these taxesthat feeling against Georgia in the national capital New York City at the time was very high, even going so far as to threaten to vote Georgia out of the Union. Undoubtedly, Elbert favored full cooperation with Congress, but governors of that did not wield the power that executives of later years were to possess, and Georgia did not accept the tax. Personal life Elbert and Elizabeth Rae had six children: Catherine, Elizabeth, Sara, Samuel de Lafayette, Matthew and Hugh Lee. That he was a kind and greatly beloved father to his children is evidenced in many records. On November 6, 1788, the following obituary appeared in the Georgia Gazette, published in Savannah:Georgia Gazette November 6, 1788 > Died last Saturday, after a lingering sickness, age 48 years, SAMUEL ELBERT, > Esq. Major General of the Militia of this state, Vice president of the > Society of the Cincinnati, and Sheriff of the County of Chatham.

Honors Grave of Samuel Elbert in Colonial Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia Much of the credit for awakening interest in Georgia's Revolutionary heroes is due to the efforts of William Harden, former longtime librarian of the Georgia Historical Society at Savannah. His interest inspired the Sons of the American Revolution to appoint a committee to locate Samuel Elbert's grave. The grave site was eventually found on an Indian mound overlooking the Savannah River. In a letter to the editor of the Atlanta Journal & Constitution dated May 9, 1971, John L. Sutlive, former editor of the Savannah Evening Press, stated the discovery of Elbert's grave was somewhat accidental. Working on the Rae plantation many years ago, workmen uncovered some bones thought to be those of an Indian, but the fact that there were some military buttons with the skeleton came to the attention of General Robert J. Travis, who rescued them, realizing that they were the remains of Governor Elbert. He kept them in a crate under his desk until reburial arrangements could be made. On March 24, 1924, Samuel and Elizabeth Rae Elbert were re-interred in Colonial Park Cemetery in Savannah. Once again, honors were paid to this man in a military funeral by units from the Army, Navy and National Guard. Elbert County and the town of Elberton were named for him. There is also an Elbert Ward and an Elbert memorial in Savannah. In 1971 a private school named the Samuel Elbert Academy was chartered in Elberton, Georgia. Many markers have been set up by the Daughters and Sons of the American Revolution, the Society of Masons and the Georgia Historical Commission honoring Samuel Elbert.

The proportion of width and length of the flag is 1:2. It is a rectangular three- color cloth consisting of vertical equal stripes of black, white and red (from left to right) with an eight-pointed red cross. The black colour in the flag is a symbol of the earth and stability, red means the sun and life and white means a space and moral purity. The designer of the flag of the Udmurt Republic was Y. Lobanov. The appropriate law N26-РЗ \\"On the National Flag of the Udmurt Republic\\" appeared on April 30, 2002. The emblem The cross/star symbol represents the solar sign, a protective symbol that according to folklore protects man from misfortunes. The cross does not overlap the black and red stripes, and its size is such that it fits within a square whose side is equal to 5/6 of the width of one of the vertical stripes of the flag. The width of the vertical and horizontal cross-bars of the solar sign is equal to one third of the side of this imaginary square. Each arm ends with two symmetrical teeth, the internal sides of which form a 90 degree angle where they meet, a vertex deepened towards the center of the sign at 1/2 arm width.  History  = As the Udmurt ASSR = The first flag of the Udmurt ASSR was described in the first Constitution of the Udmurt ASSR, which was adopted by the Central Executive Committee of the Udmurt ASSR on 14 March 1937, at the 2nd Extraordinary Congress of Soviets of the Udmurt ASSR. The flag was similar to the flag of the Russian SFSR at that time. The flag was a red flag, with the yellow inscription \\"RSFSR\\" in the left corner of the flag, and the inscription \\"Udmurt A.S.S.R.\\" in Russian and Udmurt. Decree on the Flag of the Udmurt ASSR, approved on 29 March 1954. On March 29, 1954, by the decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Udmurt ASSR, a new state flag of the Udmurt ASSR was adopted, which was approved by the Law of the Udmurt ASSR of July 8, 1954. The flag is still similar with the flag of the RSFSR. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2). The flag was a red flag, with a light-blue stripe at the pole extending all the height which constitutes length of the flag. In the upper corner of the flag, there was a hammer and sickle. Below the hammer and sickle were the letters “УАССР” in yellow. The inscriptions changed after the adoption of a new constitution on May 31, 1978. The inscription “УАССР” was changed with the inscription \\"Udmurt ASSR\\" in Russian and Udmurt languages. = Pre-national revival flag = Prior to the national revival in Udmurtia, the national movements in the Udmurt ASSR used a white flag with red and black stripes on the bottom edge, with a black ideogram on a white field. The flag was designed by Kasim Galikhanov. = National revival = During the Perestroika period in the Soviet Union, many of the ASSRs in the Soviet Union began a process of national revival. In Udmurtia itself, the first official flag of Udmurtia was adopted in the 1st All-Union Congress of the Udmurts, organized by the Society of the Udmurt Culture. The flag consisted of three horizontal stripes - red, black and white. The flag was based on a famous poem by Udmurt national poet V. Vladykin Why does a tyuragai sing ().

Despite the fierce fire, the crew isolated the burning wagon by uncoupling the rear portion of the train, then drawing it forward to before uncoupling the burning wagon. With the wagon isolated, the fireman went forward to protect the northbound line while the driver went back in a possible attempt to fight the fire. At this point the depth charges violently exploded, killing the driver and creating a crater 105 feet long to a depth of 50 feet. The line was closed for three days whilst the crater was filled in and the track relaid. Stubbs was subsequently awarded the George Medal and the Order of Industrial Heroism.

The Nederlandse Omroep Stichting (NOS, English: Dutch Broadcast Foundation) found a stereo main microphone system by a number of practical attempts in the 1960s. This system resulted in a quite even distribution of the phantom sources (hearing event direction) on the stereo loudspeaker base, with two small cardioid characteristic microphones, and a recording angle of the microphone system of ±40.5° = 81°. This system got empirical an axle angle of α = ±45° = 90° and a microphone distance (microphone basis) of a = 30 cm. With this system are frequency-independent level differences effective and time of arrival differences working together in the same direction as interchannel signals (interchannel loudspeaker signals). This technique leads to a realistic stereo effect and has a reasonable mono-compatibility. These interchannel differences have nothing to do with interaural differences which come only from artificial head recordings. Even the spacing of a = 30 cm has nothing to do with human ear distance, because a useful microphone system for a set of stereo loudspeakers should be developed and not for ear phones. This recording technology is called mixed stereo or equivalence stereo. Usually this special microphone system must be built up from two single small diaphragm microphones. One should not use double diaphragm microphones because of the produced unbalanced directional characteristics and the larger phase responses. It appears advisable to experiment with the two parameters the axle angle α and the microphone basis a to which there are practical microphone mounting devices. A similar technique is known as the ORTF stereo technique, devised by the French ORTF. With this technique is the angle between the microphone axes α = ± 55° = 110° and the distance between the microphones (microphone basis) is in this case a = 17 cm and gives a total recording angle of 96°. The choice between one and the other depends on the recording angle of the microphone system and not on the distance to and the width of the sound source, the orchestra angle.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 28, 1991. In the episode, Grampa Simpson falls in love with \\"Bea\\" Simmons, another resident at the Springfield Retirement Castle. When she dies and leaves him $106,000, he visits a casino hoping to make more money. After Homer intervenes to stop Grampa from losing all his money gambling, he uses it to renovate the retirement home instead. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and directed by David Silverman. Professor Frink makes his debut in this episode. Audrey Meadows, star of the 1950s TV comedy The Honeymooners, guest stars as Beatrice \\"Bea\\" Simmons, Grampa's girlfriend. It features cultural references to films such as Tom Jones and If I Had a Million, and the Star Wars and Batman film franchises. Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 12.3 and was the highest-rated show on Fox for the week. Plot Grampa falls in love with Beatrice \\"Bea\\" Simmons, a resident at the Springfield Retirement Castle. Homer insists Grampa join the rest of the Simpsons at a cheap lion safari, which causes him to miss Bea's birthday. When he finally returns to the home, Jasper tells him that Bea has died of a burst ventricle, though Grampa believes she died of a broken heart. Deeply distressed by her death, Grampa attends her funeral, where he angrily lashes out at Homer and disowns him. Grampa inherits $106,000 from Bea's estate and initially plans to spend it on himself. After Bea's ghost visits him on an amusement park roller coaster, he instead decides to give the money to people in need. Several of the townspeople visit Grampa with frivolous, greedy, and destructive proposals, disgusting him so much that he goes for a walk to clear his mind. Seeing the plight of Springfield's homeless residents during his walk, he realizes he does not have enough money to solve the city's problems. Grampa goes on a gambling junket hoping to win more money. Homer finds him on a winning streak at a casino's roulette tables and pleads for him to stop while he is ahead. The two struggle over the bet, and Homer manages to drag Grampa's chips off the table just before the wheel stops on a number he had not covered. After Grampa thanks Homer for saving him from losing the inheritance, they reconcile. Grampa uses the money to renovate the retirement home and has the dining room renamed in Bea's honor. Production Cast member Hank Azaria provided the voice of the new character Professor Frink. The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky and directed by David Silverman. The safari was based on the drive-through Lion Country Safari, located in Loxahatchee, Palm Beach County, Florida, which Kogen used to visit when he was younger. \\"Old Money\\" was the first episode to feature Grampa's full name, Abraham Simpson. Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons, named the main characters after his own family members (except for Bart, an anagram of brat, which he substituted for his own name), but refused to name Grampa after his grandfather, Abram Groening. He left it to the writers to choose a name and they chose \\"Abraham\\". The now recurring character Professor Frink makes his first appearance on the show in this episode. Frink was originally written as a mad scientist, but when cast member Hank Azaria ad-libbed a voice for Frink, he did an impression of Jerry Lewis's The Nutty Professor character, and the writing staff started making Frink more of a parody of Lewis. Frink was named after The Simpsons writer John Frink; however, that was before he became a writer for the show. The episode features a guest appearance from American actress Audrey Meadows as Bea. Al Jean, a writer on the show, said Meadows was perfect for the role because she was very sweet, and the staff had a lot of fun during the recording sessions with her. This is the only episode to date where the end credits actually states which character(s) each actor voices. Cultural references The Honeymooners actress Audrey Meadows, shown here in 1959, was praised for her performance as Grampa's new girlfriend, Bea Simmons. The scene with Grampa and Bea eating their pills seductively is a reference to the 1963 film Tom Jones. Two of the people waiting in line to ask for Grampa's money are Darth Vader and the Joker. When the family is suggesting places they could go, Homer suggests the Springfield Mystery Spot, a reference to the Mystery Spot in California—although Lisa says the Springfield Spot is simply a puddle of mud. They eventually decide to go to the Discount Lion Safari, however. The Diz-Nee-Land amusement park Grampa visits with Bea's money has a sign that reads \\"Diz-Nee-Land—Not affiliated with Disneyland, Walt Disney World, or anything else from the Walt Disney Company\\". The shot of Grampa sitting at a diner resembles the 1942 American painting Nighthawks.. Before Grampa attempts to bet all his money on Roulette he quotes the poem \\"If—\\" by Rudyard Kipling. The climax scenes, where Grampa uses the money to fix up the Springfield Retirement Castle, is a reference to the ending of the 1932 film If I Had a Million. Dr. Marvin Monroes 'Monroe Box' is meant to be a spoof of B. F. Skinners Skinner Box. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Old Money\\" finished thirty-sixth in the ratings for the week of March 25–31, 1991, with a Nielsen Rating of 12.4. It was the highest-rated show on Fox that week. The episode was released in video collection on May 4, 1994, called The Simpsons Collection, together with the episode \\"Dancin' Homer\\". Since airing, the episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: \\"a wonderful episode, very sad but ultimately uplifting, with great one-liners (particularly from Grampa)\\". Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide was not as positive. He said, \\"With 'Old Money', we find easily the crummiest episode of season two. Actually, I'd call this clunker the only bad show of the year.\\" He went on to say, \\"I guess 'Old Money' wasn't a truly terrible episode, as it included a few funny moments. However, it seemed like one of the sappiest Simpsons episodes ever. The program became inundated with sentiment, and it did little to leaven that tide. In a generally strong season, 'Old Money' stands out as the only real clunker.\\" References External links * \\"Old Money\\" at The Simpsons.com * * \\"Old Money\\" at TV.com * Category:1991 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 2) episodes ","title":"Old Money (The Simpsons)"},{"id":"2594376","text":"Looking towards Nottingham city centre The Robin Hood statue outside Nottingham Castle Nottingham skyline Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem, reputedly the oldest pub in England Nottingham Trent University's Newton Building Nottingham city centre is the cultural, commercial, financial and historical heart of Nottingham, England. Nottingham's city centre represents the central area of the Greater Nottingham conurbation. The centre of the city is usually defined as the Old Market Square, one of the largest surviving town squares in the United Kingdom. Covering about 12,000 square metres, it is within the boundaries of the centuries-old Great Market Place, which covered about 22,000 square metres. A major redevelopment of the Old Market Square was completed in March 2007. Many of the main shopping streets abut the square, which is dominated by Nottingham's city hall. The building's landmark dome may be seen for miles around. Much of the ground floor of the building houses the Exchange Arcade, a boutique shopping centre. A Bohemian quarter of the city known as Hockley has arisen in recent years, situated close to the Lace Market area. The northwestern end of the city centre is home to the Nottingham Trent University city campus, which contains a mix of old and new buildings. The university's Newton building is one of the tallest buildings in Nottingham and has a prominent position on the city's skyline. Nottingham's central railway station is located in the city centre. Nottingham Express Transit trams also service the area. Shopping Nottingham city centre has been voted 5th in Experian's list of the top 15 UK retail areas. The city centre's fashion core is centred on Bridlesmith Gate, which is home to upmarket names such as Kurt Geiger, Ted Baker and Diesel. Sir Paul Smith's flagship store is located on Middle Pavement, and Hugo Boss is located on St. Peter's Gate. London-based Harvey Nichols now have plans to open a store in the Broadmarsh area but it depends on the development that is due to take place over the year. Zones Nottingham city centre is split into five \\"zones\\", which were introduced with the Nottingham Parksmart scheme in 2009 to signpost visitors to parking facilities and tourist attractions. The zones are named: *Lace Market *Broadmarsh *Castle *Royal *Victoria There is also an area within the city known as the Creative Quarter. Visitor attractions Nottingham Castle is a popular attraction for visitors to the city due to its links with Robin Hood. The Brewhouse Yard Museum (Museum of Nottingham Life) and the Museum of Costume and Textiles are close by. Part of Nottingham's expansive cave network is open to the public through the City of Caves attraction, and the Galleries of Justice on High Pavement were once a fully functioning Victorian courtroom. Notable churches within the city centre include the Roman Catholic Nottingham Cathedral, and the medieval St. Mary's Church at the heart of the Lace Market. The National Ice Centre (adjoined to Motorpoint Arena Nottingham) is located close to the city's Lace Market quarter and is the first twin Olympic ice-pad facility in the UK. It is the home of the Nottingham Panthers, a professional ice-hockey team. Rock City is a mid-sized music venue that draws many popular bands from across the world, and so is an important part of Nottingham's music tourism scene. Entertainment Nottingham is home to a wide variety of entertainment venues, the largest of which is the 10,000-seater Motorpoint Arena Nottingham (part of the National Ice Centre), where many big-name acts perform regularly. The city's major producing theatre, the Nottingham Playhouse, has built up a national reputation for its exciting, innovative and contemporary new works. The Nottingham Royal Centre incorporates the 2,500-seater Royal Concert Hall and the Victorian Theatre Royal. The Royal Concert Hall is the region's top venue for classical music and regularly plays host to world-class orchestras and ballets, while the Theatre Royal is considered one of the finest venues in the country for major touring West End musicals and plays.

According to the 2001 census it had a population of 5,636, reducing marginally to 5,629 at the 2011 census. History Newstead Abbey, a 12th-century grade 1 listed building and ancestral home of Lord Byron, is accessed from the village. After the death of Thomas Becket, King Henry II supposedly to make up for this terrible deed gave the Canons of the Order of St Augustine the land at Ravenshead where they set up a priory, the walls of which can still be seen today. It is here that the name Ravenshead is first encountered. \\"Ravenshede begins at the aforesaidway which lies from Papilwyke [Papplewick] to Blydeworthe, along the hollowroad eastward which is called Thefestyghe: and this leads to the King's highway which is called Nottinghamgate.\\" In the Middle Ages the priory was a stopping place for pilgrims. In 1349 the prior died of plague. The soil in the area is very sandy and unsuitable for growing crops. There is no evidence of a settlement in the area until the 15th century when there was a hunting lodge called Langton Arbor, near present-day Blidworth Dale. The legend of Robin Hood centres on the area of Sherwood Forest in which Ravenshead is located. Although a later addition to the legend it is possible that one of Robin Hood's followers, Friar Tuck, was inspired by the priory. Will Scarlet is also supposed to be buried at nearby Blidworth Church. In 1966 a hoard of gold coins and jewellery was discovered by workmen on a building site near present- day Cambourne Gardens. The coins were probably buried by someone fleeing south after the Battle of Hexham in May 1464. The \\"Fishpool Hoard\\", as it is known, is on display at The British Museum, London. Fishpool, Notts is the name of the area where they were found as the building site did not have the name Ravenshead then (see below). On 17 July 1817, a young girl from Papplewick named Elizabeth Sheppard travelled to Mansfield in search of work. Early next morning her body was found in a ditch. The \\"Sheppard Stone\\" stands next to the A60 marking the spot on the roadside below Portland College and is still regularly maintained. Her ghost is said to appear if the stone is disturbed. Her killer was identified as Charles Rotherham, from Sheffield, who had tried to sell her newly bought shoes and an umbrella. In nearby Thieves Wood, on 23 June 1883, gamekeeper Albert Spinks shot the first example of an Egyptian nightjar in England. He mentioned it to Joseph Whitaker, a naturalist, who recognised it as a rare bird species in Britain. He had the bird stuffed and it is now kept in a museum in nearby Mansfield. No further examples were seen in Britain until 1984. 100 years ago Ravenshead was centred on an area called Fishpool, this name appeared on a 15th-century map. Most of Ravenshead parish was in the parish of Blidworth in the Newark and Sherwood district of Nottinghamshire prior to 1987, with part coming from the parish of Newstead, already in Gedling.  Schools  The village has two primary (infant) schools while the secondary school most commonly attended by pupils from Ravenshead is Joseph Whitaker School in the neighbouring village of Rainworth. = Abbey Gates Primary School = Abbey Gates Primary School, founded in 1967, is a mixed primary school in Ravenshead, which serves mainly the local village community, with about a third of the pupils coming from farther away. The number of pupils claiming a free school meal is below average, as is the proportion with learning difficulties or disabilities. An average number have a statement of Special Educational Needs. Fewer pupils than average come from minority ethnic groups. The attainment of pupils on entry to the school is in line with that expected nationally for children of this age. The Foundation Unit is recognised as a centre of excellence. (Ofsted, 2006) In 2006, Darren Powell, a teacher at Abbey Gates, produced a short film featuring members of his class titled, \\"Body Image for Beginners,\\" which was shown on Teacher's TV.Teacher's TV: Action!

Amenities Ravenshead is home to the Longdale Lane Craft Centre, the oldest centre of its type in the UK. NB:- The Craft Centre has been demolished with its land awaiting development. In the centre of the village there are also several shops including a newsagent, chemist, a fish and chip shop and a Chinese takeaway. The village has an Esso petrol station, a Sainbury’s Local and a Nisa convenience store and a large leisure centre with tennis courts and football pitches, but no swimming pool. There are four pubs: The Hutt Inn, Little John, Sherwood Ranger and Larch Farm. It also has an Italian Restaurant and Bar Santini. Residents Ravenshead is a very affluent area of the East Midlands with much higher than average property prices and a diverse population of professional people, elderly people and skilled workers. It also serves as a commuter village to Nottingham. Farming was the main occupation in the area until the arrival of the local shops and schools. The only other industry in Ravenshead was sand quarrying. The first quarry was opened in 1919 to provide building sand for Nottingham and Hucknall.

History The station was opened on 19 July 1849 by the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway when it opened the line between and . In 1914 at the start of World War I the passing loop was expanded to cater for the increased length of trains and to help with the extended length of trains brought about by World War I. In May 1916 the shunting neck was extended and an additional 90 yards of sidings were provided. The station was host to six LMS caravans from 1937 to 1939. The station was a passing loop until the 1970s when it was singled due to fall-off in traffic and train frequency. It was particularly busy with passenger traffic in the 1940-50s when it served the Nethertown military camp for training anti-aircraft gunners, which was taken over after the war for the construction workers building the Sellafield Nuclear plant.

The station has the distinction of being the most westerly in Northern England. History The Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway, a line which would link the town of Whitehaven with the Furness Railway at , was authorised in 1847. It was opened in stages and the first section, that between Whitehaven and , opened on 1 June 1849. St Bees station opened on 21 July 1849. In 1848 Canon Richard Parkinson, Vicar of St Bees and Principal of the Theological College, wrote in his diary: \\"November 8th., 1848. The Railway-whistle heard for the first time in this quiet valley. Its peace is gone!\\" Later, on 12 February 1849, he records, \\"Ash Wednesday. Good congregation.

Despite deploring this shattering of the valley's peace, Parkinson travelled on the official train when the line was opened as far as Ravenglass in 1849.

Pub 2012 by Barria books, Barrow. =Derailment= At about 6:45 am on 30 August 2012 a two-carriage passenger train en route to Sellafield was derailed a mile south of St Bees following a landslide caused by heavy rain. Extensive civil engineering repair work has now been carried out to prevent a recurrence. In addition the underbridge at Seamill Lane was replaced in 2013. Description The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line, south-west of Carlisle. It is operated by Northern who provide all passenger train services. The station master's house and ticket office, on the up (southbound) platform, date from 1860 and was formerly a restaurant with a railway theme, but is now a private house. On the down (northbound) platform, the waiting room is still a period timbered Furness railway structure, slightly modified to become a private dwelling. To the east of the \\"up\\" platform is the site of the goods yard which was heavily used for the stone traffic from the sandstone quarries at St Bees in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also handled the traffic from Walker's scone flour works and pickle factory, and the luggage traffic for St Bees School at the beginning and end of term.\\"100 Years of St Bees\\", Douglas Sim. 1995, The yard is now a public car park which is subsidised for free public use by the Parish Council.Report of the St Bees PC Chairman 2010-2011, published as an insert in the \\"St Bees News\\". The coal yard was off the down line on the north side of the level crossing. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps from the road, and the low platforms have Harrington Humps for mobility-impaired users. Following the introduction of four-carriage locomotive working, in 2016 both platforms were extended by re-instatement of sections of unused platform. Train running information is offered via timetable posters, CIS screens and telephone. Tickets can be bought from a vending machine at the station or on the train. =Signal box= The Arts and Crafts design signal box, showing its architectural features The station has a 24 lever signal box, which was opened in 1891 to meet the heavy traffic demands of that time. In December 2013 this was designated a Grade 2 listed building, being one of the few in the UK built in the \\"Arts and Crafts\\" style. This is a Furness Railway type 3 design. The English Heritage listing recommendation report says: \\"The Type 3 design is one of the most distinctive boxes ever erected, in an arts and crafts style, probably influenced by the stations that Austin & Paley were designing for the Furness Railway. It has a tall battered base in stone and a steeply pitched tiled hipped roof. Tall window frames are individually grouped. Unfortunately the survivors have all had their windows replaced but this has altered their character less than other boxes with larger expanses of window and more complicated patterns of glazing. Examples survive at Park South (1883) and St. Bees (1891), the latter in an attractive rural setting is worth consideration [for listing].\\" The level crossing is controlled by the signalman, who is also responsible for delivering the key tokens for both single line sections to train crews. =Position= The station is in the centre of the village, and there are three pubs within easy walking distance: one, the Albert, formerly being noted for having warning of the approaching trains rung through from the signal box in the evening. The beach, and the start of the Coast to Coast Walk are a 20-minute walk away. St Bees Golf Halt St Bees Golf Halt was provided about a mile south of the village for golfers visiting the golf course.

They are presented by the Outer Critics Circle (OCC), the official organization of New York theater writers for out-of-town newspapers, digital and national publications, and other media beyond Broadway. The awards were first presented during the 1949–50 theater season and will celebrate their 70th anniversary in 2020. David Gordon, Senior Features Reporter at TheaterMania.com, currently serves as President. History The Outer Critics Circle was founded as the Outer Circle during the Broadway season of 1949–50 by an assortment of theater critics led by John Gassner, a reviewer, essayist, dramaturg, and professor of theater. These critics were writing for academic publications, special interest journals, monthlies, quarterlies, and weekly publications outside the New York metro area, and were looking for a forum where they could discuss the theater in general, particularly the current New York season. The creation of the OCC was also a reaction to the New York Drama Critics Circle, which did not allow critics of lesser-known publications to join their ranks alongside writers of major New York and national publications. The first awards (for 1949–50) were: The Cocktail Party (Play); The Consul (Musical); Sheila Guyse, Performances in Supporting Roles for Lost in the Stars, and Daniel Reed, Performances in Supporting Roles for Come Back, Little Sheba. In the early 1960s, the awards and forums of the OCC were supervised by Broadway veteran Charles K. Freeman and Joseph Kay, Manhattan reporter/critic for the Kansas City Star. This team was succeeded by Marjorie Gunner, who guided the group for 25 years before retiring in 2004. Simon Saltzman, a New Jersey-based theater critic, served as President until 2018, when he was succeeded by David Gordon of TheaterMania. In addition to Gordon (President) and Saltzman (now Vice President), the Board of Directors currently includes Joseph Cervelli (Recording Secretary), Patrick Hoffman (Corresponding Secretary), David Roberts (Treasurer), Harry Haun (Historian), Cynthia Allen (Web Editor), Richard Ridge (Member), Janice Simpson (Member), and Stanley L.

In May 1955, the incline was re-opened, this time to serve the factory of Marchon Products - a subsidiary of Albright and Wilson - at Kells.

The original building was constructed in 1906, at 128 West Prairie Avenue. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. With . It was the first free library in the city. History At Thanksgiving 1897, Jane Addams, founder of Hull House in Chicago, was a guest of her sister, S. Alice Haldeman, in Girard, an active worker in the Presbyterian Church. Miss Addams gave a talk at the church on \\"Social Settlements,\\" and was surprised to learn at this time that Girard was without a public library, although Cherokee and Weir City had already taken such a step. In January 1898, Mrs. McKay, president of the Ladies Reading Club, appointed Mrs. Haldeman, Mrs. Griffin, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Wasser a committee to study the situation. A year later, January 21, 1899, representatives of the Ladies Reading Club, the Mutual Improvement Club, and the Sunflower Club met with Mrs. Haldeman and formed the Federation of City Clubs. At another meeting exactly one week later the Federation organized the Girard Library Association. Offices were in the county courthouse until being moved to the McMillan building on the south side of the square, over E. Beadle's Store, in the spring of 1901. Mrs. Eva Mitchell was chosen as the first librarian. At that time the library had 370 books, and the librarian received 50 cents per day for keeping it open from 2 to 9 P.M. on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. Miss Blanche Warren became librarian in December, 1901, and served until 1936, by far the longest service of anyone who has held this post. In 1905, Lewis H. Phillips, an attorney, backed by the Commercial Club and other organizations, succeeded in obtaining $8,000 from Andrew Carnegie on the condition that the city council would pledge maintenance. The city council acted promptly, and it was said that at a population of about 2,500, Girard was the smallest city in the world to have a Carnegie Library at that time. It was also rumored that Jane Addams was a friend of Andrew Carnegie and may have had something to do with obtaining the money. Two lots were considered for the building of the Carnegie Library. The one chosen was the Viets lot, offered by Marion Coulter, who lived across the street to the south. The price of this 100 x 95 foot lot was $500, all of which had been pledged by residents of the neighborhood. The other lot was the Wasser lot, 100 x 100, on the northeast corner of Buffalo and Osage, opposite the home of J. E. Raymond, who offered to pay for it, the cost also being $500. By a vote of 4 to 2 the board decided on the Viets lot because it was closer to the square, although inferior to the other location in some respects. An expansion and addition to the original Carnegie building was made in 2002. Predecessors Girard's Carnegie library was not the first library in the city. *In February 1870, the Crawford County Library Association met at Crawfordsville, located approximately 5 miles west of present-day Girard. *In December 1871, the Girard Literary Institute and Library Association held a meeting. In 1875, the librarian of that organization published thanks to several individuals who had made valuable donations to the library. *In 1882 there were over 500 books in the Public Library, and 95 new volumes had been ordered. Dr. G. A. Keyes was librarian, and kept the library in his office on the south side of the square, and John Randolph was president. It was open to members of the association at a cost of $1 per year. A festival was held that year for the benefit of the library. The same year mention was made of the A. O. U. W. (Ancient Order of United Workmen) Library. *In 1884 John Randolph was chairman at a meeting held in the courthouse for the purpose of considering the establishment of a free library. *In 1889 a circulating library was being established in the Veatch Music Store by two college students.

History A 1904 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing railways in the vicinity of Whitehaven (FR in blue; LNWR in red) The first station at Whitehaven was opened on 19 March 1847 by the Whitehaven Junction Railway (WJR) as the terminus of their line from . This station lay to the south of the present station, with the main entrance on Bransty Row (at ). On the southern side of the town, the first section of the Whitehaven and Furness Junction Railway (W&FJR;) opened on 1 June 1849 from a terminus at Whitehaven (Preston Street) to , but there was no connection between this line and the WJR suitable for passenger trains. In between the two stations stood the town centre, and to the east of that Hospital Hill, so a tunnel long was built beneath the latter, being completed in July 1852. In 1854, the W&FJR; passenger trains began using the WJR station at Whitehaven (Preston Street becoming a goods-only station). In 1865, the W&FJR; was absorbed by the Furness Railway (FR), and in 1866, the WJR was absorbed by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). The LNWR station (formerly WJR) was replaced on 20 December 1874 by a new one named Whitehaven Bransty; it was jointly owned by the LNWR and the FR. This station had its name simplified to Whitehaven on 6 May 1968. The original buildings were demolished and replaced by a modern single-story ticket hall in the mid-1980s.Railscot - Photos of Whitehaven Railscot; Retrieved 2 December 2016 The former goods yard site beyond and behind platform one is now occupied by a supermarket. The station formerly had four operational platforms, but today only two remain in use (the former platforms three and four having lost their tracks when the layout was simplified and the buildings replaced). The double line from Parton becomes single opposite the station signal box (which still bears the original station name Whitehaven Bransty) and then splits into two - one runs into platform one (a bay used by most terminating services from Carlisle) and the other runs into platform two, which is the through line to Sellafield, Millom and Barrow. Trains heading south must collect a token for the single line section to St Bees from a machine on the platform (with the co-operation of the signaller) before they can proceed. Conversely trains from Barrow must surrender the token upon arrival, the driver returning it to the machine before departing for Workington. Only then can the signaller allow another train to enter the single line section. Facilities The ticket office is open six days per week (closed evenings and Sundays) and there is also a ticket machine available. Digital display screens, a P.A system and information posters provide train running information.

It was introduced in 1963 to support D&B;'s credit reporting practice. It is standard worldwide. DUNS users include the European Commission, the United Nations, the United States government, and Apple. More than 50 global industry and trade associations recognize, recommend, or require DUNS. The DUNS database contains over 300 million entries for businesses throughout the world.  Details  The DUNS number is a nine-digit number, issued by D&B;, assigned to each business location in the D&B; database, having a unique, separate, and distinct operation for the purpose of identifying them. The DUNS number is random, and the digits have no apparent significance. Until approximately December 2006, the DUNS number contained a mod-10 check digit to support error detection. Discontinuing the check digit increased the inventory of available DUNS numbers by 800 million. As of 25 February 2017, the website shows that there is no charge to get a DUNS number, and the time to create the number is 24 to 48 hours. When obtaining a DUNS number online, the wait is usually 30 business days, but assignment of a number can be immediate for UK businesses who provide their company registration number. When purchasing the \\"Small Business Starter\\" from Dun & Bradstreet Credibility Corp the wait time reduces to 5 business days or less. Unlike national employer identification numbers, a DUNS number may be issued to any business worldwide. Certain U.S. government agencies require that a vendor have a DUNS number as well as a U.S. Employer Identification Number (EIN). Other agencies, such as some United Nations offices and Australian government agencies, require certain businesses to have a DUNS number. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), a United States federal agency, announced in the 27 June, 2003 issue of the Federal Register that a DUNS number would be required for all grant applicants for new or renewal awards submitted on or after 1 October, 2003. The DUNS number is a supplement to other identifiers, such as the EIN, and is required whether the application is made electronically or on paper. A DUNS number is sometimes formatted with embedded dashes to promote readability, such as \\"15-048-3782\\". Modern usage typically omits dashes, and shows the number as in the form \\"150483782\\". The dashes are not part of D&B;'s official definition of the DUNS number. Businesses may choose to append four extra alphanumeric characters to their DUNS number. This is called a DUNS+4 number. The suffix is for the use of the business (for example, to identify different electronic funds transfer accounts). It has no significance otherwise and is not tracked by Dun & Bradstreet. Numerous other business-numbering systems exist independent of DUNS—for example, the International Suppliers Network system. However, few, if any, register as many international businesses as with DUNS. Prior to DUNS numbers, the U.S. government used another coding system known as ACASS. The ACASS number was abolished on 5 October, 2005, when a modernized platform replaced the ACASS system. The ACASS system now uses the DUNS number, rather than the former ACASS number.

The book immediately took rank as one of the highest modern authorities on the subject, and by 1887 the first French edition had become enlarged to six volumes. Calvo's next publications were of a semi-historical character. Between 1862 and 1869 he published in Spanish and French his great collection in fifteen volumes of the treaties and other diplomatic acts of the South American republics, and between 1864 and 1875 his Annales historiques de la révolution de l'Amérique latine, in five volumes. In 1884 he was one of the founders at the Ghent congress of the Institut de Droit International. In the following year he was Argentine minister at Berlin, and published his Dictionnaire du droit international publique et privat in that city. References * * \\"Carlos Calvo\\".

Italian Renaissance engraving. Lesbianism is the sexual and romantic desire between females. There are historically far fewer mentions of lesbianism than male homosexuality, due to many historical writings and records focusing primarily on men. Ancient Greece  The evidence about female homosexuality in the ancient Greek world is limited, with it being hardly mentioned in extant Greek literature. Most surviving sources from the classical period come from Athens, and they are without exception written by men. At least among these Athenian men, the discussion and depiction of female homosexual activity seems to have been taboo. Kenneth Dover suggests that, due to the role played by the phallus in ancient Greek men's conceptions of sexuality, female homosexual love was not conceivable as a category to the authors of our surviving sources. Nonetheless, there are a few references to female homosexuality in ancient Greek literature. Two poets from the archaic period, Sappho and Alcman, have been interpreted as writing about female homosexual desire. Alcman wrote hymns known as partheneia,\\"Maiden-songs\\", so-called because they were apparently composed for choruses of young girls to sing as part of religious celebrations. which discuss attraction between young women. Though it is ambiguous, historians have considered the attraction in question to be erotic or sexual. At roughly the same time, Sappho's poems discuss her love for both men and women. For instance, in Sappho's Ode to Aphrodite, the poet asks Aphrodite for aid in wooing another woman. It is noticeable that the fragment describes Sappho both giving to and receiving sexual contact from the same partner, in contrast with the rigid active/passive partner dichotomy observed in Greek male homosexual relationships. Only one fragment of Sappho's poetry, Sappho 94, contains a clear mention of female homosexual acts. In classical Athens, the idea of homosexual women is briefly mentioned in the Speech of Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium. Later references to female homosexuality in Greek literature include an epigram by Asclepiades, which describes two women who reject Aphrodite's \\"rules\\" but instead do \\"other things which are not seemly\\".Asklepiades, The Greek Anthology 5.207 Dover comments on the \\"striking\\" hostility shown in the epigram to female homosexuality, contrasting it with Asclepiades' willingness to discuss his own homosexual desire in other works, suggesting that this apparent male anxiety about female homosexuality in ancient Greece is the reason for our paucity of sources discussing it. In Greek mythology, the story of Callisto has been interpreted as implying that Artemis and Callisto were lovers. The myth of the Amazons has also been interpreted as referring to female homosexual activities. Female-female relationships or sexual activities were occasionally depicted on Greek art. An early example of this is a plate from archaic Thera, which appears to show two women courting. An Attic red figure vase in the collection of the Tarquinia National Museum in Italy shows a kneeling woman fingering the genitals of another woman, in a rare example of sexual activity between women being explicitly portrayed in Greek art. Alexandre Isailoff - Sappho Sappho is the most often mentioned example of an ancient Greek woman who may have actually engaged in sexual acts with women. Her sexuality has been debated by historians, with some such as Denys Page arguing that she was attracted to women, while others, such as Eva Stigers, arguing that the descriptions of love between women in Sappho's writings are not evidence for her own sexuality. Some historians have gone so far as to argue that Sappho's circle were involved in female homosexuality as a kind of initiation ritual. The earliest evidence of Sappho's reputation for homosexual desire comes from the Hellenistic period, with a fragment of a biography found in the Oxyrhynchus Papyri which mentions that Sappho is criticised for being \\"gynaikerastria\\".I.e. a woman who loves other women. Similarly, some find evidence in Plutarch that Spartan women engaged in homosexual activities, though Plutarch wrote many centuries after classical Greece. In Plutarch's biography of Lycurgus of Sparta, part of his Parallel Lives, the author claims that older Spartan women formed relationships with girls that were similar to the erastes/eromenos relationships that existed between some older and younger male Greeks. Sarah Pomeroy believes that Plutarch's depiction of homosexual relationships between Spartan women is plausible. For instance, she argues, in the girls' choirs that performed the partheneia of Alcman, homosexual relationships between the girls would have \\"flourished\\". Roman Empire and early Christianity The lesbian love story between Iphis and Ianthe, in Book IX of Ovid's the Metamorphoses, is most vivid. When Iphis' mother becomes pregnant, her husband declares that he will kill the child if it is a girl. She bears a girl and attempts to conceal her sex by giving her a name that is of ambiguous gender: Iphis. When the \\"son\\" is thirteen, the father chooses a golden-haired maiden named Ianthe as the \\"boy's\\" bride. The love of the two girls is written sympathetically: > They were of equal age, they both were lovely, > Had learned the ABC from the same teachers, > And so love came to both of them together > In simple innocence, and filled their hearts > With equal longing. However, as the marriage draws ever closer, Iphis recoils, calling her love \\"monstrous and unheard of\\". The goddess Isis hears the girl's moans and turns her into a boy. Suburban Baths, Pompeii References to love between women are sparse. Phaedrus attempted to explain lesbianism through a myth of his own making: Prometheus, coming home drunk from a party, had mistakenly exchanged the genitals of some women and some men – \\"Lust now enjoys perverted pleasure.\\" It is quite clear that paiderastia and lesbianism were not held in equally good light, possibly because of the violation of strict gender roles. Seneca the Elder mentions a husband who killed his wife and her female lover and implies that their crime was worse than that of adultery between a male and female. The Babyloniaca of Iamblichus describes an Egyptian princess named Berenice who loves and marries another woman. This novelist also states that such love is \\"wild and lawless\\". Another example of the gender-sexual worldview of the times was documented in Lucian's Dialogues of the Courtesans, in which Megilla renames herself Megillus and wears a wig to cover her shaved head. She marries Demonassa of Corinth, although Megillus is from Lesbos. Her friend Leaena comments that \\"They say there are women like that in Lesbos, with faces like men, and unwilling to consort with men, but only with women, as though they themselves were men\\". Megillus seduces Leaena, who feels that the experience is too disgusting to describe in detail. In another dialogue ascribed to Lucian, two men debate over which is better, male love or heterosexuality. One man protested that if male affairs were legitimized, then lesbianism would soon be condoned as well, an unthinkable notion. The apocryphal Apocalypse of Peter describes the punishment of both male and female homosexuals in Hell: The canonical New Testament usually mentions homosexuality in only general terms (i.e. mentioning both men and women who had engaged in sexual acts with the same sex) and both are equally condemned. Women who'd done this were only mentioned once however. Medieval period In medieval Europe, the Christian Church took a stricter view of same-sex relations between women. Penitentials, developed by Celtic monks in Ireland, were unofficial guidebooks which became popular, especially in the British Isles. These books listed crimes and the penances that must be done for them. For example, \\"...he who commits the male crime of the Sodomites shall do penance for four years\\". The several versions of the Paenitentiale Theodori, attributed to Theodore of Tarsus, who became archbishop of Canterbury in the 7th century, make special references to lesbianism. The Paenitentiale states, \\"If a woman practices vice with a woman she shall do penance for three years\\".Paenitentiale Umbrense, 2.12 Penitentials soon spread from the British Isles to mainland Europe. The authors of most medieval penitentials either did not explicitly discuss lesbian activities at all, or treated them as a less serious sin than male homosexuality. The Old French legal treatise Li livres de jostice et de plet (c. 1260) is the earliest reference to legal punishment for lesbianism akin to that for male homosexuality. It prescribed dismemberment on the first two offences and death by burning for the third: a near exact parallel to the penalty for a man, although what \\"dismemberment\\" could mean for a medieval woman is unknown. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place. In the Holy Roman Empire under Charles V, a law on sexual offences specifically prohibits sex acts between women. There exist records of about a dozen women in the medieval period who were involved in lesbian sex, as defined by Judith Bennett as same-sex genital contact. All of these women are known through their involvement with the courts, and were imprisoned or executed. An early example of a woman executed for homosexual acts occurred in 1477, when a girl in Speier, Germany, was drowned. Not all women were so harshly punished, though. In the early fifteenth century, a Frenchwoman, Laurence, wife of Colin Poitevin, was imprisoned for her affair with another woman, Jehanne. She pleaded for clemency on the grounds that Jehanne had been the instigator and she regretted her sins, and was freed to return home after six months imprisonment. A later example, from Pescia in Italy, involved an abbess, Sister Benedetta Carlini, who was documented in inquests between 1619 and 1623 as having committed grave offences including a passionately erotic love affair with another nun when possessed by a Divine male spirit named \\"Splenditello\\". She was declared the victim of a \\"diabolical obsession\\" and placed in the convent's prison for the last 35 years of her life. In the medieval Arab world, lesbianismUnlike contemporary European languages, medieval Arabic had terms meaning \\"lesbian\\" and \\"lesbianism\\": \\"sihaqa\\" and \\"sahq\\" respectively. was considered to be caused by heat generated in a woman's labia, which could be alleviated by friction against another woman's genitalia. Medieval Arabic medical texts considered lesbianism to be inborn: for instance, Masawaiyh wrote that a girl became a lesbian if her nurse ate specific foods, such as celery and rocket. The earliest story about lesbianism in Arabic literature comes from the Encyclopedia of Pleasure, and tells the story of the love between a Christian and an Arab woman, and we know from the Fihrist, a tenth-century catalogue of works in Arabic, of writings about twelve other lesbian couples which have not survived. Between 1170 and 1180 Maimonides, one of the foremost rabbis in Jewish history, compiled his magnum opus, the Mishneh Torah. It is the only Medieval-era work that details all of Jewish observance, and as regarding lesbianism states: > For women to be mesollelot [women rubbing genitals against each other] with > one another is forbidden, as this is the practice of Egypt, which we were > warned against: \\"Like the practice of the land of Egypt ... you shall not > do\\" (Leviticus 18:3). The Sages said [in the midrash of Sifra Aharei Mot > 8:8–9], \\"What did they do? A man married a man, and a woman married a woman, > and a woman married two men.\\" Even though this practice is forbidden, one is > not lashed [as for a Torah prohibition] on account of it, since there is no > specific prohibition against it, and there is no real intercourse. > Therefore, [one who does this] is not forbidden to the priesthood because of > harlotry, and a woman is not prohibited to her husband by this, since it is > not harlotry. But it is appropriate to administer to them lashings of > rebellion [i.e., those given for violation of rabbinic prohibitions], since > they did something forbidden. And a man should be strict with his wife in > this matter, and should prevent women known to do this from coming to her or > from her going to them. Female homoeroticism, however, was so common in English literature and theatre that historians suggest it was fashionable for a period during the Renaissance. Early Modern period In early modern England, female homosexual behaviour became increasingly culturally visible. Some historians, such as Traub, have argued that this led to increasing cultural sanctions against lesbian behaviours. For instance, in 1709 Delariviere Manley published The New Atlantis, attacking lesbian activities. However, others, such as Friedli and Faderman have played down the cultural opposition to female homosexuality, pointing out that it was better tolerated than male homosexual activities. Additionally, despite the social stigma, English courts did not prosecute homosexual activities between women, and lesbianism was largely ignored by the law in England. For instance, Mary Hamilton (the \\"Female Husband\\", as Henry Fielding's account of the case had it), while she was whipped for fraud, does not seem to have been considered to have committed any sex crimes by either the courts or the press at the time. On the other hand, Terry Castle contends that English law in the eighteenth century ignored female homosexual activity not out of indifference, but out of male fears about acknowledging and reifying lesbianism. The literature of the time attempted to rationalise some women's lesbian activities, commonly searching for visible indications of sapphic tendencies. In The New Atlantis, for instance, the \\"real\\" lesbians are depicted as being masculine. However, Craft- Fairchild argues that Manley - along with Cleland in Fanny Hill - failed to establish a coherent narrative of lesbians as anatomically distinct from other women, while Fielding in The Female Husband instead focuses on the corruption of Hamilton's mind as leading to her homosexual acts and cross-dressing. This difficulty in establishing a narrative framework to fit female homosexuality into was acknowledged by Jonathan Swift in his writing for the Tatler in 1711, where he describes a woman having her virginity tested by a lion. Despite the onlookers' failure to see anything unusual about the woman, the lion identified her as \\"no true Virgin\\".Jonathan Swift. Tatler no. 5, 1711 At the same time, writings which were positive, or potentially positive, about female homosexuality, drew on the languages both of female same-sex friendship, and of heterosexual romance, as there were at the time no widespread cultural motifs of homosexuality. Only among the less respectable members of society does it seem that there was anything like a lesbian subculture. For instance, there was probably a lesbian subculture amongst dancers and prostitutes in eighteenth and early-nineteenth century Paris, and in eighteenth-century Amsterdam. Laws against lesbianism were suggested but usually not created or enforced in early American history. In 1636, John Cotton proposed a law for Massachusetts Bay making sex between two women (or two men) a capital offense, but the law was not enacted.Dorothy A. Mays Women in early America: struggle, survival, and freedom in a new world, ABC-CLIO, 2004 p. 232 It would have read, \\"Unnatural filthiness, to be punished with death, whether sodomy, which is carnal fellowship of man with man, or woman with woman, or buggery, which is carnal fellowship of man or woman with beasts or fowls.\\" In 1655, the Connecticut Colony passed a law against sodomy between women (as well as between men), but nothing came of this either.Foster, Thomas (2007). Long Before Stonewall: Histories of Same-Sex Sexuality in Early America. New York University Press. In 1779, Thomas Jefferson proposed a law stating that, \\"Whosoever shall be guilty of rape, polygamy, or sodomy with man or woman shall be punished, if a man, by castration, if a woman, by cutting thro' the cartilage of her nose a hole of one half inch diameter at the least\\",Amendment VIII: Thomas Jefferson, A Bill for Proportioning Crimes and Punishments. Press-pubs.uchicago.edu. Retrieved 2010-11-30. but this did not become law either. However, in 1649 in Plymouth Colony, Sarah White Norman and Mary Vincent Hammon were prosecuted for \\"lewd behavior with each other upon a bed\\"; their trial documents are the only known record of sex between female English colonists in North America in the 17th century.Kenneth Borris Same-sex desire in the English Renaissance: a sourcebook of texts, 1470–1650, Routledge, 2004 p. 113 Hammon was only admonished, perhaps because she was younger than sixteen, but in 1650 Norman was convicted and required to acknowledge publicly her \\"unchaste behavior\\" with Hammon, as well as warned against future offenses.Legal case: Norman, Hammon; Plymouth, March 6, 1649 . OutHistory (2008-07-15). Retrieved 2010-11-30. This is the only prosecution for female homosexual activities in United States history. In Paris in the late 19th and early 20th century, lesbians became more visible in art and in the public sphere. A painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec of entertainer Cha-U-Kao at the Moulin Rouge Close intimate relationships were common among women in the mid-19th century. This was attributed to strict gender roles that led women to expand their social circle to other women for emotional support. These relationships were expected to form close between women with similar socioeconomic status. Since there was not defined language in regards to lesbianism at the time, these relationships were seen to be homosocial. Though women developed very close emotional relationships with one another, marriage to men was still the norm. Yet there is evidence of possible sexual relationships to develop beyond an emotional level. Documents from two African-American women use terms describing practices known as \\"bosom sex.\\" While these women practiced heterosexuality with their husbands, it is still believed their relationship was romantic and sexual. Late 19th century and early 20th century saw the flourish of \\"Boston marriages\\" in New England. The term describes romantic friendship between two women, living together and without any financial support by men. Many lasting romantic friendships began at women's colleges. This kind of relationship actually predates New England's custom, there being examples of this in the United Kingdom and continental Europe since the 18th century. The late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw an increase in lesbian visibility in France, both in the public sphere and in representations of lesbians in art and literature. Fin de siecle society in Paris included bars, restaurants and cafes frequented and owned by lesbians, such as Le Hanneton and le Rat Mort, Private salons, like the one hosted by the American expatriate Nathalie Barney, drew lesbian and bisexual artists and writers of the era, including Romaine Brooks, Renee Vivien, Colette, Djuna Barnes, Gertrude Stein, and Radclyffe Hall. One of Barney's lovers, the courtesan Liane de Pougy, published a best-selling novel based on their romance called l'Idylle Saphique (1901). Many of the more visible lesbians and bisexual women were entertainers and actresses. Some, like the writer Colette and her lover Mathilde de Morny, performed lesbian theatrical scenes in cabarets that drew outrage and censorship. Descriptions of lesbian salons, cafes and restaurants were included in tourist guides and journalism of the era, as well as mention of houses of prostitution that were uniquely for lesbians. Toulouse Lautrec created paintings of many of the lesbians he met, some of whom frequented or worked at the famed Moulin Rouge.Nicole G Albert, \\"De la topographie invisible à l'espace public et littéraire :les lieux de plaisir lesbien dans le Paris de la Belle Époque\\" Revue d’histoire moderne et contemporaine 2006 /4 (no 53-4)Stéphanie Bee, Montmartre fin de siècle un repaire de lesbiennes, L'Univers, 1 November, 2010 Later 20th and early 21st centuries (1969–present) The Stonewall Riots were a series of spontaneous demonstrations, when members of the gay (i.e. LGBT) community fought back when police became violent during a police raid in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. The crowd was spurred to action when butch lesbian Stormé DeLarverie punched the police officer who had struck her over the head, and called out to the crowd, \\"Why don't you guys do something?\\"Yardley, William (May 29, 2014) \\"Storme DeLarverie, Early Leader in the Gay Rights Movement, Dies at 93\\" in The New York Times. These riots are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the gay liberation movement in the US, and one of the most important events in the modern fight for LGBT rights in the United States. Political lesbianism originated in the late 1960s among second wave radical feminists as a way to fight sexism and compulsory heterosexuality (see Adrienne Rich's essay Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence). Sheila Jeffreys, a lesbian, helped to develop the concept when she co-wrote \\"Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism\\" with the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group. They argued that women should abandon support of heterosexuality and stop sleeping with men, encouraging women to rid men \\"from your beds and your heads.\\" While the main idea of political lesbianism is to be separate from men, this does not necessarily mean that political lesbians have to sleep with women; some choose to be celibate or identify as asexual. The Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group definition of a political lesbian is \\"a woman identified woman who does not fuck men\\". They proclaimed men the enemy and women who were in relationships with them collaborators and complicit in their own oppression. Heterosexual behavior was seen as the basic unit of the patriarchy's political structure, with lesbians who reject heterosexual behavior therefore disrupting the established political system. Lesbian women who have identified themselves as \\"political lesbians\\" include Ti-Grace Atkinson, Julie Bindel, Charlotte Bunch, Yvonne Rainer, and Sheila Jeffreys. In 1974, Maureen Colquhoun came out as the first lesbian MP for the Labour Party in the UK. When elected she was in a heterosexual marriage. Lesbian feminism, which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s (primarily in North America and Western Europe), encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.Rich, A. (1980). \\"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\\". Signs; 5, 631–660. Some key thinkers and activists in lesbian feminism are Charlotte Bunch, Rita Mae Brown, Adrienne Rich, Audre Lorde, Marilyn Frye, Mary Daly, Sheila Jeffreys and Monique Wittig (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of queer theory). As with Gay Liberation, the lesbian feminist understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed \\"lesbian separatism\\", influenced by writings such as Jill Johnston's 1973 book Lesbian Nation. Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the lesbian sex wars,Lesbian Sex Wars , article by Elise Chenier from GLBTQ encyclopedia. clashing in particular over views on sadomasochism, prostitution and transgenderism.

The player must collect the ingredients and the correct spell word to cast a spell, which would allow the player to solve a puzzle (for example, a fish spell to turn into a fish and swim in water). Reception Slightly Magic received 94% in Your Sinclair magazine with the reviewer praising the graphics and music and claiming it was a better game than Dizzy.

Tempe House, designed by John Verge, has a Georgian feel and is regarded as one of the great houses of Sydney.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia Philanthropist Caroline Chisholm leased Tempe House as a boarding school for young women (1863–1865). The estate was known as Greenbank during this time and presented an ideal location for Chisholm's work. She remarked on the spacious and lofty rooms and the 'fine large and open orchard of fruit trees, intersected by wide and shady walks'. In 1884 the estate was sold to the Sisters of the Good Samaritan for use as a charitable refuge for women. The Sisters added the impressive St Magdalen's Chapel (1888), which is believed to be the work of Sheerin & Hennessy, an important firm of Sydney architects, who designed the Archbishop's Residence and St Patrick's College at Manly. The neo-Gothic style Chapel is of major cultural significance. It is now deconsecrated and has been restored as part of the Discovery Point redevelopment. Tempe House is now listed on the Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia, Macmillan Company, 1981, p.2/62 The area became predominantly industrial until a redevelopment was planned in the late 1990s. The new suburb was to be called North Arncliffe, but residents in the area petitioned the council to conduct a vote to select a better name. Wolli Creek was the most popular choice. Wolli Creek railway station opened in 2000. Wolli Creek was officially declared a suburb in 2002.Pictorial Memories ST GEORGE Rockdale, Kogarah, Hurstville, Compiled by Joan Lawrence, Kingsclear Books, Published in Australia  Heritage listings  Wolli Creek has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 1 Princes Highway: Tempe House and St Magdalenes Chapel Commercial/Retail area Restaurants and shops in the Village Square Once industrial, Wolli Creek was redeveloped in the 2010s into a high-density residential and commercial area.

The railway station is a stop on the scenic Cumbrian Coast Line south west of Carlisle. Some through trains to the Furness Line and from Sunderland stop here. The station is owned by Network Rail and managed by Northern who provide all passenger train services.  History and data  = History = Workington station, August 1983 The first Workington station on the Cumbrian Coast Line was built in the area known as Priestgate Marsh for the Whitehaven Junction Railway. Although the WJR was opened from Maryport to Workington in 1845 the WJR was advertising for tenders for building the station at Workington in October 1846.(advertisement): The WJR station had a single arrival and departure platform (the line was single until 1860) and no platform canopy \\"the platform is open to the prevailing winds, and \\" (we) \\" believe Workington is the only first-class station in Great Britain so unprovided with shelter\\" complained the Workington town trustees in 1858. In 1854 mis-set points led to a Maryport-Whitehaven goods train being routed into the end bay used by the Workington - Cockermouth trains: the goods train demolished the buffers and \\"dashed through\\" the booking office, the porter's office, and the gentleman's waiting room, carrying away the street wall of the station building, and finally coming to rest at the far wall of the ladies' waiting room. The booking office clerk having seen the train approaching, ensured no lives were lost but \\"the station\\" reported the Cumberland Pacquet \\"is of course a perfect wreck\\" and had to be re-built. (Immediately after the accident, the gas supply to the station was turned off at the meter, but it was noted that three gas lights continued to burn - the town trustees (who owned the town gasworks) declined to restore the supply until the WJR gave a satisfactory explanation or adequate compensation). The London & North Western Railway took over the Whitehaven Junction and Workington & Cockermouth lines in 1866, and replaced the WJR station. The LNWR station was extended further north than the WJR one, with its principal entrance now facing Station Road; a footpath through the goods yard was suppressed, and South Quay (linking the harbour with the town) was carried over the railway on a bridge, replacing a dangerous level crossing. At the height of railway development, two other stations served Workington: on the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, and on the Cleator and Workington Junction Railway. - both are now closed. The station on the coast line retained first claim on Workington, but after the opening of Workington Central could be distinguished from it by local papers as 'the Workington low railway station':e.g. it could be formally known as Workington LNWR (to distinguish it from Workington Central, Workington Bridge was also an LNWR station) or (post-grouping, when all three stations were LMS) as Workington Main; with the closure of the other stations it has reverted (both formally and informally) to being simply 'Workington' railway station. Trains from the Cockermouth and Keswick direction ended with the closure of that branch to all traffic in April 1966, the line having fallen victim to the Beeching Axe. A 1914 Railway Clearing House Junction Diagram showing the complex network which existed in the Workington area = Layout = The station was built with yellow Crewe bricks and had four tracks running through the station. Two of the tracks which are not served by platforms were once used to stable Travelling Post Office carriages. There was also a twelve road engine shed, wagon repair shops, a coaling stage, a goods shed and a stable block, all built with local sandstone. In LMS days, a new turntable was installed behind the engine shed. In British Railways days the engine shed was rebuilt with a new roof and ferro-concrete coaling stage and an ash disposal plant was built near to the new turntable. The road approach to the station entrance was remodelled in BR days when the highways near to the station were upgraded. Immediately adjacent to the southbound platform are two carriage sidings, used for stabling & servicing empty DMU sets overnight and at weekends. There is also a train crew depot here. = Facilities= The station is staffed throughout the week (closed in the evenings). There are waiting rooms and covered waiting areas on each platform, which are linked via footbridge. Step-free access is available to both platforms via ramps and a foot level crossing, though this is only open when station staff are present.Workington station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 2 December 2016 Outside these times, the only available access routes have steps. A P.A system and digital information screens provide train running information. = Temporary Workington North station = As a consequence of the November 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods, Network Rail built a temporary additional station from the existing station on waste ground off the A596 adjacent to a business park. An additional hourly shuttle train (composed of a locomotive and at least three former inter-city mainline coaches) operated by Cumbrian-based Direct Rail Services on behalf of Northern Rail, running from Workington northbound to Maryport was created in the aftermath of the floods. This service started on 30 November 2009 and ran until 28 May 2010. It was initially funded by the Department for Transport at a cost of £216,000. All services between Workington and Maryport were free of charge for this period.

A home made manual mitre sawing box. The most common form of a mitre box is a 3-sided box which is open at the top and the ends. The box is made wide enough to accommodate the width of the boards to be cut. Slots are cut in the walls of the box at the precise angle at which the cut is to be made. These slots provide the guide for the saw to follow. Most commonly, the slots in the mitre box are cut at 45 degrees and 90 degrees. The mitre saw combines the features of a mitre box with a backsaw. In the past, mitre boxes were constructed mostly of wood. Some have had metal guides fitted to reduce wear on the slots. Today, mitre boxes are also available in other materials such as moulded plastic and cast aluminium. When carpenters used to make their own mitre boxes, it was common to use a mitre box until its guide slots became worn and then make a new one out of scrap timber. There is still a case to be made for making one today; for example, if an odd size (say, 175 mm) cornice is to be fixed, then a custom mitre box with a bottom board that is 175 mm wide would ensure that the cornice sits true while the cuts are being made to it. The three pieces of timber that form the mitre box are nailed together, and the top steadying pieces are fixed with smaller panel pins. The angles are marked (at any angle, not necessarily 45 degrees) and the guide slots are cut with the same saw that will be used for the rest of the cutting. Use In use, the board to be cut is placed in the box and the point at which the board is to be cut is lined up with the appropriate slot in the mitre box wall. A backsaw was the most common kind of saw used for this operation, but any type of hand or power saw could be used if it fits in the slot openings. The cut is started by placing the saw blade in the slot and drawing the saw back and forth. The slot guides the cut all the way through so that the result is a cut that is perpendicular to the face or edge of the board (depending upon the desired orientation of the cut) and at the appropriate angle. For precise work, a board cut in a mitre box might then be further adjusted on a shooting board.

Course and features Wolli Creek rises south of Narwee, within Beverly Hills Park, Beverly Hills, and flows generally east northeast through Wolli Creek Valley and Wolli Creek Regional Park, joined by its major tributary, Bardwell Creek, before reaching its confluence with the Cooks River near Arncliffe and Tempe. The creek is a lined channel between Kingsgrove Road, Kingsgrove and Bexley Road, Bexley North where it then enters the Wolli Creek Valley. The sub- catchment area of the creek is . =Nature conservation value= Adjacent to Wolli Creek, within the Wolli Creek Valley, is Wolli Creek Regional Park, a planned nature reserve of native bushland and public reserves that was announced by the NSW Government in 1998 as a result of sustained community campaigning for the area to be preserved and for the M5 East Freeway to go underground. Whilst some of the park has been formed and management handed over from local government authorities to the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service, including the Girrahween Park and some privately held land that was compulsorily acquired, some areas of the originally planned park remain in the hands of government agencies including Sydney Water and Roads and Maritime Services. When complete, the planned nature reserve offers easy public transport access, family picnic areas, extensive views and bushland, rugged sandstone escarpments with walking tracks, a mixture of parkland, heathland, and woodland forest, and great birdwatching in close proximity to heavily developed residential and industrial landscape. Wildlife =Bird observation= The diversity of habitat and strategic location of the Wolli Creek Valley are reflected in the wide range of bird species to be found adjacent to the creek. Approximately 175 species of birds have been recorded in the area between 1940 and 1999. =Fish= Several species of freshwater and saltwater fish can be found in the Wolli Creek in areas above and below the fish ladder. The fish ladder, or \\"rock-ramp fishway\\" was constructed to enable fish to bypass the weir at Henderson St, Turrella, allowing migration to other areas of the creek. Coastal saltmarsh The lower reaches - the tidal part - of Wolli Creek are home to a plant community known as saltmarsh, or coastal saltmarsh. The plant community includes various salinity-tolerant species such as Knobby Club-rush (Ficinia nodosa), Samphire (Sarcocornia quinqueflora), Sea Rush (Juncus kraussii), Seablite (Suaeda australis), Streaked Arrowgrass (Triglochin striata) and others. Coastal saltmarsh has been recognised as a carbon sink as well as a filter of nutrients maintaining water quality and is listed as an Endangered Ecological Community under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the Privatisation of British Railways. The station signal box was the last surviving example built by the Maryport & Carlisle company prior to its closure and demolition in 1998. Facilities The station is unstaffed and has no ticket machine (though one is to be installed during 2019), so tickets must be purchased prior to travel or on the train (the main buildings are now in private residential use). Shelters are located on both platforms. Timetable posters, digital information screens and a telephone are provided to give train running information, whilst there is also public wifi access on offer. The platforms are linked by footbridge and there is step-free access to each one.Aspatria station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 20 December 2016 Service There is generally an hourly service northbound to and southbound to Whitehaven with most trains going onward to Barrow-in-Furness (no late evening service operates south of Whitehaven).GB eNRT December 2019 Edition, Table 100 In the current (winter 2019-20) timetable, all scheduled stops are now mandatory rather than on request.

His earliest performances were with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, first as a chorus member and then as a principal, creating the role of Private Willis in Iolanthe in 1882. After leaving D'Oyly Carte the following year, he sang with several opera companies, most notably the Carl Rosa Opera Company and Covent Garden. In 1898, he and his wife, the singer Fanny Moody, set up their own company, dedicated to presenting opera in English. The Moody-Manners company performed in London, the British provinces, North America and South Africa from 1898 to 1916. After his retirement, Manners continued to campaign for a national opera company, which was eventually founded forty years after his death.

The Times obituary (7 May 1935) also gives 1881 as the year in which he joined the company. Rollins and Witts, on the other hand, date his membership to 1882. In early 1882, he appeared on tour in the chorus of Claude Duval and, later in the same year, in the chorus of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance.Stone, David.

Among other roles, Manners played Devilshoof in The Bohemian Girl at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with Moody as Arline.The Era, 20 April 1895, p. 15 In 1896–97 he made a successful and remunerative tour of South Africa with Moody. When they returned to England in 1898, they formed the Moody-Manners Company. =Moody-Manners Opera Company= Manners's ambition was to found a company to give opera in English that would, in time, become a permanent national ensemble based in London.Rosenthal, Harold. \\"Moody-Manners Company\\", Oxford Music Online (requires subscription), accessed 26 December 2009 With limited capital at their disposal (Manners later stated that they founded the company on £1,700 borrowed from friends, and repaid it all within a year),Music & Letters, April 1926, p. 95 they began with a provincial tour, starting in Manchester in September 1898. The Manchester Guardian commented, \\"There can be no greater proof of the energy of Mr Manners as a director than the fact of his having produced during the second week of his career as a manager no fewer than seven different operas, two of which were absolute novelties in the provinces.\\" Of Manners himself, the paper wrote, \\"a highly gifted artist … whose voice seems to have lost none of the beauty which was so much admired in the far-away days when he was the Lifeguardsman in Iolanthe.\\"The Manchester Guardian, 19 September 1898, p. 5 Moody was the company's leading soprano.Warrack, \\"Moody, Fanny\\", p. 345 Manners circa 1900 By 1902 there were two Moody-Manners touring companies. The larger of the two had 175 members and gave London seasons in 1902 and 1903 at Covent Garden, in 1904 at Drury Lane, and in 1907 and 1908 at the Lyric Theatre when the repertoire included The Merry Wives of Windsor, The Marriage of Figaro, Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Faust, Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci, Madame Butterfly, Aïda and Il trovatore.The Musical Times, 1 August 1907, p. 542; and 1 September 1908, p. 600 There were Moody-Manners tours not only of Britain but also of North America and South Africa. The opera historian Harold Rosenthal wrote of the Moody-Manners company: \\"With the Carl Rosa company, it was the principal training ground for British artists in the years before World War I.\\" Manners held strong views about the training given by British music academies to young singers. In his view students were not equipped for a professional career because they were trained in the principal operatic roles rather than in the chorus parts, which almost all singers new to the profession would need to sing before being promoted to leading roles. He instanced his own early career: \\"I studied both at the Royal Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Academy, London, and then in Italy, and when I came back to London, all I could get was an engagement in comic opera where I sang for eighteen months before I could become a principal. It was not till over six years after I left my studies that I found anything I had learnt at the academies of any value to me.\\" Manners encouraged British composers to write for his company, offering prizes for the best operas:Warrack, \\"Manners, Charles\\", p. 313 one of the prize-winners was Colin McAlpin's The Cross and the Crescent (1903).Hubbard and Krehbiel, p. 348. Revival reviewed in The Era, 22 December 1915 He sponsored opera festivals in Sheffield in 1904 and 1906, whose profits helped to found Sheffield University. He also used profits from a successful season in Glasgow in 1906 to help create the Glasgow Grand Opera Society, which continued his work in popularising opera in English between the two World Wars. By 1910, Manners faced financial difficulties and had to disband one of his two companies, and the remaining Moody-Manners Company gave its last performance in May 1916. Manners retired from singing in 1913. In its final season, playing to capacity audiences, the Moody-Manners company offered Il trovatore, The Bohemian Girl, Martha, Faust, The Lily of Killarney, The Daughter of the Regiment, Carmen, and Eugene Onegin, with Moody as Tatiana.The Musical Times, 1 February 1916, p. 106 After the closure of his companies, Manners continued to campaign for a national opera company. He wrote to The Musical Times in 1921, \\"I here assert for the thousandth time that National Grand Opera can be given in an all round way at popular prices – I repeat, popular prices – far better than it has ever been given, without a cost of a farthing to the rates or taxes.\\"The Musical Times, 1 February 1921, p. 119 In 1926 he wrote a long article on \\"The Financial Problem of National Opera. By the People for the People\\", explaining his rationale.Music & Letters, April 1926, pp. 93–105 He disapproved of public subsidy, insisting that opera could be self-supporting and even profitable. Although later attempts to follow his precepts, such as those of Raymond Gubbay at the Savoy Theatre in 2004, have failed,Higgins, Charlotte. \\"After just one month, curtain falls on Savoy Opera – West End experiment to find wider audience flops\\", The Guardian, 8 May 2004, accessed 26 December 2009 his dream of a national opera company presenting operas in English has been realised. Manners and Moody retired to Ireland, where he died at Dundrum, County Dublin, aged 77. Notes References *Hubbard, W.L. and H.E. Krehbiel.

It is also known by the titles Cave Man, Man and His Mate, and Tumak. The film stars Victor Mature as protagonist Tumak, a young caveman who strives to unite the uncivilized Rock Tribe and the peaceful Shell Tribe, Carole Landis as Loana, daughter of the Shell Tribe chief and Tumak's love interest, and Lon Chaney Jr. as Tumak's stern father and leader of the Rock Tribe. Chaney's billing differs from that of his home studio Universal Pictures in that Hal Roach elected to retain the \\"Jr.\\" instead of billing him under his father's name, possibly because Roach was co-directing the film with his own son Hal Roach Jr.. The film was a popular success and was nominated for two Academy Awards for its special effects and musical score. Plot In a modern-day prologue, a group of hikers caught in a storm seek shelter in a cave. They encounter an anthropologist (Conrad Nagel) who interprets prehistoric carvings that introduce the story of a young caveman. Akhoba, head of the Rock Tribe, leads a hunting party. His son Tumak begs the right to his first kill, a small triceratops which he wrestles to death. An elderly man in the party falls from a cliff and is left to die. The party arrives at the Rock Tribe's cave with their prey. The beast is cooked on a fire. When it is done, the strongest feed first, next the women and children, then the few elderly pick the scraps. Tumak defends his portion from demands by Akhoba. They fight and Akhoba knocks Tumak over a cliff as his mother watches. Tumak recovers to find a mastodon attacking him. He runs and climbs a tree. The mastodon rams the tree and knocks it into a river. Tumak floats downstream unconscious and is found by Loana of the Shell Tribe. Her tribesmen answer her shell horn call and take Tumak to their cave. The tribe gathers for a meal of vegetables, shared orderly with the children, women and elderly served first. Tumak awakes and Loana gives him food, which he guards as he eats, perplexing the tribe who share and do not fight. Tumak looks on, confused by the customs of the Shell Tribe. Meanwhile, Akhoba leads a hunting party into the hills but is injured trying to take down a muskox. As Akhoba lies injured, a younger hunter asserts authority over the others and takes Akhoba's place as leader, leaving Akhoba to die. Later, Akhoba, crippled, shows up at the cave but is treated with contempt. Tumak adjusts slowly to life with the Shell Tribe. He helps the children gather food by shaking fruit out of a tree and they teach him how to laugh. He tries to fish with Loana but grows frustrated, as spearfishing is not like land hunting. While he is fishing, an Allosaurus traps a child in a tree. Tumak uses a borrowed spear to kill the animal and save the child, but does not want to return the spear to its owner. Later that night, Tumak steals the spear and a hammer from their maker, and attacks him when he tries to reclaim them. The tribal leader, Loana's father, banishes Tumak. As Tumak departs, Loana, who has fallen in love with him, leaves her tribe to follow him, much to his dismay. Tumak pulls apples from a tree for himself, ignoring Loana. Seeing that she has trouble reaching apples herself, he relents and helps her. Along the way, they spot an armored creature (similar to a glyptodont) which chases them up a tree. Later, as Tumak and Loana reach Rock Tribe territory, they are trapped in a fissure during a fight between a dimetrodon and a lizard-like dinosaur. Loana escapes, but is menaced by the leader who previously displaced Akhoba. She blows her shell horn, leading Tumak to her rescue. He saves her by defeating the leader and becomes the new leader. Tumak has Loana handle the meals, which confuses the Rock Tribe, since she feeds the women and children first, then Akhoba whom she has sat on his former throne, and then the other elders. Lastly, Tumak and the able-bodied men are fed. The next day, Akhoba comes outside to see his tribe learning to gather fruits and vegetables, with Loana showing them which are good to eat and which are not. Loana and Tumak sit and talk, but Tumak is called away to help hunt a deer while Loana helps search for a missing child. A nearby volcano erupts, scattering the Rock Tribe and destroying their cave. A child's mother is engulfed by a lava flow to death; Loana saves the child but is cut off from the others by the lava flow. She and the child head to the Shell Tribe. Many animals fall into the crevasses opened by the eruption. Tumak searches for Loana but finds only a scrap of her clothing near the lava flow and presumes her to be dead. Later, a Shell tribesman seeks out Tumak and tells him that Loana is still alive, but the Shell Tribe is trapped in their cave by a large Monitor lizard-like dinosaur. Tumak leads his men to attack and kill the animal. Akohba and the women with the children follow. The Shell Tribe hold off the beast with torches. Tumak's direct spear attack is futile. Akhoba advises Tumak to distract the dinosaur while the rest of the men climb to higher ground. They start a rockslide that kills the beast. The formerly despised Akhoba becomes recognized for his experience and wisdom. The two tribes unite as one. Tumak, Loana, and the rescued child are framed in the dawn of a new day.

W. Griffith to produce this film and Of Mice and Men, writing to him, \\"I need help from the production side to select the proper writers, cast, etc. and to help me generally in the supervision of these pictures.\\"Ward, Richard Lewis (2005) A History of the Hal Roach Studios, p. 109-110. Southern Illinois University. . In his Biograph days, Griffith had directed two films with prehistoric settings: Man's Genesis (1912), and Brute Force (1913). Griffith reportedly wrote a script based on a French novel by Eugene Roche. Although Griffith eventually disagreed with Roach over the production and parted, Roach later insisted that some of the scenes in the completed film were directed by Griffith. This would make the film the final production in which Griffith was actively involved. But cast members recall Griffith directing only the screen tests and costume tests. When Roach advertised the film in late 1939 with Griffith listed as producer, Griffith asked that his name be removed. Victor Mature had just made his film debut in Hal Roach's The Housekeeper's Daughter. Roach had signed him to a seven-year contract. \\"Griffith did all the tests\\", recalled Mature. \\"He tested for six months. I don't know what he was looking for. They'd have been better off letting the old man direct the picture. One day he just wasn't around any more.\\" Lon Chaney Jr. had just made Of Mice and Men for Roach. \\"I had to 'ugh' my way through that picture\\", said Mature. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Musical Score and Best Special Effects (Roy Seawright, Elmer Raguse). The \\"dinosaurs\\" seen in the film include a pig in a rubber Triceratops suit, a man in an Allosaurus suit, elephants with fake tusks and fur, an armadillo with glued-on horns, a baby alligator with a glued-on Dimetrodon sail (Gatorsaurus), a rhinoceros iguana, a snake, a coati, a monitor lizard and an Argentine black and white tegu. Reception The film drew mixed reviews from critics. B. R. Crisler of The New York Times called the film \\"a masterpiece of imaginative fiction ... You are almost certain to like something about 'One Million, B. C.'\\" Variety called it \\"corny\\", adding, \\"There isn't much sense to the action nor much interest in the characters.\\" Harrison's Reports praised the \\"good technical work\\" and called the volcanic eruption \\"most thrilling\\", but said the storyline and romance were \\"slightly silly, and only tend to bore one.\\" Film Daily called the film a \\"decided novelty\\" that was \\"full of thrills\\" and had \\"excellent\\" direction. John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote, \\"Being skimpy with its dinosaurs, 'One Million B.C.' won't tickle the gizzards of paleontologists.\\" Legacy Footage from this film, as well as numerous unused scenes and outtakes, went into a stock footage library. This footage was then used by numerous companies through the years by producers who wanted to save money on costly effects shots in special effects films that featured dinosaurs. As well, even a few Westerns used footage of rockslides and volcanoes from this film too. Because of this, footage from this film appeared in numerous films throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. These films include: Tarzan's Desert Mystery (1943), one of the chapters of the serial Superman (1948), Atom Man vs. Superman (1950), Two Lost Worlds (1950), The Lost Volcano (1950; the Bomba, the Jungle Boy series), the American version of Godzilla Raids Again, Jungle Manhunt (1951; the Jungle Jim series), Smoky Canyon (1952), the \\"Yesterday's World\\" episode of The Schaefer Century Theatre (1952), Untamed Women (1952), Robot Monster (1953), The Lost Planet (1953), King Dinosaur (1955), the Three Stooges short Space Ship Sappy (1957), Teenage Caveman (1958), She Demons (1958), Valley of the Dragons (1961), Journey to the Center of Time (1967), Horror of the Blood Monsters (1970; the stock footage was tinted in color for this film), the Mexican films Island of the Dinosaurs ('La isla de los dinosaurios\\" 1967), Adventure at the Center of the Earth (\\"Aventura al centro de la tierra\\"; 1966), and The Ghost Jesters (\\"Los fantasmas burlones\\"; 1964), One Million AC/DC (1970), TerrorVision, and Attack of the B Movie Monster (1989).Van Hise, James (2002) Hot Blooded Dinosaur Movies, Pioneer Books Inc, 1993. p. 20Berry, Mark F. The Dinosaur Filmography, McFarland & CompanyGlut, Donald F. (1982) The Dinosaur Scrapbook, Citadel Press The technique of using optically enlarged lizards to represent dinosaurs has been given the nickname of \\"slurpasaur\\" by fans. The film was remade as One Million Years B.C. (1966) starring John Richardson as Tumak and Raquel Welch as Loana. The external scenes were filmed in the Canary Islands. The film features several scenes of animal cruelty, including a baby alligator with a costume glued to it made to fight against a tegu lizard, which is severely injured. This film caused the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) to ban many of the animal treatments that occurred during the production. The film has been colorized.

Until converting from Judaism to Catholicism in February 1945, Zolli was the chief rabbi in Rome, Italy's Jewish community from 1940 to 1945. After the war, he taught philosophy at a number of institutions throughout Rome including the Sapienza University of Rome and Pontifical Biblical Institute. Zolli is noted for his admiration of Pope Pius XII during World War II, who gave support and shelter to Zolli and other Jews during Nazi Germany's occupation of Italy from 1943 to 1944. It was later revealed that Zolli hid in a number of places in both Rome and Vatican City State. Early years/rabbinate Zoller was born in 1881 the city of Brody in then-Austria-Hungary, which from 1918 to 1945 was in eastern Poland, and currently is in western Ukraine. He was the youngest of five children, with three brothers and a sister. Zoller's father was a formerly wealthy factory owner, and his mother came from a family dynasty of rabbis. He earned a doctorate degree in philosophy from the University of Florence in Italy. At the same time, he prepared for the rabbinate at a nearby yeshiva. In 1917, Zoller's first wife, Adele, died. In 1920, he married his second wife, Eva Majonica. She was born in the town of Gorizia, in northeast Italy. In 1918, he was appointed rabbi of the Italian city of Trieste whose territory had just been transferred from Austria-Hungary to Italy. He changed his surname to \\"Zolli\\" to make it sound more Italian. Italian fascist leaders began excluding Italian Jews from social welfare programs including financial support and schooling throughout the 1930s and denigrated them in the press. A vicious press campaign by the fascists forced out the Chief Rabbi of Rome, Davide Prato. In December 1939, Zolli was named as chief rabbi of Rome with the support of fascist leaders. Zolli had conflict with his congregants in Rome from the start. Zolli's presiding style in delivering the liturgy was more casual than they preferred, and he was more interested in academic inquiry than pastoral work or community leadership. There were disputes over salary and expectations. During this time, Zolli formed a friendship with Jesuit scholar Augustin Bea. Holocaust of Rome: 1943–1944 After Zolli moved to Rome in 1940, he attempted to convince Ugo Foa, President of the Jewish Community in Rome, and Dante Almansi, President of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, that German Nazis were a significant threat to the Roman Jewish community. According to American researcher, Daniel T. Murphy, Zolli \\"recommended the total suppression of public Jewish functions, the closing of administrative offices, the elimination of donor lists, the dispersion of all members of the Jewish community, the distribution of financial aid, and the reduction of the community treasury.\\" In the next few years, as the Nazis swept over Europe during World War II, all three of Zolli's brothers were killed in The Holocaust. In 1944, after Zolli emerged from hiding in the house of Amadeo Pierantoni, a Catholic member of Rome's anti-fascist resistance party, Giustizia e Libertà, his position as chief rabbi was restored by Charles Poletti, although the Jewish community rebuffed him, as seen in Rabbi Louis Israel Newman's book, A Chief Rabbi of Rome becomes a Catholic. Zolli later described his wartime experiences as follows: Conversion to Christianity In his autobiography, Before the Dawn: Autobiographical Reflections by Eugenio Zolli, Former Chief Rabbi of Rome, Zolli said that while presiding over the religious service in the synagogue on the holy day of Yom Kippur in 1944, he experienced a vision of Jesus. Within his heart, he says, he found the words \\"You are here for the last time.\\" On 13 February 1945, Zolli, his second wife, and daughter converted to Catholicism (his first wife having died years earlier). He was baptized at Gregorian University by Mgr. Luigi Traglia in the presence of Father Paolo Dezza; his godfather was Father Augustin Bea, confessor of Pope Pius XII. Zolli chose to be christened \\"Eugenio Maria\\" in homage to Pope Pius XII, who was born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli. After his conversion, Zolli was asked in an interview why he had \\"given up the Synagogue for the Church.\\" Zolli responded saying, \\"But I have not given it up. Christianity is the completion or crown of the Synagogue. For, the Synagogue was a promise, and Christianity is the fulfillment of that promise. The Synagogue pointed to Christianity: Christianity presupposes the Synagogue. So you see, one cannot exist without the other. What I converted to was the living Christianity.\\"Introduction to Before the Dawn by A.B. Klyber. pg. 17 Later years and death After Zolli and his wife converted to Catholicism, he was employed at the Sapienza University of Rome and Pontifical Biblical Institute. In 1956, he became seriously ill and entered the hospital where he reportedly revealed to a nun that he would die on the first Friday of the month at 3:00 in the afternoon. On 2 March 1956, Zolli received Holy Communion in the morning, eventually drifted into coma, and died as he predicted at 3:00 P.M. on the first Friday of the month. He was 74. He is buried at Campo Verano cemetery in Rome, Italy.  Reception and legacy  After the controversy surrounding his conversion settled, Zolli's life and writings did not achieve widespread attention. His life and work were neglected, except for debate over Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust which arose in the 1960s. He continued to be forgotten until his autobiography was republished in Italian in 2004 and became a bestseller. This spurred a new body of scholarship on his life. Quotations *\\"Conversion consists in responding to a call from God. A man is not converted at the time he chooses, but at the hour when he receives God's call. When the call is heard, he who receives it has only one thing to do: obey. Paul is 'converted'. Did he abandon the God of Israel? Did he cease to love Israel? It would be absurd to think so. But then? The convert is one who feels impelled by an irresistible force to leave a pre-established order and seek his own proper way. It would be easier to continue along the road he was on.\\" quoted in *\\"In the Old Testament, Justice is carried out by one man towards another...We do good for good received; we do harm for harm we have suffered at the hands of another. Not to do injury for injury is, in a certain fashion, to fall short of justice. What a contrast with the Gospel: Love your enemies...pray for them, or even Jesus' last words on the cross: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing!' All this stupefied me. The New Testament is, in fact, an altogether new Covenant\\".

He became famous for the invention of the wood gas generator.  Early life  On March 26, 1884 Imbert was born in Niederstinzel, France, a small town about ten kilometers from Sarre-Union. He was the oldest of four children. After primary school in Diemeringen, he attended Sarreguemines High School. Because of his academic success, his father enrolled him at the School of Chemistry Mulhouse, which at that time was one of the most famous in Europe. Three years later Imbert acquired a degree in chemical engineering; his interest in the subject led him to pursue his own research further. At the age of 20 he filed his first patent. Over the next ten years he developed various industrial processes and filed several additional patents for them. In 1908 he opened a soap factory in Diemeringen where he applied many of the industrial processes he had patented. He also worked as a research scientist in Manchester. From 1915 to 1918 Imbert was enlisted in the German army where he worked as a chemist in the factory \\"Königswarter and Ebell\\" in Linden and in the factory \\"Pintsch\\" in Berlin. After he was demobilized in 1918, Imbert produced soap at the mill in Diemeringen.  Invention of the wood gas generator  At the same time Georges Imbert embarked on experiments to transform coal into liquid fuel. He even managed to make synthetic gasoline, which unfortunately was too expensive. By then he had abandoned the liquid fuel solution and became interested in gas generators. In the early 1920s he created a generator that utilized charcoal. In 1921 Imbert built a charcoal gasifier and two years later he succeeded in gasification for a vehicle. In 1923, the Army, informed by De Dietrich of the invention, asked Imbert to build a wood gasifier for the French Government. At Sarre-Union, rue de Bitche, the hat manufacturer, where Imbert set up his gas-fired plant (1925) at Reichshoffen, De Dietrich, which has the industrial capacity in metallurgy and the automobile, set up a workshop for him. In 1925, he patented various processes on gas generators. De Dietrich, for their part also filed a patent on gasogens, which pushed Imbert to end this partnership in 1926. After buying the \\"Chalet\\", a beautiful home in Sarre-Union, he created the Compagnie Générale des Gazogens Imbert in 1930. Despite the enthusiasm of André Maginot, Minister of War, the gasifier struggled to break through in France. In 1931, Georges Imbert was forced to sell some of his licenses to his representative in Germany. In 1934, his brother Jean-Paul, tried to sell gasogen to the United States. The success in Germany allowed Imbert to continue developing his technique in Sarre-Union. He was developing a gasifier that could use green wood without clogging the engine. During the evacuation of Sarre-Union in May 1940, he moved with his family to Epinal in the Vosges. On his return in September of the same year, he returned to work by becoming an employee of his former company bought by \\"Imbert Köln\\". The recognition of Georges Imbert's work in 1944 by all the European manufacturers marks the celebration of the life of the chemical engineer. The German press called him the \\"pope\\" of the gasifier. Germany used the wood gasifier in all military operations on tanks, armored cars and ammunition trucks.  End of life  Having lost a son on the Russian front and feeling responsible, Imbert became an alcoholic. In December 1944, Sarre- Union was released by the Americans. Georges Imbert was not imprisoned because he was employed by the Germans. On the other hand, in 1945 his property was sequestrated and sold as war damage. Imbert lost interest in everything and died a few years later, in 1950, at the age of 65.

Eisenhower on July 7, 1958, allowing Alaska to become the 49th U.S. state on January 3, 1959. History From 1867 to 1884, Alaska was considered to be a military district of the United States under the control of the federal government, known as the Department of Alaska. From 1884 to 1912, it was designated as the District of Alaska, and from 1912 to 1959, was organized into the incorporated Territory of Alaska. Alaskans had sought statehood since as early as the 1920s, though this vision was not realized until the decade after World War II. =The First Organic Act= In 1884, the Department of Alaska was organized into the District of Alaska, when Congress passed the Organic Act allowing for Alaska to become a judicial district as well as a civil one, with judges, clerks, marshals, and limited government officials appointed by the federal government to run the territory. Furthermore, during the 1896–1910 gold rush eras (Klondike, Nome, and Fairbanks), hundreds of thousands of people traveled to Alaska in search for gold. Several industries flourished as a result, such as fishing, trapping, mining and mineral production. Alaska's resources were depleted to the extent that it came to be considered a \\"colonial economy\\". Alaska was still just a district, however, and the local government had little control over local affairs. =The Second Organic Act= Several issues arose that made it more difficult for Alaska to push towards self-government. One of these was the formation of the \\"Alaska Syndicate\\" in 1906 by the two barons J. P. Morgan and Simon Guggenheim. Their influence spread and they came to control the Kennecott copper mine, steamship and railroad companies, and salmon packing. The influence of the Syndicate in Washington D.C. opposed any further movement towards Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, however, grew increasingly concerned over the exploitation of Alaska for personal and corporate interests and took it upon himself to fight for Alaskan self-rule. He used the Ballinger–Pinchot affair in order to help achieve this. As a result of the affair, Alaska was on the national headlines, and President William Howard Taft was forced to send a message to Congress on February 2, 1912, insisting that they listen to Wickersham. In August 1912 Congress passed the Second Organic Act, which established the Territory of Alaska with a capital at Juneau and an elected legislature.An Act to create a legislative assembly in the Territory of Alaska, to confer legislative power thereon, and for other purposes, 62nd Congress, 2nd Session, ch. 387 (Public Law No. 334), 37 Stat. 512 (August 24, 1912). The federal government still retained much of the control over laws regarding fishing, gaming, and natural resources and the governor was also still appointed by the President. In 1916, Wickersham, who was now a delegate to Congress, proposed the first bill for Alaskan statehood. The bill, however, failed, partly due to lack of interest among Alaskans in gaining statehood. =National and Congressional discrimination= Discrimination against the Alaskan Territory made it difficult for Congress to get much done. Discussion of revising the Second Organic Act took up much time but came to no avail. Instead, Congress passed the Jones Act (also known as the Merchant Marine Act of 1920) and the White Act of 1924 both of which made the fishing problem worse for Alaskans rather than better. Alaskans were angered by these two acts and felt they were discriminatory. Matters were made worse by regional conflicts which drew attention away from the issue of statehood. In the 1930s, Alaska was plagued by the Depression. During this time, President Franklin D. Roosevelt did two significant things for Alaska. First, he allowed for 1,000 selected farmers hurt by the depression to move to Alaska and colonize the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, being given a second chance at agricultural success. Second and more importantly, Roosevelt appointed Ernest Gruening as governor of Alaska in 1939. Edward Lewis \\"Bob\\" Bartlett, who was one of Alaska's territorial delegates to Congress from 1944 to 1958 when he became a U.S. senator representing Alaska, would become one of Gruening's most important allies in supporting the cause for Alaskan statehood. =Breaking down the barriers toward statehood= Alaska's desire for statehood was much aided by the amount of attention it received during World War II. After Japan initiated the Aleutian Islands Campaign in June 1942, the territory became an important strategic military base and a key to the Pacific during the war, and its population increased with the number of American servicemen sent there. It remained critically important in deterring Soviet aggression through the Bering Strait during the Cold War. However, many barriers still stood between Alaska and statehood. Many Alaskans, like the Lomen brothers of Nome and Austin E. \\"Cap\\" Lathrop, who benefited largely from Alaska's small tax base, did not want themselves or their businesses to be hurt financially by the increase in taxes that would result from statehood. Other Alaskans feared that statehood would result in a flood of more people coming to Alaska, which they didn't want. There was enough of a majority, though, that did want statehood so as to be able to pass a referendum for statehood in Alaska in 1946 by a 3:2 vote. =The opposition= With the help of the referendum, Bartlett was able to introduce a bill to Congress. The bill, however, was immediately shot down by a coalition of Democrats and Republicans. (Republicans feared that Alaska would be unable to raise enough taxes due to its small population, and end up as a welfare state. The Southern Democrats feared more pro-civil rights congressmen.) To retaliate, Gruening established the \\"Alaska Statehood Committee\\" in 1949. He encouraged journalists, newspaper editors, politicians, and members of national and labor organizations to help use their positions and power to make the issue of Alaskan statehood more known. He gathered a group of 100 prominent figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, actor James Cagney, writers Pearl S. Buck and John Gunther, historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr, and theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, who all stood for the Alaskan cause. Another bill was introduced to Congress in 1949 and passed in the House by a 186 to 146 vote in 1950. However, the bill was then shot down in the Senate, again for fear of adding more Democrats to the 81st Congress (1949–1951) Democratic (54 seats) Republican (42 seats). On February 27, 1952, the Senate by a one-vote margin (45-44) killed the statehood bill for another year. Southern Democrats had threatened a filibuster to delay consideration. In the 1954 State of the Union address, Eisenhower referred to statehood for Hawaii (then a Republican territory) but not Alaska (then a Democratic territory). By March, frustrated by Eisenhower's refusal to support statehood for Alaska, a Senate coalition led by Democrats tied the fates of Alaska and Hawaii statehood together as one package. The procedural move was backed by some Southern Democrats, concerned about the addition of new votes in the civil rights for blacks movement, in the hope of defeating both measures. =Increasing public interest= Six members of the Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, including Senator Butler, went to Alaska in order to hold public hearings and see for themselves what the public sentiment was in Alaska. In response to the visit, Alaskans would not let Americans forget the cause. Citizens sent Christmas cards reading \\"Make [Alaskans'] future bright/Ask your Senator for statehood/And start the New Year right.\\" Women made bouquets of Alaska's flower, the Forget-Me-Not and sent them to members of Congress. Movements such as \\"Operation Statehood\\" also put increasing pressure on Congress. \\"Lack of public interest\\" could no longer be used as a feasible excuse to prevent statehood. In 1954 territorial governor B. Frank Heintzleman proposed that Alaska be divided at the 156th meridian west. Most Alaskans opposed his proposal. Gruening and the Constitutional Convention In interest of the growing fervor and enthusiasm towards the cause, a Constitutional Convention was held at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks in 1955. During this convention, Gruening gave a very powerful speech which compared Alaska's situation to the American struggle for independence. The famous speech was entitled \\"Let Us End American Colonialism\\" and had a very influential impact. The convention was highly praised and very emotional. The Constitution for Alaska was written up and Alaskans voted and passed the Alaska Constitution in 1956 with overwhelming approval. The Constitution was named \\"one of the best, if not the best, state constitutions ever written\\" by the National Municipal League. The Tennessee Plan Another step forward for the cause was taken by the Alaskan adoption of the \\"Tennessee Plan\\" which allowed them to elect their delegates to Congress without having to wait for an official act from Congress. Alaskans therefore elected to Congress Senators Ernest Gruening and William A. Egan and Representative to the House Ralph J. Rivers. Gruening, Egan, and Rivers attended Congress and were politely received, though they were not officially seated or recognized in any way. The Alaskan delegation did not give up, however, and worked hard with Bartlett to pressure the Congress into action. Members of Congress finally change their minds Eventually, with the help of Bartlett's influence, the Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, who until 1957 had been an ardent opponent of the Alaskan statehood cause, changed his mind and when Congress reconvened in January 1958, President Eisenhower fully endorsed the bill for the first time. Senator Lyndon B. Johnson promised his commitment to the bill but others still stood in the way, such as Representative Howard W. Smith of Virginia, Chairman of the powerful Rules Committee, and Thomas Pelly of Washington State who wanted the Alaskan waters to be open to use by Washingtonians. Eventually, though, such resistance was able to be bypassed and the House passed the statehood bill. The Senate, which had had its own version of the bill as well as the House's version, finally managed to pass the House's bill through the fervent urging of Bartlett by a 64–20 vote. On January 3, 1959, after much struggle and through the efforts of many, Alaska finally became the 49th state of the United States of America after President Eisenhower's signing of the official declaration. August 26, 1958 ballots Three propositions had to be passed by Alaskans in order for statehood to happen: #\\"Shall Alaska immediately be admitted into the Union as a State?\\" #\\"The boundaries of the State of Alaska shall be as prescribed in the Act of Congress approved July 7, 1958 and all claims of this State to any areas of land or sea outside the boundaries so prescribed are hereby irrevocably relinquished to the United States.\\" #\\"All provisions of the Act of Congress approved July 7, 1958 reserving rights or powers to the United States, as well as those prescribing the terms or conditions of the grants of lands or other property therein made to the State of Alaska, are consented to fully by said State and its people.\\" All three propositions were approved by Alaskans in a special election held on August 26, 1958. Voter turnout was high. Civil rights, Alaska, and Hawaii In the late 1950s civil rights bills were being introduced in Congress. To overcome the Southern Democrats' suppression of the pro-Republican African- American vote, then-Republican Hawaii's prospects for statehood were tied to Alaska's, which many thought would be more Democratic. Hawaii statehood was expected to result in the addition of two pro-civil-rights senators from a state which would be the first to have majority non-white population.

It is also the capital of the Kingdom of Bonny. Traditionally (especially between the 15th and 19th centuries) it was a major trading post of the eastern delta. Bonny Island is a major export point for oil. The region produces a type of crude oil known as Bonny Light oil. Much of the oil extracted onshore in Rivers State is piped to Bonny for export. It has the biggest LNG Gas Plant in Nigeria with six (6) trains. Kingdom of Bonny The Kingdom of Bonny was a sovereign state in the Niger Delta. The kingdom, comprising virgin lands and territorial areas, was founded before or about AD 1400. The founding group of the kingdom, who originated within the Isedani lineage of Kolokuma in the Ebeni-toru region (which is itself in the present day Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of Bayelsa State), was led by four direct descendants of Ebeni. These were Ndoli, Opuamakuba, Alagbariye and Asimini. From these leaders and the entire founding generation of the kingdom evolved the lineage/ward/house system of governance that is currently used to administer the state. The“Amanyanabo”, or monarch (lit. owner of the land);), presided over a chieftaincy system composed of the \\"Ase-Alapu\\" (or high chiefs of royal blood) and the “Amadapu” (or district heads). The four descendants of Ebeni became monarchs of the kingdom in turn, and are remembered today as its founding fathers. After their deaths, their own descendants ruled the kingdom as kings until the reign of King Awusa (alias Halliday) in the early modern era. It was after King Awusa Halliday, the twelfth king of the Bonny kingdom, that King Perekule I succeeded to the kingship. Since his reign, King Perekule's direct descendants have served as successors to the throne established by the founding generation of Bonny. The Kingdom of Bonny was powerful beginning in the 15th century with the advent of the Portuguese and the following Atlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, it came under increasing pressure from the British to end the trade. It collapsed in the subsequent Bonny civil war of 1869. A remnant of it continues to exist as a part of the contemporary aristocratic structure of Nigeria. the people of Bonny are still in existence and the town is still occupy with people of different tribes.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 1993. In the episode, Marge is arrested for shoplifting after forgetting to pay for an item at the Kwik-E-Mart. The family hires attorney Lionel Hutz to defend her at trial, but she is found guilty and sentenced to 30 days imprisonment. Homer, and the rest of the family have trouble coping without Marge. The townspeople start a riot when an annual bake sale missing Marge fails to raise enough money for a statue of Abraham Lincoln and they have to settle for a statue of Jimmy Carter. Mayor Quimby has Marge released from jail in order to save his career and quell the riot. The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Jim Reardon. After its initial airing on Fox, the episode was later included as part of a 1997 video release titled The Simpsons: Crime and Punishment. It was released again on the 2005 edition of the same set. The episode is included on The Simpsons – The Complete Fourth Season DVD box set released on June 15, 2004. \\"Marge in Chains\\" received a positive reception from television critics. A quote by Lionel Hutz from the episode was included in The News Tribune's \\"Eight Great 'Simpsons' Quotes\\". The authors of I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide commented positively on the episode, as did reviews in The Daily Mirror and The Observer. Plot Many of Springfield's residents purchase \\"Juice Looseners\\" through the mail, which are inefficient and loud juicers built in Osaka and shipped from there. One of the assembly line workers has the flu and coughs into the box destined for Homer, filling it with airborne germs. When the Juice Looseners arrive in Springfield, the Osaka Flu hits the town and many of the townspeople are affected by the illness. Due to exhaustion from having to look after the rest of her ill family, Marge accidentally forgets to pay for Grampa's bottle of bourbon when shopping at the Kwik-E-Mart. She is then arrested for shoplifting. Chief Wiggum tells Mayor Quimby about the arrest in confidence, and Mayor Quimby later reveals this fact to everyone in town during a public address. Marge's reputation is lowered dramatically among the townspeople, who now distrust her around their possessions. The family hires Lionel Hutz to defend Marge at her trial, but Hutz loses the case and the jury finds Marge guilty. She is sentenced to 30 days imprisonment at Springfield Women's Prison. Marge's absence is felt at home as Homer and the rest of the family struggles to cope without her. The annual bake sale also suffers – without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln; they instead purchase a statue of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. They then unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it. The last scene shows Bart and Lisa playing on the statue, which has been converted into a tether ball post. Production alt=A portrait of a man with black hair looking at the viewer \\"Marge in Chains\\" was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein and was the first episode that they wrote as staff writers. The script was assigned to them after somebody else had come up with the idea. The first draft of the script was \\"slightly more realistic\\" than the final version of the episode because Oakley and Weinstein had done a lot of research about women in prison, much of which was later replaced. For Apu and Sanjay's brief lines of Indian dialogue, the writers called the Embassy of India in Washington to get them to translate. The Embassy was not \\"interested or happy\\" but still did it.Oakley, Bill. (2004). DVD Commentary for \\"Marge in Chains\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the episode, Jimmy Carter is referred to as \\"history's greatest monster\\".Jean, Al. (2004). DVD Commentary for \\"Marge in Chains\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In the 2004 Season 4 DVD commentary for this episode, show runners Mike Reiss and Al Jean reveal that they did not like Carter, although they would vote for him ahead of George W. Bush. Kwik-E-Mart operator Apu testifies in a courtroom scene in the episode that he is able to recite 40,000 decimal places of the number pi. He correctly notes that the 40,000th digit is the number one. The episode's writers prepared for this scene by asking David H. Bailey of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (now at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) for the number of the 40,000th decimal place of pi. Bailey sent them back a printout of the first 40,000 digits. The Troy McClure movie title P is for Psycho is Mike Reiss' favorite joke he ever wrote for The Simpsons. \\"Marge in Chains\\" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 6, 1993. The episode was selected for release in a 1997 video collection of selected episodes titled: The Simpsons: Crime and Punishment. Other episodes included in the set were \\"Homer the Vigilante\\", \\"Bart the Fink\\", and \\"You Only Move Twice\\". It was included again in the 2005 DVD release of the Crime and Punishment set. \\"Marge in Chains\\" is also featured on The Simpsons' season 4 DVD set, The Simpsons – The Complete Fourth Season, which was released on June 15, 2004. Cultural references David Crosby portrays himself in a cameo appearance in the episode as the 12-step sponsor for Lionel Hutz. The classic Crosby, Stills, and Nash song \\"Teach Your Children\\" is referenced when Crosby tells Hutz on the phone, \\"and know that I love you.\\" During Marge's trial for shoplifting, prosecutors show the Zapruder film and assert that Marge was present on the grassy knoll when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. The scene where Maude Flanders peers through a hole in a wall at Marge is a reference to the 1960 film Psycho. In Lionel Hutz's dream of what the world would be like without lawyers, the writers had wanted to use the song \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\", which was used in Coca-Cola advertisements, but they could not get the rights to it. Instead, they used a similar instrumental theme. The episode's title is a reference to the Seattle grunge band Alice in Chains, which at the time of this episode had aired received mainstream success and popularity. Homer also complains in the episode that \\"[he'll] miss Sheriff Lobo\\". =Coronavirus \\"prediction\\"= During the COVID-19 pandemic, media outlets reported that The Simpsons had \\"predicted\\" the outbreak with this episode. Episode writer Bill Oakley criticized Internet trolls for using the episode for \\"nefarious purposes\\", including creating memes replacing \\"Osaka flu\\" with \\"coronavirus.\\" Oakley stated his reference for the \\"Osaka\\" plot device was the 1968 flu pandemic which began in British Hong Kong, stating it was \\"just supposed to be a quick joke about how the flu got here.\\" When speaking on \\"predictions\\" from The Simpsons in general, Oakley continued \\"It's mainly just coincidence because the episodes are so old that history repeats itself.\\" Comparisons to the episode experienced a resurgence in May 2020, following advisories by Washington state regarding Asian giant hornets in the region, citing a scene where an angry crowd tips over a truck they believed contained a \\"placebo\\" for Osaka flu, and accidentally unleashing a swarm of killer bees from a crate in the process. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Marge in Chains\\" finished 31st in ratings for the week of May 3–9, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 11.1, equivalent to approximately 10.3 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following Beverly Hills, 90210. In a review of the episode in The Observer, Caroline Boucher wrote: \\"My domestic Simpsons correspondent, Simon, reports a particularly fine episode, Marge in Chains to the extent that he watched the tape twice.\\" Karl French of Financial Times characterized the plot of the episode as a \\"modern version\\" of It's a Wonderful Life. Dusty Lane of The News Tribune cited a quote from Lionel Hutz in the episode among his list of \\"Eight Great 'Simpsons' Quotes\\" – \\"Well, he's kind of had it in for me since I kinda ran over his dog. Well, replace the word 'kinda' with the word 'repeatedly,' and the word 'dog' with 'son'.\\" Jessica Mellor of The Daily Mirror highlighted the episode in a review of The Simpsons season four DVD release, along with \\"Kamp Krusty\\", \\"New Kid on the Block\\", and \\"I Love Lisa\\", commenting: \\"Springfield's finest prove once again why they are the cleverest thing on telly.\\" In a section on the episode in their book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood wrote: \\"We like Bart's plan to rescue Marge from prison by becoming the glamorous Bartina, and Lionel Hutz is supremely inept\\".

It is employed as a literary device by authors to express shock, surprise or annoyance. The phrase is based on real nautical slang and is a reference to the timbers, which are the wooden support frames of a sailing ship. In heavy seas, ships would be lifted up and pounded down so hard as to \\"shiver\\" the timbers, startling the sailors. Such an exclamation was meant to convey a feeling of fear and awe, similar to, \\"Well, blow me down!\\", or, \\"May God strike me alive and well\\". Since on the high seas the ship was the sailors' 'world', it may also be interpreted as an exclamation for \\"shake my world\\" as the subject being referred to could be, or may be considered a potentially 'world shaking' event. \\"Shiver\\" is also reminiscent of the splintering of a ship's timbers in battle – splinter wounds were a common form of battle injury on wooden ships ('shiver' means splinter in some English dialects). Can also be used as an expression of being \\"cold to the bone\\". History Although the Oxford English Dictionary says the expression \\"shiver my timbers\\" probably first appeared in a published work by Frederick Marryat called Jacob Faithful (1835), the phrase actually appeared in print as early as 1795, in a serial publication called \\"Tomahawk, or Censor General\\", which gives an \\"extract of a new MS tragedy called 'Opposition'.\\" In the words of the \\"old sailor\\": :\\"Peace? Shiver my timbers! what a noise ye make – ye seem to be fonder of peace than ye be of quiet.\\" :... :\\"Lather me! – Shiver my timbers. if so be he comes athwart me – I'll soon lower his topsails for him – Here's King George and old England for ever!\\" The phrase appears in a news article: August 23, 1832 The Times from London, · Page 2 showing that the phrase was in use at the time. :\\"yarn about the Emp'ror 0 Rushy and we a' i2 Taiaxera; and shiver my timbers if I ah ...\\" The Argus Newspaper Archive: November 10, 1839 - Page 9 records the use in the news event as: \\"As for nine French men-of-war are laying along side us jist now, and overhauling our rigging and tactics, splinter my timbers into shivers if I don't think they are all buccaneers...\\" would indicate the meaning of \\"shivers\\" as the breaking into wedges, small pieces or slivers. Alternatively the word \\"slivers\\" itself (meaning a small, thin, narrow piece of something cut or split off a larger piece, which also defines a \\"splinter\\"), may be the word \\"shivers\\" expresses. The exact phrase is used earlier on the same page \\"Here's a breeze in a bumboat! shiver my timbers and top-lights, what will our Majesty's loblolly-boys say...\\". While the exact meaning may be different, the use was still that of an exclamation. The expression is a derivative of actual 18th century nautical slang, when the phrase \\"timbers!\\" or \\"my timbers!\\" meant an exclamation (cf. \\"my goodness!\\") as can be seen in Poor Jack, a song from 1789 by Charles Dibdin. The opening of the phrase, 'shiver my..', also predates Jacob Faithful with the following lines from John O'Keeffe's 1791 comic play Wild Oats an earlier example: :Harry: I say it's false. :John: False! Shiver my hulk, Mr. Buckskin, if you wore a lion's skin I'd curry you for this. =Pirate stereotypes= \\"Shiver my timbers\\" was most famously popularized by the archetypal pirate Long John Silver in Robert Louis Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883). Silver used the phrase seven times, as well as variations such as \\"shiver my sides\\", \\"shiver my soul\\" and \\"shake up your timbers\\". Another pirate, Israel Hands, also uses the phrase at one point. Marryat and Stevenson both wrote Victorian fiction using standard grammar, even when their characters were pirates. The use of \\"me\\" instead of \\"my\\", which is common to many British regional accents, has appeared in popular culture such as with Popeye; one of his earliest cartoons from 1934 is entitled Shiver Me Timbers! The phrase was also commonly used in Arthur Ransome's Swallows and Amazons books, where it was said at least once in almost every book, most commonly by \\"Amazon Pirate\\" Nancy Blackett. In popular culture * In the popular American cartoon Spongebob Squarepants, Eugene H. Krabs is heard using the phrase \\"shiver me timbers\\" often. *\\"Shiver me timbers\\" and \\"blow me down\\" are commonly said by Popeye. * \\"Shiver me timbers\\" was expressed by elite financial advisor Esme Squalor and main antagonist Count Olaf, in season 3 of A Series of Unfortunate Events, with explanation of definition by character Lemony Snicket. * The opening number of the children's film Muppet Treasure Island is entitled \\"Shiver My Timbers.\\" Several of the variants used in the original book are present in the chorus, including \\"shiver my soul,\\" \\"shiver my bones,\\" \\"shiver my sides,\\" and \\"shiver my sails.\\" * In the Canadian CGI-animated action-adventure cartoon series ReBoot, the software pirate captain Gavin Capacitor uses the pirate catchphrase mutation \\"Shiver me templates!\\". * In the Monk episode \\"Mr. Monk Is On the Air\\", Steven Weber's radio jockey character says a variation on the exclamation (\\"jiggle me timbers\\") on the air as his new catchphrase and this is revealed to be an important plot device in the episode. * In the 1967 film The Fearless Vampire Killers, Professor Abronsius uses this expression when observing (via telescope) the vampirised Yoyneh Shagal climb up the outside of his own inn and enter the bedroom of his maid by means of the window. * Tom Waits' 1974 album The Heart of Saturday Night includes his song by this name. * In the game Paladins, the character named Barik, uses the cryout \\"shiver me timbers!\\" as an emote.

Career A 6'3\\" former nightclub owner, he was spotted as a potential Jason Voorhees for Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives when he was playing Jason in a night club act, impressing the casting people who were in search of a new Jason since the current Jason actor Dan Bradley was not coming across as imposing or powerful as they had hoped for. He played Jason in all scenes and stunts except for the Paintball scene which they had already filmed with Bradley which marks the third instance of two actors portraying Jason in the same film. Graham reprised this role in the video for Alice Cooper's \\"He's Back (The Man Behind the Mask)\\", which was written for and featured in the film which blends footage from the film with some new footage. As of 2017, Graham has only played one other role – he appeared in the horror film Highway to Hell as the main antagonist, a heavily made-up, silent monster called the Hell Cop. As of 2010, Graham is the VP of casino operations at Thunder Valley Casino in Lincoln, California. This is similar to Heather Langenkamp (of A Nightmare on Elm Street fame) and Richard Brooker (of Friday the 13th Part III fame), who are both full-time business owners and part-time actors. He has been known to speak highly of his time as Jason, even claiming that he would reprise the role in another film if asked. Graham is currently the COO of the Ague Caliente Spa Resort and Casino in Rancho Mirage, California. According to an online interview with Kane Hodder, the actor who played Jason directly after Graham had, Graham actually had a chance to reprise the role of Jason years later in 2003 when the long-awaited film Freddy vs. Jason went into production and the producers of that film were searching for a new actor to play Jason; having decided to exclude Hodder after the four movies he had done as the iconic hockey-mask killer with supposed reasons ranging from his height compared to Robert Englund, the actor who portrayed Freddy Krueger in that film, to the producers simply wanting to try something different with Jason. Graham's agent wanted him to audition for the role again but Graham, both being a good friend of Hodder and feeling like the New Line producers were treating him unfairly with the re-casting decision, wanted no part in it.<ref> Ultimately, the role went to Canadian stuntman Ken Kirzinger. Graham commonly visits horror conventions and loves to meet his fans and sign autographs.

It replaces an earlier facility, dnotify, which had similar goals. Inotify was created by John McCutchan, and it was merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 2.6.13, released on August 29, 2005;Linux 2.6.13, kernelnewbies.org later kernel versions included further improvements. The required library interfaces were added into the GNU C Library (glibc) in its version 2.4, released in March 2006, while the support for inotify was completed in glibc version 2.5, released in September 2006.inotify man page Inotify can be used to automatically update directory views, reload configuration files, log changes, backup, synchronize, and upload. Inotifywait and inotifywatch commands allows use inotify subsystem from command line. inotify-tools wiki One major use is in desktop search utilities like Beagle, where its functionality permits reindexing of changed files without scanning the filesystem for changes every few minutes, which would be very inefficient.  Limitations  Limitations imposed by inotify include the following: * Inotify does not support recursively watching directories, meaning that a separate inotify watch must be created for every subdirectory.Robert Love, Linux system programming. O'Reilly, p. 236 * Inotify does report some but not all events in sysfs and procfs. * Notification via inotify requires the kernel to be aware of all relevant filesystem events, which is not always possible for networked filesystems such as NFS where changes made by one client are not immediately broadcast to other clients. * Rename events are not handled directly; i.e., inotify issues two separate events that must be examined and matched in a context of potential race conditions.  History  * July 2004: the first release announcement * August 29, 2005: Linux kernel version 2.6.13 released, containing merged inotify code * March 2006: GNU C Library (glibc) version 2.4 released, bringing initial inotify support * September 2006: Glibc version 2.5 released, bringing complete inotify support  Advantages over dnotify  There are a number of advantages when using inotify when compared to the older dnotify API that it replaced.Why inotify? inotify README file With dnotify, a program had to use one file descriptor for each directory that it was monitoring. This can become a bottleneck since the limit of file descriptors per process could be reached. Later, fanotify was created to overcome this issue. The use of file descriptors along with dnotify also proved to be a problem when using removable media. Devices could not be unmounted since file descriptors kept the resource busy. Another drawback of dnotify is the level of granularity, since programmers can only monitor changes at the directory level. To access detailed information about the environmental changes that occur when a notification message is sent, a stat structure must be used; this is considered a necessary evil in that a cache of stat structures has to be maintained, for every new stat structure generated a comparison is run against the cached one. The inotify API uses fewer file descriptors, allowing programmers to use the established select and poll interface, rather than the signal notification system used by dnotify. This also makes integration with existing select- or poll-based libraries (like GLib) easier.

Career =Role as Jason Voorhees= Director Ronny Yu tried to limit Kirzinger's stunts on the film as much as possible. Because of this stuntman Glenn Ennis was called in to perform a series of stunts, including a stunt showing Jason walking through a field killing teenagers while on fire.

Jason, played by Kane Hodder, threw Kirzinger over the counter. In addition to his role as the cook, Kirzinger also served as a stunt coordinator for the film. Kirzinger is only the second person besides Hodder to play Jason more than once as he doubled for the latter in the same movie in a few short scenes. Stunt scenes According to Kirzinger, the hardest thing he went through while performing as Jason in Freddy vs. Jason (2003) was sinking into the lake. They shot the scene in a tank which was highly chlorinated and had debris to make it look like lake water. Director Ronny Yu wanted the close-up of Ken's eye and wanted him to sink into the water keeping his eye open. He also could not breathe because it would be visible on film. He was lying on top of the water and had to let himself sink down to the bottom of the tank without breathing and keeping his eye open.

Early life and military career Rowan was born in County Antrim, fifth of the ten sons of Robert Rowan, an impoverished landowner of Scottish descent. He went to school in Carrickfergus. In 1797, he was commissioned an ensign in the 52nd Regiment of Foot. He was promoted Paymaster in 1798, lieutenant in 1799, captain in 1803, brevet major in 1809, major in 1811, Brevet lieutenant-colonel in 1812, and finally lieutenant- colonel - all his promotions above captain were field promotions, not purchases. The Waterloo Medal awarded to Rowan on display at the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Museum in Woodstock. Rowan saw active service during the Napoleonic Wars, in Sicily in 1806-1808, Sweden in 1808, and then in the Peninsular War, fighting at the Battles of Corunna, Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz, Buçaco, Fuentes d'Oñoro, the Coa and Salamanca, and serving as brigade major of the Light Brigade from 1809 and as assistant adjutant-general of the Light Division from 1811. As regimental second-in-command, he commanded a wing of the 52nd Foot at the Battle of Waterloo, where he was wounded, and was made a Companion of the Bath (CB) for his services. He returned to England with his regiment in 1818, and was stationed in the Midlands until 1821, when he took it to Dublin as commanding officer. He retired from the army by sale of his commission on 26 April 1822 and may then have served as a magistrate in his native Ireland. Rowan's eldest brother was Lieutenant-Colonel John Rowan (1778-1855), an officer in the Antrim Militia, an Irish regiment of the British Army that took a leading part in the campaign against the radical United Irishmen in June 1798, one of the decisive chapters in Irish history. He was later High Sheriff of County Antrim (1814) and played a prominent role in northern Irish society. Other notable brothers were Field Marshal Sir William Rowan (1789-1879), Britain's Commander-in-Chief, North America (1849), and Major James Rowan (born 1781), who was appointed Chief Police Magistrate for the Town and Territory of Gibraltar in 1830. Foundation of the Metropolitan Police In June 1829, Rowan was selected by Home Secretary Sir Robert Peel as founding senior Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police (or Metropolitan Police Magistrate) after the first man offered the job, Lieutenant-Colonel James Shaw, had turned it down. Peel was probably acting on advice from the Duke of Wellington and Sir George Murray, Wellington's Quartermaster-General in the Peninsula and now Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in his government, who had been impressed by Rowan's conduct at Waterloo. Rowan was to provide the military discipline and organisation that it was felt the new police force needed and the junior Commissioner, barrister Richard Mayne, was to provide the legal expertise. Over the next twenty years, the two men were to become firm friends, and their close co-operation was to provide a solid foundation for the new police force. Rowan and Mayne took up their new posts on 7 July 1829. Later that month, they moved their offices into 4 Whitehall Place, and Rowan also took up residence in an apartment at the top of the building. On 29 August, they were sworn in as Justices of the Peace by Lord Chief Baron Sir William Alexander. The two Commissioners were almost entirely responsible for the organisation of the new force. In twelve weeks, they managed to recruit, train, organise, equip and deploy a force of nearly one thousand men. They drew up regulations and pay scales, designed and ordered uniforms and equipment, and found, purchased and furnished station houses. Rowan's military experience led to the division of London into six divisions, each divided into eight sections, each of which was divided into eight beats. The beat system, with each constable almost overlapping the next, was based on the Shorncliffe System for light infantry, devised by Sir John Moore, Rowan's commander in the Peninsula (and who had paid for his captaincy in 1803). It is possible that it was Rowan's idea to outfit the police in more civilian-styled blue uniforms rather than the scarlet and gold that Peel had originally envisaged. Since there was heated debate over whether the police should even be uniformed at all (due to fears of a European-style gendarmerie), this was undoubtedly a wise move. Rowan did, however, insist that his men were drilled and laid down the highest standards of conduct, dismissing men for the slightest infringement even before the police had begun patrolling the streets of London. During the first two years of the force's existence, half of its original constables were dismissed, mainly for drunkenness, absenteeism, and frequenting pubs and fraternising with prostitutes while on duty. Officers were to ensure that they treated members of the public with respect and courtesy at all times. On the other hand, Rowan insisted that his senior officers treat their men with kindness and fairness and without undue harshness or authoritarianism. On 16 September 1829, the two Commissioners personally swore in their new constables at the Foundling Hospital. The new force first took to the streets at 6:00 p.m. on 29 September. Police Commissioner For 21 years, Rowan served as Commissioner. The early years were difficult, as the new force faced opposition from the Whigs, who had opposed its formation and formed a new government four years afterwards, and the London magistrates and parish vestries, many of whom were none too keen on losing their own parish constables and in some cases continued to employ the services of the Bow Street Runners. The trouble with the Whigs came to a head in 1834, when the government demanded that Rowan and Mayne dismiss Inspector Squire Wovenden and his divisional commander, Superintendent Lazenby, after a prostitute falsely accused Wovenden of raping her in a cell and Lazenby refused to discipline him. The Commissioners felt obliged to dismiss the two officers for the good of the force, but refused to accept their guilt and wrote to the government in protest. This paid off when the consequent Parliamentary Select Committee on the Police reported on 13 August, backing the Metropolitan Police (although Wovenden and Lazenby were never reinstated), removing the power of the magistrates over them, and abolishing most of the other constables in London (including the Bow Street Runners, many of whom transferred to the police). In 1835, Lord John Russell, the Home Secretary, even agreed to pay compensation to officers injured on duty. On 6 March 1848, Rowan's achievements and those of his force were acknowledged when he was made a Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB). In 1850, aged nearly 68 and having been diagnosed with colon cancer, he retired. He died at his residence in Norfolk Street (now known as Dunraven Street), Park Lane, London on 8 May 1852, and his remains were deposited in Catacomb B beneath the Anglican Chapel of Kensal Green Cemetery six days later.Registers of the General Cemetery Company; Bishops' Transcript on Ancestry.co.uk. Rowan was a bachelor and an evangelical Anglican. His principal hobbies were salmon fishing and shooting, often using as a base Floors Castle in Scotland, seat of his friend, James Innes-Ker, 6th Duke of Roxburghe.

Early life and education Patrick O'Boyle was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Michael and Mary (née Muldoon) O'Boyle, who were Irish immigrants. His father was originally from Glenties, County Donegal, and in 1889 came to the United States, where he settled at Bedford, New York. His mother moved to New York City from County Mayo in 1879, and later married O'Boyle in December 1893. Shortly afterwards they moved to Scranton, where Michael became a steelworker; they had a daughter who died during infancy in 1895. Patrick was baptized two days after his birth at St. Paul's Church in Scranton. Following his father's death in January 1907, he helped support his mother by becoming a paperboy. He dropped out of school in 1910 to pursue a full-time career with the Bradstreet Company, but entered St. Thomas College in 1911 upon the orders of a local priest. In addition to his studies, he there served as class librarian and editor of the monthly magazine The Aquinas. Priesthood O'Boyle graduated from St. Thomas' as valedictorian in 1916, and then began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers, New York. During his time at St. Joseph's, he developed a close friendship with James Francis McIntyre, later Archbishop of Los Angeles and a cardinal as well, who tutored him in Latin and invited him to spend holidays with his family. One of his professors was Rev. Francis P. Duffy, a famed chaplain of World War I. O'Boyle was ordained a priest by Archbishop Patrick Joseph Hayes on May 21, 1921. The next day he celebrated his first Mass at St. Paul's Church in his native Scranton. He returned to New York the following June, when he became a curate at St. Columba's Church in the Chelsea section of Manhattan. He there organized St. Joseph's Society for teenaged boys, beginning with about 300 members, and instituted parish dances. From 1926 to 1933, O'Boyle was director of the Catholic Guardian Society, a division of Catholic Charities dedicated to orphans and foster children; during this time, he also resided and did pastoral work at Holy Innocents Church.

He was director of the War Relief Services of the National Catholic Welfare Conference (1943–1947), before being named director of the Catholic Charities in New York on August 1, 1947. Bishop According to Raymond Kupke, O'Boyle's work at War Relief Services and his ability in dealing with governmental and non-governmental agencies during the war and postwar periods caught the attention of the Apostolic Delegate, Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani.Kupke, Raymond. Review: MacGregor. \\"Steadfast in Faith\\", Catholic Historical Review, Volume 93, Number 3, July 2007, pp725-727 On November 27, 1947, he was appointed Archbishop of Washington by Pope Pius XII. O'Boyle received his episcopal consecration on January 14, 1948 from Cardinal Francis Spellman, with Bishops John McNamara and Henry Klonowski serving as co-consecrators, in St. Patrick's Cathedral. According to Wickouski, O'Boyle's view of his role was shaped by his experience as an administrator under Spellman. Known for his opposition to racism,TIME Magazine.

Bertha's marriage to the king in 1072 was a result of peace negotiations between him and her stepfather, Count Robert I of Flanders. After nine years of childlessness, the royal couple had three children, including Philip's successor, Louis VI. Philip, however, grew tired of his wife by 1090, and repudiated her in 1092 in order to marry the already married Bertrade of Montfort. That marriage was a scandal since both Philip and Bertrade were already married to other people, at least until Queen Bertha died the next year. Early life Bertha of Holland marrying King Philip I Bertha was the daughter of Count Floris I of Holland and Gertrude of Saxony.William (of Malmesbury), Gesta Regum Anglorum: The History of the English Kings: General introduction and commentary, Volume 2, Roger Aubrey Baskerville Mynors, Rodney M. Thomson and Michael Winterbottom, (Oxford University Press, 1999), 244. Bertha had six siblings and both of her parents came from large families. Her father ruled a territory vaguely described as \\"Friesland west of the Vlie\\", which is where Bertha spent her childhood. Count Floris I was assassinated in 1061, and two years later her mother remarried to Robert of Flanders. Robert, now known as Robert the Frisian, became guardian of Bertha and her six siblings. In 1070, Robert the Frisian became involved in a war with King Philip I of France over succession to the County of Flanders. Within two years, Robert and Philip concluded a peace treaty which was to be sealed by a marriage; Robert's own daughters were too young, but their half-sister Bertha was just the right age. Robert thus agreed to the marriage of his stepdaughter to King Philip. Bertha married Philip, thus becoming queen of the Franks, probably in 1072.  Queenship  Queen Bertha and King Philip with their children Bertha was, at the time, the lowest ranking woman to marry a French king; no suitable princess could be found, since they were all too closely related to Philip for the marriage to any of them to be seen as perfectly valid by the Church. Bertha had no kings among her traceable ancestors and lacked even tenuous links with the Carolingian that her predecessors could claim. Consequently, contemporary chroniclers did not even try to present her lineage as more exalted than that of a count's daughter. Nevertheless, the shortage of royal candidates made Bertha a suitable choice. The regal title she gained by this marriage was prestigious, but had little meaning, as she was confined to her husband's small royal domain that covered little more than areas around Paris and Orléans. Little is known about Bertha's queenship. She co-signed only three donation charters. However, she plays a prominent role in the hagiography titled Vita Arnulfi. The hagiography describes how she used her regal power (vi regia) to expel Abbot Gerard of Saint-Médard and reinstate the former abbot, Pontius, who had been removed due to his mismanagement of the abbey. Saint Arnulf of Soissons warned her that doing so would incur the wrath of God and lead to her being driven out of the kingdom into exile, where she would die despised and miserable. The queen furiously refused to listen to him. Although all the extant versions of Vita Arnulfi refer to the queen as Bertrada, it is clear that the queen mentioned in the hagiography is Bertha of Holland, given that the events mentioned in it took place while Bertha was queen and more than a decade before she was replaced as such by Bertrade. The hagiography, however, was written after Bertha died and during Bertrade's queenship, which might explain the name confusion. = Childlessness = For six years, King Philip and Queen Bertha were troubled by their childlessness and especially by the lack of male children, which was not unusual among the early male members of the House of Capet. Things suddenly took a different course, however, when the Queen had three children in quick succession: a daughter named Constance in 1078 and two sons, the long-hoped heir named Louis in 1081 and Henry, born in 1083 and who died in infancy. The birth of the long-awaited heir apparent had such a great impact that a story of a miracle developed around it. Reportedly, the couple's fertility was only restored thanks to the prayers of a hermit, Saint Arnulf of Soissons. Arnulf informed Queen Bertha that she was expecting a son and that it would be appropriate to give him the Carolingian name of Louis. A daughter named Constance soon followed. Bertha gave birth to one more son, named Henry, but he appears to have died in infancy or childhood.  Repudiation  King Philip marries Countess Bertrada, with Count Fulk protesting and Queen Bertha imprisoned in a castle After the birth of three children, the marriage began breaking apart. The King became tired of his wife but the reasons are unclear. Contemporary chroniclers give different explanations. According to the English historian William of Malmesbury, Philip complained that Bertha was \\"too fat\\", though he was himself becoming too obese to ride a horse. In 1092, Philip announced his decision to divorce \\"the noble and virtuous daughter of Florent count of Holland and stepdaughter of Robert the Frisian\\" and marry the already married Bertrada of Montfort, the wife of Count Fulk IV of Anjou. The repudiated queen withdrew to the fortress of Montreuil-sur-Mer, which was part of her dower land. By doing so, Philip infuriated his stepfather-in-law. Bertha died soon thereafter, on 15 October 1094 This simplified matters for Philip who was now free to remarry – though not the Countess of Anjou, whose husband Fulk was still living. In 1108, Philip died. The son of the queen who had been repudiated ostensibly for her obesity ascended the French throne as Louis VI. Both he and her fraternal nephew, Count Floris II of Holland, were nicknamed \\"the Fat\\". Issue Together, Philip and Bertha had three children: #Constance (1078 – 14 September 1126), married Hugh I of Champagne before 1097 and then, after her divorce, to Bohemund I of Antioch in 1106. #Louis VI of France (1 December 1081 – 1 August 1137). #Henry (1083 – died young).

Its title (borrowed from Winnie-the-Pooh author A.A. Milne's collection of poems for children) refers to both its sequence among their albums, and the band's size, in light of the addition of drummer Nigel Pegrum. It reached number 13 in the UK albums chart. Although two session drummers had been employed on the group's debut, subsequent albums had seen little use of percussion. However, after Parcel of Rogues there was a conscious decision to add a full-time drummer to bolster the band's rock-oriented sound. It has been suggested that the sound of the group on this album is that of a rock band turning towards folk, and not the other way around. Pegrum also contributed flute and oboe parts. Production Now We Are Six was produced by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson, although he admitted that his part in the making of the album was minimal except for a little supervision and the invitation of David Bowie to play the saxophone.http://prog.teamrock.com/news/2015-06-15/ian-anderson- reveals-folk-rock-heroes Criticism The album received mixed reviews from critics. It was hailed as a finely crafted set of traditional songs given clever arrangements, and the track \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\", which was released as a single, was seen by many as the quintessential Steeleye track. Another highlight is \\"The Mooncoin Jig\\", which is a showcase for Peter Knight's abilities on mandolin and banjo; the track is a mix of folk and rock, with neither overshadowing the other. Both tracks also show how well drums fit into the increasingly elaborate sound. The main criticisms of the album seemed largely to concern the inclusion of three tracks. The title track is a set of riddles sung by the band with only a piano accompaniment, and \\"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\\" is the familiar children's song, given the same treatment. Credited as the \\"St. Eleye Primary School Junior Choir\\", the band sang these songs imitating children. The inclusion of the songs is valid in many respects, for the material is traditional, but they do stand out as rather unusual and jarring. Many people also did not \\"get\\" the joke about the \\"St. Eleye\\" school choir, believing it was an actual school choir singing the songs (the joke being that a) St. Eleye is not a real saint, and b) \\"St. Eleye\\" is almost \\"Steeleye\\"). Bassist Rick Kemp believes the songs were misplaced on the album, and should instead have come at the end. The track that did end the album is the other one which created some consternation among critics - a version of Phil Spector's \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\" which features, as a guest, David Bowie on alto saxophone. The inclusion of a rock 'n' roll standard baffled many listeners who had come to expect Steeleye Span's interpretations of traditional fare; what is generally not known, however, is that the track does represent an aspect of Steeleye Span's live show at that time (1974). They were known for doing a rock and roll encore during this period, influenced by the band Sha Na Na with whom they toured. After ending their regular set, they would leave the stage and emerge a few minutes later, almost entirely unrecognizable, in '50s-styled rock and roll costumes, and play such numbers as \\"Long Tall Sally\\", \\"Da Doo Ron Ron\\", and the aforementioned \\"To Know Him Is To Love Him\\". \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" Two versions of \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" were recorded. The song, also known as \\"True Thomas\\", was released as a single running 3:14, and as a longer LP version running 6:44. This version, which alternates loud and soft sections, was released on the original version of the Chrysalis UK LP Now We Are Six. When the album was issued in the United States, however, it included the short version, apparently on the assumption that the shorter version would be more radio-friendly and more appealing to American audiences. Most reissues of this album contain the short version of \\"Thomas the Rhymer\\" with the exception of the BGO CD reissue. Present--The Very Best of Steeleye Span, which was composed of new versions of the band's older material, includes a longer version of the song, running 6:38. 2011: Now We Are Six - live For Steeleye Span's spring 2011 tour, the first half set consisted of them playing the album in its entirety, some 37 years after it was first released.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 4, 1993. After Marge invites her neighbor Ruth Powers to attend the ballet, they become friends. Homer grows jealous of their friendship and pursues them, resulting in a police chase led by Chief Wiggum that ends in near-disaster. The episode, which serves largely as a parody of the film Thelma & Louise and the Dragnet franchise, was written by Bill Canterbury and directed by Mark Kirkland. Phil Hartman, Pamela Reed and George Fenneman were the guest stars. Plot After donating money to public television, Marge receives complimentary ballet tickets. Homer agrees to accompany her but gets both of his arms stuck in vending machines at work. Disappointed and doubting Homer's story, Marge invites her neighbor, Ruth Powers, to go with her instead. They enjoy themselves and continue spending time together visiting bars and clubs in Springfield. Ruth demonstrates how to use a pistol to Marge, who uses a forlorn farmer's \\"precious antique cans\\" for target practice. To show he can have a good time without Marge, Homer hires Lionel Hutz to babysit Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Finding Moe's Tavern more depressing than usual, Homer visits the hilltop where he and Marge used to spend time before they got married. Homer tries bashing a weather station -- which he used to do on their dates -- but finds it is no fun without Marge. While tending his moonshine still on the hill, Chief Wiggum spots Homer and offers him a ride. Wiggum tries to make a routine traffic stop, but Ruth leads him on a high-speed chase instead. Ruth reveals that she is driving her ex-husband's stolen car as revenge for his failure to pay child support. Still in Wiggum's backseat, Homer realizes Marge is in Ruth's car and suspects she is leaving him after discovering that she can have a better time without him. Ruth successfully evades Wiggum by turning off her headlights, making him think he is chasing a ghost car. After seeing Marge and Ruth again the next morning, Wiggum continues his chase, joined by other police cars. Homer sees a cliff ahead and mistakenly thinks Marge and Ruth are attempting suicide. He uses a megaphone to apologize to Marge for all of his shortcomings and urges them not to drive into the Grand Chasm. Ruth, suddenly aware of the cliff, slams on the brakes and stops near its edge. Homer and Wiggum fail to stop in time, fly off the cliff's edge, and land in a mountain of landfill debris. They emerge slightly soiled from the garbage but otherwise unscathed. A narrator describes the fates of the characters: * Ruth is accused of auto theft by her ex-husband, who is forced to pay the child support he owes her after his attorney, Hutz, botches the case. * Hutz gladly receives $8 for 32 hours of babysitting the Simpsons' children. * Marge is forced to pay $2000.50 in compensation to the farmer for destroying his cans. * Homer, whose baldness is implied to be the result of a US Army experiment he volunteered for as a human guinea pig to avoid visiting Patty and Selma, is remanded to their Neurological Research Center in Fort Meade, Maryland for further testing. Production Dan Castellaneta actually used a bullhorn to record his part when Homer was talking on one. The sunset shown when Marge and Ruth are at the café was airbrushed in, although the episode was done before computer animation was put into practice. Cultural references George Fenneman narrates the end of the episode, a parody of Dragnet Much of the plot, including the scene when Homer is in Moe's Tavern, and the climax where Ruth's blue convertible and Homer and Wiggum's fall over the chasm, is a parody of the Ridley Scott film Thelma & Louise. The music played during Homer's visualisation of the term ballet is Entrance of the Gladiators by Julius Fučík. Crystal Buzz Cola is a reference to the fad drink Crystal Pepsi, and when Homer reaches into the vending machine, a can of Fresca is seen in a skeletal hand stuck there. The comedian who performs at the telethon who the Simpson family does not find funny is a parody of Garrison Keillor.. Ruth mistakenly inserts Lesley Gore's song \\"Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows\\" into her car stereo before beginning her and Marge's wild night out; later, Chief Wiggum plays the song on his police cruiser's stereo as \\"appropriate\\" car chase music. After extracting the wrong tape, Ruth pops in \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses. Quimby dancing in a night club is in reference to the Kennedys. When Marge gets hit on in the bar, the guy who does not talk is a caricature of show runner David Mirkin. The old man that comes out when Marge is shooting his cans is a parody of Walter Brennan. The episode's closing sequence is a reference to Dragnet. George Fenneman recorded the ending in the same fashion as he did on Dragnet. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Marge on the Lam\\" finished 32nd in ratings for the week of November 1–7, 1993, with a Nielsen rating of 13.1, equivalent to approximately 12.2 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Beverly Hills, 90210. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said \\"Marge getting to let her hair down is always a treat, and in Ruth Powers she seems to have a real friend. A pity we don't see more of her\\". The A.V. Club named Homer's line \\"Stupid TV! Be more funny!\\" as one of the quotes from The Simpsons that can be used in everyday situations. On their 2000 album And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out, indie rock band Yo La Tengo has a song entitled \\"Let's Save Tony Orlando's House\\"; the song is named after a telethon in Troy McClure's fictional CV seen in this episode.

History In the 1910s, a small earthen dike was constructed. This containment was breached by the storm surge from the Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 and the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane, killing thousands. After these disasters the Florida State Legislature created the Okeechobee Flood Control District, which was authorized to cooperate with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in flood control undertakings. After a personal inspection of the area by President Herbert Hoover, the Corps drafted a new plan which provided for the construction of floodway channels, control gates, and major levees along Lake Okeechobee's shores. A long term system was designed for the purpose of flood control, water conservation, prevention of saltwater intrusion, and preservation of fish and wildlife populations. In the 1930s, a larger system of levees was built around the lake. Following heavy precipitation and flooding from two hurricanes in 1947, the dike was again expanded in the 1960s to create the current Herbert Hoover Dike. The dike almost completely encloses the lake. The only gap in the dike is at Fisheating Creek, where the dike turns inland and parallels the stream on both sides for several miles, leaving Fisheating Creek as the only remaining free-flowing tributary of Lake Okeechobee. The cost of construction was about US$165 million. The dike is now about 30 feet (9 meters) high on average. This should be sufficient to protect against future storm surges or flooding; however, there are some concerns that the dike is falling into disrepair. The Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail, a bicycle path running atop the dike, was dedicated in 1993. The trail began as the 'Okeechobee Segment of the Florida National Scenic Trail (FNST), and is part of a 1,000 mile trail between Miami and Pensacola. =Video history= A short video history of the Herbert Hoover Dike produced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, titled USACE: Lake Okeechobee and the Herbert Hoover Dike. The video can be watched for free here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpkhJgV_mLo. Environment Over the years, issues with flood control around the lake have caused damage to the environment. This has also led to the recent algae bloom (2016) by preventing the natural flow of rivers from the lake to flush the algae out to sea. Decades of runoff from agricultural and other land uses have exacerbated the water quality issues in Lake Okeechobee. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers =Authorization= The Herbert Hoover Dike (HHD) is a component of the Central and Southern Florida (C&SF;) Project for Flood Control and other Purposes. The C&SF; project was authorized in the Flood Control Act of 1948, 1954, 1960, 1965, and 1968; authorization in 1970 under Section 201 of the Flood Control Act of 1965; the Water Resources Development Act(WRDA) of 1986, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1996 and 2007; and the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1930. =Background= The HHD system consists of approximately 143 miles of levee surrounding Lake Okeechobee, with 32 culverts, hurricane gates and other water control structures. The first embankments around Lake Okeechobee were constructed by local interests from sand and muck, circa 1915. Hurricane tides overtopped the original embankments in 1926 and 1928 causing over 3,000 deaths. The River and Harbor Act of 1930 authorized the construction of 67.8 miles of levee along the south shore of Lake Okeechobee and 15.7 miles of levee along the north shore. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed the levees between 1932 and 1938 with crest heights ranging from +32 to +35 feet, National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). A major hurricane in 1947 prompted the need for additional flood protection work. As a result, the United States Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1948 authorizing the first phase of the C&SF; project, a comprehensive plan to provide flood protection and other water control benefits in central and south Florida. By the late 1960s the new dike system was completed, raising the elevation of the levees to a maximum +41 feet, NGVD. This provides protection to the Standard Project Flood (SPF) level, approximately an event occurring once in 935 years. However, investigations conducted in the 1980s and early 1990s of the dike system's potential seepage and stability problems resulted in the identification of two major areas of concern: the seepage and embankment stability at the culvert locations, and the problematic foundation conditions of the dike. During high water events piping is experienced thru the levee. In 1999, the Corps developed a plan to rehabilitate the HHD. The plan was approved in 2000 and divided the 143 mile embankment into eight reaches with the initial focus on Reach 1. This Reach by Reach rehabilitation approach has been replaced with a system wide risk reduction approach as required for safety modifications to dams.

St-Jacques served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2004. History St-Jacques was born in Granby, Quebec. She was a promotional coordinator for Agropur in Granby, and advertising consultant for a radio station in Sherbrooke. St-Jacques was involved in the community in a variety of volunteer roles. Involved in politics since 1979, St-Jacques first stood for office in the 1997 federal election as the Progressive Conservative candidate for Shefford. With Sherbrooke's Jean Charest as national leader, the party experienced a resurgence in Quebec's Eastern Townships, and St-Jacques was elected to the House of Commons, taking her seat from the Bloc Québécois. Until she left the PC caucus, she was its designated parliamentary critic for International Cooperation, La Francophonie, and children and youth. She was also identified as the PC \\"family critic.\\" In 1999, St-Jacques joined MPs Svend Robinson (NDP) and Réal Ménard (Bloc), both openly gay, and Toronto Liberal MP Bill Graham, in a \\"pink caucus\\" across party lines. The group advocated that the legal definition of spouse include same-sex couples. The social conservative Campaign Life Coalition decried St.-Jacques as \\"a married mother of one, who says she isn't a lesbian but who supports the gay agenda.\\" St-Jacques spoke in Parliament in favour of medical marijuana rights. In April 1998, Charest left federal politics to seek the leadership of the Quebec Liberal Party, and Tory support in Quebec declined under Joe Clark's leadership. On September 12, 2000, with an election increasingly close, St- Jacques, with fellow Tory MP David Price and independent, formerly Tory MP André Harvey, joined the Liberal Party of Canada and the Liberal caucus. St- Jacques and Price reportedly told Clark they would leave the party months earlier. In the 2000 election, St-Jacques retained her Shefford seat as a Liberal. She served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development in the government of prime minister Jean Chrétien from January 13 until December 11, 2003, and as Deputy Government Whip under Chrétien's successor Paul Martin from February 2, 2004, until she left office. In the 2004 federal election, she lost her seat to Robert Vincent of the Bloc Québécois. She ran again in the 2006 federal election, placing third place behind Vincent and the Conservative candidate Jean Lambert. She received 23.4% of all votes cast.

It is in the parish of Kentchurch and lies midway between Hereford and Abergavenny. In 2011 the main village contained 66 residential dwellings, as well as Pontrilas Business Park. The village name comes from the Welsh language, and means 'bridge over three rivers' due to the River Dore, Dulas brook and another smaller stream (which descends via Dineterwood but appears to have no specific name) meeting there. The main A465 road skirts the west of the village. The neighbouring villages include; Ewyas Harold, Llangua, Dulas, Wormbridge, Kilpeck, Bagwyllydiart, Abbey Dore and Howton. History There has been a settlement in the area since at least 1086 when the hamlet was called Elwistone, possibly originating from the Welsh names Elwin or Helys. Over the centuries there have been several variations of name e.g. Ailstone and Heliston. The latter being the name of a terrace of houses in the modern day village. The name Pontrilas originally only belonged to the manor house, once one of the homes of the Baskerville family, which sits beside the bridge over the River Dore, near where it meets the Dulas brook and another smaller stream. From 1750 the hamlet was also marked as Pontrilas on maps. With the coming of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway line in 1854. The line was sponsored by the London North Western Railway and merger with other lines took place in 1860 with the West Midland Railway which itself was taken over to eventually result in the Great Western Railway running the line from 1863. A local company constructed the Golden Valley Railway line in 1881 and the hamlet grew in importance.However the line was not a financial success and it closed in 1898. It was subsequently purchased and reopened in 1901 by the GWR. The village had a cattle market and a pub, The Pontrilas Inn built by the Scudamore family, who still own a lot of land in the area. The pub was burned down in the 1970s. There was also a chemical factory owned by Wrekin Chemical Co beside the main railway line to the north of the village. Since the closing of the station in 1958 the village has declined in importance, though it does still boast an auction room and a number of businesses including Pontrilas Timber which has been there since 1947, an estate agency and a number of other smaller businesses. The former World War II Elm Bridge munitions depot is now the site of the Qinetiq managed Pontrilas Army Training Area. Transport Pontrilas is served by Stagecoach South Wales service X4 which runs between Hereford and Cardiff and National Express Coaches service 321 which links Aberdare and Bradford Pontrilas railway station is currently closed but has the potential to be re-opened with services calling for passengers on the Welsh Marches Line.

In 1712, an outbreak of measles struck the French royal family, causing a number of significant deaths. First to die was the Dauphine, Marie Adélaïde of Savoy. Within a week of her death, her heartbroken husband, Louis the Dauphin, also died, leaving his sons Louis, Duke of Brittany, and Louis, Duke of Anjou, orphaned, and the elder son as heir to the throne. The sickness, however, had not yet run its course: both the Duke of Brittany (now Dauphin) and the Duke of Anjou became ill with measles. The Dauphin was ministered to by the royal doctors, who bled him in the belief that it would help him to recover; instead, it merely weakened the young boy, who swiftly died, leaving the Duke of Anjou as Dauphin. Deciding that she would not allow the same treatment to be applied to the Duke of Anjou, Madame de Ventadour locked herself up with three nursery maids and refused to allow the doctors near the boy. Louis survived his disease, becoming King of France upon the death of his great- grandfather three years later. Madame de Ventadour continued in her position as royal governess until 1717, when the boy king was deemed old enough to be raised by men. Her husband died in the same year. She then became Lady-in- waiting to Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate, Dowager Duchess of Orléans, widow of Philippe de France, Duke of Orléans, only sibling of Louis XIV. She died at the Château de Glatigny, her residence in Versailles. Through her daughter she is an ancestress of the Princes of Guéméné of the House of Rohan, who presently live in Austria.

She was the third wife of actor Cary Grant. Early life and education Betsy Drake, the eldest child of two American expatriates, was born in Paris. Her grandfather, Tracy Drake, and his brother had opened the Drake Hotel in Chicago on New Year's Eve in 1920.History, Drake Hotel, Retrieved 10 September 2016 The Drakes lost their money in the 1929 stock-market crash. As a result, she returned to the U.S. on the with her parents, brothers, and a nanny. She grew up in Chicago; Westport, Connecticut; Washington, DC; Virginia; North Carolina; and New York City. She went to 12 different schools, both private and public, before concentrating on theatre and acting at National Park Seminary. Career She began looking for work as an actress in New York City, supporting herself by working as a Conover model. She met the playwright Horton Foote, who offered her a job as an understudy in his play Only the Heart, which enabled her to join the Actors' Equity Association and thus become a professional actress. After coming to the attention of the producer Hal Wallis, Drake was pressured by her agent to sign a Hollywood contract. She hated Hollywood and managed to get herself released from the contract by declaring herself insane. She returned to New York City and, in 1947, read for the director Elia Kazan for the lead role in the London company of the play Deep Are the Roots. Later that year, Drake was selected by Kazan as one of the founding members of the Actors Studio. Cary Grant first spotted her in 1947 while she was performing in London. The two, who both happened to be returning to the U.S. on the , struck up an instant rapport. At the insistence of Grant, Drake was subsequently signed to a film contract by RKO Pictures and David Selznick, where she appeared, opposite Grant, in her first film, the romantic comedy Every Girl Should Be Married (1948). New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther called her performance “foxily amusing”. On Christmas Day 1949, Drake and Grant married in a private ceremony organized by Grant's best man, Howard Hughes, and deliberately chose a low-key, introspective private life. They delved into transcendentalism, mysticism, and yoga. She took up causes including the plight of homeless children in Los Angeles. In 1954, they bought the \\"Las Palomas\\" estate in the Movie Colony neighborhood of Palm Springs, California. The couple co-starred in the radio series Mr. and Mrs. Blanding (1951). They appeared together in the comedy-drama Room for One More (1952), and Drake appeared in a number of leading roles in England and the U.S., and a supporting role in the satiric comedy film Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957). Drake subsequently gave up acting to focus on her other interests, such as writing. Under the name Betsy Drake Grant, her novel Children, You Are Very Little (1971) was published by Atheneum Books. She worked as a volunteer and studied at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute, and earned a Master of Education degree from Harvard University. Drake's last screen appearance was in the documentary film Cary Grant: A Class Apart (2005), in which she reflected on Grant and their time together, and denied rumors alleging he was bisexual. Personal life In July 1956, Drake survived the sinking of the Italian ocean liner SS Andrea Doria. At the time, she had been visiting Grant in Spain and was returning to the United States. She boarded the Doria, along with dozens of other wealthy travelers and tourists, at Gibraltar, which was one of many stops the ship made between her home port of Genoa and her final destination of New York. Drake sailed as a first-class passenger, occupying a single cabin on the ship's boat deck. When the Doria collided with the Stockholm, Drake waited with the other passengers for rescue, as the ship's severe list rendered half the Doria's lifeboats useless. She was among more than 700 people rescued from the Doria by the famed French passenger liner Île de France. Drake wrote the original script for the film Houseboat (1958), starring Grant, who originally intended that she would star with him. However, Grant began an affair with Sophia Loren while filming The Pride and the Passion (1957), and Grant arranged for Loren to take Drake's place in Houseboat, with a rewritten script for which Drake did not receive credit. The affair ended in bitterness before The Pride and the Passions filming ended, causing problems on the Houseboat set. Grant and Drake separated in 1958, remaining friends, and divorced in 1962. Their marriage constituted his longest union. Grant credited her with broadening his interests beyond his career and with introducing him to the then-legal LSD therapy, which he claimed helped him finally to achieve a degree of mental peace, and to hypnosis, which he used to successfully quit smoking. Later, Drake took LSD as a way of recovering from the trauma of divorce. Drake had no children with Grant and never remarried. Drake spent the latter part of her life in London, where she died aged 92 on October 27, 2015.

The long title of the Act is \\"An Act to amend an Act, intituled An Act to carry into execution a Convention between His Majesty and the Emperor of Brazil, for the Regulation and final Abolition of the African Slave Trade\\".  History  The Act was proposed by British Foreign Secretary Lord Aberdeen. It gave the Royal Navy authority to stop and search any Brazilian ship suspected of being a slave ship on the high seas, and to arrest slave traders caught on these ships. The Act stipulated that arrested slave traders could be tried in British courts. The law was designed to suppress the Brazilian slave trade, to make effective Brazilian laws and the British-Brazilian Treaty of 1826 to end the Atlantic slave trade, that Brazil had signed and ratified but failed to enforce. It provoked outrage in Brazil, where it was seen as a violation of free market, freedom of navigation, as an affront Brazilian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and as an attempt to check Brazil's rise as a world power.  Controversies  As a result, the Royal Navy began intercepting Brazilian slavers on the high seas, and Brazilian slave traders caught on these ships were prosecuted in British admiralty courts. Over the following years, the number of cases in British admiralty courts increased dramatically due to the large number of Brazilians arrested for slave-trading - in the first six months of 1848, 19 out of 33 cases heard by the vice admiralty court in St. Helena were Brazilian.Martinez, Jenny S. The Slave Trade and the Origins of International Human Rights Law (2012), Oxford University Press. Despite the aggressive application of this law, the volume of the Brazilian slave trade increased in the late 1840s; the demand for slaves had increased due to British free-trade legislation that lifted tariffs on Brazilian sugar. However, Anglo-Brazilian tensions continued to increase. In 1850-51, a handful of British ships began entering Brazilian territorial waters and even its harbors to attack slave ships. In one instance, a British ship exchanged fire with a Brazilian fort. In the face of these tensions, Brazil knew that it could not afford to go to war with Britain. In addition, popular sentiment against the slave trade in Brazil was growing. The Brazilian government decided to put an end to the slave trade. In September 1850, new legislation outlawing the slave trade was enacted, and the Brazilian government began to enforce it. As a result, the Brazilian slave trade declined, and despite some illegal slavers that continued to operate, the trade came to an end in the mid-1850s, although slavery itself was not abolished in Brazil until 1888.

The current official name is National Kandawgyi Garden. History Map of the gardens It was first established in 1915 as the Maymyo Botanical Gardens by Alex Roger, a Forest Officer. The original site was , and was modelled after the Kew Gardens of England with the help of an amateur gardener called Lady Cuffe. In 1917, the government granted it official recognition, and in 1924, the site was declared a Government Botanical Reserve. On 1 December 1942, the Ministry of Forestry designated the Botanical Gardens a \\"protected forest area\\". On 1 December 2000, Sr Gen Than Shwe renamed it \\"Kandawgyi National Gardens\\". It has been used to promote extensive ecotourism in Burma. Flora and fauna Terraced gardens at the entrance of the Gardens Takin at Kandawgyi The Botanical Gardens has 514 species of indigenous trees and 74 foreign species, 75 species of bamboo, and 75 species of crotons. Of the 300 species of indigenous orchids, 178 were already collected in 1942. There are 25 rose species, and 6 land lily species. Medicinal plants for traditional medicines are also grown. The National Botanical Gardens is managed by the Ministry of Forestry. Forty two acres of the site are a protected forest area. The gardens are popular among tourists, who enjoy the rolling lawns and Alpine landscape reminiscent of those in England. Endangered wild animals are also kept in the National Kandawgyi Botanical Gardens, including Eld's deer, Burmese star tortoise, takin, hog deer, but there are also pheasant and water fowl. It has collaborated with the UK based Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) to conserve the indigenous orchids in their natural habitat. The Botanical Gardens has three museums. The Fossils Museum houses fossils of mammals, reptiles, and invertebrates, and the Petrified Wood Museum displays fossils of plants, colorful stones, toddy-palm roots, as well as things made from fossils of plants. The Butterfly Museum has various species of butterflies from Nepal, Taiwan, South America, Japan and South East Asia. Special events Celebrations of the Gardens' Diamond Jubilee were held from 14 December 2006 to 13 January 2007. Kandawgyi has expanded in recent years and reached its current size in 2000. An annual flower festival has been held in December since 2006. The 5 day event this year had over 7 million flowers of 16 local and over 70 foreign species on display. Number of visitors has averaged 400,000 since it was reopened in 2001.
