He is internationally known for his contributions to engineering, geology and building research and standardization. He is credited with the establishment of co-operation among Canadian geotechnical engineers, geologists and pedologists. Life Legget was born in Liverpool, England, to Donald Thompson Legget and his wife Mary, both of whom were of Scottish descent. He was educated at the Merchant Taylors' Boys' School, Crosby. He studied Civil Engineering and obtained a BEng (Hons) in 1925, and MEng 1927, from the University of Liverpool. He was initially employed as an engineer on the Lochaber Water Power Scheme in Scotland. He then emigrated to Canada in 1929, working for the Power Corporation of Canada.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary- robert-legget-1434265.html In 1936, he began teaching at Queen's University and the University of Toronto. He left teaching in 1947 to establish and serve as director of the National Research Council of Canada's new Division of Building Research. He held this position until he retired in 1969. Part of his legacy there was to establish a National Building Code that was respected throughout all of Canada, as opposed to the multitude of inconsistent local codes that were prevalent in 1947. Around 1945, after World War II, Leggat shaped the Environmental Conservation movement in Ontario by spearheading the Guelph Conference, the Ganaraska Study and the Conservation Authorities Act of Ontario (1946). He also was a founder, in 1962, of the Canadian Permafrost Conferences. He was the founding President of the Canadian Academy of Engineering. Between 1959 and 1960, Legget was the chairman of the Engineering Geology Division of the Geological Society of America (GSA). He served as GSA president in 1966.Eckel, Edwin, 1982, GSA Memoir 155, The Geological Society of America ‚Äî Life History of a Learned Society: Boulder, Colorado, Geological Society of America Memoir 155, 168 p., . In 1971 he received an honorary doctorate (DEng) from the University of Liverpool. After he retired, Dr. Legget wrote many books on the history of transportation in Canada including Ottawa Waterway: Gateway to A Continent, Rideau Waterway, Canals of Canada, The Seaway, and others, and he was a contributor to the Dictionary of Canadian Biography. Legget died in Ottawa at the age of 89. His wife, Mary Free, had died in 1984. They had one son.

Tradition und Innovation, 4. Aufl., Berlin 2001, S.539-550 Early precedents There is some evidence that some form of patent rights was recognized in Ancient Greece. In 500 BCE, in the Greek city of Sybaris (located in what is now southern Italy), \\"encouragement was held out to all who should discover any new refinement in luxury, the profits arising from which were secured to the inventor by patent for the space of a year.\\"Charles Anthon, A Classical Dictionary: Containing An Account of the Principal Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors, And Intended To Elucidate All The Important Points Connected With The Geography, History, Biography, Mythology, And Fine Arts Of The Greeks And Romans Together With An Account Of Coins, Weights, And Measures, With Tabular Values Of The Same, Harper & Bros, 1841, page 1273. Athenaeus, writing in the third century CE, cites Phylarchus in saying that in Sybaris exclusive rights were granted for one year to creators of unique culinary dishes.Phylarchus of Naucratis, \\"The Deipnosophists, or, Banquet of the Learned of Athen√¶us\\", Translated from Ancient Greek by H.Bohn 12:20, p.835 In England, grants in the form of letters patent were issued by the sovereign to inventors who petitioned and were approved: a grant of 1331 to John Kempe and his Company is the earliest authenticated instance of a royal grant made with the avowed purpose of instructing the English in a new industry.Terrell on Patents, 8th edition edited by J R Jones, London (Sweet & Maxwell) 1934.E Wyndham Hulme, The History of the Patent System under the Prerogative and at Common Law, Law Quarterly Review, vol.46 (1896), pp.141-154. These letters patent provided the recipient with a monopoly to produce particular goods or provide particular services. Another early example of such letters patent was a grant by Henry VI in 1449 to John of Utynam, a Flemish man, for a twenty-year monopoly for his invention. The first Italian patent was awarded by the Republic of Florence in 1421.Terence Kealey, The Economic Laws of Scientific Research, St. Martin's Press, 1996Gregory A Stobbs, Software Patents, Aspen Publishers, 2000, , page 3. The Florentine architect Filippo Brunelleschi received a three-year patent for a barge with hoisting gear, that carried marble along the Arno River in 1421.Christine MacLeod, Inventing the Industrial Revolution: The English Patent System, 1660-1800, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , , page 11. Development of the modern patent system Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers. The period of protection was 10 years. These were mostly in the field of glass making. As Venetians emigrated, they sought similar patent protection in their new homes. This led to the diffusion of patent systems to other countries.M. Frumkin, \\"The Origin of Patents\\", Journal of the Patent Office Society, March 1945, Vol. XXVII, No. 3, pp 143 et Seq. The Venetian Patent Statute, issued by the Senate of Venice in 1474, and one of the earliest patent systems in the world. King Henry II of France introduced the concept of publishing the description of an invention in a patent in 1555. The first patent \\"specification\\" was to inventor Abel Foullon for \\"Usaige & Description de l'holmetre\\", (a type of rangefinder.) Publication was delayed until after the patent expired in 1561. Patents were granted by the monarchy and by other institutions like the \\"Maison du Roi\\" and the Parliament of Paris. The novelty of the invention was examined by the French Academy of Sciences.Nowotarski, Bakos, ‚ÄúA Short History of Private Patent Examination‚Äù, Insurance IP Bulletin Oct. 2009 Digests were published irregularly starting in 1729 with delays of up to 60 years. Examinations were generally done in secret with no requirement to publish a description of the invention. Actual use of the invention was deemed adequate disclosure to the public.Frank D. Prager, ‚ÄúProposals for the Patent Act of 1790\\", Journal of the Patent and Trademark Office Society, March 1954, vol XXXVI, No. 3, pp 157 et Seq., citing J. Isore in Revue Historique de Droit Francais, 1937 pp. 117 et Seq. The English patent system evolved from its early medieval origins into the first modern patent system that recognised intellectual property in order to stimulate invention; this was the crucial legal foundation upon which the Industrial Revolution could emerge and flourish.; By the 16th century, the English Crown would habitually grant letters patent for monopolies to favoured persons (or people who were prepared to pay for them). Blackstone (same reference) also explains how \\"letters patent\\" (Latin literae patentes, \\"letters that lie open\\") were so called because the seal hung from the foot of the document: they were addressed \\"To all to whom these presents shall come\\" and could be read without breaking the seal, as opposed to \\"letters close\\", addressed to a particular person who had to break the seal to read them. This power was used to raise money for the Crown, and was widely abused, as the Crown granted patents in respect of all sorts of common goods (salt, for example). Consequently, the Court began to limit the circumstances in which they could be granted. After public outcry, James I of England was forced to revoke all existing monopolies and declare that they were only to be used for \\"projects of new invention\\". This was incorporated into the 1624 Statute of Monopolies in which Parliament restricted the Crown's power explicitly so that the King could only issue letters patent to the inventors or introducers of original inventions for a fixed number of years. It also voided all existing monopolies and dispensations with the exception of: :...the sole working or making of any manner of new manufactures within this realm to the true and first inventor and inventors of such manufactures which others at the time of making such letters patent and grants shall not use... The Statute became the foundation for later developments in patent law in England and elsewhere. James Puckle's 1718 early autocannon was one of the first inventions required to provide a specification for a patent. Important developments in patent law emerged during the 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification of the principles of operation of the invention for public access. Patenting medicines was particular popular in the mid-eighteenth century and then declined.Alan Mackintosh, Authority and Ownership: the growth and wilting of medicine patenting in Georgian England, British Journal for the History of Science 2016, DOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007087416001114 Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established the principles that patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented. This legal system became the foundation for patent law in countries with a common law heritage, including the United States, New Zealand and Australia. In the Thirteen Colonies, inventors could obtain patents through petition to a given colony's legislature. In 1641, Samuel Winslow was granted the first patent in North America by the Massachusetts General Court for a new process for making salt.James W. Cortada, \\"Rise of the knowledge worker, Volume 8 of Resources for the knowledge-based economy\\", Knowledge Reader Series, Butterworth- Heinemann, 1998, p. 141, , . Towards the end of the 18th century, and influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege. A negative aspect of the patent law also emerged in this period - the abuse of patent privilege to monopolise the market and prevent improvement from other inventors. A notable example of this was the behaviour of Boulton & Watt in hounding their competitors such as Richard Trevithick through the courts, and preventing their improvements to the steam engine from being realised until their patent expired. Consolidation The modern French patent system was created during the Revolution in 1791. Patents were granted without examination since inventor's right was considered as a natural one. Patent costs were very high (from 500 to 1500 francs). Importation patents protected new devices coming from foreign countries. The patent law was revised in 1844 - patent cost was lowered and importation patents were abolished. The revision saw the introduction of the Brevet√© SGDG, which excluded any guarantees that the patented item would actually satisfy its specification. Samuel Hopkins in 1790. The Patent and Copyright Clause of the United States Constitution was proposed in 1787 by James Madison and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. In Federalist No. 43, Madison wrote, \\"The utility of the clause will scarcely be questioned. The copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged, in Great Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors. The public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of the individuals.\\" The first Patent Act of the U.S. Congress was passed on April 10, 1790, titled \\"An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts.\\"Online at Library of Congress: \\"A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875\\": First Congress, Session II, chapter VII, 1790: \\"An Act to promote the progress of useful Arts\\". The first patent was granted on July 31, 1790 to Samuel Hopkins for a method of producing potash (potassium carbonate). The earliest law required that a working model of each invention be submitted with the application. Patent applications were examined to determine if an inventor was entitled to the grant of a patent. The requirement for a working model was eventually dropped. In 1793,Chap.

In 1870 Congress passed a law which mainly reorganized and reenacted existing law, but also made some important changes, such as giving the commissioner of patents the authority to draft rules and regulations for the Patent Office.Chap.CCXXX. 16 Stat. 198 from \\"A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875\\".

Criticism Under the influence of the ascendant economic philosophy of free trade economics in England, the patent law began to be criticised in the 1850s as obstructing research and benefiting the few at the expense of public good.Johns, Adrian: Piracy. The Intellectual Property Wars from Gutenberg to Gates. The University of Chicago Press, 2009, , p.247 The campaign against patenting expanded to target copyright too and, in the judgment of historian Adrian Johns, \\"remains to this day the strongest [campaign] ever undertaken against intellectual property\\", coming close to abolishing patents. Its most prominent activists - Isambard Kingdom Brunel, William Robert Grove, William Armstrong and Robert A. MacFie - were inventors and entrepreneurs, and it was also supported by radical laissez-faire economists (The Economist published anti-patent views), law scholars, scientists (who were concerned that patents were obstructing research) and manufacturers.Johns, Adrian: Piracy, p. 249, 267, 270 Johns summarizes some of their main arguments as follows:Johns, Adrian: Piracy, p. 273, citing W.R. Grove: Suggestions for Improvements in the Administration of the Patent Law, The Jurist n.s. 6 (January 28, 1860) 19-25 (online copy at Google Books), and B. Sherman, L. Bently: The Making of Modern Intellectual Property Law (CUP 1999), 50-56 :[Patents] projected an artificial idol of the single inventor, radically denigrated the role of the intellectual commons, and blocked a path to this commons for other citizens ‚Äî citizens who were all, on this account, potential inventors too. [...] Patentees were the equivalent of squatters on public land ‚Äî or better, of uncouth market traders who planted their barrows in the middle of the highway and barred the way of the people. Similar debates took place during that time in other European countries such as France, Prussia, Switzerland and the Netherlands.Johns, Adrian: Piracy, p. 248 Based on the criticism of patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade, the Netherlands abolished patents in 1869 (having established them in 1817), and did not reintroduce them until 1912.Chang, Ha-Joon. \\"Kicking Away the Ladder: How the Economic and Intellectual Histories of Capitalism Have Been Re-Written to Justify Neo-Liberal Capitalism\\". Post-Autistic Economics Review. 4 September 2002: Issue 15, Article 3. Retrieved on 8 October 2008. In Switzerland, criticism of patents delayed the introduction of patent laws until 1907. In England, despite much public debate, the system wasn't abolished - it was reformed with the Patent Law Amendment Act of 1852. This simplified procedure for obtaining patents, reduced fees and created one office for the entire United Kingdom, instead of different systems for England and Wales and Scotland. In France as well, a similar controversy erupted in the 1860s and reforms were made.Gabriel Galvez-Behar, La R√©publique des inventeurs.

He served four years in the British Army during the war, and upon his return to civilian life thought it too late to continue his medical studies. He began his movie career at Denham Studios, eventually becoming an assistant film editor beginning with Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948). His editing work included many films directed by his older brother, Ralph Thomas. His own directorial debut was the short film Circus Friends (1956), produced by the Children's Film Foundation. His first feature was the thriller Time Lock the following year. Beginning with the farcical military comedy Carry On Sergeant (1958), Thomas directed all 30 films in the Carry On series of British comedies, produced by Peter Rogers, ending with Carry On Emmannuelle (1978) and the belated Carry On Columbus (1992). Additionally, he directed the framing sequences of the compilation film That's Carry On! (1977). Other works as director include the comedy Please Turn Over (1959) and a drama of post-war Austria, The Second Victory (1986). Personal life Thomas was married, and the couple had three daughters.

Optimum-sized objects permit the hand to wrap around a cylindrical shape with a diameter from one to three inches. Stair rails are an example of where shape and diameter are critical for proper grip in case of a fall. Other grip strengths that have been studied are the hammer and other hand tools. In applications of grip strength, the wrist must be in a neutral position to avoid developing cumulative trauma disorders (CTDs). Grip strength is a general term also used to refer to the physical strength of an animal and, for athletes, to the muscular power and force that can be generated with the hands. In athletics, grip strength is critical for rock climbers and is an important factor in strongman competitions and weight lifting. Grip strength training is also a major feature in martial arts and can be useful in various professions where people must work with their hands. Types of grip The human hand can be used to grip objects in several different positions. These different positions require different types of grip strength which are typically quantified based on the way the hand is being used. The crush grip is what is most commonly thought of as \\"grip\\". It involves a handshake-type grip, where the object being gripped rests firmly against the palm and all fingers. A strong crush grip is useful in bone- crushing handshakes or for breaking objects with pressure. In a pinch grip, the fingers are on one side of an object, and the thumb is on the other. Typically, an object lifted in a pinch grip does not touch the palm. This is generally considered a weaker grip position. The pinch grip is used when grabbing something like a weight plate or lifting a sheet of plywood by the top edge. A support grip typically involves holding something, such as the handle of a bucket, for a long time. This type of strength is epitomized by the Farmer's walk competitive event, where the bucket is filled with sand or water, and carried over a long distance. A great deal of muscular endurance is necessary to have a good carrying grip. =Normative data= There has been extensive medical and ergonomic research looking at grip strength. This has led to the generation of normative data. The average for grip strength of men is higher than that of women. The grip strength of 90% of women is lower than that of 95% of men. Averages also exist for different types of grip in different positions.Effects of interface factors on the handgrip and pinchgrip force exertion capabilities, muscular contraction speed and endurance Winson W.S. LO, Alan H.S. CHAN, Michael K.H. LEUNG Grip strength increases or decreases depending on the arm position at which the grip strength is being measured. A person's grip strength usually results in having the strongest grip strength when their arm is extended at 90¬∞ before their body, as opposed to the other extreme arm positions, rested at one's side or held straight up above one's head. Grip strength is not optimal if one's arm is extended backwards beyond the resting position at the body's sides. It can be concluded that grip strength is affected via the different arm muscles and their ability to contract. =In medicine= Grip strength is often used in medicine as a specific type of hand strength. The purpose of this testing is diverse, including to diagnose diseases, to evaluate and compare treatments, to document progression of muscle strength, and to provide feedback during the rehabilitation process as a measure indicating the level of hand function. For example, it is used to indicate changes in hand strength after hand surgery or after a rehabilitation program. By asking subjects to maintain a maximum contraction for longer periods, it can be used as a measure of fatigue. It is also able to predict a decline in function in old age. Since the above- mentioned grips involve the action of a large number of different joints and muscle groups, grip strength is not always very sensitive to measure individual muscle groups in medicine. For this purpose, dynamometers have been developed that provide more specific information on individual muscles in the hand such as the Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM).RIHM In medicine, doctors sometimes use grip strength to test a patient's mentality, as grip strength directly correlates to mental state.Poitras, Colin. Grip Strength is good indicator of overall health. 6 June 2011. https://today.uconn.edu/2011/06/grip-strength-is-good-indicator-of-overall- health/#. 24 September 2018. Grip strength is also used to measure the degree of rehabilitation from injuries; all other things being equal, it will vary with general condition. Additionally, grip strength can be used to determine a patient's physical stability. Measuring this in intervals allows a doctor to determine if a patient is making progress or if different methods need to be used. There is a direct correlation between grip strength of older people and their overall body strength.Shea, Jason. THE IMPORTANCE OF GRIP. 11 2014. https://www.onekidsplace.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Importance-of-grip- strength.pdf. 24 September 2018. This correlation helps doctors with treating the elderly a lot, because it allows doctors to see how well an elderly person is functioning. Strengthening the grip strength helps players recover from sport injuries such as tennis elbow. =In sports= Hand grip is an important, though often overlooked, component of strength in sports. However, the grip strength is most often a secondary or auxiliary function of the sport. Sports in which grip strength are included within the secondary focus include the following: movement-based climbing, calisthenics, gymnastics, pole dancing, horse racing, powerlifting or professional arm-wrestling; ball-based baseball, gridiron football, rugby, canoe polo, badminton or tennis; and combat sports such as brazilian jiu-jitsu, boxing, fencing, judo or wrestling. In sports, hand grip strength is a major factor in a player's strength, determining how easily a ball can be caught or how effectively equipment can be used. Hand grip strength is directly linked to hand-eye coordination: when a person is looking at the thing they are gripping, hand grip strength intensifies because of this synchronization.Pipal, Bhanu Priya. Correlation between Hand Grip Strength and Hand. March 2017. https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v6i3/ART20171552.pdf. 24 September 2018. Hand grip strength is very important when it comes to sports.Iermakov SS, Podrigalo LV, Jagie≈Ç≈Ço W. \\" Hand-grip strength as an indicator for predicting the success in martial arts athletes.\\" Arch Budo (2016): 179-186. Volume 12. Before a player begins playing a hand grip strength test is important for determining a player's workout. Hand grip strength determines a player's readiness for sports. In golf, hand grip strength is used to control the power a golfer hits a golf ball. The angle at which a golfer hits the ball determines how far the ball goes. ... In football, the quarterback uses hand grip strength to throw accurate passers to receivers. The receivers use hand grip strength to catch and maintain control of the football. ... In hockey, hand grip strength is used to angle the shot of the puck, whether they are passing the puck or shooting for a goal. Hand grip strength is essential for the execution of skills in hockey.A Brief Review of Handgrip Strength and Sport Performance. 31 July 2018. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319172114_A_Brief_Review_of_Handgrip_Strength_and_Sport_Performance. 24 September 2018. In martial arts, hand grip strength is a key use in mastering techniques. [2] Hand grip strength determines the success of arm functionality, such as speed and precision. =As a separate discipline= From their beginnings as odd performances at fairs and circuses, grip feats have recently gained acceptance as a sport in their own right, with competitions being held with increasing regularity. Events include one-arm deadlift, nail bending, the closing of torsion spring hand grippers, v-bar (vertical bar) lifting, and standardized pinch apparatuses. Other common events may include Rolling Thunder lifts, thickbar deadlifts, and \\"Blob\\" lifting. The major contests are: *The King Kong Grip Challenge *North American Gripsport Championship *World's Strongest Hands *A Gripmas Carol *Champion of Champions *European Grip Championships *Mighty Mitts *Britain's Strongest Hands *British Grip Championships *M√ºnsterland Grip Challenge *Global Grip Challenge *Loddekopinge Grip Challenge *Australian Grip Championships *German Grip Championships *Backyard Bastard Bash *Metroflex Mayhem at Metroflex *The National Capital Grip Championship *The South Jersey Grip Contest *The Southern Squeeze Top 3 results back to 1955 =Feats of strength= Although grip strength lends itself to impromptu performances that might feature a unique implement or cater to a particular individual or a small group, performances on standardized, widely available tests carry more weight. One such feat involving world class grip strength is officially closing a No. 3 Captains of Crush Gripper, first accomplished by Richard Sorin in 1991.http://www.ironmind.com/ironmind/opencms/Main/captainsofcrush3.html Card tearing is a traditional feat of grip and lower arm strength that has a rich history,Willoughby, David P. The Super Athletes. A.S.

IronMind Enterprises, Inc.: Nevada City, California: 2002 Training methods Wrist straps allow lifting heavier weights without having the grip strength that would be required otherwise. Grip strength training requires a different type of training regimen than other muscular training. The reasons are primarily based on the interplay of the tendons and muscles and the lack of \\"down time\\" or rest that most people's hands get. It is generally considered that all aspects of the hand must be exercised to produce a healthy and strong hand. Only working on closing grip will cause an imbalance between closing and opening (antagonist) muscles, and can lead to problems such as tendinitis and carpal tunnel syndrome. =For closing grip= *Thick bar and Thick Griphttp://www.ironbullstrength.com work on a two-inch or thicker bar‚Äîsuch as deadlifts, pullups, and the farmers walk‚Äîtrains the support grip. *Grippers train the crushing grip. *Plate pinches grabbing plates smooth side out and pinching them. *Sledgehammer lever ‚Äî levering a sledgehammer using the wrists to train fingers and wrists. *Plate curls/wrist curls ‚Äî grabbing a plate and doing wrist curls or regular curls with them with the fingers on the bottom and thumb on top, trains the wrists and fingers and thumb for pinch grip. *Blockweights ‚Äî cut off ends of hex dumbbells that are grasped in a pinch grip fashion from different sides of the blockweight with one end grasped by fingers and other by thumb; trained with either singles, timed holds, or tosses from hand to hand. *Hangboard can be used for training the full-crimp grip, half-crimp grip and open hand grip, required in climbing.Banaszczyk J., \\"Steve Bechtel‚Äôs 3-6-9 Ladders hangboard finger strength training.\\" StrengthClimbing.com (2019): May 18, 2019. https://strengthclimbing.com/steve- bechtels-3-6-9-ladders/ =For opening grip= *Extensors; these are the muscles that oppose the flexors of the hands and should be trained to achieve a good balance between opposing muscle groups; extensor muscles are key in grip because they must contract aggressively to support finger flexion. Shoving your hand in something like rice and extending it, or placing something such as rocks in a coffee can, putting your hand in there, and extending it to pick up the coffee can, are ways of training your hand extensors. *Some grip companies, such as IronMind Enterprises Inc., sell high- resistance rubber bands which work the extensor grip. Another option, is a weight based machine like \\"The Gripper\\" offered by Fitness Specialties U.S.A.. This type of plate loaded machine will not only strengthen your grip but also your forearm strength. *As finger flexor/extensors serve a function as wrist flexor/extensors, doing wrist extension exercises (sometimes called \\"reverse wrist curls\\") would also stimulate the finger extensor fibers. *Doing fist pushups on the backside of the first fingerbone would increasingly put pressure on the extensor muscles as weight was shifted from knuckle-end to the further joint. When in a tight fist, the flat of the fingernails can dig into the palm and push the skin down to create a bridge to stabilize the first structure and prevent hyperflexion of the knuckle joints (which can be observed by doing pushups with the entire backside of the fingers flat on the ground, fingers pointing towards the opposite hand). =For stabilization= *Fingertip pushups would utilize both opening and closing grip muscles to keep the finger from sliding, as well as more focused bone density in the hand, though they are very strenuous and dangerous unless approached progressively. *Hand stands free from a wall with fingers pointing behind would use gripping stretching to stabilize the hand to prevent the body from falling towards the front, and extensor muscles to prevent the body from falling towards the back. *Metal-rod exercises strengthen the grip indirectly but very effectively through strength training using a metal rod or pole.

Early life and career He was born in May 1913 in Shyamagram in East Bengal (now Bangladesh).\\"Haridas Chaudhury\\" in He studied at the Scottish Church College and later at the University of Calcutta from where he earned his doctorate in Indian philosophy. He became a professor and later the chair of philosophy at the Krishnagar College, then a constituent college of the University of Calcutta. California Institute of Integral Studies In 1951, Chaudhuri was invited by Frederic Spiegelberg of Stanford University to join the staff of the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco, having been recommended for that post by Sri Aurobindo during the final year of Aurobindo's life. Other accounts have indicated that Chaudhuri was recommended for the job by K.D. Sethna, an eminent intellectual living at Aurobindo's ashram, based in part on the fact that Chaudhuri was an active devotee of Sri Aurobindo. He accepted the invitation, eager to implement in a Western educational institution the integral approach to education that he had developed as a student of Sri Aurobindo. Soon after his arrival in San Francisco, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship (CIF), from which emerged an educational branch later to become California Institute of Integral Studies. Over the past 30 years, the Institute's original emphasis on Asian religions and cultures evolved to include comparative and cross-cultural studies in philosophy, religion, psychology, counseling, cultural anthropology, organizational studies, health studies, and the arts. Integral psychology Chaudhuri was the first to publish in the West on integral psychology, during the 1970s. His version of integral psychology has almost nothing in common with that of Ken Wilber, who has written a book of the same name. Bahman Shirazi of the California Institute of Integral Studies has defined integral psychology as \\"a psychological system concerned with exploring and understanding the totality of the human phenomenon....(which) at its breadth, covers the entire body- mind-psyche-spirit spectrum, while at its depth...encompasses the previously explored unconscious and the conscious dimensions of the psyche, as well as the supra-conscious dimension traditionally excluded from psychological inquiry\\". (Shirazi 2001) In a paper on the subject he reviews Indra Sen's, Chaudhuri's, and Wilber's definitions, as well as developing the ideas of Chaudhuri.

Its areas of focus include immigration, family law, employment law, tenant and landlord issues, wills, trusts and intellectual property. Even though Nolo encourages consumers and small business owners to handle their own legal matters when it is reasonably feasible to do so, the company recommends getting professional legal help for disputable or difficult matters. The company was founded in an attic in 1971 by Ralph Warner (a graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt School of Law) and family law attorney Ed Sherman. The company's logo shows the scales of justice tilted in favor of the reader, and includes the motto \\"LAW for ALL.\\" History In 1971 Ed Sherman wrote How to Do Your Own Divorce in California. He and Ralph Warner discovered that established publishers wouldn't publish the book because they feared being prosecuted for practicing law without a licence. In response Sherman and Warner created Nolo Press and published it themselves. They then started publishing additional do-it-yourself legal guides under the Nolo Press name. The Latin word \\"nolo\\" in the original company name (\\"Nolo Press\\") could be taken to mean \\"I would prefer not to.\\" Warner and Sherman thought this name was appropriate since they had only started a publishing business themselves after their first do-it-yourself guide was turned down by established publishers. In 2006, Nolo began publishing a directory of attorneys, which is asserted to operate on the principle that both participating lawyers and consumers are better served by a relatively short list of qualified attorneys under each category (business law, real estate, etc.), with much information for side-by-side comparisons. In 2006 Nolo retired its unofficial shark mascot on the company's 35th anniversary. Some older Nolo publications had featured the shark wearing a necktie and carrying a briefcase ‚Äì showing the company's fondness for poking fun at their fellow members of the legal profession. This mascot was often accompanied by the motto \\"Don't feed the lawyers. Just say Nolo.\\" In 2011, the company was purchased by Internet Brands, Inc. Ed Sherman founded his own legal publishing business, Nolo Press Occidental, a separate company from Nolo.Nolo Press Occidental corporate history webpage Products and services Since its inception in the early 1970s, Nolo's primary focus has been publishing self-help legal guides designed to assist anyone in finding plain-language answers to common legal questions. The company is also the creator of Quicken WillMaker software, which allows individuals to create do-it-yourself wills, powers of attorney and other estate planning documents. Complaints from lawyers Although the company's products conspicuously recommend the reader should engage a lawyer for difficult or contended matters, the company has nevertheless drawn the ire of some legal organizations. Publication of Nolo's first book, How to Do Your Own Divorce in California, was condemned by the Sacramento Bar Association, which led to a huge increase in its sales.Legal Affairs magazine, September 2003 In 1997, the Texas Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee (a committee of the Texas Supreme Court) opened investigations on Nolo and similar publishers, inquiring as to whether their publications constituted practicing law without a license. Saying that the investigation was \\"the first step toward widespread state censorship\\", Nolo sued, seeking a declaratory judgment that its publications were legal. It was joined in the action by the American Association of Law Libraries and the Texas Library Association. In response, the Texas Legislature enacted HR 1507, which expressly exempted websites and textbooks from accusations of practicing law without a license, providing they \\"clearly and conspicuously state that the products are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney\\".Texas HR 1507 In light of this, the court committee dropped its contest of Nolo's suit.

He fought in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and on the Union side of the American Civil War, rising to the rank of major general. He commanded a division at the Battle of Shiloh, which suffered heavy casualties while defending what became known as the Hornet's Nest from continued Confederate assaults, and he eventually surrendered his division. He was criticized by some for his conduct in that battle. After his exchange, he continued to serve in the army until his resignation in 1863. He spent much of his remaining life practising as a lawyer and as a politician in the Republican Party. Early life, marriages and family Benjamin M. Prentiss was born in Belleville, Virginia. He was a direct descendant of Valentine Prentice, who immigrated from England in 1631. His early childhood was spent in Virginia until his family joined the migration and moved near Hannibal, Missouri. They then moved to Quincy, Illinois, where Prentiss made his home until 1879. He then moved to Missouri. In his early life, Benjamin Prentiss was a rope-maker and served as an auctioneer. On March 29, 1838, he married Margaret Ann Sodowsky; they had seven children before she died in 1860. In 1862, he married Mary Worthington Whitney, who bore him five more children.The History & Genealogy of the Prentice, Prentis & Prentiss Families in New England from 1631 - 1883, Linus Joseph Dewald, based on the 1883 Edition by CJF Binney Civil War Prentiss ran unsuccessfully for United States Congress in 1860. At the beginning of the American Civil War he defended railroad lines in Missouri until ordered to command a division under Ulysses S. Grant. Early in the morning, an officer under his command, Colonel Everett Peabody, sent out a 250-man patrol which made contact with the advancing Confederate army, providing the Union army with critical early warning of the impending attack. Prentiss was initially outraged with Peabody for sending out a patrol without his authorization, but soon realized he was facing an on oncoming attack by an entire Confederate army and rushed to prepare his men for defense. His division was the first one attacked at the Battle of Shiloh and suffered greatly during the opening hours of that battle. Brigadier General Prentiss reformed his command with reinforcements under the command General W. H. L. Wallace and put up a spirited fight in the \\"Hornet's Nest\\". Prentiss took full command of the position after Wallace was fatally wounded and eventually surrendered the Hornet's Nest along with 2,200 other Union soldiers. He surrendered his sword to Lt. Colonel Francis Marion Walker of the 19th Tennessee Infantry. After the battle he was considered a hero, having held off the Confederate States Army long enough to allow General Grant to organize a counterattack and win the battle. Grant would later play down Benjamin Prentiss' role in the victory, possibly because of mutual dislike between the two generals.Daniel, p. 109. However, Grant said in his memoirs \\"Prentiss' command was gone as a division, many of its members having been killed, wounded or captured; but it had rendered valiant services before its final dispersal, and had contributed a good share to the defense of Shiloh\\". Prentiss' own after-action report did not mention the aid of Wallace's troops, and barely made any mention of Peabody, who was also killed in action during the battle.https://www.civilwar.org/learn/articles/battle-shiloh-shattering- myths After being released as part of a prisoner exchange in October the same year, Prentiss was promoted to major general and served on the court-martial board that convicted Fitz John Porter. His dissenting voice in the final vote damaged his political clout. Prentiss was sent to Arkansas and won the Battle of Helena on July 4, 1863. In 1863, he resigned to tend to his family. Historian Ezra J. Warner speculated that Prentiss felt that he was being shelved after having proved his abilities at Shiloh and Helena.Warner, p. 386. Post-Civil War career After the Civil War, Prentiss became a lawyer. He was later appointed as postmaster of Bethany, Missouri,Eicher, p. 438. by President Benjamin Harrison and was re-appointed by President William McKinley. He was a leader in the Republican Party of Missouri. He died on February 8, 1901 in Bethany at age 81. He is buried there in Miriam Cemetery, Harrison County, Missouri.

The division's first battles were in Ukraine in April 1944. Afterwards, the unit was then transferred to the west, where it fought the Allies in France and at Arnhem. The division was moved to Pomerania, then fought south east of Berlin in the Lusatian area until the end of the war. History The division received the honor title Frundsberg after the 16th Century German commander Georg von Frundsberg. The division was mainly formed from conscripts. It first saw action at Tarnopol in April 1944 and later took part in the relief of the German troops cut off in the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket. It was then sent to Normandy to counter the Allied landings, where, along with the SS Division Hohenstaufen, it took part in fighting against the Allied Operation Epsom.They spent the rest of July repulsing British attacks against Hill 112 and Hill 113, most notably during Operation Jupiter. After two weeks of fighting in August against the British during Operation Bluecoat and the Americans at Domfront the division was like many other units encircled at Falaise. They were intended to take part in the counterattack conducted by the II. SS-Panzerkorps but due to the confusion and chaos in the pocket the attack broke down. SS-Panzer-Grenadier-Regiment 21 struck towards St. Lambert but got repulsed. After that the planned attack of the Frundsberg was abandoned and they were ordered to break out between St. Lambert and Chambois. The division suffered heavy casualties and retreated into Belgium before being sent to be reconstituted near Arnhem, where it soon fought the Allied airborne troops during Operation Market Garden at Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, when together with the 9th SS Panzer division it constituted the II SS Panzer Corps.http://www.defendingarnhem.com/Frundsberg.htm After rebuilding, it fought in the Alsace in January 1945. It was then sent to the Eastern Front, where it fought against the Red Army in Pomerania and then Saxony. Encircled in the Halbe Pocket, the division effected a breakout and retreated through Moritzburg, before reaching the area of Teplice in Czechoslovakia, where the division surrendered to the US Army at the end of the war.Georg Tessin, Verb√§nde und Truppen der deutschen Wehrmacht und Waffen-SS, Vol. III, p. 188, Osnabr√ºck: Biblio Verlag, 1974 G√ºnter Grass German writer and Nobel laureate G√ºnter Grass was an assistant tank gunner with the SS division at the age of 17 in November 1944.

He is best known for his involvement in the making of the Carry On series of films. Life and career Rogers began his career as a journalist for his local paper, before graduating to scriptwriting religious informational films. He progressed to film production, working with director Gerald Thomas, the first work being a production for the Children's Film Foundation. Rogers is best known as producer of the Carry On series of British comedy films, beginning with Carry On Sergeant in 1958. There were 31 films in all. Rogers had also been linked with a further instalment, Carry On London, which has been in pre-production for several years, but since his death seems unlikely to be made. The majority of Rogers' work, including all the Carry On films, were made at Pinewood Studios in Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire, England. His other credits included Appointment with Venus starring David Niven, and Time Lock in which Sean Connery made one of his earliest film appearances. Rogers' other production ventures include the television series Ivanhoe with Roger Moore and the film adaptation of the long-running sitcom Bless This House with Carry On regular Sid James. His wife was the film producer Betty Box, responsible for the Doctor series of films. They did not have any children, but their godson was actor and theatre producer Marc Sinden (who appeared in Carry On Columbus), the son of Sir Donald Sinden, who starred for Betty Box in, amongst other films, Doctor in the House, Doctor at Large and Mad About Men. Peter and Betty lived for many years at a large home in Beaconsfield, \\"Drummers Yard\\", that had been purchased from the actor Dirk Bogarde. An authorized biography, Mr Carry On: The Life and Work of Peter Rogers (BBC) by Morris Bright and Robert Ross (author of The Carry On Companion and the Monty Python Encyclopedia) was published in 2000, with extensive input from Rogers. It attempted to defend him against charges that he exploited the cast of the Carry On films, by paying the lead actors an unchanged ¬£5,000 per film, from the first in 1958 to the penultimate movie. Rogers attended the 50th anniversary of the Carry On films held at Pinewood Studios in March 2008. He died on 14 April 2009, having been ill for several months.

When the CLR loads an assembly it will obtain evidence for the assembly and use this to identify the code group that the assembly belongs to. A code group contains a permission set (one or more permissions). Code that performs a privileged action will perform a code access demand which will cause the CLR to walk up the call stack and examine the permission set granted to the assembly of each method in the call stack. The code groups and permission sets are determined by the administrator of the machine who defines the security policy. Evidence Evidence can be any information associated with an assembly. The default evidences that are used by .NET code access security are: *Application directory: the directory in which an assembly resides. *Publisher: the assembly's publisher's digital signature (requires the assembly to be signed via Authenticode). *URL: the complete URL where the assembly was launched from *Site: the hostname of the URL/Remote Domain/VPN. *Zone: the security zone where the assembly resides *Hash: a cryptographic hash of the assembly, which identifies a specific version. *Strong Name: a combination of the assembly name, version and public key of the signing key used to sign the assembly. The signing key is not an X509 certificate, but a custom key pair generated by the strong naming tool, SN.EXE or by Visual Studio. A developer can use custom evidence (so-called assembly evidence) but this requires writing a security assembly and in version 1.1 of .NET this facility does not work. Evidence based on a hash of the assembly is easily obtained in code. For example, in C#, evidence may be obtained by the following code clause: this.GetType().Assembly.Evidence Policy A policy is a set of expressions that uses evidence to determine a code group membership. A code group gives a permission set for the assemblies within that group. There are four policies in .NET: *Enterprise: policy for a family of machines that are part of an Active Directory installation. *Machine: policy for the current machine. *User: policy for the logged on user. *AppDomain: policy for the executing application domain. The first three policies are stored in XML files and are administered through the .NET Configuration Tool 1.1 (mscorcfg.msc). The final policy is administered through code for the current application domain. Code access security will present an assembly's evidence to each policy and will then take the intersection (that is the permissions common to all the generated permission set) as the permissions granted to the assembly. By default, the Enterprise, User, and AppDomain policies give full trust (that is they allow all assemblies to have all permissions) and the Machine policy is more restrictive. Since the intersection is taken this means that the final permission set is determined by the Machine policy. Note that the policy system has been eliminated in .NET Framework 4.0.Summary of Changes in Code Access Security Code group Code groups associate a piece of evidence with a named permission set. The administrator uses the .NET Configuration Tool to specify a particular type of evidence (for example, Site) and a particular value for that evidence (for example, www.mysite.com) and then identifies the permission set that the code group will be granted. Demands Code that performs some privileged action will make a demand for one or more permissions. The demand makes the CLR walk the call stack and for each method the CLR will ensure that the demanded permissions are in the method's assembly's granted permissions. If the permission is not granted then a security exception is thrown. This prevents downloaded code from performing privileged actions. For example, if an assembly is downloaded from an untrusted site the assembly will not have any file IO permissions and so if this assembly attempts to access a file code access security will throw an exception preventing the call.

The pub derives its name from a gold-robbing farmer, William Davies (or Davis) who spent years plundering various sections of the country's main south-west turnpike road including this area before being hanged in 1689 at this location. Junction The junction was a fork with the London to Land's End turnpike road (now the A30 London Road), and the London to Portsmouth turnpike (now the A325 Portsmouth Road). The two main roads are mentioned in John Ogilby's Britannia, published in 1675, with the Land's End road described as \\"in general a very good Road with suitable Entertainment\\" and the Portsmouth Road as \\"A very good Road to Southampton, and thence to Salisbury indifferent\\" (the route to Southampton being roughly the A325 and part of what is now the A31). Until the establishment of Camberley in 1860, it crossed remote unpopulated heathland. In the stagecoach era, it was busy with traffic, and notorious for the poor quality of road and proliferation of highwaymen. The junction has been an important landmark and mentioned in early motoring itineraries. It was originally a simple fork in the road and was converted into the current roundabout layout in 1960. William Davies The highwayman William Davies (also recorded as \\"Davis\\") was born in Wrexham, Wales, before moving to Sodbury, Gloucestershire where he married and had 18 children. He targeted heaths across England from Putney near London to Cornwall for 40 years in the 17th century, taking significant gold from his victims. He plied the uninhabited main road across Bagshot/Frimley Heath. His identity was discovered since he was a Sodbury farmer bearing 18 children with his wife who paid \\"any considerable sum in gold\\". Davies was hung in chains on Bagshot Heath in December 1689. According to oral history Davies was hanged near the location of the pub, at the junction of London Road and Gibbett Lane. According to historian Jacqueline Simpson, this included speculation that he was hanged alive and starved to death, though this practice had been abolished by Elizabeth I a century earlier for being too barbaric. Pub View of the former pub from the A30 eastbound The original building was to the north of the London Road, and operated from the late 17th century as the Golden Farmer. It appeared under that name on early Ordnance Survey maps in the 19th century. The name \\"Golden Farmer\\" was originally associated with John Bennet, but became associated with Davies after being mentioned as such in Alexander Smith's The History of the Lives of the most Noted Highwaymen, published in 1714. A picture of Davies was painted and hung in the pub. The name was changed to \\"Jolly Farmer\\" in 1823. It moved to its current location inside the roundabout in 1879. During the 19th century, the pub was a rendezvous point for hunting around Bagshot Heath. H E Malden wrote the Victoria County History in 1911, finding little of economic productivity or architecture in Bagshot to record other than its coaching inns, stating \\"Thirty coaches a day passed through, and there were many inns, since closed...The later history is full of the exploits of highwaymen, who found the wild country hereabouts specially favourable for their purposes\\".'Parishes: Windlesham' A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 3, ed. H E Malden (London, 1911), pp. 376-378 In 1996, the pub closed and became a Mongolian barbecue. After this also closed, Burger King offered to buy the building, but their offer was rejected by Surrey Heath council after parents were concerned children from the nearby secondary school would try to cross the junction to reach the premises. Since 2003, the building has been used as an American discount golf store.

They have released eleven studio albums to date. Three of those, Indiscreet, Tough It Out and 2015's Heroes and Villains reached the UK Albums Chart, whilst five of the band's singles made inroads into the UK Singles Chart. Career FM was formed in the summer of 1984 in London. Comprising the ex-Samson pair of bassist Merv Goldsworthy and drummer Pete Jupp, the Overland brothers ‚Äì vocalist/guitarist Steve and lead guitarist Chris Overland (both formerly of Wildlife, where they played with future Ozzy, Johnny Hallyday and Vince Neil bassist Phil Soussan) and keyboardist Philip Manchester (of new wave band The Invaders, also known as Didge Digital), the band initially wrote six songs which by December 1984 had helped them secure a recording contract with the CBS/Portrait label. That same month the band set off on tour in Germany with Meat Loaf. The first UK public appearance of FM (not to be confused with the Canadian band of the same name) was on Valentine‚Äôs Day in 1985 at London's legendary Marquee Club. The debut album, Indiscreet followed and their debut single \\"Frozen Heart\\" was heard in many venues during 1986. FM hit the road in Europe supporting Tina Turner, Foreigner, Gary Moore, Status Quo and Magnum, also opening for REO Speedwagon at London‚Äôs Hammersmith Odeon. At the year's end they accepted a spot with Bon Jovi on the UK leg of their Slippery When Wet Tour. When CBS folded the Portrait label, FM switched to Epic. The Overland brothers went to the United States to write with Desmond Child, returning with the hard rock anthem \\"Bad Luck\\". Queensr√øche and Dokken producer Neil Kernon was engaged to oversee 1989‚Äôs Tough It Out. To promote Tough It Out, the band set out on a 42 date UK tour that saw them returning to the Hammersmith Odeon. Soon afterwards, Chris Overland decided to leave FM, his final performance taking place at the Town & Country Club. In his place, FM recruited Andy Barnett, a guitarist who had already been in a prototype line-up of the group, and had a co-writing credit for the Indiscreet song, \\"That Girl,\\" which was later covered by Iron Maiden as a B-side. His debut with the group was 1991's Takin‚Äô It To The Streets. FM moved to another record label, Music For Nations, and Didge Digital left in late 1991. A cover version of Marvin Gaye's \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\" was not a hit, but was followed by their next album, Aphrodisiac. They undertook a string of acoustic concerts in the winter of 1992. With Europe and the Far East markets opening up for FM, a full-time keyboard appointment was made with Jem Davis (former Tobruk and UFO), joining the band. The arrangement was short-lived. After the release of Dead Man's Shoes in 1995, the band split up. At Nottingham's Rock City venue on 27 October 2007 however, FM played together again in public for the first time in twelve years, headlining the sold-out Firefest festival. The reaction the band received to this one-off appearance led to the swift decision to make the reunion permanent. Guitarist Andy Barnett could not commit to long-term plans however and the band were disappointed to accept his resignation. At Steve Overland's suggestion Jim Kirkpatrick was recruited and he made his live debut with FM at a low-key show at Winstanley College (Wigan, UK) on 19 March 2009, followed by a more public appearance when FM headlined Firefest for a second time on October 2009. To coincide with this festival appearance FM released the new single \\"Wildside\\" as part of an EP containing new recordings and live tracks. For the first time new recruit Jim Kirkpatrick was featured on record. The single was a taster of forthcoming new album, Metropolis. Metropolis, FM's first new album since Dead Man's Shoes in 1995, was showcased at a sell-out launch party at The Roadhouse, Covent Garden, London in February 2010 and was released on 31 May 2010. Produced by the band, Metropolis met with critical acclaim and the two singles from the album - \\"Hollow\\" (released 17 May 2010) and \\"Bring Back Yesterday\\" (released 7 September 2010) each spent a month on the playlist at BBC Radio 2 and were playlisted on many other radio stations. FM toured all over the UK in support of the album throughout 2010. Their live schedule included a set on the main stage at Download Festival as a late replacement for Ratt in June 2010 and a set on the main stage at Hard Rock Hell IV at Prestatyn in December. December also saw the return of an FM tradition with a 'Christmas Party' show at Islington Academy London. FM started 2011 with a show at London's Hammersmith Apollo on 22 January with Thin Lizzy. The rest of the year saw the band return to many overseas strongholds of years gone by including headline shows in the Netherlands and Spain (their first ever live concert in that country); a show with D-A-D in Portugal; dates with Journey and Foreigner in Germany, Dublin and Belfast and appearances at major festivals such as Graspop in Belgium and Sweden Rock. They were also invited back to play at Download Festival again. In January 2012 FM headlined the Sunday night Rock Stage at the Great British Rock & Blues Festival in Skegness and during March they staged three special concerts in Glasgow, Manchester and London to celebrate the 25th Anniversary of the release of their d√©but album Indiscreet. These shows saw FM play Indiscreet live in its entirety for the first time ever as part of a full show and were commemorated by the release of the live in concert DVD Indiscreet 25 Live on 1 April 2013, filmed at the Manchester and London shows. In mid-August 2012 FM performed as Special Guests of Thin Lizzy at shows in Carlisle and Belsonic 2012 in Belfast and followed this with the Special Guest slot on Thin Lizzy's UK tour in November/December 2012 alongside The Treatment. The nine- track mini-album Only Foolin' EP was released 26 November 2012 featuring a mix of new studio recordings and live tracks recorded at FM's \\"Indiscreet 25Live\\" shows earlier in the year. In November 2012 FM announced their forthcoming seventh studio album would be released March 2013 with the title Rockville by launching a PledgeMusic campaign. Via PledgeMusic fans could pre-order the album along with pledging for other items such as a two-CD package to include Rockville II (a second CD of nine new tracks and a new recording of the song \\"High\\", originally released by Steve Overland and Pete Jupp under the SO! banner on the album Brass Monkey), Steve Overland's microphone, various items autographed by the band and VIP concert access. FM held a press launch for Rockville at London O2 Academy 2 Islington on 6 March 2013 which was also attended by Pledgers via the band's PledgeMusic campaign. Following a playback of the album in full the band played a half-hour set of some of their crowd- pleasing anthems before a playback of Rockville II. Rockville was released 11 March 2013 and debuted on the Official UK Rock Chart at #6, followed on 25 March by the release of Rockville II which had earned an official release of its own due to the amount of interest generated by its inclusion in FM's PledgeMusic campaign. On 15 March 2013 FM began a UK tour in support of Rockville. Special Guests for the first four dates on the tour were Vega and Serpentine whilst It Bites and Vega were Special Guests for the second half of the tour. The tour was followed on 6 April 2013 by a set at the inaugural HRH AOR festival which was held at Rotherham's Magna Science Adventure Centre on a bill which included Tesla, Danny Vaughn and past touring-mates Romeo's Daughter. In June 2013 FM played at HiRock, a two-day festival held in Germany at Freilichtb√ºhne Loreley and the Max Aicher Arena in Inzell. Other artists performing at HiRock included Toto, Rick Springfield, Whitesnake, Journey and Black Star Riders. Due to adverse weather conditions and extensive flooding in the surrounding area the second day of the festival at Inzell did not take place. On 27 July 2013 the band were Special Guests at Planet Rock's Steelhouse Festival in Wales followed the next day by a headline show at The River Rooms in Stourbridge with Toby Jepson performing an acoustic set as Special Guest. During June and July 2013 the band's single \\"Story Of My Life\\" from Rockville spent several weeks on the BBC Radio 2 playlist. In December Toby Jepson returned as Special Guest for FM's final headline appearance of the year at a sold-out The Box in Crewe and the band ended the year with a set on the main stage at Planet Rock's Planet Rockstock festival. Their single \\"Better Late Than Never\\" was added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist on 26 December 2013. On the afternoon of Saturday 8 February 2014 FM headlined the 'Reds' stage at the Giants Of Rock festival in Minehead, also appearing were Elliott Randall, Molly Hatchet and Big Country. A large part of the original Friday line-up for this festival was cancelled, resulting in stage times throughout the rest of the weekend being rescheduled. During 2014 - in addition to writing and recording for their next release - FM toured across the UK with Foreigner and Europe during March / April 2014, with further European dates alongside Foreigner and a series of headline shows in the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Portugal taking them into May. To coincide with this tour FM released a new eleven-track EP entitled Futurama on 31 March 2014. Futurama includes four new studio tracks, six new live recordings and an extended mix. The second half of 2014 featured FM's 30th Anniversary celebrations. They headlined Cambridge Rock Festival on Saturday 9 August 2014 with Bernie Marsden joining FM onstage during the encore for a rendition of \\"Here I Go Again\\". Bernie Marsden joined FM again for the encore at The River Rooms in Stourbridge during their 30th Anniversary Tour in November. The tour also took in shows at Southampton, Cardiff, Bingley, Southend and Holmfirth with special guests including Toby Jepson, Hand Of Dimes and Three Lions. A late cancellation by Vandenberg's Moonkings and a call from the Planet Rock festival organisers resulted in FM rounding off 2014 with a surprise appearance on the main stage at Planet Rockstock on Sunday 7 December. FM released their ninth studio album Heroes and Villains via Frontiers Records on 20 April 2015 (UK / Europe) and 21 April 2015 (USA) and embarked on a UK tour in May with Special Guests Romeo's Daughter and No Hot Ashes. The track \\"Shape I'm In\\" from the new album was added to the BBC Radio 2 playlist from Saturday 4 April 2015. Festival appearances in 2015 included Nantwich Jazz, Frontiers Rock Festival in Italy (FM's first-ever performance in Italy), Rock The Ring in Switzerland, Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium, Netherlands festival Bospop, Team Rock's inaugural Ramblin' Man Fair in Maidstone, Steelhouse Festival in Wales and two festivals in Sweden at Skogsr√∂jet in Rejmyre and Helge√•festivalen in Knislinge. In November 2015 FM continued their European Tour with more UK dates followed by a co-headline run of shows in mainland Europe with Electric Boys. Their last show of the year was headlining Planet Rockstock, the band's third appearance at the festival in three years. FM's Heroes and Villains tour continued through 2016 with dates across the UK in January (Special Guests Romeo's Daughter, The King Lot, Bernie Marsden and No Hot Ashes). Festival appearances included The Great British Rock & Blues Festival, Rockweekend AOR and V√§sby Rock Festival in Sweden, and Nantwich Jazz, Blues & Music Festival. The band also featured as Special Guests on Heart's \\"She Devils\\" UK tour in the summer of 2016, performing at London's Royal Albert Hall, Manchester O2 Apollo, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Birmingham Symphony Hall. Also in 2016 FM celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album with the release of Indiscreet 30, re-recording the original tracks to update the album - \\"We are not trying to recreate the original, but this is our interpretation played by FM as we are today with the sound of FM 2016\\" explained Merv Goldsworthy. In 2017 FM played their first-ever show in Greece to a sell-out crowd along with appearances at HRH AOR festival, a unique triple-headline bill alongside The Quireboys and Gun as part of the Castell Roc Music Festival at Chepstow Castle, Escape Open Air and HEAT festivals in Germany, Rock & Blues Custom Show in Pentrich and a return to Cambridge Rock Festival. FM's eleventh studio album Atomic Generation was released on 30 March 2018 via Frontiers Records (14 March 2018 in Japan). In addition to shows across the UK throughout 2018 - including dates with Dare and Toby Jepson - FM appeared at Frontiers Rock Festival in Milan on 29 April and played the USA for the first time when they headlined at Melodic Rock Fest 5 in Chicago on 6 May, following this with a headline set at the sister festival Melodic Rock Fest Scandinavia in Malm√∂ on 1 June. In September 2018 FM accepted an invitation to join Saxon as Special Guests on their \\"Thunderbolt Tour Part 2\\" to replace previously announced Y&T; whose singer / guitarist Dave Meniketti was suffering from a serious back injury and thus unable to embark on the tour. The three-band bill toured throughout Europe from 19 September to 16 October with Raven as opening act and with Wayward Sons opening for four shows in the UK 18‚Äì21 October. With current keyboardist Jem Davis unable to join FM for the European shows at such short notice, the band recruited guest keyboard player and original band member Didge Digital for the European dates with Jem Davis performing at the UK shows.

Located in Rota in the Province of C√°diz, NAVSTA Rota is the largest American military community in Spain, housing US Navy and US Marine Corps personnel. There are also small US Army and US Air Force contingents on the base. History NAVSTA Rota has been in use since 1953, when Spanish dictator Francisco Franco strengthened relations with the United States in order to improve local economies. The installation now covers more than on the northern shore of Cadiz, an area recognized for its strategic, maritime importance over the centuries. U.S. Air Force Boeing C-135B-BN Stratolifter circa mid-1960s The Chief of Naval Operations deployed Submarine Squadron 16 (SUBRON 16) to Rota on 28 January 1964 and embarked upon . completed its first Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) deterrent patrol with the Polaris missile and commenced the first refit and replenishment at Rota. During the early 1970s, the submarines assigned to SUBRON 16 were completing conversion to the Poseidon missile. That transition was completed when returned to Rota on 14 January 1974. Treaty negotiations between Spain and the United States in 1975 resulted in a planned withdrawal of SUBRON 16 from Spain, and the Chief of Naval Operations ordered studies to select a new refit site on the East Coast of the United States. The US Senate ratified the treaty in June 1976; it called for the squadron's withdrawal from Spain by July 1979. In November 1976 the Secretary of the Navy announced Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia as that new refit site. At its peak size in the early 1980s, NAVSTA Rota was home to 16,000 sailors and their families, to include two permanently forward deployed aviation squadrons, Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron Two (VQ-2) and Fleet Logistics Support Squadron Twenty Two (VR-22). VQ-2 was based at Rota from 1959 until 2005, when it relocated to NAS Whidbey Island, Washington. VR-22 flew the C-130F and was based at Rota from 1982 until its inactivation in 1993. Through the early 1990s, a patrol squadron of P-3 Orion aircraft based in the United States would also be split- based between NAVSTA Rota and the Naval Air Facility at Lajes Air Base in the Azores to track Soviet naval vessels and submarines in the Atlantic Ocean and in the Mediterranean. The patrol squadrons would rotate this deployment assignment to Rota and Lajes every six months and were augmented by Naval Air Reserve patrol squadrons for shorter durations on a periodic basis. With the downsizing of the US Navy during the late 1980s and early 1990s, especially after the end of the Cold War, the base's population dramatically declined. The US Navy maintains approximately of the complex. There are about 4,000 Americans in Rota, including military, civilians, and their families. As US Navy started to reduce its presence USAF realized the potential of the airfield as a refuelling stop in Middle East deployments. Rota was used by C-5 and C-141 planes in the Gulf War in 1991. Later the US agreed with Spain to improve air base installations so it could handle more cargo plane operations. In April 2011, the commander of the US Navy garrison at the base, Captain William F. Mosk, was relieved of command and reassigned during an investigation into illegal drug use by US servicemen at the installation. Rear Admiral Tony Gaiani relieved Mosk for \\"lost confidence in his ability to command\\", specifically, to handle issues related to the investigation.Jontz, Sandra, \\"Naval Station Rota commander is relieved of command\\", Stars and Stripes, 19 April 2011. On October 5, 2011, US Secretary of Defense Panetta announced that the USN will station four Aegis warships at Rota to strengthen its presence in the Mediterranean Sea and bolster the missile defense of NATO as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach (EPAA). As of 2015, four US destroyers, including , , and are permanently forward-deployed to Naval Station Rota as part of the Missile Defense System.

The base is the headquarters for Commander, US Naval Activities Spain (COMNAVACTSPAIN), as well as a primary gateway for Air Mobility Command flights into Europe. Naval Station Rota is strategically located near the Strait of Gibraltar and at the halfway point between the United States and Southwest Asia. Because of this ideal location, the base is able to provide invaluable support to both US Sixth Fleet units in the Mediterranean and to USAF Air Mobility Command units transiting to Germany and Southwest Asia. The Base and its tenant commands are located within the boundaries of the Spanish \\"Base Naval de Rota\\". Under the guidance of the Agreement for Defense Cooperation, the US and Spanish navies work together and share many facilities. The US Navy has the responsibility for maintaining the station's infrastructure, including a airfield, three active piers, 426 facilities and 806 family housing units. From Naval Station Rota Spain, the VLF-transmitter Guardamar, which uses Torreta de Guardamar, the tallest man-made structure in the European Union as antenna, is telecontroled. Occupants The base is used jointly by Spain and the United States. It remains under the Spanish flag and is commanded by a Spanish Vice Admiral. While the Spanish Navy is responsible for external security of the base, both Navies are charged with internal security. NAVSTA Rota is technically a tenant facility of the Rota Spanish Navy base. As a result, certain US military customs are not observed, such as the display of a US Flag, which is only allowed during the annual Fourth of July celebration or occasionally at half mast as a mark of respect with the ad-hoc permission of the Spanish Admiral. =Spanish Navy= This Base houses the Fleet Headquarters and the Naval Action Force, as well as the main operational units of the Navy: Naval Action Group 2, Aircraft Flotilla, 41st Escort Squadron.

The Naval Station is the only base in the Mediterranean capable of supporting Amphibious Readiness Group post-deployment wash-downs. The base port also offers secure, pier-side maintenance and back-load facilities. Rota supports Amphibious Readiness Group turnovers and hosts Sailors and Marines from visiting afloat units. The base also provides Quality of Life support to Mor√≥n Air Base, ARG support sites at Palma de Majorca, NATO headquarters in Madrid and the Military Sealift Command's Maritime Prepositioning Squadron 1. The mission of US Forces at Rota, as well as other US Navy installations in the Mediterranean such as NAS Sigonella and Souda Air Base is to provide Command, Control and Logistics Support to US and NATO Operating Forces. These three facilities are undergoing a transformation from Maritime Patrol Aircraft airfields to multi-role ‚Äúhubs‚Äù providing crucial air-links for USAF strategic airlift and mobility in support of US European Command (EUCOM), Central Command (CENTCOM) and African Area contingency operations under CENTCOM, EUCOM and the evolving Africa Command (AFRICOM).

Opposition Since the 1980s, various leftist and activist pacifist groups have marched annually to protest the presence of US and Spanish military personnel and equipment at the port of Rota. The most common path marches alongside the seaside streets of the town to protest at the individual US (NAVSTA Rota), Spanish (Base Naval de Rota) and joint gates, where representatives of the groups read proclamations in favour of peace and freedom.

First spidron created by D√°niel Erd√©ly in 1979, consisting of equilateral triangles and the symmetrical obtuse isosceles triangles which together form right triangles In geometry, a spidron is a continuous flat geometric figure composed entirely of triangles, where, for every pair of joining triangles, each has a leg of the other as one of its legs, and neither has any point inside the interior of the other. A deformed spidron is a three-dimensional figure sharing the other properties of a specific spidron, as if that spidron were drawn on paper, cut out in a single piece, and folded along a number of legs. Origin and development Spidron hexagon, similar to the 1979 image It was first modelled in 1979 by D√°niel Erd√©ly, as a homework presented to Ern≈ë Rubik, for Rubik's design class, at the Hungarian University of Arts and Design (now: Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design). Erd√©ly also gave the name \\"Spidron\\" to it, when he discovered it in the early 70s. The name originates from the English names of spider and spiral, because the shape is reminiscent of a spider web.\\"Spidrons\\", Jugend- forscht.de . The term ends with the affix \\"-on\\" as in polygon. In his initial work Erd√©ly started with a hexagon. He combined every corner with the after- next one. In his mathematical analysis of spidrons Stefan Stenzhorn demonstrated that it is possible to create a spidron with every regular Polygon greater than four. Furthermore, you can vary the number of points to the next combination. Stenzhorn reasoned that after all the initial hexagon- spidron is just the special case of a general spidron.. Mathematical description of spidrons by Stefan Stenzhorn . In a two-dimensional plane a tessellation with hexagon-spidrons is possible. The form is known from many works by M.C. Escher, who devoted himself to such bodies of high symmetry. Due to their symmetry spidrons are also an interesting object for mathematicians. The spidrons can appear in a very large number of versions, and the different formations make possible the development of a great variety of plane, spatial and mobile applications. These developments are suitable to perform aesthetic and practical functions that are defined in advance by the consciously selected arrangements of all the possible characteristics of symmetry. The spidron system is under the protection of several know-how and industrial pattern patents. It was awarded a gold medal at the exhibition Genius Europe in 2005. It has been presented in a number of art magazines, conferences and international exhibitions. During the last two years it has also appeared, in several versions, as a public area work. Since spidron-system is the personal work by D√°niel Erd√©ly but in the development of the individual formations he worked together with several Hungarian, Dutch, Canadian and American colleagues, the exhibition is a collective product in a sense, several works and developments are a result of an international team-work. Spidron is a registered trademark. Many spidrons are designed to correspond to deformed spidrons that are also polyhedra.

It built on the brand and format established by XFM London. The majority of programming was shared but some was produced specifically for Manchester. At its launch in 2006 it was owned by GCap Media, and later became part of the Global Radio group. In September 2015 the station was replaced, along with XFM London, by Radio X. Launch XFM Manchester was awarded a 12-year (until 2017) FM radio licence on 9 June 2005, beating 18 rival bids. Established local radio presenter Terry Christian was cited in the licence application document but he remained at the relaunched BBC Radio Manchester. Before its launch 20 February 2006, XFM Manchester began occasional technical tests consisting of a playlist of songs chosen to appeal to its audience. XFM Manchester was launched at 8 am on 15 March 2006. A collage of Manchester related clips was played, and I Am the Resurrection by The Stone Roses, and Song 2 by Blur. The first presenter on air was Paul Tonkinson. Launch events were held all day across Manchester, including a world record attempt in Albert Square to shake the most number of maracas at any one time. Some presenters were formerly members of Manchester bands and institutions, including Inspiral Carpets' keyboard player Clint Boon, Elbow's frontman Guy Garvey, The Smiths' bass player Andy Rourke, Factory Records boss Tony Wilson, and The Ha√ßienda's Dave Haslam. Transmitter and studios XFM was initially broadcast from studios at Laser House in Salford Quays, the same building as Century 105.4. But after Century was sold by GCap Media to GMG in late 2006, the two stations ceased to share resources, and Xfm Manchester moved to studios at the nearby Exchange Quay, also in Salford. After Global Radio acquired the station, it moved the operations of its own Capital FM Manchester to the same site. XFM Manchester's 1 kW transmitter is situated on the roof of City Tower, formerly the Sunley Building, overlooking Piccadilly Gardens in the city centre, the same place as Capital FM Manchester and 106.1 Rock Radio's transmitter. All three services share the same broadcast antenna system situated on the centre's tower which is illuminated with red Aircraft warning lights at night. Xfm's analogue signal is available to an estimated 1.3 million people over the age of 15. XU and daytime networking In May 2007, the then-owner of XFM Manchester, GCap Media, announced that all local presenters would be removed from the daytime (10 am-4 pm) lineup. Instead, an interactive show, incorporating listener requests via the website and phone in, 'vox-pops', live music and entertainment news would be broadcast. This show, named XU, was launched later that month. It received mixed reviews, and was eventually dropped a year later, replaced with networked daytime content sourced from XFM London. Manchester United commentary In August 2007, XFM Manchester acquired the rights from 105.4 Century FM to broadcast commentary from all Manchester United games, as an adjunct to the station's usual music programming, with commentary provided by presenters including Mickey Thomas. The contract ran for one season with Key 103 becoming United's official commentary partner for 2008‚Äì11.Key 103 wins Manchester United commentary rights Planned sale by GCap and Global takeover In February 2008 GCap Media announced it would be selling the analogue licence for the station. This decision was blamed on GCap's desire to cut costs while trying to fight off a takeover bid by rival group Global Radio. Once Global's takeover of GCap succeeded, the decision to sell Xfm Manchester was reversed.

He was a leading figure of the new philosophers. Glucksmann began his career as a Marxist, but went on to reject communism in the popular book La Cuisini√®re et le Mangeur d'Hommes (1975), and later became an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and post-Soviet Russian foreign policy. He was a strong supporter of human rights. In recent years he opposed the claim that Islamic terrorism is the product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West. Early years Andr√© Glucksmann was born in 1937 in Boulogne-Billancourt, the son of Ashkenazi Jewish parents from Austria- Hungary. His father was from Bukovina, which later became part of Romania, and his mother from Prague, which later became the capital of Czechoslovakia. Glucksmann's father was killed in World War II, and his mother and sister were active in the French Resistance. The family \\"narrowly escaped deportation to the camps\\" during the Holocaust, which influenced Glucksmann's developing ideas of \\"the state as the ultimate source of barbarism\\". He studied at the Lyc√©e la Martini√®re in Lyon, and later enrolled at √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint-Cloud. His first book, Le Discours de la Guerre, was published in 1968. CareerEarly career= In 1975 he published the anti-Marxist book La Cuisini√®re et le Mangeur d'Hommes - subtitled R√©flexions sur l'√âtat, le marxisme et les camps de concentration, in which he argued that Marxism leads inevitably to totalitarianism, tracing parallels between the crimes of Nazism and Communism. In his next book Les maitres penseurs, published in 1977 and translated into English as Master Thinkers (Harper & Row, 1980), he traced the intellectual justification for totalitarianism back to the ideas articulated by various German philosophers such as Fichte, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche. In the years of the Vietnam War, Glucksmann rose to national prominence after expressing his support for Vietnamese boat people. He began working with Bernard-Henri L√©vy criticizing Communism. Both had formerly been well known Marxists. Shortly afterwards they became known, along with others of their generation who rejected Marxism, as New Philosophers, a term coined by L√©vy. =1980s and 1990s= In 1985, Glucksmann signed a petition to President Reagan urging him to continue his support for the Contras in Nicaragua. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Glucksmann became an advocate for the use of nuclear power. In 1995 he supported the resumption of nuclear tests by Jacques Chirac. He supported the NATO intervention in Serbia in 1999. He also called for Chechnya to become independent. =Philosophy= Glucksmann speaking at a conference in Paris, 2002 In his book Dostoyevsky in Manhattan, Glucksmann asserts that nihilism, particularly as depicted by Dostoyevsky in his novels Demons and The Brothers Karamazov, is the 'characteristic form' of modern terrorism. Drawing on Ivan Karamazov's dictum that \\"If there is no God, everything is permitted\\", Glucksmann argues that: > The inner nature of nihilistic terrorism is that everything is permissible, > whether because God exists and I am his representative, or because God does > not exist and I take his place. His 2006 book Une rage d‚Äôenfant is an autobiography which talks about how his experiences as a young Jew in occupied France led to his interest in philosophy and his belief in the importance of intervention: > My style of thinking is to compare what happens on the TV, in the news and > so on, and then extract what I can from books of philosophers to understand > it. Philosophy for me is like subtitles. The problem comes from current > events but the answer is supplied by philosophy. Glucksmann criticises the notion that Islamic terrorism is a product of the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West, arguing that the first victims of Islamic terrorism are Muslims: > Why do the 200,000 slaughtered Muslims of Darfur not arouse even half a > quarter of the fury caused by 200-times fewer dead in Lebanon? Must we > deduce that Muslims killed by other Muslims don‚Äôt count ‚Äì whether in the > eyes of Muslim authorities or viewed through the bad conscience of the West? = Later years = Glucksmann supported military action by the West in Afghanistan and Iraq, and was highly critical of Russian foreign policy, supporting for example Chechen independence. However, he was against the Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence from Georgia, arguing that Georgia is essential to maintaining European Union \\"energy independence,\\" vis-a-vis Russia, through access to oil and gas reserves in the former Soviet republics: \\"If Tbilisi falls, there will be no way to get around Gazprom and guarantee autonomous access to the gas and petroleum wealth of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan\\". Glucksmann in Festival SOS 4.8 in Murcia, 2009 As proof of Russia's plans to use energy blackmail, Glucksmann referenced a biting anti- Gazprom satirical song performed at the annual satirical award show \\"Silver Rubber Boot\\", which made jokes like: \\"If the Eurovision Song Contest denies victory to Russia again, we are going to drive to their concert and block their gas with our bodies!\\" Glucksmann cited this as evidence that the Russian people want to cut off gas to Ukraine and Europe. He wrote: > Consider a popular song performed by a military choir in Moscow. Its chorus > depicts the \\"radiant future\\" that Gazprom is preparing: \\"Europe has a > problem with us? We will cut off its gas...\\" The Russian public loves the > song.A Hot Summer in Europe, Andr√© Glucksmann City Journal, 30 July 2009 Glucksmann supported Nicolas Sarkozy for the April‚ÄìMay 2007 presidential election.Pourquoi je choisis Nicolas Sarkozy, Le Monde, 29 January 2007 In August 2008 he co-signed an open letter with V√°clav Havel, Desmond Tutu, and Wei Jingsheng calling upon the Chinese authorities to respect human rights both during and after the Beijing Olympic Games. He was a signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism. Death Glucksmann died in Paris on 10 November 2015 at the age of 78. In reaction to his death, President Fran√ßois Hollande said that Glucksmann always \\"listened to the suffering of peoples\\". Former president and opposition leader Nicolas Sarkozy commented on Glucksmann's death by saying: \\"[Glucksmann] turned a page in French thought from the second half of the 20th Century\\".

Radio X launched nationally on 21 September 2015 as a rebrand of Xfm and superseded Xfm London and Xfm Manchester. The station has employed a number of DJs that have since gone on to greater fame including Russell Brand, Karl Pilkington, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, Simon Pegg, Christian O'Connell, Justin Lee Collins, Adam and Joe, Alex Zane, Tim Lovejoy, Dermot O'Leary and Josh Widdicombe. History Xfm was created in London in 1992 by Sammy Jacob (who founded its precursor Q102) and Chris Parry. The station became full-time on 1 September 1997. During the following year the station played a range of music from its studios in 97 Charlotte Street. Jacob would later go on to co-found NME Radio and CDNX (Camden Experience) in 2008 and 2015 respectively. In 1998, Xfm was acquired by the Capital Radio Group (now part of Global Radio) and relocated from Charlotte Street to Capital's headquarters at Leicester Square, where it remains today. On 23 August of that year, Xfm was closed down for four days, during which a test tape featuring mainstream soft-rock acts was looped. The station subsequently relaunched with a more mainstream format, and a new advert featuring a cartoon radio saying \\"Don't be afraid!\\", which referred to the perceived inaccessibility of its old format. The soft-rock revamp was not a success, culminating in listener-led protests outside the Capital Radio studios. Listeners also lodged objections with the Radio Authority, which found XFM to be acting in a manner contrary to its licence requirements, and a degree of alternative output was eventually restored, particularly through night-time playlists and specialist shows. Following the take-over by Capital, the station dropped its wide-ranging music policy, which was replaced by a format based on USA college stations. The first audience figures after this change showed a sharp decline. The DJs were no longer able to select some of their own tracks, and specialist shows were dropped. The station soon became more male-orientated and featured football coverage and \\"laddish\\" output. This came to an end after the Radio Authority fined XFM ¬£50,000 for breakfast presenter Tom Binns's joking about bestiality on air. Capital Radio attempted to increase XFM's listening figures, recruiting DJs such as Zoe Ball, former BBC Radio 1 presenter, and re-recruiting comedians Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant who took voluntary redundancy when Capital bought the station, after the pair rose to significance with the first airing of The Office. Together with talent such as Zane Lowe and Christian O'Connell, this yielded growing listening figures. The music was, and is today, a play-listed mix of popular indie and soft rock. Host John Kennedy is the only member of the current presenter lineup that has been with the radio station since its very first broadcasts.https://completemusicupdate.com/article/qa-john-kennedy-xfm/ His new music show, X-Posure is the station's longest running show and is credited as being the first to give radio play to artists including Adele, Florence and the Machine, Razorlight and Mumford & Sons.https://www.radiox.co.uk/news/john- kennedy-wins-arqiva-music-champion-award/ =Expansion of the Xfm Network= Xfm logo used from 2004‚Äì15. Xfm has held 28-day Restricted Service Licence FM broadcasts in a number of British cities, including Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Glasgow. In 2000, Xfm London was added to a number of DAB multiplexes around the country, and in January 2006 its reach expanded when it replaced The Storm on a number of other local multiplexes, creating near- national coverage. It was at one point reported that this 'national' version of Xfm London (known as Xfm UK) would have local content drop-ins within it (e.g. news, travel) over time, but this ultimately never came to pass. Most DAB coverage of XFM carried the London version of the station, but for a time some multiplexes in the North of England instead received a feed of XFM Manchester. In 2001, Xfm rehired Ricky Gervais and Steve Merchant to run the Saturday afternoon show. Karl Pilkington joined them to 'just push the buttons' but eventually became the focal point of the show. The trio often called the station a 'tin pot station', 'shoddy' and 'not just a small station in London but the smallest station in that building'. By 2002, the station had added many specialist shows, such as 'London Express', 'The A-Z of Alternative Music' and 'The Remix'. Afternoon and early-evening shows with Zane Lowe and Tim Lovejoy were innovative and although the daytime playlist consisted of 40 current releases, these were changed frequently, and the overall playlist contained about 90 records. However, in time the specialist shows gradually declined in number, and the playlist was again restricted in number. On 9 June 2005, the group was awarded a permanent FM broadcasting licence to serve the city of Manchester as Xfm Manchester. This station went on air in March 2006. Also in 2005, Xfm was among the bidders for the regional North East franchise on 97.5 FM,XFM application for North East licence from Ofcom site (pdf) but this licence was ultimately awarded to Smooth Radio by Ofcom. On 4 January 2006, GCap Media relaunched its Central Scotland regional station Beat 106 as Xfm Scotland. In 2007, a fourth station joined the network with the launch of a new regional Xfm for south Wales, based at the Cardiff studio also home to Red Dragon FM (now Capital South Wales). =Output changes= In May 2007, in an attempt to cut costs, the parent company of Xfm, GCap Media, announced that they would be removing all presenters from the daytime (10 am‚Äì4 pm) lineup and replacing them with a jukebox based upon listener requests through their websites. On 6 March 2008 an announcement was made reversing the decision to remove daytime presenters. From 25 March 2008 a new schedule restoring daytime schedules was put in place. A new schedule was launched on 12 January 2009. Changes at this date included Jo Good leaving the Afternoon Show, including Afternoon X List, and new signing Richard Skinner taking over the Morning Show from Rick Shaw. The times of the shows were also adjusted, with the morning show only becoming a two-hour show (previously a three-hour show) and the afternoon show becoming a four-hour show (previously a 3-hour show). The weekend schedule was also adjusted at this time, with Rick Shaw moving to present the Weekend Morning Show on Saturday and Sunday from 10 am to 2 pm and Lliana Bird taking over the afternoon slots. This led to other changes in the weekend schedule, such as Marsha Shandur's Sunday Brunch ending, and the air times of Marc Haynes Certificate X changing (from 1 pm ‚Äì 3 pm to 6 pm ‚Äì 8 pm). Jo Good left the station during these changes, but rejoined at the end of 2012. On 11 February 2008 GCap Media announced that they would be selling the analogue licence for the Manchester, Scotland and South Wales stations, retaining only XFM London. This decision was made in an attempt to shore up profits and concentrate on 'winning brands', calling the former nationalisation strategy into question. After this announcement, in early 2008, breakfast show host Alex Zane admitted on air that the future of the London station was also being reviewed, even making jokey references to perhaps being out of a job soon. The sale of the South Wales station went ahead, with Town and Country Broadcasting relaunching this as Nation Radio; the sale of the Scotland and Manchester stations was suspended when Global Radio entered into discussions to purchase GCap Media. The re-appointment of a previous Programme Controller in 2011 led to a number of changes to Xfm's output. Specialist shows such as Music:Response and Mix Master Mike Show returned, as did presenter Danny Wallace. In September 2011 a new Xfm schedule began, and included Mary Anne Hobbs moving to a re-launched evening show, Music:Response. A new \\"local\\" slot was introduced. Broadcaster Richard Skinner left the station after two years. The show Import:Export, produced and directed by Redefined Media, was resurrected and linked to KROQ Los Angeles. Further weekend signings included The Sun journalist Gordon Smart starting a three-hour Sunday show. Smart's show ended in October 2013 when he left to join the Scottish Sun as editor. As part of the 2013 schedule Jon Holmes took over the breakfast show. Comedian Josh Widdicombe presented a show on Saturdays between 10 am and 1 pm. It was announced in March 2015 that Russell Brand would be hosting a new Sunday night show, which was to first air on 15 March. Following Heart and Galaxy owner Global's takeover of GCap Media, Xfm Scotland became Galaxy (it went on to become Capital Scotland in 2011), leaving just Manchester and London with local Xfm stations. Following Global's acquisition of Real and Smooth Ltd, the Paisley/Renfrewshire 96.3 FM service previously broadcast as Real Radio XS became a new XFM Scotland in 2014. This service was available across central Scotland over DAB. Up until the end of the Xfm branding, the London, Manchester and Scotland stations broadcast 43 hours a week of local programming ‚Äì weekday breakfast and drive, and four hours a day at weekends ‚Äì with networked programming, primarily from London, at other times. TV platforms followed the London output and all three stations were streamed online. =Rebrand as Radio X= On 7 September 2015, it was announced that Xfm would be rebranded as Radio X on 21 September. The rebrand was carried out in partnership with creative agency We Are MBC. The rebranded station launched with new presenters including Chris Moyles, Vernon Kay, Johnny Vaughan and Ricky Wilson joining some existing XFM presenters on a refreshed schedule. XFM aired its last day of programming on Sunday 13 September 2015. XFM Scotland ceased broadcasting entirely on the same day with Global Radio handing back the Paisley licence to Ofcom. A 'holding' service of music and announcements began transmitting on national DAB under the Radio X title the following day, with this service also taking the place of XFM on FM, TV and online until the full launch of the new Radio X at 6:30am on Monday 21 September 2015. The first song played on the rebranded Radio X, by Chris Moyles just before 7am on 21 September 2015, was \\"Love Machine\\" by Girls Aloud, an off-format nod to media reports of a male bias by the new station. Radio X is now available nationally via Digital One national DAB, with all local-layer XFM carriage dropped (replaced in many cases by Gold). The new national Radio X also replaced XFM on FM in London and Manchester, and on other platforms including TV and online. There is no longer any local output on the Manchester station, and the only variance between the UK, London and Manchester services is split advertising and top-of-the-hour news intros. In October 2019, Radio X's DAB station switched to DAB+ using a lower quality 40bps stream. The change was made to make room for LBC News on the Digital One multiplex.

He became widely known for leading peasants during the German Peasants' War.  Early life  The arms of the Geyer family: a ram's head Florian Geyer was born around 1490 at Geyer Castle in Giebelstadt, Lower Franconia. After the deaths of his father Dietrich (in 1492) and of his two older brothers, Florian Geyer inherited the family castle and fortune. In 1512 and 1513, he was a guest at the court of King Henry VIII in England, where he may have been exposed to the reformist ideas of John Wycliffe and the Lollards. In 1517, after refusing to pay 350-year-old interest claims from Neum√ºnster Collegiate Church, Geyer was excommunicated. In 1519, Geyer served under Casimir Margrave of Brandeburg-Kulmbach in the army of the Swabian League against Ulrich Duke of W√ºrttemberg and G√∂tz von Berlichingen in M√∂ckm√ºhl. Later that year Brandeburg-Kulmbach sent Geyer to his brother Albrecht Duke of Brandenburg-Prussia, then Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, to support him in the Polish-Teutonic War (1519‚Äì1521). Geyer negotiated the truce which ended it. He remained in Brandenburg-Prussia's service until 1523, travelling to various European courts on diplomatic missions. In 1523, Geyer accompanied Martin Luther on a visit to Wittenberg in Brandenburg-Prussia. If not already sympathetic to the Protestant reformation, Geyer was probably won over to Luther's ideals at this meeting.  German Peasants' War  When the German Peasants' War broke out in 1524, Florian Geyer, together with a handful of low-ranking knights and several hundred hastily-trained peasant militiamen, established the Black Company (often called the Black Host or Black Band), which was possibly the only heavy cavalry division in European history to fight on the side of a peasant revolution. By checking Imperial and Protestant knights on the battlefield, the Black Company allowed preacher Thomas M√ºntzer and his infantry to score a string of victories in Thuringia. Geyer is reputed to have had the words \\"Nulla crux, nulla corona\\" (Neither cross nor crown) scratched on the blade of his sword.Ernst Bloch, Atheism in Christianity: the religion of the Exodus and the Kingdom (Herder & Herder: New York 1972), p. 272-273. All sides credited him with the wanton destruction of cathedrals and castles, and summary executions of the lords and priests contained therein. These destructions played a part in causing Martin Luther to side with the princes, calling on them to slaughter the rebellious peasants. As the Peasants' War dragged on, many of the rebel peasants returned home, and most of the knights who, alongside Geyer, had joined M√ºntzer deserted or defected. M√ºntzer himself was defeated at the Battle of Frankenhausen and executed shortly afterwards.  Death  Conflicting accounts place Geyer with the company, or alone in Rothingen in the aftermath of the Battle of Frankenhausen. The Black Company was falsely informed of victory at Frankenhausen, and ambushed outside of Ingolstadt. They managed to regroup, retreat, and fortify the town's castle and cathedral. The cathedral was burned with no survivors, and the castle was taken after three assaults. A portion of the Black Company broke free, only to be encircled again in nearby woodlands. If Geyer had been leading the Black Company through the Battle of Ingolstadt, he barely escaped with his life. Geyer may, however, have been stranded at Rothingen the entire time while waiting for an escort from the Black Company, which was only to be barred from entering the town. The later attempts to stamp out memory of the uprising have obscured these details. Whether or not Geyer was at Ingolstadt, he was one of the last survivors. In the night from 9 to 10 June 1525 he was contacted in W√ºrzburg by two servants of his brother- in-law Wilhelm von Grumbach, who had the stated their intention of helping him rekindle the Peasants' War. While traveling together, they stabbed Geyer to death in the Gramschatz Forest near W√ºrzburg. The location of his remains is unknown.  Legacy  The family of Florian Geyer died out in the early 18th century and their castle in Giebelstadt passed into other hands, but is still the site of the annual \\"Florian Geyer Festspiele\\". Geyer was heralded as a communist revolutionary in Friedrich Engels' The Peasant War in Germany (1850). In this work, Engels asserts that the war was primarily a class struggle over control of farms and mines, which subverted the Biblical language and metaphors commonly understood by peasants. In this spirit, a regiment of the Border Troops of the German Democratic Republic, Grenzregiment 3 Florian Geyer, was named after him. Geyer was also the hero of one of Gerhart Hauptmann's major plays, the historical drama Florian Geyer (1896), and the inspiration for the German folk song, \\"Wir sind des Geyers schwarzer Haufen\\" (\\"We are Geyer's Black Band\\"), which has been adopted by union movements as a rousing anthem.tune and words, in an Australian version Geyer was also considered a heroic figure by Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist Party. The 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer was named after him in March 1944, during World War II.  Literature  * Hermann Barge: Florian Geyer. Eine biographische Studie.

Life Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Henry Bonnycastle was the son of Professor John Bonnycastle, and was born in 1791. He studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, as a cadet, and passed out as a second lieutenant of the royal engineers 28 September 1808, becoming a first lieutenant in the following year. He served at the siege of Flushing in 1809, and in the American campaigns of 1812‚Äì14, during which he was present at the capture of Fort Castine, and the occupation of the part of the state of Maine east of the Penobscot, and was commanding engineer at the construction of the extensive works thrown up by the British on the Castine peninsula. He attained the rank of captain in 1814, in which year he married the daughter of Captain W. Johnstone. Subsequently he served with the army of occupation in France. As commanding royal engineer in Upper Canada, he rendered very important services during the Canadian rebellion in 1837‚Äì39, particularly in February 1838, when, at the head of a force of militia and volunteers, in the absence of regular troops, he defeated the designs of the insurgents at Napairee, and the brigands at Hickory Island, for an attack on the city of Kingston. For these services he was knighted. In his capacity as a military engineer, Bonnycastle oversaw the fortification of Fort Henry in modern Kingston, Ontario. He was afterwards commanding engineer in Newfoundland. He became a brevet-major in 1837, a regimental lieutenant-colonel in 1840, and retired from the service in 1847. He died in 1848. Family Through his son, Henry William John Bonnycastle (1813‚Äì1888) would come a prominent Bonnycastle family of Canadian politicians and adventurers and the founder of Harlequin Enterprises, the world's largest publisher of romance novels.

Elisabeth of the Palatinate was a philosopher best known for her correspondence with Ren√© Descartes. She was critical of Descartes' dualistic metaphysics and her work anticipated the metaphysical concerns of later philosophers. Life Elisabeth at age 12. Elisabeth Simmern van Pallandt was born on December 26, 1618 in Heidelberg. She was the third of thirteen children and eldest daughter of Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and Elizabeth Stuart, daughter of James VI of Scotland and I of England and sister of Charles I. Much of Elisabeth's early life outside of her familial relations is unknown. After a short, unsuccessful reign in Bohemia, Elisabeth's parents were forced into exile in the Netherlands in 1620. Elisabeth stayed with her grandmother Louise Juliana of Nassau in Heidelberg before moving to the Netherlands at the age of nine. Elisabeth had a wide ranging education, studying philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, jurisprudence, history, modern and classical languages. Her siblings nicknamed her \\"La Grecque\\" (\\"The Greek\\") based on her skill with the ancient language. Elisabeth also studied the fine arts including painting, music and dancing. She may have been tutored by Constantijn Huygens. In 1633, Elisabeth received a proposal of marriage from W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, King of Poland. The marriage would have been beneficial to the Palatine fortunes, but the king was a Catholic, and Elisabeth refused to convert from her Protestant faith in order to facilitate the marriage. Edward Reynolds dedicated his Treatise on the passions and the faculties of the soule of man (1640) to Elisabeth. Although the exact context of the dedication is unknown, the dedication suggests that Elisabeth had seen a draft of the work. In 1642, Elisabeth read Descartes' Meditations on First Philosophy. In 1646, Elisabeth's brother Philip killed a man in a duel. Elisabeth was sent to stay with family in Germany where she tried to interest professors in Descartes' work. In 1660, Elisabeth entered the Lutheran convent at Herford, and in 1667 she became abbess of the convent. While the convent was Lutheran, Elisabeth was a Calvinist. Although the previous abbess (Elisabeth's cousin) had also been a Calvinist, this difference in faith created some initial distrust. As abbess, she presided over the convent and also governed the surrounding community of 7,000 people. While Elisabeth was abbess, the convent became a refuge from religious persecution for people and she welcomed more marginal religious sects, including the Labadists. When Robert Barclay's father David was imprisoned, Elisabeth intervened and helped to get him released. Elisabeth died on February 12, 1680. She was buried in the Abbey Church of Herford.  Correspondence  Elisabeth the hunter.Throughout her adult years, Elisabeth corresponded with many renowned intellectuals of her time. By 1639, Elisabeth was corresponding with Anna Maria van Schurman, a learned woman, called the Dutch Minerva. In an early letter van Schurman offered Elisabeth guidance on what subjects to study, arguing for the usefulness of history. Elisabeth's correspondence with Descartes began in 1643 and continued until Descartes's death in early 1650. At her request, Descartes became her teacher in philosophy and morals, and in 1644 he dedicated to her his Principia. Many of Descartes's letters to Elisabeth were published in the volumes of his correspondence edited by Claude Clerselier, but Elisabeth refused the request to publish her side of the exchange. Elisabeth's side of the correspondence was first published in 1879 by Louis-Alexandre Foucher de Careil, after he was alerted to its existence by an antiquarian bookseller, Frederick M√ºller, who had found a packet of letters in Rosendael. Elisabeth also corresponded with a number of prominent Quakers, including Robert Barclay and William Penn. There are letters written both by and to her concerning political and financial matters in the English Calendar of State Papers.

(1999). The Princess and the Philosopher: Letters of Elisabeth of the Palatine to Rene Descartes. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Descartes visited The Hague to meet some of the leading intellectual figures in Holland who might support his philosophy. The Hague was often a gathering place to meet other influential, powerful people. As Descartes talked of his ideas, Elisabeth intently listened and became very interested in Descartes' thoughts of the mind and body. After Descartes' visit, it was told to him that Elisabeth had been very interested in his work. Descartes was flattered and told others that he would like to get to know the princess better. Descartes made another visit to The Hague, and was intent on having a conversation with Elisabeth, although this conversation for some reason did not happen. 332x332px Elisabeth, upon hearing of Descartes' failed attempt to converse with her, wrote to Descartes a letter. In this letter, dated May 16, 1643, Elisabeth writes, \\"tell me please how the soul of a human being (it being only a thinking substance) can determine the bodily spirits and so bring about voluntary actions\\".Shapiro, L. (2008). Princess Elizabeth and Descartes: The union of soul and body and the practice of philosophy. British Journal for the History of Psychology, 7(3), 503-520. Elisabeth is questioning Descartes' idea of dualism and how the soul and the body could interact. Elisabeth rightly questioned how something immaterial (Descartes' idea of the mind) could move something material (the body). Descartes replied to Elisabeth's letter with the answer that this interaction should not be thought of as between two bodies and that it is the kind of union that exists between the two qualities of heaviness and bodies. Elisabeth was not satisfied with this answer, so she wrote to Descartes again. In this letter, dated June 20, 1643, Elisabeth writes that she cannot \\"understand the idea through which we must judge how the soul (nonextended and immaterial) is able to move the body, that is, by that idea through which you have at another time understood heaviness ... And I admit that it would be easier for me to concede matter and extension to the mind than it would be for me to concede the capacity to move a body and be moved by one to an immaterial thing.\\" Jaegwon Kim cites this as the first causal argument for the doctrine of physicalism in philosophy of mind.Kim, J. (2009). \\"Mental Causation.\\" In McLaughlin, B., Beckermann, A. and Walter, S., eds., The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Mind (pp. 31). New York: Oxford University Press In another letter from Elisabeth to Descartes dated July 1, 1643, Elisabeth agrees with Descartes that our senses are evidence that the soul does move the body and the body moves the soul, but that this interaction does not teach us anything about how this happens. In Elisabeth's correspondence with Descartes, we can see that Elisabeth assumes that Descartes does have an account of how the soul and body interact and asks for clarification on how the soul does this. In fact, Descartes did not have an exact account of how this happens, but merely assumed the soul had this capability. This particular correspondence between Descartes and Elisabeth ended with this July 1 letter. The correspondence began again, but two years later. In this correspondence, Elisabeth and Descartes discuss an illness Elisabeth suffered from in the summer of 1645. Descartes writes to Elisabeth that he thinks her symptoms are caused by sadness. This could very well have been true, as Elisabeth's brother Philip had challenged a family suitor and then stabbed the suitor in public, resulting in social backlash. This caused Elisabeth much distress and worry. Elisabeth originally intended the letters to be private and has no extant philosophical works. This makes her place in the history of philosophy complex and the subject of debate. This specific correspondence between Elisabeth and Descartes is often ignored by many historians, as they see it as insignificant, but a few regard it as influential in that Descartes and Elisabeth seem to be talking of the \\"passions of the soul\\", as Descartes referred to them. Some historians have remarked that Elisabeth could have been a philosopher in her own right if it had not been for a lack of a systematic presentation of her philosophical position. In addition to Descartes, Elisabeth held correspondence with many others, including various Quakers. Among them most notably were Edward Reynolds, Nicholas Malebranche, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Robert Barclay, and William Penn. While they seemed to have the aim of converting her to their faith, Elisabeth seemed to be focused on the intellectual interest of their ideals and beliefs. She also held a correspondence for a time with the \\"Dutch Minerva\\", Anna Maria van Schurman, who encouraged Elisabeth to further her studies in history, physics, and astronomy. While their correspondence was not extensive, Van Schurman was a mentor to Elisabeth and guided her in her scholarly studies. She was respected and revered by Princess Elisabeth to a great degree. Elisabeth asked for her advice on new topics and subjects of study often. Van Schurman took the initiative in giving Elisabeth her opinion on the new discoveries of their time. The area in which they seemed to diverge was in their opinion of Descartes. Elisabeth was intrigued by the new Cartesian philosophy and wanted to learn more about it. Van Schurman, however, emphatically refuted the idea when Elisabeth inquired about it, instead defending the scholastic traditional view. As much as she respected Van Schurman, this did not stop Elisabeth from pursuing her interest in Descartes and his doctrine. It has been speculated that Elisabeth's correspondence and deep connection with Descartes effectively ended her communications with Van Schurman.Van Dijk, S. & Nesbitt, J. (2004) I Have Heard About You: Foreign Women's Writing Crossing the Dutch Border: From Sappho to Selma Lagerloff. Denmark. Uitgeverij Verloren.  Contributions to the feminist history of philosophy  Elisabeth of Bohemia has been a key subject in the feminist history of philosophy. She has garnered attention as prominent female thinker and for her practical role in the development of 17th century female scholars. Feminist scholars study her correspondences and life to understand the limitations placed on 17th century female thinkers. Some scholars cite Elisabeth as an example of how philosophical conceptions of women as philosophers excluded them from the philosophical canon. For feminist scholars, her correspondence with Descartes presents an example of the value of including women in the canon. Some argue that Elisabeth's correspondence with Descartes helps feminist scholars re-conceptualize how women are to be included in the philosophical canon. Feminist scholars are concerned with how Elisabeth's gender informed her philosophy. Many believe that Elisabeth was keenly aware of the limitations of her sex. One scholar states that Elisabeth's health and femininity informed her interest about the immaterial soul's influence on the material body. Elisabeth's influence also extends to the development of other 17th century female thinkers. She utilized her exile court in The Hague to create a network of female scholars. Her network was a space where women could engage in philosophical inquiry through correspondence. Including Elisabeth, the network consisted of Anna Maria van Schurman, Marie de Gournay, and Lady Ranelagh.

It has a population of c. 21,600 . Its name means \\"Hill of Elsa Valley\\", where Elsa is the name of the river which crosses it and Valdelsa the name of the valley. Today, Colle di Val d'Elsa is internationally renowned for the production of crystal glassware and art (15% of world production), largely produced in the industrial lower town. History Romanesque Pieve of SS. Ippolito and Cassiano. The area was settled by man from at least the 4th millennium BC, but first mentions of the city are from the 9th century AD. In 1269 it was the seat of a famous battle during the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines and in 1479 it was besieged by Neapolitan troops. From the 14th century it was a possession of Florence and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until the unification of Italy in 1860. In the 20th century it became an important industrial center. During World War II it was bombed by Allied aircraft. The oldest part of the town is the \\"colle alta\\", the higher part, with a well-preserved medieval center. The town developed along the river from the 11th century onwards, building an artificial canal to power various industrial activities, such as wheat mills and paper factories. The city is also famous as the birthplace of sculptor and architect Arnolfo di Cambio. The Giottesque painter Cennino Cennini and the poet Isabella Cervoni were also born here. Main sights The village is entered through the ancient and monumental Porta Nova and winds its long and narrow way in a sequence of fine 16th- and 17th-century noble houses (notable are Palazzo Usimbardi, Palazzo Buoninsegni and the Town Hall) to the Palazzo Campana, which marks the entry to the Castle, the oldest part of Colle. Here, the village is characterized by narrow paved lanes, 15th- and 16th-century noble houses (such as Palazzo Luci, Palazzo Morozzi, Palazzo Giusti, Palazzo Dini) and tower-houses, including the one where Arnolfo di Cambio was born.

The R-15 was a project to develop an SLBM for the D-3 missile system with the capability to be launched while submerged. The development was authorized for OKB-586 in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, on 20 March 1958 and cancelled before testing in December 1958.  Development  The Soviet Union's nuclear submarine project began the middle of the 1950s and focused on attaching nuclear warheads to a variety of delivery systems. The Soviet military required the Navy to use nuclear weapons to enhance the effectiveness of naval operation against large ships, naval bases, groups of ships, or other strategic targets. The decree also gave OKB-586, a Russian design office, the task to create the R-15 missile for the D-3 on March 20, 1958. The R-15 missile was planned to have a range of 1,000 kilometers and the design required improvements from the D-1 and D-2 systems. The missile was planned to launch directly from the launch tube unlike the D-1 and D-2, which had to be raised. The R-15 missile was designed for a nuclear submarine in 1958. The Special Design Bureau No. 143(SKB-143) began to design the Project 639 submarine that would use three R-15 missiles. While another design bureau in 1958, Central Design Bureau No. 16, worked on Project V-629 that would use the R-15. Project V-629 designed a diesel submarine that would keep a single R-15 missile on board. Most of the design projects would be halted because the missile's size and weight would not meet performance specifications.

He played for the Philadelphia Phillies, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Houston Astros. High school and college Born in Tampa, Florida, Michaels graduated in 1994 from Jesuit High School in Tampa, a school which also produced major leaguers Lou Piniella, Dave Magadan and Brad Radke. He batted over .400 in each of three years for Jesuit, and was selected in the 49th round of the 1994 Major League Baseball draft by the San Diego Padres. He chose not to sign and instead attended Okaloosa-Walton College, a community college in Niceville, Florida. At Okaloosa-Walton, Michaels hit .421 with 9 home runs and 45 runs batted in, and was named Panhandle Conference Player of the Year in 1996. He graduated from Okaloosa-Walton in 1996, and that year played collegiate summer baseball for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected in the 44th round of the 1996 draft by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, but he again opted not to sign and instead entered the University of Miami. He lettered in baseball for the Hurricanes in both 1997 and 1998, and was a teammate of future major-leaguers Pat Burrell and Aubrey Huff. In two seasons at Miami, he batted .396 with 34 home runs and 154 runs batted in. In 1997, he set Hurricane single-season records for hits (106), doubles (32) and total bases (189). The St. Louis Cardinals selected Michaels in the 15th round of the 1997 amateur draft, but once again he opted not to sign, returning to Miami for his final year of eligibility. In 1998, Michaels was drafted for the fourth time when the Philadelphia Phillies selected him in the 4th round of that year's draft. He signed his first professional contract on June 19, 1998. In 2010, Jason was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. Professional careerPhiladelphia Phillies= In the Phillies farm system from 1998 through , Michaels played for the Batavia Muckdogs of the short-season, single-A New York‚ÄìPenn League (1998), the Clearwater Phillies (now Clearwater Threshers) of the advanced single-A Florida State League (), the Reading Phillies of the double-A Eastern League () and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the triple-A International League (2001). In 424 minor league games with the Phillies, he hit .282 with 52 home runs and 264 RBI. Although he spent most of the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Michaels made his major league debut with Philadelphia on April 6, 2001. He was on the Phillies' 25-man roster from through as a reserve outfielder and pinch hitter, compiling a .291 batting average with 21 home runs and 100 RBI in 383 games and 808 at bats. He was used primarily as a pinch hitter and defensive replacement in 2002 and . In , he was the team's fourth outfielder behind fellow University of Miami alumnus Pat Burrell, Marlon Byrd, and Bobby Abreu. In 2005, he platooned in center field with left-handed hitting Kenny Lofton. =Cleveland Indians= On January 27, 2006, the Phillies traded Michaels to the Cleveland Indians for left-handed relief pitcher Arthur Rhodes. This trade precipitated a second deal in which the Indians sent outfielder Coco Crisp, relief pitcher David Riske and catcher Josh Bard to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for reliever Guillermo Mota, third baseman Andy Marte, catcher Kelly Shoppach, Randy Newsom and cash. Michaels replaced Crisp in left field for the Indians in 2006, hitting primarily in the second spot in the batting order behind Grady Sizemore. For the season, he hit .267 with nine home runs and a career-best 55 RBI. He missed 16 games after crashing into the outfield wall at Yankee Stadium on June 15. Michaels's struggles against right-handed pitching in 2006 (.252, 4 HR, 28 RBI in 338 plate appearances compared to .291, 5 HR, 27 RBI in 210 plate appearances against left-handers) prompted the Indians to sign left-handed hitting, free agent outfielder David Dellucci after the 2006 season. Dellucci and Michaels were expected to platoon in left field in , with Michaels seeing most of his playing time against left- handed pitching. Roberto Clemente Award Nominee On September 6, 2006, the Indians announced that Michaels was their nominee for the prestigious Roberto Clemente Award, given annually to the major league player who best exemplifies a commitment to community service. Michaels donated the $2,500 award to the Cleveland chapter of Gang Resistance Education and Training. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On May 8, 2008, Michaels was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates after being designated for assignment. =Houston Astros= On December 15, 2008, Michaels was signed to a one-year, $750K contract by the Astros.Astros sign Jason Michaels to one-year deal Michaels re-signed with the Astros the following year.Michaels re-signs with Astros On October 4, 2010, the Astros exercised a $900,000 club option for 2011.

He was created by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger as part of Archie's \\"Archie Adventure Series\\". This happened prior to that comics line being camped up as part of their Mighty Comics imprint. The Jaguar is zoologist Ralph Hardy. While on a dig in Peru, (Hardy, like most Silver Age heroes, is a man of many interests and talents, including archeology), a giant serpent burst forth from the ground and began terrorizing the area. While the others fled, Hardy followed a rare white jaguar into a ruined temple and found a series of cave drawings depicting the ancient Incas battling the same monster, as well as a mystical \\"nucleon energy belt\\". The round golden buckle of the belt had the engraved image of a winged Jaguar on the front and on the back an inscription which read: \\"He who loves the animal kingdom may wear this belt and be transformed into a human Jaguar\\". Hardy put on the belt and was instantly transformed. As The Jaguar, he possesses, in addition to the expected feline abilities, all the powers of the animal kingdom, only a thousand times more powerful. The oft-quoted \\"magnified toughness of a rhinoceros' hide\\", for example, gives him near Superman-level invulnerability. He also has the Aquaman-style telepathic ability to mentally communicate with and command all animals, including those from alien worlds. The Jaguar wears a simple, skintight scarlet bodysuit with a flared black collar and the stylized suggestion of a feline face (just the eyes, whiskers, and open mouth) on the chest and jaguar pelt-patterned boots and nucleon belt. The latter has two small rocket packs on either side which gives him the power of supersonic flight. He wears no mask and looks exactly like Ralph Hardy, except that Hardy has a mustache, while The Jaguar does not. (Post-Silver Age comics artists tend to give the latter pointed ears and a more cat-like hairstyle, making him vaguely resemble a cross between the Sub-Mariner and the movie version of Wolverine.) In many ways The Jaguar is a copy of earlier Archie Comics hero The Fly: magic belt instead of magic ring, powers of the animal kingdom rather than the insect kingdom, etc. The Jaguar first appeared two years after The Fly was introduced. Unlike The Fly, however, The Jaguar is handsome and has many recurring romantic entanglements. These include the immortal feline sorceress Cat Girl, who had command over the cat kingdom, just as he ruled over the whole animal kingdom. (She was also known as The Sphinx and had originally battled The Fly, but it was quickly decided that she would be a more appropriate foe for The Jaguar.) There is also the green-skinned and white-haired undersea siren Kree-Nal, and Hardy's secretary Jill Ross. Like Pete Ross, she secretly knows that Hardy is her beloved hero The Jaguar and uses that knowledge to help him without him knowing it. Nor were these relationships static; in later stories, Jill left to study nursing so that she could better assist in Hardy's veterinary work. Cat Girl lost her magic powers due to exposure to highly toxic strontium-90 from atomic testing, retaining only her telepathic mastery over cats. She took on the new mortal identity of jet-set socialite Lydia Fellin, whose \\"family fortune\\" was actually a vast treasure trove that she had accumulated over the centuries. The Jaguar appeared in 15 issues of The Adventures of the Jaguar, as well as a backup feature in other Archie titles: Jughead Jones Comic Digest 7; Laugh Comics 127, 130, 131, 133, 135, 140‚Äì142, 144; Laugh Comics Digest 25, 27; Pep Comics 150, 152, 157, 159, and 168. The Jaguar also appears in The Adventures of the Fly #23. When the \\"Archie Adventure Series\\" line was canceled and reborn as Archie's \\"camped up\\" Mighty Comics line, The Jaguar only made brief appearances in Mighty Crusaders #4 and 5. In #5 The Jaguar would team up with Mr. Justice and Steel Sterling as the \\"Terrific Three\\". The Jaguar would again appear as part of Archie's Red Circle Comics revamp in the 1980s, as a founding member of the new Mighty Crusaders. He was also a backup series in The Fly issues 4‚Äì9. In this incarnation it was revealed that the source of The Jaguar's powers was the cherubim-like pre-human god Varigon, Lord of the Animals, a towering golden-winged being with three heads: a bird, a lion, and a bull. Varigon had created the magic belt as a weapon to be worn by his mortal champion in the eternal battle against the scaly green lizard-headed S'ithh, Lord of the Reptiles, who wanted the dinosaurs to rule the Earth once again. The first person to have worn the belt in ancient times was an Incan woman. It is later revealed that Ralph is the brother of Rose Raymond, the wife of fellow superhero The Web. The most recent appearances of the Ralph Hardy Jaguar have been cameos in Archie's Weird Mysteries #3 and 14 and a cover story crossover appearance in Sabrina the Teenage Witch #30. A teenage female version of The Jaguar, written by William Messner-Loebs, was used in DC Comics' Impact revamp of the Archie superheroes. She is naive and good-hearted Maria DeGuzman, who came to North America from Rio de Janeiro to study at Elm Harbor University. To her surprise, she inherited from her late aunt the werewolf-like ability to transform into a large, muscular, barefoot and green- eyed Jaguar. Despite wearing a similar, somewhat skimpier skintight red outfit, unlike her male namesake, this ferocious feline's powers are limited to superhuman strength and agility combined with cat-like claws and senses. She eventually marries Impact's version of The Fly at the end of the Crucible miniseries. In the aftermath of the continuity-altering Final Crisis, DC comics once again licensed the Red Circle heroes, this time choosing to bring them directly into the DC Universe. In March 2010 a new Jaguar was set to appear in The Shield #5, a Brazilian man who could transform into a red tattoo-covered \\"werejaguar\\". In New Crusaders the role of The Jaguar in the short-lived Red Circle digital comics universe was passed to Ralph Hardy's young apprentice Ivette \\"Ivy\\" Velez when the shy, Spanish-speaking orphan was given the cat-like golden helmet of Ai Apaec to become the savage new Jaguar.

People who confirmed a relationship with an existing user but did not go on to register with the site continued to receive occasional email updates and solicitations. Users could send messages and post bulletin board items to people in their first, second, and third degrees, and see their connection to any other user on the site.

Life Born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, he was the oldest son of John Bourinot. He was educated at Sydney before enrolling at Trinity College, Toronto, in 1854. Although he was a good student, he left the university two years later and worked as a parliamentary reporter for a Toronto newspaper. In 1860, he was in Halifax, where he founded, together with Joseph C. Crosskill, his own newspaper, the Evening Reporter. In May 1867, Bourinot left this newspaper and worked as a freelance writer for some time, until he secured a job as a clerk at the Senate of Canada in May 1869. In the following years, he steadily advanced through various grades until he was appointed chief clerk of the House of Commons of Canada in December 1880. a post he would occupy until his death 22 years later. A founding member of the Royal Society of Canada, he also acted as its honorary secretary, and in 1892 served as president of the society. He wrote many books political history, some of which were considered references for decades to come. His Parliamentary Procedure and Practice in Canada (Montr√©al, 1884) is considered a standard work, and was cited as recently as 24 October 2013 by the Speaker of the Senate, the Honourable Noel Kinsella.Senate Hansard, \\"ORDERS OF THE DAY Speaker's Rulings Motion No. 2 and Motion to Refer to a Committee\\" 24 Oct 2013, 15h10 How Canada is governed (Toronto, 1895) was a widely used textbook, and Canada under British rule, 1760 - 1900 (Cambridge, England, 1900) was also popular. He also wrote books about the history of Nova Scotia, and several more on constitutional law. He also created the work that was posthumously to be called Bourinot's Rules of Order. Bourinot was an advocate of Imperial Federation and a proponent of both a national university and library of Canada. He also was in favour of the right of women to higher education. In his later life, Bourinot received honorary degrees from many Canadian universities and was created CMG in 1890 and KCMG in 1898.

He is famous for his work on the history of the Royal Air Force, including the three-volume official history of the service during World War II, which was co-written with Hilary St. George Saunders. Richards came from London and was educated at Owen's School and Trinity Hall, Cambridge. In 1931 he graduated from Cambridge University with a double first in history. For the next eight years he was a master at Manchester Grammar School, teaching both history and English. From 1939 to 1941 he taught the same subjects at Bradfield College, near Reading, as a senior tutor. War service then called him and he joined the RAF. Within a very short time he was ordered to report to the historical section of the Air Ministry. His staff eventually came to number 40, and he held the position of senior narrator from 1943 to 1947. He began to write the official history of the RAF during World War II when he was the senior narrator. It was eventually published in three volumes in 1953 and 1954. In 1947 he was promoted within the Air Ministry to a principal, a post in which he remained until 1950. Richards published in his lifetime more than a dozen books, half on RAF history.https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/1055730.Denis_Richards After his time in the RAF, and whilst completing the official history, he became involved with Morley College in south London. He worked strenuously to raise funds for the rebuilding of the institution. The college benefitted from paintings he commissioned, and many young musicians later to find fame, took part in concerts he staged. He had a number of hobbies, including snooker and golf. He was heavily involved with Hampstead Golf Club after joining it in 1951. He also engaged in voluntary work, chairing the Women's League for Health and Beauty for 22 years between 1966 and 1988 and also acting as a vice president of the Purcell School of Young Musicians from 1984 until his death. He continued to publish works into his old age, and he was awarded the OBE in 1990.

It is based on the eponymous 2001 novel by Richard Russo. The miniseries was nominated for and won multiple awards, including various Primetime Emmy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. It is directed by Fred Schepisi. Plot Set in the small, decaying, nearly bankrupt town of Empire Falls, Maine, this is the story of Miles Roby, the unassuming manager of the Empire Grill, who has spent his entire life in the town. He has an ex-wife, Janine, who has become a cocky, selfish bachelorette after losing weight and exercising rigorously. This is partly due to encouragement from Walt Comeau, an antagonistic fitness center owner who visits the Empire Grill every day and has moved into Roby's old house by this point. Roby also has a loving teenage daughter, nicknamed \\"Tick\\", who is dealing with Zack Minty, her cruel ex- boyfriend, plus an emotional conflict over her mother's engagement to Walt, whom Tick despises. In addition, she has a complicated friendship with John Voss, an emotionally disturbed boy at school whose hard-luck story is known all too well around town. The obnoxious jock Zack and his friends constantly bully John. Other important people in Miles' life include Max, his grubby ne'er-do-well father, a rascal who can't resist a handout when it comes his way; David, Miles' reformed marijuana smoking brother, who is a talented Empire Grill cook; Bea, Miles' good-hearted ex-mother-in-law, who owns a bar; the town's wealthiest woman, a condescending matron who owns the Empire Grill; that woman's daughter, who has loved Miles for many years; an attractive waitress; a retiring police chief; and a dimwitted police officer, who is Zack's father and has known Miles since childhood. Miles is plagued by flashbacks of his family when he was a child, including a mysterious affair between his mother and a suitor, the details of which might answer some questions Miles has had his entire life. Characters * Miles Roby (Ed Harris) ‚Äì The middle-aged central character of the story. Miles is the seemingly content manager of the Empire Grill in Empire Falls, Maine and is divorced with one teenaged daughter. A blue-collar gentleman with his principles intact, he lives in an apartment over the restaurant he has managed ever since he dropped out of college to look after his dying mother. However, this has left him constantly accountable to Francine Whiting, causing others to persuade him to open a business of his own. * Janine Roby (Helen Hunt) ‚Äì Miles' ex-wife. She has developed a selfish attitude, damaging her relationship with her daughter and annoying her mother. She gained ownership of the house and custody of their daughter while Miles ended up in an apartment above the Empire Grill. Janine resents the close relationship that exists between father and daughter. As the story progresses, Janine finds that tables are turning on her for the worst. * Christina \\"Tick\\" Roby (Danielle Panabaker) ‚Äì Miles' daughter. She enjoys a loving relationship with both her father and grandfather. Tick is smart, friendly, and more sympathetic than most of her classmates. Her mother's engagement has a negative impact on her. She despises Walt, who is trying to act like a father figure, and resents her mother. * Max Roby (Paul Newman) ‚Äì Miles' father. Disheveled and constantly defiant of those around him, Max has no problem saying what he thinks of people, even directly to their faces. He is happy to accept any \\"handout\\" (or to take anything he wants) even when it means stealing money from the church. Max has a lifelong affinity for Key West, Florida. Despite being a vagabond, Max loves his sons and granddaughter and is a great deal wiser than people assume him to be. (This was Paul Newman's final onscreen role. He is played by Josh Lucas in flashback) * Charlie Mayne (Philip Seymour Hoffman) ‚Äì A mysterious suitor to Miles' mother and a symbolic figure in Miles' life. Charlie's involvement is pivotal with regard to why Miles has lived in Empire Falls his entire life. * Grace Roby (Robin Wright Penn) ‚Äì Miles' late mother. She considers her son the jewel of her eye. Her affair with Charlie plays a crucial role in Miles' life. * Francine Whiting (Joanne Woodward) ‚Äì The town's wealthiest citizen. The manipulative Francine holds puppet strings over the town, in particular Miles, and has no problem pulling them when it suits her unscrupulous agenda. Her condescending manner veils a cunning woman with ulterior motives. * David Roby (Aidan Quinn) ‚Äì Miles' younger brother. A former alcoholic, a reformed marijuana plant grower and a car-crash survivor, David is the chief cook at the Empire Grill. His talent brings a considerable amount of business to the diner. He encourages Miles to take risks, having promised their mother to watch after Miles. It is also implied that David is actually Miles's half-brother, through flashbacks with their mother and Charlie Mayne. * Walt Comeau (Dennis Farina) ‚Äì Janine's fiance and the owner of a fitness club. Walt is extroverted and arrogant. He lives with Janine in Miles' old house, trying to develop a fatherly relationship with Tick. Walt makes daily appearances at the restaurant to challenge Miles to an arm- wrestling match. He has a couple of skeletons in his closet, hidden (temporarily) from Janine. * John Voss (Lou Taylor Pucci) ‚Äì Tick's awkward, introverted classmate. He is from a deprived family, wears ragged, dirty clothing and is known to live with his grandmother after his parents abandoned him. He's constantly ridiculed by Tick's ex-boyfriend, Zack Minty. His history has created a dangerous aura about him, one that eventually escalates. No one but Tick pays enough attention to him until it's too late. * Cindy Whiting (Kate Burton) ‚Äì Francine's daughter. Despite being permanently disabled by a car accident, she is a sweet woman with high spirits. She has a long-standing attraction to Miles; he is aware of it and is sympathetic but does not feel the same way. * Jimmy Minty (William Fichtner) ‚Äì A dull-witted, unscrupulous police officer and former classmate of Miles. He is not well liked by most of the town, although he believes he is. Francine keeps him in her pocket by providing perks such as a red sports car. He has an eye on becoming chief of police one day, and unfortunately, has keys to most of the town's businesses which he uses to his advantage. He and Miles ultimately come to blows. * Zack Minty (Trevor Morgan) ‚Äì Son of Jimmy Minty, Tick's ex-boyfriend and a high school bully. A football star who is an obnoxious and cruel punk, Zack gets away with his bad behavior because of his popularity and his father's status as a police officer. He loves tormenting John to the point of breaking into his house, and is indirectly responsible for making John reach his breaking point. * Bea (Estelle Parsons) ‚Äì Janine's wise mother. Ex-mother-in-law to Miles, they remain good friends. Bea frequently takes Miles' side rather than Janine's, and often makes rather pointed remarks about Janine's behavior. She owns a local bar and wants Miles to go into business with her. * Charlene (Theresa Russell) ‚Äì Waitress at the Empire Grill. She is aware that Miles is attracted to her, and she's kind to him, but she is dating David. * Bill Daws (Stephen Mendillo) ‚Äì The compassionate chief of police and a friend to Miles. He is dying of cancer and is undergoing chemotherapy which takes a heavy toll on his health, confiding only in Miles with the news. * Horace (Jeffrey DeMunn) ‚Äì A local reporter and a regular patron at the grill. He is an intellectual with a heavy Maine accent and has intimate knowledge of what goes on around town. He has a prominent cyst on his forehead and Max often tactlessly refers to it. * Father Mark (Adam LeFevre) ‚Äì A friendly priest. He works at a decrepit church, which he has hired Miles to paint. * Father Tom (Nesbitt Blaisdell) ‚Äì An elderly priest. He is becoming senile and behaves erratically. (For example, at one point he helps Max steal money from the church) * Otto Meyer (Larry Pine) ‚Äì Principal of the high school. A childhood friend of Miles, he is an honorable man who watches out for students like John and Tick. He plays a pivotal role when John \\"snaps.\\" (Pine also serves as narrator for the film) * Candace (Delia Robertson) ‚Äì Tick's classmate and best friend. She finds some amusement when Zack picks on John, but is inevitably involved when John reaches his breaking point. * Justin (Tony Takacs) ‚Äì Zack's best friend. Overweight, with a penchant for junk food, he participates with Zack in taunting John, although he draws limits when Zack breaks into John's house. He, too, is affected by John's revenge.

Wells & Co. of Blackwell launched her on 29 November 1792 for the British East India Company (EIC) as the East Indiaman Glatton. The Royal Navy bought her in 1795 and converted her into a warship. Glatton was unusual in that for a time she was the only ship-of-the-line that the Royal Navy had armed exclusively with carronades. (Eventually she returned to a more conventional armament of guns and carronades.) She served in the North Sea and the Baltic, and as a transport for convicts to Australia. She then returned to naval service in the Mediterranean. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars the Admiralty converted her to a water depot at Sheerness. In 1830 the Admiralty converted Glatton to a breakwater and sank her at Harwich. East India Company service In 1793-4 Glatton made one round trip to China for the East India Company. Her captain was Charles Drummond and her First Lieutenant was William Macnamarra. Drummond had commanded an earlier Glatton and would command a later one too; Macnamarra too would go on to command a later Glatton on a trip to China for the Company. Glattons letter of marque was dated 22 August 1793. The letter of marque permitted her, while under Drummond's command, to assist in the capture of the French brig Le Franc. It was issued after Glatton had left Portsmouth on 22 May 1793. Glatton was part of a convoy that also included the East Indiamen Prince William, Lord Thurlow, William Pitt, , Earl of Oxford, , Fort William, London, , , Marquis of Landsdown, , , and Earl of Abergavenny, amongst numerous other vessels, merchant and military, most of the non-Indiamen travelling to the Mediterranean.Gentleman's magazine (May 1793), Vol 63, part. 1, p. 474. From Portsmouth, Glatton reached Manilla on 10 November, and then Whampoa two weeks later. On her return voyage, she crossed Second Bar on 17 February 1794, reached St Helena on 18 June, and Long Reach by 12 September.National Archives - Glatton (3) The next East Indiaman Glatton, also sailing with a letter of marque, captured a Dutch prow in the Straits of Flores in 1796, and the ship Copenhagen in 1799. Fitting out for Royal Navy service Captain Henry Trollope commissioned her in April 1795 and he was responsible for arranging that her original armament consisted entirely of carronades instead of the standard mix of long guns and carronades that other warships carried. His previous command, some eight years earlier, had been the 44-gun Rainbow, which too had been armed entirely with carronades. With her Trollope had in 1782 taken the H√©b√©, which the British would go to use as the model for the Leda-class frigates. Carronades had short, relatively thin barrels and so were half the weight of the equivalent cannon. They did not need as large gun crews and could also fire much heavier shot for their weight than a gun of the same overall weight, but at the cost of the accuracy, velocity and range of the shot. This extremely heavy armament meant that the fourth rate Glatton could discharge a heavier broadside than the first rate Victory. But, in combat Glatton would have to endure the fire of the enemy's long guns while closing the gap to point-blank range before she could effectively return fire -- if indeed the enemy would allow her to approach so close. Glatton was originally armed with twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck and twenty-eight 42-pounder carronades on her upper deck. All were non-recoil, which is to say that they were fixed to the deck. Within a month 32-pounder carronades replaced the 42-pounders. However, Glatton's ports were too small to allow the larger guns to traverse properly, and she had no bow or stern chasers. Her guns therefore could only be pointed straight out the side. The month after the action in July 1796 (see below), she received two 32-pounders and two 18-pounder carronades for her forecastle. Later, the Navy replaced the twenty-eight 68-pounder carronades on the lower deck with twenty-eight 18-pounder long guns, ending the experiment. Trollope was extremely happy with Glattons seaworthiness, handling and general fitting out. He wrote to John Wells, the shipbuilder and her former owner,Gentleman's magazine, (17 September 1817), Vol. 122, p.212. \\"I sincerely hope... we may meet with a seventy four in the Glatton...she would either take her or sink her in twenty minutes.\\"Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, pp.288-9. North Sea and Baltic Captain Sir Henry Trollope Under Trollope, Glatton first served in the English Channel where she engaged a French squadron on 15 July 1796. The French squadron consisted of a 50-gun ship, five frigates (two of 36 guns and three of 28), a brig, and a cutter. Glatton drove the French vessels into Flushing, having lost only two men wounded, one of whom died later, and despite having at times been surrounded by the enemy and exchanging fire at less than 20 yards. The French vessels may have included Brutus (a 74-gun cut down to 46-50 guns), Incorruptible (50 guns), Magicienne (32 guns), and R√©publicaine, and one French vessel apparently sunk in Flushing harbour. (It was in this action that Captain Strangeways of the Royal Marines sustained the wound of which he died shortly thereafter, and which the illustration above commemorates.) In March‚ÄìApril 1797, Trollope kept Glattons crew from joining the Nore mutiny. By threatening to fire on the 64-gun and the 40-gun , which were in open mutiny, he convinced their crews to return to duty.Lee et al. (1899), Vol. 57, p.247. In August Captain Charles Cobb took command. In April and May 1798 Glatton participated, with many other vessels, in the capture of sundry Dutch doggers, schuyts, and fishing vessels. On 4 and 5 May Glatton was among the vessels that captured 12 outward-bound Greenland ships. The other vessels included the hired armed cutters Fox and Marshall Cobourg, though most were much larger and included , , , , among others. On 28 May Glatton, , Ganges, America, , , Director, , the hired armed cutters Fox the First, and Rose when they captured Janus. All the British vessels were part of the fleet under the command of Admiral Lord Duncan. Next, many of the same vessels, including Glatton, , Fox the First and Rose, captured several more Dutch vessels: *Hoop (6 June); *Stadt Embden (11 June); *Neptune (12 June); *Rose and Endrast (14 June); *Hoop (15 June); and *Vrow Dorothea (l6 June). On 18 August 1798, Glatton, Veteran, Belliqueux, Monmouth, , Ganges, , , the sloop , and the hired armed cutter Rose captured Adelarde. Glatton was with other ships from Duncan's fleet, including , , , the hired armed lugger Rover, and cutters Liberty and Hazard, when they captured Harmenie on 21 April 1799. Glatton was in company with Kent, , and when they captured the Dutch hoy Johanna on 16 May 1799. Then in August 1799, Glatton participated in the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland. The expedition was under the command of Admiral Adam Duncan and the Duke of York. Some 250 craft of all sizes transported 17,000 troops from Margate Roads and the Downs across the Channel on 13 August. Due to bad weather it was 21 August before they anchored off Kijkduin. The next day Vice Admiral Mitchell sent a summons to Vice Admiral Samuel Story, calling on him to surrender his fleet. When he declined, the Duke of York landed his army near Den Helder on 27 August under covering fire from the fleet. Den Helder was occupied the following day when the garrison evacuated the town. The expedition then took possession of 13 old warships laid up in ordinary. On 30 August, Glatton, , , Veteran, , Belliqueux, Monmouth and Overyssel, the Russian ship Mistisloff and the frigates, anchored in line ahead in the Vlieter and Mitchel again summoned Story. This time Story agreed to surrender his squadron of 12 modern warships. The Royal Navy purchased 11 of these. The Dutch surrender, without any resistance, became known as the Vlieter Incident. As a result of the surrender, Duncan's fleet was awarded prize money, in which Glatton shared. On 15 January 1800 a court martial on board Glatton, in Yarmouth Roads, tried Lieutenant James Watson, and the surviving officers and crew for the loss on the Cockle Sands of the 12-gun brig as she left Yarmouth Roads via the Northern Passage for Leith. Eight of the crew had been lost in the incident. The court absolved Watson, his officers, and men for the loss of the vessel, and praised their conduct after the wrecking.On 7 April 1800 the Lords of the Admiralty awarded 150 guineas to the fishermen from Winterton who risked their lives to save 30 crew men. The first two men who volunteered each received 25 guineas. In November, Captain George Stephen took command of Glatton, followed in 1801 by Captain William Bligh, formerly of HMS Bounty. Bligh was only captain for about a month, but during that month he sailed her to the Baltic where Glatton participated in the Battle of Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The battle cost her 17 killed and 34 wounded. In 1847 the Admiralty would award the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \\"Copenhagen 1801\\" to all surviving claimants from the action. Glatton was next under Captain William Nowell and then under Captain William Birchall. In August 1801 she was fitted at Sheerness for a guardship in protected waters. Captain John Ferris Devonshire took command that same month. Convict transport to Australia Captain Nathaniel Portlock Captain Nathaniel Portlock recommissioned her in May 1802 as a convict ship. Next, Commander James Colnett assumed command and on 23 September Glatton left England, carrying over 270 male, and 135 female prisoners; of these, seven men and five women died on the journey. She also carried some 30 Free Settlers. A family from the Royal Household boarded the Glatton - this was one of the reasons a Royal Navy vessel was used, to ensure a safe passage. She sailed via a resupply stop at Rio de Janeiro to the penal settlement at Sydney, where she arrived on 13 March 1803. When Glatton arrived about 100 of the people on board her were suffering to varying degrees from scurvy.Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser, 1803. She then returned to England, arriving on 22 September 1803, that is, after an absence of 364 days. Because she returned via Cape Horn, she had circumnavigated the world; her actual time at sea for this transit was 277 days.Marshall (1827), Supplement, Part 1, p.109. Glatton was one of only two Royal Navy ships used to transport convicts to Port Jackson. Return to naval service Between November and December 1803 she was refitted at Woolwich for service as a man-of-war. Still under Colnett's command, she then served briefly as flagship for Rear Admiral James Vashon. In 1804 Glatton was reduced to a 44-gun fifth rate. On 11 November she, together with , , , , Africiane, , , the hired armed cutter Swift, and the hired armed lugger Agnes, shared in the capture of Upstalsboom, H.L. De Haase, Master. Captain Thomas Seccombe recommissioned Glatton in March 1806 and sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 November. On 19 February 1807, Glatton captured the Turkish vessels San Giovanni Pidomias and Codro Mariolo. That same day Glatton and captured the San Michelle. Four days later, Hirondelle captured Madonna, with Glatton sharing by agreement. On 26 February Hirondelle captured the San Nicollo, and Glatton again shared by agreement. On 1 March, boats from Glatton cut out a former French corvette in Turkish service from the port of Sigri on the island of Mitylene. The vessel was pierced for 18 guns but only 10 were mounted. The British boarding party lost five officers and men killed and nine men wounded. provided support. The next day Glatton and Hirondelle captured three other Turkish vessels, names unknown but with masters, Statio, Constantine, and Papeli. Prize money for these vessels, and San Michelle, was paid in October 1816. On 4 March Glatton and Hirondelle captured another Turkish vessel. One week later, Glatton captured yet another Turkish vessel, name unknown, Ibrahim, master. Then on 29 November Glatton captured several transports off Corfu that were transferring troops from Otranto to Corfu. Glatton removed some 300 troops before she destroyed the nine vessels they had been on. Two vessels escaped back to Otranto. Glatton and the brig-sloop had received information that the French had captured four Sicilian gunboats and taken them into Scylla, near Reggio, Calabria. On 31 January 1808, as Delight approached the port, a strong current pushed her towards the shore and she grounded. Seccombe went on board Delight to supervise the recovery effort. As they were trying to free Delight, her boats and those of Glatton came under intense fire from the shore. The boats were unsuccessful in freeing Delight, and Delights captain, Commander Phillip Crosby Handfield, late of Egyptienne, and many of his crew were killed. Although the crew took to the boats, not all were able to escape and a number of the men on her, including Seccombe, became prisoners of war. The French paroled Seccombe, who had been severely wounded, to Messina, where he died on 3 February 1808. Glatton came under the command of Commander Henry Hope (acting) and in March 1808 under Commander Charles Irving (acting). Captain George Miller Bligh then took command around December. He brought a convoy home from Malta in July and then sailed her to Sheerness for laying up in October. She sailed briefly to the Baltic in 1811. Fate From 1812 to 1814 Glatton was under R. G. Peacock (master) at Portsmouth. In 1814 she was converted to serve as a water depot at Sheerness. Between April and June 1830 she was fitted at Sheerness as a breakwater, and in October 1830 Glatton sailed for the last time, to Harwich, where she was subsequently scuttled to serve as a breakwater.

The website of Cornell University Plantations contained, on September 3, 2005, a description of the woods, and used the name Redbud Woods, so it had some official status at Cornell under this name.  History  Early in Cornell's history, at the turn of the 20th century, banker and hardware magnate Robert H. Treman, Class of 1878, built his family estate on University Hill, just west of today's West Campus. Treman hired his friend Warren Manning, a pioneer of American landscape architecture, to design the site. The Ithaca Daily News of November 2, 1901 reported that the west lawn would be \\"left to nature as the best gardener.\\" Upon his death in 1937, Treman, who preserved all of the Ithaca area's gorges, donated $5000 to the University specifically for the beautification of the campus. Much of his west lawn grew into the Redbud Woods, which retains many original Manning design elements and boasts locally rare yellow oak and hackberry trees as well as an unusually dense stand of redbuds. Redbud Woods was part of the landscaping of Robert H. Treman's historic estate. In the late 19th century Warren Manning designed the landscape of the Treman family estate (now Von Cramm Hall, 660, and the Kahin Center) so that it would grow into natural woodlands and beautify the campus. The woods, if left to grow untouched, might eventually reach the stage of a climax forest. Over time, Redbud Woods became perceived as a buffer between the University and the surrounding community. In 1970, the University proposed to construct a parking lot behind Von Cramm Hall. However, this proposal was dropped after by protests led by Gordon G. Chang.  2005 controversy  Background = As part of its \\"West Campus Residential Initiative,\\" Cornell decided to relocate approximately 176 parking spots to the area occupied by the Redbud Woods, about 2 blocks from the new dorms. However, in 2001, the Ithaca Common Council named Redbud Woods a historic district. The University sued the city, and in 2005, the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate division ruled in Cornell's favor, allowing construction of the parking lot to proceed. =Points of view= In the fall of 2004, then University President Jeffrey Lehman had presented three challenges to the University, the third of which was sustainability. Lehman went on to more fully articulate Cornell's \\"institutional commitment to sustainability.\\" Some, including many Cornell faculty, students and Ithaca community members, argued that paving a historic urban green space for a surface parking lot was unsustainable. They suggested that parking needs might be satisfied elsewhere on campus and be further mitigated through demand management, promotion of public transit, and planning. Those in opposition to construction of the lot also argued that paving the woods might increase localized flooding and allow for the leakage of toxic materials, for example motor oil, into the storm sewer system and ultimately into Cayuga Lake, which supplies drinking water for many living in Tompkins County. Major protests around the construction of the parking lot continued through the summer of 2005, including the occupation of President Jeffrey Lehman's office on April 28, 2005 by eight students, as well as a protracted direct action occupation of the woods themselves by students, faculty, and community members, in opposition to what appeared to be imminent destruction. Notably, former Ithaca mayor, and Cornell professor emeritus, Ben Nichols was cited during protests against the deforestation plan. =Final agreement= On July 18, 2005, Cornell University interim president Hunter Rawlings visited Redbud Woods and signed an agreement between the University and many of the Redbud protesters, effectively ending the dispute, although some independent protests continued. Along with a pledge by Cornell to offer free travel passes for buses to all new students entering the University in the fall of 2005 and 2006 who did not purchase parking permits, the agreement included commitments on the university's part to involve the community more in administration decisions, as well as to engage in constructive dialogue concerning sustainability on campus. By August 2005 several thousand new students had taken advantage of the free travel passes, which helped to raise demand on the Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit bus system that services Ithaca and the rest of the county Media documentation The New York Times published three articles about the Redbud Woods controversy in June and July 2005. Locally, The Ithaca Journal and the Cornell Daily Sun published many articles over the course of 2004‚Äì2005 about the protests. Aftermath A key point in the negotiated agreement signed by student protesters (but not community members) was that students receive free travel passes to encourage sustainable transportation. Cornell began this process for incoming students during the semester immediately following the occupation for incoming students, adding to free passes which were already provided to transfer and graduate students. Two years later, free passes for graduate, transfer, and sophomore students were eliminated, and the program only offered going forward to first year students. A faculty and community committee proposed a memorial plaque to the Ithaca Common Council in early 2006, to be placed on public land adjacent to the parking lot. Despite opposition from Cornell University, the City of Ithaca approved the plaque on July 5, 2006, and it was installed later that year. The plaque reads: > Redbud Woods The land before you was once home to the extended family of > Robert H. Treman, creator of parks and protector of green spaces throughout > Tompkins County. The woodland that grew up here was inhabited for decades by > diverse fauna and more than fifty plant species, including numerous redbud > trees. Redbud Woods was razed on July 20, 2005 by the Cornell administration > to build a parking lot. This plaque has been erected by Ithaca community > members in memory of this cherished woodland. Remember the trees‚Ä¶ Remember > all who tried to save them.

Family owned for seven generations, the company's main products are mid-priced to high-end kitchen knives for domestic and professional use. W√ºsthof is one of the leading manufacturers of chef's knives. W√ºsthof's Classic and Grand Prix series have been recognized as top- rated knife series by Consumer Reports. All W√ºsthof knives are made in Solingen, where around 400 of the company's 480 employees work. W√ºsthof's trademark is a trident in a circle. The brand is sold in over 80 countries worldwide. In North America, traditionally the largest market for W√ºsthof products, the company operates two local distribution subsidiaries.  History  Johann Abraham W√ºsthof's Solingen ‚ÄùShears factory, steel and iron works‚Äù is first mentioned in local records in 1814. The factory, one of many of its kind at the time, operated out of a so-called ‚ÄòKotten‚Äô, a small grinding workshop with water-driven grindstones. In the early years, W√ºsthof worked on commission for larger firms and did not yet have its own trademark. Johann Abraham's son, Eduard W√ºsthof, introduced pocket knives as a second mainstay product in 1836. The 1869 company directory listed the firm's purpose as ‚ÄùFactory and warehouse for all kinds of forged shears, pocket and penknives, daggers, table knives and forks, bread, vegetable, butcher knives, etc.‚Äù Eduard's sons, Robert and Eduard, moved the company to the premises the headquarters occupy today, and built a steam engine-powered factory that began production around 1880. In 1881, Robert W√ºsthof took a selection of shears and pocket knives to New York and established the company's first trade relationship with the USA. In 1895, the trident was registered with the Imperial Patent Office in Berlin as the company's trademark. Brand recognition rose as W√ºsthof showcased at industrial and commercial exhibitions both at home and abroad, such as the 1902 D√ºsseldorf exhibition; production increased and further diversified, with facilities for nickel-plating and separate divisions for razor blades, scissors and cutlery. The 1904 W√ºsthof catalogue shows, amongst other wares, 1125 different models of pocket knives on 48 pages. In the 1930s, knife production was switched to stainless steel. Although Solingen was heavily destroyed towards the end of World War II, the W√ºsthof plant remained mostly intact, and production was resumed soon after the war ended. However, the firm's outdated equipment and reliance on manual labour proved to be a liability; in the 1970s, W√ºsthof replaced the old factory building with new facilities with partially-automated production lines, removing pocket knives, shears and cutlery from its product range and concentrating on knives for professional and home use. In 1986, the first robot was installed in the W√ºsthof factory. In 1987, Wusthof-Trident of America, Inc. was founded to serve the company's most important export market. Its sister company, Wusthof-Trident of Canada, was established in 2012. In 2002 and 2014 the second and third production facilities, located in Lindgesfeld (the Solingen business park), came into operation, and in 2019, W√ºsthof opened its first branded store, also in Solingen.  Company overview  W√ºsthof knives have been made in Solingen by the family-owned operation since 1814. The company is currently headed by cousins Harald W√ºsthof and Viola W√ºsthof. It operates three production facilities and an R&D; department in the ‚ÄúCity of Blades‚Äù, where all W√ºsthof knives are designed and manufactured. The company's international distribution network comprises over 80 countries; around 80 % of W√ºsthof's revenues are generated outside Germany. In the US and Canada, distribution is coordinated by the subsidiaries Wusthof Trident of America Inc. (WUSA), headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, and Wusthof Trident of Canada (WCAN), located in Ottawa. W√ºsthof regularly exhibits at international trade fairs such as Maison et Objet (Paris), Ambiente (Frankfurt), International Home + Housewares Show (Chicago) or Spring Fair (Birmingham).  Production  The W√ºsthof production facilities in Solingen are highly automated, with more than 100 robots performing many steps in the knife-making process, while specific tasks such as the finishing of the edges and surfaces, and the final honing of the blade, are still completed manually. Most W√ºsthof knives are precision-forged, except for the laser-cut (stamped) Gourmet, Silverpoint and Urban Farmer series. Forged and stamped knives differ in the steps employed to manufacture the knife blanks: the basic shape and the integral bolster of forged blades are precision forged in a die at 2200 ‚Ñâ (1200 ¬∞C) and then hardened at 1920 ‚Ñâ (1500 ¬∞C), while stamped blanks are laser-cut from a stainless steel plate. W√ºsthof forged knives have more than 40 steps in their manufacturing process; stamped W√ºsthof knives have 14. For blade sharpening, W√ºsthof employs its proprietary automated PEtec procedure (‚ÄúPrecision Edge technology‚Äù): the optimum tilt of the blade during the automated sharpening process is computed based on individual laser measurements of each blade, thus ensuring consistent results. German-style knives are sharpened to an angle of 14 degrees per side; Japanese-style knives are sharpened to an angle of 10 degrees per side. = Steel = All W√ºsthof knives, except for the Silverpoint series (made with steel grade X46Cr13), have the formula ‚ÄúX50CrMoV15‚Äù etched into their blade, signifying that the single block of corrosion resistant steel alloy it is made from contains 0.5% carbon, 15% chromium and unspecified smaller amounts of molybdenum and vanadium. X50CrMoV15 is the German DIN standard name of the alloy, with material number (W-Nr standard) 1.4116.

Development Development of the R-15 and R-21 was initially assigned to Mikhail Yangel's Yuzhnoye Design Office (OKB-586) on 20 March 1958. The project was transferred to Viktor Makeyev's SKB-385 on 17 March 1959. It was intended for the Golf-class submarines (Project 629B); the complete missile system was called the D-4 weapon complex. The 4th Research Institute had been conducting trials of underwater missile launch systems since 1955 with modified Scuds but the first successful launch was in 1960 and the first flight of a standard R-21 was in 1962. Over the lifetime of the missile, 193 out of 228 launches were successful.Bukharin (2004) p319 The R-21 was probably the basis for the design of the North Korean No Dong (Rodong-1) missile. Design Unlike Western designs, the R-21 used a cold launch solid rocket to eject the missile from the flooded launch tube before the main motor ignited. This allowed missiles to be launched in a water depth of 40-60m. The propulsion system used an IRFNA-Inhibited red fuming nitric acid-amine fuel, AK-27I/TG-02. The AK-27I oxidizer was a mixture of 73% nitric acid, 27% nitrogen tetroxide, and an iodine inhibitory passivant. The fuel was originally used in the Wasserfall rocket under the name TONKA-250 and consisted of 50% triethylamine and 50% xylidine. This gave the R-21 a range of , double that of first-generation sub-launched missiles. The Naval Institute Guide suggests that the range was initially 1300 km, and extended to 1650 km later in the life of the missile. There was a single warhead of approximately 800 kilotons. Variants * R-21 (4K55) - original design * R-21A (4K55A) - subsequent modification There was some confusion about the SS-N-4/5/6 series of missiles in the West, the SS-N-5 is normally given the NATO reporting name 'Sark' like the SS-N-4 first carried by the Golf submarines,Bukharin (2004) p585 for an example of the use of 'Sark' but some variants were assigned the name 'Serb' normally used for the SS-N-6. Jane's uses 'Sark'. Operational history The missiles replaced first-generation R-11FM and R-13 missiles on some Golf (Project 629) and Hotel (Project 658) class SSBNs, with three missiles per submarine, between 1963 and 1967. They were succeeded from 1967 by Yankee-class submarines carrying 2400 km-range R-27 (SS-N-6 'Serb') missiles.Bukharin (2004) p240 Seven of the eight Hotel I (Project 658) subs were upgraded to Hotel II (Project 658M) standard, which were retired by 1991.Bukharin (2004) p292 Operators ; *North Korean Navy ; *Soviet Navy  See also  * UGM-27 Polaris - the first US ballistic missile that could be launched from a submerged submarine ReferencesExternal links * R-21 / SS-N-5 SERB GlobalSecurity.org has many historical details *www.aviation.ru R-21 R-021 Category:Cold War missiles of the Soviet Union Category:Makeyev Rocket Design Bureau ","title":"R-21 (missile)"},{"id":"2016744","text":"The World Scientists' Warning to Humanity was a document written in 1992 by Henry W. Kendall and signed by about 1,700 leading scientists. 25 years later, in November 2017, 15,364 scientists signed World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice written by William J. Ripple and seven co-authors calling for, among other things, human population planning, and drastically diminishing per capita consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other resources. The Second Notice has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published. First publication In late 1992, the late Henry W. Kendall, a former chair of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) board of directors, wrote the first warning World Scientists' Warning to Humanity, which begins: \\"Human beings and the natural world are on a collision course.\\" A majority of the Nobel Prize laureates in the sciences signed the document; about 1,700 of the world's leading scientists appended their signature. It was sometimes offered in opposition to the Heidelberg Appeal‚Äîalso signed by numerous scientists and Nobel laureates earlier in 1992‚Äîwhich begins by criticizing \\"an irrational ideology which is opposed to scientific and industrial progress, and impedes economic and social development.\\" This document was often cited by those who oppose theories relating to climate change. However, the Heidelberg Appeal offers no specific recommendations and is not an indictment of environmental science: \\"We fully subscribe to the objectives of a scientific ecology for a universe whose resources must be taken stock of, monitored and preserved. But we herewith demand that this stock-taking, monitoring and preservation be founded on scientific criteria and not on irrational pre-conceptions.\\" In contrast, the UCS-led petition contains specific recommendations: \\"We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water. ... We must stabilize population.\\" Second Notice In November 2017, 15,364 scientists signed World Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice written by lead author professor of ecology, William J. Ripple of Oregon State University, along with 7 co-authors calling for, among other things, limiting population growth, and drastically diminishing per capita consumption of fossil fuels, meat, and other resources. The Second Notice included 9 time- series graphs of key indicators, each correlated to a specific issue mentioned in the original 1992 warning, to show that most environmental issues are continuing to trend in the wrong direction, most with no discernible change in rate. The article included 13 specific steps humanity could take to transition to sustainability. The Second Notice has more scientist cosigners and formal supporters than any other journal article ever published. The full warning was published in BioScience and it can still be endorsed on the Scientists Warning website. 2019 warning on climate change In November 2019, a group of more than 11,000 scientists from 153 countries named climate change an \\"emergency\\" that would lead to \\"untold human suffering\\" if no big shifts in action takes place: The emergency declaration emphasized that economic growth and population growth \\"are among the most important drivers of increases in emissions from fossil fuel combustion\\" and that \\"we need bold and drastic transformations regarding economic and population policies\\".

He specializes in painting, stone lithography and sculpture.  Biography  Parkes studied graphic art and painting at the University of Kansas. As a student, Parkes was fascinated by various graphic processes, and he later became proficient in the difficult medium of the colour stone lithograph. Many of his recent works have been produced as Aurographics, limited edition gicl√©e prints. His unique style evolved in isolation, after a period in which he gave up the practice of art altogether and went to India in search of philosophical illumination, a location that he and his wife continue to visit annually. Early on, he painted in the generally abstract expressionist style common among his teachers. However, he later began to draw and paint in a meticulous style of detailed representation. This style is realistic in principle, but often uses magical subject matter, with imagery drawn from a range of traditions including the cabalistic and the tantric. Strange beasts encounter mysterious winged women, good and evil fight out their eternal conflict.

The Fujiwhara effect, sometimes referred to as the Fujiwara effect, Fujiw(h)ara interaction or binary interaction, is a phenomenon that occurs when two nearby cyclonic vortices move around each other and close the distance between the circulations of their corresponding low-pressure areas. The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described the effect. Binary interaction of smaller circulations can cause the development of a larger cyclone, or cause two cyclones to merge into one. Extratropical cyclones typically engage in binary interaction when within of one another, while tropical cyclones typically interact within of each other. Description Diagram of the Fujiwhara effect, showing how 2 tropical cyclones interact with each other. When cyclones are in proximity of one another, their centers will circle each other cyclonically (counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere) about a point between the two systems due to their cyclonic wind circulations. The two vortices will be attracted to each other, and eventually spiral into the center point and merge. It has not been agreed upon whether this is due to the divergent portion of the wind or vorticity advection. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will circle around it. The effect is named after Sakuhei Fujiwhara, the Japanese meteorologist who initially described it in a 1921 paper about the motion of vortices in water. Tropical cyclones Tropical cyclones can form when smaller circulations within the Intertropical Convergence Zone merge. The effect is often mentioned in relation to the motion of tropical cyclones, although the final merging of the two storms is uncommon. The effect becomes noticeable when they approach within of each other. Rotation rates within binary pairs accelerate when tropical cyclones close within of each other. Merger of the two systems (or shearing out of one of the pair) becomes realized when they are within of one another. Extratropical cyclones This satellite loop covering April 26‚Äì28, 2011 shows two extratropical cyclones involved in Fujiwhara interaction across the Midwest and Great Lakes. Binary interaction is seen between nearby extratropical cyclones when within of each other, with significant acceleration occurring when the low-pressure areas are within of one another. Interactions between their circulations at the 500 hPa level (18,000 feet above sea level) behave more predictably than their surface circulations. This most often results in a merging of the two low-pressure systems into a single extratropical cyclone, or can less commonly result in a mere change of direction of one or both of the cyclones. The precise results of such interactions depend on factors such as the size of the two cyclones, their distance from each other, and the prevailing atmospheric conditions around them.

History Haywire was formed in Charlottetown in 1981 by Paul MacAusland (vocals), Marvin Birt (guitar/vocals), David Rashed (keys/vocals), Ronnie Switzer (bass/vocals) and Scott Roberts (drums). Ron \\"Bumble\\" LeBlanc replaced Roberts in 1984, playing with the band through their demo, EP, and three cuts on their debut Attic release before leaving to continue his education. Mac Cole filled the drum seat briefly until Sean Kilbride (a long-time friend of the band) rounded out the line-up. In 1984, they won the \\"Q104 Homegrown\\" (Volume 1) contest; the first prize was the chance to record a single, but the band took the opportunity to invest additional money of their own and record a 5-song EP, Haywire (1985), which eventually sold over 5,000 copies in the Maritimes. In 1985, they won the Labatt's \\"Battle of the Bands\\" competition, and used the $10,000 first prize to record more material. In the summer of 1986, the group signed a recording contract with Canadian independent label Attic Records. Their first full- length album, Bad Boys (1986), went platinum in Canada, while the title track became a Top 40 hit. The following year, they released Don't Just Stand There (1987), which also went platinum and contained their highest charting hit, the hard-driving \\"Dance Desire\\". A promised third video was not forthcoming from the label, so Haywire financed the video for \\"Fire\\" themselves. Throughout the late 1980s, Haywire toured with other popular Canadian rockers such as Helix, Honeymoon Suite and Kim Mitchell. They also represented Canada in the World Popular Song Festival in Japan, where \\"Dance Desire\\" won the award for best song. Despite their success in Canada, and interest from managers Doc McGee (Bon Jovi, M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Skid Row) and Q Prime (Def Leppard, Metallica, Queensr√øche) and label interest from Chrysalis Records, they were unable to secure a U.S. recording contract due to limitations related to their contract with Attic Records. The follow-up album, Nuthouse (1990), was recorded in Norway with producer Bjorn Nessjo. Unsatisfied with the final mix of the album, Haywire flew back to Canada and remixed it themselves; the final result was a harder edged, guitar-driven record. The videos for the first two singles, \\"Short End of a Wishbone\\" & \\"Operator Central\\", were the most expensive Canadian music videos produced that year. Although it hit platinum sales, the album represented a major change in musical direction, and as a result alienated some of the younger fans of the band's first two records. While it did garner significant AOR radio airplay and was well-received, the record company was unenthusiastic about the new direction and following, and as a result Attic halted promotion of the album without a promised third video. The band produced one more album, Get Off (1992), which was critically well-received, but again did not receive adequate support from the record company. Haywire produced the album's first two videos (\\"Get Back\\" and \\"Wanna Be The One\\") for the price of one, with the label promising a third for the single \\"Buzz\\" (their second-highest charting single, at #13) which ultimately was not produced. After prolonged contractual struggles, the group refused to re-sign with Attic; to fulfill Haywire's contractual obligations, Attic released a greatest hits CD in 1993 (entitled Wired: Best of) without the band's input. The band has had their albums re-issued on CD through Unidisc Music. In November 2006, Haywire were awarded the Music Prince Edward Island Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2011, Haywire were presented with the Dr. Helen Creighton 'Lifetime Achievement Award' from the East Coast Music Association (ECMA) Haywire continues to work on a new album and plan a release in 2018.

It has a characteristic odor that has been described as \\"ammoniacal, fishy, shellfish-like\\".Pyrrolidine, The Good Scents Company In addition to pyrrolidine itself, many substituted pyrrolidines are known. Production and synthesisIndustrial production= Pyrrolidine is prepared industrially by the reaction of 1,4-Butanediol and ammonia at a temperature of 165‚Äì200 ¬∞C and a pressure of 17‚Äì21 MPa in the presence of a cobalt- and nickel oxide catalyst, which is supported on alumina. :Reaction of 1,4-butanediol with ammonia to form pyrrolidine and water in the presence of a nickel oxide catalyst supported on alumina The reaction is carried out in the liquid phase in a continuous tube- or tube bundle reactor, which is operated in the cycle gas method. The catalyst is arranged as a fixed-bed and the conversion is carried out in the downflow mode. The product is obtained after multistage purification and separation by extractive and azeotropic distillation. =Laboratory synthesis= In the laboratory, pyrrolidine was usually synthesised by treating 4-chlorobutan-1-amine with a strong base: :Synthesis of pyrrolidine Occurrence Many modifications of pyrrolidine are found in natural and synthetic chemistry. The pyrrolidine ring structure is present in numerous natural alkaloids such as nicotine and hygrine. It is found in many drugs such as procyclidine and bepridil. It also forms the basis for the racetam compounds (e.g. piracetam, aniracetam). The amino acids proline and hydroxyproline are, in a structural sense, derivatives of pyrrolidine. :Nicotine contains an N-methylpyrrolidine ring linked to a pyridine ring. Reactions Pyrrolidine is a base. Its basicity is typical of other dialkyl amines. Relative to many secondary amines, pyrrolidine is distinctive because of its compactness, a consequence of its cyclic structure. Pyrrolidine is used as a building block in the synthesis of more complex organic compounds.

Carbondale, Illinois: Center for Vietnamese Studies, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, 1974. p 10. HistoryCham period (Century II-XV)= Between the seventh and 10th centuries, the Cham (people of Champa) controlled the strategic spice trade and with this came tremendous wealth. The early history of H·ªôi An is that of the Cham. These Austronesian- speaking Malayo-Polynesian peoples created the Champa Empire which occupied much of what is now central and lower Vietnam, from Hu·∫ø to beyond Nha Trang. Various linguistic connections between Cham and the related Jarai language and the Austronesian languages of Indonesia (particularly Acehnese), Malaysia, and Hainan has been documented. In the early years, M·ªπ S∆°n was the spiritual capital, Tr√† Ki·ªáu was the political capital and H·ªôi An was the commercial capital of the Champa Empire - later, by the 14th century, the Cham moved further down towards Nha Trang. The river system was used for the transport of goods between the highlands, inland countries of Laos and Thailand and the low lands. =Vietnamese period= H·ªôi An in early 17th century In 1306, Vietnamese and Cham signed a land treaty, which Cham king Jaya Simhavarman III gave Dai Viet two provinces of √î and L√Ω to exchange a long-term peace and marriage with king Tr·∫ßn Nh√¢n T√¥ng's daughter Huy·ªÅn Tr√¢n.Maspero, G., 2002, The Champa Kingdom, Bangkok: White Lotus Co., Ltd., In 1471 Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát annexed Champahttps://books.google.com/books?id=Jskyi00bspcC and H·ªôi An became a Vietnamese urban, also the capital of province Qu·∫£ng Nam.Fukukawa Yuichi, Ki·∫øn tr√∫c ph·ªë c·ªï H·ªôi An - Vi·ªát Nam, Chiba University, 2006 In 1535 Portuguese explorer and sea captain Ant√≥nio de Faria, coming from Da Nang, tried to establish a major trading centre at the port village of Faifo.Spencer Tucker, \\"Vietnam\\", University Press of Kentucky, 1999, , p. 22 Since 1570, Southern Vietnam had been under control of powerful Nguy·ªÖn clan, established by governor Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng. The Nguy·ªÖn lords were far more interested in commercial activity than the Tr·ªãnh lords who ruled the north. As a result, H·ªôi An flourished as a trading port and became the most important trade port on the South China sea. Captain William Adams, the English sailor and confidant of Tokugawa Ieyasu, is known to have made one trading mission to H·ªôi An in 1617 on a Red Seal Ship. The early Portuguese Jesuits also had one of their two residences at H·ªôi An.Roland Jacques Portuguese pioneers of Vietnamese linguistics prior to 1650 2002 Page 28 \\"At the time Pina wrote, early 1623, the Jesuits had two main residences, one in H·ªôi An in Qu·∫£ng Nam, the other at Quy Nh∆°n.\\" H·ªôi An was a divided town with the Japanese settlement across the \\"Japanese Bridge\\" (16th-17th century).The bridge (Ch√πa c·∫ßu) is a unique covered structure built by the Japanese merchants, the only known covered bridge with a Buddhist temple attached to one side. In the 18th century, H·ªôi An was considered by Chinese and Japanese merchants to be the best destination for trading in all of Southeast Asia, even Asia. The city also rose to prominence as a powerful and exclusive trade conduit between Europe, China, India, and Japan, especially for the ceramic industry. Shipwreck discoveries have shown that Vietnamese and Asian ceramics were transported from H·ªôi An to as far as Sinai, Egypt.Li Tana (1998). Nguyen Cochinchina p. 69. H·ªôi An port in 18th century H·ªôi An's importance waned sharply at the end of the 18th century because of the collapse of Nguy·ªÖn rule (thanks to the T√¢y S∆°n Rebellion - which was opposed to foreign trade). In 1775, H·ªôi An had been the battleground between Tr·ªãnh army and T√¢y S∆°n rebels, and the city was destroyed. Then, with the triumph of Emperor Gia Long, he repaid the French for their aid by giving them exclusive trade rights to the nearby port town of ƒê√† N·∫µng. ƒê√† N·∫µng became the new centre of trade (and later French influence) in central Vietnam while H·ªôi An was a forgotten backwater. Local historians also say that H·ªôi An lost its status as a desirable trade port due to silting up of the river mouth. The result was that H·ªôi An remained almost untouched by the changes to Vietnam over the next 200 years. The efforts to revive the city were only done by a late Polish architect and influential cultural educator, Kazimierz Kwiatkowski, who finally brought back H·ªôi An to the world. There is still a statue for the late Polish architect in the city, and remains a symbol of the relationship between Poland and Vietnam, which share many historical commons despite its distance.https://culture.pl/en/artist/kazimierz-kwiatkowski Today, the town is a tourist attraction because of its history, traditional architecture and crafts such as textiles and ceramics. Many bars, hotels, and resorts have been constructed both in H·ªôi An and the surrounding area. The port mouth and boats are still used for both fishing and tourism. Weather Hoi An has two main seasons during the year: rainy and dry seasons, with a warm average temperature of 29 ¬∞C during the year. The hottest period is from June to August when the highest temperature can reach 38 ¬∞C during day time. November to January will be the coldest months with an average temperature of 20 ¬∞C. The rainy season lasts from September to January with heavy rains which can cause floods and affect tourism. The city's dry season is between February and May when the weather becomes very mild with moderate temperature and less humid. Calm mild weather is now limited to the season of May/June - end of August when the seas are calm and wind changes direction and comes from the South. The remainder of the year the weather is intermittent between rain & cold and hot & mild. Activities such as visiting offshore C√π lao Ch√†m islands are only guaranteed to be likely during the short season of end of May to end of August, which is the high season for domestic tourism. Heritage and tourism In 1999 the old town was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as a well-preserved example of a Southeast Asian trading port of the 15th to 19th centuries, with buildings that display a blend of local and foreign influences. According to the UNESCO Impact Report 2008 on H·ªôi An, tourism has brought changes to the area which are not sustainable without mitigation. Owing to the increased number of tourists visiting Hoi An a variety of activities are emerging that allow guests to get out of the old quarter and explore by motorbike, bicycle, kayak, or motorboat. The Thu Bon River is still essential to the region more than 500 years after Ant√≥nio de Faria first navigated it and it remains an essential form of food production and transport. As such kayak and motorboat rides are becoming an increasingly common tourist activity.Hoiankayak.com This longtime trading port city offers a distinctive regional cuisine that blends centuries of cultural influences from East and Southeast Asia. Hoi An hosts a number of cooking classes where tourists can learn to make cao l·∫ßu or braised spiced pork noodle, a signature dish of the city. The Hoi An wreck, a shipwreck from the mid- to late- fifteenth century, was discovered off the coast of the city in the 1990s. A few years later, it was excavated; thousands of ceramic artefacts were discovered. Another attraction is the Hoi An Lantern Full Moon Festival taking place every full moon cycle. The celebrations honour the ancestors. People exchange flowers, lanterns, candles, and fruits for prosperity and good fortune. The Faifo Coffee house has an open air rooftop that has become a particularly popular location for Asian tourists to stop for well dressed selfies and posed photos.https://www.rustycompass.com/vietnam-travel- guide-233/hoi-an-28/eating-16/faifo-coffee-hoi-an-1460#.XglFmsAxXDs =Museums= The city has four museums highlighting the history of the region. These museums are managed by the Hoi An Center for Cultural Heritage Management and Preservation. Entrance to the museum is permitted with a Hoi An Entrance Ticket. The Museum of History and Culture, at 13 Nguyen Hue St, was originally a pagoda, built in the 17th century by Minh Huong villagers to worship the Guanyin, and is adjacent to the Guan Yu temple. It contains original relics from the Sa Huynh, Champa, Dai Viet and Dai Nam periods, tracing the history of Hoi An's inhabitants from its earliest settlers through to French colonial times. The Hoi An Folklore Museum, at 33 Nguyen Thai Hoc Street, was opened in 2005, and is the largest two-storey wooden building in the old town, at 57m long and 9m wide, with fronts at Nguyen Thai Hoc St and Bach Dang St. On the second floor, there are 490 artifacts, organised into four areas: plastic folk arts, performing folk arts, traditional occupations and artifacts related to the daily life of Hoi An residents. The Museum of Trade Ceramics is located at 80 Tran Phu Street, and was established in 1995, in a restored wooden building, originally built around 1858. The items originating from Persia, China, Thailand, India and other countries are proof of the importance of H·ªôi An as a major trading port in South East Asia. The Museum of Sa Hu·ª≥nh Culture, is located at 149 Tran Phu Street. Established in 1994, this museum displays a collection of over 200 artifacts from the Sa Hu·ª≥nh culture‚Äîconsidered to be the original settlers on the H·ªôi An site‚Äîdating to over 2000 years ago. This museum is considered to be the most unusual collection of Sa Hu·ª≥nh artefacts in Vietnam. The Precious Heritage Museum is located at 26 Phan Boi Chau. It includes a 250m2 display of photos and artifacts collected by R√©hahn during the past 5 years of the French photographer's explorations of Vietnam. Food According to CNN, Hoi An is the \\"banh mi capital of Vietnam.\\" Banh Mi is a type of Vietnamese sandwich, consisting of a French baguette, p√¢t√©, meats and fresh herbs. It is a fusion of French and Vietnamese cuisine. The regional dish is Cao l·∫ßu, consisting of rice noodles, meat, greens, bean sprouts, and herbs, most commonly served with a small amount of broth. The water for the broth has been traditionally taken from the Ba Le Well, thought to have been built in the 10th century by the Chams. Other regional specialties include mi quang noodles, banh bao banh vac, hoanh thanh, com ga (chicken with rice), b√°nh x√®o, sweet corn soup and baby clam salad are also regional specialties.

Early life Born in San Mateo, California, and professionally trained as a registered nurse, Milos started campaigning against circumcision with nurses and parents in 1979. The spark for her activism was an experience at a newborn nursery, where she had been instructed to attend a circumcision of an infant boy.Marilyn Fayre Milos, \\"Infant Circumcision: What I Wish I Had Known,\\" Truth Seeker, vol. 1, no. 3 (July‚ÄìAugust 1989), p. 3.

Opposition to circumcision Milos, who opposes non-therapeutic circumcision of children, bases part of her argument on the fact that the foreskin protects the glans from friction and abrasion throughout life.\\"Marilyn Milos and Donna Macris note that some have claimed that the foreskin provides a protective covering for the glans, making the uncircumcised penis more sensitive during sexual activity.\\" Stephen Garrard Post, ed., Encyclopedia of Bioethics, 5 vols (3rd edition; New York: MacMillan Reference, 2004), vol. 1, p. 422; see also Morris L.

A walkout can also mean the act of leaving a place of work, school, a meeting, a company, or an organization, especially if meant as an expression of protest or disapproval. A walkout can be seen as different from a strike in that a walkout can occur spontaneously, and need not necessarily involve all the workers present, whereas a strike is often voted on beforehand by the workers, giving notification both to all of the workers and to the company affected. Walkouts have often been staged against the presence of a speaker or the content of an in-progress speech at a meeting. The protest, which is often a silent, non- violent means of expressing disapproval, is often interpreted as an exercise of the freedom of association while allowing the speaker to exercise the freedom of speech, albeit with a reduced audience in attendance.  Notable walkouts  1968 East Los Angeles = These were a series of 1968 protests against unequal conditions in Los Angeles Unified School District high schools, beginning on March 6. = Women Factory Walkouts of 1834 and 1836Dublin. The Early Strikes: 1830s. Background In the beginning of the 19th century there was a change in economic circumstances with the booming Industrial Revolution and young single women, between ages of fourteen to early twenties felt the need to work to relieve financial pressures from their family and to gain a sense of independence of living on their own. They left home and began a new life in the mill boarding houses. While working in the mills they would send some monthly earnings back home to still fulfill the role as a contributing part of the family. However, the majority of their earnings was saved in the bank for their own desires. Most women who made this change came from a modest farming backgrounds and made the move to areas of New England and Mid Atlantic States. Economic Crisis of 1834 In the early months of 1834, textile sales were slow and profits were not up to standard to provide sufficient wages for the women mill workers of Lowell, Massachusetts. As a result, wages were cut and the price of room and board went up. The mill factory women saw this wage cut and price increase as an offense to their dignity, social quality, and economic autonomy. The women decided to take action and many started petitions and held meetings during dinner breaks. They pledged that they would quit if the wage rates decreased. On a Friday in February 1834, a sporadic walkout began after a meeting in which an agent of a mill company dismissed a woman factory worker. Protesting began and the women quit work and started parading through the city streets, attempting to persuade other mill women to join. This walkout was short lived and by the middle of the next week the women either returned to work or left town. Only about one-sixth of all women workers in Lowell walked out. Walkout of October 1836 In October 1836, the women workers in the Lowell, Massachusetts factory mills walked out once again for the same reasons as the strike in 1834. The young women saw the wage-cut and the increasing prices of housing board as a direct assault on their social and economic independence, and they wouldn't let the revolting wage-cut and rising prices undermined their status as \\"daughters of freemen\\". Furthermore, as influenced by their traditional values, the young women did not accept to be treated as slaves so they protested. In this second walkout however, the women workers were more organized, and the number of workers involved in the strikes were far numerous than the one sixth of all the factory workers in 1834 and this had a greater impact on the success of their operation. The other cause to their success of this second walkout was the economic prosperity of the 1840s; the mills profits were booming and they needed more workers. Therefore, the walkout of 1836 affected the mills greatly because they were short in workers, and the lengthy absence of the women accentuated the impact. As a result, some of the mills were obliged to cut their charges on housing, and they were forced to cooperate with the women workers' organization. Effects The women wanted to take a stand for their independence. With the decision making of having walkouts, they portrayed how women started a new revolution with a new idea of feminine autonomy and power. The 1834 and 1836 walkouts symbolized women standing against oppression by employers who wished to lower their wages, as well as increase the price in housing. With these walkouts women took a stand for themselves as well as paved the way for the generations of women to come.

State Route 4 (SR 4) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California, routed from Interstate 80 in the San Francisco Bay Area to State Route 89 in the Sierra Nevada. It roughly parallels the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, a popular area for boating and fishing, with a number of accesses to marinas and other attractions. After crossing the Central Valley, the highway ascends up the Sierra foothills. It passes through Ebbetts Pass and contains the Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway, a National Scenic Byway. Route description Route 4 through Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest Intersection of California State Routes 4 & 89 Interstate 680 crossing State Route 4, with Mount Diablo rising in background. September 30, 2007. Courtesy Michael Hicks. SR 4, an east-west highway, begins in Hercules at San Pablo Avenue next to the Interstate 80 junction as part of John Muir Parkway. (The actual parkway extends a bit past the western terminus.) The road is an expressway from its starting point until it approaches Martinez, at which point it becomes a full freeway (the California Delta Highway) passing Concord, Pittsburg, and Antioch. The John Muir National Historic Site is located directly north of Route 4 on Alhambra Avenue in Martinez. Alhambra Avenue at SR 4 is also the site of the Franklin Canyon Adobe. Two gauges of BART tracks run in the median of the freeway from the Port Chicago Highway interchange in Concord to just east of the Hillcrest Avenue interchange in Antioch, where the light rail line currently ends at the Antioch station. After Antioch, the freeway turns southward at its intersection with State Route 160, turning into a suburban and rural road bypassing the Bay Area's rapidly growing and outermost eastern suburbs (Oakley, Brentwood and Discovery Bay, California); and continues east across Victoria Island. This section is also known as the John Marsh Heritage Highway. Route 4 east continues to Stockton, where it briefly joins I-5 and then enters a separate freeway (known locally as the Crosstown Freeway) routing almost directly through downtown Stockton. The route then runs concurrent with State Route 99 before running eastward into the Sierra through Angels Camp, one of the richest quartz mining sections of the Mother Lode and home of \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\", and Calaveras Big Trees State Park. The route runs through the Pacific Grade Summit on its way up to the Ebbetts Pass and ends at State Route 89 ten miles (16 km) west of Topaz Lake, on the California‚ÄìNevada border. Signage indicating that SR 4 continues up to Woodfords exists in Woodfords heading westbound, including reassurance shields for both SR 89 and SR 4 on top of the mileage sign just south of town. Eastbound signage for SR 4 stops at the intersection with SR 89. The portion from Arnold to its terminus is designated the Ebbetts Pass Scenic Byway, which is eventually one lane. Through the mountains, SR 4 is not suitable for large trucks, buses, or RVs, as it becomes very steep and eventually single-track, with no center dividing line shortly after the Mount Reba Turnoff to Bear Valley Ski area, with tight switchbacks. The pass is not plowed for snow, and thus closes during the winter months, often from November through as late as May. Thus, no passage between the Mount Reba Turnoff and Markleeville is possible. The western slope is plowed and rarely closes, even for a few hours, but often has chain restrictions during and immediately following storms, usually just east of Arnold. The eastern slope is not plowed. SR 4 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and from just west of Stockton to SR 49 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 4 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System; however, it is only a scenic highway as designated by Caltrans from a point east of Arnold to SR 89, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 4 is also known as part of the John Muir Parkway from I-80 in Hercules to I-680 near Martinez, named for the environmentalist John Muir. The stretch through Franklin Canyon was once known as \\"Blood Alley\\". History Although segments of Route 4 had been part of the state highway system since 1909, Route 4 was officially designated as such between US Route 40 (now Interstate 80) and State Route 99 in 1934. Prior to that date, the then-existing segment was officially known as the \\"Borden Highway\\", and the bridge over the San Joaquin River is still referred to as the \\"Borden Highway Bridge\\" in tidal tables. Construction of Route 4 did not finish until 1935, however. The portion of Route 4 from US Route 40 to State Route 24 was added to the highway system in 1933 as Legislative Route Number (LRN) 106. East of the concurrency with State Route 24 to State Route 49, Route 4 was designated as LRN 75 from 1931-1934. Finally, the segment from State Route 49 to State Route 89 was signed as LRN 24 from 1909 to 1934. In the 1970s, a significant portion of the Filipino American community of \\"Little Manila\\" in Stockton was demolished when the \\"Crosstown Freeway\\" was constructed, displacing what was once the largest population of Filipinos outside of the Philippines. From 1998 to 2009, a road built by the State Route 4 Bypass Authority, named the State Route 4 Bypass, opened in three phases, bypassing Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the south and west. Many of the signs and local maps designated this extension as simply \\"Bypass Road\\". A section of Marsh Creek Road was widened to serve as the connection between the bypass built by the authority and the original Route 4 towards Stockton. In 2012, Caltrans handed over authority for State Route 4 in Oakley and Brentwood to the respective cities. In return, it gained control of the bypass and the upgraded section of Marsh Creek Road, which officially became State Route 4. Construction is currently underway on widening the freeway section of Route 4 through Antioch, Oakley and Brentwood, with the final configuration as three mixed use lanes and one High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane in each direction and auxiliary lanes between interchanges as far as the interchange with Route 160. The median accommodates the eBART extension of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. All work at the Loveridge Road and Somersville Road/Auto Center Drive interchanges has been completed; however, the HOV lane east of the Loveridge Road overpass remains closed pending completion of construction at the L Street/Contra Loma Boulevard and A Street/Lone Tree Way interchanges. Speed on the freeway through the Antioch portion of Route 4 is limited to 55 miles per hour (90 km/h), as there is severe congestion, as well as areas where no shoulder exists due to temporary concrete barriers in place. Only the portion of the bypass from California SR 160 to the Balfour Road interchange is a multi-lane freeway. The portion from Balfour Road to Vasco Road is single-lane each way and has a signal-controlled grade crossing at Marsh Creek Road. In May 2010, this narrow stretch of the road handled 27,000 to 30,000 vehicles per day. In 2011, Caltrans awarded $25 million toward upgrading the section from Lone Tree Way to Sand Creek Road to a full freeway and constructing an interchange at Sand Creek Road. Soon after the Sand Creek Interchange was opened in Brentwood in 2015, construction began on widening SR 4 to Balfour Road, the next major interchange planned for Brentwood. In 2017, work commenced on the Balfour Interchange, which provided a 2-lane overpass for SR 4 and widened it a short distance beyond the Balfour exit.http://hannagrp.com/website/ccta-sr4-balfour-road-interchange/ \\"CCTA ‚Äì SR4 / Balfour Road Interchange.\\" June 17, 2014.] Accessed July 29, 2017 Effective in early March 2016, reconfiguration of the intersection of SR 4 and SR 160 was officially opened, allowing westbound SR 4 traffic to access northbound SR 160 directly and southbound SR 160 to access eastbound SR 4.Szymanski, Kyle. \\"East County connector ramps open.\\" Brentwood Press.

Under one proposal, the new interstate would go along SR 99 from the split with I-5 at Wheeler Ridge north through Fresno to Stockton, where the proposed route would then turn west via the SR 4 freeway to a terminus at I-5. In 2016, Pittsburg moved to install surveillance cameras along their portion of the route, in response to a series of 20 freeway shootings in the area that had taken the lives of six people, and injured 11, in the past year.

SR-4/I-680 interchange improvements On February 1, 2019, the Brentwood Press newspaper reported that officials representing the Contra Costa Transportation Authority (CCTA) and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) had held a groundbreaking ceremony to start a project that is intended to reduce congestion at the SR 4/I-680 interchange just outside Martinez. The multiphase project will widen SR 4 by adding a third lane in each direction, beginning at Morello Avenue in Martinez and ending at the merge of SR 4 and SR 242. It will also include replacing the 50-year-old Grayson Creek Bridge, which has outlived its serviceable life and does not meet current bridge safety codes. The project will impact about of SR 4.

His early education was limited, though his talent for mathematics was discovered, and to some extent developed, by a teacher in his native town. He left Ireland in his youth, arriving in Philadelphia on 10 October 1817. Here he worked for two years as a bookkeeper and then taught mathematics at Frederick, Maryland. In 1826 he became a student at the old seminary in Washington, DC, intending to prepare himself for the Catholic priesthood, and at the same time taught one of its classes. The seminary, however, which had been established in 1820, was closed in the following year and he joined the Society of Jesus on 29 September 1827. After completing his novitiate he again taught in Frederick and was sent in 1831 to teach natural philosophy at Georgetown University. He also studied theology and was ordained priest on 1 June 1833. His first Mass was said at the Georgetown Visitation Monastery, Georgetown, where he afterwards acted as chaplain for fifty years. He spent the remainder of his life at Georgetown, where he taught natural philosophy and mathematics for forty-eight years. He planned and superintended the building of the Georgetown Observatory in 1844 and was its first director, filling this position for many years. One of his earliest achievements was the determination of the latitude and longitude of Washington, D.C. in 1846. His results did not agree with those obtained at the Naval Observatory, and it was not until after the laying of the first transatlantic cable in 1858 that his determination was found to be near the truth. Father Curley was also much interested in botany. He is best remembered, however, as a teacher. He wrote Annals of the Observatory of Georgetown College, D.C., containing the description of the observatory and the description and use of the transit instrument and meridian circle (New York, 1852).Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Georgetown College, D.C.

Photo by Malene Thyssen, A view of Himmelbjerget near the town of Ry seen over Juuls√∏ (2005). Photo by Lars Helbo. Until January 1, 2007 Ry municipality was a municipality (Danish, kommune) in the former Aarhus County on the Jutland peninsula in central Denmark. The municipality covered an area of 152,44 km2, and had a total population of 11.244 (2005). Its last mayor was Jonna Gr√∏nver, a member of the Venstre (Liberal Party) political party. The main town and the site of its municipal council was the town of Ry. The municipality was created in 1970 as the result of a (\\"Municipality Reform\\") that merged a number of existing parishes: * Alling Parish * Dover Parish * Gammel Rye Parish * L√•sby Parish * RyParish * Tulstrup Parish Ry municipality ceased to exist as the result of Kommunalreformen (\\"The Municipality Reform\\" of 2007). It was merged with Galten, H√∏rning, and Skanderborg municipalities to form the new Skanderborg municipality. This created a municipality with an area of 416 km2 and a total population of 49,469 (2005). The towns of the former municipality Ry, also known as Ry Station, is located between the lakes of Gudens√∏, Juuls√∏ and Knuds√∏ along the Guden River (Guden√•). It is a relatively new town that developed around the railroad tracks. The original town in the area is now known as Old Rye (Gammel Rye). Old Rye is located 3 km west of Rye. During the Middle Ages it was one of the most important towns in the area. It had the royal status and privileges of being a merchant town, and is thus named in 1536. Starting in the 15th century until 1687, Old Rye was an area Court of Justice. The town had a major impact on Danish history in 1534, when King Christian III was chosen there. Denmark was attacked by L√ºbeck when Frederik I died in 1533. This led to the three-year civil war fought between 1534-1536 called The Count's Feud (Grevens fejde), which ushered in the Danish Reformation. The town's location at the crossroads for traffic between East Jutland and West Jutland, along with the royal glass production facility in nearby Glarbo until ca. 1600, have helped secure the town's position in the years after the Reformation. There is mention in 1553 of a royal coach maker in the area, and there used to be a royal hunting lodge in the area, but it was torn down in 1617. The town has suffered fire several times, f. ex. 1613, 1618 and 1660. St. S√∏ren's Church in Old Rye is at the site of a holy spring, and has had the reputation for bringing about miracles. In the Middle Ages many pilgrimages were made here. It is here that King Christian III was chosen in 1534. From 1579 a market was held on the site on the saint's day. According to legend, St. S√∏ren was a local farmer who became a bishop in Cologne. In the 19th century Old Rye became a center for the production of wooden shoes, and today there is a Wooden Shoe Museum located at the site of a historic windmill (1872) in the town. With the establishment of the railroad from Skanderborg to Silkeborg in 1871, the area's growth, however, became centered on the station town Ry. L√•sby can trace its origin to Viking times. Hjejlen (\\"The Golden Plover\\") is a historic steamboat that sails from Silkeborg to Himmelbjerget. Other attractions Himmelbjerget (affectionately translated as \\"Heaven Mountain\\"), located in the former municipality, is one of the highest points of elevation in Denmark at 147 meters. The high hill is a popular destination for its beautiful nature and magnificent views. One can sail to Himmelbjerget from Ry, or from Silkeborg on the historic steamship Hjejlen (\\"The Golden Plover\\"). On top of the hill is a 25 meter tall tower that was erected to honor King Frederik VII and his role in giving the Danish people a constitution in 1849. Close to the top are more monuments, most honoring individuals, but also one to commemorate women's right to vote in 1915. The Hotel Himmelbjerget, formerly Hotel Juls√∏, is the highest located hotel in Denmark, and displays historic memorabilia from the area. It used to house a museum dedicated to Jodle Birge, Danish country-western entertainer. To the east of Old Rye is a ca. 23 hectares conservation area of heather-covered hills and oak scrub. There is also Gallows Hill, the site of beheadings during the times when Court was held in Ry. Nearby Moss√∏ is Denmark's second largest lake.

It is headquartered in California, with centers in other US states and countries. In 2016, the organization changed its name from NOCIRC to Genital Autonomy America. Its goal is to secure \\"the birthright of male, female, and intersex children and babies to keep their sex organs intact.\\"  Origins  The organization was founded in 1985 by registered nurse Marilyn Milos, who remains the director today. The organization was the first national clearinghouse in the US for information about circumcision. In its first decade, NOCIRC grew into an international network and now has over 110 centers worldwide, including at least 17 outside of the US. It is a member of the International Coalition for Genital Integrity (ICGI).  Position  NOCIRC opposes the non-therapeutic circumcision of children. The organization suggests that circumcision be performed only when it is absolutely medically necessary and after alternative non-invasive therapies have failed, or when an adult gives consent, after he has been fully informed about the risks and harm of the procedure. NOCIRC also provides material on their view of circumcision and care of the foreskin. NOCIRC states that their position is based on the understanding that there is not a national or international health association in the world that recommends routine infant circumcision, yet declare that they hold the medical community accountable for \\"misconstruing the scientific database available on human circumcision in the world today\\". In a 1996 press release, NOCIRC stated that \\"We expect this professional organization [the American Academy of Pediatrics] that is concerned with the health of infants and children to reveal the harm of genital cutting and to protect every child's birthright to keep his or her sex organs intact.\\" The American Academy of Pediatrics said in 1999 that the perceived benefits of circumcision are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision, but that it should be the decision of informed parents.  Publications  NOCIRC publishes a number of brochures for parents, providing their recommendations about infant circumcisions, penile care and several related topics. NOCIRC also distributes an annual newsletter to its members. Most of the organization's material is directly available on their website.  International symposia  Since 1989, NOCIRC has sponsored and organized international symposia on circumcision, human rights, and genital integrity.

Etymology Ailuranthropy comes from the Greek words ailouros meaning \\"cat\\", and anthropos, meaning \\"human\\" and refers to human/feline transformations, or to other beings that combine feline and human characteristics. Its root word is also used in ailurophobia, the most common term for a phobia of cats. Ailuranthrope is a lesser-known term that refers to a feline therianthrope. Depending on the story in question, the species involved can be a domestic cat, a tiger, a lion, a leopard, a lynx, or any other type, including some that are purely mythical felines. FolkloreEurope= European folklore usually depicts werecats as people who transform into domestic cats. Some European werecats became giant domestic cats or panthers. They are generally labelled witches, even though they may have no magical ability other than self-transformation. During the witch trials, all shapeshifters, including werewolves, were considered witches whether they were male or female. =Africa= African legends describe werelions, werepanthers or wereleopards. In the case of leopards, this is often because the creature is really a leopard deity masquerading as a human. When these gods mate with humans, offspring can be produced, and these children sometimes grow up to be shapeshifters; those who don't transform may instead have other powers. In reference to werecats who turn into lions, the ability is often associated with royalty. Such a being may have been a king or queen in a former life. In Africa, there are folk tales that speak of the \\"Nunda,\\" or the \\"Mngwa,\\" a big cat of immense size that stalks villages at night. Many of these tales say it is more ferocious than a Lion and more agile than a Leopard. The Nunda are believed by some to be a variation of therianthrope that, by day, is a human, but by night becomes the werecat. No actual evidence of such a creature existing has ever been documented, but in 1938 a British Explorer named William Hichens, working in Tanzania, was told by locals that a monstrous cat had been attacking people at night. Huge paw prints were found to be much larger than any known big-cat, but Hichens dismissed the case, believing it more likely to be a lion with gigantism. =Asia= Mainland Asian werecats usually become tigers. In India, the weretiger is often a dangerous sorcerer, portrayed as a menace to livestock, who might at any time turn to man-eating. These tales travelled through the rest of India and into Persia through travellers who encountered the royal Bengal tigers of India and then further west.lycanthropy ‚Äì the were- tiger of the east indies Chinese legends often describe weretigers as the victims of either a hereditary curse or a vindictive ghost. Ancient teachings held that every race except the Han Chinese were really animals in disguise, so that there was nothing extraordinary about some of these false humans reverting to their true natures. Alternatively, the ghosts of people who had been killed by tigers could become a malevolent supernatural being known as \\"Chang\\" (‰º•), devoting all their energy to making sure that tigers killed more humans. Some of these ghosts were responsible for transforming ordinary humans into man-eating weretigers. Also, in Japanese folklore there are creatures called bakeneko that are similar to kitsune (fox spirits) and bake-danuki (Japanese raccoon dog spirits). In Thailand a tiger that eats many humans may become a weretiger. There are also other types of weretigers, such as sorcerers with great powers who can change their form to become animals. In both Indonesia and Malaysia there is another kind of weretiger, known as Harimau jadian. In Malaysia, Bajangs have been described as vampiric or demonic werecats. In the central area of the Indonesian island of Java the power of transformation is regarded as due to inheritance, to the use of spells, to fasting and willpower, to the use of charms, etc. Save when it is hungry or has just cause for revenge it is not hostile to man; in fact, it is said to take its animal form only at night and to guard the plantations from wild pigs. Variants of this belief assert that the shapeshifter does not recognize his friends unless they call him by name, or that he goes out as a mendicant and transforms himself to take vengeance on those who refuse him alms. Somewhat similar is the belief of the Khonds; for them the tiger is friendly, and he reserves his wrath for their enemies. A man is said to take the form of a tiger in order to wreak a just vengeance. =The Americas= The foremost were-animal in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures was the were- jaguar. It was associated with the veneration of the jaguar, with priests and shamans among the various peoples who followed this tradition wearing the skins of jaguars to \\"become\\" a were-jaguar. Among the Aztecs, an entire class of specialized warriors who dressed in the jaguar skins were called \\"jaguar warriors\\" or \\"jaguar knights\\". Depictions of the jaguar and the were-jaguar are among the most common motifs among the artifacts of the ancient Mesoamerican civilizations. N.W. Thomas wrote in the 11th ed. of the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) that according to Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794‚Äì1868), the kanaima was a human being who employed poison to carry out his function of blood avenger, and that other authorities represent the kanaima as a jaguar, which was either an avenger of blood or the familiar of a cannibalistic sorcerer. He also mentioned that in 1911 some Europeans in Brazil believed that the seventh child of the same sex in unbroken succession becomes a were-man or woman, and takes the form of a horse, goat, jaguar or pig. In the US, urban legends tell of encounters with feline bipeds; beings similar to the Bigfoot having cat heads, tails, and paws. Feline bipeds are sometimes classified as part of cryptozoology, but more often they are interpreted as werecats. Occultism and theology Assertions that werecats truly exist and have an origin in supernatural or religious realities have been common for centuries, with these beliefs often being hard to entirely separate from folklore. In the 19th century, occultist J. C. Street asserted that material cat and dog transformations could be produced by manipulating the \\"ethereal fluid\\" that human bodies are supposedly floating in. The Catholic witch-hunting manual, the Malleus Maleficarum, asserted that witches can turn into cats, but that their transformations are illusions created by demons. New Age author John Perkins asserted that every person has the ability to shapeshift into \\"jaguars, bushes, or any other form\\" by using mental power. Occultist Rosalyn Greene claims that werecats called \\"cat shifters\\" exist as part of a \\"shifter subculture\\" or underground New Age religion based on lycanthropy and related beliefs. In popular culture Werecats are increasingly featured in popular culture, although not as often as werewolves. By far the most prevalent occurrence of werecats in pop culture is in books. Some novels, novellas, and short stories with werecats are listed below. * In the Harry Potter series, Professor McGonagall can transform into a house cat at will (known in-universe as Animagus transformation). * Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle series includes several characters who are werecats. * The children's novel, Sebastian Darke: Prince of Pirates, features an enchantress named Leonora, who can turn herself into a panther at will. She is recognisable in this form by the tawny colour of her pelt, which matches her eyes when she is in human form. * The protagonist of Rachel Vincent's Shifters series is a werecat; she is a member of a Pride led by her father. * Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series of novels has several characters who are werecats of varying types. * In Ayshen Irfan's The Fire Within My Heart, book one in the Scarlet Cherie: Vampire Series, Kai Hunter is a werecat. * In the Revelation Series (books 2, 3, 4, and 5) the character Fiona is a housekeeper and maternal figure to our clan of gargoyles. She is the alpha of her Pishankyin Clowder and transforms into a panther at will and has the ability to read any female's mind. Her daughter also makes an appearance in the last novel. * The short story \\"Lusus Naturae\\" by Margaret Atwood centers on a young woman whose parents fake her death to hide the fact that she is a werecat. Werecats also serve as heroes and villains in film and television shows. Notable examples include: * The 1942 Val Lewton film Cat People and its 1982 remake both feature female shape-changers: first Simone Simon and then Nastassja Kinski in a highly sexual role. The 1982 version also includes Malcolm McDowell as her brother, also a shape-changer. * The titular creatures in the horror film Sleepwalkers (written by Stephen King) are werecats who have psychic abilities and can hide disguised within human society. They are also energy vampires who must feed on the life-force of virgin women to survive. Their weakness is domestic cats, which can see through their illusions and destroy them via scratching. * \\"Cat creatures\\" have appeared multiple times in the Scooby-Doo franchise, including The Scooby-Doo Show (1976‚Äì1978) and What's New, Scooby Doo? (2002‚Äì2005); in the 1998 animated film Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island, the film's main antagonists are werecats. * In the mid-1980s show She-Ra: Princess of Power, the villainess Catra can change into a panther. *In the Hotel Transylvania: The Series episode \\"Buggin' Out\\", werecats roomed next to the werewolf kids. * In the 1992 Indian movie Junoon the main antagonist is afflicted by a curse that transforms him into a Bengal tiger in the presence of a full moon. * In the Tom and Jerry Tales episode \\"Monster Con\\", Tom is turned into a werecat when he looked at the full moon after being bitten by Jerry's friend, the werewolf. * In the third and fourth seasons of True Blood werepanthers are introduced. The only werepanthers seen are an impoverished and extended family called the Norrises. Werepanthers are an endangered species, and thus the Norrises have resorted to inbreeding in order to keep from going extinct. However, this tactic has essentially backfired on them; because of the lack of genetic diversity among them, the family is ravaged by feeble-mindedness and congenital illnesses which result in sterility and high infant mortality. It is unknown if the Norrises are the last of their kind. * In the fourth season of Teen Wolf, Kate Argent, played by Jill Wagner, who had presumably been killed by Peter Hale, returned as a were-jaguar. * Mattel's Monster High franchise includes five werecat characters: Toralei, Purrsephone, Meowlody, Catrine DeMew, and Catty Noir. They each appear the television specials and movies. Comic books, manga, and anime are other venues for werecats. *In Chie Shinohara's 1984 manga series Yami no Paapuru, the main character, Rinko, is pursued by the scientist, Sonehara, in order to expose to the world that Rinko is a human that can become a panther at will. * In the second book of the Elseworlds Batman vampire trilogy, Selina Kyle is attacked by a werewolf, which later causes her to literally become a catwoman when she transforms into a purple werecat. *Schr√∂dinger from the anime Hellsing is a werecat. * Marvel Comics has Catseye of the Hellions, a female teenage mutant werecat, who appears in a number of the Marvel Universe lines. *In Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose, the supporting character Boo Cat is a werecat. * The Bungo Stray Dogs series features character by the name of Nakajima Atsushi who has the ability to transform into a white tiger and sometimes even switch certain body parts to resemble a tiger's. Werecats have been featured in a number of games, both video and table-top. * The 1988 video game Altered Beast includes a stage where power-ups transform the player into a weretiger, which provides extra strength and firepower. * In the tabletop role-playing game Bastet (White Wolf Publishing, 1997), players get to play werecats. * Weretigers are also featured in Dungeons & Dragons. * In the World of Warcraft online roleplaying game, druids can transform into panther or lion-like forms, depending on their chosen race. * In the video game Breath of Fire III, one of the main characters, Rei, is a weretiger. * The 1993 Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen game features weretigers as hidden characters who can be recruited. * In the video game Bayonetta, the main character has the ability to transform into a black panther, and the witch Jeanne can transform into a red lynx. * The Darkstalkers game series features Felicia, a character who can shift between a domestic cat form and a werecat girl whenever she wants. * In the game Shifters The main character, Alleron, can shapeshift into a variety of different were creatures such as a werebull, wereeagle and the like. He also has a female werejaguar shaman form called a spirit claw who has a petite and lithe physique and is clad in only a green shawl wrapped around her body. She uses mainly magic. * In the game Perfect World International one of the playable classes is a Venomancer who may take on the guise of a werecat, werefox, werebat, werebunny and weredeer. * The Fire Emblem games, namely Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn, feature a race of people called the Laguz that can transform into various animals. One particular tribe of these Laguz can turn into beasts such as wildcats, lions and tigers. See alsoFootnotesReferences * Borges, Jorge. (1969). The book of imaginary beings. New York: E. P.

The brain's sleep-promoting nuclei (e.g., the VLPO, parafacial zone, nucleus accumbens core, and lateral hypothalamic MCH neurons), together with the ascending arousal system which includes components in the brainstem, hypothalamus and basal forebrain, are the interconnected neural systems which control states of arousal, sleep, and transitions between these two states. The VLPO is active during sleep, particularly during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep), and releases inhibitory neurotransmitters, mainly GABA and galanin, which inhibit neurons of the ascending arousal system that are involved in wakefulness and arousal. The VLPO is in turn innervated by neurons from several components of the ascending arousal system. The VLPO is activated by the endogenous sleep- promoting substances adenosine and prostaglandin D2. The VLPO is inhibited during wakefulness by the arousal-inducing neurotransmitters norepinephrine and acetylcholine. The role of the VLPO in sleep and wakefulness, and its association with sleep disorders ‚Äì particularly insomnia and narcolepsy ‚Äì is a growing area of neuroscience research. Structure At least 80% of neurons in the VLPO that project to the ascending arousal system are GABAergic (neurons that produce GABA). In vitro studies in rats have shown that many neurons in the VLPO that are inhibited by norepinephrine or acetylcholine are multipolar triangular shaped cells with low threshold spikes. These triangular multipolar neurons exist in two sub-populations in the VLPO: *Type 1 ‚Äì inhibited by serotonin. *Type 2 ‚Äì excited by serotonin and adenosine. As adenosine accumulates during wakefulness it is likely that type 2 cells play a role in sleep induction. The remaining third of neurons in the VLPO are excited by norepinephrine. Their role is unclear. FunctionSleep/wakefulness= Schematic representation of the Flip-Flop Switch Hypothesis In the early 20th century, Constantin von Economo noted that humans who had encephalitis with lesions in the anterior hypothalamus had insomnia, and proposed a sleep-promoting influence from that area. Animal studies in the mid-20th century in rats and cats confirmed that very large lesions in the preoptic area and basal forebrain resulted in insomnia but did not identify the cell group that was responsible. In 1996, Sherin and colleagues reported the presence of a cell group in the VLPO that expresses cFos (a protein often found in neurons that have recently been active) during sleep, and that these neurons contain the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and galanin. . These same neurons were found to innervate components of the ascending arousal system, including the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) and other components of the lateral hypothalamus; the raphe nuclei; the locus coeruleus (LC); the pedunculopontine (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (LDT); and the parabrachial nucleus (PB). More recent studies using opto- or chemogenetic activation of VLPO neurons have confirmed that they promote sleep. The sleep- promoting effects of the VLPO neurons is thought to be due to release of GABA and possibly galanin that suppresses firing of arousal system neurons. As the VLPO is also inhibited by neurotransmitters released by components of the arousal systems, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, a current theory has proposed that the VLPO and the arousal system form a \\"flip-flop\\" circuit. This term from electrical engineering denotes a circuit in which mutual inhibition means that each component of the circuit, as it turns on, turns the other off, resulting in rapid transitions from one state (wake or sleep) to the other, with minimal time in transition states. This theory has been used to create mathematical models that explain much of the wake-sleep behavior in animals, including in pathological states and responses to drugs. Orexin neurons in the posterior lateral hypothalamus potentiate neurons in the ascending arousal system and help stabilize the brain in the waking state (and consolidated wakefulness, which builds up homeostatic sleep drive, helps stabilize the brain during later sleep). The loss of orexin neurons in the disorder narcolepsy destabilizes the wake-sleep switch, resulting in overwhelming sleep episodes during the waking day, as well as more frequent awakenings from sleep at night. =Circadian rhythm= There is a strong circadian rhythm of sleep in mammals. The ‚Äúmaster clock‚Äù for circadian rhythms in mammals is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN has little if any projection directly to the VLPO neurons. Instead, they project strongly to the adjacent subparaventricular zone, which in turn contains inhibitory GABAergic neurons that innervate the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus. Lesions of the dorsomedial nucleus almost completely eliminate the circadian rhythm of sleep. GABAergic neurons in the dorsomedial nucleus innervate the VLPO, and glutamatergic neurons innervate the lateral hypothalamus, suggesting that the dorsomedial nucleus mainly promotes wakefulness during the active period (daytime for humans). Clinical significanceInsomnia= Elderly human patients with more galanin neurons in their intermediate nucleus (the human equivalent of the VLPO galanin neurons in rodents) have better, more continuous sleep. A reduced number of VLPO neurons is associated with more fragmented sleep (more awakenings throughout the night). Lesions in the VLPO in rats results in 50-60% decrease in NREM sleep time and prolonged insomnia. More recent research suggests that stress-induced insomnia could be due to an imbalance of input to arousal system and VLPO neurons. =Sedative/hypnotic drugs= Many sedative/hypnotic drugs act by binding to and potentiating GABA-A receptors. These include older drugs such as ethanol, chloral hydrate and barbiturates, as well as newer benzodiazepines and \\"non-benzodiazepine\\" drugs (such as zolpidem, which bind to the same receptor but have a different chemical configuration), and even anesthetics such as propofol and isoflurane. As the VLPO inputs to the arousal system use this same receptor, these drugs at low doses essentially act by potentiating the VLPO, producing a sleepy state. Animal studies show that VLPO neurons show cFos activation after sedative doses of these drugs, and that VLPO lesions produce resistance to their sedative effects. However, at high doses that produce a surgical plane of anesthesia, these drugs have much more widespread inhibitory effects, that do not depend upon the VLPO. Studies have shown that multiple sedative/hypnotic drugs that act by potentiating GABA-A receptors, including ethanol, chloral hydrate, propofol and gas anesthetics such as isoflurane, at sedative doses increase the activity of the VLPO neurons in mice. This finding suggests that at relatively low sedative doses, these medications may have a common mechanism of action, which includes potentiating the firing of VLPO neurons. High doses used in surgical anesthesia, however, reduce activity of neurons throughout the nervous system.

He remained an unrepentant supporter of Nazism after the war and the pro-fascist views he allegedly expressed in his university lectures in the 1960s sparked major student demonstrations in Vienna that resulted in at least one fatality. Life Taras Borodajkewycz was born to Wladimir Borodajkewycz, Galician Ukrainian railway employee, and his wife Henriette (n√©e L√∂we). During the interwar years, he was an adherent of Catholic-national ideas which attempted to combine Catholic identity and pan-German politics. In 1933, Borodajkewycz managed to become the President of the Austrian Katholikentag (Catholics Day). The event was an important gathering of the clerical regime of Engelbert Dollfuss and Austrofascism. Dollfuss was murdered by the Nazis in July 1934; but Borodajkewycz already in January 1934 became an illegal Austrian Nazi and member of the NSDAP. Benz, Wolfgang, ed. Handbuch des Antisemitismus: Judenfeindschaft in Geschichte und Gegenwart. Vol. 2. de Gruyter, 2009; http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-46272173.html His party number was 6,124,741.Amerongen, Martin van (1967), Eins zwei drrrei... rechts! Op mars naar het Vierde Rijk?, Baarn: Het Wereldvenster, p. 86. He was also a member of K.A.V. Norica Wien, a Catholic Studentenverbindung that was member of the Cartellverband der katholischen deutschen Studentenverbindungen, from which he was expelled in 1945 because of his support of and membership in the NSDAP. Borodajkewycz received his doctorate in history from the University of Vienna in 1932 and worked as an assistant to the right-wing scholar Heinrich von Srbik, leading up to his habilitation in 1937 in religious and intellectual history. After a short period teaching at the University of Vienna and working as an archivist in the Viennese Haus-, Hof- und Staatsarchiv, Borodajkewycz received appointment to a professorship of modern history at the German university in Prague, where he taught from 1943 to 1945.See the summary of Borodajkewycz's career in Manfred Stoy, Das √ñsterreichische Institut f√ºr Geschichtsforschung, 1929-1945 MI√ñG Erg.-Bd. 50 (Vienna/Munich, 2007), 316-17. Borodajkewycz moved back to Austria after World War II and, despite his longstanding association with the NSDAP, was rapidly rehabilitated thanks to favorable political connections in the new Austrian government. He soon resumed his teaching career at the Vienna College of World Trade (Hochschule f√ºr Welthandel), the country's leading finance and business management school. However, his continued sympathies with National Socialism were apparent. He repeatedly made neo-Nazi and antisemitic remarks in his lectures that attracted a devoted following of students who shared his conservative, anti- leftist political leanings. But Borodajkewycz's unreconstructed views, once widely publicized, unleashed a legal battle and a series of social protests that exposed tensions over how post-war Austrian society was dealing with its Nazi past.  Espionage activities for Nazi Germany  By 1939, the Sicherheitsdienst the intelligence agency of the SS used Borodajkewycz‚Äôs still existing excellent Catholic connections to entrust him with intelligence operations against the Vatican. Alvarez, David, A. Revd Robert, and S. J. Graham. Nothing sacred: Nazi espionage against the Vatican, 1939-1945. Routledge, 2013. His first task was to assess the chances of who will succeed Pope Pius XI. The Alvarez/Graham study mentions that Borodajkewycz already was an SD-informer at that time and that he volunteered to go to Rome to carry out this task. Throughout the war years, Borodajkewycz continued to be an SD spy against the Vatican.  Espionage activities for the Soviet Union  Hints as to the fact that Borodajkewycz offered his espionage activities to the Soviets after 1945 were already voiced by the former Austrian State President Heinz Fischer in his famous book on Borodajkewycz. Fischer, Heinz, ed. Einer im Vordergrund: Taras Borodajkewycz. Europa Verlag, 1966. Fischer maintains that the GRU officer who contracted Borodajkewycz was the then Vienna Station Chief Resident, Colonel Stern. Later studies could show that the involvement of Borodajkewycz with the Soviets was much deeper and that Soviet intelligence agencies provided him with generous funding for his numerous business activities, especially in Western Austria, which at that time ‚Äì until 1955 - was under Western Allied control. Breitman, Richard. US Intelligence and the Nazis. Cambridge University Press, 2005.  Activities as a senior book editor  Borodajkewycz, after 1945, worked as senior book editor for the Salzburg- based book publishing company Otto Mueller Verlag. His major success was the publishing of the book by the Austrian art historian Hans Sedlmayr \\"Verlust der Mitte\\". Rathkolb, Oliver. The Paradoxical Republic: Austria 1945 - 2005. Berghahn Books; Sedlmayr, Hans. Art in Crisis. The Lost Center. Transaction Books, New Brunswick. The Sedlmayr book, published in 1948, was a bestseller. According to Rathkolb, Borodajkewycz received royalties to the tune of 58000 ‚Ç¨. Rathkolb emphasized that the cooperation with Hans Sedlmayr dated back to the 1930s. The 1962 scandal In 1962, Heinz Fischer, future President of Austria, attacked Borodajkewycz in a journal article over remarks made during a lecture, which he reported based on a fellow-student's class notes. Since he did not want to identify the student (Ferdinand Lacina, later Austrian minister of finance, who had not graduated yet and might not have been able to do so had he been revealed), Fischer was successfully sued by Borodajkewycz for defamation, and had to pay a fine. Borodajkewycz felt encouraged by the verdict and disclosed his views more openly in his lectures from that time onwards. The 1965 scandal In March 1965, student groups, former resistance members, and unions organized a demonstration to call for Borodajkewycz's removal. The demonstration clashed with a countermarch organized by the Ring Freiheitlicher Studenten, the student organization of the Freedom Party of Austria. Ernst Kirchweger, a former resistance member and concentration camp survivor, who was watching the demonstrations but not participating himself, was seriously injured by a right-wing demonstrator. He died some days after the demonstration, becoming the first political death of the Second Republic. In April 1965, the defamation trial against Fischer was reopened, and he was acquitted on the basis of a testimony by Lacina, who had graduated in the meantime. An appeal by Borodajkewicz was rejected. Another lawsuit attempted to implicate Borodajkewicz in Kirchweger's death, but he was exonerated. Ultimately, Borodajkewycz was forced to take early retirement (with full salary), despite strong efforts by the minister of education, Theodor Piffl- Percevic, to defend him. During the following years, he continued to publish articles in right-wing journals.

It leads from Hyde Park Corner to Serpentine Road. During the 18th and 19th centuries, Rotten Row was a fashionable place for upper-class Londoners to be seen horse riding. Today it is maintained as a place to ride horses in the centre of London, but it is little used as such. History An 1833 map of Hyde Park. Rotten Row is marked as The King's Private Road Rotten Row and the South Carriage Drive c.1890-1900, photomechanical print Rotten Row was established by William III at the end of the 17th century. Having moved court to Kensington Palace, William wanted a safer way to travel to St. James's Palace. He created the broad avenue through Hyde Park, lit with 300 oil lamps in 1690‚Äì the first artificially lit highway in Britain. The lighting was a precaution against highwaymen, who lurked in Hyde Park at the time. The track was called Route du Roi, French for King's Road, which was eventually corrupted into \\"Rotten Row\\". In the 18th century, Rotten Row became a popular meeting place for upper-class Londoners. Particularly on weekend evenings and at midday, people dressed in their finest clothes to ride along the row and be seen. The adjacent South Carriage Drive was used by society people in carriages for the same purpose. In 1876, it was reconstructed as a horse-ride, with a brick base covered by sand. The sand-covered avenue of Rotten Row is maintained as a bridleway and forms part of Hyde Park's South Ride. It is convenient for the Household Cavalry, stabled nearby at Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge, to exercise their horses. Members of the public may also ride, although few people have stables close enough to make use of it. Commercial stables nearby, the Hyde Park Stables and 'Ross Nye Stables, offer horse hire and riding lessons to the public. A Royal plaque commemorating 300 years of Rotten Row was erected in 1990.

The picture was made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Delmer Daves and produced by Frank Ross. The screenplay was written by Philip Dunne based on characters created by Lloyd C. Douglas in The Robe. The movie presents Victor Mature as Demetrius, a Christian slave made to fight in the Roman arena as a gladiator, and Susan Hayward as Messalina, a reprobate who is the wife of Claudius, the uncle of the depraved emperor Caligula. The cast also features Ernest Borgnine, William Marshall, Michael Rennie, Jay Robinson as Caligula, Debra Paget, Anne Bancroft in one of her earlier roles, and Julie Newmar as a briefly seen dancing entertainer. The film is in Technicolor and CinemaScope. Plot summary The film begins with a clip from the previous film, showing its central characters Marcellus and Diana going to be martyred for their Christian beliefs on the order of Emperor Caligula. Before being executed, Diana hands the Robe of Christ to Marcellus' servant Marcipor (David Leonard), telling him that it is \\"for the Big Fisherman\\", meaning Peter, who was a fisherman before being called as an apostle. Peter (Michael Rennie) hands the Robe to Demetrius while at the funeral of Marcellus and Diana before leaving on a journey to live in 'the north'. Caligula (Jay Robinson) becomes interested in the Robe, thinking that it has magic powers and will bring him the 'eternal life' that Jesus had spoken of. He accosts his uncle Claudius (Barry Jones), wanting to know what had happened to it. Demetrius, looking out for his Lucia (Debra Paget) and the Robe and refusing to reveal its location, is arrested for assaulting a Roman soldier and sentenced to the arena. Demetrius fights and saves his opponent. The tigers are then set on him, but he kills them. Caligula then assigns him to be Messalina's bodyguard. Later, Messalina is accused of wanting Caligula dead and plotting his murder, but manipulates her way out of the situation. Meanwhile, Lucia disguises herself to gain entrance to the gladiator school to see Demetrius. However, the two are forcibly separated on orders of Messalina (Susan Hayward), Claudius' wife. Lucia is then assaulted by Dardanius (Richard Egan) and the other gladiators, forcibly kissing her and trying to carry her to private chambers. Demetrius in desperation prays for God to save her, and suddenly it appears that Dardanius has broken Lucia's neck. All present are shocked at Lucia's apparent death, especially Demetrius, and he loses all his faith in Jesus Christ as God. Previously, he had avoided killing anyone in the Emperor's games because of his religion, but all that now changes. His next time in the arena, not only does he fight, but he ferociously kills all the gladiators that took part in the attack on Lucia. The Roman spectators, including the Emperor, are thrilled. Demetrius is freed, and allowed to join the Praetorian Guard. Caligula asks if Demetrius renounces Christ; he does, and once Demetrius does this, Caligula frees him and inducts him into the guard with the rank of Tribune. As a Roman tribune, Demetrius rejects the teachings of Christ (and of Isis when encountering Messalina praying to her statue), beginning an affair with Messalina. When Peter comes to visit them, he turns him away too. The affair continues for several months. Eventually Caligula finds out about their affair, and sends Demetrius to get the Robe from the Christians. Demetrius is taken to a small house, where he is surprised to find Lucia, lying on a bed clutching the Robe. He finds out that she never had died, after all, but that when he prayed for God to save her, her sudden coma had accomplished her rescue. Now, months later, she is still unconscious. Demetrius realizes he has made a mistake, prays to God, and Lucia awakens. Demetrius takes the Robe to the Emperor, who takes it below to a prisoner. He has the prisoner killed and tries to resurrect him using the Robe. Furious that he cannot, Caligula accuses Demetrius of having brought him a fake, declaring both the Robe and Christ are frauds. Demetrius is horrified to learn that the Emperor had a prisoner killed in order attempt to use the power of the Robe to bring him back to life, and steps toward Caligula to attack him. He is stopped by the guards and on Caligula's orders is sent back to the arena. When the Emperor tries to have Demetrius executed, the Praetorian Guard (already angry at Caligula over worse pay and conditions) finally turns against Caligula and kills first Macro, the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, and then Caligula himself. Claudius is installed as Emperor by the Praetorian Guard almost immediately after Caligula is killed. Soon after his installation, Emperor Claudius says that he is neither a god, nor likely to become one anytime soon. Claudius says that he maintained the appearance of being weak to survive Caligula's rule, and that he would now take on the role of Emperor to the best of his ability. He gives Demetrius his final orders as a Tribune: to go to Peter and the other Christians, and tell them that as long as they do not act against the Empire they have nothing to fear from Claudius. Messalina re-vows her constancy to her husband. Demetrius and Glycon (William Marshall) (another virtuous gladiator) take the Robe to Peter, and the trio leaves the Imperial Palace together. CastProduction The sequel was planned even before The Robe had been released. It was originally known as The Story of Demetrius. Filming was completed by September 1953. i Reception Demetrius and the Gladiators was a massive commercial success. In its initial release, the film earned $4.25 million in US theatrical rentals,Aubrey Solomon, Twentieth Century Fox: A Corporate and Financial History, Scarecrow Press, 1989 p225'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', Variety Weekly, January 5, 1955 against a budget of less than $2 million. Overall, it grossed $26 million in North America, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1954. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times wrote that \\"we've got to hand it to Producer Frank Ross and Philip Dunne, the writer who put this one together out of whole cloth instead of 'The Robe' ... they have millinered this saga along straight Cecil B. Devotional lines, which means stitching on equal cuttings of spectacle, action, sex and reverence.\\"Crowther, Bosley (June 19, 1954). \\"The Screen: Demetrius Returns\\". The New York Times. 9.

Variety. June 2, 1954. 6. Edwin Schallert of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"As long as Mature is merely bluffing at being a gladiator, and trying at the same time to remain true to the principles of Christianity, the drama of the picture limps along ... Once Mature suddenly goes on a rampage as a fighter in the arena, 'Demetrius' takes on new life. It holds onto that animation most creditably even when its central character reforms.\\"Schallert, Edwin (June 17, 1954). \\"'Demetrius' Gains Good Final Summit\\". Los Angeles Times. Part III, p. 8. Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post stated, \\"Because there is less of the religious aspect of its Lloyd C. Douglas predecessor, and much more of the man-versus-lions-versus-men-versus-women-versus-vino of the early Cecil B. DeMille school herein, I suspect that, moviewise at least, 'Demetrius and the Gladiators' is a more enjoyable, less stuffy entertainment.\\"Coe, Richard L. (July 10, 1954). \\"Sequel to 'Robe' Opens Your Eyes\\". The Washington Post. 6. Harrison's Reports wrote, \\"Excellent! As a general rule, it is too much to hope that a sequel to an outstanding picture will be as good as the original, but 'Demetrius and the Gladiators,' which is a CinemaScope sequel to 'The Robe,' is one of the rare exceptions to the rule, for it not only matches the spectacular production quality of the original but also surpasses it in entertainment appeal.\\"\\"'Demetrius and the Gladiators' with Victor Mature and Susan Hayward\\". Harrison's Reports. June 5, 1954. 90. The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"This sequel to The Robe seems much less inhibited by religious awe than its predecessor.

The district covers all of the city of Stafford and is controlled by the city, making it the only school district in Texas that is not an independent school district operated by an independent school board. There are five schools on the campus of Stafford Municipal School District. The Primary/Elementary School building houses grades Pre-K through 4, the Intermediate School building houses grades 5 through 6, and the Middle/High School building houses grades 7 through 12. The administration building and athletic facilities are on the same campus as the school buildings. As of the beginning of the new 2019-2020 school year, a new building is being built. The purpose of the building is unknown, but some people think that this new building will be a 5-7 grades. The building will also have 3 layers. That would mean that the other schools, for example the intermediate might have another use other than 5-6 grades. The Stafford MSD area is served by the Houston Community College System. In 2018, the school district was rated an overall B by the Texas Education Agency. History In 1977, Stafford schools broke away from the Fort Bend Independent School District, which caused several rounds of federal litigation and by 1981 it was finally declared that the Stafford Municipal School District was constitutional. Almost all of Stafford was in the Fort Bend District, with a minuscule portion in the Houston Independent School District.\\"Comptroller Strayhorn to Review Stafford Municipal School District.\\" Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts.

Politics and geography While Stafford MSD is a part of the City of Stafford and took all of the land in the city in 1977 when it was created, Stafford MSD cannot annex any territory without the consent of the other school districts which own that territory. Because of this, the City of Stafford, for a period of over 20 years ending in 2006, did not annex any territory in its extraterritorial jurisdiction as that would mean portions of its territory would fall within these independent school districts: Alief, Ft.

Biography Born in Montreal, Quebec, he gained his B.Sc. (1947) and M.Sc. (1948) from the Universit√© de Montr√©al and his PhD in 1950 at McGill University. During his time at the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research he discovered the Fujimoto-Belleau reaction, which is named after him and George I. Fujimoto. After various academic research postings in the U.S. and Canada he became Professor of Chemistry at the University of Ottawa in 1961. He moved to McGill University in 1971. Belleau worked in the 1960s and 1970s on research programs with Bristol Laboratories, one of which led to the non-narcotic analgesic Butorphanol. Butorphanol was found to have over five times the potency of morphine with far fewer side effects. Butorphanol is often used to relieve post-surgical pain and in the management of migraine headaches. In the mid-1980s he helped found what became the biotech company BioChem Pharma with colleagues Francesco Bellini and Gervais Dionne. The trio began work on the anti-AIDS drug, 2,3 dideoxy ‚Äì 3-thiacytidine (3TC). Just prior to his death in 1989 he laid the foundations for Lamivudine's development, which was a significant advance in the fight against AIDS, and is credited with saving over 2 million lives.http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=142:belleau- aids&catid;=60:belleau-aids&Itemid;=141 In 1981, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Career Nouma started his career in the Paris Saint-Germain youth team before moving around other teams in France. He played for Lille and Caen before moving back to PSG for two seasons in 1994. He helped PSG win both the 1994‚Äì95 Coupe de la Ligue and the 1994‚Äì95 Coupe de France, playing as a substitute in both finals, the latter against future club Strasbourg. He also scored as PSG won the 1995 Troph√©e des Champions. In 1996 he left for Strasbourg, winning the Coupe de la Ligue there in 1997 and staying for two seasons, before moving to Lens. While at Lens he played in the final as they won the 1998‚Äì99 Coupe de la Ligue, which was the third time he'd won the trophy in five seasons and with three different teams. After two seasons at Lens, he left for Turkish club Be≈üikta≈ü, where he achieved phenomenal success and still maintains his popularity among Be≈üikta≈ü fans, who composed special songs for him. He played for them for one season before moving to play for Marseille the next year. He returned for a short spell at Be≈üikta≈ü the next season, but received a seven-month suspension for celebrating a goal against arch-rivals Fenerbah√ße by putting his hands down his shorts, a gesture he described as \\"a private moment of joy\\". The Be≈üikta≈ü board were forced to cancel his contract as a result. The incident did not diminish his popularity with Be≈üikta≈ü fans, who still look back fondly on his lob shot against Dynamo Kiev in the third round of the UEFA Cup in 2003.

Masonic lodges may meet in rooms in taverns and other public meeting places, and all Lodges appoint a Tyler to guard the door from the outside against ineligible masons or malicious or curious people, to check the eligibility of latecomers, and to ensure that candidates for ceremonies in the Lodge are properly prepared. Although a junior Officer of the Lodge and often a highly experienced Past Master, he may often be considered akin to a sergeant: in some cases the Tyler may not be an unpaid member of the lodge, but a mason from another lodge employed for the purpose. Other duties often involve preparing the room for meetings, supplying regalia and equipment, serving as bar steward or acting as permanent, and sometimes resident, caretaker of the furniture and premises. Duties of the post Night, a print by William Hogarth. The figure on the left (with the square) is the Master of a lodge, probably escorted by his Tyler.http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/biography/hogarth_w/night.html In some Jurisdictions the Tyler is appointed by the Worshipful Master, while in others he is elected by the members of the Lodge. He is charged with examining the Masonic credentials of anyone wishing to enter the Lodge and keeping unqualified persons from infiltrating Masonic meetings, and admitting only those qualified to attend the current business. In most jurisdictions, the Tyler is required to be outside the Lodge door for large portions of the meeting, although usually in a position to overhear the proceedings. The position has often been given to a deserving Mason who has fallen on hard times, such as the original Grand Master Anthony Sayer, or to a senior Lodge member who can help and advise those kept waiting outside. In some jurisdictions, the Worshipful Master has the authority to permit or direct the Tyler to \\"tyle from within\\" during the non-ritualistic portions of a meeting. If tyling from within, the Tyler must first secure the outer doors of the Tyler's anteroom. He would then leave the inner door open between the lodge room and the Tyler's anteroom, and sit at the seat closest to the door, still holding his drawn sword. Tyling from within enables the Tyler to participate in the business portions of the meeting, voice his opinions, volunteer for committees, deliver reports, and receive instruction if any be given. In other jurisdictions, such as the United Grand Lodge of England, the Tyler is always expected to be outside the closed door of the lodge; on the rare occasions when the Tyler enters the lodge room, another lodge member (typically the Inner Guard or, in the U.S., the Junior Deacon) goes outside to take temporary responsibility for guarding the door. Origins of the term The origins of the term are uncertain and a number of hypotheses have been presented over time. Masonic lodges originally met in inns or taverns, and Tyler is an Old English word for the keeper of an inn door. Alternatively, the name may simply come from the occupation of tyler‚Äîa person who lays roof and floor tiles. More fanciful suggestions have included: * Possibly related to the name of Wat Tyler, or Walter the Tyler, the leader of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. Born in Blood: Lost Secrets of Freemasonry by John J Robinson pub 1999 * Possibly a revision of the word tether, used to tie the door closed. * Possibly owing to the tiles being those stones or bricks which seal the structural masonry, whether they be on floors, walls or roofs. Likewise, the Tyler seals the remainder of the activities of the lodge. In popular culture William Hogarth's famous print of Night shows a drunken Mason being helped home by the Tyler, from one of the four original Lodges in 1717 at the Rummer & Grapes tavern.

The area that was opened to settlement included all or part of the Canadian, Cleveland, Kingfisher, Logan, Oklahoma, and Payne counties of the US state of Oklahoma. The land run started at high noon on April 22, 1889, with an estimated 50,000 people lined up for their piece of the available two million acres (8,000 km2). The Unassigned Lands were considered some of the best unoccupied public land in the United States. The Indian Appropriations Act of 1889 was passed and signed into law with an amendment by Illinois Representative William McKendree Springer that authorized President Benjamin Harrison to open the two million acres (8,000 km¬≤) for settlement. President Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act of 1862 which allowed settlers to claim lots of up to , provided that they lived on the land and improved it.  Native American tribes in Indian Territory  Map of Oklahoma 1892 The removal of Native Americans to Indian Territory started after the election of Andrew Jackson in 1828. The federal government was unwilling to help the tribes in Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi fight against state laws passed against them. President Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act on May 28, 1830. = Choctaw = The Choctaws were the first tribe to concede to removal in 1830. They agreed to give up their land and move to the designated Indian Territory. The main portions of the Choctaw tribe moved to Indian Territory from 1830‚Äì1833, with the promise that they would be granted autonomy. Many perished on the journey to the new territory. = Creek = The Creeks were the next tribe to move to Indian Territory. In 1829 a council was held and it was agreed that they would submit to state laws and stay on their lands. However, pressure from settlers and the state government lead to the Creek Tribe surrendering its lands to the state of Alabama. By 1836, the entire Creek Tribe had been removed to Oklahoma after the killing and pillaging of white settlers and a civil war within the tribe. = Cherokee = The Cherokees were the third tribe to be removed to Indian Territory. Tribal leaders Chief John Ross, and other high ranking families did the most they could to keep their lands. Jackson actively refused to enforce the ruling in the Worcester v. Georgia case, ruling that the Cherokee Nation was a community that had its own boundaries and the citizens of Georgia could not enter their lands without consent of the Cherokee Tribe. The necessity to leave Georgia to Oklahoma became inevitable to Chief John Ross. Eventually the U.S. military came and forced the removal of the Cherokees to Indian Territory. By the end of 1838, the Cherokee tribe had been fully removed to Oklahoma. Out of the 18,000 that made the trip from 1835 to 1838, about 4,000 perished. = Chickasaw = The Chickasaws elected to leave their lands freely and did not suffer like the Cherokee tribe. The tribe was progressing by frontier standards in that they were educating children, building churches, and farming. They were faced with the problem of the federal government not being able to protect them from the state government of Mississippi. Beginning in 1832 a collection of treaties were signed, granting them better terms than the other tribes had received. They left for Oklahoma in the winter of 1837‚Äì38 and paid the Choctaws to be able to settle on their lands. = Seminole = The Seminole Tribe was tricked into signing a removal treaty and the Seminole War is what followed. This was the bloodiest and costliest Indian war in United States history. Chief Osceola and his tribe hid in the Everglades in Florida, and the military sought to hunt them down. Many were captured and sent to Oklahoma in chains. Osceola surrendered and died in prison. The war and removal reduced their population by 40%, and only 2,254 were left in 1859 according to the 1859 census. = Plains Tribes in the Territory = After the removal of the Five Civilized Tribes, they were later joined by tribes of the plains who were forced into the territory after wars with the U.S. military. The Quapaws and Senecas were placed in Northeast Oklahoma with the Cherokees. They were later joined by the Shawnees, Delawares, and Kickapoos by 1845. After the entrance of Texas into the Union, the Caddos, Kiowas, and parts of the Comanche tribe were placed in Indian Territory after treaties with the Civilized Tribes. By 1880, the Wyandots, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Wichitas, and other smaller tribes had been removed from surrounding states and placed into Oklahoma.  Start of the Boomer Movement  Americans at this time were facing the troubles of land overpopulation in the east where millions of people were occupying only thousands of square miles of land. The Civil War had also just ended, sparking people's interest in occupying the west. The only problem was the Indian Territory was not open to settlers at this crucial time. Americans called for their legislators to open the Indian Territory and certain Native Americans like Elias C. Boudinot encouraged other Native Americans to participate in the effort to welcome westward expansion. As a result, thirty-three bills were presented before congress introducing legislation to open the territory for settlement in the course of ten years from 1870 to 1879. Legislation was passed through Congress in 1866 that permitted railroads to be laid in sections of on either sides of the Indian Territory. The two companies in charge of creating these railroads were the Atlantic and the Pacific, although their contracts were eventually rescinded due to not finishing the projects in the agreed time. Railroad companies that came up after them took it as their responsibility to finish the project, and saw a way to strengthen their contracts by introducing the movement of white settlement in the Indian Territory. The Railroads employed people like C. C. Carpenter to spread false information in newspapers of the Indian Territory being open to settlement through Congress's Homestead laws. The articles were a success as a large movement of black and white settlers began to move to the Oklahoma Territory. The President of that time, Rutherford B. Hayes, issued warnings to the boomers to not move into the Indian land, and issued commands to the military to use force to ensure this. Boomers and Sooners \\"The Oklahoma Land Rush, April 22, 1889\\", by 351x351px A number of the people who participated in the run entered the unoccupied land early and hid there until the legal time of entry to lay quick claim to some of the most choice homesteads. These people came to be identified as \\"Sooners\\". This led to hundreds of legal contests that arose and were decided first at local land offices and eventually by the U.S. Department of the Interior. Arguments included what constituted the \\"legal time of entry\\". While some people think that the settlers who entered the territory at the legally appointed time were known as \\"boomers\\", the term actually refers to those who campaigned for the opening of the lands, led by David L. Payne. The University of Oklahoma's fight song, \\"Boomer Sooner\\", derives from these two names.What is a Sooner. SoonerAthletics. University of Oklahoma.

Then once settled in the Oklahoma Territory they organized themselves as a town-site company that sold lots of land from a range of $2‚Äì25 depending on the demand of the Boomer Movement. Cattlemen, afraid that these boomers would take their land, worked to keep them out alongside the military. Settlers thought it their right to occupy the lands as they had purchased it with cash and by doing so, their title was invested in the U.S. government. Even so, the military was at constant work to arrest the boomers unlawfully on Indian Territory, although they were generally released without having to go on trial. On November 28, 1884, Captain David L. Payne met his end at a hotel in Kansas due to poison found in his glass of milk. It is speculated that it was organized by cattlemen unhappy with the success of the Boomer Movement. = William Couch = William Couch was a former lieutenant under Payne. He did not possess the brash personality of his predecessor, however, he had a kindred personality and spoke with strength. He rigorously studied all treaties, court cases, and laws regarding the Oklahoma land issue in order to present logical and concise boomer claims. He had led unsuccessful movements into Indian Territory, but under military and legal pressure the Oklahoma movement stagnated. It was rebooted with the construction of the Santa Fe Railroad line across the middle of Indian Territory from Arkansas City, Kansas to Gainesville, Texas. Certain that the lands would be opened to settlement shortly after the construction of the railroad was completed in the spring of 1887, the Oklahoma movement again slowed down. By December 1887 the inaction of Congress reignited the movement behind the leadership of William Couch. After a conference of boomers was held in Kansas, the conference sent delegates Sydney Clarke, Samuel Crocker, and William Couch to Washington to promote the passage of an act to open Oklahoma lands for settlement. After Couch and company presented the bill to Congress, it faced opposition from state representatives George T. Barnes of Georgia, Charles E. Hooker of Mississippi, and Colonel G.W. Harkins of the Chickasaw Nation. They opposed it based on the premise that the U.S. government had promised the land to the Indian Nations living there and the government did not have the right to open up land in the territory to settlement. The Springer Oklahoma Bill, which was proposed by Illinois representative William M. Springer, was meant to use the Homestead Act to open the lands for settlement. Arguments over the payment for the lands went up until the legislative session ended and the bill was not passed. In December, Couch presented the Springer Oklahoma Bill to Congress again, which led to the passage of the Indian Appropriation Bill. With this bill, Congress paid $1,912,952.02 to the Seminole and Creek Nations in exchange for 2,370,414.62 acres of unassigned land. A section giving the president the authority to open the land to white settlement was added. = African-Americans = African Americans had been trying to find communities they could settle without the worries of racism against them. During the time that the Land Rush took place, black families were building their own way of life and culture since the Reconstruction era. Even in the Oklahoma Territory, the five main Native American Tribes had to sign agreements with the US government that they would no longer practice slavery, and if they continued, they would be exempted from their land by the United States. During the Land Rush, it was a growing belief within the African American community that this opening of free land was their opportunity to create communities of their very own, without the influence of racism. Their intentions were to make Oklahoma a state just for them. One organization that took advantage of this movement was the Oklahoma Immigration Organization owned by W. L. Eagleson. Eagleson spread the announcement of recolonization to the black community throughout the United States, especially focused in the South.U.S. land office after the Land Rush of 1889.One attempt to make Oklahoma a black state was to appoint Edward Preston McCabe as the Governor of the Oklahoma Territory. This would make it easier for black families to settle within the region during the land rush. This plan fell through the cracks, as there seemed to be less and less excitement of immigrating to the new land, and instead McCabe had to settle to being a treasurer in Logan County of Oklahoma. The attempts of people like Eagleson and McCabe were not completely futile as their support of the black family did enthuse many to continue to move to the Oklahoma Territory. These movements did become townships, such as Kingfisher.  Rush for land  Settlers waiting to stake their claims on the unassigned lands. After the passage of the Indian Appropriation Bill, President Benjamin Harrison made the declaration that on April 22, 1889, at 12 o'clock noon that the Unassigned Land in Indian Territory would be open for settlement. At the time of the opening, which was indicated by gunshot, and the line of people on horse and in wagons dispersed into a kaleidoscope of motion and dust and oxen and wagons. The chase for land was frenzied and much chaos and disorder ensued. The rush did not last long, and by the end of the day nearly two million acres of land had been claimed. By the end of the year, 62,000 settlers lived in the Unassigned Lands located between the Five Tribes on the east and the Plains Tribes on the west. Rapid growth By the end of the day (April 22, 1889), both Oklahoma City and Guthrie had established cities of around 10,000 people in literally half a day. As Harper's Weekly put it: > At twelve o'clock on Monday, April 22d, the resident population of Guthrie > was nothing; before sundown it was at least ten thousand. In that time > streets had been laid out, town lots staked off, and steps taken toward the > formation of a municipal government. Many settlers immediately started improving their new land or stood in line waiting to file their claim. Many children sold creek water to homesteaders waiting in line for five cents a cup, while other children gathered buffalo dung to provide fuel for cooking. By the second week, schools had opened and were being taught by volunteers paid by pupils' parents until regular school districts could be established. Within one month, Oklahoma City had five banks and six newspapers. On May 2, 1890, the Oklahoma Organic Act was passed creating the Oklahoma Territory. This act included the Panhandle of Oklahoma within the territory. It also allowed for central governments and designated Guthrie as the territory's capital. = Expansion of cities = With the signal of troops to cross into the territory, over a dozen Santa Fe trains pulled into Oklahoma Territory, and most others traveled by other means‚Äîon horseback, in wagons, and on foot. Establishing a claim involved placing a stake with the claimant's name and place of entry at a U.S. land, one of which was located in Guthrie and the other in Kingfisher. The settler had to live on the claimed section of land for a five-year period before they could attain the title to the property. That period could be shortened to fourteen months if the settler paid a price of $1.25 per acre. Guthrie, Oklahoma City, Kingfisher, El Reno, Norman, and Stillwater were six of the townsites established in 1889 and they were given county seats. Guthrie was named capital of the Territory and later was capital of the state of Oklahoma for a brief period. Oklahoma City then became the permanent capital of the state. On April 23, Oklahoma City contained more than 12,000 people. Within an hour of land being opened, 2,500 settlers occupied lands in their township that they initially named Lisbon, but would later be called Kingfisher. In popular culture * Hollywood has produced motion pictures illustrating the Oklahoma Land Run of 1889 and the way of a pioneer's life on the acreaged claims. Two of these, both named Cimarron, were based upon the 1929 novel of the same name by Edna Ferber: **Cimarron (1931): directed by Wesley Ruggles; screenplay cast includes Richard Dix, Irene Dunne, and Estelle Taylor. It was an Academy Award Winner for Best Art Direction, Best Picture, Best Writing and Adaptation. ** Cimarron (1960): directed by Anthony Mann and Charles Walters; screenplay cast includes Glenn Ford, Maria Schell, and Anne Baxter. * The Oklahoma City 89ers was the original name for the Oklahoma City Triple-A Minor League Baseball from 1962 to 1997, when the team played at the now-demolished All Sports Stadium at the state fairgrounds. The team is currently known as the Oklahoma City Dodgers. Among the most notable players for the 89ers were Juan Gonzalez, National Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ryne Sandberg, Rub√©n Sierra and Sammy Sosa. * The 1992 film Far and Away, starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, depicts a young Irish couple fleeing to the States with hopes of participating in the Oklahoma Run and staking claim to their own land. * The Rush is also the central theme of the comic album Ru√©e sur l'Oklahoma, the 14th album of the Belgian comics series Lucky Luke.

According to the newspaper The Daily Telegraph, the namesake of the collection and then the museum, the Roman Torlonia family, received ownership of the collection around 1800 or in the early 19th century. The previous owners, the Giustiniani family, had taken out a loan from the Torlonia dynasty and secured it with the collection, but then defaulted on paying back the loan. (According to earlier information by the same newspaper, however, Prince Giovanni Torlonia himself was the founder of the collection when, in 1810, \\"he bought some works and unearthed others on his land in Portus\\".) Alessandro Torlonia, heir to Giovanni, opened the collection to visitors in their family palace on Via della Lungara, close to the Tiber River, in 1893. In the 1960s, the museum was dismantled and the 77-room palace was converted into a 93-unit apartment building. The collection was put into storage and has not been publicly displayed. In May 2005 the government attempted to buy the collection for 1.2 billion but the offer was declined.

It belongs to the National Trust and is a Grade I listed building. History Fountains Hall in 1830. The house was built by Stephen Proctor between 1598 and 1604, partly with stone from the abbey ruins. It is an example of a late Elizabethan prodigy house, perhaps influenced by the work of Robert Smythson. After Proctor's death in 1619, Fountains Hall passed into the possession of the Messenger family, who sold it to William Aislabie of neighbouring Studley Royal 150 years later. Fountains Hall became redundant as the Aislabie family remained at Studley Royal. It was leased to tenants and at one time parts of it were used for farm storage. The hall was renovated and modernised between 1928 and 1931, and the Duke and Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth) often stayed there as guests of Lady Doris Vyner, sister to the then-current Duke of Richmond and Gordon. During the Second World War, Fountains Hall and other estate buildings were used to house evacuees. Studley Royal became the wartime home of Queen Ethelburga's School from Harrogate and the school's sanatorium was at Fountains Hall. The stable block and courtyard was used for dormitories while one corner became the school chapel, at which Sunday Evensong was regularly said by the Archdeacon of Ripon. The hall has a balcony although it cannot be used because the staircase is considered unsafe for the public. Vyner memorial The Vyners lost a son and a daughter in the Second World War; Charles was a Royal Naval Reserve pilot missing in action near Rangoon. Elizabeth was a member of the Women's Royal Naval Service and died of lethargic encephalitis while on service in Felixstowe, Suffolk. There is a sculpture remembering them which can be seen as one comes out of the house down the stone steps. Its text, which begins with an epitaph written by John Maxwell Edmonds, reads: Vyner Memorial Window in staircase > WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL THEM OF US AND SAY FOR YOUR TOMORROW WE GAVE OUR TODAY > FROM THIS THEIR HOME, THEY WENT FORTH TO WAR. > Elizabeth Vyner WRNS - Died on Active Service June 3rd 1942 Aged 18 years. > Also her brother Charles De Grey Vyner Sub Lieut (A) RNVR Reported missing > from Air Operations Off Rangoon May 2nd 1945 Aged 19 Years. '' After the war the hall again fell into a state of dilapidation. The National Trust acquired the Fountains Estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983 and has restored the hall. Part of it has been divided into flats, one of which is a holiday let. Visitors to Fountains Abbey can view the oak-panelled stone hall and an adjoining exhibition room, and there are plans to restore the chapel. Ghost stories Balcony at Fountains Hall The Hall has several reported hauntings. Years ago, when the best route into the main area of Fountains Hall was through a side entrance, visitors would report the sensation of an invisible figure running at them as they walked along the corridor and brushing past them as they walked through to the main part of the house. The Great Hall at Fountains Hall has the sound of musicians rehearsing a piece of music - the sound of a spinet and wind instruments are heard through the walls together with a woman's voice going through the same musical phrase several times and indistinctly, yet as soon as the door to the Great Hall is opened the music stops. The bedroom adjoining a former staff flat on the first floor is haunted by a \\"shining golden lady\\" in eighteenth century dress. A former resident of the Hall during its time as staff accommodation commented that this apparition would appear to children living there at that time when they were sick in bed - she would come and sit beside them and stroke their hair. Previous occupants of the same rooms on the first floor have also reported the ghost of a dog and another apparition of a dark figure carrying a lighted candle. The main staircase at the back of the Hall is haunted by the sound of two children at play - their voices are heard and the sound of them moving up and down the staircase, with the sound of rainfall in the background even if the weather outside is sunny.

It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work Capitalism and Schizophrenia. While the first volume, Anti-Oedipus (1972), sought to \\"short- circuit\\" a developing \\"bureaucracy of analytic reason\\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), A Thousand Plateaus was created as a \\"positive exercise\\" in nomadology and rhizomatic philosophy. The book has been considered to be a major statement of post-structuralism and postmodernism, especially starting in the late 20th century. Brian Massumi's English translation was published in 1987, a year after the twelfth \\"plateau\\" was published separately in English as Nomadology: The War Machine (New York: Semiotext[e], 1986). Summary Like the first volume of Deleuze and Guattari's Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Anti-Oedipus (1972), A Thousand Plateaus is politically and terminologically provocative and is intended as a work of schizoanalysis, but focuses more on what could be considered systematic, environmental and spatial philosophy, often dealing with the natural world, popular culture, measurements and mathematics. A \\"plateau\\", borrowed from ideas in Gregory Bateson's research on Balinese culture, is \\"a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities\\"; the chapters in the book are described as plateaus, while their respective dates also signify a level of intensity, where \\"each plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau.\\" Deleuze and Guattari describe the book itself as a rhizome due to how it was written and produced. A Thousand Plateaus has been described as dealing with their ideas of the rhizome, as well as the body without organs, the plane of immanence, abstract machines, becoming, lines of flight, assemblages, smooth and striated space, state apparatuses, faciality, performativity in language, binary branching structures in language, deterritorialization and reterritorialization, arborescence, pragmatics, strata, stratification and destratification, the war machine, the signified, signifier and sign, and coding/recoding. In the plateaus (chapters) of the book, they discuss psychoanalysts (Freud, Jung, Lacan--who trained Guattari, and Melanie Klein), composers (Chopin, Debussy, Mozart, Pierre Boulez, and Olivier Messiaen), artists (Klee, Kandinsky, and Pollock), philosophers (Husserl, Foucault, Bergson, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and Gilbert Simondon), historians (Ibn Khaldun, Georges Dum√©zil, and Fernand Braudel), and linguists (Chomsky, Labov, Benveniste, Guillaume, Austin, Hjelmslev, and Voloshinov). Deleuze and Guattari highly favor and criticize these figures, sometimes overlapping or \\"plugging\\" their statements, works, research, studies and fragments \\"into each other\\". The book starts with an introduction titled \\"Rhizome\\" that explains rhizomatic philosophy (addressing not just the book itself but all books as rhizomes), and ends with a conclusion, \\"Concrete Rules and Abstract Machines\\", that fully elaborates on and intertwines all of the major concepts in the book, as well as Anti-Oedipus, with a numbering system representing plateaus. In between are thirteen chapters, each dated non- linearly, sometimes precisely (\\"November 28, 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?\\"), sometimes less so (\\"10,000 B.C.: The Geology of Morals (Who Does the Earth Think It Is?)\\"). In the sixth chapter, \\"Year Zero: Faciality\\" (visag√©it√©), the notion of face is discussed as an \\"overcoding\\" of body, but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (paysag√©it√©). Faciality, the essence of the face, is ultimately a dominating and dangerously compelling trait of bodies, and Deleuze and Guattari remark that the face \\"is a whole body unto itself: it is like the body of the center of significance to which all of the deterritorialized signs affix themselves, and it marks the limit of their deterritorialization.\\" Like Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari evaluate and criticize psychoanalysis: in the first two chapters, they discuss the work of Sigmund Freud, especially referring to the case histories of the Wolf Man and Little Hans. Their schizoanalysis of Freud's cases refuses the Oedipalization they were previously given, and aims to exercise the content of their fantasies instead; \\"Look at what happened to Little Hans already [...] they kept on breaking his rhizome and blotching his map, setting it straight for him, blocking his every way out, until he began to desire his own shame and guilt, until they had rooted shame and guilt in him\\". In particular, focusing on child psychoanalysis, they remark that \\"children are Spinozists.\\" Meanwhile, owing to their mode of literary analysis, A Thousand Plateaus also frequently discusses novels. In \\"1874: Three Novellas, or \\"What Happened?\\"\\", they discuss Henry James' In the Cage (1898) and \\"The Story of the Abyss and the Spyglass\\" by Pierrette Fleutiaux, but they also evoke F. Scott Fitzgerald's essay The Crack-Up (1945) (which Deleuze previously discussed in The Logic of Sense), because his depression and frustration in the essay is dramatized, and Deleuze's idea of the crack constitutes a narrativized breakdown. The works of Franz Kafka, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, Henry Miller, D. H. Lawrence, Carlos Castaneda, H. P. Lovecraft, Herman Melville and Chr√©tien de Troyes are also discussed, often in conjunction with the rhizome, becoming, faciality, and the regimes of signs. Reception A Thousand Plateaus has been considered a major statement of post-structuralism and postmodernism.For example, Steven Best and Douglas Kellner's Postmodern Theory (Guilford Press, 1991) devoted a chapter to Deleuze and Guattari. Mark Poster writes that the work \\"contains promising elaborations of a postmodern theory of the social and political.\\" Writing in the foreword to his translation, Massumi comments that the work \\"is less a critique than a positive exercise in the affirmative 'nomad' thought called for in Anti-Oedipus.\\" Massumi contrasts \\"nomad thought\\" with the \\"state philosophy... that has characterized Western metaphysics since Plato\\". Deleuze critic Eugene Holland suggests that the work complicates the slogans and oppositions developed in its predecessor. Whereas Anti-Oedipus created binaries such as molar/molecular, paranoid/schizophrenic, and deterritorialization/reterritorialization, A Thousand Plateaus shows how such distinctions are operations on the surface of a deeper field with more complicated and multidimensional dynamics. In so doing, the book is less engaged with history than with topics like biology and geology.Eugene W. Holland, \\"Deterritorializing 'deterritorialization'‚ÄîFrom the Anti-Oedipus to A Thousand Plateaus\\", SubStance #66 (Vol. 3, No. 9), 1991, accessed via JStor. Massumi writes that A Thousand Plateaus differs drastically in tone, content, and composition from Anti-Oedipus. In his view, the schizoanalysis the authors practice is not so much a study of their \\"pathological condition\\", but a \\"positive process\\" that involves \\"inventive connection\\". Bill Readings appropriates the term \\"singularity\\" from A Thousand Plateaus, \\"to indicate that there is no longer a subject-position available to function as the site of the conscious synthesis of sense-impressions.\\" The sociologist Nikolas Rose writes that Deleuze and Guattari articulate \\"the most radical alternative to the conventional image of subjectivity as coherent, enduring, and individualized\\". In 1997, the physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont asserted that the book contains many passages in which Deleuze and Guattari use \\"pseudo-scientific language\\".: \\"Should the reader entertain any further doubts about the ubiquity of pseudo-scientific language in Deleuze and Guattari's work, he or she is invited to consult [...] pages 32-33, 142-143, 211-212, 251-252, 293-295, 361-365, 369-374, 389-390, 461, 469-473, and 482-490 of A Thousand Plateaus.\\" Writing about this \\"science wars critique,\\" Daniel Smith and John Protevi contend that \\"much of their chapter on Deleuze consists of exasperated exclamations of incomprehension.\\" Similarly, in a 2015 interview, British philosopher Roger Scruton characterized A Thousand Plateaus as \\"[a] huge, totally unreadable tome by somebody who can‚Äôt write French.\\" At the beginning of a short essay on postmodernism, Jean-Fran√ßois Lyotard lists examples of what he describes as a desire \\"to put an end to experimentation\\", including a displeased reaction to A Thousand Plateaus that he had read in a weekly literary magazine, which said that readers of philosophy \\"expect [...] to be \\"gratified with a little sense\\". Behind this \\"slackening\\" desire to constrain language use, Lyotard identifies a \\"desire for a return to terror.\\" Digital media theorist Janet Murray links the work to the aesthetic of hypertext. Gaming and electronic literature expert Espen Aarseth draws parallels between Deleuze and Guattari's idea of the rhizome and semiotician Umberto Eco's idea of the net. Christopher Miller criticizes Deleuze and Guattari's use of \\"second-hand\\" anthropological sources without providing the reader with contextualization of the colonialist \\"mission\\" that led to their writing. Timothy Laurie says that this claim is inaccurate, but that Deleuze & Guattari should extend that same \\"rigor\\" to uncovering the political and economic entanglements which contextualize academic philosophy. Influence A Thousand Plateaus was an influence on the political philosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's book Empire (2000). The sociologist John Urry sees Deleuze and Guattari's metaphor of the nomad as having \\"infected contemporary social thought.\\" The philosopher Manuel DeLanda, in A New Philosophy of Society (2006), adopts Deleuze's theory of assemblages, taken from A Thousand Plateaus.

It is the first instalment in the Molly Moon six- book series. Amber Entertainment and Lipsync Productions produced a film adaptation, Molly Moon and the Incredible Book of Hypnotism, which was released on April 11, 2015.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2445178/?ref_=ttco_co_tt Plot Molly Moon, an orphan at Hardwick House Orphanage in Briersville, England, is living a \\"boring and plain\\" life with her best friend Rocky Scarlet, another orphan. She is described as being plain looking with a large \\"potato\\" nose, wobbly knees and green eyes. She is usually beaten down upon by Ms. Adderstone, the woman in charge of the orphanage, and Hazel, a snobby orphan girl. During school, Molly and Rocky have a fight and Molly storms away to the town library. As she walks in, she finds a man yelling at the librarian about a book he ordered, but ignores him. While looking in a curious compartment of the restricted section, she finds a book on hypnotism, placed in the wrong section because the \\"H\\" was ripped off the spine. Intrigued, she steals it and sneaks out of the library. She takes it to the orphanage to read it. She fakes being ill so that she can study the book better. Curiously, she finds that chapters 7 and 8 (\\"Voice-Only Hypnosis\\" and \\"Long Distance Hypnosis\\") are missing. Not long after her discovery of the book, she learns that Rocky has been adopted and taken to America with his new family. Determined to see her friend again, she gains the actual ability to hypnotize from the lessons in her book, first successfully hypnotizing the orphanage dog, Petula. Later on, she is able to hypnotize both Ms. Adderstone and their orphanage chef Edna. Using her ability, Molly wins a large sum of money from a local talent competition, by hypnotizing the crowd into believing that she is a talented singer and dancer. She uses the money to fly to New York City, taking Petula with her. Before leaving, she buys a large gold pendulum, where the mysterious professor from the library learns about her, after he bought some anti- hypnosis glasses. She also hypnotizes Ms. Adderstone and Edna to be nice to all children. Soon after arriving, Molly hypnotizes her way onto Broadway, landing the lead role in a musical called \\"Stars on Mars\\". However, she steals this part from a real child star, named Davina Nuttel, in the process. The show is a roaring success, and catches the attention of a man named Simon Nockman, who has passed himself off as a \\"professor\\" of hypnosis, but is truly just a criminal. He theorizes Molly must have obtained the book and learned hypnosis, and formulates a plan. After one performance of \\"Stars on Mars\\", Nockman kidnaps Petula, threatening to kill her if Molly does not comply with his orders, and she cannot hypnotize him because he always wears the anti- hypnotic glasses he bought in Briersville. He orders her to use her talents to steal some rare jewels from a bank for him. Having no choice, Molly agrees. All goes as planned with the robbery until she finds Rocky, who much to her surprise has also learned hypnosis. He had previously stolen and learned from the missing chapters of Molly's hypnotism book, \\"Long Distance Hypnosis\\" and \\"Voice-Only Hypnosis\\". He also reveals that he had intended to take Molly with him when he was adopted, but had not been able to hypnotize his parents. Since then, he left them as they were not much fun. Working together, the two successfully pull off the robbery, but later form a plan to return the jewels. Rocky uses his power of voice-only hypnotism to hypnotize Nockman into giving up his life of crime. He then helps Molly return the stolen jewels by placing them in hollow garden gnomes and placing them around the city. However, Molly keeps one diamond, which Petula found in her jacket. Molly gives her part in \\"Stars on Mars\\" back to Davina, and returns home with Rocky. Out of sympathy for the broken man, she takes Nockman with her. Before leaving, they work together to record a commercial, using their hypnotic powers to convince people to be kind to their kids. However, when they return, they find Ms. Adderstone and Edna have disappeared, believing that the children there will be happier without any grownups around to tell them what to do, leaving the orphanage in chaos. The older children, once close, have fought amongst themselves, and the younger children have hidden themselves away upstairs, too scared of the older children and the rats they think are living in the orphanage to venture down into the kitchen. With Nockman's help, Molly and Rocky get the orphanage back into a livable condition, and get the sweet- natured Ms. Trinklebury, the orphanage maid, to run it along with Nockman. The orphanage is renamed 'Happiness House' and the money that Molly earned in New York is used to buy new things and redecorate the orphanage. However, it is implied that Nockman has returned to his old ways as he steals a camera, a lollipop and five pounds from children in the orphanage. At the end of the book, Molly is mysteriously summoned to the library by the librarian, Lucy Logan. Lucy explains that she is the descendant of Professor Logan, the man who originally wrote the hypnotism book, and is a skilled hypnotist herself. She had purposely hypnotized Molly into finding Professor Logan's hypnotism book and keeping it for a month. Now, Molly has come back to return it. In an epilogue, it is revealed what happened to Ms. Adderstone and Edna; Ms. Adderstone left to become a pilot, and Edna is now an Italian chef.

In 2004, sales for the book increased to 102,589. The book won the Massachusetts Children's Book Award in 2006. In a starred review, Publishers Weekly stated the novel \\"offers delightfully dastardly villains, a sympathetic heroine who lives out every child's dream and plenty of fast-paced action.\\" Terry Miller Shannon from Kidsreads.com, in a positive review, felt that themes of friendship and responsibility added meaning to the story. A reviewer from Kirkus Reviews stated that although \\"Molly‚Äôs solutions to problems are amusing\\", \\"[t]he salvation of archetypically evil (and archetypically disgusting) villains is dissatisfying\\". Susan Rogers, writing in School Library Journal, compared the novel to A Series of Unfortunate Events, stating \\"Molly Moon's story doesn't match their clever and elegant way with words, but it does have something they lack-a satisfying and very moral ending.\\" Mary Thomas, in CM: An Electronic Reviewing Journal of Canadian Materials for Young People, gave the book two stars out of four, calling the book trite and derivative.

Background  An Austrian from an aristocratic family, Lahousen served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. After the war, he became a member of Austrian counterintelligence. However, after the Anschluss in 1938, Austria's intelligence services were absorbed into Germany's, and Lahousen joined the Abwehr, headed by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris.  Second World War  The men took well to each other, as both shared anti- Nazi feelings. Lahousen became a member of a circle of hand-picked officers opposed to Hitler who ran the intelligence agency. Canaris appointed him chief of Abwehr section II, which dealt primarily with the Brandenburgers and sabotage.Harry Carl Schaub, Books (J-Z) with abstract on the German Resistance to Hitler.

But because Canaris did not give as much a priority to sabotage as to espionage, Lahousen ordered that agents destined for Britain be trained primarily for spying, with disastrous results. Saboteurs who landed in the United States during Operation Pastorius in June 1942 were betrayed to the FBI by one of their number, arrested, tried by military tribunal, and executed.David Alan Johnson. Betrayal: The True Story of J. Edgar Hoover and the Nazi Saboteurs Captured During WWII (2007) Hippocrene Books, Inc. In 1943, Lahousen was sent to the Eastern Front and thus escaped the final days of the Abwehr, which, along with Canaris, had fallen into disfavour. Lahousen later claimed that he was the one who supplied the bomb used on the Smolensk plot (Operation Spark, 13 March 1943). The assassination attempt carried out by Fabian von Schlabrendorff failed. After the failure of the assassination attempt and putsch (20 July plot), Claus von Stauffenberg and thousands of other accused plotters, including Canaris, were executed. Due to his service at the front, Lahousen escaped notice. On 19 July 1944 Lahousen was heavily wounded by an artillery hit.  Nuremberg trial  After the end of the war, Lahousen voluntarily testified against Hermann G√∂ring and 21 other defendants at the Nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945‚Äì1946. Lahousen was the first witness for the prosecution, his prominence due to being the sole survivor of the 'Abwehr resistance'. Among other things, he gave evidence about the murder of hundreds of thousands of Soviet prisoners of war and the Einsatzgruppen death squads, who murdered more than a million Jews in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union, Poland and Ukraine.

Kane spent 36 years as a news anchor in Philadelphia, and is the only person to have anchored at all three Philadelphia owned and operated television stations. Early in his career, he was the only broadcast journalist to travel to every stop on the Beatles' 1964 and 1965 American tours. He has authored three books about the Beatles, as well as a memoir and a novel. Now semi-retired, he is a special contributor for KYW News Radio. BiographyEarly life= Kane was born in Brooklyn, New York. His parents changed the name years before his broadcasting career. Kane's father was an electrical contractor. His mother, Mildred Kane, fought multiple sclerosis for 14 years before her death at age 40. His work with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society began because of his mother's involvement with the disease. He began his career in broadcast journalism in Miami, Florida at age 16, first at WQAM and later at WAME and WFUN. While working at WAME, Kane became the first U.S. news correspondent to break the story of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961. =Work with the Beatles= As the only broadcast journalist to travel to every stop on the Beatles' 1964 and 1965 tours, Kane authored the book Ticket to Ride in 2003. Kane also authored Lennon Revealed, a New York Times and Los Angeles Times Bestseller in 2005. Kane is considered one of the premiere American experts on the life of John Lennon. On July 30, 2013, Kane's internationally distributed book, When They Were Boys: The True Story of the Beatles' Rise to the Top was released. Kane was also one of the contributors to Yoko Ono's 2005 book Memories of John Lennon, in which he recalled how Lennon cohosted the Philadelphia \\"Helping Hand Marathon\\" fundraiser in 1975 and gave a weather forecast on Kane's television newscast. =Career in Philadelphia= In 1965, he came to Philadelphia as an anchor for WFIL Radio and as main anchor for its sister station WFIL-TV, Philadelphia's ABC affiliate. Kane was the later the primary anchor for the (then new) Action News format. WFIL-TV would change its call letters to WPVI-TV in 1971 after Capital Cities Communications purchased the station from Triangle Publications. Kane is credited with coining the phrase \\"The Big Story\\" at the top of Action News, something WPVI uses to this day. Kane would leave WPVI in 1977, in order to take daily limousine trips to New York City and join WABC- TV. Kane was an anchor on New York's WABC-TV's Eyewitness News for one year from 1977 to 1978; during that time, he was the lead anchor the night after the infamous New York City blackout of 1977, accessed May 1, 2016 and also anchored news updates for ABC News.

Kane anchored the 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts at KYW until December 23, 2002. Kane covered local Philadelphia politics through hosting several public affairs programs. Kane was an anchor at WCAU when sources considered reliable tipped erroneously that Philadelphia mayor William J. Green was subject of federal investigation for improprieties. The story was later retracted, and Green sued CBS. In 1994, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Kane into their Hall of Fame. On November 22, 2002, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia presented him with their \\"Person of the Year\\" award, their highest honor. Until its 2017 shutdown, he hosted Larry Kane: Voice of Reason, a weekly news analysis program on the Comcast Network.

History The company was founded in 1964 on West 56th Street in New York City by 25-year-old Hiroaki Aoki, the father of Steve Aoki and Devon Aoki. Aoki, a wrestler who had qualified for but did not attend the 1960 Summer Olympics, started the restaurant with earned from driving an ice cream truck in Harlem. The first restaurant, Benihana of Tokyo, was named for the red safflower that was the name for the coffee shop owned by his parents in Tokyo. A chef preparing a dinner at the table Aoki's concept was for the meals to be theatrically prepared by a knife-wielding, joke-telling chef at a teppanyaki table surrounded by a wooden eating surface in front of the guests (Teppan meaning \\"steel grill\\" or \\"griddle\\" and yaki meaning \\"grilled\\" or \\"broiled\\"). It did not do well until early 1965, when Clementine Paddleford of the New York Herald Tribune gave it a rave review. The Beatles and Muhammad Ali were among the celebrities who then descended on the four- table restaurant. Within a year Aoki opened a bigger restaurant that featured samurai armor, heavy wooden ceiling beams, and sliding sh≈çji screens to provide some privacy. In 1968, it opened its first restaurant outside of New York City in Chicago. In 1976, Aoki brought in consultant Hardwicke Companies (its founder Charles H. Stein was the original developer of Six Flags Great Adventure as well as operated various New York restaurants including Tavern on the Green) as a partner to run the company. In 1980, Aoki terminated the relationship and settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission complaint of insider trading of Hardwicke stock. In 1982, Benihana National Corporation went public with Joel Schwartz as president. Some of the restaurants continued to be privately owned by Aoki. The company had some missteps including the opening of the upscale Big Splash restaurant and a frozen food division Benihana National Classics. Its stock dived and shareholders sued over management including the fact that Aoki still had his privately held restaurants of the same name. In 1995, the company acquired 17 restaurants from Benihana of Tokyo. The company has since expanded by purchasing the Haru and RA Sushi restaurants, which operate under those names. Haru is based in New York City; RA has locations across the country, and is based in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its original four locations scattered around the greater Phoenix area. Although Benihana owns these concepts, they are independently operated and were developed autonomously. It also acquired the Samurai and Kyoto restaurants which it has incorporated into its other brands. In 2004, the company issued a class of preferred stock to BFC Financial corporation to renovate its restaurants and expand. The stock diluted Aoki's control of the chain and the family sued, citing that Benihana had no compelling need for the cash, other forms of capital were available, and that the terms of the preferred stock issued to BFC were onerous. A member of the board of directors was also a director of BFC, a company that held controlling interests in BankAtlantic, Blue Green, and Levitt Homes. However, the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the decision. Benihana's famous figural \\"tiki mugs\\" for exotic cocktails, the most common of which depicts \\"Hotei,\\" a chubby buddha-like figure with arms raised in the air, have become collectible. Aoki died in 2008 at the age of 69. In 2009, Richard C. Stockinger became chief executive to replace Joel A.

On February 5, 2014, the Board of Directors of Benihana Inc. named Steve Shlemon the company's new President and Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, Benihana Inc. named Thomas J.

Lawsuits Benihana in Beaverton, Oregon In Benihana of Tokyo, Inc. v. Benihana, Inc.,Benihana of Tokyo, Inc. v. Benihana, Inc., 906 A.2d 114 (2006) financial issues and a change of corporate control led three of the members of the Benihana, Inc.'s board of directors to consider the issuance of convertible stock and its sale to a potential buyer. Eventually, the entire board approved resolutions ratifying a stock purchase agreement with the buyer and authorizing the stock issuance. Afterwards, the company filed an action against almost all of Benihana, Inc.'s directors, alleging breaches of fiduciary duties. On January 30, 2011, Benihana (Kuwait) filed a defamation lawsuit against a blogger for writing about his experience on his website. Las Palmas, the company that owns Benihana in Kuwait, took legal action against the reviewer for his \\"negative\\" attitudes towards the restaurant and for recording the videos without permission. The company alleged that the blogger worked for an advertising company and might have personal motives that could be linked to his work to denigrate Benihana and praise its competitors located in the same area.

Background to the Statutes Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence (1338‚Äì68), principal author of the Statutes of Kilkenny By the middle decades of the 14th century, the Hiberno-Norman presence in Ireland was perceived to be under threat, mostly due to the dissolution of English laws and customs among English settlers. These English settlers were described as \\"more Irish than the Irish themselves\\", referring to their taking up Irish law, custom, costume and language. The introduction to the text of the statutes claim,Statutes, pp.4‚Äì7 > Original Anglo-Norman: ... ore plusors Engleis de la dit terre guepissant la > lang gis monture leys & usages Engleis vivent et se governement as maniers > guise et lang des Irrois enemies et auxiant ount fait divers mariages & > aliaunces enter eux et les Irrois enemyes avauntditz dont le dit terre et le > lieg people de icelle la lang Engloies ligeance a nostre seignour le Roy Duc > et lez leis Engleis illoeques sont mis en subjection et retrets... ... now > many English of the said land, forsaking the English language, manners, mode > of riding, laws and usages, live and govern themselves according to the > manners, fashion, and language of the Irish enemies; and also have made > divers marriages and alliances between themselves and the Irish enemies > aforesaid; whereby the said land, and the liege people thereof, the English > language, the allegiance due to our lord the king, and the English laws > there, are put in subjection and decayed... The statutes tried to prevent this \\"middle nation\\", which was neither true English nor Irish,Muldoon, p.86 by reasserting English culture among the English settlers. There were also military threats to the Norman presence, such as the failed invasion by Robert Bruce's brother Edward Bruce in 1315, which was defended by the Irish chief Domhnall √ì N√©ill in his Remonstrance to Pope John XXII, complaining that \\"For the English inhabiting our land ... are so different in character from the English of England ... that with the greatest propriety they may be called a nation not of middle medium, but of utmost, perfidy\\".Remonstrance, p.42 Further, there was the de Burgh or Burke Civil War of 1333‚Äì38, which led to the disintegration of the estate of the Earldom of Ulster into three separate lordships, two of which were in outright rebellion against the crown.http://what-when-how.com/medieval-ireland/ulster- earldom-of-medieval-ireland/ The prime author of the statutes was Lionel of Antwerp, better known as the Duke of Clarence, and who was also the Earl of Ulster. In 1361, he had been sent as viceroy to Ireland by Edward III to recover his own lands in Ulster if possible and to turn back the advancing tide of the Irish.Fry, p.92 The statutes were enacted by a parliament that he summoned in 1366. The following year, he left Ireland. Many of the \\"statutes\\" (or \\"chapters\\") of the 1366 parliament repeated \\"ordinances\\" made by a great council held in 1351, also in Kilkenny. Legislation The statutes begin by recognising that the English settlers had been influenced by Irish culture and customs, as quoted above. They forbade the intermarriage between the native Irish and the native English, the English fostering of Irish children, the English adoption of Irish children and use of Irish names and dress.Simms, p.191 Those English colonists who did not know how to speak English were required to learn the language (on pain of losing their land and belongings), along with many other English customs. The Irish pastimes of \\"horlings\\" and \\"coiting\\" were to be dropped and pursuits such as archery and lancing to be taken up, so that the English colonists would be more able to defend against Irish aggression, using English military tactics.Statutes, VI, p.23 Other statutes required that the English in Ireland be governed by English common law, instead of the Irish March law or Brehon lawStatutes, IV, p.17 and ensured the separation of the Irish and English churches by requiring that \\"no Irishman of the nations of the Irish be admitted into any cathedral or collegiate church ... amongst the English of the land\\".Statutes, XIII, p.47 The mistrust the English had of the Irish is demonstrated by Statute XV, which forbade Irish minstrels or storytellers to come to English areas, guarding against \\"the Irish agents who come amongst the English, spy out the secrets, plans, and policies of the English, whereby great evils have often resulted\\".Statutes, XV, p.55 Failure of the Statutes While the Statutes were sweeping in scope and aim, the English never had the resources to fully implement them.Fry, p.94 Clarence was forced to leave Ireland the following year (and died the year after that), and Hiberno-Norman Ireland continued to gain a primarily Irish cultural identity. Only at the beginning of the 17th century would another attempt to colonise Ireland begin to make appreciable gains. The Statutes of Kilkenny ultimately helped to create the complete estrangement of the two \\"races\\" in Ireland for almost three centuries.\\"The Statutes of Kilkenny\\", p.792 See also *Norman Ireland *Tudor conquest of Ireland *Poynings' Law (disambiguation) ReferencesCitations=Sources= ;Primary: * * ;Secondary:  * * Simms, Katherine. \\"Gaelicization\\", Medieval Ireland: An Encyclopedia, 1st ed.

For the musician see Tony Garnier (musician) Tony Garnier (August 13, 1869 in Lyon - January 19, 1948 in Roquefort-la- B√©doule, France) was a noted architect and city planner. He was most active in his hometown of Lyon. Garnier is considered the forerunner of 20th century French architects. Biography After learning painting and drafting at the √âcole Technique de la Martini√®re in Lyon (1883-86), Garnier studied architecture at the √âcole nationale des beaux-arts de Lyon (1886-89) and the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris (1890-99). In 1899 he won the Prix de Rome for a design of a national bank. The prize enabled him to reside at the Villa Medici in Rome for four years, until 1904. During his stay in Rome he began working on the project of an industrial city that became his main contribution to town planning. In 1901, after extensive study of sociological and architectural problems, he began to formulate an elaborate solution to the perceived issues concerning urban design. His basic idea included the separation of spaces by function through zoning into several categories: industrial, civic, residential, health related, and entertainment. Garnier's drawings for an ideal industrial city called Une cit√© industrielle were initially exhibited in 1904, but only published later in 1918. Une Cit√© Industrielle was designed as an utopian form of living, for 35,000 inhabitants. It was located between a mountain and a river to facilitate access to hydroelectric power. This plan was highly influenced by the writings of √âmile Zola, in particular his socialist utopian novel Travail (1901). The plan allowed schools and vocational-type schools to be near the industries they were related to, so that people could be more easily educated. There were no churches or law enforcement buildings, in hope that man could rule himself. The idea of functional separation was later taken up by the members of CIAM, and would ultimately influence the design of cities like Brasilia. In 1904 Garnier returned to Lyon, where he received a commission for a livestock market and slaughterhouse (1906-24), later named Halle Tony Garnier. In 1910 he was commissioned for the design of the √âdouard-H√©rriot Hospital, completed in 1927. Further projects included several villas, the Stade de Gerland (Gerland stadium) (1914-18) and the low-cost housing Quartier des Etats-Unis (1919-35) on United-States avenue in the 8th arrondissement of Lyon. Grave of Tony Garnier In the 1920s Garnier continued the work on several major projects started before the war. In 1939 he moved from Lyon to Roquefort-la-B√©doule, where he died in 1948. He is buried in the Croix-Rousse cemetery.

They are spider- like, multi-legged combat vehicles, and are equipped with adaptive artificial intelligence. The spider design appears in other places in Shirow's work such as the Appleseed manga. Shirow is noted to keep numerous spiders as pets.Short biography included in the Ghost in the Shell manga published by Dark Horse Comics, p 349. Production I.G was unable to use the Fuchikoma design in the 2002 Stand Alone Complex anime television series due to copyright conflicts. However, Masamune Shirow was able to design a legally safe equivalent to the spider-tanks for the new show, which he named the \\"Tachikoma\\". There are distinct differences in the design, most significantly in the eye-equivalents and the vertically oriented abdomen. Still, the tanks are easily recognizable as descendants of the original Fuchikoma. Their AI personalities and roles in the SAC series are indistinguishable from their predecessors in the manga. Design A 3D model of a Tachikoma unit. Throughout the Stand Alone Complex animated series, Tachikoma characters were rendered by 3D software using a shader that mimics hand-drawn art. This method simplified the task of animating detailed robotic characters. The right-most image is a wire frame of the 3D model; the middle image is the Tachikoma model rendered with generic materials and lighting; the left-most image is the character as it appears in the series. Tachikoma are as large as an average sedan, are painted blue and have four \\"eyes\\" fitted on the surface of their bodies. Three are on the \\"head\\" and one is beneath the abdomen. Each eye has three pinholes, loosely resembling a bowling ball. These eyes sometimes become expressive in the typical anime style. Tachikoma are controlled by individual AIs, are capable of speech and generally exhibit a childish, curious, joyful and active personality, although they are consummate professionals in the field. They normally operate as independent unitsFrom Bandai Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex Limited Edition Pamphlet. and receive orders from human agents, but they can also be directly piloted from a cockpit in their abdomen.Stand Alone Complex Visual Book, Page 28. The Tachikoma's design is implicitly based on that of the jumping spider in terms of bio-mechanical modelling, and system technical design was based on the Fuchikoma.Official Log, page 104. Tachikoma have two arms and four legs. They can move by walking, or they can drive at high speed by using the wheeled footpads on each of their four legs. Each wheel appears to be angled and omnidirectional, allowing the Tachikomas to move in any direction with their drive system, which can control all degrees of freedom in its task space. Other abilities of the Tachikoma include jumping great distances, sticking to vertical or inverted surfaces, engaging a thermoptic camouflage mechanism, and grappling/rappelling using their adhesive string launchers. Tachikoma maintain control of their legs while using wheels to drive down a road, and shift their weight around turns. They can also roll briefly on to two legs while driving to avoid an obstacle or pass through a narrow space. To make balance easier, they can move their heavy abdomens with a ball joint. Standard Tachikoma equipment includes a 7.62√ó51mm light machine gun mounted in the right arm, a secondary weapon hardpoint in the \\"snout\\" (a 50 mm grenade launcher, capable of launching both explosive and gas grenades which can be replaced by a six-barrelled 12.7√ó99mm Gatling gun), a universal cybernetic connector on an extensible, prehensile cable in the left arm, liquid wires that can be used for grappling, rappelling or for restraining purposes and a built-in thermoptic camouflage system.Stand Alone Complex Visual Book, Page 29. Description Though they possess individual artificial intelligence, every night they are synchronized, so they start the next day with identical consciousnesses that are each the sum of their total collective experience and development. This leads to identity confusion, since each Tachikoma has the same memories. Though the Tachikoma have identical memories, their personalities and opinions are distinct. It is explained in the last episode of the first season that it is their curiosity that lets them be different from each other. These individual personalities are distinct among Tachikoma. One considers itself Batou's personal Tachikoma, which has a personality of a hyperactive child. It is special, given that Batou pampers it with natural oil and refuses to operate any other while on assignments. The second Tachikoma is more logical, acting as the straight man to the first. The third Tachikoma appears somewhat slower than the others, and at times has difficulty keeping up with the other Tachikomas when discussing such in-depth topics as what it means to be \\"alive\\". There is also a fourth Tachikoma with a distinctive personality, who is a bookworm and an intellectual. Its body was taken apart during the experimentation incident, but its AI has presumably been saved for further analysis. During finale of the first S.A.C. season, while all but three of the Tachikomas are either locked away in a lab or dismantled for study, three surviving Tachikoma units abandon their civilian posts to assist the Major and Batou. Dr. Asuda is the government researcher who single-handedly developed the neurochip used in the Tachikomas' AI and is considered by the Tachikomas to be their father. In the episode \\"Afternoon of the Machines ‚Äì PAT,\\" Asuda tries unsuccessfully to defect from Japan, because as a state-funded scientist, he is not allowed to hold patents on his inventions. Following his re-capture, the Tachikoma who is with The Major and Batou asks whether Dr. Asuda is its father. Desiring to leave a record of his achievement, Asuda inserted a trace of himself in the Tachikomas' memory during their reconstruction post-season 1. To prevent another collapse in the AI structural integrity, he decided to delete this last bit of sentimentality. AppearancesStand Alone Complex= In episode 12 of the Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, one slightly malfunctioning Tachikoma goes on a joy-ride through the city, where it meets a young girl named Miki who is looking for a lost dog. The episode is mostly comedy but turns serious, with the Tachikoma attempting to understand sadness and death. In a later episode, the Tachikomas argue among themselves over which met Miki, since they all have the same memory. Yet when Batou calls for his Tachikoma only his actual Tachikoma raised its hand. As it leaves with Batou, it suddenly remarks with quiet surprise that it indeed must have been the one that met Miki. Batou has the most affection for the tanks, picking out one tank as his \\"personal unit\\" and spoiling it with natural oil instead of synthetic. This is what causes his to go haywire later, when the natural oil dissolves some of the proteins in the Tachikoma's AI neurochip. On the other hand, Togusa, the least cyberized of the Section 9 staff, holds a less idealist view: \\"they're just machines.\\" Aside from leading to an indignant outburst from the Tachikomas (who accuse Togusa of bigotry), it sets up something of an antagonistic relationship between Togusa and the tanks, which is revisited in an episode in season two. Major Motoko Kusanagi holds the most pragmatic view of all. Her only regret following the Tachikomas' suicide attack is that she didn't get a chance to dive their AI, and discover whether or not what they had acquired was really a \\"ghost\\". In the manga, she expresses concern over the evolution of the Tachikomas' AI and orders it monitored to catch any undesired emotional developments or an unwanted \\"rise of the robots.\\" By the end of the series, the Tachikoma fleet start approaching sapience; all are sent back to the lab for dissection, amidst fears that they are no longer fit for combat duty. It is the use of natural oil in Batou's personal Tachikoma (all other units used synthetic lubricant) that acted as a catalyst for the behavioral anomalies that began to manifest as sapience. Major Kusanagi subsequently bans the use of natural oil prior to the later decision to halt deployment of Tachikomas in field ops. Three Tachikoma survive the mandatory decommissioning, (one blue, calling itself \\"Batou's Personal Tachikoma\\", and two others, repainted yellow and silver) and prove their worth when they abandon their new civilian jobs to save their imperiled comrades, without explicit orders to do so. The silver Tachikoma is destroyed on sight after it rescues Batou from attack by an Armed Suit, a bipedal power-actuated armored exoskeleton. The blue and yellow Tachikoma combine their efforts to save him, and conduct a desperate and ultimately suicidal attack against the Umibozu, while Batou watches from a nearby terrace with a stricken look on his face. This selfless act is the last thing they ever do. Those sent to the lab for structural analysis were restored from backups, their AI given a slew of upgrades and loaded into a new fleet, which appears in the second season. =S.A.C. 2nd GIG= In the second season, S.A.C. 2nd GIG, the enforced synchronizations among Tachikomas are limited to essential data only. Motoko Kusanagi allows them to maintain their own personality after the events in the first season. They can still share information and sensation via synchronization should they choose to. The Tachikomas are also outfitted to perform complex networking tasks including net-diving to aid Section 9. Several episodes featured the Tachikomas operating in the net using a representational avatar, instead of their map symbol of a triangle in a circle. It is indicated that while operating within the net, they could not inhabit their physical units. It is hinted that Tachikoma units developed ghosts. During the finale of 2nd GIG, while ordered to create a repository in cyberspace for the memories (and hopefully, ghosts) of all refugees of Dejima, they secured instead their own memories within the netspace and sacrificed their AI satellite to prevent a nuclear explosion. A fellow AI, the bioroid Proto, saw this and announced to the viewers that Tachikomas do indeed have ghosts. =Solid State Society= During the early portion of the film Solid State Society, the Uchikomas are seen being used by Section 9 in a way similar to the way the un-learned Tachikomas had been used. It was revealed that the engineers at Section 9 failed to reproduce the phenomenon whereby the AI develops an advanced state of self-awareness. However, the reappearance of the Major also brings the return of the Tachikomas. Initially they are seen in their cyberspace avatar forms, sporting different decals and individual names such as Max, Musashi, Loki, and Conan (names directly lifted from the Major's AI partners in the Man-Machine Interface manga). Eventually they are reintroduced to physical bodies, and rejoin Section 9 as full members. =Tachikomatic Days= , also known as Tachikoma Specials or Tachikoma Days, are a series of shorts attached to the end of every episode of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. Each short takes features the antics of the Tachikoma think tanks of Section 9 and involves plot points from the episodes. Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. 2nd GIG also has Tachikomatic Days at the end of each episode and most of the DVD and iTunes releases of both series. Tachikomatic Days did not air on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim broadcast of Stand Alone Complex and 2nd GIG. However, they are shown on Adult Swim's free webcast programming service Adult Swim Video. On Australia's Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, the Tachikomatic Days shorts are broadcast with each episode. The UK's AnimeCentral broadcasts Tachikoma Days with each episode. Merchandise Numerous Tachikoma merchandise items have been released by various companies, including a 1/24-scale plastic model kit released by Wave in December 2005, and a 1/35-scale model produced by Kotobukiya in 2014.

The 47th Disney animated feature film, it was released in standard and Disney Digital 3-D versions. The film is loosely based on characters from the 1990 children's book A Day with Wilbur Robinson, by William Joyce. The voice cast includes Jordan Fry, Wesley Singerman, Harland Williams, Tom Kenny, Steve Anderson, Laurie Metcalf, Adam West, Tom Selleck, and Angela Bassett. It was the first film released after then-Pixar executive John Lasseter became chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios. Plot Lewis is an aspiring 12-year-old inventor who grew up in an orphanage, whose inventions have been scaring off potential parents. He works all night on a machine to scan his memory to locate his birth mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage when he was a baby. While taking the scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it has been sabotaged by the Bowler Hat Guy and falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, however Lewis realizing that he can simply use the time machine to see his mother instead has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis does not stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinson family except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Having followed Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris try to kidnap him, but the Robinsons beat them back. The Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he is from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust. Lewis then discovers that Cornelius Robinson is, in fact, a future version of himself, and Wilbur is his future son. Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael \\"Goob\\" Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis' work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during an important Little League game and failed to make an important catch that cost the game. Goob became so bitter as a result that he was never adopted and remained in the orphanage long after it closed. Doris is \\"DOR-15\\", one of Lewis' failed and abandoned inventions. They both blamed Lewis for their misfortunes and decided to ruin his career by stealing the memory scanner and claiming credit for it. Leaving Lewis behind, they take off with the scanner, drastically altering the future to a world where Doris' clones have enslaved humanity. Lewis repairs the second time machine, confronts Doris and destroys her by promising to never invent her, restoring the future to its Utopian self. After persuasion from Lewis, Wilbur tries to ask the adult Goob to join the family, but he has disappeared, apparently ashamed by what he has done. Back in Wilbur's time, Lewis finally meets Cornelius face to face. Cornelius explains how the memory scanner started their successful career, and persuades Lewis to return to the science fair. Wilbur takes Lewis back, but makes one stop first: as he promised, he takes Lewis back to the moment when his mother abandoned him. Though Lewis approaches his mother, he ultimately decides not to interact with her, realizing the family he will come to have with Wilbur and others. Wilbur drops Lewis off in his own time and leaves. Lewis heads to the fair, but en route wakes up Goob just in time for him to make the winning catch. Back at the fair, Lewis asks for one more chance to demonstrate his scanner, which this time succeeds. He is adopted by Lucille, one of the science fair judges, and her husband Bud, who nicknames him \\"Cornelius\\" and takes him home. The film ends with a quote which reiterates the message of not dwelling on failures and \\"keep moving forward\\", attributed to Walt Disney.

Production Director Stephen J. Anderson at the film's premiere Originally titled A Day with Wilbur Robinson, production began in June 2004, and was scheduled for a 2006 release. During the film's production, Disney animator Stephen Anderson decided to direct the film due to his personal connection to Lewis, since they both grew up adopted. The studio planned to adapt Joyce's style to the film, but due to his involvement stylistically in Robots, the style was slightly reworked. While still taking cues from his retro style, influenced by everything from Technicolor movies to '40s architectural design, the crew also took inspiration from the company Apple. Unlike their previous film Chicken Little, a film starring CG animals, the animation crew had the challenge to animated CG humans. They took inspiration from The Incredibles when animating the characters. They also took inspiration from Disney animated classics, such as Alice in Wonderland, Cinderella, and Peter Pan, and from Warner Brothers cartoons to capture the 1950s aesthetic. While the film was in production, Disney announced on January 24, 2006 that it would be acquiring Pixar, and as a result, John Lasseter became the chief creative officer of both Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios. When he saw an early screening for the movie, he told Anderson that he did not find the villain scary or threatening enough, and suggested that he make some changes. Ten months later, almost 60% of the film had been scrapped and redone. The villain had improved and was given a new sidekick, a dinosaur chase had been added, and the ending was changed. Release Over 600 REAL D Cinema digital 3D-equipped theaters presented Disney Digital 3-D version of the film. The 3D version was preceded by the 1953 Chip 'n Dale 3D short Working for Peanuts. The final credits of the 3D version were left two-dimensional, except for the names of those who converted the film to 3D. =Home media= The DVD and Blu-ray versions were both released on October 23, 2007. Both versions feature 1.78 widescreen aspect ratio and Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, plus music videos, the \\"Family Function 5000\\" game, deleted scenes, and other bonus features. The DVD's audio commentary contains Anderson's narration, occasionally interrupted by himself as the Bowler Hat Guy. The Blu-ray also includes uncompressed 5.1 audio and a BD-J game, Bowler Hat Barrage!. A 3D Blu-ray was released on November 8, 2011. As of January 2008, the DVD had sold approximately 4 million copies. ReceptionCritical reception= The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 67% of critics gave the film positive reviews based on 141 reviews, with an average rating of 6.34/10. The site's critics consensus states, \\"Meet the Robinsons is a visually impressive children's animated film marked by a story of considerable depth.\\" Metacritic reported the film had a weighted average score of 61 out of 100 based on 27 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Realmovienews stated that it has \\"a snappy plot that demands close attention as it whizzes back and forth in the space-time continuum, touching on serious ideas and proposing some rather disturbing alternate realities. And the witty story twists are handled with rare subtlety and intelligence. In the end it may get a little weepy and inspirational. But it's so charming that we don't mind at all\\". Danny Minton of the Beaumont Journal said that \\"The Robinsons might not be a family you want to hang out with, but they sure were fun to meet in this imaginative and beautiful 3-D experience\\". Andrew L. Urban of Australian Urban Cinefile said that \\"Walt Disney stood for fantasy on screen and this is a loving tribute to his legacy\\". Kyle Smith of the New York Post named it the 10th best film of 2007. Conversely, A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote: \\"Meet the Robinsons is surely one of the worst theatrically released animated features issued under the Disney label in quite some time\\", while Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C\\" and said \\"This is one bumpy ride\\". =Box office= The film grossed $25,123,781 on its opening weekend, falling behind Blades of Glory. Over its theatrical run, it grossed $97,822,171 in the United States and Canada and $71,510,863 in other territories, totaling $169,333,034 worldwide.

It is the 48th Disney animated feature film. Directed by Chris Williams and Byron Howard, the film stars the voices of John Travolta, Miley Cyrus, Malcolm McDowell, Diedrich Bader, Nick Swardson, Greg Germann, Susie Essman and Mark Walton. The film's plot centers on a white dog named Bolt who, having spent his entire life on the set of a television series, thinks that he has super powers. When he believes that his human owner, Penny, has been kidnapped, he sets out on a cross-country journey to \\"rescue\\" her. Bolt was released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Despite a relatively marginal box-office performance, the film received a strong positive critical reception and is renowned for playing an important role in instigating what is widely referred to as the Disney Revival, as well as setting the studio in a new creative direction that would lead to other critically acclaimed features such as Tangled (2010) and Frozen (2013). Bolt was also Disney Animation's first feature film to be produced under the complete creative guidance of then-Pixar executive John Lasseter in his role as chief creative officer for the studio, as well as the first computer-animated feature film to implement non- photorealistic rendering. This was one of the final film roles for James Lipton before his death on March 2, 2020, the other being Igor, which was released the same year. The film was nominated for a series of awards, such as the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Plot A White Shepherd puppy named Bolt is adopted by an eight-year-old girl named Penny. Five years later, Bolt and Penny star in a hit television series called Bolt, in which Bolt uses various superpowers to protect Penny from the villain. To gain a more realistic performance, the show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes everything in the show is real and that he really has superpowers, including a devastatingly powerful sonic scream-like \\"superbark\\". After a cliffhanger episode causes Bolt to believe Penny has been kidnapped, he escapes from his on-set trailer in Hollywood but knocks himself unconscious in the process and is trapped inside a box of foam peanuts which is shipped to New York City. In New York, Bolt resumes his search for Penny and, much to his dismay and confusion, finds out the hard way that his \\"superpowers\\" are useless. He encounters Mittens, a feral cat who bullies pigeons out of their food. Bolt compels Mittens to guide him back to Penny ‚Äî Mittens being convinced her captor is a lunatic ‚Äî and the two start their journey westward by truck. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Penny is distraught over Bolt's disappearance but is convinced by the studio to continue filming with a less experienced lookalike dog. Surprised at his first feelings of hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute but needy dog, obtaining food for them both at an RV park. They are joined by Rhino, a fearless hamster and fanatical Bolt fan. Rhino's unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog's illusions about himself, but allows Mittens to figure out Bolt is from a television show. She tries to tell Bolt this, but Bolt simply becomes frustrated. Attempting to \\"superbark\\" her repeatedly, the noise draws the attention of an Animal Control patrol and Bolt and Mittens are both captured and taken to an animal shelter. Bolt, freed from the patrol van by Rhino, finally realizes and accepts that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) exhorts him to heroism. They rescue Mittens from the shelter, and as they continue west, Bolt and Mittens form a close friendship in which she teaches Bolt how to be an ordinary dog and enjoy typical dog activities. Mittens makes plans for the three of them to stay in Las Vegas, but hearing Bolt is still drawn to find Penny, she tells him Penny is only an actor, and humans never truly love their pets, and eventually betray and abandon them, as happened to her. Bolt refuses to believe her and continues on alone to Hollywood; with Rhino's encouragement his two friends follow shortly after. Bolt reaches the studio and finds Penny embracing his lookalike, unaware that Penny still misses him and her affection for the lookalike is only a part of a rehearsal. A broken-hearted Bolt leaves, but Mittens, on a gantry in the studio, sees Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt lookalike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some flaming torches, setting the sound stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives and the two reunite inside the burning studio, but are unable to escape before Penny begins to suffocate from the smoke. Penny begs Bolt to go but Bolt refuses to leave her. Bolt uses his \\"superbark\\" through the building's air vent, alerting the firefighters to their location and allowing both of them to be rescued in time. Penny and her mother quit when their overeager agent proposes they exploit the incident for publicity purposes. The show continues with a replacement \\"Bolt\\" and \\"Penny\\" and a new storyline involving alien abduction. Penny adopts Mittens and Rhino, and she and her family move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler, happy lifestyle with Bolt and her new pets.

Eventually, Sanders was removed from the project and replaced by Chris Williams and Byron Howard. The film's previous plot told the story of a dog named Henry, a famous TV star, who one day finds himself stranded in the Nevada desert with a testy, one-eyed cat and an oversized, radioactive rabbit who are themselves searching for new homes, all the while believing he is still on television. In 2006, after becoming Chief Creative Officer at Disney Animation, John Lasseter along with other directors from Pixar and Disney attended two screenings of the film and gave Sanders notes on how to improve the story. According to Lasseter, Sanders was replaced because he resisted the changes that Lasseter and the other directors had suggested. Lasseter was quoted as saying \\"Chris Sanders is extremely talented, but he couldn't take it to the place it had to be.\\" After Sanders left and the original title was removed, the animation team was told to complete the filming in 18 months instead of the usual four years that is normally required to produce a computer-animated feature. On June 8, 2007, Disney announced that the film, now under its current name, would be released on November 21, 2008 in Disney Digital 3-D. =Animation= The look of the film was inspired by the paintings of Edward Hopper and the cinematography of Vilmos Zsigmond. New technology in non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) was used to give it a special visual appearance, a technique later used in Tangled (2010). To give the film's 3D backgrounds a hand-painted look, the company artists used new patented technology designed specifically for the film. Bolt's characteristics are based on an amalgam of breeds, although the designers started with the American White Shepherd. Joe Moshier, lead character designer, said, \\"they American White Shepherds have really long ears, a trait that I tried to caricature in order to allow the animators to emphasize Bolt's expressiveness.\\" The design of Rhino in his plastic ball was based on executive producer John Lasseter's pet chinchilla, which was brought to an animators' retreat during the film's production. Music The score to Bolt was composed by John Powell. The soundtrack featured the film's score and two original songs ‚Äì \\"I Thought I Lost You\\" by Bolts stars Miley Cyrus and John Travolta (nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song on 2009) as well as \\"Barking at the Moon\\" by Rilo Kiley singer Jenny Lewis. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2008. Although Mot√∂rhead has a song in the film, they do not seem to appear in either the soundtrack or the score. Mot√∂rhead's song \\"Dog-Face Boy\\" (from their Sacrifice album) is in a mailroom scene where a young worker is listening to it on his headphones and inadvertently wraps Bolt up in a box that gets shipped off to New York City. Track listing: Release Bolt was theatrically released in the United States on November 21, 2008. Beginning in its fourth week in theaters, the film was accompanied by Pixar's Cars Toons short Tokyo Mater. =Home media= Bolt was released on Region A Blu-ray Disc in the United States on March 22, 2009. The BD set included standard DVD and digital copy versions of the film. Single- disc DVD and Special Edition DVD with Digital Copy versions followed in Region 1 on March 24.

The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Bolt is a pleasant animated comedy that overcomes the story's familiarity with strong visuals and likable characters.\\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a 67/100 approval rating based on 29 reviews following under the category \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Perry Seibert of TV Guide gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote the film \\"amuses both those who make up the film's target audience and the parents along for the ride. This winning mix of exciting action, heart-tugging sentiment, and gentle character comedy makes Bolt yet another solid addition to Disney's history of family-friendly fare.\\" Tasha Robinson of The A.V. Club gave the film a B+ stating that \\"Bolt is the studio's first film since Lilo & Stitch that feels like it's trying to recapture the old Disney instead of aggressively shedding it in favor of something slick and new. And yet it comes with a healthy cutting-edge Pixar flavor as well.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"[Bolt] also has an intriguing plot that is kind of the family animation version of the Jim Carrey-starring The Truman Show.\\" =Box office= On its opening weekend, the film opened number 3 with $26.2 million behind Twilight and Quantum of Solace. On its second weekend, it rose to No. 2 behind Four Christmases with a 1.4% increase. In the United States and Canada, the film grossed $114.1 million by its closing date on February 22, 2009.

Life and career Born in Frascineto to Emanuele Bilotta and Francesca Martire,http://egiordano0.tripod.com/14.html he studied in San Demetrio Corone and was ordained as a Byzantine rite priest in 1866. Interested in pedagogy and in classical and modern literatures and languages, he graduated as a school teacher and taught in elementary schools in Frascineto. His commitment to the study and the preservation of the Arb√´resh√´ language brought him to take part in some Arb√´resh√´ linguistic congresses, notably to a congress held in Corigliano Calabro in 1895 and another congress held in Lungro in 1897. As far as his poetical and writing career is concerned, Bilotta started composing in 1870 when he wrote Mercurio Dorsa. A few years later he began the epic poem La Spada di Skanderbeg a Dibre Inferiore, which he revised four times, from 1874 to 1890. Apart from his production of poems and poetry, he also wrote several philological works about the Albanian language, which he continued publishing until 1915.

His literary work marked the transition to modern Albanian literature in Italy. He was a major protagonist of the Rilindja, the Albanian cultural awakening or Albanian Renaissance, in Italy. Early life Schir√≤ was born in Piana dei Greci (now Piana degli Albanesi).Di Marco & Musco, Aspetti della cultura bizantina ed albanese in Sicilia, p. 85 While still young he was encouraged by his cousin Cristina Gentile Mandal√† (1856‚Äì1919) to value his native Arb√´resh√´ language and culture. She would assist him later in collecting local folktales and published a compilation of folktales herself. At the age of nine he wrote poem inspired by nationalism and dedicated to Albania's most important national hero Skanderbeg. In 1890, he graduated with a law degree at the University of Palermo. However, his main passion remained classical and Italian folklore and literature, which he taught in 1888‚Äì1894 at the Garibaldi secondary school in Palermo. At the university he befriended Luigi Pirandello, who would become a world-famous novelist and playwright. Literary career He wrote poems in both Italian and Albanian, and soon began to collaborate with literary and political writings in various periodicals. In 1887, he founded the magazine Arbri i rii (La giovine Albania/The young Albania), which was followed in 1890 with Archivio albanese (Albanian archive) and in 1904 with the short-lived La bandiera albanese (The Albanian flag).Enciclopedia Italiana (1936) at Treccani His literary breakthrough was Rapsodie albanesi (Albanian Rhapsodies) in 1887, which made him known to Albanologists and Albanian patriots. In 1891, he published an imaginary love idyll Mili e Haidhia (Mili and Haidhia), which would eventually be published in three editions (1900 and 1907), including notes on traditions, legends, customs and traditions of Piana dei Greci. The work is considered to be a masterpiece of early 20th century Albanian verse and is probably his best work. A collection of patriotic songs K√´nkat e luft√´s (The songs of battle), dedicated to Albanian independence, came out in Palermo in 1897, followed by the historical idyll Te dheu i huaj (To the foreign land) in 1900 about the epic escape of Albanians in the 15th century from their homeland and their arrival in Sicily. He also published work on Arb√´resh√´ folklore in Canti sacri delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia (Sacred Songs of the Albanian Colonies in Sicily) in 1907, and Canti tradizionali e altri saggi delle colonie albanesi di Sicilia (Traditional Songs and Other Essays of the Albanian colonies of Sicily) in 1923. Academic career and politics Schir√≤ was a major protagonist of the Rilindja, the Albanian cultural awakening or Albanian Renaissance, in Italy.Fracchia, Joseph (2010). \\"Hora\\": Social Conflicts and Collective Memories in Piana degli Albanesi. Past & Present, Volume 209, Issue 1, November 2010, Pages 181‚Äì222, https://doi.org/10.1093/pastj/gtq030 In October 1895, along with fellow Italo- Albanians Girolamo de Rada and Anselmo Lorecchio, he organised a congress on Albanian national, cultural and linguistic self-determination that convened in Corigliano Calabro and it was followed by a second congress in Lungro during February 1897. Schir√≤'s views on the Albanian question during the late Ottoman period were in support of revolution against the empire so as to take advantage of sympathy toward Albanians in the European press and influence European diplomacy toward supporting an uprising. For Schir√≤, the existence of the Ottoman Empire was on borrowed time and he was against Albanian-Ottoman cooperation to safeguard Albanian interests as for him it was counterproductive to achieving Albanian independence. In 1900 he was appointed professor of Albanian language and literature at the Istituto Regio Orientale (Royal Oriental Institute) in Naples, where he would remain until the end of his life. From 1912 to 1914 Schir√≤ worked in Albania as an inspector for Italian schools. Those were the years of the birth of an independent Albania, proclaimed in November 1912 after nearly 500 years of Ottoman rule. Meanwhile, he had laid the foundation of the Societ√† nazionale albanese (Albanian National Society) to affect public opinion in favour for the independence of Albania, and for the same purpose composed a poem Fiamuri i Arb√´rit (The Albanian flag) and the book \\"The Albanians and the Balkan question\\", both in 1904. While devotedly Albanian, Schir√≤ also admired Italy's cultural potential. He often advocated Italy's role, with its strong Arb√´resh√´ minority, as a protector of the weak Albanian state against the hostile intentions of its Balkan neighbours. In 1913, Schir√≤ participated in the Albanian Congress of Trieste for recognition of the political and economic independence of Albania. Schir√≤ was fascinated with the early Fascist movement of Benito Mussolini. In K√´nkat e litorit (The Songs of the Littoral), published in 1926, he glorified the rise of the movement. In local politics, he was an unyielding opponent of Nicola Barbato, the socialist leader of his hometown Piana dei Greci. He supported the local Mafia boss Francesco Cuccia for mayor in April 1922. Schir√≤ publicly defended the Mafia administration of Cuccia several times, considering it \\"the most suitable for the peaceful development of the best qualities of its people,\\" able to open \\"a new period in our history.\\" In a speech from the balcony of City Hall, he praised Cuccia to have had the merit and the courage \\"to have done away with that red flag of socialism from our community.\\" Il coraggio di Mariano Barbato , La Sicilia, 17 January 2010 Death and legacy Schir√≤ on a 2015 stamp of Albania The death of his son Mino, murdered in a political intrigue in July 1920, shed a heavy shadow over his final years. He dedicated the poem \\"Mino\\" to his son's death. Schir√≤ died on 17 February 1927 in Naples. His absolute belief in Italy as a potential protector and custodian of the culture of Albania conflicted with the aspirations of Albanian nationalists, which advocated absolute independence, including from Italy. Despite his accomplishments, Schir√≤ was less appreciated by literary historians in Communist Albania and political criteria interfered with objective literary criticism. Schir√≤ is considered to be one of the greatest figures of contemporary Sicilian Arb√´resh literature. According to the scholar in Albanian literature and folklore, Robert Elsie, Schir√≤ ‚Äúfirst succeeded in blending the romantic elements of Arb√´resh folk verse with the artistic precision of Italian classical and neo-classical poetry to form a harmonious and balanced poetic corpus. What Girolamo De Rada had done for Arb√´resh literature in the 19th century, Giuseppe Schir√≤ accomplished in the 20th.‚Äù ReferencesSources * Elsie, Robert (2005).

Moore also co-authored the lyrics for the \\"Ballad of the Green Berets\\", which was one of the major hit songs of 1966. The song was also featured in the 1968 film The Green Berets, based on Moore's book, which starred John Wayne. A new edition of The Green Berets was published in April 2007, and his last book, Wars of the Green Berets, co-authored with Col. Mike 'Doc' Lennon, was released in June 2007. At the time of his death, Moore was residing in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, home to Fort Campbell and the 5th Special Forces Group, where he was working on his memoirs and three other books. Early life and career Born in Boston, Moore was raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where he attended Middlesex School. He also attended Belmont Hill School. During World War II, he served as a nose gunner in the U.S. Army Air Corps, flying combat missions in the European Theater. For his service, he was awarded the Air Medal. Moore graduated from Harvard College in 1949, and one of his first jobs was working in television production and then at the Sheraton Hotel Company co-founded by his father, Robert Lowell Moore. While working in the hotel business in the Caribbean, he recorded the early days of Fidel Castro in the nonfiction book The Devil To Pay. Training with Special Forces Due to connections with Harvard classmate Robert F. Kennedy, Moore was allowed access to the U.S. Army Special Forces to write about this elite unit of the United States Army. General William P. Yarborough insisted that Moore go through special forces training to better understand \\"what makes Special Forces soldiers 'special'.\\" He trained for nearly a year, first at \\"jump school\\" for airborne training before completing the Special Forces Qualification Course or \\"Q course\\", becoming the first civilian to participate in such an intensive program. Afterwards, Moore was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group on deployment to Vietnam. His experiences in-country formed the basis for The Green Berets, a bestseller that helped secure him international acclaim (see United States Army Special Forces in popular culture). Later writings During the 1970s and '80s, Moore travelled widely, spending time in such places as Dubai, Iran, Rhodesia, and Russia. Having gathered the information needed, he wrote The Crippled Eagles (later published as The White Tribe) and The Moscow Connection. Due to political controversy, The Crippled Eagles was rejected by publishers and did not appear until the early 1990s. (Rumor has it that the printing was quietly but firmly discouraged by the U.S. State Department). He also wrote the nonfiction books Rhodesia and Major Mike (with U.S. Army Major Mike Williams). Moore travelled to Uzbekistan in December 2001 to research the CIA-Northern Alliance war against the Taliban and al-Qaeda, publishing the account in the bestseller The Hunt for Bin Laden. In 2003, continuing his interest in writing about the war on terror, Moore traveled to Iraq to research Operation Iraqi Freedom and the downfall of the Saddam Hussein regime for his book, Hunting Down Saddam. Before his death, he completed The Singleton: Target Cuba with Ret. USASF Major General Geoffrey Lambert, a novel about Fidel Castro and biological warfare. The Hunt For Bin Laden veracity Shortly after the publication of The Hunt for Bin Laden, the veracity of the book was disputed, particularly regarding the involvement of Jack Idema. Idema, who was one of Moore's major sources, provided what later proved to be fabricated accounts of his exploits. To portray himself as having a greater role in the operation, Idema apparently went as far as to rewrite much of Moore and Chris Thompson's text prior to publication under the direct authorization of Random House editor Bob Loomis. Special Forces soldiers who were on the mission (including those whom Moore interviewed) disputed Idema's claims. With Idema thus discredited, Moore eventually disavowed The Hunt for Bin Laden and the book remains out of print. Despite the unfortunate fate of the book, Moore continued to enjoy the respect of the Special Forces community. Other worksFilm= The Green Berets is a 1968 film based on Moore's 1965 book. Parts of the screenplay bear little relation to the novel, although the portion in which a woman seduces a Vietnamese communist leader and sets him up to be kidnapped by Americans is from the book. John Wayne requested and obtained full military co-operation and materiel from President Johnson. To please the Pentagon, which was attempting to prosecute Robin Moore for revealing classified information, Wayne bought Moore out for $35,000 and 5% of undefined profits of the film.Moore, Robin Introduction to 1999 edition The Green Berets The Green Berets: The Amazing Story of the U.S. Army's Elite Special Forces Unit 2007 Skyhorse Publishing Inc. =Other= * Creator of the comic strip Tales of the Green Beret and the book The Man with the Silver Oar * Co-screenwriter for the film Inchon about the Inchon landing during the Korean War * Co-founder of the Crippled Eagles club in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) for expatriate Americans serving with the Rhodesian Security Forces Honors At the 2007 5th Special Forces Group reunion banquet, Col. Chris Conner confirmed Moore as a lifelong member of 5th SFG. At the same banquet, Moore was made a Kentucky colonel. Death Robin Moore died in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, on February 21, 2008, after a long illness. Eulogies were given by Rudi Gresham, General Victor Hugo, Major General Thomas R. Csrnko, Alexander N. Rossolimo, and Moore's brother John. A Presidential citation was presented to Helen Moore by General Hugo. Full military honors were rendered immediately after the service. Major General Gary L.

A member of the Democratic Party, she served for one term (1993‚Äì1995) in the 103rd Congress. Early life and career Byrne grew up in Salt Lake City and attended both the University of Utah and Mount Vernon College in Ohio. After her family moved to Northern Virginia in 1971, she became active with several community organizations, including the Parent Teacher Association for her children's schools, the Fairfax Area League of Women Voters and the Fairfax County Commission on Fair Campaign Practices. In 1985, Byrne co-founded Quintech Associates, Inc., a human resources consulting firm. She served as president of Quintech until her election to Congress in 1992. Virginia House Byrne served in the Virginia House of Delegates for six years, having defeating two- term Republican incumbent Gwen Cody in 1985. In this role, she supported public/private partnerships for transportation, including the Dulles Greenway project. Tenure in Congress In 1992, Virginia was awarded an additional House seat as a result of the 1990 U.S. Census. Byrne ran for Congress that year in the newly created . When she won that race, she became the first woman elected to Congress from Virginia.

The History of Basque (1997) Routledge Jose M. de Barandiaran Mitologia Vasca (1996) Txertoa Controversy The existence of a Basque mythological figure, Urtzi, has been questioned in numerous discussions. The argument for Urtzi being a Basque sky god is based on two main arguments. The first main argument is that Basque has numerous calendric and meteorological terms which contain forms of the root ortzi (with the variants urtz, ortz, orz and ost), for example: *ortzadar 'rainbow' (ortzi + adar 'horn') *ortzi 'sky, thunder' *orzgorri (> oskorri) 'red sky' (ortzi + gorri 'red') *ostargi 'daylight' (ortzi + argi 'light') *ostegun 'Thursday' (ortzi + egun 'day') *oskarbi 'clear sky' (ortzi + garbi 'clean') This has led to a popular modern interpretation of Urtzi as a sky god. It should also be mentioned that the modern Basque word for sky, zeru, is a loanword from Latin caelum and that the word urtzi or ortzi is not productive anymore. The second argument is based on the 12th-century account, the Codex Calixtinus, of Aymeric Picaud, a French pilgrim, who recorded a number of Basque words and expressions. He wrote about Urtzi: et Deus uocant Urcia (\\"and they name God as Urcia\\".) Since the remaining material Picaud recorded appears to be very accurate, this bears some weight. However, there are no legends at all related to such a god and Picaud remains the only explicit reference to date. This had led to the alternative theory that this may have been a generic term for 'sky' and that Picaud may have simply \\"pointed at the sky\\" looking for the word for God and been supplied the word for 'sky.' This explanation is to some degree supported by the unexpected absolutive case ending -a in Urcia, which neither in Proto- Basque or modern Basque appears on proper nouns. To date neither theory has been able to convince fully. As a personal name With the modern resurgent interest in Basque names, Urtzi has been used as a male given name: *Urtzi Urrutikoetxea, Basque writer *Urtzi Iriondo, footballer ReferencesExternal links *Ortzi, entry in Au√±amendi Encyclopedia, by Jos√© Miguel de Barandiar√°n * Ortzi, entry in Au√±amendi Encyclopedia, by Jos√© Miguel de Barandiar√°n Category:Basque and Iberian deities Category:Sky and weather gods Category:Basque masculine given names Category:Supernatural beings identified with Christian saints ","title":"Urtzi"},{"id":"2017335","text":"Leslie Allen Jordan (born April 29, 1955) is an American actor and writer. He is best known for his roles as Lonnie Garr in Hearts Afire (1993‚Äì1995), Beverly Leslie in Will & Grace (2001‚Äì2006, 2017‚Äì2020), several characters in the American Horror Story franchise (2011‚Äìpresent), and Sid in The Cool Kids (2018‚Äì2019). One of his best-known onstage performances was in Sordid Lives, where he played Earl \\"Brother Boy\\" Ingram, a role he took to the big screen in the popular cult film of the same name.  Early life  Leslie Jordan was born and raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In a 2014 interview, Jordan said that he had a difficult time growing up Southern Baptist. \\"I was baptized 14 times. Every time the preacher would say, 'Come forward, sinners!' I'd say 'Oooh, I was out in the woods with that boy, I better go forward.'\\" Leslie has twin sisters Jana & Janet who are 22 months younger than Leslie. During an appearance on Today with Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford, Jordan discussed his personal life and career. He described his mother, Peggy Ann, as being supportive and accepting though never truly understanding him. When asked about his mother, he said she lives in Chattanooga and is a private woman. Jordan's father was a lieutenant colonel in the United States Army and died in a plane crash when Jordan was 11 years old. Jordan moved to Los Angeles in 1982 where he became involved with drugs and alcohol and was arrested several times. When Jordan was 27 years old, he began to journal daily, which helped him recover from drug and alcohol abuse. In 2010, Jordan told talk show host Wendy Williams that he had been sober for thirteen years. In the same appearance Jordan said that before he gave up drinking, he once shared a cell with Robert Downey Jr., and when they both appeared later on Ally McBeal, Downey couldn't quite place where they had met before. Early in the AIDS crisis, Jordan became involved in AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA) as a buddy and as a food delivery person for Project Angel Food.  Career  Jordan is recognized for his diminutive size and Southern drawl. He appeared as newspaper editor Mr. Blackly in the movie The Help. His television career includes guest appearances on Murphy Brown, Will & Grace, Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, Star Trek: Voyager, Caroline in the City, Pee- Wee's Playhouse, Reba, Boston Public, Boston Legal, Nash Bridges, American Horror Story and Hearts Afire. He guest-starred on the comedy-drama Ugly Betty as celebrity-trasher Quincy Combs. In 2007, Jordan starred as Jesse Joe in the short-lived CW television program Hidden Palms, and portrayed the ski patrol director in Ski Patrol in 1990. On the television series Will & Grace, Jordan played Karen's pretentious, sexually ambiguous rival Beverley Leslie for which he received an Emmy Award for Best Guest Actor in a Comedy Series at the 58th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006. His Emmy Award earned him an invitation to present the awards for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series at the 2006 Emmy Awards with Cloris Leachman a week later. Jordan starred in the pilot episode of Laugh Out, the world's first interactive, gay-themed comedy show. On August 18, 2014, Jordan became a housemate in the celebrity edition of the British reality game show Big Brother. He was the second person to leave the Big Brother house (August 29, 2014). In January 2015, Jordan guest starred in the British sitcom Benidorm for two episodes as the character \\"Buck-A-Roo\\". Jordan is an accomplished stage actor and playwright. In one of his best-known performances onstage, he played Earl \\"Brother Boy\\" Ingram in Sordid Lives, a role he took to the big screen in the popular cult film of the same name. Jordan reprised the role in the Sordid Lives: The Series, a televized spin-off of the movie airing on Logo where he plays a character that is in a mental hospital. He wrote and starred in the autobiographical play Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel, which was also made into a motion picture. In 2004, he toured the country performing his one-man stage comedy, Like a Dog on Linoleum, to generally favorable reviews. Jordan's first autobiographical stage show was called Hysterical Blindness and Other Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far, with music and lyrics by Joe Patrick Ward. The production, in which Jordan was backed by a gospel choir singing satirical songs about racism and homophobia, was produced off-Broadway at the SoHo Playhouse and ran for seven months. Next, he distilled his experiences growing up as an effeminate, tiny boy in the Southern United States and in show business into an autobiographical one-man show, My Trip Down the Pink Carpet. During the opening of My Trip Down the Pink Carpet, Jordan's microphone stopped working, but he kept on with the show like nothing happened, and his show was a success. After touring the nation for several months with the production, the show opened off-Broadway at the Midtown Theater on April 19, 2010. The show is produced by Jordan's friend, actress Lily Tomlin. Jordan announced on The Paul O'Grady Show that he will be bringing his show to London's Apollo Theatre. On November 1, 2017, Jordan appeared in the new British television drama Living the Dream produced jointly by Sky and Big Talk Productions but branded as a Sky Original Production. In the fall of 2018, Jordan starred in the Fox network sitcom The Cool Kids, along with Martin Mull, Vicki Lawrence and David Alan Grier. On April 2, 2020, it was announced Jordan will play the lead role of Phil in the Fox sitcom Call Me Kat, along with Mayim Bialik, Swoosie Kurtz, Kyla Pratt and Cheyenne Jackson. As of July 29, 2020, Jordan has 5 million Instagram followers. He celebrated his milestone of 1 million followers by making a video wearing sunglasses and a fancy little suit for his followers. His following grew substantially in response to his posts during the COVID-19 pandemic. https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2020/04/25/leslie-jordan-anderson- cooper-instagram-quarantine-ac360-sot-vpx.cnn  Personal life  Jordan is gay and lives in Los Angeles, California.https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/leslie-jordan- perfectly-loopy-quarantine-videos  Credits  Writer = * Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel (play) * My Trip Down the Pink Carpet (2008) * Hysterical Blindness and Other Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far = Stage = * Found a Peanut (1986) * Sordid Lives (1996) * Southern Baptist Sissies (2000) * Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel * Like a Dog on Linoleum (2004) * My Trip Down the Pink Carpet (2010) * Lucky Guy (2011), off-Broadway musical in the role of Big Al Wright  Filmography Film= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" !

Brown (2007), The Canonization of al-BukhƒÅrƒ´ and Muslim: The Formation and Function of the Sunnƒ´ ·∏§adƒ´th Canon, p.9. Brill Publishers. . Quote: \\"We can discern three strata of the Sunni hadith canon. The perennial core has been the Sahihayn. Beyond these two foundational classics, some fourth/tenth-century scholars refer to a four-book selection that adds the two Sunans of Abu Dawud (d. 275/889) and al-Nasa'i (d. 303/915). The Five Book canon, which is first noted in the sixth/twelfth century, incorporates the Jami' of al-Tirmidhi (d. 279/892). Finally the Six Book canon, which hails from the same period, adds either the Sunan of Ibn Majah (d. 273/887), the Sunan of al-Daraqutni (d. 385/995) or the Muwatta' of Malik b. Anas (d. 179/796). Later hadith compendia often included other collections as well.' None of these books, however, has enjoyed the esteem of al-Bukhari's and Muslim's works.\\" From his \\"As-Sunan al-Kubra (The Large Sunan)\\" he wrote an abridged version, \\"Al-Mujtaba\\" or Sunan al-Sughra (The Concise Sunan). Of the fifteen books he is known to have written, six treat the science of hadƒ´th.  Biography  Al-Nasa'i himself states he was born in the year 830 (215 h.) - although some say it was in 829 or 869 (214 or 255 h.) - in the city of Nasa in present-day Turkmenistan - part of Khorasan, a region in Western Asia known for its many centres of Islamic learning. There he attended the gatherings and circles of knowledge, known as \\"halqas\\". At about 15 years old, he began his travels with his first journey to Qutaibah. He covered the whole Arabian Peninsula seeking knowledge from scholars in Iraq, Kufa, the Hijaz, Syria and Egypt, where he eventually settled. = Martyrdom = According to Sunni sources, he was beaten or tortured to death by a mob upon refusal to praise Muawiyah ibn Abu Sufyan.http://www.abuaaliyah.com/2018/08/11/the-assassination-of-imam-an- nasai-and-his-bayyan/https://sunnah.com/nasai/about Abu Abdullah Al-Hafiz said:https://www.islamicfinder.org/knowledge/biography/story-of-imam-annasai/ ‚ÄúI heard Ali ibn Umar saying, ‚ÄòAbu Abd-ur-Rahman An-Nasai was the most knowledgeable among the Sheikhs (teachers) of Egypt in terms of Fiqh, and authenticity and narrators of Hadiths, during his time. Being the best among them, they felt envy towards him. Thus, he moved to Ar-Ramlah (a town in Palestine) where he was asked about Muawiyah ibn Abu Sufyan. He did not reply in a good thing, and thus people beat him badly. He asked to be moved to Makkah, in spite of his illness, where he passed away.‚Äù Abu Abdullah also said: ‚ÄúIn addition to his multiple merits, he was given martyrdom at the end of his life.‚Äù = Teachers = According to the hafiz Ibn Hajr Alaih, al- Nasa'i's teachers were too numerous to name, but included: * Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh * Imam Abu Daud Al-Sijistani (author of Sunan Abu Dawood) * Qutaibah ibn Saeed Hafiz ibn Hajr and others claimed that Imam Bukhari was among his teachers. However Al-Mizzi, refutes that the Imam ever met him. As-Sakhawi gives the reasons in great detail for al-Mizzi's claim that they never met, but argues these must apply also to his claim that An-Nasa'i heard from Abu Dawud. Moreover, Ibn Mundah narrates the following: We were informed by Hamzah, that an-Nasa'i, Abu Abd-ur-Rahman informed us saying, 'I heard Muhammad Ibn Isma'il Al-Bukhari...' Ibrahim ibn Ya'qub al-Juzajani was also an influence. In Egypt an-Nasa'i began to lecture, mostly narrating ahadith (hadith plural) to the extent that he became known by the title \\"Hafizul Hadeeth\\".

The term originated in 12th-century Europe. In the Massachusetts Bay Colony, a man had to be a member of the Church to be a freeman; in neighboring Plymouth Colony a man did not need to be a member of the Church, but he had to be elected to this privilege by the General Court. Being a freeman carried with it the right to vote, and in Plymouth only freemen could vote by 1632. Black's Law Dictionary (9th edition) defines Freeman as follows: 1\\\\. A person who possesses and enjoys all the civil and political rights belonging to the people under a free government. 2\\\\. A person who is not a slave. 3\\\\. Hist. A member of a municipal corporation (a city or a borough) who possesses full civic rights, esp. the right to vote. 4\\\\. Hist. A freeholder. Cf. VILLEIN. 5. Hist. An allodial landowner. Cf. VASSAL. - also written free man. \\"Freedom\\" was earned after an allotted time, or after the person demanding \\"payment\\" was satisfied. This was known as indentured servitude, and was not originally intended as a stigma or embarrassment for the person involved; many of the sons and daughters of the wealthy and famous of the time found themselves forced into such temporary servitude, Gary Nash reporting that \\"many of the servants were actually nephews, nieces, cousins and children of friends of emigrating Englishmen, who paid their passage in return for their labor once in America.\\"Gary Nash, The Urban Crucible: The Northern Seaports and the Origins of the American Revolution (1979) p 15 An indentured servant would sign a contract agreeing to serve for a specific number of years, typically five or seven. Many immigrants to the colonies came as indentured servants, with someone else paying their passage to the Colonies in return for a promise of service. At the end of his service, according to the contract, the indentured servant usually would be granted a sum of money, a new suit of clothes, land, or perhaps passage back to England. An indentured servant was not the same as an apprentice or a child who was \\"placed out.\\" Once a man was made a freeman and was no longer considered a common, he could become a member of the church (and would usually do so) and he could own land. The amount of land that he was able to own was sometimes determined by how many members there were in his family. As a freeman, he became a member of the governing body, which met in annual or semiannual meetings (town meetings) to make and enforce laws and pass judgment in civil and criminal matters. As the colonies grew, these meetings became impractical and a representative bicameral system was developed. Freemen would choose deputy governors who made up the upper house of the General Court, and assistant governors who made up the lower house, who chose the governor from among their ranks and passed judgments in civil and criminal matters. To hold one of these offices it was required, of course, for one to be a freeman. Thus, the enfranchised voters and office holders were landholding male church members. Non-Puritans were not made freeman. Progression to freeman Initially, a male was not formally considered free when first entering into a colony, or just recently having become a member of one of the local churches; he was considered common. Such persons were never forced to work for another individual, per se, but their movements were carefully observed, and if they veered from the Puritan ideal, they were asked to leave the colony. There was an unstated probationary period, usually one to two years, that the prospective \\"freeman\\" needed to go through, and he was allowed his freedom if he did pass this probationary period of time. A Freeman was said to be free of all debt, owing nothing to anyone except God Himself. Free planter A \\"free planter\\" (as opposed to a \\"freeman\\") was any land holder who possessed land outright that was usually given to him by the colony after he had finished his probationary period, except in those cases where the land owner had inherited his property. But if he was deemed legally incompetent, didn't pass his probationary period, or again lost his freedom through some irresponsibility of his own, he would have his land and property confiscated and redistributed among the remaining freemen, even if the inheritor was a well-respected citizen.James Savage, Winthrop's Journal 'The History of New England' 1630-1649(1825-26 edition) Oath of a freeman Initially, all persons seeking to be free needed to take the Oath of a Freeman, in which they vowed to defend the Commonwealth and not to conspire to overthrow the government. The first handwritten version of the \\"Freeman's Oath\\" was made in 1634; it was printed by Stephen Daye in 1639 in the form of a broadside or single sheet of paper intended for posting in public places.

Life and career Tinker was born in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Margaret (n√©e Hessin) and Arthur Almerin Tinker. During World War II, Tinker served in the United States Army Air Forces Reserve. He graduated from Dartmouth College. His sons, Mark and John, are also television producers. In 1961, Tinker rejoined NBC and was the head of West Coast programming, where he developed I Spy, Dr. Kildare, and The Man from U.N.C.L.E. Tinker married Moore in 1962. In 1969, they formed the television production company MTM Enterprises. Tinker hired Room 222 writers James L. Brooks and Allan Burns to create and produce the company's first television series, The Mary Tyler Moore Show. MTM produced such popular American sitcoms and drama television series as Rhoda, The Bob Newhart Show, WKRP in Cincinnati, Hill Street Blues, and St. Elsewhere. After his divorce from Moore in 1981, Tinker left MTM to become the chairman and CEO of NBC, then the perennial last-place American television network (in terms of Nielsen ratings and profits). During Tinker's tenure in NBC's top position, the network regained ratings and produced the popular shows The Cosby Show, Family Ties, The Golden Girls, Cheers, Night Court, and Hill Street Blues. Tinker left the network in 1986, shortly after its parent company RCA was bought by General Electric. After leaving NBC, Tinker tried to repeat his success with MTM by forming GTG (Grant Tinker-Gannett) Entertainment, but the business venture failed and the company closed in 1990.

This phenomenon is not only a consequence of lack of income, but is also the result of the deprivation of capabilities and gender biases present in both societies and governments. It covers the poverty of choices and opportunities such as the ability to lead a long, healthy, and creative life, and enjoying basic rights like freedom, respect, and dignity. The term \\"feminization of poverty\\" has been defined in many different ways focusing on income, assets, time, health deprivations, and social and cultural exclusions. History The concept of the 'feminization of poverty' dates back to the 1970s and became popular in the 1990s through some United Nations documents.United Nations. (1996). Resolution Adopted by the General Assembly on the report of the Second Committee (A/50/617/Add.6) ‚Äì Women in development. 9 February 1996, Fiftieth session, Agenda item 95 (f), General Assembly A/RES/50/104.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the Twenty-third Special Session of the General Assembly (A/S-23/10/Rev.1) ‚Äì Further actions and initiatives to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. A/RES/S-23/3, 16 November 2000, Twenty-third special session, Agenda item 10, 00-65205. New York: United Nations It became a prominent in popular society after a study focusing on gender patterns in the evolution of poverty rates in the United States was released. The feminization of poverty is a relative concept based on a women-men comparison. For instance, if poverty in a society is distinctly reduced among men and is only slightly reduced among women, there would be a feminization of poverty.  Definitions  There are many definitions on the feminization of poverty. One definition talks of a widening gap in the quality of life between women and men while another describes a gap between female-headed households and in male or couple-headed households. It likewise depicts the escalating role that gender discrimination has in determining poverty. For instance, an increase of wage discrimination between males and females also exacerbates poverty among women and men of all types of families. This can be understood as a feminization of poverty because it denotes the relation between the biases against women and a rise in poverty. In numerous cases, such changes in the causes of poverty will result in one of the types of the feminization of poverty, that is, the relative changes in the poverty levels of women and female-headed households. The concept also served to illustrate the many social and economic factors contributing to women's poverty, including the significant gender pay gap between women and men. The term originates in the US and the question posed is whether or not it is an international phenomenon. The proportion of female-headed households whose incomes fall below the \\"poverty line\\" has been broadly adopted as a measure of women's poverty. In many countries, household consumption and expenditure surveys show a high incidence of female-headed households among the \\"poor,\\" defined as those whose incomes fall below the poverty line. There are two assumptions underlying income-based measures of poverty. First, there is that tendency to equate income with the ability to control income. While women may control earned income, the limits on poor women's financial sovereignty have been well demonstrated. An income-based measure may hide the extent and nature of poverty when women earn an income but have no control over those earnings. While the question of who controls income is a delicate matter for women, it is also relevant to the position and well-being of men. Societies that place upon individuals a heavy communal, kinship or clan-based obligation may end in both women and men having limited control over individual income. Second, is the assumption that income creates equal access and generates equal benefits. Access to education illustrates the point. While lack of financial resources may result in low enrollment or high drop-out rates among poor children, social values around the role of women and the importance of formal education for girls are likely to be more meaningful in demonstrating the difference between male and female enrollment rates. Causes While the feminization of poverty is a useful conceptual tool, the issue remains as to its root causes. There are several factors that place women at high risk of poverty. These include change of family structure, gender wage gaps, women's prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing public benefits. Feminisation of poverty is a problem which may be most severe in parts of South Asia, and may also differ by social class. Although low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. The image of a \\"traditional\\" woman and a traditional role still influences many cultures in today's world and is still not in full realization that women are essential part of the economy. In addition, income poverty lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens the cycle of poverty. Beyond income, poverty manifests in other dimensions such as time poverty and capability deprivations. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations. =Single mother households= Single mother households are critical in addressing feminization of poverty and can be broadly defined as households in which there are female headships and no male headships. Single mother households are at the highest risk of poverty for women due to lack of Income and resources. There is a continuing increase of single mother households in the world, which results in higher percentages of women in poverty. Single mothers are the poorest women in society, and their children tend to be disadvantaged in comparison to their peers. Different factors can be taken into account for the rise in the number of female headship in households. While never-married heads of household are also at economic risk, changes of family structure, particularly divorce, are the major cause of initial spells of poverty among female-headed households. When men become migrant workers, women are left to be the main caretaker of their homes. Those women who have the opportunity to work usually don't get better jobs with a furthered education. They are left with jobs that don't offer financial sustainability or benefits. Other factors such as illnesses and deaths of husbands lead to an increase in single mother households in developing countries. Female headed households are most susceptible to poverty because they have fewer income earners to provide financial support within the household. According to a case study in Zimbabwe, households headed by widows have an income of approximately half that of male-headed households, and de facto female headed households have about three-quarters of the income of male headed households. Additionally, single mother households lack critical resources in life, which worsens their state of poverty. They do not have access to the opportunities to attain a decent standard of living along with basic needs such as health and education. Single mother households relate to gender inequality issues as women are more susceptible to poverty and lack essential life needs in comparison to men.The World's Women 2015, Poverty, 2015 Parenting in poverty ridden conditions can cause emotional instability for a child and their relationship with a single mother. Many factors contribute to becoming impoverished. Some of these factors are more prevalent in the lives of single mothers. When demographic attributes of single mothers are surveyed, a few factors showed up in higher rates. Marital status (divorced or widowed), education, and race correlated strongly with levels of poverty for single mothers. Specifically, very few mothers on the poverty line had a college degree and were having to \\"work to make ends meet\\". Not only do these demographic attributes affect parenting in poverty, emotional attributes provided an instability as well when viewed by Dr. Bloom. Mothers have been noted as the \\"caregivers\\" or \\"nurturer\\" of families. Some stereotypical things that are expected of mothers are harder to provide in a low-income household when a mother is the main provider. Dr. Bloom's example of a stereotypical mother job was bringing treats to school on birthdays and expected to go to parent teacher conferences. A researcher, Denise Zabkiewicz, surveyed single mothers in poverty and measured rates of depression over time. Since recent studies in 2010 had brought the idea that work was beneficial for mental health, Zabkiewicz thought to research if jobs were mentally beneficial to poverty line single mothers. Those results concluded to be true; mothers' rates of depression were significantly lower when one held a stable, long-term job. The likelihood of getting a full-time job decreases with certain factors. When these certain factors were surveyed in single moms they occurred at higher rates: co-inhabiting, college degree, and use of welfare. All of these factors are ones that the researchers, Brian Brown and Daniel Lichter, identified as contributing to single mothers' poverty. =Employment= \\"Unemployable uterus\\", a graffito in Ljubljana, Slovenia Employment opportunities are limited for women worldwide. The ability to materially control one's environment by gaining equal access to work that is humanizing and allows for meaningful relationships with other workers is an essential capability. Preview. Employment is not only about financial independence, but about higher security through an established legal position, real world experience, deeply important for sheltered or shy women, and higher regard within the family, which gives women a better bargaining position. Though there has been major growth in women's employment, the quality of the jobs still remains deeply unequal. Teenage motherhood is a factor that corresponds to poverty. There are two kinds of employment: Formal and Informal. Formal employment is government regulated and workers are insured a wage and certain rights. Informal employment takes place in small, unregistered enterprises. It is generally a large source of employment for women. The burden of informal care work falls predominantly on women, who work longer and harder in this role than men. This affects their ability to hold other jobs and change positions, the hours they can work, and their decision to give up work. However, women who have University degrees or other forms of higher learning tend to stay in their jobs even with caring responsibilities, which suggests that the human capital from this experience causes women to feel opportunity costs when they lose their employment. Having children has also historically affected women's choice to stay employed. While this \\"child-effect\\" has significantly decreased since the 1970s, women's employment is currently decreasing. This has less to do with child-rearing and more with a poor job market for all women, mothers and non-mothers alike. =Sexual violence= A form of sexual violence on the rise in the United States is Human Trafficking. Poverty can lead to increased trafficking due to more people on the streets. Women who are impoverished, foreign, socially deprived, or at other disadvantages are more susceptible to being recruited into trafficking. Many laws stated in Kelsey Tumiel's dissertation, have recently been made to try to combat the phenomenon, but it is predicted that human trafficking will surpass illegal drug trafficking amounts in the US. Women that are victims of these sexual violence acts have a difficult time escaping the life due to abuse of power, organized crime, and insufficient laws to protect them. There are more people current enslaved in trafficking than there were during the African slave trade. \\"Branding\\" of human trafficking brings awareness to the issue claims Tam Mai, the author. This allows for public assertion and intervention. A claim made in Tam Mai's article states that by reducing poverty, thus may lead to a decrease in trafficking from the streets. =Education= A major key to reducing women's poverty is to emphasize the importance of higher education. Basic education, gives the ability to make informed choices and have opportunities to achieve goals. This enables not only women to reduce household poverty, but as well increases children's chances of education, and enhances maternal health and freedom of movement. Although the world is making progress toward gender equality in education, approximately one quarter of girls in the developing world do not attend school. The strong gender discrimination and social hierarchies in these developing countries limit women's access to basic education. Gender implications and the social costs of poverty include the difference between the way boys and girls get treated in households, girls not getting the education desired, dropout rates from school for girls, the need in pushing girls to be married off quickly, girls having no right or control over fertility and girls choosing prostitution as an escape this portrays the inequality and the difference between the situations girls and boys suffer. Families that are poor and are living in rural areas of Africa will send their sons to school instead of their daughters for many different reasons. School fees will keep parents from sending their daughters to school because they are not deemed worthy of an education. Girls are also kept home to learn how to care for a family by doing chores, taking care of younger siblings, cooking and cleaning. Girls who are enrolled in school have a higher chance of dropping out compared to boys due to the chance of rape or sexual assault that could lead to an unwanted pregnancy.Kuwonu, F. (2015, April). Millions of girls remain out of school  Africa Renewal Online. Retrieved from https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/april-2015/millions-girls-remain- out-school There are extremely high levels of claims of professional misconduct, usually in the terms of sexual favors by females for grades. Because of sexual harassment by students and lecturers, there is a large inequality of higher education for females. =Climate change= Women are more likely to be poor, and to be responsible for the care of poor children, than men. Approximately 70 percent of the world's poor are women; rural women developing countries are among the most disadvantaged groups on the planet. They are therefore unlikely to have the necessary resources to cope with the changes brought by climate change, and very likely to suffer a worsening of their everyday conditions. Poor women are more likely to be hurt or killed by natural disasters and extreme weather events than men. There is also evidence to suggest that when households experience food shortages, women tend to go without so that their children may eat, with all the health implications this brings for them. Since poverty and climate change are closely linked, the poorest and most disadvantaged groups often depend on climate-sensitive livelihoods like agriculture, which makes them disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. These groups lack the resources required to weather severe climatic effects like better houses and drought-resistant crops. This diminished adaptive capacity makes them even more vulnerable, pushing them to take part in unsustainable environmental practices such as deforestation in order to maintain their well-being. The extent to which people are impacted by climate change is partially a function of their social status, power, poverty, and access to and control over resources. Women are more vulnerable to the influences of climate change since they make up the bulk of the world's poor and are more dependent for their livelihood on natural resources that are threatened by climate change. Limited mobility combined with unequal access to resources and to decision-making processes places women in rural areas in a position where they are disproportionately affected by climate change. There are three main arguments in association to women and climate change. Firstly, that women need special attention because they are the poorest of the poor; secondly, because they have a higher mortality rate during natural disasters caused by climate change and thirdly because women are more environmentally conscious. While the first two refer mainly to the women in the South, the last is especially apparent in the literature on gender and climate change in the North. The feminization of poverty has been used to illustrate differences between male and female poverty in a given context as well as changes in male and female poverty over time. Typically, this approach has fed the perception that female-headed households, however, defined, tend to be poorer than other households. Women are clearly more disadvantaged than men by poor household infrastructure or the lack of piped water and less-consuming energy sources. =Femonomics= In addition to earning less, women may encounter \\"Femonomics\\", or gender of money, a term created by Reeta Wolfsohn, CMSW, to reflect many of the inequities women face that increase their likelihood of suffering from financial difficulties. Pdf. The image of a \\"traditional\\" woman and a traditional role still influences many cultures in today's world and is still not in full realisation that women are essential part of the economy. Women have unique healthcare problems/access problems related to reproduction increasing both their healthcare costs and risks. Research also shows that females tend to live five years longer on average than men. The death of a spouse is an important determinant of female old-age poverty, as it leaves women in charge of the finances. However, women are more likely to be financially illiterate and thus have a harder time knowing how to manage their money. In 2009 Gornick et al. found that older women (over 60) were typically much wealthier than their national average in Germany, US, UK, Sweden and Italy (data from 1999‚Äì2001). In the US their wealth holdings were four times the national median. =Health= Women in poverty have reduced access to health care services and resources. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health, be adequately nourished, and have proper shelter can make an enormous difference to their lives. Gender inequality in society prevents women from utilizing care services and therefore puts women at risk of poor health, nutrition, and severe diseases. Women in poverty are also more vulnerable to sexual violence and risk of HIV/AIDS, as they are less able to defend themselves from influential people who might sexually abuse them. HIV transmission adds to the stigma and social risk for women and girls. Other ailments such as malnutrition and parasite burden can weaken the mother and create a dangerous environment, making sex, birth, and maternal care riskier for poor women. In Korea poor health is a key factor in household poverty. =Women as a solution to poverty= Due to financial aid programs for impoverished families assuming only women to be responsible for the maintenance of a household and caring for children, the burden may fall on women to ensure this financial aid is properly managed. Such programs also tend to assume that women all have the same social standing and needs, even though this is not the case. This effect is exacerbated by the increased number of NGOs targeting solely female development. Women are expected to maintain the household as well as lift the family out of poverty, responsibilities which can add to the burden of poverty that females face in developing nations. In many areas, Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programs provide direct financial assistance to women with the goal of lifting them out of poverty, but they often end up limiting women's income-earning potential. The programs typically expect women to be responsible for the health and educational outcomes of their children, as well as require them to complete other program activities that don't allow them the time to pursue vocational or educational opportunities that would result in higher income-earning potential. Forms of PovertyDecision-making power= Decision-making power is central to the bargaining position of women within the household. It is how women and men make decisions that affect the entire household unit. However, women and men often have very different priorities when it comes to determining what is most important for the family. Factors that determine which member of the household has the most power in decision-making vary across cultures, but in most countries there is extreme gender inequality. Men of the household usually have the power to determine what choices are made towards women's health, their ability to visit friends and family, and household expenditures. The ability to make choices for their own health affects both women and children's health. How household expenditures are decided affects women and children's education, health, and well-being. Women's freedom of mobility affects their ability to provide for their own needs as well as for the needs of their children. Gender discrimination within households is often rooted in patriarchal biases against the social status of women. Major determinants of the household bargaining power include control of income and assets, age, and access to and level of education. As women's decision-making power increases, the welfare of their children and the family in general benefits. Women who achieve greater education are also more likely to worry about their children's survival, nutrition, and school attendance.UNICEF. \\"Women and Children: The Double Dividend of Gender Equality.\\" The State of the World's Children (2007): 1‚Äì148. Print. =Disparate income= Lack of income is a principal reason for women's risk of poverty. Income deprivation prevents women from attaining resources and converting their monetary resources into socioeconomic status. Not only does higher income allow greater access to job skills; obtaining more job skills raises income as well. As women earn less income than men, and struggle to access public benefits. They are deprived of basic education and health care, which eventually becomes a cycle to debilitate women's ability to earn higher income.Sen, Amartya. \\"Poverty as Capability Deprivation.\\" Development as Freedom. 1999. 87‚Äì110. Print. =Lack of assets= According to Martha Nussbaum, one central human functional capability is being able to hold property of both land and movable goods. In various nations, women are not full equals under the law, which means they do not have the same property rights as men; the rights to make a contract; or the rights of association, mobility, and religious liberty. Assets are primarily owned by husbands or are used for household production or consumption, neither of which help women with loan repayments. In order to refund their loans, women are usually required to undergo the 'disempowering' process of having to work harder as wage laborers, while also encountering a growing gendered resource divide at the domestic level. One of the major factors influencing women to greater poverty are the limited opportunities, capabilities, and empowerment in terms of access to and control over production resources of land, labor, human capital assets including education and health, and social capital assets such as participation at various levels, legal rights, and protection. =Time poverty= Time is a component that is included in poverty because it is an essential resource that is oftentimes distributed inequitably across individuals, especially in the context of the inadequacy of other resources. It is extremely relevant to gender, with a marked difference in gender roles and responsibilities observed across the world. Women are certainly more time- poor than men across the income distribution. Women concentrate on reproductive or unremunerated activities, while men concentrate in productive or compensated activities. Women generally face more limited access to leisure and work more hours in the sum of productive and reproductive work than do men. Time poverty can be interpreted in regards to the lack of sufficient time to rest and sleep. The greater the time devoted to paid or unremunerated work, the less time there is available for other activities such as relaxation and pleasure. A person who lacks adequate time to sleep and rest, levies and works in a state of 'time poverty'. The allocation of time between women and men in the household and in the economy, is a major gender issue in the evolving discourse on time poverty. According to the capabilities approach, any inquiry into people's well-being must involve asking not only how much people make but also how they manage their time in order to obtain the goods and services to meet their livelihoods. Time poverty is a serious constraint on individual well-being as it prevents having sufficient rest and sleep, enjoying leisure, and taking part in community or social life. =Capability deprivations= Since the last twenty-five years, feminist research has consistently stressed the importance of more holistic conceptual frameworks to encapsulate gendered privation. These include: 'capability' and 'human development' frameworks, which identify factors such as deprivations in education and health. Another is 'livelihoods' frameworks, which indicate social as well as material assets. Also, 'social exclusion' perspectives, which highlight the marginalization of the poor; and frameworks which stress the significance of subjective dimensions of poverty such as self-esteem, dignity, choice, and power. A higher share of women than of men are poor, women undergo greater depth or severity of poverty than men, women are likely to experience more persistent and longer-term poverty than men, women's irregular burden of poverty is increasing relative to men, women face more difficulties in lifting themselves out of poverty, and women-headed households are the 'poorest of the poor' are the common characterizations of the 'Feminization of poverty'. =Deprivation of health outcomes= Poor women are more vulnerable to chronic diseases because of material deprivation and psychosocial stress, higher levels of risk behavior, unhealthy living conditions and limited access to good quality healthcare. Women are more susceptible to diseases in poverty because they are less well-nourished and healthy than men and more vulnerable to physical violence and sexual abuse. Being able to have good health, including reproductive health, be adequately nourished, and have adequate shelter can make an enormous difference to their lives. Violence against women is a major contributing factor to HIV infection. Stillwaggon argues that in sub-Saharan Africa poverty associated with high-risk for HIV transmission adds to the stigma and social risk for women and girls in particular. Poverty and its correlates like malnutrition and parasite burden can weaken the host and create a dangerous environment, making sex and birth and medical care riskier for poor women. =Social and cultural exclusions= Other metrics can be used besides the poverty line, to see whether or not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries have social and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty. Measures of poverty An important aspect of analyzing the feminization of poverty is the understanding of how it is measured. It is inaccurate to assume that income is the only deprivation that affects women's poverty. To examine the issue from a multidimensional perspective, there must first be accurate and indices available for policy makers interested in gender empowerment. Often aggregate indices are criticized for their concentration on monetary issues, especially when data on women's income is sparse and groups women into one large, undifferentiated mass. Three indexes often examined are Gender-related Development Index, Gender Empowerment Measure, and Human Poverty Index. The first two are gendered- indices, in that they specifically gather data on women to evaluate gender inequalities, and are useful in understanding disparities in gender opportunities and choices. HPI, however, focuses on deprivation measures rather than income measures. GDI adjusts the Human Development Index in three ways: * Shows longevity, or life-expectancy of females and males * Education or knowledge * Decent standard of living The aim of this index is to rank countries according to both their absolute level of human development and relative scores on gender equality. Although this index has increased government attention to gender inequality and development, its three measures have often been criticized for neglecting important aspects. Its relevance, however, continues to be integral to the understanding of the feminization of poverty, as countries with lower scores may then be then stimulated to focus on policies to assess and reduce gender disparities. GEM measures female political and income opportunities through: * Analyzing how many seats of government are occupied by women * Proportion of management positions occupied by women * Female share of jobs * Estimated female to male income ratio HPI is a multidimensional, non-income-based approach. It takes into consideration four dimensions: * Survival * Knowledge * Decent standard of living * Social participation This index is useful in understanding and illuminating the differences between human poverty (which focuses on the denial of basic rights, such as dignity and freedom) and income poverty. For example, despite the U.S.'s high income stability, it is also ranked among the highest developed nations in human poverty. In her article, \\"Towards a Gendered Human Poverty Measure\\", Elizabeth Durbin critiques HPI and expands on the possibility of a gender-sensitive index. She argues that HPI incorporates three dimensions of poverty: life span measured by the proportion of the population expected to die before age 40, lack of knowledge measured by the proportion who are illiterate, and a decent standard of living measured by a composite index of access to health services, access to safe water, and malnutrition among children less than 5, that could specifically account for gender disparities. Despite its uses, however, it is important to note that HPI cannot be a true measure of poverty because it fails to examine certain deprivations, such as lack of property ownership and credit, that are essential to a stronger bargaining position in the household for women. Religion Within many of the major religious groups in the world, focus is placed upon traditional gender roles and each individual's duty. Many devout followers of each religion have used their respective religious texts or rulings to further the poverty cycle of women around the world. =Islam= In a 2004 report by the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, Muslim women were found more likely to work part-time jobs than Muslim men because of their religion's emphasis on the role of women as caregivers and housekeepers. The study found that these women are more likely to be financially dependent than men because of they choose to participate less in the labor market. Muslim women who choose to wear traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs may have a more difficult time finding employment than those who do not wear such clothing. On the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for refusing to remove her hijab at work because it violated the company's \\"no hat\\" rule. In the 2008 case Webb versus Philadelphia, the court ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality. Because of the violation of this standard, she was not allowed to legally wear the hijab while on duty. =Traditional Judaism= Under traditional Halachic law, Jewish women are also considered to be household caregivers rather than breadwinners. Within the Jewish text, the Mishnah, it states \\"she should fill for him his cup, make ready his bed and wash his face, hands and feet,\\" when describing the role of women under Jewish law. =Christianity= Certain sects of Christianity also regard women as more family-oriented than men. Women in certain sects of Christianity, namely Pentecostal women, may leave their faith traditions in order to obtain employment and escape poverty. Female poverty by region Many developing countries in the world have exceptionally high rates of females under the poverty line. Many countries in Asia, Africa, and parts of Europe deprive women of access to higher income and important capabilities. Women in these countries are disproportionately put at the highest risk of poverty and continue to face social and cultural barriers that prevent them from escaping poverty. =East Asia= Although China has grown tremendously in its economy over the past years, its economic growth has had minimal effect on decreasing the number of females below the poverty line. Economic growth did not reduce gender gaps in income or provide more formal employment opportunities for women. Instead, China's economic growth increased its use of informal employment, which has affected women disproportionately. In the Republic of Korea, low wages for women helped instigate an economic growth in Korea since low-cost exports were mostly produced by women. Similar to China, Korean women mostly had the opportunity for informal employment, which deprives women of financial stability and safe working environments. Although women in East Asia had greater access to employment, they faced job segregation in export industries, which placed them at a high risk of poverty. China is a country with a long history of gender discrimination. In order to address gender inequality issues, Chinese leaders have created more access for women to obtain capabilities. As a result, Chinese women are granted greater access to health services, employment opportunities, and general recognition for their important contributions to the economy and society. = Africa = Women in Africa face considerable barriers to achieving economic equality with their male counterparts due to a general lack of property rights, access to credit, education and technical skills, health, protection against gender- based violence, and political power. Although women work 50% longer workdays than men, they receive two-thirds of the pay of their male counterparts and hold only 40% of formal salaried jobs. The longer workdays can be attributed to the cultural expectations of women to perform forms of unpaid labor such as gathering firewood, drawing water, childcare, eldercare, and housework. Women face greater challenges in finding employment because of their lack of education. According to Montenegro and Patrinos, one additional year of primary, secondary, and tertiary school can increase future wages by 17.5%, 12.7%, and 21.3% respectively. Unfortunately, due to factors such as child marriage, early pregnancy, and cultural norms, only 21% of girls complete tertiary school. Without formal property rights, women in Africa only own 15% of the land, which makes them more vulnerable to be economically dependent on male family members or partners and diminishes their ability to use property to access financial systems such as banks and loans. As a result of having less economic power, women are generally more vulnerable to gender-based violence and risk of HIV/AIDS. =Morocco= The female population, especially in rural areas, dominantly represents the face of poverty in Morocco. There have been two major methods to measure poverty in Morocco, which include the 'classic approach' and a second approach that pertains more towards the capabilities approach. The 'classic approach' uses the poverty line to statistically determine the impoverished population. This approach quantifies the number of poor individuals and households but does not take into account how the impoverished population lacks basic needs such as housing, food, health and education. The second approach focuses on satisfying this lack of basic needs and emphasizes the multidimensional nature of poverty. Moroccan women represent the most economically insecure social group in the country. One of six Moroccan households are lone-mother households, which represent the most impoverished households in the country. Women are categorized to have the highest levels of socio-economic and legal constraints, which exclude them from obtaining their basic needs. Although recent surveys show that women actively help in providing for their families economically, Moroccan legal texts discourage women's participation in economic productivity. Article 114 of the Moroccan Family Law states, \\"every human being is responsible for providing for his needs by his own powers except the wife whose needs will be taken care of by her husband.\\" The patriarchal social structure of Morocco puts women as being inferior to men in all aspects. Women are denied equal opportunities in education and employment before the law, as well as access to resources. As a result, the female population in Morocco suffers from deprivation of capabilities. Young girls are often excluded from educational opportunities due to limited financial resources within the household and the burden of household chores expected from them. Over time, Moroccan women have gained more access to employment. However, this quantitative increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into a higher risk of poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty is heightened. Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, women are more likely to lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most. =United Kingdom= An investigation of women below the poverty line in the United Kingdom between 1959 and 1984 discovered a substantial increase in the percentage of women who are in poverty in the 1960s. The percentage remained relatively constant in the 1970s, and then decreased between 1979 and 1984. The increase of women below the poverty line in the 1960s was determined to be from an increase of women in one-sex households. This was more adverse for black women than white women. =Dominican Republic= Dominican women make generally forty-four cents on the dollar as compared to men. This wage gap often leads to a high level of food insecurity among women in the Dominican Republic. Those in poverty have an increased likelihood to participate in dangerous behaviors such as unprotected sex and drug use. These behaviors put them at a greater risk for contracting HIV and other diseases. There is a negative stigma around HIV positive women in the Dominican Republic. For this reason, women are more likely to be subjected to health screenings when applying for a job. If the screening reveals a person is HIV positive, they are less likely to be given employment. =United States= In 2016, 14.0% of women and 11.3% of men were below the poverty threshold. The 2016 poverty threshold was $12,228 for single people and $24,339 for a family of four with two children. In response, the United States government provides financial assistance to those who do not earn as much money. In 2015, 23.2% of women were given financial assistance compared with 19.3% of men. More women are given financial assistance than men in all government programs (Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance, SSI, TANF/GA). Women were given 86% of child-support in 2013. =India= The poverty that women experience in India is known as human poverty, or issues of inadequate food, housing, education, healthcare, sanitation, poor developmental policies, and more. Poverty has been prevalent in India for many years, but there was a noticeable increase after globalization in 1991 when the International Monetary Fund instilled a structural adjustment program (SAP) in order to give India a loan. Large amounts of capital flowed into the country but also led to the exploitation of the Indian market, particularly of women for their cheap labor. This reduced their opportunities for education and escape from the poverty trap. The Indian Constitution has proclaimed that all citizens have equal rights, but this is not always practiced by all Indians. Sex-selective abortion is a wide phenomenon in India in which males are preferentially selected. In order to get married, it is normal to see the girl's family paying dowry to the male's family. This leads to more sex-selective abortion as females are more costly for the family, and less focus on female development. Home life Women are restricted in India due to a heavy dependency of social status on female appearance and activity around the home. Poor behavior on their part results in lower social status and shame for the male head of the family. Women are expected to maintain the household with a strict schedule. Husbands often move to the city to find work and leave their wife as the primary earner in their absence. Women in these situations may resort to using favors or borrowing money in order to survive, which they must later return in cash with interest. Young girls are especially vulnerable to prostitution or bribing as a form of repayment. Competition amongst women around water, food, and employment is also prevalent, especially in urban slums. Employment The expectation for Indian women is to be the sole care taker and maintainer of the home. If women leave their children and work they are often left in the hands of a poor care taker (possibly the eldest daughter) and don't get enough resources for development. In many areas working outside of the home is seen as symbolic of having low status. Upper- class women have similar social restrictions, although lower class females frequently have a larger necessity of the added income than upper class females. Men tend to send money back to extended family, whereas money that a woman makes goes to her husband. This reduces the incentive of the family to urge their daughter to find work as they wouldn't receive money but would face shame in society. Conceptual barriers prevent women from being accepted as equally paid and equally able laborers. In many ways women are seen as excess reserve labor and get pushed into roles that are known as being dirty, unorganized, arduous, and underdeveloped. They are hurt by the mechanization of industries and while self-employment is a viable option, there is always a large risk of failure and exploitation. Healthcare Healthcare is difficult to access for women, particularly elderly women. Public clinics are overcrowded, understaffed, and have high transportation costs, while private clinics are too expensive without insurance. Females are more likely to get ill than males although males receive medical advice with higher frequency. Women frequently feel as if they are a burden to their husband or son when they get sick and require money to purchase the correct medicines. Some believe that their symptoms are not serious or important enough to spend money on. When women do receive some form of care, many times medical providers are biased against them and are partial to treating males over females. Many mothers also die during childbirth or pregnancy as they suffer from malnutrition and anemia. Over 50% of women in the National Family Health Surveys were anemic. Nutrition Poverty is a large source of malnutrition in women. Women in poverty are not allowed to eat the nutritious food that men are when it is available. While it is the women's job to obtain the food, it is fed to the males of the household. The 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey found that more men drink milk and eat fruit in comparison to women, and that less than 5% of females in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan eat meat or eggs. Poor nutrition begins at a young age and gets worse as women mature and become mothers. Education Effective policies to aid in expanding female education aren't productively enforced by the Government of India. Data from the 2001 census showed that primary school completion rates were around 62% for males and 40% for females. Teenage girls are generally taught how to care for their siblings and cook food and not taught math or science. Some families may believe men to be more qualified than women to get a higher paying job. In many instances this inequality between male and female education leads to child marriage, teenage pregnancies, and a male dominated household. Evidence suggests that educating girls results in reduced fertility, due to an urge to work and pursue higher social status. This lessens the financial burden on families. PoliciesConditional cash transfer= Conditional cash transfer is a possible policy for addressing current and intergenerational poverty where poor women play a central role. Women in the role as mothers are given the additional work burdens imposed. Conditional cash transfers are not ideal for addressing single-mother poverty. =Microcredit= Microcredit can be a potential policy for assisting poor women in developing countries. Microcredit is a tool design to hopefully alleviate poverty given that women living in developing countries have very few resources and connections for survival due to not having a solid financial foundation. =Welfare reform in the U.S.= In light of welfare reforms as of 2001, federal legislation required recipients of welfare (mainly aided to families) to participate in an educational or vocational school and work part-time in order to receive the benefits. Recipients attending a college now have 3 years to complete those degree in order to get people to work as quickly as possible. To try towards a system of reward, Mojisola Tiamiyu and Shelley Mitchell, suggest implementing child care services to promote employment. Women with children work in either low-paying or part-time jobs that are insufficient to raise a family. Single parenting in the United States has increased to 1 in 4 families being headed by a single parent.

Articles such as ‚ÄúThe New Woman and Education‚Äù, ‚ÄúLiberation of Women and the Nuclear Family‚Äù and ‚ÄúWomen and Career‚Äù were printed to stimulate women's participation in society and the development of women's rights. Dong-A Ilbo also hosted athletic events for women. ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs National Tennis Competition‚Äù is Korea's and Dong-As oldest contest ever to be held. =Forced closure: Erasing of Japanese flag= In 1939 when World War II erupted, the Japanese government began a campaign to unify Korea and Japan as a culture. This meant the suppression of much of Korea's cultural identity. After four attempts to close DongA Ilbo and other numerous occasions of inspection, censorship, seizure and deletion, the Japanese government succeeded in August 1940. The Dong-A Ilbo built Dong-A Broadcasting System. Under the Chun Doo- hwan regime, South Korea's media policy had changed. The regime had closed several radio and TV networks and DBS was forced to give most of its shares to the government. The Dong-A Ilbo gave up DBS in 1980. The event that made forced closure possible was Dong-A Ilbo's deliberate obscuration of the Japanese flag in a photograph of the first ever Korean Olympic Gold medalist. Sohn Kee-Chung won the gold medal in marathon at the 11th Summer Olympics in Berlin (1936); however, because Korea was under Japanese rule, his uniform featured the Japanese flag. The article showed pride for the Korean athlete and featured a smudged Japanese flag to promote nationalistic ideas. =Awards and recognition= * Receives Korea's Best Brand Award (2006) * Dong-A Ilbo President Sang-man Kim receives Press Freedom Golden Pen award (1975) * Awarded for efforts made in freedom of speech by US Freedom House (1974) * Staff reporters receive Korea Reporter's Award (1971) CompanyReadership= * Circulation: over 52 million * About 51% of the readers are in their 30s - 40s * Over 50% of the readers live in metropolitan area * 55% of the readers are university educated or higher =International partnerships= Dong-A Ilbo has partnered with internationally acclaimed news companies such as the New York Times and Reuters.

It is located on Lake Superior, and is the eastern gateway to the Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore via H-58. History The name Grand Marais (French: great marsh) is a reference to the large, shallow harbor. French explorers used the word \\"marais\\" to mean \\"harbor of refuge\\" as well as \\"marsh.\\" A breakwater was later built that extends from the bay into Lake Superior. The Grand Marais Outer Range Light is at its end,Terry Pepper, \\"Seeing the Light, Grand Marais Light\\". and the Fresnel lens is still operative. It is one of only 70 such lenses that remain operational in the United States; 16 of these are in use on the Great Lakes, eight of which are in Michigan.United States Coast Guard, Fresnel Lenses Still in Operation. Many controversies in the little town relate to the costs of dredging and breakwall-repair operations to keep the harbor functioning. Grand Marais was one of five U.S. Life-Saving Service Stations established along the coast of Lake Superior between Munising and Whitefish Point in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was part of the U.S. Life-Saving Service District 10 (later part of District 11). The other four Life-saving Stations were Deer Park, Two Heart, Crisp Point Light, and Vermilion Point. In 1915, these stations became part of the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1939 the U.S. Lighthouse Service also merged under the control of the U.S. Coast Guard. The community was home to the Grand Marais Air Force Station from 1954 to 1957. The station was part of the Air Defense Command, and provided general surveillance radar along the northern frontier of the United States. Geography Grand Marais is the northern terminus of M-77. Seney and the Seney National Wildlife Refuge are to the south. Arts and culture Former Grand Marais Life-Saving Station, now serving as a Ranger Station Grand Marais is a four-season tourist destination.

He was born in Ma≈°nica, Plav, in northeastern Montenegro on 19 August 1907. Before World War II he lived in Skopje, Zagreb and Belgrade, working as a literary critic and a secondary school teacher,enciklopedija.hr and joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. His first book of poetry, Glineni golubovi (Clay Pigeons, 1937), was banned by the Yugoslav royal regime. He joined the Partisans in 1941, and after World War II he was briefly one of the most prominent figures in Yugoslav government, as head of the propaganda of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, authoring several programmatic and polemical articles and criticism from the standpoint of dogmatic real socialism (Na popri≈°tu, \\"At the scene\\", 1948). He was expelled from the League of Communists and put under house arrest in 1948 in connection with the Tito-Stalin split. He was accused of being Stalinist and for Montenegrin nationalism among else. In the late 1960s Zogoviƒá was semi- rehabilitated, and in that period his best works were published: poetry collections Prkosne strofe (\\"Defiant verses\\", 1947), ≈Ωilama za kamen (\\"Veins for the rock\\"), Artikulisana rijeƒç (\\"Articulated word\\", 1965), Liƒçno, sasvim liƒçno (\\"Personal, very personal\\"), Noƒá i pola vijeka (\\"A night and half a century\\", 1978) and Knja≈æevska kancelarija (The Prince's Office). He also wrote the novel Pejsa≈æi i ne≈°to se de≈°ava (\\"The landscape and something happens\\", 1968). His poetry at first was very socially engaged, critical and polemical towards social reality, while in the later songs predominate landscape and homeland motifs and reflection on youth, the passage of time and fate. His poems have been translated in many languages, and he himself translated works from Russian, Bulgarian, Turkish and Macedonian authors, including Vladimir Mayakovsky, Anna Akhmatova and Nazim Hikmet. Among his close friends were the Serbian poet Desanka Maksimoviƒá and the Montenegrin novelist Mihailo Laliƒá. He was a member of the Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts.

History Nassar, a devout Muslim, joined the ranks of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades in 1992 soon after the creation of the group. Early on he became personal bodyguard of Ahmed Yassin, one of the founders of Hamas and one of its spiritual leaders. He quickly took charge of a small group of militants and led several attacks against the IDF in the Gaza strip, which claimed the lives of at least two soldiers. Identified as a top leader of the brigades by 1995, Wa'el Nassar prepared to carry out a suicide bombing, but failed to infiltrate Israel and his plan was foiled. Placed on the list of people to kill or arrest by the IDF, Nassar was chased by the Palestinian Authority (PA), which was at that time engaged in a peace process with Israel, and arrested in 1996 by the PA. He was then placed in administrative detention and was released at the beginning of the Al-Aqsa Intifada. Living clandestinely in Gaza, Wa'el Nassar then recovered as a top leader of Hamas' brigades and led many cells of terrorists which carried out several sophisticated and lethal attacks against Israeli settlers and soldiers in Gaza. From 2000 to his death, Nassar directed operations that claimed, according to Hamas and IDF sources, the lives of at least 27 Israeli soldiers or civilians. Injured in 2001, when the mortar crew he led was hit by an Israeli missile fired from a helicopter, he recovered and masterminded several important terrorist operations. Among others, Nassar planned the suicide bombing carried out by Reem El-Reyashi on 14 January 2004, the first ever Hamas' female suicide bomber, which killed four Israeli soldiers at the Erez checkpoint north of the Gaza Strip. He was also blamed for the 21 March 2004, bombing of Ashdod, in southern Israel, which claimed the lives of 10 civilians and triggered an IDF reprisal which killed Hamas' spiritual leader and founder, sheik Ahmed Yasin. Actively searched for by Israel, Nassar, living in hiding, continued to lead groups of Hamas fighters and was reportedly in charge of the cell that detonated a powerful bomb under an Israeli armoured personnel carrier (APC) in Gaza City's Zeitun neighborhood, which killed 6 IDF soldiers during an Israeli incursion on 12 May 2004. Nassar's cell then collected body parts of the killed soldiers and exchanged them to Israel following their display in video. Vowing to avenge the soldier's deaths, Israel marked Nassar for death and actively searched for his whereabouts. On 30 May 2004, Wa'el Nassar was riding a motorcycle in Zeitun following an operation against an Israeli settlement when an IDF drone fired a missile at the vehicle, killing him and his assistant Mohammed Sarsour, as well as a bystander.

History North Shore in the background. Canada Place with Downtown Vancouver Canada Place was built on the land which was originally the Canadian Pacific Railway's Pier B-C. Built in 1927, its primary purpose was to serve CPR and other shipping lines trading across the Pacific Ocean. In 1978 Federal, Provincial and Municipal governments commenced planning for development of convention, cruise ship and hotel facilities. Four years later, the Government of Canada created a crown corporation, Canada Harbour Place Corporation (known as Canada Place Corporation until 2012), to develop the Canada Place project on the Pier B-C site. Construction began when Queen Elizabeth II arrived on the Royal Yacht Britannia with Pierre Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada and William R. Bennett, Premier of BC to initiate the first concrete pour. During Expo 86, the Canada Pavilion at Canada Place was opened by Prince Charles and Brian Mulroney, Prime Minister of Canada. Among the largest and most elaborate pavilions presented by any nation at any World's Fair, the Canada Pavilion hosted more than 5 million visitors prior to the October 13, 1986 closing date. Canada Place Corporation (CPC), a Crown agent, continues to act as the coordinating landlord for Canada Place facilities. =Events= Throughout the year many community events are held at and hosted by Canada Place.

In the X.500 Directory model, searches scoped near the root of the tree (e.g. at a particular country) were problematic to implement, as potentially hundreds or thousands of directory servers would need to be contacted in order to handle that query. The indexes contained summaries or subsets of information about individuals and organizations represented in a white pages schema. By merging subsets of information from multiple sources, it was hoped that an index server holding that subset could be able to process a query more efficiently by chaining it only to some of the sources: those sources which did not hold information would not be contacted. For example, if a server holding the base entry for a particular country were provided with a list of names of all the people in all the entries in that country subtree, then that server would be able to process a query searching for a person with a particular name by only chaining it to those servers which held data about such a person. The protocol evolved from earlier work developing WHOIS++, and was intended to be capable of interconnecting services from both the evolving WHOIS and LDAP activities. This protocol has not seen much recent deployment, as WHOIS and LDAP environments have followed separate evolution paths. WHOIS deployments are typically in domain name registrars, and its data management issues have been addressed through specifications for domain name registry interconnection such as CRISP. In contrast, enterprises that manage employee, customer or student identity data in an LDAP directory have looked to federation protocols for interconnection between organizations.

He was Director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the School of Arts and Sciences after 1930. Murray developed a theory of personality called personology, based on \\"need\\" and \\"press\\". Murray was also a co-developer, with Christiana Morgan, of the Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), which he referred to as \\"the second best-seller that Harvard ever published, second only to the Harvard Handbook of Music.\\" Early life & education Murray was born in New York City into a wealthy family of Henry Alexander Murray, Sr., and Fannie Morris Babcock, daughter of financier Samuel Denison Babcock. Murray had an older sister and a younger brother. Carver and Scheier note that \\"he got on well with his father but had a poor relationship with his mother\\", resulting in a deep-seated feeling of depression. They hypothesize that the disruption of this relationship led Murray to be especially aware of people's needs and their importance as underlying determinants of behavior.Carver and Scheier (1992) Perspectives on Personality (2nd edition), Allyn & Bacon. At Harvard, he majored in history with a poor performance, but compensated with football, rowing and boxing. At Columbia University he did much better in medicine, completed his M.D. and also received an M.A. in biology, in 1919. For the next two years he was an instructor in physiology at Harvard. He received his doctorate in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge in 1928, aged 35. In 1916, Murray married, aged 23, and after seven years of marriage, in 1923, he met and fell in love with Christiana Morgan. He experienced a serious conflict as he did not want to leave his wife, Josephine. This was a turning point in Murray's life as it raised his awareness of conflicting needs, the pressure that can result, and the links to motivation. Carver and Scheier note that it was Morgan who was \\"fascinated by the psychology of Carl Jung\\" and it was as a result of her urging that he meet Carl Jung in Switzerland. He described Jung as \\"The first full blooded, spherical‚Äîand Goethean, I would say, intelligence I had ever met.\\" He was analyzed by him and studied his works. \\"The experience of bringing a problem to a psychologist and receiving an answer that seemed to work had a great impact on Murray, leading him to seriously consider psychology as a career\\". Professional career During his period at Harvard, Murray sat in on lectures by Alfred North Whitehead, whose process philosophy marked his philosophical and metaphysical thinking throughout his professional career. In 1927, at the age of 33, Murray became assistant director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. He developed the concepts of latent needs (not openly displayed), manifest needs (observed in people's actions), \\"press\\" (external influences on motivation) and \\"thema\\"‚Äî\\"a pattern of press and need that coalesces around particular interactions\\". Murray collaborated with Stanley Cobb, Bullard Professor of Neuropathology at the Medical School, to introduce psychoanalysis into the Harvard curriculum but to keep those who taught it away from the decision-making apparatus in Vienna. He and Cobb set the stage for the founding of the Boston Psychoanalytic Society after 1931, but both were excluded from membership on political grounds. In 1935, Murray and Morgan developed the concept of apperception and the assumption that everyone's thinking is shaped by subjective processes, the rationale behind the Thematic apperception test. They used the term \\"apperception\\" to refer to the process of projecting fantasy imagery onto an objective stimulus. In 1937, Murray became director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic. In 1938 he published Explorations in Personality, a classic in psychology, which includes a description of the Thematic Apperception Test. In 1938 Murray acted as a consultant for the British Government, setting up the Officer Selection Board. Murray's work at The Harvard Psychological Clinic enabled him to apply his theories in the design of the selection processes with a \\"situation test\\", an assessment based on practical tasks and activities, an analysis of specific criteria (e.g. \\"leadership\\") by a number of raters across a range of activities. Results were pooled to achieve an overall assessment. =World War II, Office of Strategic Services, 1939-45= During World War II, he left Harvard and worked as lieutenant colonel for the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). James Miller, in charge of the selection of secret agents at the OSS during World War ll, said the situation test was used by British War Officer Selection Board and OSS to assess potential agents. In 1943 Murray helped complete Analysis of the Personality of Adolph Hitler, commissioned by OSS boss MGen. William \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan. The report was done in collaboration with psychoanalyst Walter C. Langer, Dr. Ernst Kris, New School for Social Research, and Dr. Bertram D. Lewin, New York Psychoanalytic Institute. The report used many sources to profile Hitler, including informants such as Ernst Hanfstaengl, Hermann Rauschning, Princess Stephanie von Hohenlohe, Gregor Strasser, Friedelinde Wagner, and Kurt Ludecke. The groundbreaking study was the pioneer of offender profiling and political psychology. In addition to predicting that Hitler would choose suicide if defeat for Germany was near, Murray's collaborative report stated that Hitler was impotent as far as heterosexual relations were concerned and that there was a possibility that Hitler had participated in a homosexual relationship. The report stated: \\"The belief that Hitler is homosexual has probably developed (a) from the fact that he does show so many feminine characteristics, and (b) from the fact that there were so many homosexuals in the Party during the early days and many continue to occupy important positions. It is probably true that Hitler calls Albert Forster \\"Bubi\\", which is a common nickname employed by homosexuals in addressing their partners.\\" =Harvard human experiments, 1959-62= In 1947, he returned to Harvard as a chief researcher, lectured and established with others the Psychological Clinic Annex. From late 1959 to early 1962, Murray was responsible for unethical experiments in which he used twenty-two Harvard undergraduates as research subjects. Among other goals, experiments sought to measure individuals' responses to extreme stress. The unwitting undergraduates were submitted to what Murray called \\"vehement, sweeping and personally abusive\\" attacks. Specifically-tailored assaults to their egos, cherished ideas and beliefs were used to cause high levels of stress and distress. The subjects then viewed recorded footage of their reactions to this verbal abuse repeatedly. Among them was 17-year-old Ted Kaczynski, a mathematician who went on to become the Unabomber, a domestic terrorist targeting academics and technologists for 18 years. Alston Chase's book Harvard and the Unabomber: The Education of an American Terrorist connects Kaczynski's abusive experiences under Murray to his later criminal career. In 1960, Timothy Leary started research in psychedelic drugs at Harvard, which Murray is said to have supervised.Jonathan D Moreno Harvard's Experiment on the Unabomber, Class of '62 Psychology Today May 25, 2012 Some sources have suggested that Murray's experiments were part of, or indemnified by, the US Government's research into mind control known as the MKUltra project. Retirement and death In 1962, Murray became emeritus professor, and earned the Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association and the Gold Medal Award for lifetime achievement from the American Psychological Foundation.Staff Henry A. Murray, M.D., Ph.D. Copyright 2001, The McGraw-Hill Companies. Murray died from pneumonia at the age of 95. Murray was a leading authority on the works of American author Herman Melville and amassed a collection of books, manuscripts and artifacts relating to Melville which he donated to the Berkshire Athenaeum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Personology Murray's Theory of Personality, also called personology, is explained in his book, Explorations in Personality, written in 1938. Murray's system of needs is an important part of the personological system. and developed while personality theory in psychology was becoming dominated by the statistics of trait theory. Patterned after chemistry's Henderson‚ÄìHasselbalch equation for the pH of a solution, personology was a holistic approach that studied the person at many levels of complexity all at the same time by an interdisciplinary team of investigators. According to Murray's ideas, an individual's personality develops dynamically as each person responds to complex elements in her or his specific environment. Murray viewed an individual's entire life as one unit, and pointed out that although a specific element of a person's life can be studied through psychology, this studied episode gives an incomplete picture of the entire life unit. To properly analyze the entire life cycle, Murray favored a narrative approach to studying personality, which he called \\"personology\\". The personological system has been used as an approach for multiple academic disciplines: philosophy, humanism, biological chemistry, and societal and cultural studies. Murray divided personology into five principles: (1) Cerebral physiology, rooted in the brain, governs all aspects of personality. (2) People act to reduce physiological and psychological tension to gain satisfaction, but do not strive to be tension-free, and rather cycle between seeking excitement, activity and movement in their lives and then relaxing. (3) An individual's personality continues to develop over time and is influenced by all of the events that occur over a person's lifetime. (4) Personality is not fixed and it can change and progress, and (5) Each person has some unique characteristics and others which are shared by everyone. Murray's theory of personality is rooted in psychoanalysis, and the chief business and aim of personology is the reconstruction of the individual's past life experiences in order to explain their present behavior. To study personality, Murray used free association and dream analysis to bring unconscious material to light. Murray's personality theories have been questioned by some psychologists, and extended by others, such as D. C. McClelland. Legacy Murray's identification of psychological needs, the Murray's system of needs, including Achievement, Affiliation and Power (1938) provided the theoretical basis for the later research of David McClelland and underpins development of competency-based models of management effectiveness such as Richard Boyatzis's. McClelland, Boyatzis and Spencer went on to found the McBer Consultancy. However, Murray's contribution is rarely acknowledged in contemporary academic literature. Explorations in Personality underlying principles were later adopted by AT&T; in the development of the Assessment Centre methodology, now widely used to assess management potential in both private and public sector organisations.

Plot Detective Virgil Tibbs, now a lieutenant with the San Francisco police, is assigned to investigate the murder of a prostitute. A prime suspect is Reverend Logan Sharpe, a liberal street preacher who is leading one of the sides in a city referendum on an urban renewal project. He tells Tibbs he was visiting the prostitute in his professional capacity, to advise her spiritually, and that when he left her apartment she was alive and healthy. Tibbs tracks down and questions the janitor from the victim's building, Mealie Williamson, and Woody Garfield, a shady character who owns the building and might have been the dead woman's pimp, who sent the janitor into hiding. Later, suspicion falls on a hood named Rice Weedon, who is pursued and shot by Tibbs in self-defense. Tibbs‚Äô ongoing investigation leads him to conclude that Sharpe really is the murderer. When confronted, Sharpe confesses; however he requests that Tibbs not arrest him for 24 hours, until the polls close on the city referendum. When Tibbs refuses, Sharpe, while being taken away to be arrested, purposefully steps in front of a moving vehicle and is killed.

It has 276,700 readers in Mexico City.\\"Seg√∫n el informe de Bimsa... en tercer sitio aparece Reforma con 276,700\\" The paper shares content with other papers in its parent newsgroup Grupo Reforma. The cumulative readership of the newsgroup is above 400,000. Reforma is named after the Mexico City avenue of the same name, Paseo de la Reforma, which is in turn named after \\"La Reforma\\", a series of liberal reforms undertaken by the country in the mid-19th century. The newspaper emphasizes its design, variety of columnists, and editorials that denounce political corruption. Reforma, along with the other newspapers of its parent, have an interest in color printing. The paper features weekly translations from selected articles of local interest from U.S. newspapers. These include The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The Sunday edition of Reforma formerly included a supplemental magazine titled Top Magazzine, which covered celebrity gossip, Hollywood previews and interviews. History Reforma's headquarters in Mexico City Reforma was founded in 1993, as an offshoot of El Norte, the noted Monterrey-based daily. Reforma was the first newsgroup in Mexico to separate its commercial division from its journalism division. This allows for a greater independence in journalism and helps journalists resist the temptation of writing favorable notes on sponsors. When it was founded, on November 20, the newspaper pressured unionized newsstands to sell the paper on that day. Since November 20 is the Mexican Revolution day, an obligatory public holiday in M√©xico, the unions refused, and so, that day's edition of Reforma had to be sold on the streets by journalists and celebrities to protest against what they considered \\"a boycott\\". Reforma changed the traditional distribution of newspapers because of its independence from the unionized newsstands and printed media resellers. It also was innovative because of the inclusion of people of all political opinions in its editorial pages. The newsgroup is 85 years old. It all started with the founding of El Sol in April 1922, followed by El Norte in 1938, Monterrey's Metro in 1988, Reforma in 1993, Palabra and Mexico City's Metro in 1997, Mural in 1998, Saltillo's Metro in 2004 and Guadalajara's Metro in 2005. Grupo Refoma's independent journalism drew the ire of the powerful Mexico City's carrier union barely a year after it was born. This syndicate controls distribution of all newspapers in the capital city and was traditionally used by the political system to bring down any paper that was deemed unacceptable. The carrier union boycotted the distribution of Reforma in Mexico City in October 1994. Grupo Reforma decided to create an independent distribution channel to sell Reforma on Mexico City's streets. The support of the readers was incredible: intellectuals, artists and regular folk joined Reforma's personnel in the process to create this independent distribution channel. Dozens of people went onto the streets to sell the paper, withstanding the verbal and even physical violence of the carrier union. Currently, Reforma is distributed independently to the homes of 85,000 subscribers, to supermarkets and other retail outlets and to readers in Mexico City's streets. The paper's daily circulation averages 200,000 copies. Grupo Reforma's dailies have an open journalism model that is very different from any other newspaper's in the world. One of the cornerstones of this model is its editorial boards. Each section of each of the papers has an editorial board, which is a group of readers and leaders in that section's area of interest who get together weekly or bi-monthly to set the section's editorial agenda. For example, the editorial board of Reforma's national section may include a diputado (member of the house of representatives), a senator, several politicians, some members of NGOs, as well as normal readers, like housewives, students, etc.... The boards have complete liberty of action in deciding what the paper is covering. Each board is led by its section's editor. This way, the board members on each board are working with the person who is directly responsible for the daily operation of each section. Each board session is divided in two parts. In the first one, the board members criticize the content of the section since the last time they met. What was done right? What needs to be corrected? What was plainly wrong? These and other similar topics are dealt with in this first discussion. During the next step in the session, the discussion centers on the work ahead. What stories should the section be working on? Who should the paper be interviewing? Are there any events that are worth covering? It is in this part of the meeting where the editorial agenda is defined by the group. Each year, 850 people are part of the 70 editorial boards that define the editorial agenda for all of Grupo Reforma's papers. More than 8 thousand people have been members of an editorial board during the 15 years that they have been in operation. Participation is voluntary, so no payment is given to the board members. The \\"payment\\" they receive is in seeing how they indeed are setting the agenda for some of the most influential newspapers in Mexico and in participating in a collaboration potentially able to transform Mexico. The boards are renewed every year, but a couple of the members are chosen by the same board to stay on, so there is some continuity with any work in progress that was left behind. Every quarter, the editor gives his/her board a balance of all the suggestions they've provided and how they have been implemented in the section. Accusations of bias The newspaper insists, like the other publications of the editorial group, that it is non-partisan, with an editorial style favoring an ostensibly neutral point of view and publishing opinions from journalists of all political positions (such as Miguel √Ångel Granados Chapa from the left, and Sergio Sarmiento from the right). Additionally, the newspaper alleges to have many fail-safes in place to prevent any partisan point of view. Despite its avowed independent editorial style, Reforma has been labeled as a right-wing newspaper in references by The Guardian, the Clarin, the San Antonio Express-News, the University of Miami school of communication and the Princeton Progressive Nation.Mexico  newsguide  Guardian Unlimited.

When the Derg took power in 1974 they relabeled the provinces as regions (kifle hager). By 1981 Addis Ababa had become a separate administrative division from Shewa, and Aseb was split off from Eritrea in 1981, making 16 administrative divisions in total.

As of February, 2014, the podcast was no longer broadcast on 105 The Tickethttp://www.tombarnardpodcast.com/ Personal Barnard was born in Long Prairie, Minnesota and raised in North Minneapolis. He and his wife Kathryn Brandt live in Edina, Minnesota. Career Before coming to KQRS, Barnard worked at numerous stations including WDGY and KSTP (as \\"The Catman\\"). Until 1986, he was the booth announcer for KSTP-TV. Barnard, and then-partner Dan Culhane, started the \\"Tom and Dan\\" show in 1986 featuring sports reports from WCCO-TV sports anchor Mark Rosen. At one point, the team of Barnard and Culhane spearheaded a write-in campaign to elect Rosen For Governor of Minnesota. Culhane was eventually pushed out of the broadcast in a personnel move, while Rosen was \\"persuaded\\" by WCCO TV's parent company to move his morning sports to WCCO-AM. Barnard is known for being very reclusive, refusing virtually all media interviews and rarely making public appearances. He did however recently give an in-depth interview to the St. Paul Pioneer Press in which he discussed his strained relationship with his deceased father and compared his radio persona to that of his actual personality. Earlier in his career, Barnard and Culhane were guests with two other Twin Cities radio show duos on a local morning television show in 1988. With podcasting technology, the KQRS Morning Show has reached national and international audiences. Regardless of the growth in his show's market, Barnard continuously assures listeners that the show will maintain its focus on the news, weather, sports and traffic of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. Although he is semi-retired from voice-over work, Barnard can currently be heard in radio ads for Home Depot. For many years Barnard's voice was heard in various markets, introducing shows and appearing on commercials. On September 29, 2009's Morning Show wrap-up, Barnard casually mentioned that he's planning to retire from live radio on December 21, 2012. Tom specifically said Terri would take over the Morning show, moments later the discussion moved to a \\"play off\\" for host during the year 2012. Tom explained that the 21st is a Friday and it's just before Christmas. On December 8, 2009, Tom Barnard said via Facebook, \\"After many weeks of discussion with my wife, Marc the G.M. of KQ and the guy who hired me, Dave Hamilton, I asked a very bright friend of mine what he thought of me leaving KQRS. He said, 'If there is any proof in this world that there is a God it is the life you have because of the unwavering support of KQ listeners. Only an idiot would walk away from that.' I guess they'll have to fire me someday. \\"I will be at KQ until they fire me or I drop over in my tracks. Hopefully , that will be a while. Thank you for your unbelievable support. (For the cynics out there, no, money doesn't enter in to it.)\\" On January 3, 2012, Tom Barnard stated via Facebook that this will likely be the last year he does the KQ morning show and that he would like the show to continue after he's gone instead of jeopardizing the jobs of everyone else who works on the show besides him. On July 12, 2012, Tom Barnard stated via Facebook that he signed a 4-year extension with KQRS. On March 29, 2013, Barnard announced on the air that he would be entering treatment for issues in regard to anger, not substance abuse as previously reported.KQ's Tom Barnard says he'll get treatment but remain on air Awards Barnard won the 2006 Marconi award for Large Market Personality of the Year.

Bernstein. It can be used to verify the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. A variant of Bernstein's Poly1305 that does not require AES has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force in RFC 8439. Description The original proposal, Poly1305-AES, which uses the AES (forward) encryption function as a source of pseudorandomness, computes a 128-bit (16 bytes) authenticator of a variable-length message. In addition to the message, it requires a 128-bit AES key, a 128-bit additional key r (with 106 effective key bits), and a 128-bit nonce which must be unique among all messages authenticated with the same key. The message is broken into 16-byte chunks which become coefficients of a polynomial evaluated at r, modulo the prime number 2130‚àí5. The authentication code is the sum of this polynomial evaluation, plus a pseudorandom value computed by passing the nonce through the AES block cipher. The name Poly1305-AES is derived from its use of polynomial evaluation, the 2130‚àí5 modulus, and AES. In NaCl, Poly1305 is used with Salsa20 in place of AES, and in TLS and SSH it is used with the ChaCha20 variant of the same. Google has selected Poly1305 along with Bernstein's ChaCha20 symmetric cipher as a replacement for RC4 in TLS/SSL, which is used for Internet security. Google's initial implementation is used in securing https (TLS/SSL) traffic between the Chrome browser on Android phones and Google's websites.Google Swaps Out Crypto Ciphers in OpenSSL, InfoSecurity, April 24, 2014 Use of ChaCha20/Poly1305 has been standardized in RFC 7905. Shortly after Google's adoption for use in TLS, both ChaCha20 and Poly1305 support was added to OpenSSH via the authenticated encryption cipher. Subsequently, this made it possible for OpenSSH to remove its dependency on OpenSSL through a compile-time option. Security The security of Poly1305-AES is very close to the underlying AES block cipher algorithm. Consequently, the only way for an attacker to break Poly1305-AES is to break AES. :For instance, assuming that messages are packets up to 1024 bytes; that the attacker sees 264 messages authenticated under a Poly1305-AES key; that the attacker attempts a whopping 275 forgeries; and that the attacker cannot break AES with probability above Œ¥; then, with probability at least 0.999999-Œ¥, all the 275 are rejected. Speed Poly1305-AES can be computed at high speed in various CPUs: for an n-byte message, no more than 3.1n+780 Athlon cycles are needed, for example. The author has released optimized source code for Athlon, Pentium Pro/II/III/M, PowerPC, and UltraSPARC, in addition to non-optimized reference implementations in C and C++ as public domain software.A state-of-the-art message-authentication code on cr.yp.to  Implementations  Below is a list of cryptography libraries that support Poly1305: * Botan * Bouncy Castle * Crypto++ * Libgcrypt * libsodium * Nettle * OpenSSL * LibreSSL * wolfCrypt * GnuTLS * mbed TLS * MatrixSSL ReferencesExternal links * Poly1305-AES reference and optimized implementation by author D.

Although primarily remembered as a batsman, he began his career as a fast- medium bowler. With George Lohmann, Tom Richardson and William Lockwood carrying all before them, Brockwell had few opportunities until they declined. However, from 1897 onwards, he was a very useful bowler and took 105 wickets in the 1899 season when Richardson was out of form and Lockwood never fully fit. Even in 1902, he took six for 37 on an excellent pitch in the last match of the season against Warwickshire. Born in Kingston upon Thames, Surrey, Brockwell played his county cricket for the very strong Surrey side of the last years of the 19th century. He made his first-class debut against Derbyshire in 1886. He played only occasionally up to 1890, but established himself in 1891 and 1892, when Surrey were at the height of their powers as a county side. However, it was not until 1893 that Brockwell became a vital member of the Surrey eleven, when he took 51 wickets at the same cost as the incomparable Richardson and, despite often going in late, proving to be one of the most consistent batsmen. In the very wet 1894 season, Brockwell, despite the consistently treacherous pitches, made a remarkable advance. He scored more runs (1,491) than any other player, and hit five centuries, and consequently was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year. He declined a great deal in 1895, but from the following year up to 1899, formed a formidable batting trio with Bobby Abel and Tom Hayward that made Surrey invincible on the perfect Oval pitches. Brockwell played seven Test matches for England, all against Australia ‚Äì one in 1893, five on the 1894/95 tour and a final match in 1899 ‚Äì but was not a success at this level and averaged under 17 with a highest score of just 49. He played on for Surrey until 1903, but from 1900 his powers as a batsman declined severely and after two final first-class matches for London County he retired from cricket. Brockwell spent the last fifteen years of his life homeless and he died in poverty at Richmond, Surrey.

Its principal architectural feature is a pair of terraces of white stucco-faced houses on the south side of the street overlooking St. James's Park. These terraces were built on Crown land between 1827 and 1832 to overall designs by John Nash, but with detailed input by other architects including Decimus Burton, who exclusively designed No. 3 and No.4. HistoryBackground= The land on which Carlton House Terrace was built had once been part of the grounds of St James's Palace, known as \\"the Royal Garden\\" and \\"the Wilderness\\". The latter was at one time in the possession of Prince Rupert of the Rhine (cousin of Charles II), and was later called Upper Spring Garden. Carleton, Burlington, the Prince Regent and John Nash From 1700 the land was held by Henry Boyle, who spent ¬£2,835 on improving the existing house in the Royal Garden. Queen Anne issued letters patent granting Boyle a lease for a term of 31 years from 2 November 1709 at ¬£35 per annum. Boyle was created Baron Carleton in 1714, and the property has been called after him since then, although at some point the \\"e\\" was dropped. On Carleton's death the lease passed to his nephew, the architect and aesthete Lord Burlington, and in January 1731 George II issued letters patent granting Burlington a reversionary lease for a further term of 40 years at an annual rent of ¬£35. By an indenture dated 23 February 1732 the lease was assigned to Frederick, Prince of Wales, eldest son of George II, who predeceased his father, dying in 1751; his widow, Augusta, continued living in the house, making alterations and purchasing an adjoining property to enlarge the site. She died in 1772 and the house devolved to her son, George III. The property was granted by George III to his eldest son, George, Prince of Wales (later Prince Regent) on the latter's coming of age in 1783. The Prince spent enormous sums on improving and enlarging the property, running up huge debts. He was at loggerheads with his father, and the house became a rival Court, and was the scene of a brilliant social life. When the Prince became King George IV in 1820 he moved to Buckingham Palace. Instructions were given in 1826 to the Commissioners of Woods and Forests that \\"Carlton Palace\\" should be given up to the public, be demolished and the site and gardens laid out as building ground for \\"dwelling houses of the First Class\\".Regent Street, Carlton Place Act 1826 (Act 7 Geo IV cap 77) By 1829 the Commissioners reported that the site was completely cleared and that part of it had already been let on building leases. Materials from the demolition were sold by public auction, with some fixtures transferred to Windsor Castle and to \\"The King's House, Pimlico\\". Columns of the portico were re-used in the design for the new National Gallery in Trafalgar Square, interior Ionic columns were moved to the conservatories of Buckingham Palace, and some of the armorial stained glass was incorporated in windows of Windsor Castle. =Construction= After Carlton House was demolished the development of its former site was originally intended to be part of a scheme for improving St James's Park. For this John Nash proposed three terraces of houses along the north of the Park, balanced by three along the south side, overlooking Birdcage Walk. None of the three southern terraces and only two of the three northern ones were built, the latter being the west (No.1‚Äì9) and east (No. 10‚Äì18) sections of Carlton House Terrace. These two blocks were designed by Nash and Decimus Burton, with James Pennethorne in charge of the construction. Decimus Burton exclusively, without Nash, designed No. 3 and No. 4. Carlton House Terrace. These elegant townhouses took the place of Carlton House, and the freehold still belongs to the Crown Estate. Nash planned to make contiguous the two blocks with a large domed fountain between them (re-using the old columns of the Carlton House portico), but the idea was vetoed by the King; the present-day Duke of York's Steps took the place of the fountain. In 1834 the Duke of York's Column was erected at the top of the steps. It consists of a granite column designed by Benjamin Wyatt topped with a bronze statue by Richard Westmacott of Frederick, Duke of York. The terrace seen from the south, with the squat Doric columns at ground level and the Corinthian columns and pediment above The terraces, which are four storeys in height above a basement, were designed in a classical style, stucco clad, with a Corinthian columned fa√ßade overlooking St James's Park, surmounted by an elaborate frieze and pediment. At the south side, facing the park, the lower frontage has a series of squat Doric columns, supporting a substantial podium terrace at a level between the street entrances to the north and the ground floor level of the modern Mall. The houses are unusual as they are expensive London terraces which have no mews to the rear. The reason for this was that Nash wanted the houses to make the best possible use of the view of the park, and also to present an attractive fa√ßade to the park. The service accommodation was placed underneath the podium and in two storeys of basements (rather than the usual one storey). According to the architectural historian Sir John Summerson Nash's designs were inspired by Ange-Jacques Gabriel's buildings in the Place de la Concorde, Paris. Summerson's praise of the buildings is muted: An end block of Carlton House Terrace and the Duke of York's Steps The authors of the Survey of London take a more favourable view: Although Nash delegated the supervision of building to Pennethorne, he kept the letting of the sites firmly in his own hands. Ground rents, payable to the Crown, were set at the high rate of 4 guineas per foot frontage. Nash himself took leases of five sites ‚Äì nos 11‚Äì15 intending to let them on the open market at a substantial profit. In the event he could not cover his total costs and made a small loss on the transactions. =Later history= In the 20th century the Terrace came under threat of partial or complete demolition and redevelopment, as were country houses at that time. By the 1930s there was little demand for large central London houses, and the Commissioners of Crown Lands were having difficulty in letting the properties. Two properties were let to clubs: no 1 to the Savage Club and no 16 to Crockford's gambling club, but residential tenants became hard to find. Proposals for redevelopment were put forward by the architect Sir Reginald Blomfield, who had earlier been one of those responsible for replacing Nash's Regent Street buildings with larger structures in the Edwardian neo-classical style. Blomfield proposed rebuilding \\"in a manner suitable for hotels, large company offices, flats and similar purposes\\". The suggested new buildings were to be two storeys higher than Nash's houses, and there was an outcry that persuaded the Commissioners not to proceed with the scheme. The Terrace was severely damaged by German bombing during the Second World War. In the 1950s the British government considered acquiring the Terrace as the site for a new Foreign Office headquarters. The Nash fa√ßades were to be preserved, but it was widely felt that the height of the redevelopment behind them would be unacceptable. =Occupants= German Embassy, c. 1930. The West Terrace. Numbers 8 and 9, formerly the German Embassy and now the home of the Royal Society, are the tall houses at the near end of the terrace. The Terrace has had many famous residents, including: * Lord Cardigan (leader of the Charge of the Light Brigade): occupied number 17 from 1832‚Äì36. * Lord Palmerston (Prime Minister): at Number 5 from 1840‚Äì46. * Earl Grey (Prime Minister): at Number 13 from 1851‚Äì57 and again from 1859‚Äì80. * William Ewart Gladstone (Prime Minister): at Number 4 in 1856 and Number 11 from 1857‚Äì75. * Lord Curzon (Foreign Secretary and Viceroy of India): at Number 1 from 1905‚Äì25. * Lord Revelstoke (Baring family and Barings bank principal partner): at Number 3 from 1904‚Äì29. * William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor (American-born businessman): at Number 18 during at least 1906‚Äì1909. * Joachim von Ribbentrop (German Ambassador): at Numbers 8 and 9 from 1936‚Äì38. (The Prussian Legates, and later their successors the German Ambassadors, inhabited no 9 from 1849 until the Second World War, eventually taking no 8 also.) * Ashraf Marwan (Egyptian billionaire arms dealer and former spy): died after somehow falling from his flat in the terrace. * MI6's Section Y was housed in Number 3, Carlton Gardens (see below) after the Second World War for an undisclosed time. This department, headed by Col. Tom Grimson, analysed wiretap information and compared it with information from other sources. The British traitor George Blake was his deputy, and he was brought here for interrogation after his capture in 1961. Most of the houses are now occupied by businesses, institutes and learned societies. * Number 1 was the headquarters of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining from 1972 to 2015 and in April 2020 was owned by Salah Hamdan Albluewi through SAB Ventures.https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/QB/2020/1313.html * Number 2 is the UK branch of Carmignac Gestion * Numbers 3-4 house the Royal Academy of Engineering. * Number 5 is the location of the Turf Club. * Numbers 6‚Äì9 are now the home of the Royal Society (formerly 9, the Prussia House, was the German Embassy until 1945; it is now in Belgrave Square). * Numbers 10‚Äì11 house the British Academy. * Number 12 is the Institute of Contemporary Arts, which also occupies much of the basement of the East Terrace. * Numbers 13‚Äì16 are privately owned by the four Hinduja brothers, industrialists from India. * Number 17 is home to the Federation of British Artists and the Mall Galleries. * Number 18 is a private residence. * Number 20,a purpose built 1970's office building over a four level basement car park on the north side of the thoroughfare, is the global headquarters of mining company Anglo American plc. * Number 24 is a 1970's purpose built block of 15 flats adjoining Number 20. The Crown Estate had its headquarters for many years in four houses in the Terrace (Numbers 13‚Äì16). However, the organisation moved in 2006 to another property that it owns in New Burlington Place, an alleyway off Regent Street. In 2006, the Hinduja family purchased the vacated property for ¬£58 million. Carlton Gardens Carlton Gardens The plaque commemorating the headquarters of General de Gaulle at 4 Carlton Gardens in London during World War II At the west end of the Carlton House Terrace is a cul-de-sac called Carlton Gardens, which was developed at around the same time. It contained seven large houses. Robert Loyd-Lindsay, founder of the British Red Cross inherited Number 2 from his father-in-law Samuel Jones-Loyd, 1st Baron Overstone in 1883, and it remained his London residence until his death in 1901. His widow Lady Wantage later briefly leased Number 2 to Lord Kitchener. Number 4 was home to two Prime Ministers, Lord Palmerston and Arthur Balfour, and later served as Charles de Gaulle's government in exile, Free France. All the houses except numbers 1, 2 and 3 have been replaced by office blocks. Number 1 is an official ministerial residence normally used by the Foreign Secretary. Number 2 is used by the Privy Council Office. Number 3 has been owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin since January 2019.

It is a spin-off of the long-running Canadian series Da Vinci's Inquest. The creator, writer and executive producer of the series was Chris Haddock. Overview Nicholas Campbell reprises his role as Dominic Da Vinci, a former coroner entering municipal politics as the mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia. Da Vinci is based on the real-life experiences of Larry Campbell, the former chief coroner of Vancouver who was elected that city's mayor in 2002. With the series regular Ian Tracey (playing Mick Leary) inheriting the coroner's job, the show toggles back and forth between crime scenes and politics. Haddock says: \\"My approach was to make all the political stuff criminal and all the criminal stuff political.

On February 13, 2006, the CBC announced that the show would not be brought back for a second season in 2006, although they also indicated that negotiations were underway to reprise the Da Vinci character in a series of television movies, similar to the manner in which North of 60 continued after its run as a weekly series had ended. The first of those TV movies, The Quality of Life, aired on CBC on June 14, 2008. The show's final episode was aired on February 28, 2006. The program was repeated on the Canadian channel Showcase during the summer of 2008. CBC management has been criticized for cancelling the show to make room for other series that have since proved less successful.\\"Blame for The One belongs to two on top,\\" Toronto Star, Toronto, Ontario: August 4, 2006. pg.

It is the cathedral church of the Episcopal Diocese of California, led by Bishop Marc Andrus since 2006, while the cathedral's local parish has been led by Dean Malcolm Clemens Young since 2015. The parish, which was founded in 1849, lost its previous church building in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The parish opened a temporary facility in 1907, raised enough funds to start construction of the present cathedral in 1927, started using it in 1934, and completed final construction in 1964. The cathedral is famed for its mosaics by Jan Henryk De Rosen, a replica of Ghiberti's Gates of Paradise, two labyrinths, varied stained glass windows, Keith Haring AIDS Chapel altarpiece, and medieval and contemporary furnishings, as well as its forty- four bell carillon, three organs, and choirs. History The cathedral's ancestral parish, Grace Church, was founded in 1849 during the California Gold Rush; the Little Grace Chapel was built on Powell near Jackson across the street from the first Episcopal church in San Francisco, Trinity Church. After Trinity moved away, Grace Church moved into the larger building; this imposing third church, unofficially referred to as Grace \\"Cathedral\\" because of its size, was built at California and Stockton starting in 1862. The new church was consecrated on May 3, 1868. Prominent members of San Francisco society joined the parish in the third church, including Leland Stanford and William Henry Crocker. In 1865, Mark Twain published (in The Californian newspaper) purported private correspondence between himself and potential short-term rectors, satirizing the church's somewhat unsuccessful efforts to find a short-term rector in the 1860s and 1870s, \\"stating\\" that he had written to one New York priest who had already turned down Grace's offer of $7,000 per year (): \\"A word in your ear: say nothing to anybody - keep dark - but just pack up your traps and come along out here... They never expected you to clinch a bargain like that. I will go to work and get up a little competition among the cloth\\". Among the short-term rectors were roll film inventor Hannibal Goodwin and James Smith Bush, the great-grandfather of former US President George H. W. Bush and great-great-grandfather of former US President George W. Bush. When the 1862 building was destroyed in the fire following the 1906 earthquake, the Grace parish opened a temporary facility in 1907. The family of railroad baron and banker William Henry Crocker donated the site of their ruined Nob Hill property (on the block bounded by California, Jones, Sacramento, and Taylor) for a diocesan cathedral, which took its name and founding congregation from the nearby Grace parish. Dean J. Wilmer Gresham nurtured the young cathedral and work began on the present structure with the laying of the cornerstone in 1910. The cathedral was designed in English Gothic style by George Frederick Bodley in London, who died in 1907, with Lewis P. Hobart of San Francisco completing the plans thereafter. The parish raised enough funds to build a few small portions, moving the parish services into a small completed section in 1912, then moving into the larger crypt, when that was completed in 1914. At a dinner event in 1927, Bishop Edward L. Parsons told the audience that the Episcopal Diocese of California was launching a fundraising effort in 1928, looking to raise $3.6 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to complete the full cathedral. Over the next six years, the cathedral continued to expand, though the Great Depression hampered fundraising. By 1934, Grace parish was able to move its services into the chancel and partially complete nave of the cathedral. Further construction was put on hold until 1960, with the exception of one (of the two) bell towers, which was addressed whenever funds allowed, taking over seven years (1936‚Äì1943) to complete. Grace Cathedral remained in this state, with a large vacant space between the partial section of nave and the single bell tower, for the next 17 years. Once construction restarted in 1960, the cathedral quickly advanced, and was completed in 1964 as the third largest Episcopal cathedral in the nation. On March 28, 1965, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a sermon at Grace Cathedral as part of the festival celebrating its completion and consecration. The service took place on the Fourth Sunday of Lent. Approximately 5,000 people were present to hear King's sermon. It was the largest gathering at the cathedral for the next 37 years, until the September 11, 2001, memorial service took place.

The cathedral was built using ferroconcrete over four campaigns, lasting from 1928‚Äì30, 1931‚Äì34, 1939‚Äì43, and 1961‚Äì64. From 1914 to 1930, the congregation met in the present basement of the nave, now named the Founders Crypt. Services moved to the present Chapel of Grace in 1930, and by 1934, work on the Cathedral had been sufficiently completed to allow services to move there. Further work on the building was suspended by the Great Depression; the north tower was completed in 1943, followed by a long suspension in construction until 1960, when work on the final tower was started. The completion of the final tower in 1964 marked the end of structural construction, although much of the interior finish remains incomplete. The overall plan and exterior of the French Gothic cathedral is inspired by cathedrals at Amiens, Paris, Beauvais, and Chartres. The interior features are inspired by the Aragon Palma Cathedral, and the Chapel of Grace is drawn from the Sainte-Chapelle. Overall, Grace Cathedral is long, wide at the transepts, with a central spire (fl√®che) rising above street level. The towers are above street level. The entry floor of the cathedral is itself above street level, and the sanctuary floor is above sea level. Under the original Bodley plans, Grace Cathedral would have been smaller and more square, long and wide. =Works by Jan Henryk De Rosen= Grace Cathedral has a significant collection of varied works by Jan Henryk De Rosen. Among these are a faux-tile mural behind the Chapel of Grace reredos from 1932, the mural in the Chapel of the Nativity's Adoration from 1946 showing the Holy Family with the magi and shepherds. At the donor's request, the original angels hovering above were removed by the artist, however constellations still mark their place. De Rosen also included a little image of his boyhood home in Warsaw in the mural. On a smaller scale, De Rosen painted exquisite panels for the original old high altar which is now in the Chapel of St. Francis columbarium. The most visible works of De Rosen in Grace Cathedral are the historical aisle murals that were painted in 1949 and 1950 and composed in a style blending elements of the early Italian masters Giotto and Mantegna. =Ghiberti doors= Ghiberti doors The cathedral entrance has a large pair of doors, often called the \\"Ghiberti doors\\". They are reproductions of the doors of the Florence Baptistery by Lorenzo Ghiberti, also dubbed the \\"Gates of Paradise\\". Detail of the doors In 1943, the Nazi occupation government ordered the original doors to be removed from the Florence baptistery, along with other portable artworks, to protect them from bombing and possibly to give Hermann G√∂ring a chance to add them to his collection. They were hidden in a disused railway tunnel until 1944, and latex casts were made after their rediscovery. The replica doors were cast in 1956 from molds of the original doors and were destined for a war memorial, but when financing for the memorial fell through, San Francisco philanthropist Charles D. Field bought these replicas, and they were then shipped to San Francisco and installed on the newly completed church in time for its official dedication in 1964. The original Ghiberti doors are no longer installed in the baptistery as corrosion and weathering led conservators to decide that they must be preserved in a museum under a totally dry and controlled atmosphere. The doors now in the baptistery are more modern replicas installed in 1991. =Labyrinths= Labyrinth inside Grace Cathedral Laid out on the floor of Grace Cathedral is a labyrinth that is based on the famous medieval labyrinth of Cath√©drale Notre- Dame de Chartres (The Cathedral of Our Lady of Chartres) located in Chartres, France. There is also another labyrinth outside of the cathedral, in the courtyard of its cathedral close. =Windows= Contained in the cathedral are of stained glass windows by noted artists that depict over 1100 figures ranging from Adam and Eve to Albert Einstein. Thirty-two windows or window groups, dating from 1930 to 1966, were designed by American Charles Connick and his Boston studio. This includes the Chapel of Grace and baptistry window series that contains over 32,000 pieces of glass and covers nearly . The cathedral also contains 24 faceted windows by Gabriel Loire of Chartres, France, including the Human Endeavor series depicting John Glenn, Thurgood Marshall, Jane Addams, Robert Frost, and Einstein. Between 1995 and 1998, several of the cathedral's choir and aisle windows were restored by Reflection Studios of Emeryville, California. =Carillon= The carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco dentist and realtor who came from Lostwithiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, he found his way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide bells for the church and eventually spent his life savings to realize his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower to house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and tuned at the Gillett & Johnston Foundry of Croydon, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before the cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from its Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been rung to mark a number of important events, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system. =Cathedral School for Boys= In 1957, Cathedral School for Boys was opened in the Cathedral's bell towers. It was founded by Grace Cathedral Dean Julian Bartlett, in response to parents seeking an alternative to the other private schools in San Francisco. A permanent building was opened in June 1965, forming part of the cathedral close. Thanks in part to the presence of the school, the cathedral has one of only a handful of remaining Episcopal men and boys cathedral choirs, the Grace Cathedral Choir of Men and Boys; the 24 boys of the choir attend the Cathedral School for Boys, while the 12 men are a professional ensemble. In popular culture Grace Cathedral front fa√ßade Photographer Ansel Adams produced a series of photographs of the incomplete cathedral in 1935. \\"Grace Cathedral Park\\" is the first song on Red House Painters' first self-titled album. \\"Grace Cathedral Hill\\" is track 7 on The Decemberists' Castaways and Cutouts album. It recounts a New Year's Eve experience in which the singer and his sullen (presumably grieving) female companion visit the church to light candles. Grace Cathedral has appeared in a number of feature films over the years. Alfred Hitchcock filmed an abduction scene for his final film, Family Plot, in the cathedral in 1975. Some other film appearances include: The Pleasure of His Company (1961), Bullitt (1968), 'Time After Time' (1979), Bicentennial Man (1999), and Milk (2008). The short epilogue of the 1962 film How the West Was Won shows sweeping views of how the West had evolved into its modern self, including an aerial shot of San Francisco that flies directly over Grace Cathedral, showing some of its ongoing construction. Jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi composed and recorded a mass for jazz trio and choir. The performance at the cathedral on May 21, 1965 was released as At Grace Cathedral. Duke Ellington performed his televised Concert of Sacred Music at the cathedral on September 26, 1965. Bay Area local resident, Greg Kihn and the Greg Kihn Band, a popular rock group of the 1980s, filmed some of their MTV \\"Jeopardy\\" video inside Grace Cathedral in 1983. Armistead Maupin's iconic Tales of the City series has an Episcopal cannibal cult operating out of Grace Cathedral as one of its sub-plots. In the TV adaptation, Maupin plays a cameo role as a priest of Grace Cathedral, but the cathedral interiors were actually filmed in Montreal.

Each contour line can be defined as a closed line joining relief points at equal height above sea level. It is usually drawn on the same horizontal scale as the map, but the use of an exaggerated vertical scale is advisable to underline the elements of the relief. This can vary according to the slope and amplitude of the terrestrial relief, but is usually three to five times the horizontal scale. A series of parallel profiles, taken at regular intervals on a map, can be combined to provide a more complete three-dimensional view of the area that appears on the topographic map. It is evident that, thanks to computer science, more sophisticated three-dimensional models of the landscape can be made from digital terrain data. The line of the plane defined by the points that limit the profile is called the guideline and the horizontal line of comparison on which the profile is constructed is called base. Applications One of the most important applications of the topographic profiles is in the construction of works of great length and small width, for example roads, sewers or pipelines. Sometimes topographical profiles appear in printed maps, such as those designed for navigation routes, excavations and especially for geological maps, where they are used to show the internal structure of the rocks that populate a territory. People who study natural resources such as geologists, geomorphologists, soil scientists and vegetation scholars, among others, build profiles to observe the relationship of natural resources to changes in topography and analyze numerous problems.

Aseptic meningitis is caused by viruses, mycobacteria, spirochetes, fungi, medications, and cancer malignancies. The testing for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis is mostly the same. A cerebrospinal fluid sample is taken by lumbar puncture and is tested for leukocyte levels to determine if there is an infection and goes on to further testing to see what the actual cause is. The symptoms are the same for both meningitis and aseptic meningitis but the severity of the symptoms and the treatment can depend on the certain cause. The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is by viral infection. Other causes may include side- effects from drugs and connective tissue disorders.  Signs and symptoms  Aseptic meningitis is a disease that can depend on the patient‚Äôs age, however research has shown some distinct symptoms that indicate the possibility of aseptic meningitis. A variety of patients notice a change in body temperatures (higher than normal temperatures 38-40¬∞C), marked with the possibility of vomiting, headaches, firm neck pain, and even lack of appetite. In younger patients, like babies, a meningeal inflammation can be noticed along with the possibility of hepatic necrosis and myocarditis. In serious cases, a multiple organ failure can also signal aseptic meningitis and oftentimes, in babies, seizures and focal neurological deficits can be early symptoms of aseptic meningitis. In fact, in newborns, the mortality rate is 70%. The next set of age group, like children, have similar but varying symptoms of sore throat, rashes, and diarrhea. In adults, symptoms and the harshness of them tend to be less in duration. Additionally, the probability of developing aseptic meningitis increases when patients have a case of mumps or herpes. Symptoms of meningitis caused by an acute viral infection last between one and two weeks. When aseptic meningitis is caused by cytomegalovirus 20 percent of individuals face mortality or morbidity. If left untreated it can affect an individuals hearing and learning abilities.  Causes  The most common cause of aseptic meningitis is a viral infection, specifically by enteroviruses. In fact, 90 percent of all meningitis cases that are viral are caused by enteroviruses. Other viruses that may cause aseptic meningitis are varicella zoster virus, herpes, and mumps. Other causes may include mycobacteria, fungi, spirochetes, and complications from HIV. Side effects of certain drugs such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin), and antiepileptic drugs can also cause aseptic meningitis. There are multiple types of aseptic meningitis which are differentiated based on its cause. *An example of a mumps infection.Viral meningitis **Enterovirus (EV) caused meningitis. This is the most common cause of viral meningitis, with 90% of viral meningitis cases being caused by EVs. ** Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) **Mumps meningoencephalitis **Mosquito carried viruses of the flavivirus family. Saint Louis encephalitis (SLE) and West Nile virus (WNV) are the most typical. **Specific types of Herpes can result in aseptic meningitis. These are (HSV)-1, (HSV)-2, varicella-zoster virus, and (HHV6). *Bacteria **Lyme disease **Syphilis **Leptospirosis *Fungi **Cryptococcal infection **Coccidioidal infection *Drug-induced aseptic meningitis (DIAM) **Irritation of the meninges from drugs administered directly to the spinal canal or subarachnoid space. The hypersensitivity to the drug results in an immune response. * Autoimmune diseases ** Systemic lupus erythematosus. * Cancer-caused aseptic meningitis such as neoplastic meningitis ** This affects about 5% of all cancer cases, with a predominance in leukemias. *Neurosarcoidosis  Diagnosis  Lumbar puncture procedure for diagnosing aseptic meningitis The term aseptic can be misleading, implying a lack of infection. On the contrary, many cases of aseptic meningitis represent infection with viruses or mycobacteria that cannot be detected with routine methods. Medical professionals will take into consideration the season of the year, the medical history of the individual and family, physical examination, and laboratory results when diagnosing aseptic meningitis. One common medical test used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis is lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid collected from the lumbar puncture is analyzed by microscope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Gram stains, and viral cultures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection. Other laboratory tests include blood, urine, and stool collection. Medical professionals also have the option of performing a computed tomographic (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tests help observe calcifications or abscesses.  Treatment  If CSF levels are irregular among individuals, they will undergo hospitalization where they receive antiviral therapy. If aseptic meningitis was caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV), the individual will receive acyclovir, an antiviral drug. If infants are diagnosed, medical professionals will order regular check-ins for hearing and learning disabilities.  History  Aseptic meningitis was first described by Wallgren in 1925. Aseptic meningitis cases have varied historically. Aseptic meningitis caused by mumps has declined in the United States due to the increased use of vaccination which prevents mumps cases from occurring.

The largest category of diagnosis by exclusion is seen among psychiatric disorders where the presence of physical or organic disease must be excluded as a prerequisite for making a functional diagnosis.

When the defense is asserted, the factfinder, usually a jury, must decide the degree to which the plaintiff's negligence and the combined negligence of all other relevant actors all contributed to cause the plaintiff's damages. It is a modification of the doctrine of contributory negligence that disallows any recovery by a plaintiff whose negligence contributed even minimally to causing the damages.  Explanation  Prior to the late 1960s, only a few states had adopted the system. When comparative negligence was adopted, three main versions were used. The first was called \\"pure\\" comparative negligence. A plaintiff who was 90% to blame for an accident could recover 10% of his losses. (Of course, defendants who suffered injuries in such a case could counter claim and recover 90% of losses from the other party.) The second and third versions are lumped together in what is called \\"modified\\" comparative negligence. One variant allows plaintiffs to recover \\"only\\" if the plaintiff's negligence is \\"not greater than\\" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must not be more than 50% of the combined negligence of both parties). The other variant allows plaintiffs to recover \\"only if\\" the plaintiff's negligence is \\"not as great as\\" the defendant's (the plaintiff's negligence must be less than 50% of the combined negligence). The apparently minor difference between the two modified forms of comparative negligence is thought by lawyers handling such cases to be significant, as juries who ordinarily assign degrees of fault are much less willing to award damages to a plaintiff who is equally at fault than to one who is less at fault than the defendant.  Contributory negligence doctrine  Some states, though, still use the contributory negligence doctrine to evaluate negligence in a tort. For instance, Alabama, Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia continue to use contributory negligence. Neither comparative negligence nor contributory negligence should be confused with joint and several liability, which generally holds each of two or more culpable defendants responsible for all the damages sustained by a plaintiff. For practical reasons, a plaintiff who faces the defense of comparative negligence may wish to join all potentially culpable defendants in his action since the plaintiff's negligence will be balanced against the combined negligence of all defendants in apportioning damages even if the plaintiff may not be able actually to get compensation from some of them: for example, if an insolvent individual and a major corporation were both negligent in causing plaintiff's harm.

CFRP is the largest research park in Florida, the fourth largest in the United States by number of companies, and the seventh largest in the United States by number of employees. CFRP is home to numerous centers hosted by the United States Department of Defense, UCF, and private corporations. Park The Park was established as a result of legislation passed by the Florida Legislature in 1978, and is a cooperative effort between the University of Central Florida, the Orange County Research and Development Authority, and the Orange County Board of County Commissioners. The governing body of the Park is the Orange County Research and Development Authority. The university and officials of CFRP believe that the potential for the establishment of close ties between the university and industry will create an attractive environment conducive to the location of research-oriented industry in the Park. This activity will enrich and support the academic, teaching, and research programs of the university. Businesses can purchase or lease land in the park on which to construct a facility or can lease space for office, lab, or light manufacturing activities. Planned to provide a campus-like environment for business adjacent to UCF, the CFRP covers over , directly south of UCF's main campus in Orlando. Located approximately northeast of downtown Orlando and southwest of Daytona Beach, the park was built to supplement the university's goal of providing highly trained personnel to support the Kennedy Space Center and NASA, which is located only to the east. Partnerships Significant organizations, including the Institute for Simulation and Training, National Center for Simulation, Team Orlando, and the National Center for Forensic Science, are located in the Research Park. Given the importance of simulation and training to the Department of Defense, an extensive military presence is also located in the park centered on the Orlando area's last remaining active duty military installation, Naval Support Activity Orlando. Tenant commands at NSA Orlando include the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), the US Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Research, Development and Engineering Command United States Army Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC), Marine Corps Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS), and the Air Force Agency for Modeling and Simulation (AFAMS).

It began life as the Victoria Amateur Turf Club, in 1875 with Mr. E.C. Moore as the club's first Secretary. The Dowling Forest Racecourse in Ballarat was the location for the first VATC race meeting on Friday, 24 March 1876. Within six months the VATC were granted use of Crown land at Caulfield as a permanent home in Melbourne. History and race meetings In 1879, the club staged the first running of the Caulfield Cup, and two years later, introduced the Caulfield Guineas and the Toorak Handicap. In addition the Caulfield Cup was switched to the spring racing season and became the lead up race to the Melbourne Cup. The Futurity Stakes was added to the racing calendar in 1898. The Club suffered the loss of the Members' Stand in 1922 when it was destroyed by fire, and five years later the Guineas Stand was also burnt down. The military occupied Caulfield Racecourse in 1940 for a period of four years when it became a depot and barracks for army recruits during the Second World War. The then Vice-President of the United States, Richard Nixon attended the Caulfield Cup meeting in 1953. In 1963 the Melbourne Racing Club, which had been created from an amalgamation of the Williamstown Racing Club and the Victorian Racing and Trotting Association, was incorporated into the VATC. Following the merger, the newest of Melbourne's race tracks, Sandown Racecourse, was opened on 19 June 1965 in front of a crowd of over 52,000. The first Blue Diamond Stakes, a race for 2-year-olds, was run at Caulfield in 1971 and won by Tolerance. The glass- fronted Rupert Clarke Grandstand, which replaced the main Caulfield grandstand of the 1920s, was opened in 1992. With the increase in the number of visiting international horses to the Melbourne Spring Racing Carnival a permanent Quarantine Centre was established by the VATC at Sandown Racecourse in 1997. In 2001 the Club commenced a five-year, $20 million, strategic plan which included the establishment of 20 feature race days at Caulfield; construction of a second turf track at Sandown to be known as Hillside, with the existing circuit being renamed Lakeside; a major upgrade of facilities and training tracks at Caulfield; and the change of club name from Victoria Amateur Turf Club to Melbourne Racing Club. Jumps racing is conducted at the Sandown track during the winter months, the blue ribbon events being the Australian Steeple and the Australian Hurdle.

Birkenstock Orthop√§die GmbH & Co. KG is a German shoe manufacturer headquartered in Neustadt (Wied), Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The company sells Birkenstocks, a German brand of sandals, and other shoes notable for their contoured cork and rubber footbeds (soles), which conform somewhat to the shape of their wearers' feet. History The Birkenstock brand traces its roots to Johann Adam Birkenstock, registered in 1774 as a \\"vassal and shoemaker\\" in local church archives in the small Hessian village of Langen- Bergheim. In 1896, Johann's great-great-grandson Konrad Birkenstock developed the first contoured insole for use by shoemakers in the production of custom footwear. Also in the year 1896 Karl opened two shoe stores in Frankfurt, Germany where he continued to make and sell his insoles. 1902 saw the development of the first flexible arch-support for insertion into factory-made shoes; and in 1964, Karl Birkenstock developed these inserts into a shoe ‚Äî thus producing the original prototype of the Birkenstock sandal. In 1925 Konrad Birkenstock expanded the company by buying a large factory in Friedberg, Hesse. After World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the Birkenstock sandal was popular among returning soldiers because of the orthopedic support. Starting in 1963 and continuing into 1964 Karl Birkenstock released his first athletic sandal with a flexible footbed called Madrid. It soon became popular, especially among gymnasts. In 1966, Birkenstocks were introduced in the United States, as well as elsewhere. The American Margot Fraser \\"discovered\\" Birkenstock sandals while visiting a spa in Germany. She gained relief from a foot condition, and founded a trading company called Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, Inc., in Novato, California, based on her enthusiasm for the sandals. Renamed Birkenstock Distribution USA, Inc., in 2005, the company remained until 2007 the exclusive importer and distributor of Birkenstock name-brand products in the United States. In 2007 the owners of Birkenstock Orthop√§die GmbH & Co. KG purchased their long-standing distribution partner Birkenstock Distribution USA, Inc. (BDUSA). When Margot Fraser first started distributing them in San Francisco, California, she was unsuccessful. Later on in the 1970s a cultural revolution improved her business. In the United States, Birkenstock first became popular among young men and later on among flower children, a group traditionally associated with American liberalism. The shoe became popular with hippies and others who had a \\"back to nature\\" philosophy and appreciated the natural foot shape and foot-friendly comfort of Birkenstocks.Carr, Collie (12 March 2006). \\"Thank You for Insulting Our Sandals\\".

At the top of Murchison Falls, the Nile forces its way through a gap in the rocks, only wide, and tumbles , before flowing westward into Lake Albert. The outlet of Lake Victoria sends around 300 cubic meters per second (11,000 ft¬≥/s) of water over the falls, squeezed into a gorge less than wide. Samuel Baker and Florence Baker were the first Europeans who sighted them. Baker named them after Roderick Murchison, the President of the Royal Geographical Society. The falls lend their name to the surrounding Murchison Falls National Park. During the regime of Idi Amin in the 1970s, the name was changed to Kabalega Falls, after the Omukama (King) Kabalega of Bunyoro, although this was never legally promulgated. The name reverted to Murchison Falls following the downfall of Idi Amin. It is still sometimes referred to as Kabalega Falls. Ernest Hemingway crashed a plane just downriver from Murchison Falls in 1954. In August 2019, Uganda rejected a hydropower project by South Africa‚Äôs Bonang Power and Energy.

With Havoc, he was one half of the hip hop duo Mobb Deep. Early life Prodigy was born on November 2, 1974, in Hempstead, New York, on Long Island. He was raised in Queens, New York. He had one elder brother, Greg Johnson. He came from a musical family. His grandfather Budd Johnson was a saxophonist, and his grand- uncle, Keg Johnson, was a trombonist. Both of them are remembered for their contributions to the bebop era of jazz. His mother, Fatima Frances (Collins) Johnson,Blisteen, Jon. Mobb Deep Rapper Prodigy Dead at 42. Rolling Stone.

His great-great-great- grandfather, William Jefferson White, founded Georgia's Morehouse College. Prodigy grew up in LeFrak. While attending the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan, he met his future music partner, Havoc. The duo became the \\"Poetical Prophets\\", before choosing the name \\"The Infamous Mobb Deep\\". Under the alias Lord-T (The Golden Child), the then 16-year-old Johnson joined Jive Records and landed an uncredited guest appearance on the Boyz n the Hood soundtrack, for his collaborative efforts on the song \\"Too Young\\" by Hi-Five in 1991. Music career1995‚Äì1999: The Infamous, Hell on Earth and Murda Muzik= Initially compared to fellow rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his Illmatic album from 1994, Mobb Deep released The Infamous in 1995, which was certified Gold by the RIAA within the first two months of its release. 1995 was also the year that Prodigy began to raise his solo profile, by providing a guest appearance on LL Cool J's controversial \\"I Shot Ya (remix)\\". The song became a minor part of the East Coast‚ÄìWest Coast hip hop rivalry, due to Tupac Shakur believing the song to be a diss referring to his robbery/shooting in Manhattan, New York at Quad Recording Studios - singling out the song's title (which many assumed was connected to Biggie's \\"Who Shot Ya?\\"), certain lyrics, and the timing of its release - the year after the shooting incident. Although the track was stated by Keith Murray to not have any lyrical shots aimed at Tupac, Mobb Deep responded in the following year to Tupac's \\"Hit Em Up\\" with \\"Drop a Gem on 'Em,\\" a promotional single from their 1996 album Hell On Earth. Ironically, \\"I Shot Ya\\" does feature a subliminal aim in Prodigy's verse to Murray, which continued friction that started sometime prior with an interlude from Mobb Deep's 1995 The Infamous album. The rivalry continued until sometime in 2012, when the two ended it by taking a picture together. A year and a half later, at the end of 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released Hell on Earth, which debuted at number six on SoundScan. Their next release, Murda Muzik, was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking, onto the streets and over the internet, rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded. =2000‚Äì2006: H.N.I.C.= In November 2000, Prodigy released his debut solo album H.N.I.C. His followup solo album would be released in 2008.

Pt. 2 through Voxonic Inc., a company in which he was an equity holder.What Would You Do by Laura Checkoway. XXL Magazine. January 2008 In late 2009, Mobb Deep was released from their contract with 50 Cent's G-Unit label.

FeudsWest Coast= From 1995 to 1997, the media-fueled \\"East Coast- West Coast hip hop rivalry\\" was occurring. This started when Tha Dogg Pound released \\"New York, New York,\\" to which Mobb Deep took offense, as, in addition to the lyrics, the song's music video portrayed New York buildings being stomped on by Dogg Pound members. In response, Mobb Deep with Capone-N- Noreaga and Tragedy Khadafi released \\"LA, LA\\". 2Pac \\"dissed\\" Mobb Deep (along with The Notorious B.I.G.) in \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" where, in the outro of the song, he made a remark in clear reference to Prodigy's ailment in having sickle cell anemia. Mobb Deep responded in a track called \\"Drop A Gem On 'Em\\" which was released as a single 2 weeks before 2Pac was murdered. 2Pac also dissed Mobb Deep on the song \\"Against All Odds\\" and \\"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\\" which were released after his death. But Prodigy later sampled 2Pac's voice from a freestyle for the chorus on the song \\"Return of the Mac\\" (a.k.a. \\"New York Shit\\") on his album with the same name. =Def Squad= On The Infamous track \\"The Infamous Prelude\\", Prodigy made remarks about rappers who rap about \\"smoking weed\\" and talk about \\"space shit\\". Def Squad took offense from this, but the feud was settled when Prodigy and Keith Murray met at a video shoot. The feud was rekindled when Prodigy again referenced \\"space shit\\" in his appearance on LL Cool J's \\"I Shot Ya\\" which also featured Murray. Murray saw Prodigy at a club one night and punched him. Prodigy recalled the altercation and threatened Murray in the song \\"In the Long Run\\" on Hell on Earth. Murray released a song \\"Call My Name\\" on his Enigma album dissing Mobb Deep. The feud seemed to die down until Prodigy dissed Murray again in his 2004 song \\"Bad Blood.\\" Murray has responded with numerous songs since. The feud has since died down, with the two sharing a photograph together with Busta Rhymes on social media. On Twitter, The reconciliation was confirmed by Prodigy in response to the photo not long after. =Saigon= During an interview, Prodigy stated that he did not like Saigon and Tru-Life (along with many other rappers).

March 23, 2013 Illuminati theory Some rap music has been inspired by the theory that a powerful international secret society exists. Often it is referred to as the Illuminati, after the Bavarian secret society founded in 1776. Complex magazine has claimed it was Prodigy who started the interest in the theory. Prodigy had often spoken publicly against the alleged international secret society during his life. Prodigy rapped about a secret society in his collaboration with LL Cool J in the song \\"I Shot Ya (Remix)\\", from the 1995 album Mr. Smith. From prison in 2007, not long before the release of H.N.I.C. Part 2, Prodigy wrote and published an \\"open letter\\" to Jay-Z in which he made some cryptic allegations alluding to the theory. In 2008, Prodigy titled a song \\"Illuminati\\", from H.N.I.C. Part 2. In his final solo album released during his life, The Hegelian Dialectic (2017), Prodigy also referred to the theory. It was reported that Prodigy was working on a musical about his Illuminati theory at the time of his death. Illness and death In an interview with Vibe in November 2000, Prodigy spoke about what inspired him to directly address his battle with sickle-cell anemia in his song \\"You Can Never Feel My Pain\\", from his debut studio album H.N.I.C. He attributed his nihilism to the \\"permanent physical suffering\\" caused by his lifelong battle with the condition. On June 20, 2017, it was reported that Prodigy had died at the Spring Valley Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, while hospitalized for complications related to his sickle-cell anemia. He was performing in the Art of Rap Tour in Las Vegas with Havoc, Ghostface Killah, Onyx, KRS-One, and Ice-T when he was hospitalized. According to a coroner's report, Prodigy was admitted to Spring Valley Medical Center after suffering a significant medical episode arising from his life-long battle with sickle-cell anemia. Days later, on the morning of June 20, he was found unresponsive by hospital staff. It was reported at the time that Prodigy died from accidental choking. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of the family by the Gage Law Firm, alleges that the Spring Valley hospital breached their duty of care for Prodigy by \\"failing to maintain a working IV access,\\" and by \\"failing to continuously monitor oxygen levels\\" as ordered by physicians in the hospital, and that those failures led to Prodigy's death.

A right-hand batter and occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Merchant played first-class cricket for Bombay cricket team as well as 10 Test matches for India between 1929 and 1951. Behind his limited Test appearances, he dominated Indian domestic cricket ‚Äì his batting average of 71.64 is the second highest first-class average in history, behind only that of Don Bradman. He is regarded as the founder of the Bombay School of Batsmanship, that placed more importance on right technique, steely temperament, and conservative approach rather than free flow of the bat, a tradition broken and remoulded only after the arrival of Sachin Tendulkar. His international career included two tours of England upon which he scored over 800 runs. English cricketer C. B. Fry exclaimed \\"Let us paint him white and take him with us to Australia as an opener.\\" His brother, Uday, also played first-class cricket. Besides cricket, he was also associated with the Hindoostan Spinning & Weaving Mills (Thakersey Group). Domestic Cricket Merchant was born in Bombay, into a wealthy family in 1911. He was an \\"outstanding college cricketer\\" who captained Sydenham College, while studying there; his success for Sydenham led to selection for Hindus cricket team during the 1929 Bombay Quadrangular. He also continued to play for Sydenham and in 1931 he set the record in Bombay inter-collegiate cricket by scoring 504 runs and taking 29 wickets. His continued success in domestic cricket resulted in the call to the India national team to play against the visiting English team at Bombay Gymkhana, which was also the first Test to be played on Indian soil. Throughout his career, Merchant was involved in a rivalry with the other great Indian batsman of the era, Vijay Hazare. In the Bombay Pentangular match against the Rest, he bested Hazare's record of 242, set just in the previous match against the Muslims, with 250 not out. Hazare responded with a 309 out of a team total of 387 in the next innings, in what is generally held the greatest innings ever played in India before 1947. Merchant topped it by scoring 359 against Maharashtra in Ranji trophy. International career Merchant's Test career spanned 18 years but during that time he played only ten Test matches, and was unfortunate that some of the best years of his career were lost to the Second World War, when no international cricket was played. He also missed tours to Australia and the West Indies due to poor health. However, Merchant went out to score 154 in his last Test match against England in Delhi, which was also his highest Test score. A shoulder injury incurred while fielding in that game forced him to retire. All ten matches of Merchant's Test career were against England. Merchant had a particularly successful England tour of 1946. Despite facing difficulty against swing bowling when the ball moved away after pitching on the leg stump, he scored 2,385 runs including seven centuries in the 41 innings he batted, at an average of 74.53. In his column, former cricketer Learie Constantine wrote, \\"... this (Merchant) world-beater so adapted himself to the circumstances that he produced cricket of the highest class, never refusing the challenge to score when the dice was not too heavily loaded against the side.\\" Merchant went on to become a cricket administrator, broadcaster, writer and national selector, and charitable advocate of the handicapped. Cricket with Vijay Merchant \\"Cricket with Vijay Merchant\\" was a radio programme hosted by Merchant. It was broadcast on Sunday afternoons, on Vividh Bharati, Anu D. Aggarwal quotes a survey, which revealed that it was one of the most listened to sponsored programmes. Legacy Although Vijay Merchant played only ten Test matches, he is widely considered to be one of the greatest batmen of his era. He was an attractive stroke maker, who \\"developed fine footwork, and built a stroke repertoire featuring a lovely cut, grasscutting drives, a delicate glance and late-cut, and, until later in his career, a brilliant hook stroke.\\" His batting average in first-class cricket was 71.64, putting him second only to Don Bradman of Australia. In India's domestic Ranji Trophy matches, he fared even better, averaging 98.75 in 47 innings. His record is especially impressive as his runs came at a time of uncovered wickets. Merchant was one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1937. Vijay Merchant is also the oldest Indian player to score a Test century. He scored 154 when he was 40 years 21 days in India vs England match in 1951‚Äì52 series. During his career, he scored eleven double-centuries in first-class cricket, the most by an Indian batsman. The record stood until November 2017, when Cheteshwar Pujara scored his twelfth double-century batting for Saurashtra against Jharkhand in the 2017‚Äì18 Ranji Trophy.

A variant of peg solitaire, it takes place on an infinite checkerboard. The board is divided by a horizontal line that extends indefinitely. Above the line are empty cells and below the line are an arbitrary number of game pieces, or \\"soldiers\\". As in peg solitaire, a move consists of one soldier jumping over an adjacent soldier into an empty cell, vertically or horizontally (but not diagonally), and removing the soldier which was jumped over. The goal of the puzzle is to place a soldier as far above the horizontal line as possible. Arrangements of Conway's soldiers to reach rows 1, 2, 3 and 4. The men marked \\"B\\" represent an alternative to those marked \\"A\\". Conway proved that, regardless of the strategy used, there is no finite sequence of moves that will allow a soldier to advance more than four rows above the horizontal line. His argument uses a carefully chosen weighting of cells (involving the golden ratio), and he proved that the total weight can only decrease or remain constant. This argument has been reproduced in a number of popular math books. Simon Tatham and Gareth Taylor have shown that the fifth row can be reached via an infinite series of moves. If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can be reached, but not the 9th row. It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can be reached is 3n-2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot be reached. It is considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 can be reached. Conway's proof that the fifth row is inaccessibleNotation and definitions= Define \\\\varphi = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{5}-1}{2} \\\\approx 0.61803\\\\,39887\\\\ldots. (In other words, \\\\varphi here denotes the reciprocal of the golden ratio.) Observe that \\\\varphi^2 = 1 - \\\\varphi. Let the target square be labeled with the value \\\\varphi^0 = 1, and all other squares be labeled with the value \\\\varphi^n, where n is the Manhattan distance to the target square. Then we can compute the \\"score\\" of a configuration of soldiers by summing the values of the soldiers' squares. For example, a configuration of only two soldiers placed so as to reach the target square on the next jump would have score \\\\varphi^1 + \\\\varphi^2. When a soldier jumps over another soldier, there are three cases to consider: # When a soldier jumps towards the target square: Let the value of the soldier's square be \\\\varphi^n for some n, and the value of the square he jumps over be \\\\varphi^{n-1}; then the total change in score after the jump is \\\\varphi^{n-2} - \\\\varphi^{n-1} - \\\\varphi^n = \\\\varphi^{n-2}(1 - \\\\varphi - \\\\varphi^2) = 0. # When a soldier remains the same distance from the target square after his jump: In this case the change in score is \\\\varphi^n - \\\\varphi^{n-1} - \\\\varphi^n = -\\\\varphi^{n-1}. # When a soldier jumps away from the target square: Here the change in score is \\\\varphi^{n+2} - \\\\varphi^{n+1} - \\\\varphi^n = \\\\varphi^n(\\\\varphi^2 - \\\\varphi - 1) = -2\\\\varphi^{n+1}. So, no jump will ever increase the configuration's total score. =Computing the score of the initial configuration= Consider now a starting configuration where only one infinite horizontal line is completely filled with soldiers. If this horizontal line of soldiers is immediately below the target square, then the score of the configuration is \\\\varphi + 2\\\\varphi^2 + 2\\\\varphi^3 + \\\\ldots. The score of a line two spaces below the target square is \\\\varphi^2 + 2\\\\varphi^3 + 2\\\\varphi^4 + \\\\ldots = \\\\varphi(\\\\varphi + 2\\\\varphi^2 + 2\\\\varphi^3 + \\\\ldots). The score of a line three spaces below is \\\\varphi^2(\\\\varphi + 2\\\\varphi^2 + 2\\\\varphi^3 + \\\\ldots). And so on. Consider the full starting configuration, where soldiers fill the whole half-plane below the red line. This configuration's score is the sum of the scores of the individual lines. Therefore, if the target square is immediately above the red line, the score is :S_1 = (\\\\varphi + 2(\\\\varphi^2 + \\\\varphi^3 + \\\\varphi^4 \\\\ldots))(1 + \\\\varphi + \\\\varphi^2 + \\\\varphi^3 + \\\\ldots). At this point, observe another interesting property of \\\\varphi, namely that \\\\sum_{n=2}^{\\\\infty}\\\\varphi^n = 1. Applying this identity produces :S_1 = (\\\\varphi + 2)(1 + \\\\varphi + 1) = (\\\\varphi + 2)^2 = 5 + 3\\\\varphi \\\\approx 6.85410\\\\ldots. If the target square is in the second row above the red line, every soldier is one space further from the target square, and so the score is :S_2 = \\\\varphi S_1 = 2 + 2\\\\varphi. Similarly: :S_3 = \\\\varphi S_2 = 2 + \\\\varphi, :S_4 = \\\\varphi S_3 = 1 + \\\\varphi, :S_5 = \\\\varphi S_4 = 1. When a soldier reaches the target square after some finite number of moves, the ending configuration has score E = \\\\varphi^0 + \\\\epsilon, where \\\\varphi^0 represents the contribution of the soldier on the target square and \\\\epsilon represents the (small, but positive) contributions of the infinite number of soldiers that remain elsewhere on the plane. Thus, we have shown that when the target square is in the fifth row above the infinite half-plane of soldiers, the starting configuration's score is exactly S_5 = 1; the ending configuration's score is E = 1+\\\\epsilon; and since no kind of jump ever increases the score, we must have S_5\\\\ge E. This is a contradiction; Q.E.D., it is impossible for any soldier to reach a square in the fifth row after a finite number of jumps. References * E. Berlekamp, J. Conway and R.

Slawi is known for the production of a particularly fragrant black tea and the tea drinking culture known as Moci. Geography Unusual for a tea-producing area, Slawi has a warm climate with a gentle sloping geography. Slawi is located about 20 km south of Tegal at the central north coast of Java in Central Java province. It is bordered by Adiwerna (Banjaran) district to the north, the Pangkah district to the east, the Balapulang district to the south and the Jatibarang district (located in the administrative area of Brebes Regency) to the west. Society and culture The majority of citizens work as farmers, in the metal industry, the public service, or in a variety of home industries, including teak furniture-making and weaving sarongs. As generally the case with 'urbanisation', many young people leave the area after high school, heading for larger urban centres such as Jakarta, Bandung, Semarang and some timber processing towns such as Banjarmasin and Balikpapan. In the last three decades, some are working overseas in places such as Middle East, Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Their financial remittances are an important source of income for the area. The out of town family members would generally return to Slawi for the Moslem holidays of Idul Fitri as a tradition. Local crafts include traditional forms of batik and metal working, and Wayang Kulit puppet shows are also performed. The local language of the area is Javanese, spoken with a distinctive regional accent. The local cuisine lists among others, Tahu Aci, fried tofu triangle with one side filled with cassava flour - represent the best vegetarian fried tofu among Asian cuisine. Sega Lengko, made of boiled and steamed rice adorned with fermented soybean cake pieces tempeh, tofu, soy- bean sprouts tauge, sand-fried peanuts and some hand crushed krupuk aci (cassava flour crackers) and/or krupuk udang (prawn crackers), fried shallots with mild chili peanut sauce over the top prior to serving. There is also variety of chicken turmeric soup, Soto Tegal, and Sate Tegal. There are many local food stalls, called Warteg (Warung Tegal), which offer daily meals at affordable prices for all walks of life. Tea drinking at the small or large eatery has a famous local term called Moci - literally tea drinking from one small clay teapot with one teacup for each person. It is the way to drink the locally produced fragrant jasmine black tea. The teapot is filled with a small paper bag the size of matchbox full of jasmine tea and poured with slightly scalding hot water. The brewed tea is then poured into a clay teacup with rock sugar. The way the locals do is not to stir avoiding average sweetness, drink while it is hot preferably with some slurping noise as well. Some will pour it on the saucer and slurp it with abandon pleasure. The idea is to get to the last slurp or sip when it is sweetest and in this way encouraging refill. It somewhat reflects the Malay pantun proverb, 'berakit-rakit ke hulu/berenang- renang ke tepian/ bersakit-sakit dahulu/bersenang-senang kemudian', meaning there is a satisfying end to a difficult beginning. Not to be mistaken with the way the Russian drink their tea, by holding the rock sugar between the teeth and sip the tea. Moci is frequently accompanied by Mendoan, a moist fermented soybean cake (tempe or tempeh) fried in wheat fluor batter, often eaten with sambal ulek (oelek) or plain chilli paste or simply bite into one bird's eye chilli then bite a piece off the tempe. This is a favourite drink while enjoying the famous Sate Tegal, sate of local goat meat. Local areas of interest There are several beaches within easy reach of Slawi, as well as Guci, an area of waterfalls, gardens, and public hot springs at the foot of Slamet Mountain, approximately 27 km south of Slawi. In addition, nearby Alun Alun Kabupaten Slawi is a garden with a large fountain that is popular on Sundays. In the town itself, there are the old and new markets, the Singa and Rama theatres, as well as the historical Pankah Sugar Factory, and the 4th Slawi Primary School, both of which are part of the Dutch colonial legacy in the city.

Biography  He was born to a pious family in 1910 in the village of Kobylino, Kaluga Governorate, in the town of Bogorodsk near Moscow. On December 5, 1925, he became a monk at Sretensky Monastery in Moscow. He spent years in various Russian monasteries and cathedrals, in Murom, Odessa and Pskov. In 1954 Pimen became namestnik (alderman) of Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. On November 17, 1957, in Odessa, he was consecrated bishop of Balta, vicar of the Diocese of Odessa. Beginning December 26, 1957, he was bishop of Dmitrov, vicar of the Moscow diocese. From July 1960 to November 14, 1961, he was Chancellor of the Moscow Patriarchate. On November 23, 1960, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. On March 16, 1961, he became archbishop of Tula and Belyov. On November 14, 1961, he was appointed Metropolitan of Leningrad and Ladoga. After the death of Patriarch Alexius I in 1970, Metropolitan Pimen was chosen Patriarchal Locum Tenens, essentially a temporary replacement. Because 1970 was the centennial of Lenin's birth, Soviet authorities did not want a church council to select a new Patriarch during that year. A Local Council was opened May 30, 1971. On June 2, 1971, the final day of the Council, Metropolitan Pimen was elected Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia. He was enthroned on June 3 of that year. (The other important act of the Council was the abolition of the \\"oath\\" on the old rites from the Great Moscow Council of 1667.) Pimen's task was to lead a Christian church in a state ruled by an officially atheist Communist party. In his post, he worked closely with the Communist authorities, participating in numerous \\"peace movement\\" conferences sponsored by the government. Pimen was awarded the Soviet Peace Fund Medal (1969, 1971) and, in 1970, the Gold Medal \\"–ë–æ—Ä—Ü—É –∑–∞ –º–∏—Ä\\" (\\"Fighter for Peace\\") by the 'Soviet Committee for the Defence of Peace'. Pimen was a member of the World Peace Council from 1963 onwards. In 1961, Pimen was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour (–æ—Ä–¥–µ–Ω –¢—Ä—É–¥–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ó–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏), one of the highest awards of the time. Near the end of his difficult term as head of the Russian Orthodox Church, he organized the celebration of the 1000th anniversary of the Christianization of Rus' in 1988. This event coincided with political reforms that ended much of the Communist party's anti-religious activity, and the church celebration was seen as marking the end of the persecution of Orthodox Christianity in the Soviet Union. When Patriarch Pimen died in 1990, the government made no effort to influence the choice of his successor.

It is located on Highway 690, approximately east of the Mackenzie Highway (Highway 35), north of Peace River and southeast of Manning.  History  John Chauncey Eggenberger was the first postmaster and proprietor of the first general store. He was from Deadwood, South Dakota. It seems that he named the hamlet after his home town. The original store, post office and community hall were located a few miles west of the present day hamlet. On Saturday, August 19, 2006 in the evening (with a number of people gathered for the Deadwood Days ball tournament watching) a single- engine Cessna 177 piloted by Manning businessman Nick Gudzinski, 49, crashed less than a kilometre south of the hamlet. The pilot and all three of the teenaged passengers were killed. All were residents of the Manning area some 21 kilometres northwest of Deadwood. One of the passengers was Mr. Gudzinski's son; another was his son's girlfriend, and the remaining was the girlfriend's brother.  Amenities  The hamlet consists of a community hall, baseball diamond, post office, small store, and several houses. The post office, store \\"School Daze\\" and pool room are all contained within the building that was the Deadwood School. The Deadwood United Church continues as an active preaching point of the Manning-Deadwood Shared Ministry. At one time there was a service station, blacksmith shop and at least one other church. Deadwood had a number of baseball teams in the 1950s and early 1960s and competed in the Mackenzie Highway Baseball League against a number of other teams in the area.  Events  Annual community events have included: *\\"Deadwood Days\\" in the summer with a softball tournament, and sometimes a parade and a very small fair; *\\"The Fall Supper\\" as in many rural communities in North America, is usually held in late October in the community hall; and *\\"Deadwood Talent Night\\" in the spring, held in the community hall, showcasing an eclectic and sometimes astonishing range of talents from the Manning-Deadwood and Dixonville area.

Welcoming of the Nazi German occupation, De Clercq believed it to constitute a chance for the creation of a Diets state, an unprecedented (apart from the medieval Burgundian personal union) Dutch language-based community uniting Flanders, the Netherlands and even the part of northern France with Flemish dialects (corresponding to French Flanders).

It was published for two periods in the 19th century, and was revived in 1929.  Overview  The current newspaper shares its title with a 19th century publication, and claims to be a continuation of the original publication. The first paper to bear the name of Literaturnaya Gazeta was founded by a literary group led by Anton Delvig and Alexander Pushkin, whose profile to this day adorns the paper's masthead. The first issue appeared on January 1, 1830. The paper appeared regularly until June 30, 1831, reappearing in 1840‚Äì1849. Pushkin himself published some of his most famous works in this paper. Literaturnaya Gazeta was the first to publish Gogol, and published works by Baratynsky, Belinsky, Nekrasov and many other Russian authors. After the Russian Revolution, the Soviet literary establishment decided to resume the venture on April 22, 1929, and the paper has been published regularly ever since. From 1929 to 1932, Literaturnaya Gazeta was the official organ of the Federation of Unions of Soviet Writers, which had as its stated aim \\"to foster in the area of creative writing the principle of free competition of the various groupings and tendencies\\". In 1932, however, Literaturnaya Gazeta became the official organ of the Union of Soviet Writers, the government-controlled organization responsible for most literary publication and employment of writers in the USSR. An issue from 1950 A 2005 issue In 1947, the format of Literaturnaya Gazeta was changed from a purely literary publication into a newspaper with political and social content as well. It was published weekly in an edition of sixteen pages, the first \\"thick newspaper\\" in a country where most newspapers were four to eight pages in length. The expanded newspaper not only took on a new look, but also acquired greater influence, becoming one of the most authoritative and influential publications. Though Literaturnaya Gazeta, like all newspapers during the Soviet period, faithfully reflected government policy (both political and literary), it showed, as much as possible, the human face of Soviet society, and was the national paper most likely to \\"push the limits\\" (though those limits were fairly severe). Likely over the limit covering Eastern Siberia in 1958 on October 21st \\"In Defense of Baikal\\" from Frants Taurin appeared, which brought the regional environmental conflict to the national press. The newspaper published stories and poems that were often mundane and unimpressive, but occasionally published poetry and prose of quality. Most interesting to its readers were reports on the international political scene, and especially on cultural life in countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence. Especially popular was the last page of each issue, which contained a variety of satirical articles and cartoons under the rubric \\"Twelve Chairs Club\\" (an allusion to the well-known comic novel by Ilf and Petrov). Under the protective guise of good-natured, constructive satire, various frustrating and unsavory aspects of Soviet life could be discussed that were scarcely acknowledged in other publications. In 1990, with the end of the Soviet Union, the newspaper became an independent collective, and in 1997 formed itself into a publicly traded company.

Low elements take place on the ground or above the ground. High elements are usually constructed in trees or made of utility poles and require a belay for safety. Terminology Adventure Park in a forest Ropes courses are referred to using several different names, including Challenge Courses, Ropes Challenge Courses, Teams Course, and Low Ropes, as well as more idiosyncratic names such as the Challenging Outdoor Personal Experience (Project COPE) course (used by the Boy Scouts of America). An Aerial Adventure Park (or \\"European-Style\\" Adventure Park, Tree-Top Adventure course) has a more recreational purpose. Other related terms include obstacle courses, assault courses and commando courses, although these terms also have slightly different meanings, often more associated with military training than with education and training for the general public. History Two boys climbing on the Palisades Climb Adventure, an indoor rope course at Palisades Mall, West Nyack, New York. It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. Obstacle courses have been used by the military to train soldiers as far back as the ancient Greeks. Those courses, however, were primarily used for the training of extremely fit individuals and not necessarily aimed at the development of unremarkable persons as is common practice on ropes courses today. The use of belay and risk management systems on such courses was limited or often non-existent. Many practitioners cite Georges H√©bert as the originator of the \\"modern\\" ropes course. A French naval officer in the early 1900s, H√©bert developed his own method of physical education, apparatus, and principles to train in what he called the ‚ÄúNatural Method,‚Äù which included the development of physical, moral, and ‚Äúvirile‚Äù qualities in an outdoor environment. Drawing from his naval background, H√©bert patterned some of his obstacles on obstacles found on the decks of ships. ‚ÄúH√©bertism‚Äù grew during and between the World Wars, becoming the standard for physical education training for the French military. Many ropes courses and challenge course programs in French Canada and Europe are still known as H√©bertism courses today. Marble, Colorado, the site of the first Colorado Outward Bound course, has been cited as the location of the first ropes course in the US, although this is highly unlikely. Patterned after a military obstacle course and similar to the course in use at the Outward Bound school in Aberdyfi, Wales, the course was constructed of hemp ropes. Belay systems were minimal or non- existent.Rohnke, Wall, Tait, & Rogers, 2003, p. 4 Ropes courses were adapted for use in an education setting by Project Adventure, Inc. in Hamilton, Massachusetts in 1971. The first course built at the school still stands and is in use today. Modern courses Since the 1980s, ropes course sophistication has evolved considerably. Modern ropes courses incorporate sophisticated belay and safety systems using wire rope, friction devices, and climbing harnesses to manage what before were unmanaged risks. Recent technological advances in pole hardware and climbing equipment along with industry-accepted installation and design practices have greatly reduced the risk to end users and to the natural environment. Modern courses make use of a variety of materials other than trees, including utility poles and steel structures. A recent trend of themed courses has created a whole new genre of challenge course aimed at recreational pay-to-play users. New, mobile high ropes courses (originally designed by Jim Liggett of Ropes Courses, Inc.) and climbing walls built on flat bed trucks have made challenge courses more readily available to the public for recreational purposes and are generating increased publicity. Adventure Park in Bali Adventure Parks with a more recreational-orientation are booming in Europe and awake a great interest in the US and around the globe. They are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: Have fun, Test your Courage and Overcome your Own Fears. In an Adventure Park, the participants independently run a variety of trails of increasing difficulty levels. Each trail consists of several poles or trees that are connected by different acrobatic elements. Types of coursesHigh course= An alpine tower at Warren Wilson College. A high course can be a pre-fabricated, professionally installed course, built of utility poles, cables, and bolts, or it can be a course that is hand-built in a wooded area, where ropes and wire are attached to different trees. Ropes courses can be described as static, dynamic, vertical, and M-Belay. With a static course, participants are attached to an upper wire, belay cable, with lanyards (ropes and carabiners) for safety. If the participant dangles, they will be caught by the wire. Advantages of a static course include needing fewer facilitators, being able to get more participants up on the course at one time, and allowing participants to do multiple elements without having to be lowered and climb back up after each. On a dynamic course, participants are connected to a rope, which someone on the ground will be holding onto and belaying the participant on the course. Participants on a dynamic course remain on a belay the entire time: climbing up to the element, doing the activity, and being lowered to the ground after. A vertical course is very similar to dynamic, except that the element is the climb up. Vertical courses can be: vertical obstacle courses with hanging logs, ladders, and tires or alpine towers with their unique hour-glass shape of activities. The M-Belay is the most complicated of the two, and involves two separate belays. Otherwise, it is very similar to a dynamic course. Usually participants must sign a waiver before being allowed to participate on the course, because of the high risk of injury. Some participants may have a hard time completing the course due to its height and the physical challenge. Courses usually range from 25 feet through 50 feet tall, though some elements can reach upwards of 150 feet plus (as in the redwoods and some jungle courses). In order to climb up onto the course participants usually must climb, such as by using a cargo net or Jacob's Ladder, which could be made of rope, or an artificial climbing wall. = Low course = Low ropes courses consist of a series of real and imaginary obstacles designed to challenge groups and individuals to work together to accomplish a task. The classification of low ropes courses can be further broken into several types of activities:A Facilitator's Guide to Adventure Challenge Programming by Mike Smith and David Brassfield * Cooperative Game, Socialization Activity, Ice- Breaker: a fun activity designed to reduce inhibitions and break down barriers. These activities are often not based on a defined task but on a sequence of events. Users are often placed in positions where they are encouraged to try new things that may place them outside their normal comfort zones. Examples include: name games, people to people, raccoon circle... * Group Initiative: problems involving real and imaginary ground-based obstacles (either natural or constructed) that challenge a group to pool their resources and work together to find solutions. Success is achieved only when all members have contributed to the outcome. Examples include: The Muese, Spider's Web, Carpet Maze, Crocodile Pit, Whale Watch, Peanut Butter River, Ragging River, T.P. Shuffle, Nitro Crossing, and Group Wall * Trust-building games: activities designed to provide members the opportunity to demonstrate their trust in other members of the group through a series of sequenced actions. Examples include: Willows in the Wind and Trust Fall. * Low Ropes Elements: a series of cables, ropes, and obstacles strung between trees or poles, 12 to 18 inches above the ground, low rope elements present tests of physical strength, stamina, agility, balance, and flexibility, and invite participants to confront such emotional issues as the fear of falling, the fear of failure, and the fear of losing control. Risk is managed by group members who assume critical spotting roles. Examples include: Swinging Balance Beam, Triangle Traverse, Tire Swings, and Mohawk Walk. Image:CCOURSE_LOW_ELEMENTS_002.jpgZig Zag Image:CCOURSE LOW ELEMENTS 007.jpgMohawk Walk Image:CCOURSE LOW ELEMENTS 010.jpgThe Wall Purpose Ropes course advocates claim that they meet a number of educational, developmental, and recreational goals. High ropes course and climbing programs generally focus on personal achievements and ask participants to confront their personal fears and anxieties. Challenges may be physical and/or emotional. In certain cases, high element programs involve the development and mastery of technical skills to manage rope belay systems used to secure other climbers as they move through the course. In such cases, outcomes often include exploring the fundamentals of trust, craftsmanship, and coaching. Programs using low ropes course elements or group initiatives are most often designed to explore group interaction, problem-solving, and leadership. Some of the commonly claimed outcomes include enhancement of cooperation, decision making, self confidence, positive risk-taking, social cohesion, trust, self esteem, leadership, goal setting, and teamwork. In addition to these commonly cited benefits, a study published in 2000 in the Journal of Leisure Research found that ropes courses also demonstrate higher-level outcomes, including increases in effectiveness and efficiency, building relationships, developing understanding, setting goals, brainstorming ideas and task accomplishment. The British Royal Marines have an extremely difficult ropes course dubbed the 'Tarzan Assault Course'. To pass the Commando Course, recruits must complete this and other arduous tests consecutively under a strict time limit. Research Despite the rapid development of ropes course programming during the latter part of the 20th century and the increasing sophistication and professionalism in ropes course construction, there remains a lack of clear scientific consensus about the many claimed psychosocial training benefits of ropes course participation.For a bibliography see: The Research & Literature on Challenge Courses compiled by Aram Attarian PhD, North Carolina State University, 2005-02, 88p 540kb pdf See also * Group-dynamic game * Karl Rohnke * Outdoor education * Project Adventure * Adventure therapy References Category:Alternative education Category:Outdoor education Category:Types of climbing eo:Arbaraventurejo fr:Parcours aventure en for√™t it:Parco avventura pl:Park linowy pt:Arborismo ","title":"Ropes course"},{"id":"2018016","text":"Charlie King is an American attorney, politician, and civic leader in New York City.  Education  After graduating from the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, King earned a bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1981, and a Juris Doctor from the New York University Law School in 1987.  Career  King served as the chairman of the Democratic County Committee in New York County. King was a volunteer attorney for the Mollen Commission in the early-1990s, and was a member of the Election Monitoring Committee in South Africa when Nelson Mandela was elected president in 1994. In 1999, he was appointed by President Bill Clinton as the regional director for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) for New York and New Jersey, serving in this post until 2001. King served as the acting Executive Director for National Action Network, Al Sharpton's not-for-profit organization from April 2007 to April 2009. King also represented the witnesses connected to the killing of Sean Bell by the New York City Police Department. In April 2010, King was appointed executive director of the New York State Democratic Committee. King stepped down from the post to work as a lobbyist at Mercury Public Affairs, a political strategy and consulting firm with offices in Washington, D.C., New York City, Albany, New York, and Sacramento, California. King is also a frequent host and guest on Keepin' It Real with Al Sharpton. He remains a staunch ally of Governor Andrew Cuomo. = Runs for elected office = In 1998, King ran for the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor of New York and finished second behind Brighton Town Supervisor Sandra Frankel. In 2002, King again sought New York's Lieutenant Governorship as the running mate of former HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo. He and Cuomo dropped out of the race before the primary and endorsed the ticket of State Comptroller Carl McCall and businessman Dennis Mehiel. The Cuomo‚ÄìKing ticket appeared on the 2002 general election ballot as the nominees of the Liberal Party and received less than 50,000 votes, thereby costing the Party its automatic ballot status. In 2006, King sought New York's Attorney General's office. Andrew Cuomo eventually won the election. King also faced former New York City Public Advocate Mark J. Green, former U.S. Attorney Denise O'Donnell and former White House Staff Secretary Sean Patrick Maloney in the primary. King dropped out a week before the primary election and endorsed Cuomo. He then went on to serve on Cuomo's Transition Team as chair of the Civil Rights Committee.

It is usually due to overfeeding a horse carbohydrates and appears to have a genetic link. Causes and process of ER Beyond a highly probable hereditary factor, there does not seem to be a single cause that triggers ER in horses. Exercise is seen in every case, but exercise is always accompanied by another factor. It is likely that several factors must act together in order to cause an ER attack. Other possible factors include: * The overfeeding of non-structural carbohydrates (grain and pellets, for example) * Poor conditioning or fitness, sudden increase of workload * The work of a horse after a period of rest, if the concentrate ration was not reduced * Electrolyte or mineral imbalances, especially seen with potassium * A deficiency in selenium or vitamin E * Imbalance of hormones, including the reproductive hormones in nervous fillies and mares and thyroid hormones in horses with hypothyroidism * Wet, cold, or windy weather conditions The more factors that are present, the greater the likelihood that the horse will develop ER. However, the most common cause of ER is an imbalance between the animal's diet and his workload, especially when he has a high-grain diet. ER occurs when there is an inadequate flow of blood to the muscles of an exercising horse. The muscle cells, lacking in oxygen, begin to function anaerobically to produce the needed ATP. The anaerobic work creates a buildup of waste products, acid, and heat. This subsequently alters the cell by preventing the cell's enzymes from functioning and the myofilaments from efficiently contracting. The cell membranes may then be damaged if the horse is forced to continue work, which allows muscle enzymes and myoglobin to leak into the bloodstream. The body builds up a store of glycogen from converted carbohydrates in muscle cells. Glycogen, a fuel used by muscles for energy, is depleted during work and restocked when a horse rests. Oxygen-carrying blood metabolizes glycogen, but the blood can not flow fast enough to metabolise the excess stored glycogen. The glycogen that is not metabolized aerobically (by the oxygenated blood) must then be metabolized anaerobically, which then creates the cell waste products and heat, and ER has begun. A horse on a high- grain diet with little work collects more glycogen in its muscles than it can use efficiently when exercise begins, which is why horses on a high-grain diet are more likely to develop ER. Proper conditioning can help prevent ER, as it promotes the growth of capillaries in muscles and the number of enzymes used for energy production in muscle cells. However, improvement in these areas can take several weeks. Thus, ER is more common in horses that are only worked sporadically or lightly, and in horses just beginning an exercise regimen. A common misconception is that ER is caused by the buildup of lactic acid. Lactate is not a waste product for a cell, but a fuel, used when the cell's oxygen supply is insufficient. Lactate does not damage a cell, but is rather a byproduct of the true cause of cell damage: inadequate blood supply and altered cell function. Lactate naturally builds up in an exercising horse without harming the muscle cells, and is metabolized within an hour afterwards. The pain is caused by the inadequate blood flow to the muscle tissue, the inflammation from the resulting cell damage, and the release of cell contents. Muscle spasms, caused by the lack of blood to the muscle tissue, are also painful. Symptoms A horse developing ER will usually begin showing signs right after the beginning of exercise, although for mild cases, signs may not be seen until after the horse is cooled out. Signs include reluctance to move, stiffness or shortened gait when the animal is forced to move, and muscle spasms or cramps, with hard, painful muscles (especially the hindquarters) when palpated. If an observer is unfamiliar with ER, initial symptoms may appear to be tiredness or perhaps lameness but the condition is far more complex. Signs of a severe bout of ER may include: reluctance to move, sweating, elevated heart and respiratory rates as a result of the pain, anxious expression, shifting of weight from side to side, standing hunched and tense, passing reddish-brown urine, dehydration, shock, and inability to rise. Usually there is a correlation between how long it takes the signs to be seen and how severe the bout of ER is, with the more severe bouts of ER displaying signs right after work has begun. If signs of ER are seen, the horse should not be moved. Movement can cause further muscle damage. If the animal is far from the barn, it is best to trailer him back rather than move him. After a bout of ER, blood levels of CPK and AST rise. TreatmentMild or moderate cases= The horse should receive several days of NSAIDs, rest, and grain or pellets should be withheld. To improve blood flow to the muscles and help to with muscle spasms, heat therapy and Equine Massage may be beneficial, as well as hand-walking if the horse is comfortable walking. Turn-out in a pasture or paddock will encourage movement. A horse should be moving normally within 12‚Äì36 hours after the attack. =Severe cases= A horse may need fluids, especially if its urine is colored, the horse is receiving NSAIDs, or if he is dehydrated. Fluids will increase the production of urine that will in turn help flush out the excess, and potentially damaging, myoglobin from the kidneys and will reduce NSAID- produced kidney damage. Fluids should be administered until the urine is clear, which usually takes from a few hours to a few days. Vasodilators, such as acepromazine, can help improve blood flow to the muscles. However, the owner should only give acepromazine if it is prescribed by the horse's veterinarian, as it can lower the animal's blood pressure and can cause collapse in a severely dehydrated horse. The human drug dantrolene is sometimes given to alleviate the muscle spasms and prevent further degeneration of muscle tissue. Vitamin E is an anti-oxidant, and so may help prevent further cell degeneration in the affected muscles. However, vitamin E products must be used with caution if they also contain selenium. Bicarbonate will not help offset any lactic acid in the bloodstream, as lactic acid generally only accumulates in the affected muscles. Except to get a horse to his stall, a horse showing signs of severe ER should not be moved until he is comfortable enough to do so eagerly. This may take several days. After this point, it is important to either hand-walk the horse a few times each day, or provide him with a few hours of turnout in a pasture or paddock. =Returning the animal to work= A horse may be returned to work after it is no longer showing signs of ER, and is no longer on NSAIDs--which can hide signs of another bout of ER. If NSAIDs are needed to keep the horse comfortable, or if the horse is reluctant to continue work, the animal is not yet ready for a return to his regular training program. Blood tests should reveal that the horse's CPK concentration and AST levels are normal before the horse is returned to work. To begin bringing the horse back, he should be exercised at the walk and trot for 10‚Äì15 minutes at least once every day. This regimen will gradually be increased as the horse becomes more willing. For a moderate or severe bout of ER, it may take 4‚Äì6 weeks to return to the regular program. It is important not to push the horse more than he is ready or a relapse may occur. A second bout of ER is usually more severe than the first, not only taking the horse out of training for a longer time, but possibly causing permanent muscle damage. Grain is gradually reintroduced as exercise resumes, but grain can contribute to the development of ER. Prognosis For mild to moderate cases of ER, the prognosis is excellent, with the horse successfully returning to its former level of competition. However, if the vet's recommendations for preventing ER are not followed, ER may likely recur. Horses who experience a severe case of ER (the muscle degeneration is significant) are less likely to return to their previous level of competition, as fibrosis may have occurred, which would result in loss of muscle function. The prognosis is guarded for these horses. PreventionDiet= Reducing any extra energy in a horse's diet is essential to maintaining a horse that has experienced ER. Decreasing carbohydrates and increasing the daily intake of hay or pasture can usually accomplish this. Grain may need to be cut out altogether and replaced by a substitute, such as vegetable oil, to meet the individual energy needs of the horse. Grain should be reduced or removed from a horse's ration on days when he cannot be worked. =Exercise= Proper conditioning is very important in preventing ER. Beginning with a base of long, slow distance work will ensure that the horse has a foundation before proceeding on to more strenuous work. The horse should always have a 10-minute warm-up at the walk and trot before more strenuous work is begun, and should always have a proper cool down of 10 minutes. It is best that a horse receive exercise every day, or possibly twice a day, to prevent the recurrence of ER. If possible, avoid breaks in the horse's exercise schedule. Training, riding, driving, longeing, or turnout are all suitable. Daily pasture turnout is ideal for horses likely to suffer from ER, as it provides exercise and adds roughage to the animal's diet. =Supplements and drugs= As with any supplements and drugs, it is best to confer with a veterinarian as to the recommended dosages. Some drugs are not allowed in competition and may need to be withheld a few days before. Adding potassium and salt to the diet may be beneficial to horses that suffer from recurrent bouts of ER. Horses in hard training may need a vitamin E supplement, as their requirements are higher than horses in more moderate work. The horse may also be deficient in selenium, and need a feed in supplement. Selenium can be dangerous if overfed, so it is best to have a blood test to confirm that the horse is in need of supplemental selenium. Thyroid hormone supplementation is often beneficial for horses with low thyroid activity (only do so if the horse has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism). Other drugs that have been used with success include phenytoin, dantrolene, and dimethylglycine. Bicarbonate and NSAIDs are of no use in preventing ER.

He began composition of the work in 1839 in Vienna. He wrote the first four movements in Vienna, and the last on his return to Leipzig. Eric Sams has noted that the word \\"Faschingsschwank\\" contains the letters ASCH SCHA in that order of appearance, and that Schumann used these notes in sequence as melodic material for this work. Robert Morgan has noted Schumann's use of Ludwig van Beethoven's Op. 26 as a model in this work, and also Schumann's use of musical symmetry. David Neumeyer has noted the similarity of the first section to the Valse Noble, Op. 77, No. 7 (D. 969) of Franz Schubert.  Form  The work is in five movements: * Allegro: Very lively ('), B‚ô≠ major Marked (') (very lively), this is the longest and one of the more virtuosic movements, notable for its innovative rhythms and its brief quote of \\"La Marseillaise.\\" Of all the pieces of Faschingsschwank, this one is the least single-minded in its structure, introducing entirely new themes occasionally, only to be brought back repeatedly to two repeated motifs from the beginning. The piece comes to a crashing close with almost dissonant septuplet arpeggios. * Romanze: Pretty slow ('), G minor Probably the least virtuosic of the works, taking only a page of music. Despite its shortness and apparent ease, this is undoubtedly the saddest piece in the set. Despite the fact that most of the work is in G minor, the final measure brings a resolution into G major. * Scherzino, B‚ô≠ major Much as the title suggests, this work is a playful respite between two somber movements. A syncopated rhythm, with a melody based almost entirely on notes of the major chord, keeps the movement light and bouncing throughout, with the possible exception of the last run, a progression of octaves into a quick and bright cadence. * Intermezzo: With the greatest energy ('), E‚ô≠ minor The Intermezzo is marked by its flowing sound, created by keeping a steady stream of right-hand notes in the background, interspersed with melody notes. The piece, almost entirely based on transpositions, appears difficult at first due to its speed (some musicologists have remarked that Schumann's metronome was calibrated such that it went faster than it should have, due to extreme tempi such as this one). While the background notes in the right hand do indeed move extremely fast, the melody is more singing. The background notes are mostly suited to the shape and position of the hand, despite a few leaps of the melody; in the end, the left hand takes a modified, E-flat major version of the E-flat minor melody, under the right hand. The work is a melancholy and emotionally charged display of a pianist's capability to convey feeling. * Finale: Highly vivid ('), B‚ô≠ major The \\"extremely lively\\" Finale begins with triumphant announcements in B-flat octaves, interspersed with brilliant moving thirds. This section is the second longest, lasting about half the length of the first movement. The patterns seen in the Finale are somewhat reminiscent of Beethoven's compositional style, using a melody that moves in both hands, while both hands also play unchanging notes beneath the melody. The energetic runs of the final bars bring the set to a dramatic close.  Reception and performance  The Faschingsschwank aus Wien has been recorded many times, including outstanding live performances by Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli in 1957 and Sviatoslav Richter in 1962.

In April 2006, a version for Mac OS X was released. In December 2006 an expansion, Jets'n'Guns Gold, was released. A version for Linux has been developed by Linux Game Publishing. A sequel, Jets'n'Guns 2, was available in early access, and released on July 25, 2020. Gameplay Between levels, players are given the option to buy upgrades for their ship. Some of the most vital upgrades are for maneuverability, speed, health/armor and cooling. They can also give their ship a new paint job for free. Another item is the Atarix, which gives players a chance to unlock crates found when they destroy transport ships during a mission. There are several upgrades that boost the ship's defense and provide slow armor regeneration, such as shields and nanomachines. Other upgrades give players bounties for killing certain enemies, and bonuses for mass killings of enemy troops. There are also upgrades that allow players to customize up to five different weapon profiles, which can be switched mid-game, or allow players to change the angle of their weapons to adapt to changing strategic situations. As the game progresses, more weapons and items are made available. The fighter the player starts with only has slots for two front weapons and rather limited ship upgrades. The TMIG-226 has slots for one bombing system, one missile system, three front weapons, and one rear weapon. Some weapons can only be used in the front or rear slots. There is a large variety of weapons, ranging from flamethrowers to electro-balls to acid guns. Most weapons can be upgraded after they are bought. This may enhance power, projectile velocity, rate of fire, or the nature of the attack itself. When viewing the status of an individual weapon, meters are shown that indicate its power, heat generation and speed ratings. Most weapons give off heat when fired, indicated by a heating gauge. This heat dissipates when firing ceases. If the needle passes the orange and then red zones of the gauge the ship overheats, and it will be unable to fire until the needle passes back behind the orange zone. This makes upgrading the cooling system essential. With an improved cooling system, the ship will take longer to overheat, and will cool down faster. Missiles and bombs do not generate heat. The rate of fire for missiles is determined by their upgrade level. Bombs are the only weapons that have a limit pertaining to how many can be fired at any given time. Each bomb that is dropped uses up a portion of a slowly replenishing 'bomb meter'; the amount used by each bomb decreases with upgrades. Plot In Jets'n'Guns, the player starts out as a freelancer, contracted to drive out a gang of criminals from a sector of space. Soon, the player is contacted by their old commanding officer from a previous war, Col. Troubleman, who is based aboard the United Space Ship Impotence. He explains that Xoxx, the evil dictator, has appeared again and has kidnapped a scientist, Professor Von Hamburger. The professor was developing a gigantic quantum cannon, which he intended to use for peaceful purposes. Xoxx, however, wants the cannon because it could, theoretically, destroy the entire universe with a single shot. Erecta Von Hamburger, the professor's daughter, also contacts the player, but she is mainly concerned with the rescue of her father. The player first has to steal a better fighter, the TMIG-226, from the heavily guarded FeX labs. The player then has to rendezvous with the USS Impotence, and is only just saved from destruction by pirates by a well-timed volley of torpedoes from the Impotence. The majority of the following missions involve assaults on Xoxx's forces and attempts to ascertain the locations of the professor and the quantum cannon. Eventually, after many battles against Xoxx's forces and hench-beings, the player rescues the professor. Soon after, the location of the completed cannon, the Lord Chaos Mk 1, is discovered. However, when the player defeats Xoxx, Xoxx escapes in a \\"backup time washing machine\\", his parting message revealing that it is too late to stop the cannon firing. The universe is destroyed, leaving the player's ship flying in a field of rocky debris as the credits roll. Eventually, * (If the player did not cheat) The Player reaches a restaurant, where he gets a time machine upgrade for his plane. The player will chase Xoxx through the time warp, and after the player defeats it, he reaches the beginning of the game on a harder mode. * (If the player cheated) a time warp that featured earlier in the story re-appears, bringing the player back to the beginning of the game, except set on a harder mode. Development The developers have stated they were heavily inspired by the games Tyrian 2000, Project-X and Walker. As in Tyrian, players earn money by destroying enemies and picking up bonuses in each level. In-between levels, players can purchase weapons and devices for their ship, and upgrade them, provided they have enough money. However, Jets'n'Guns is more complex than Tyrian in this respect. There are many more weapons to choose from, a greater variety of devices to purchase and more ways to upgrade the player's ship. Also, unlike in Tyrian, where a player could get through most, if not all of the game using the weapons available at the start of the game (with upgrades and new ship systems), in JnG the player is forced to experiment with their weapons in order to be successful. The game has no lives, so the player can keep attempting a level until they beat it. According to the developers, one of the reasons they chose to do a side scroller, as opposed to a vertical scroller, was so they could insert much visual humour. Players can expect to see, among other things, spacefighters with knives strapped to them and various humorous signs. They can also expect most of the weapons in the weapon shop have advertising posters, emblazoned with messages such as \\"Ultimate destructive power!\\" or \\"As seen on TV!\\". Also, cultural references are scattered throughout the game, both in the equipment and the actual levels. In November 2012 Rake in Grass applied to Steam Greenlight system to add Jets'n'Guns Gold to Steam. A year later the game was accepted, with a scheduled release on 5 February 2014. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack was composed and performed by Machinae Supremacy. The band created over 50 minutes of original music for the game in a variety of styles. The band provides downloads on their site containing the game soundtrack ‚Äì however the song \\"Hero\\" is available separately ‚Äî in MP3 and Ogg format.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 10, 1996. After Homer realizes he has a bizarre medical condition that renders him unable to be knocked out, Moe Szyslak convinces him to start a career as a boxer and allow the bartender to manage him. The episode was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Mark Kirkland. It guest stars Michael Buffer as himself and Paul Winfield as Lucius Sweet. Plot During the Simpsons' visit to a high-tech gadget store, Bart buys a gimmicky utility belt. When he shows it off at school the next day, Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney beat him up and take it. To get the belt back, Homer confronts their fathers at Moe's Tavern; they beat him up but find that they cannot knock him down, even after breaking a pool cue over his head. After seeing Homer's ability to absorb physical punishment, Moe suggests that he take up boxing and allow Moe -- himself a former boxer -- to manage and train him. Marge insists that Homer have a full medical checkup first. Dr. Hibbert discovers that the layer of fluid around Homer's brain is thicker than normal, allowing him to withstand powerful blows to the head. Discovering that Homer is too weak and out of shape to inflict any damage by punching, Moe suggests that he let his opponents exhaust themselves trying to knock him out, then push them down to the canvas for an easy win. Homer prevails in his first fights against several homeless men, eventually rising to the top of the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association and attracting the attention of Lucius Sweet, Moe's former boxing manager. Lucius tells Moe that current heavyweight champion Drederick Tatum is about to be released from prison and wants a comeback fight, preferably against Homer. Moe knows that Tatum is far too strong and fit for Homer to tire out, but the lure of fame and fortune makes him agree to the fight. He promises Lucius that Homer will last at least three rounds. Moe quickly wins Homer over by feigning confidence in his fighting skills. Homer ignores Marge's pleas to withdraw from the fight, which is wildly hyped by the media. On the night of the event, Moe falsely promises Marge that he will throw in the towel if Homer appears to be in any danger. Tatum's first punch is strong enough to leave Homer badly dazed, and Marge urges him to start fighting back. Homer's punch completely misses Tatum, who hammers his head and prepares to deliver a punch that will either knock him out or kill him. Just before he can land the blow, Moe swoops in using a paramotor stolen from the Fan Man and airlifts Homer out of the ring while the audience boos loudly. Outside the arena, Marge thanks Moe for saving Homer. Tatum expresses his respect for Marge and Homer's love. Lucius berates Moe for failing to deliver even one round of boxing, but pays him $100,000 anyway. Moe flies off with the paramotor to help people around the world, much to Fan Man's chagrin.Episode Capsule at The Simpsons Archive. Production Don King. The episode was written by Jonathan Collier, who is a huge boxing fan. Knowing that the people on the internet would \\"give them grief\\", the writers went to a lot of effort to explain how Homer would be able to challenge for the Heavyweight Title. A lot of the scenes involving Homer fighting hobos were pitched by John Swartzwelder. Lucius Sweet is a parody of boxing promoter Don King, and is voiced by Paul Winfield, who had previously played King in HBO's 1995 biopic Tyson. In the script, Sweet was described as \\"A Don King type who looks and sounds exactly like Don King\\". The similarity is even pointed out by Homer with the line, \\"He is exactly as rich and as famous as Don King ‚Äì and he looks just like him, too!\\" King was asked to guest star, but turned the part down. Drederick Tatum is a parody of Mike Tyson. The name came from George Meyer, who went to high school with a boy named Drederick Timmins, which Meyer thought was a cool name. Tatum having done time in prison is a reference to the fact that, at the time of the episode's production, Tyson had just recently been released from prison after serving three years for rape. Homer is at one point referred to as \\"The Southern Dandy\\" as a reference to the old-time boxers and wrestlers who had similar nicknames. In preparation for this episode, Mark Kirkland watched several boxing films and is satisfied with how it turned out. Whenever designing rooms, Kirkland tries to show a bare lightbulb because he feels that it makes things more depressing. In the scene in Moe's office, there is a brief shot of a poster advertising \\"Szyslak Vs. Oakley\\" and \\"Kirkland Vs. Silverman\\", referring to then-executive producer Bill Oakley and The Simpsons directors Mark Kirkland and David Silverman. The scene where Tatum is walking to the ring surrounded by shady characters is based on a real life photo of Tyson. The fathers of Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney make their first and only appearances in the history of the show. Cultural references The episode opens with a parody of Bonanza. The montage of Homer fighting various hobos was based on a similar montage in Raging Bull. The music is inspired by \\"The Flower Duet\\" from the opera \\"Lakm√©\\" by L√©o Delibes. During the montage, there is a brief parody of the George Bellows painting \\"Dempsey and Firpo\\". The \\"Fan Man\\" is based on James Miller, a man famous for parachuting into arenas during big events. Homer's walk-out music is \\"Why Can't We Be Friends?\\" by War and Tatum's is \\"Time 4 Sum Aksion\\" by Redman, which was also used by Tyson for his first fight after his release from prison. The song heard over the end credits is a rendition of Barbra Streisand's \\"People\\", sung by Sally Stevens. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Homer They Fall\\" finished 29th in ratings for the week of November 4‚Äì10, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 10.0, equivalent to approximately 9.7 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files. In response to the season fourteen episode \\"Barting Over\\", which is about skateboarding, Raju Mudhar of the Toronto Star listed what he thought were \\"excellent\\" episodes of The Simpsons and scenes also related to sports. He included \\"The Homer They Fall\\", writing that Drederick Tatum is \\"a thinly veiled Mike Tyson parody who's made cameos over the years\\".Raju Mudhar, \\"Simpsons' sports spoofs simply 'excellent'; Stars like Tyson often lampooned Show celebrating 300th episode\\", Toronto Star, February 16, 2003, p. E.03. Similarly, in 2004 ESPN.com released a list of the Top 100 Simpsons sport moments, ranking the entire episode at #2, saying, \\"Greatest sports introduction ever: In the Tatum fight, Homer is introduced as the Brick Hithouse (and is also known as the Southern Dandy), and his walk-to-the-ring music is 'Why Can't We Be Friends?'\\". Drederick Tatum was placed at the eighteenth spot on the list. Conversely, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"the dullest, one-joke episode of the entire series\\".

This write protection affords the assurance that the data cannot be tampered with once it is written to the device. On ordinary (non-WORM) data storage devices, the number of times data can be modified is limited only by the lifespan of the device, as modification involves physical changes that may cause wear to the device. The \\"read many\\" aspect is unremarkable, as modern storage devices permit unlimited reading of data once written.Historical exceptions include time-limited discs such as Flexplay, designed for short-term rental of movies; and early non-volatile memory technologies such as magnetic-core memory and bubble memory, from which reading data also erased it. History WORM drives preceded the invention of the CD-R and DVD-R. An example was the IBM 3363.IBM 3363 Optical WORM drive These drives typically used a disk in a cartridge, with an ablative optical layer that could be written to only once, and were often used in places like libraries that needed to store large amounts of data. Interfaces to connect these to PCs also existed. Punched cards and paper tape are obsolete WORM media. Although any unpunched area of the medium could be punched after the first write of the medium, doing so was virtually never useful. Read-only memory (ROM) is also a WORM medium. Such memory may contain the instructions to a computer to read the operating system from another storage device such as a hard disk. The non-technical end-user, however, cannot write the ROM even once, but considers it part of the unchangeable computing platform. WORM was utilized for Broker-dealer records within the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Current WORM drives The CD-R and DVD-R optical disks for computers were common WORM devices. On these disks, no region of the disk can be recorded a second time. However, these disks often use a file system based on ISO 9660 that permits additional files, and even revised versions of a file by the same name, to be recorded in a different region of the disk. To the user of the disk, the disk appears to allow additions and revisions until all the disk space is used. The SD card and microSD card spec allows for multiple forms of write-protection. The most common form, only available when using a full-size SD card, provides a \\"mechanical write protect switch\\" which allows the user to advise the host computer that the user wants the device to be treated as read-only. This does not protect the data on the card if the host is compromised. Another option is to set the WORM function into the firmware of the memory card so it will always run on WORM card mode by default. By using this option, it will not require to trigger an external software trigger to enable WORM card function. Multiple vendors beginning in the early 2000s developed Magnetic WORM devices. These archival grade storage devices utilize a variation of RAID and magnetic storage technologies to secure data from unauthorized alteration or modification at both the hardware and software levels. As the cost of magnetic (and solid state) storage has decreased, so has the cost for these archival storage technologies. These technologies are almost always integrated directly to a content/document management system that manages retention schedules and access controls, along with document level history.http://www.aiim.org/documents/standards/ARP1-2009.pdf There are multiple vendors providing Magnetic Storage technologies including NetApp, EMC Centera,http://www.emc.com/collateral/hardware/data-sheet/c931-emc-centera- cas-ds.pdf KOM Networks,https://www.komnetworks.com/products.html and others.

It was established in 1925 to bring the best of both Greek and American educational systems to Greece and is considered one of the top schools in the country. The school's founders and big donors were Emmanuel Benakis, namesake of the Benaki Museum of Athens, as well as the school's main building, and Stephanos Deltas. Instruction is in both Greek and English. The school boasts a long list of successful alumni in politics, business, and the arts. Admission at either the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th grade is very selective. The school is often referred to as a power hub, due to its numerous influential alumni who remain closely connected after graduation.  Overview  The 3,000 students are divided among Athens and Psychico College, each of which includes a Kindergarten, an Elementary School, a middle school, and an upper school. The upper school of Psychico College also offers students interested in studies abroad the International Baccalaureate programme. In addition the adult education program enrolls 2,000 students. Approximately 98% of its graduates go on to university, half of them abroad. Athens College is known for hosting an annual school fair (Panigiri), which raises money for charity and attracts people from all around Athens and other schools. Athens College has a long tradition in oratory/rhetoric competitions. Starting with the Three Hierarch speech competition in 10th grade and 25 March speech competition in 11th grade, the school's oratory competitions apex with the two Senior Speech competitions, Delta and Howland. The Howland prize is given to the one student who excels in public speaking in the Greek Language and the Delta Prize is given to the student whose English speech is selected first among his peers for both its content and its delivery. Both competitions include the approximately 400 students of each graduating class and have semi-finals and finals with different judging committees usually composed of people from the realm of education, diplomacy, and politics. The winners of the two competitions deliver their speeches at Commencement in July, in front of thousands of attendees. Athens College has a great tradition in mathematics competitions. The school's students are prepared in the school's Mathematics Club. Many of the school's representatives over the past few years have succeeded in national and international competitions. Also notable are the school's distinctions in competitions such as AMC 8, AMC 10 and AIME. The school's Drama Club has begun a tradition the last years by earning numerous prizes, distinctions and awards in national and regional tournaments. Athens College's library is one of the largest school libraries in Europe and was the first in Greece to have all its books electronically cataloged. The sporting facilities of Athens College include a gym, two football pitches (one gravel), seven outdoor basketball courts, four outdoor tennis courts, an indoor swimming pool, a track & field court, and an indoor sports center with facilities for squash, table tennis, gymnastics, volleyball, martial arts, and other events. Athens College is incorporated in both Greece and the State of New York and is a not-for-profit, tax-exempt organization. Furthermore, very important for the school's spirit and an indication of its special status is its scholarship program (funded by the parents associations and the alumni club SAKA) which has given numerous students from all socioeconomic layers the opportunity to study there.  History  Athens College was established in 1925 by a group of enlightened Greeks (Emmanuel Benakis and Stephanos Delta among them) with the support of American philhellenes, including Dr. Bert Hodge, Director of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Athens College Official website The Founders‚Äô vision, which in fact was translated into reality even in the earliest years of the school‚Äôs existence, revolved around the creation of a school which fostered the \\"harmonious development of students‚Äô intellectual, ethical and physical capabilities, especially character\\" by enhancing the existing educational system with \\"modern educational methods which took into account the Greek nation‚Äôs history, traditions, culture and specific needs.\\" Athens College, 1925‚Äì1980 The Founding Committee of Athens College, which became its board of directors, was organized in May 1924. Its members were Epaminondas Charilaos, President of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Bert Hodge Hill, Director of the American School of Classical Studies, Stephanos Delta, retired businessman and treasurer of the Refugee Settlement Commission, Stavros Papadakis, YMCA. secretary, Emmanuel Benakis, retired businessman, former Minister and former Mayor of Athens, Petros Calligas, former Minister, Harold Jacquith, Director of the Near East Relief, Nicolas Kyriakides, shipowner. Later, Emmanuel Benakis who has been a major donator for the College, was named emeritus member and was replaced at the Committee by his son Antonios. The institution has been officially recognized with the title \\"Hellenic-American Educational Foundation\\". The courses began in October 1925 with 15 pupils (it was a school for boys). A building was rented at Androu Street for $215 per month, and Emmanuel Benakis and Stephanos Delta covered the first expenses (¬£2000). The first Headmaster of the College was the Englishman F. Stroud Read. The American Homer Davis, former teacher at Robert College of Constantinople, had in charge the English Department. Stephanos Delta provided for some years the needed funds for the operation of the School. In 1926 the Greek-American Evripides Kehayas, president of Standard Commercial Tobacco Co., offered $100,000 to the College. In January 1927, a \\"Board of Trustees of Athens College in Greece\\" was founded at New York. The same year, Emmanuel Benakis offered to the College another $100,000 to buy land at Psychico, suburbs of Athens. Later, Benakis and Delta offered a huge supplement of $500,000. Other Greek personalities, as Eleftherios Venizelos, provided more funds. A new building began to be constructed in March 1927. Athens College begun its operation at the new building, called Benaki Hall, in autumn 1928, with 270 pupils, 91 being boarders. President of the College from 1927 was Dr. Henry Dewing. The official opening of Benaki Hall and of the Kehayas aisle took place in May 1929. In June of the same year, graduated the first five pupils. During the academic year 1930‚Äì31, the number of the pupils reached 351, and the number of professors 44 (9 were Americans, the rest of them Greek). A seventh year was then added to the six-year Gymnasium. This supplementary year will be a particularity of Athens College. During the 1930s, the College had many economic difficulties, and new collects were then organized. With money from various sponsors, new buildings have been constructed, the library has been founded as well a scholarship fund. Homer Davis, who was Acting Director of the College after the departure of Dewing in 1930, was named its President in 1932. He will keep this charge until 1960, and will be Acting President in 1964‚Äì65. The Greek co-directors during those years, were Michael Michaelides- Nouaros (1925‚Äì27), Demetrius Georgakis (1927‚Äì36), Emmanuel Troulinos (1936‚Äì62), Constantine Lalopoulos (1962‚Äì73) and Sofocles Markianos (1973‚Äì78). The first school-laboratories have been organized in Athens College during the 1930s, by professor of physics Panos Mavromatis. Four rooms have been provided for laboratories of physics, of chemistry, of biology and of geology. The experimental teaching has been from then a main educational policy of the College. From Athens College graduated many eminent Greek scientists, artists and politicians. This College has been an institution preparing Greek students to enter English and U.S. universities. In 1974, after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, Athens College accepted 30 Greek Cypriot refugees into the College Boarding Department and gave them full scholarships.Athens College Bulletin. \\"Cypriot Refugee Scholarship Program\\" pg. 19 Athens College, 1980‚Äìtoday Athens College (and its sister school, Psychico College, founded in 1980) is owned by the Hellenic-American Educational Foundation, a non-profit organization with facilities located in Psychico (Middle and High Schools and the International Baccalaureate Diploma Program) and Kantza in eastern Attica (two elementary schools: Bodossakio and Latsio). When it first began, in October 1925, Athens College occupied a rented building on 18 Androu Street in the heart of Athens. The school moved to Psychico in 1929. That same year, the Benaki Hall was dedicated by Eleftherios Venizelos, then Greece‚Äôs Prime Minister and an ardent supporter of the school. In his speech during the dedication ceremony, Venizelos made some memorable remarks: \\"... Private schools are where the greatest and most successful innovations may flourish: loosely supervised by the State and complying with broad State guidelines, private schools enjoy the freedom which public schools lack and, therefore, may achieve great progress.

He sat as a Member of Parliament for Ayrshire off and on from 1780 to 1796. That year he became Lord Lieutenant of Ayrshire, a post he held until his death. In 1798, having previously succeeded to the earldom through his third cousin, he was elected a representative peer and moved to the House of Lords. On 15 February 1806, he was created Baron Ardrossan in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, enabling him to sit the Lords in his own right. He was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1814. As large ships were unable to reach Glasgow due to the silting of the River Clyde, Montgomerie promoted and partially funded the Glasgow, Paisley and Ardrossan Canal. However, funds ran out, and the canal was only constructed from Glasgow to Johnstone via Paisley. The Glasgow terminus of the canal was at Port Eglinton. Though the wharf is now filled in, the neighbouring Eglinton Street still bears his name. Preparatory work on the canal from the new harbour created at Ardrossan was used as the basis for Glasgow Street, which is the main thoroughfare of the town. Montgomerie was an amateur composer and cellist. His best-known work is the dance tune \\"Ayrshire Lasses,\\" and other composers dedicated works to him, including Thomas Arne.David Johnson. \\"12th Earl of Eglinton\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L.

Filmed in Baldwin County, Alabama, a pack of massive, bloodthirsty, genetically engineered fish combing the quiet waters of the river in the Louisiana Bayou, searching for prey. Based on the snakehead fish incident in a Crofton, Maryland, pond, Frankenfish is one of three movies based on the incident, the others being Snakehead Terror and Swarm of the Snakehead. Plot Medical examiner Sam Rivers and biologist Mary Callahan travel into the bayou to investigate the mysterious death of a fisherman, John Crankton. Having grown up in the area, Sam is comfortable in his surroundings while Mary is not. They find Elmer noodling for catfish in the swamp canals. With Elmer, Sam and Mary travel upriver to the fishing community. They meet Gloria Crankton, the wife of John Crankton. Gloria's daughter Eliza and her semi-boyfriend Dan also live in the house. Gloria explains that a strange boat washed upriver three months ago after a hurricane and strange things have happened since. Sam and Mary find a large fishing boat along the bank of a canal. They explore the interior while Elmer waits in the boat outside. They discover the remains of the crew in the hold. Upset, Mary clumsily knocks Elmer from the boat and something drags him down. Sam and Mary flee in the boat, unaware that they have triggered a homing signal on the ship. On the mainland, a team relays the information to their employer, Jeff, a wealthy bounty hunter. Later on that night Roland hears noises while on the roof of his houseboat. He leans over the edge and a frankenfish leaps up and decapitates him. His wife Bobbi attempts to escape the houseboat on a small boat but the fish flips her out and kills her. Frightened, the group tries to flee in boats but the fish destroys them. Trying to come with a plan to escape Sam tries to get over to Roland and Bobbi's house to try and start it up to escape but it turns out that the houseboat is inoperable. On a neighboring stilt house, Ricardo baits a large hook using an entire catfish and manages to land one of the frankenfish. Nearly as big as a full-grown man, the fish can breathe air and hops forward biting at Ricardo's legs. Ricardo manages to kill it with a shotgun blast to the head. In vengeance, he tears out its heart and barbecues it. As he takes his first bite a second frankenfish leaps from the water and devours him. While everyone panics, Mary declares she has an idea on how to get off the boathouse. Before she can explain, she is killed in an explosion. A fire propels a propane tank into the boathouse causing an explosion that sends Eliza into the water. Sam dives in and rescues her. Simultaneously, a frankenfish leaps from the water and bites off Gloria's legs. The fish have begun attacking the boathouses, punching holes in them to make them sink. Jeff and his crew arrive and the fish attack them too. Knocked out of the boat, they swim quickly to the safety of the sinking stilt houses. Jeff explains that the fish are genetically engineered snakeheads. Sam, Eliza, and Dan have no choice but to join Jeff in pursuing the fish. The crew follows a trail of blood back to the fish's den. Jeff forces Sam at gunpoint to enter first. Sam flees the den as behind him a larger frankenfish kills two hunters. Dan, Sam, and Eliza quickly leave on the fan boat, chased by the frankenfish. Dan falls from the boat during the chase but scrambles up a mudbank. Realizing they cannot outrace the monster, Sam drives the fan boat up a stand of tree stumps and knocks off the protective lining of the fan. Unable to slow its momentum, the frankenfish launches into the whirling blades to its death. Sam and Eliza kiss and go back the way they came to get Dan. However, Dan is trapped in the mud as dozens of baby frankenfish attack him. CastHome media Frankenfish was released on DVD and VHS on October 26, 2004.  Reception  James Mudge of Beyond Hollywood wrote that the film, as judged by its peers, was \\"a surprising success\\". Jon Condit of Dread Central rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"It is what it is and it‚Äôs better at being it than most of the recent offerings similar to it.\\" Dennis Prince of DVD Verdict wrote that the film is a retread but has good gore effects. In a 2018 retrospective review, Glenn Cochrane of ScreenRealm wrote that although the film's visual effects are severely dated, it still offers a fun time for viewers with \\"a penchant for cheesy B movie creature features.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Official site at Scifi.com Category:2004 films Category:2004 television films Category:2000s action films Category:2004 horror films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Giant monster films Category:Syfy original films Category:Films shot in Alabama Category:Horror television films Category:Films directed by Mark A.Z.

It is the third game in Babylonian Castle Saga series which started with the 1984 arcade game, The Tower of Druaga. Plot The story of The Quest of Ki is actually a prequel to the original Tower of Druaga. It occurs shortly after the demon Druaga has stolen the Blue Crystal Rod and taken it to his tower. The goddess Ishtar sends the priestess Ki to the tower in order to retrieve it. The game then follows her doomed quest to the top of the tower, and leads directly into the story of the original game. Gameplay The game is a side-scrolling platformer with one hundred levels. In each level, the player's goal is to pick up a key and open the door leading to the next area. Various enemies, including slimes, ghosts, and wizards, appear on each floor, and any contact with them results in death. Ki has no weapons, and thus can not damage or defeat any of the enemies. Her only abilities are to dash and jump. As long as the player holds the jump button down, Ki can rise indefinitely into the air. However, contact with the ceiling or dashing against a wall will cause her to drop to the ground and become stunned for several seconds. This mechanic of floating and getting stunned from bumping against the walls or ceiling is similar to the 1983 Atari vector arcade game, Major Havoc. Many of the levels consist of puzzles in which the player must carefully regulate the height and direction of Ki's jumps. Each stage in the game contains one or more treasure chests, which hold various items. Although many of the items bestow helpful abilities, the effects only last for the floor on which they were found. After completing the game, players can gain access to forty bonus stages. These stages contain cameos from the Pac-Man ghosts and the enemies from Dig Dug.

It is the largest business process outsourcing and professional services company in the UK, with an overall market share of 29% in 2016, and has clients in central government, local government and the private sector. It also has a property and infrastructure consultancy division which is the fourth largest multidisciplinary consultancy in the UK. Roughly half of its turnover comes from the private sector and half from the public sector. Whilst UK-focused, Capita also has operations across Europe, Africa and Asia. Capita is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History Capita was formed in 1984 as a division of the non-profit CIPFA (Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy). In 1987 it became an independent company with 33 staff as a result of a management buy-out, led by Rod Aldridge, and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1991. In March 2006, Executive Chairman Rod Aldridge resigned in the aftermath of claims that contracts awarded to the Group were influenced by his loan of ¬£1 million to the Labour Party. Aldridge resigned saying that he denied the claims, but to avoid any lingering doubts about it, he was leaving the company. Aldridge had overseen the company's growth from a small company in 1987 to a FTSE 100 member in 2006. He was replaced by his longtime associate Paul Pindar. In February 2007, a Capita office in Victoria, London was subject to a letter bomb attack. One person was injured. On 2 October 2009, one of Capita's businesses (Capita Financial Group) announced plans to move some of its operations from London to Leeds. On 1 July 2011, Capita acquired Ventura, a customer contact specialist for a cash consideration of ¬£65 million. On 28 February 2013, Capita bought the Fire Service College from the Department for Communities and Local Government for ¬£10 million. In 2014 Pindar stepped down as chief executive. He was replaced by Andy Parker. The company acquired Avocis, a German call centre business, in 2015, Orange Bus, a specialist digital interaction agency, in 2016 and NYS Corporate events and travel agency in 2017. In October 2017, the company announced that former Amec Foster Wheeler CEO Jonathan Lewis would take over as CEO from 1 December 2017 following departure of Andy Parker. After completing an initial assessment, on 31 January 2018 Lewis announced a profits warning, dividend suspension, a ¬£700m rights issue, cost cutting and a disposals programme, as net debts were predicted to hit ¬£1.15bn and a pensions deficit reached ¬£381m. The announcement knocked 47% off Capita's shares, reducing its market value by over ¬£1.1bn. The share price slide continued the following day, losing a further 13%. On 3 April 2018, Capita shares fell 6% to a 20-year low after British Airways decided to retain in-house operation of two UK call centres rather than award contracts to run them to Capita. On 23 April 2018, Capita launched a cash call to raise ¬£701m and reported a ¬£513m loss for the previous financial year. On 1 August 2018, Capita announced its profits in the six months to 30 June had dropped to ¬£80.5m (from ¬£195m in the same period in 2017), while revenues were down 4% to ¬£1.98bn; the company's shares fell almost 9% after markets opened, to 148p a share. Following Lewis's appointment, the company embarked on a \\"multi-year strategy\\" to turnaround the company. In May 2019 the company became the first FTSE 250 company in 30 years to appoint rank-and-file workers to its board. Lyndsay Browne, a chartered accountant and finance manager, and Joseph Murphy, a project manager in the real estate division, beat competition from other internal candidates to become the first worker's representatives on the Capita board. In September 2019 the company announced that it was re-branding as a \\"purpose-led\\" living wage employer, changing its logo for the first time in 13 years. The company said that from April 2020 it will pay all 40,000 of its employees an independently verified \\"real living wage.\\" This will involve a pay rise for almost 6,000 employees. The rates, which are set at the basic income needed to cover the real cost of living, are overseen by the Living Wage Commission. OperationsConsultancy division= In July 2019 the company announced that it was launching a consultancy arm. The new division will employ around 1,000 consultants and compete with the likes of Accenture, Deloitte and KPMG. =Healthcare recruitment= Capita entered the healthcare recruitment market during May 2011 through acquisition of Team24, a healthcare recruitment specialist owned by Robert Stiff - extending the services offered within the recruitment industry. =Capita Financial Administrators= In 2006 Capita Financial Administrators (CFA) was fined ¬£300,000 by the Financial Services Authority for having poor anti-fraud controls. The division provides administration services for third parties and the Capita Group. =Legal Services= Capita also intended to enter into the legal services market and entered into a funding arrangement with the Law Firm Optima Legal Services Limited which saw them, in the period between May 2006 to the end of 2009 invest a total of ¬£36,700,000 by way of investment loans into Optima. As part of the funding arrangement Capita Group had the option of acquiring the shares of Optima Legal Services for the nominal sum of ¬£1 upon the full implementation of the Legal Services Act 2007 which would make ownership of law firms by the likes of Capita possible. It is thought that such Alternative Business Structures (\\"ABS\\") could be lawful around October 2011. However, on 9 August 2010 it was reported that the Solicitors Regulatory Authority (\\"SRA\\") had found that the arrangement breached its rules in that it effectively amounted to an ABS. As a consequence, Optima Legal Services Lead Litigation and Property Partners, Philip Robinson and Anthony Ruane respectively were both severely reprimanded by the SRA for what was found to be professional misconduct and only narrowly avoided referral to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and Adrian Lamb, former CEO of Optima Legal Services Limited, left the business in June 2010. =Constructionline= In 1998, Capita won the contract to run Constructionline, the newly created Public-Private Partnership owned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). In January 2015, Capita acquired Constructionline outright from BIS for ¬£35m. Three years later, on 31 January 2018, Capita announced it wanted to sell Constructionline as part of a transformation programme including disposal of non-core assets and cost cutting. In June 2018, it was reported that Constructionline had been sold to private equity investor Warburg Pincus for ¬£160m. =NHS Services= In June 2014 it was reported that at least five of eight Liverpool NHS Trusts which had contracted their payroll and recruitment to Capita in 2012 were withdrawing because of concerns about the quality of the service provided. Several NHS trusts contracted with the company for human resources services. West London Mental Health NHS Trust cancelled their contract in September 2014 after the company proved \\"unable to meet acceptable 'time to hire' targets\\", particularly for nurses. At the same time Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust and Liverpool Heart and Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust terminated their contracts. In November Mersey Care Trust revealed that \\"information governance issues\\" had been uncovered when the services were taken back in- house. Details of staff at other Merseyside trusts were sent to Liverpool Community Health Trust‚Äôs HR department. The company was awarded a 4-year contract to become sole provider of administrative services including payment administration, management of medical records and eligibility lists of practitioners for GPs, opticians and dentists across the UK by NHS England in June 2015. In July 2016 it was reported that there was \\"a large backlog of unprocessed correspondence relating to patients\\". It was earlier reported that the company was unable to deal \\"effectively\\" with the movement of paper records between practices. In 2015, an undercover Daily Telegraph investigation showed that in some cases locum agencies, Medicare and Team24 owned by Capita were charging some hospitals higher fees than others and giving false company details. The agencies were charging up to 49% of the fee. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised agencies who sought \\"big profits\\" at the expense of the NHS and taxpayers and promised to \\"reduce the margins rip- off agencies are able to generate.\\" The company established Primary Care Support England in September 2015, replacing former regional services provided by each local health authority. The new service was described as shambolic by the Local Optical Committee Support Unit and the Optical Confederation. A deal was negotiated to enable optician practices to claim interest, administrative costs and bank charges on late payments of General Ophthalmic Services fees by Capita. In August 2016 a survey of GPs found 85% were missing records of recently registered patients, 65% had experienced shortages of clinical supplies or delays in deliveries, and 32% had suffered from missed or delayed payments. Delays in the payment of GP trainees' salaries were also reported. The situation was repeated in October 2017 with The Guardian reporting that \\"hundreds\\" of trainee GPs had not been paid. Capita was unable to say how many were affected in what the Cameron fund - a GP hardship charity - blamed on \\"another botched privatisation.\\" Inadequacies by Capita may have put patients at risk. The National Audit Office maintains almost 90 women were told incorrectly they were no longer in the cervical screening programme. Patients could have been at risk due to trouble with the 'performers list' a list of NHS dentists, GP's and opticians. \\"The failure to update performers lists may have compromised patient safety in cases where practitioners should have been removed,\\" the report authors maintained. Roughly 1,000 dentists, doctors and opticians could not work in 2016 due to delays processing new applications. Further failures included a backlog of 500,000 patient registration letters, failure to deliver medical supplies, and patients' medical records being lost or delayed. In March 2019 Simon Stevens announced that the cervical screening programme administration they had been running would be brought back in house. =Education services= * SIMS.net ‚Äì Schools Information Management Software a Management information system used in 70% of primary and secondary schools across England and Wales to record many aspects of pupil data. In March 2009, Capita SIMS was said to be responsible for sending a truancy warning notice to the family of a Cheshire school pupil who had died two months before. SIMS also links with Capita One (through a process called B2B), which is a database used within Local Education Authorities for general analysis and overview of pupil and school data. * Individual Learning Account ‚Äì A¬£290million scheme intended to give financial support to adult learners that was opened in 2000 and scrapped in 2001 following widespread and massive fraud. * Connexions Card ‚Äì A¬£109million scheme that involved issuing 16- to 19-year-olds with smart cards that recorded their lesson attendance and rewarded them with discounts on consumer goods. It ran from 2002 until it was terminated in 2006 owing to lack of uptake. * Education Maintenance Allowance for the Learning and Skills Council * Capita Education Resourcing - Capita Education Resourcing is an education recruitment specialist with a large networks of schools, colleges and nurseries across England and Wales. They have 19 offices covering teaching jobs operating throughout the UK. =Irish postcodes= In 2014, Capita were awarded the contract to introduce postcodes to the Republic of Ireland. The Irish communications minister has welcomed the implementation saying that the Irish code is the first in the world to be unique to each individual address. The scheme was launched in July 2015. The emergency services have expressed concern that the new system may lead to responders having difficulty getting to incidents. Further, the Irish Data Protection Authority has raised concerns over the design of the code as information about individuals will be made more accessible. Liam Duggan, CEO of Capita Ireland stated at a Government enquiry in 2014 that they had thoroughly tested the new system for unsuitable words and even used a game of Scrabble for this purpose. The project is generally running to programme and budget: roll out, which was originally planned to start in March 2015, will now take place in \\"mid-2015\\" and the cost, which was originally budgeted at ‚Ç¨25 million has increased to ‚Ç¨27 million. Criticism Capita Group has not been received well by the public and in the media. It has gained the nickname \\"Crapita\\", particularly from the coverage in the satirical and current affairs magazine Private Eye, which routinely documents the company's many failures and setbacks in the public sector. It was revealed in January 2013 that Capita was embroiled in a scandal over misinforming people that they had to leave the UK as they had no valid visa. One such person was, in fact, the holder of a UK passport. In 2014, a leak to The Guardian revealed that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) had to send civil servants in to help the company process personal independence payments for the seriously ill and the disabled. \\"Waiting times for assessment,\\" the newspaper noted, \\"have been so long that in some cases people with terminal conditions have died before receiving a penny.\\" The 2015 sale of a government research operation charged with overlooking food safety to Capita has been criticized by Tim Lang, an advisor to the UK government and the WHO on food safety issues. Arguing that a for-profit operation will be under pressure to ignore low-paying projects vital to public safety and the environment, he indicates that there is no profit in public research concerning food and biodiversity or food and pesticide residues, and predicts \\"commercial concerns will skew Fera's priorities\\" Former Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron questioned how Atos and Capita could have been paid over ¬£500m from taxpayers money for assessing fitness to work as 61% who appealed won their appeals. Farron stated, \\"This adds to the suspicion that these companies are just driven by a profit motive, and the incentive is to get the assessments done, but not necessarily to get the assessments right. They are the ugly face of business.\\" Capita has also been criticised for several issues involving army recruitment.

The strip appeared in The Pendleton Times in Pendleton, Indiana (and would be the only newspaper to publish the strip) from 1972 to 1975, but failure to take the character to mainstream success led Davis to instead create the comic strip Garfield. Mike Peters, the cartoonist for Mother Goose and Grimm, has said that Gnorm Gnat is now a part of \\"cartoon folklore\\" as a failure that paved the way for major success.Peters, Mike. \\"Foreword\\". In 20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection. By Jim Davis. New York: Ballantine Books, 1998, p. 10. History Davis developed the idea for the strip while assisting cartoonist Tom Ryan on his Tumbleweeds strip. Davis saw the possibilities for gags with insect characters, and the strip was adopted by The Pendleton Times starting in early 1972. However, Davis also approached syndicates to publish Gnorm Gnat and was rejected.Davis, Jim. 20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection. New York: Ballantine Books, 1998, p. 14. According to writers Mark Acey and Scott Nickel, Davis would receive rejections for Gnorm Gnat for years.Acey, Mark and Scott Nickel, Garfield at 25: In Dog Years I'd Be Dead.

Davis also recounted that one editor had advised him that \\"Your art is good, your gags are great, but bugs-- nobody can relate to bugs!\\" Davis took the advice to heart and then turned to Garfield. Some in the media have also reported that Davis had become \\"bored with the strip.\\"Lenz, Ryan. \\"Drawing on cartoon cat's success.\\" Packet and Times. Orillia, Ontario: July 23, 2003, pg. B.3.

For years, it was believed that last-ever published strip of Gnorm Gnat was Gnorm Gnat meeting his demise by being stepped on by the foot of a human, Monty Python-style. This was later debunked after a Google Drive document containing many editions of The Pendleton Times that included Gnorm Gnat comics was uploaded in 2019, with the actual final strip (published on Christmas Day 1975) just having the protagonist thank the fans who stuck with the strips while standing next to the message Merry Christmas with Gnorm saying \\"Thanks, Pendleton.\\" The document also contained some strips for Davis' next work, Jon, a prototype to what would become Garfield, which debuted in the Times on January 8, 1976, two weeks after Gnorm Gnat ended (it was renamed Garfield on August 1, 1977). =Legacy= Garfield would later become accepted for national distribution by United Feature Syndicate in 1978 (the strip ended its run in the Times on March 2, and made its national debut on June 19 that year) and became a worldwide success. In 1992, one Garfield book called Garfield Takes His Licks referred to Gnorm as an in-joke. Gnorm Gnat was listed as #2 among the \\"Top Ten Comic Strips Jim Davis Tried Before Garfield\\", being placed behind \\"Garfield the Toaster\\" and above \\"Milt the Incontinent Hamster.\\"Davis, Jim. Garfield Takes His Licks. New York: Ballantine Books, 1992. In 1997, one Garfield comic strip featured a fly talking to a spider; Davis alluded to Gnorm Gnat by commenting that, \\"After nearly 30 years, I finally got a bug strip published\\".Davis, Jim. 20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection. New York: Ballantine Books, 1998, p. 155. However, Davis's fellow-cartoonist Mike Peters looked back on Gnorm Gnat in an unfavorable way. Peters claimed, \\"We can always be thankful that Jim's first strip never made it... Gnorm Gnat has gone down in cartoon folklore as a most fortunate failure. Can you imagine a bright orange gnat on every car window? A great, huge gnat for the Thanksgiving Day Parade. A big fat gnat saying 'I hate Tuesdays.'\\" Characters The characters of Gnorm Gnat were meant to be presented in a \\"simple, humorous style\\" of appearance. Davis displays the characters and describes them in the book 20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection. *Gnorm Gnat is a gnat who Davis says plays the \\"straight man\\" who sometimes behaves like the character Walter Mitty. *Lyman is an insect with buck teeth who wears a hat. He is supposed to be insane. Davis later named a character after him in Garfield. *Freddy is a fruit fly who has two weeks to live. *Dr. Rosenwurm is a worm who is highly intelligent. *Cecil Slug is a slug merely described as a stupid character. *Drac Webb is a villain who eats other characters. He often does other threatening things such as trapping characters into webs. *Wench Webb is another character from the Gnorm Gnat comic strip. She is one of only two female characters in the strip and is Drac Webb's wife. *Natasha is a slug and the other female character in the strip, being Gnorm's crush.

It is dated on the basis of epigraphy to the first half of the 1st century AD. Its provenance is unknown, but a French collector acquired the stone from Nazareth. It is now in the collections of the Louvre. The text is read by scholars in the context of Roman law pertaining to exhumation and reburial, mentioned also by Pliny.Pliny, Epistles 10.68f. The inscription is of interest to some authors for its indirect relationship to the historicity of Jesus, even though the text contains no reference to Jesus of Nazareth. A 2020 study of the marble's isotopes showed that the tablet came from a quarry in the Greek island of Kos, casting much doubt on the theory that it has any relationship to Jesus, and it may instead have been inscribed as a reaction to the desecration of the grave of the Kos tyrant Nikias circa 20 BCE. Description and provenance Roman province of Judea. The marble tablet measures 24 by 15 inches, with the koine Greek inscription appearing in fourteen lines. It was acquired in 1878 by Wilhelm Fr√∂hner (1834‚Äì1925), and sent from Nazareth to Paris. Fr√∂hner entered the item in his manuscript inventory with the note \\"Dalle de marbre envoy√© de Nazareth en 1878.\\" Though indicating that the marble was sent from Nazareth, the note does not state that it was discovered there. Nazareth was a significant antiquities market in the 1870s, as was Jerusalem, and may have been \\"nothing more than ‚Ä¶ a shipping center\\" for the item. noting the coincidental connection with the burial of Jesus made by Baldensperger, Cumont and Momigliano. Since 1925 it has been in the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris, displayed in the Cabinet des M√©dailles. The inscription, with a facsimile, was published in 1930 by Franz Cumont,Franz Cumont, \\"Un r√©scrit imp√©rial sur la violation de s√©pulture\\" in Revue Historique 163 1930:341-66. who had been alerted to it by Rostovtseff. Text The Greek used in the inscription is relatively poor. Clyde E. Billington provides the following English translation: > > It is my decision [concerning] graves and tombs‚Äîwhoever has made them for > the religious observances of parents, or children, or household members‚Äîthat > these remain undisturbed forever. But if anyone legally charges that another > person has destroyed, or has in any manner extracted those who have been > buried, or has moved with wicked intent those who have been buried to other > places, committing a crime against them, or has moved sepulcher-sealing > stones, against such a person, I order that a judicial tribunal be created, > just as [is done] concerning the gods in human religious observances, even > more so will it be obligatory to treat with honor those who have been > entombed. You are absolutely not to allow anyone to move [those who have > been entombed]. But if [someone does], I wish that [violator] to suffer > capital punishment under the title of tomb-breaker. Legal and cultural background Violatio sepulchri ('tomb violation') was a crime under Roman law, as noted by Cicero (d. 43 BC). The Nazareth Inscription prescribes the death penalty for the offense. citing Cicero, De Legibus 3 and Digest 47.12, with additional citations of modern scholarship. A tomb at which funeral rites had been duly performed became a locus religiosus, belonging to the divine rather than to the human realm.Gaius, Inst. II.3, 6, 9; Clust. 3.44.2 Roman Imperial tombstones are often inscribed with a curse (defixio) against anyone who desecrates the grave. Analysis Coin showing image of Nikias of Kos, Ruler of Kos from c. 50 BCE to c. 20 BCE. The Nazareth inscription is believed by researchers to be in response to disturbing his grave. Scholars have analysed the language and style of the Nazareth inscription and attempted to date it. It has been discussed in the context of tomb-robbery in antiquity. Francis de Zulueta dates the inscription, based on the style of lettering, to between 50 B.C. and A.D. 50, but most likely around the turn of the era. As the text uses the plural form \\"gods\\", Zulueta concluded it most likely came from the Hellenized district of the Decapolis. Like Zulueta, J. Spencer Kennard, Jr. noted that the reference to \\"Caesar\\" indicated that \\"the inscription must have been derived from somewhere in Samaria or Decapolis; Galilee was ruled by a client-prince until the reign of Claudius\\". It was once of interest to historians of the New Testament. Metzger gives a summary of discussion among New Testament scholars and ancient historians alike. Some authors, citing the inscription's supposed Galilean origin, interpreted it as Imperial Rome's clear reaction to the empty tomb of Jesus and specifically as an edict of Claudius, who reigned AD 41-54. \\"It is an imperial edict, belonging either to the reign of Tiberius (A.D. 14-37) or of Claudius (A.D. 41-54). And it is an invective, backed with heavy sanctions, against meddling around with tombs and graves! It looks very much as if the news of the empty tomb had got back to Rome in a garbled form. (Pontius Pilate would have had to report: and he would obviously have said that the tomb had been rifled). This edict, it seems, is the imperial reaction.\\" If the inscription was originally set up in Galilee, it can date no earlier than 44, the year Roman rule was imposed there. However, the 2020 isotope study of the marble published in the Journal of Archaeological Science clarified the origin of the tablet and points to another interpretation. The scientists took a sample from the back of the tablet, and used laser ablation to help determine the isotope ratio of the stone. The enrichment of carbon 13 and depletion of Oxygen 18 allowed a confident identification of the source of the marble as the upper quarry in the island of Kos. The team proposed that the edict was issued by Augustus after the desecration of the tomb of the Kos tyrant Nikias.

Lagoon-A-Beach currently has ten water slides that fall into three main categories: tube slides, body slides, and drop slides. Its name is a play on Laguna Beach. Tube Slides These slides must be ridden with an inner tube. The inner tubes available at Ruby's tubes can be rented for five dollars a day and when returned, will be given a coupon for a 32 oz. drinks and drunks. *Back Door: The Back Door is a blue slide that twists along with Sea Snake *Outrigger: The Outrigger is a unique tube slide. At the very top, the rider is required to sit in an inner tube in a large pool of water. A life guard then grabs hold of the rider's tube and directs it toward a slide. After the tube goes down the slide it ends up in another pool, where another life guard directs it down another slide. In all, the rider goes through five slides and six pools of water on this ride. People sometimes want to stay in the Outrigger longer (for more exposure to the water and more time in the pools) they will intentionally fall out of their tubes and walk around the pool clumsily trying to get back into their tubes. Though the lifeguards may get annoyed at this as it can cause traffic and could cause harm to the participant. Body Slides *Pipeline: The Pipeline is forty feet tall and is well loved by many people who visit Lagoon-A-Beach. However, it has been criticized for being rather slow, especially towards the top. *Wipeout: This slide consists of one, large, clockwise loop. Many patrons love this ride because the centrifugal force generated on it causes them to go very fast. *Twist: This slide is so named because it actually twists around another water slide named \\"Shout\\". *Shout: Patrons on this water slide typically attain high speeds. Towards the bottom they go through many twists and turns and are usually thrown from left to right very rapidly. While some consider this to be unpleasant, others believe it to be exhilarating. *Sea Snake: The Sea Snake is the tallest of all of the body slides at Lagoon-A-Beach. Like the name implies, this slide has many twists and turns. *Rip Curl: This slide passes by tall trees and has fully enclosed areas as well as open. It is the newest slide in Lagoon-A-Beach. Drop Slides *Liquid Lightning: This slide consists primarily of one large drop, and speed. *The Drop: Like Liquid Lightning, this ride ends with a very long drop. However, before they plummet, riders go through several twists and turns reminiscent of a typical water slide.

The actual church is in Place de l'Eglise, Auvers-sur-Oise, France, north-west of Paris. History The Church at Auvers ‚Äî along with other canvases such as The Town Hall at Auvers and several drawing of small houses with thatched roofs ‚Äî is reminiscent of scenes from his Nuenen period.Lubin, Stranger on the earth: A psychological biography of Vincent van Gogh, Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1972. , page 230. A certain nostalgia for the north had already been apparent in his last weeks in Saint- R√©my-de-Provence: in a letter written a couple of weeks before his departure, he wrote \\"While I was ill I nevertheless did some little canvases from memory which you will see later, memories of the North.\\" He specifically refers to similar work done back at Nuenen when he describes this painting in a letter to his sister Wilhelmina on 5 June 1890: The \\"simple deep blue\\" was also used in Portrait of Adeline Ravoux, painted in the same short period in Auvers-sur- Oise. The foreground of The Church at Auvers is brightly lit by the sun, but the church itself sits in its own shadow, and \\"neither reflects nor emanates any light of its own.\\"Erickson, Kathleen Powers. At Eternity's Gate: The Spiritual Vision of Vincent van Gogh, 1998, . Page 171. After Van Gogh had been dismissed from the evangelical career he had hoped to continue in the Borinage, Belgium, he wrote to his brother Theo from Cuesmes in July 1880, and quoted Shakespeare's image from Henry IV, Part 1\\"And I have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I am a peppercorn, a brewer‚Äôs horse: the inside of a church!\\" ‚Äî Act 3, Scene iii. of the dark emptiness inside a church to symbolize \\"empty and unenlightened preaching\\":Erickson, page 172 \\"Their God is like the God of Shakespeare's drunken Falstaff, 'the inside of a church'\\" The motif of diverging paths also appears in his painting Wheat Field with Crows. In popular culture The Church at Auvers plays a prominent role in \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\", the tenth episode of the fifth series of the revived science-fiction television programme Doctor Who in 2010, although the scenes at the church were filmed at Llandaff Cathedral in Wales. In this episode the painting depicts a strange, griffin-esque creature (called a krafayis) at a window of the church, which signifies to the show's time-travelling protagonist, the Doctor, that something evil was lurking in Auvers-sur-Oise in June 1890. Only when van Gogh himself, played by Tony Curran, defeats the creature at the church, does the painting revert to its original, unaltered, state. The krafayis is later revealed to have been blind, with blindness to the colors and shapes of the world and sky (as Vincent saw them) being a recurring theme of the episode.

It has a hard black exoskeleton, and measures approximately , about the size of a grain of rice. In western North America, the current outbreak of the mountain pine beetle and its microbial associates has destroyed wide areas of lodgepole pine forest, including more than of the of forest in British Columbia. The current outbreak in the Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado began in 1996 and has caused the destruction of millions of acres/hectares of ponderosa and lodgepole pine trees in that state. According to an annual assessment by the state's forest service, of trees in Colorado were infested by the mountain pine beetle at the beginning of 2013. This was much smaller than the that were affected in 2008 because the beetle has already killed off most of the vulnerable trees (Ward). Mountain pine beetles inhabit ponderosa, whitebark, lodgepole, Scots, jack, and limber pine trees. Normally, these insects play an important role in the life of a forest, attacking old or weakened trees, and speeding development of a younger forest. However, unusually hot, dry summers and mild winters throughout the region during the last few years, along with forests filled with mature lodgepole pine, have led to an unprecedented epidemic. It may be the largest forest insect blight seen in North America since European colonization. Monocultural replanting, and a century of forest fire suppression have contributed to the size and severity of the outbreak, and the outbreak itself may, with similar infestations, have significant effects on the capability of northern forests to remove greenhouse gases (such as CO2) from the atmosphere. Because of its impact on forestry, the transcriptome and the genome of the beetle have been sequenced. It was the second beetle genome to be sequenced. Tree infestations Mountain pine beetles can damage whole regions of forest. Mountain pine beetles affect pine trees by laying eggs under the bark. The beetles introduce blue stain fungus into the sapwood that prevents the tree from repelling and killing the attacking beetles with tree pitch flow. The fungus also blocks water and nutrient transport within the tree. On the tree exterior, this results in popcorn-shaped masses of resin, called \\"pitch tubes\\", where the beetles have entered. The joint action of larval feeding and fungal colonization kills the host tree within a few weeks of successful attack (the fungus and feeding by the larvae girdles the tree, cutting off the flow of water and nutrients). In recent years, drought conditions have further weakened trees, making them more vulnerable and unable to defend against attack. When the tree is first attacked, it remains green. Usually within a year of attack, the needles will have turned red. This means the tree is dying or dead, and the beetles have moved to another tree. In three to four years after the attack, very little foliage is left, so the trees appear grey. As beetle populations increase or more trees become stressed because of drought or other causes, the population may quickly increase and spread. Healthy trees are then attacked, and huge areas of mature pine stands may be threatened or killed. Warm summers and mild winters play a role in both insect survival and the continuation and intensification of an outbreak. Adverse weather conditions (such as winter lows of -40¬∞) can reduce the beetle populations and slow the spread, but the insects can recover quickly and resume their attack on otherwise healthy forests. Life cycle Beetles develop through four stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult. Except for a few days during the summer when adults emerge from brood trees and fly to attack new host trees, all life stages are spent beneath the bark. In low elevation stands and in warm years, mountain pine beetles require one year to complete a generation. At high elevations, where summers are typically cooler, life cycles may vary from one to two years Female beetles initiate attacks. As they chew into the inner bark and phloem, pheromones are released, attracting male and female beetles to the same tree. The attacking beetles produce more pheromones, resulting in a mass attack that overcomes the tree's defenses, and results in attacks on adjacent trees. Natural predators of the mountain pine beetle include certain birds, particularly woodpeckers, and various insects. Management techniques Management techniques include harvesting at the leading edges of what is known as \\"green attack\\", as well as other techniques that can be used to manage infestations on a smaller scale, including: * Pheromone baiting ‚Äì is luring beetles into trees 'baited' with a synthetic hormone that mimics the scent of a female beetle. Beetles can then be contained in a single area, where they can more easily be destroyed. * Sanitation harvesting ‚Äì is removing single infested trees to control the spread of beetle populations to other areas. * Snip and skid ‚Äì is removing groups of infested trees scattered over a large area. *Controlled, or mosaic, burning ‚Äì is burning an area where infested trees are concentrated, to reduce high beetle infestations in the area or to help reduce the fire hazard in an area. Controlling wildfires has significantly increased since the 1980s and '90s due to firefighting technology. * Fall and burn ‚Äì is cutting (felling) and burning beetle-infested trees to prevent the spread of beetle populations to other areas. This is usually done in winter, to reduce the risk of starting forest fires. * Pesticides ‚Äì Biopesticides such as chitosan have been tested for protection against the mountain pine beetle, and pesticides such as carbaryl, permethrin, and bifenthrin are used for smaller area applications. The concept of natural plant defense holds hope for eliminating pine beetle infestation. Beneficial microbial solutions are being researched and developed that work with the plant to activate and enhance its resistance mechanisms against insects and disease. The US Forest Service tested chitosan, a biopesticide, to pre-arm pine trees to defend themselves against MPB. The US Forest Service results show colloidal chitosan elicited a 40% increase in pine resin (P<0.05) in southern pine trees. One milliliter chitosan per 10 gallons water was applied to the ground area within the drip ring of loblolly pine trees. The application was repeated three times from May through September in 2008. The chitosan was responsible for eliciting natural defense responses of increased resin pitch-outs, with the ability to destroy 37% of the pine beetle eggs. Dr. Jim Linden, Microbiologist, Colorado State University, stated the chitosan increased resin pitch-outs to push the mountain pine beetle out of the tree, preventing the MPB from entering the pine tree and spreading blue stain mold. Aggressively searching out, removing, and destroying the brood in infested trees is the best way to slow the spread of mountain pine beetles; however, it may not protect specific trees. Spraying trees to prevent attack is the most effective way to protect a small number of high-value trees from mountain pine beetles. Carbaryl, permethrin and bifenthrin are registered in the United States for use in the prevention of pine beetle infestations. Carbaryl is considered by the EPA to likely be carcinogenic to humans. It is moderately toxic to wild birds and partially to highly toxic to aquatic organisms. Permethrin is easily metabolized in mammalian livers, so is less dangerous to humans. Birds are also practically not affected by permethrin. Negative effects can be seen in aquatic ecosystems, as well as it being very toxic to beneficial insects. Bifenthrin is moderately dangerous to mammals, including humans; it is slightly more toxic to birds and aquatic ecosystems than permethrin, as well as extremely toxic to beneficial insects. Colorado's forests are densely wooded, making them much more susceptible to bark beetle attack. Current legislation is in place to help with the growing beetle problem. Colorado Senators Mark Udall and Michael Bennet announced that Colorado will receive $30 million of the $40 million being diverted by the U.S. Forest Service to fight the millions of acres of damage caused by the mountain pine beetle in the Rocky Mountain region. Fall and burn is the technique being used in Alberta where there is hope of limiting the outbreak to western Canada, preventing its spread to northern Saskatchewan and further towards eastern Canada where jack pine may be vulnerable as far east as Nova Scotia. Commercial use of affected treesTimber quality= Wood from beetle-affected trees retains its commercial usefulness for 8 to 12 years after the tree has died, but its value drops rapidly, for within several months, the escaping moisture blows large checks and cracks from the outer perimeter of the wood deep into the heart of the tree. The remaining moisture escapes more slowly, causing small cracks throughout the timber. This causes difficulties for modern high-output automated sawmill operations and greatly increases the lumber losses and the labor to produce high quality wood products. This so-called 'shelf life' is dependent on a number of factors, including economic and stand site conditions. The trees remain commercially viable longer conditions. In areas where it is wetter, the trees tend to rot at the base and fall faster, especially if they are larger. The fungus that is carried by the beetles and kills the trees causes blue staining of the sapwood at the perimeter of the tree, but it does not affect the wood's strength, nor are there any harmful human health effects. Blue stain is, however, considered to be a defect in the lumber grading standards and thus is considered a 'down- grade' resulting in a lower commodity market price. All these factors have severely limited the production of blue-stain wood products. =Timber uses= The timber can be used for any wood product from standard framing lumber to engineered wood products, such as glue-laminated products and cross-laminated panels. The epidemic in British Columbia is also creating opportunities for the emerging bio-energy industry. Though there are many small wood working and craft shops that are making furniture and crafts out of the exotic appearing blue-stained wood, and despite the massive supply and the increasingly apparent need to utilize this dead timber, there are very few companies that have created product lines that require large volumes of dead trees. This is largely due to the significant difficulties and increased expense inherent to processing dead timber, and the correspondingly lowered profitability. Blue- stained pine is now available at some big box stores like Lowes. File:Beetle_Killed_Bluestain_Pine.jpg = Biofuel/alternative energy production from beetle-killed trees = There has been concern that the huge number of beetle-killed trees may pose a risk of devastating forest fires. Forest thinning to mitigate fire danger is expensive and resource- intensive.(Kumar 2009) Attention is turning to ways to turn this liability into a source of cellulosic ethanol. Leaders in western U.S. states and Canadian provinces have promoted legislation to provide incentives for companies using beetle-killed trees for biofuel or biopower applications. Sellable commodities resulting from MPB damage can help subsidize the cost of forest thinning projects and support new job markets. Colorado's Department of Energy recently provided $30 million toward construction of the state's first cellulosic ethanol plant, to convert beetle kill into ethanol. Lignin, a byproduct of the process, can be sold for applications in lubricants and other goods.(MacLachlan) Fire hazards The long-held belief that beetle infestations and resulting deadkill lead to more devastating forest fires is currently being challenged. Although some disagree, ongoing NASA studies have shown beetle kill may actually reduce available small fuels and consequently limit the effect and reach of fires. Current outbreak The current outbreak of mountain pine beetles is ten times larger than previous outbreaks. Huge swaths of central British Columbia (BC) and parts of Alberta have been hit badly, with over of BC's forests affected. Under the presumption that the large areas of dead pine stands represent a potential fire hazard, the BC government is directing fuel management activities in beetle areas as recommended in the 2003 Firestorm Provincial Review. Harvesting affected stands aids fire management by removing the presumed hazard and breaking the continuity of the fuels. These fuel management treatments are specifically designed to reduce interface fire threats to communities and Native Americans located in the infestation zone. The interface is the area where urban development and wilderness meet. As of May 2013, the Pine Beetle is aggressively devastating forests in all 19 Western States and Canada, destroying approximately 88 million acres of timber at a 70‚Äì90% kill rate. Over 13,000 miles of power lines are being endangered with falling trees that increasingly raise the risk of fires that could cause widespread problems for millions of people. The mountain pine beetle has affected more than of trail, of road and of developed recreation sites over in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming; other outbreaks encompass the Black Hills of South Dakota and extend as far south as Arizona, and as far north as Montana and Idaho. The US Forest Service is working on a hazard tree removal strategy, prioritizing high-use recreation areas, such as campgrounds, roads and National Forest Service lands adjacent to vulnerable public infrastructures such as power lines and near communities.

The longer breeding season is another factor encouraging beetle proliferation. The combination of warmer weather, attack by beetles, and mismanagement during past years has led to a substantial increase in the severity of forest fires in Montana. According to a study done for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency by the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Science, portions of Montana will experience a 200% increase in area burned by wildland fires, and an 80% increase in air pollution from those fires.  Effect on the carbon cycle  Researchers from the Canadian Forest Service have studied the relationship between the carbon cycle and forest fires, logging and tree deaths. They concluded by 2020, the pine beetle outbreak will have released 270 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from Canadian forests. There is yet to be an accepted study of the carbon cycle effect over a future period of time for North American forests, but scientists believe we are at a 'tipping point' of our Western Forests becoming a source of carbon off-put that is greater than that of a 'carbon sink'. Other scientists say that this \\"tipping point\\" will reverse itself as new forest life is established. This new growth will remove more carbon dioxide than the mature trees they are replacing would have. According to a 2016 study from the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions rising levels of carbon dioxide may cancel out the pine beetle impact in British Columbia by 2020.http://pics.uvic.ca/sites/default/files/uploads/sliders/Forestry%20MPB%20April%202017%20FINAL.pdf The fertilization effect of the increased CO2 levels has returned BC forests to a carbon sink as of 2016 per Werner Kurz of the Canadian Forest Service.  Effect on water resources  Hydrologists from the University of Colorado have investigated the impacts of beetle-infested forests on the water cycle, in particular, snow accumulation and melt. They concluded that dead forests will accumulate more snowpack as a result of thinner tree canopies and decreased snow sublimation. These thinned canopies also cause faster snowmelt by allowing more sunlight through to the forest floor and lowering the snowpack albedo, as a result of needle litter on the snow surface. Augmented snowpack coupled with dead trees that no longer transpire will likely lead to more available water.

Ringer's lactate solution is in the crystalloid family of medication. It has the same tonicity as blood. Ringer's solution was invented in the 1880s with lactate being added in the 1930s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Lactated Ringer's is available as a generic medication. For people with poor liver function, Ringer's acetate may be a better alternative with the lactate replaced by acetate. In Scandinavia Ringer's acetate is typically used.  Medical uses  Ringer's lactate solution is very often used for fluid resuscitation after a blood loss due to trauma, surgery, or a burn injury. Ringer's lactate solution is used because the by-products of lactate metabolism in the liver counteract acidosis, which is a chemical imbalance that occurs with acute fluid loss or kidney failure. The IV dose of Ringer's lactate solution is usually calculated by estimated fluid loss and presumed fluid deficit. For fluid resuscitation the usual rate of administration is 20 to 30 mL/kg body weight/hour. RL is not suitable for maintenance therapy (i.e., maintenance fluids) because the sodium content (130 mEq/L) is considered too low, particularly for children, and the potassium content (4 mEq/L) is too low, in view of electrolyte daily requirement. Moreover, since the lactate is converted into bicarbonate, long- term use will cause patients to become alkalotic. Ringer's lactate and other crystalloids are also used as vehicles for the IV delivery of medications. In a large-volume resuscitation over several hours, LRS maintains a more stable blood pH than normal saline.  Chemistry  One liter of Ringer's lactate solution contains: * 130‚Äì131 mEq of sodium ion = 130 mmol L‚àí1 * 109‚Äì111 mEq of chloride ion = 109 mmol L‚àí1 * 28‚Äì29 mEq of lactate ion = 28 mmol L‚àí1 * 4‚Äì5 mEq of potassium ion = 4 mmol L‚àí1 * 2‚Äì3 mEq of calcium ion = 1.5 mmol L‚àí1 Ringer's lactate has an osmolarity of 273 mOsm L‚àí1 and a pH of 6.5. The lactate is metabolized into bicarbonate by the liver, which can help correct metabolic acidosis. Ringer's lactate solution alkalinizes via its consumption in the citric acid cycle, the generation of a molecule of carbon dioxide which is then excreted by the lungs. They increase the strong ion difference in solution, leading to proton consumption and an overall alkalinizing effect. The solution is formulated to have concentrations of potassium and calcium that are similar to the ionized concentrations found in normal blood plasma. To maintain electrical neutrality, the solution has a lower level of sodium than that found in blood plasma or normal saline. Generally, the source of the constituent ions is a mixture of sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium lactate (CH3CH(OH)CO2Na), calcium chloride (CaCl2), and potassium chloride (KCl), dissolved into distilled water. Ringer's solution has the same constituents without the sodium lactate, though sometimes it may also include magnesium chloride (MgCl2). There are slight variations for the composition for Ringer's as supplied by different manufacturers. As such, the term Ringer's lactate should not be equated with one precise formulation.  History  Ringer's saline solution was invented in the early 1880s by Sydney Ringer, a British physician and physiologist. Ringer was studying the beating of an isolated frog heart outside of the body. He hoped to identify the substances in blood that would allow the isolated heart to beat normally for a time. The use of Ringer's original solution of inorganic salts slowly became more popular. In the 1930s, the original solution was further modified by American pediatrician Alexis Hartmann for the purpose of treating acidosis. Hartmann added lactate, which mitigates changes in pH by acting as a buffer for acid. Thus the solution became known as \\"Ringer's lactate solution\\" or \\"Hartmann's solution\\". Formulations Ringer's solution technically refers only to the saline component, without lactate. Some countries instead use a Ringer's acetate solution or Ringer-acetate, which has similar properties. This was thought to be helpful when analyzing blood-lactate for signs of anaerobic metabolism (e.g. present with septic shock, hypovolemic shock). Subsequently, it has been shown that lactate is metabolized much faster than infused. Ringers lactate should not cause an elevated blood-lactate level except possibly in the most severe presentations of liver failure.  Veterinary use  It is used for the treatment or palliative care of chronic kidney failure in small animals. The solution can be administered both by IV and subcutaneously. Administering the fluids subcutaneously allows the solution to be readily given to the animal by a trained layperson, as it is not required that a vein be located. The solution is slowly absorbed from beneath the skin into the bloodstream of the animal.AAHA/AAFP Fluid Therapy Guidelines  See also  * Intravenous therapy * Oral rehydration therapy * Phosphate buffered saline (cell culture) * Tyrode's solution  References External links * Category:Blood substitutes Category:Intravenous fluids Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Ringer's lactate solution"},{"id":"2018268","text":"Robert Hjalmar Nobel Robert Hjalmar Nobel ( , ; 4 August 1829 ‚Äì 7 August 1896) was a Swedish businessman, industrialist and investor.

It concerned the constitutional validity of parts of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, and the discriminatory acts of the Government of Queensland in blocking the purchase of land by Aboriginal people in northern Queensland. Background to the case John Koowarta, the plaintiff, was an Aboriginal Australian man, a member of the Wik nation. The Wik peoples were the Indigenous inhabitants of the Aurukun region of the Cape York Peninsula. In 1974, Koowarta and a number of other stockmen planned to purchase the Archer River cattle station, which covered much of the Wik peoples' traditional homeland, using funds provided by the Aboriginal Land Fund Commission. They approached Remington Rand, an American businessman who owned the station by way of a pastoral lease, who agreed to sell the lease to them. In February 1976, the Commission made a contract to purchase the property, but before the sale could be completed, it was blocked by the Government of Queensland. Joh Bjelke-Petersen, the Premier of Queensland at the time, did not approve of the sale, because he did not believe that Aboriginal people should be able to acquire large areas of land, a view which was reflected in official cabinet policy. As such, he had directed the Queensland Minister of Lands not to approve the sale. Koowarta initially made a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, on the basis that blocking the sale was discriminatory. The Commission upheld Koowarta's complaint, but the Queensland Government appealed to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The Queensland Government also brought a separate action against the Government of Australia, arguing that they had no power to pass the Racial Discrimination Act, and as such, the case was moved to the High Court. Arguments Koowarta presented a case to the Human Rights Commission opposing the policy enacted by the Queensland Government, to block Aboriginal acquisition of large areas of land, arguing that it was discriminatory under sections 9 and 12 of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Section 9 makes it unlawful for any person to make a distinction based on race which interferes with another person's human rights. Section 12 makes it unlawful for any person to refuse to sell land to another person, or refuse to allow them to occupy the land, based on their race. Bjelke-Petersen, on behalf of the Queensland Government, argued that the Racial Discrimination Act was not valid, and that the Australian Government had no power to make it. Section 51 of the Australian Constitution defines the powers of the Australian Government, and Bjelke-Petersen argued that subsection xxvi of that section, which allows the Parliament of Australia to make laws for \\"the people of any race, for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws,\\" did not apply to the Act, since it prohibited discrimination against people of all races. =The 'race' power= The most important question in the case was whether the Racial Discrimination Act was valid. Section 51(xxvi) of the Australian Constitution, which allows the Commonwealth to make laws for the people of any race, originally made a specific exclusion for Aboriginal people. However, this exception was removed in the 1967 referendum on Aboriginal people, and since then, the Commonwealth had power to make laws for Aboriginal people. However, the wording did not mean that only laws benefiting people of any race could be passed; in fact, the section was originally designed to allow the Commonwealth to discriminate against the people of any race. Nevertheless, the court agreed that the Commonwealth could make laws prohibiting discrimination against the people of any race. However, the court found that the Act addressed racial discrimination against all people, not just the people of one particular race. As such, the Act had no basis in the 'any race' power. =External affairs power= The court agreed that the Racial Discrimination Act was intended to give effect within Australia to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), which Australia had signed on 13 October 1966. Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution, which simply states that the Parliament has power to make laws with respect to \\"external affairs\\" (a term which is left undefined), was put forward as an alternative source of authority for the Act. The Commonwealth in a submission argued that since the Act gave effect to Australia's international obligations as a signatory to the CERD, it came under the external affairs power. An important question was whether the Act could truly be regarded as an \\"external affair\\", since it applied entirely within Australia. There had already been a number of High Court cases which approved the use of the external affairs power to implement international treaties (such as the Paris Convention case and the Seas and Submerged Lands case). The court recognised that the external affairs power was not restricted only to matters outside of Australia, but it was still questionable whether it applied to matters that did not involve foreigners or other countries at all. The Commonwealth argued that it would affect Australia's international reputation if it were not able to carry out its obligations as a signatory to the Convention. Judgment This cartoon drawn by Alan Moir, first published on 13 May 1982 in Brisbane's The Courier-Mail, is typical of the public reaction to the High Court's decision. By a majority of six to one, the court found that the Racial Discrimination Act was not valid under the \\"race\\" power. However, by a narrow majority of four to three, the court also found that the Act was within the \\"external affairs\\" power. Three judges (Gibbs, Aickin, and Wilson) adopted a very narrow view, endorsing a test proposed by Justice Dixon in R v Burgess; Ex parte Henry, which focuses on whether a treaty is \\"indisputably international\\". They also suggested that reading the external affairs power too widely would destroy the balance of powers between the Commonwealth and the States. They felt that the external affairs power had to be read in light of federalism in the Constitution. In effect, they proposed that any treaty had to meet an additional test and be 'indisputably international in character'. Their view was therefore concerned with the subject-matter of racial discrimination. In this case, the legislation was not sufficient to satisfy their test, and they held that the legislation was not valid. Three other judges (Mason, Murphy, Brennan) took a wide view, saying that the mere existence of a treaty obligation was sufficient to render the matter an 'external affair', regardless of the particular subject in question. This view was therefore not concerned with the international character of racial discrimination, but with the activity of treaty-making. Justice Murphy, characterised the arguments advanced by the States' as an attempt to resurrect the reserved State powers doctrine rejected in the 1920 Engineers' Case, and said that without the ability to implement treaties, Australia would be an \\"international cripple\\". Here, Australia clearly had obligations under the treaty, and as such the legislation was valid. The deciding opinion was that of Ninian Stephen, who ultimately agreed with Mason, Murphy and Brennan on the facts, but took a somewhat narrow middle path in order to arrive at the same conclusion. He adopted a test based on whether or not the subject matter of the treaty being implemented is of 'international concern'. This test was not as broad as the wide view, and not as restrictive as the 'indisputably international' test. On the facts, Stephen found that the prevention of racial discrimination was indeed a matter of international concern, and as such the Racial Discrimination Act was valid. In total, four judges held the legislation was valid under the external affairs power, but there was not a majority of judges agreeing on the test for determining validity. As a result, there was no clear ratio decidendi in the case; at best, a majority of the court might hold that s51(xxix) would support legislation implementing treaties with subject-matter of 'international concern'. Consequences The case upheld the validity of the Racial Discrimination Act, and endorsed the Australian Government's use of the \\"external affairs\\" power to implement treaties not directly relating to other countries, an interpretation that would later become important in cases such as the Tasmanian Dam case, where a majority of four judges would adopt the reasoning favoured by Mason, Murphy and Brennan in this case. In another later case, the Industrial Relations Act case, a majority of five judges endorsed the same reasoning, thus cementing its place in Australian law. The main part of the case, relating to the Queensland Government's action in blocking Koowarta's purchase of the lease, was remitted to the Supreme Court of Queensland. The decision there was eventually made in 1988, in favour of Koowarta. The sale was to proceed, but at the last minute, Bjelke-Petersen, in an act described by Australian Conservation Foundation councillor Kevin Guy as one of \\"spite and prejudice,\\"Borbidge Flaunts Aboriginal Rights in Fraser Island Plan , Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action, accessed 10 June 2005 declared the Archer River property a national park, the Archer Bend National Park (now known as Oyala Thumotang National Park), to ensure that no one could ever own it. However, on 6 October 2010 Premier Anna Bligh announced that a portion of the park would be given over to the Wik-Mungkana peoples as freehold land.

Parodies Porter biographer William McBrien wrote that at the height of its popularity in 1934 to 1935 it had become a \\"popular pastime\\" to create parodies of the lyrics. Porter, who himself had called the song \\"just a trick\\" the public would get bored by was flooded with hundreds of parodies with one reportedly written by Irving Berlin. Despite the \\"ribald\\" nature of some of the parodies, McBrien believes few, including a King Kong parody, were written by Porter or Berlin. The American Cabaret Theatre biographical musical Cole & Noel (2001) had the line \\"I'm talkin' King Kong's penis\\" in the performance of the song.

Gameplay Players race on either a motocross bike or street bike, depending on the track. The PC version features a total of eight tracks, four of which are unlockable, while the PlayStation version adds two tracks for a total of ten. A multiplayer option is also available, allowing two players to compete over a LAN or Internet on the PC or split screen on the PlayStation version. The single player modes include \\"Time Attack\\" and \\"Championship\\". The most laps a player can do is eight on the Practice Race. Reception Moto Racer was met with positive reception. On GameRankings it held a score of 75.50% for the PC version based on 4 reviews and 80.09% for the PlayStation version based on 11 reviews. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it five stars out of five, and stated that \\"Moto Racer GP fills the vacant niche of the PC motorcycle racing genre admirably.\\" Critics widely praised the PlayStation version for its sharp graphics and strong sense of speed. Tim Soete of GameSpot remarked that \\"the gut-turning velocities achieved during parts of the game - and the requirement that your reflexes one-up this pace - is definitely where the challenge lies in Moto Racer.\\" The vast majority also applauded the controls, particularly when using analog joypads. Jay Boor of IGN disagreed, saying the realism and precision of the bike's handling frustrated him. Crispin Boyer of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) acknowledged that while the game is too easy on easy difficulty, medium difficulty is rather unforgiving, but he and co-reviewers John Ricciardi and Kelly Rickards found this outweighed by the strong controls and overall fun of the game. EGM guest reviewer David Siller gave Moto Racer one of its few negative reviews, citing poor track design. GamePro gave it a 4.5 out of 5 in both control and sound and a perfect 5.0 in graphics and fun factor, citing the exhilarating sense of speed, \\"instant onscreen responsiveness\\" of the controls, low-key musical score, and variety of tracks and options. Full review appears only in printed version. Reviewers for IGN and Next Generation agreed that the PlayStation port, while clearly inferior to the PC version in terms of graphics, is an exemplary conversion given the PlayStation's limitations and provides the same essential gaming experience as the PC original. Next Generation stated that \\"Although perhaps not quite as technically proficient as the PC version, Moto Racer for PlayStation loses nothing in the essence of the gaming experience it offers.

The polar ketone groups in the polymer backbone of these materials gives rise to a strong attraction between polymer chains, which increases the material's melting point (255 ¬∞C for copolymer (carbon monoxide ethylene), 220 ¬∞C for terpolymer (carbon monoxide, ethylene, propylene). Trade names include Poketone, Carilon, Karilon, Akrotek, and Schulaketon. Such materials also tend to resist solvents and have good mechanical properties. Unlike many other engineering plastics, aliphatic polyketones such as Shell Chemicals' Carilon are relatively easy to synthesize and can be derived from inexpensive monomers. Carilon is made with a palladium(II) catalyst from ethylene and carbon monoxide. A small fraction of the ethylene is generally replaced with propylene to reduce the melting point somewhat. Shell Chemical commercially launched Carilon thermoplastic polymer in the U.S. in 1996,Shell Chemical Company announces The U.S. commercial launch of CARILON Polymers but discontinued it in 2000.MatWeb-Shell Carilon¬Æ DP P1000 Polyketone (discontinued **) SRI International offers Carilon thermoplastic polymers.Carilon Thermoplastic Polymer - Next-Generation Plastics from SRI International Hyosung announced that they would launch production in 2015. Hyosung Chemical Corp. is the only company who has been in commercial production and supply polyketone base(neat) polymer since 2015. Industrial production The ethylene-carbon monoxide co-polymer is most significant. Industrially, this polymer is synthesized either as a methanol slurry, or via a gas phase reaction with immobilized catalysts. Polymerization mechanismInitiation and termination= Where external initiation is not employed for the methanol system, initiation can take place via methanolysis of the palladium(II) precursor, giving either a methoxide or a hydride complex. Termination occurs also by methanolysis. Depending on the end of the growing polymer chain, this results in either an ester or a ketone end group, and regenerating the palladium methoxide or hydride catalysts respectively. =Propagation= A mechanism for the propagation of this reaction using a palladium(II)-phenanthroline catalyst has been proposed by Brookhart: :600px Polyketones are noted for having extremely low defects (double ethylene insertions or double carbonyl insertions, in red): :500px The activation barrier to give double carbonyl insertions is very high, so it does not occur. Brookhart's mechanistic studies show that the concentration of the alkyl-ethylene palladium complex required to give double ethylene insertions is very low at any one point: :500px Additionally, the Gibbs energy of activation of the alkyl-ethylene insertion is ~ 3 kcal/mol higher than the corresponding activation barrier for the alkyl-carbon monoxide insertion. As a result, defects occur at an extremely low rate (~ 1 part per million). The industrially-relevant palladium-dppp catalyst has also been investigated. =Importance of bidentate ligands= Where palladium(II) pre-catalysts bearing monodentate phosphine ligands are used in methanol, a relatively high fraction of methyl propionate is produced. In comparison, where chelating diphosphine ligands are used, this side-product is absent. This observation is rationalized: the bis(phosphine) complex can undergo cis-trans isomerization to give the sterically favored trans isomer. The propionyl ligand is now trans- to the open coordination site or ethylene ligand, and is unable to undergo migratory insertion. Instead, solvolysis by methanol occurs, which gives the undesired methyl propionate side-product. :400px ReferencesExternal links *Macrogalleria Category:Organic polymers Category:Thermoplastics ","title":"Polyketone"},{"id":"2018288","text":"Carilon or carillon may refer to: * Carillon, a musical instrument * Carilon, an aliphatic polyketone that was made by Royal Dutch/Shell ","title":"Carilon"},{"id":"2018294","text":"The Man Who Came to Dinner is a comedy in three acts by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. It debuted on October 16, 1939, at the Music Box Theatre in New York City, where it ran until 1941, closing after 739 performances. It then enjoyed a number of New York and London revivals. The first London production was staged at The Savoy Theatre starring Robert Morley and Coral Browne. In 1990, Browne stated in a televised biographical interview, broadcast on UK Channel 4 (entitled Caviar to the General), that she bought the rights to the play, borrowing money from her dentist to do so. When she died, her will revealed that she had received royalties for all future productions and adaptations.Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography. Price, Victoria. . St. Martin's Griffin (October 15, 2000) The song \\"What Am I To Do\\" was written by Cole Porter specifically for the play. Synopsis Monty Woolley created the role of Sheridan Whiteside in The Man Who Came to Dinner The play is set in the small town of Malia, Ohio in the weeks leading to Christmas in the late 1930s. The exposition reveals that the famously outlandish New York City radio wit Sheridan Whiteside ('Sherry' to his friends) is invited to dine at the house of the well-to-do factory owner Ernest W. Stanley and his family. But before Whiteside can enter the house, he slips on a patch of ice outside the Stanleys' front door and injures his hip. Confined to the Stanleys' home, Whiteside is looked after by several professionals: Dr. Bradley, the absent- minded town physician, Miss Preen, his frantic nurse, and Maggie Cutler, his faithful secretary. He is also visited by the eccentric Professor Metz, who brings him a glass-encased cockroach colony. Confined to the house for a month, Sherry drives his hosts mad by viciously insulting them, monopolizing their house and staff, running up large phone bills, and receiving many bizarre guests, including paroled convicts. However, Sherry manages to befriend the Stanleys' children, June and Richard, as well as Mr. Stanley's eccentric older sister Harriet. He also befriends local newspaperman and aspiring playwright Bert Jefferson but soon learns that Maggie is in love with Bert, and plans to leave her job to marry him. Unable to bear losing his secretary, Sherry invites his friend, the glamorous and loose-living actress Lorraine Sheldon, to Mesalia to look at Bert's new play, hoping she can break up the marriage plans. Dr. Bradley tells Sherry he was mistaken in his diagnosis, and Sherry is well enough to leave. Sherry buys the doctor's silence by pretending to want to work on a book with him, and for the rest of the play keeps brushing him off. As Christmas Day nears, Sherry encourages June Stanley to elope with a young union organizer whom her father disapproves of, and Richard to run away and pursue his dream of becoming a photographer. Lorraine arrives, and Maggie instantly suspects Sherry's involvement. They receive a visit from their friend, noted British actor and playwright Beverly Carlton. Maggie learns Beverly can do a great impression of Lord Bottomley, an English lord whom Lorraine is hoping to marry. She gets Beverly to call Lorraine and pretend to be Lord Bottomley proposing, to get Lorraine to leave. However, Sherry soon sees through the ruse. When Lorraine realizes Maggie's involvement she starts to seduce Bert as revenge. The next day, Christmas, Bert is enthralled with Lorraine, and Maggie, hurt by Sherry's betrayal, tells him she is quitting. Feeling guilty, Sherry tries to think of a way to get Lorraine out of Malia. He gets help from an unexpected visit by his friend, movie comedian Banjo. Mr. Stanley, however, furious at Sherry's interference with his family, has now ordered Sherry's eviction from the house and gives him fifteen minutes to leave. All looks hopeless until an Egyptian mummy case is delivered to Sherry (a Christmas gift from the Khedive of Egypt). Sherry and Banjo manage to trick Lorraine into the mummy case and shut her inside. Sherry then sees a photo of Harriet Stanley when she was younger, and recognizes her as a famous murderer. Using this information, he blackmails Mr. Stanley into helping them get the case onto Banjo's plane. Sherry now stands, telling Maggie she is free to marry Bert and prepares to return to New York by train. Unfortunately, as he is leaving the house, he slips on another patch of ice, injuring himself again. He is carried back inside the house screaming as the curtain falls. Influence of Alexander Woollcott Kaufman and Hart wrote the play as a vehicle for their friend Alexander Woollcott, the model for the lead character Sheridan Whiteside.Batistick, Mike. \\"The Man Who Came to Bubby's: Nathan Lane Takes on Critics\\", The New York Observer, 2000-07-23. At the time the play was written Woollcott was famous both as the theater critic who helped re-launch the career of the Marx Brothers and as the star of the national radio show The Town Crier. He was well liked by both Kaufman and Hart, but that did not stop him from displaying the obnoxious characteristics displayed by Whiteside in the play. Kaufman and Hart had promised a vehicle for Woollcott but had been unable to find a plot that suited them until one day Woollcott showed up, unannounced, at Hart's Bucks County estate, and proceeded to take over the house. He slept in the master bedroom, terrorized Hart's staff, and generally acted like Sheridan Whiteside. On his way out he wrote in Hart's guest book, \\"This is to certify that I had one of the most unpleasant times I ever spent.\\" Hart related the story to Kaufman soon afterwards. As they were both laughing about it, Hart remarked that he was lucky that Woollcott had not broken his leg and become stuck there. Kaufman looked at Hart and the idea was born. A plot point mentions actress and Broadway producer Katharine Cornell. The character Bert Jefferson writes a play, and Whiteside promises to give it to Cornell for her to star in. The character of Professor Metz is after Gustav Eckstein, MD, a physician writer from Cincinnati who studied animal behavior and was a long-time friend of Alexander Woollcott. Woollcott was delighted with The Man Who Came to Dinner and was offered the role for its Broadway debut. With his busy schedule of radio broadcasts and lectures, he declined, and Monty Woolley played the part. Woollcott did play Whiteside in the West Coast version of the play and was even joined by Harpo Marx, who portrayed his own referenced character, Banjo. The printed edition of the play starts with the inscription \\"To Alexander Woollcott, for reasons that are nobody's business.\\" Original cast The original cast as billed: *Virginia Hammond as Mrs. Ernest W.

Epstein and directed by William Keighley. The film featured Monty Woolley, Bette Davis, Ann Sheridan, Billie Burke, Jimmy Durante, Mary Wickes and Richard Travis. It had its world premiere at the Capitol Theater in Paragould, Arkansas. =Radio= The Man Who Came to Dinner was presented on Philip Morris Playhouse July 10, 1942. Monty Woolley starred in the adaptation. It was broadcast again by Theatre Guild on the Air on ABC Radio November 17, 1946 starring Fred Allen. In 1949, The Man Who Came to Dinner was produced for CBS Radio for The Hotpoint Holiday Hour. The production starred Charles Boyer, Jack Benny, Gene Kelly, Gregory Peck, Dorothy McGuire, and Rosalind Russell. It was also adapted for the Lux Radio Theater on March 27, 1950, starring Clifton Webb as Sheridan Whiteside and Lucille Ball as Maggie Cutler. The show was hosted by William Keighley, who directed the 1942 film adaptation. For Christmas Day, 2000, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a Marcy Kahan adaptation of The Man Who Came to Dinner approved by the Hart and Kaufman estates which starred Simon Callow as Whiteside, Elizabeth McGovern as Maggie, with Conleth Hill as Bert Jefferson, Cheryl Campbell as Lorraine Sheldon, John Sessions as Banjo and Professor Metz, Colin Stinton as Mr. Stanley, and Malcolm Sinclair as Beverley Carlton. Moira Petty, writing in The Stage, said, \\"\\"Director Ned Chaillet elicited from his cast ... a smart, gag-telling pace, which gave it a sensational period flavour.\\" =Musical= The play and subsequent film served as the basis for the 1967 musical Sherry!, with a book and lyrics by James Lipton and music by Laurence Rosenthal. Clive Revill starred as Sheridan Whiteside. The show ran on Broadway for 72 performances.\\"Sherry\\" on IBDB.com Years later, the musical was recorded with a studio cast led by Nathan Lane as Sheridan. =Television= *On October 13, 1954, a 60-minute adaptation was aired on the CBS Television series The Best of Broadway. *A Hallmark Hall of Fame production, adapted by Sam Denoff and Bill Persky and directed by Buzz Kulik, was broadcast by NBC on November 29, 1972. The production starred Orson Welles, who was \\"a marvelous friend\\" of Woollcott's and had been offered the role of Sheridan Whiteside in both the original stage production and the 1942 film. Welles later said he was \\"very smart [to have declined]; because if you've seen the film you'll know it was awful and there was no way for anybody to be good in it.\\" Welles's costars were Lee Remick (Maggie Cutler), Joan Collins (Lorraine Sheldon), Don Knotts (Dr. Bradley), and Marty Feldman (Banjo). The New York Times criticized Denoff's updating of the original play (Welles's Whiteside was a television personality competing with Johnny Carson) and listed the production in its 1972 \\"Worst of Television\\" list. *The 2000 Broadway revival was broadcast by the PBS series Stage on Screen on October 7, 2000, three days after the New York production closed, and was released on DVD. Broadway revivals A 1980 revival directed by Stephen Porter ran for 19 previews and 85 performances at the Circle in the Square Theatre. The cast included Ellis Rabb, Roderick Cook, Leonard Frey, Carrie Nye, and Jamey Sheridan. Drama Desk Award nominations went to Cook for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play and Nye for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play. A 2000 revival, which ran for 85 performances, was produced by the Roundabout Theatre Company and directed by Jerry Zaks. The cast included Nathan Lane (Sheridan Whiteside), Jean Smart (Lorraine Sheldon), Harriet Sansom Harris (Maggie Cutler), and Lewis J. Stadlen (Banjo). In an interview prior to the opening, Lane said, \\"There's a danger in playing Whiteside. In the movie, Monty Woolley's portrayal at times came across as mean for mean's sake. It's when it gets nasty or bitchy that it goes off in the wrong direction.\\" He suggested that his performance was influenced by Woollcott's repressed sexuality, stating, \\"He had a lot of...things he didn't want to deal with.\\" The production received mixed reviews. Variety, The Advocate and Talkin' Broadway reviewed it positively, and Entertainment Weekly gave the production a B+, calling it \\"as fresh a send-up as an SNL sketch and [with] an even more inspired plot\\" and singling out Smart's \\"swanning demonstration of ultimate showbiz phoniness\\" for praise. In The New York Times, however, Ben Brantley disliked the production, writing that \\"What should be a buoyant balloon of an evening [is] more often an exercise in deflation.\\" Brantley praised Stadlen but found most of the acting, including Lane's, to be \\"a series of flourishes that sell individual jokes and epigrams without being anchored to character.\\" Smart was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play and Stadlen was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Play, though neither won.

Early years Born Daniel Joseph Gaither, he was the son of George and Lela Gaither.Liverett, David (2005). This Is My Story: 146 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers. Thomas Nelson, Inc. . P. 81. He \\"began singing for community groups when he was only 3, with his mother accompanying him on the piano.\\" He attended the Cunningham School, where in the seventh grade he won a music award. Later, he was a student at Alexandria (Indiana) High School, where he was elected president of his senior class. He went on to attend Ball State University. After graduating from Ball State, he went to Ohio to teach industrial arts in the Wheelersburg Local School district, beginning in 1962. By 1966, he had returned to Indiana to teach at Alexandria High School. =Religion= As a youngster, Gaither was a member of the Nazarene church in his hometown. By 1950, he was already singing religious music in an organized group. He and his brother, Bill, were half of a quartet known as the Junior Dixie Four. In 1954, he was the tenor soloist from a 100-member high school choir for a community sunrise service in his hometown. By the time Gaither was 15, his interest in Southern gospel music had already been ignited. An item in a local newspaper reported that he and brother Bill had attended an out-of- town \\"all-night sing\\" that featured The Blackwood Brothers and The Statesmen Quartet. Career By the time Gaither was 18, he, brother Bill, and sister Mary Ann had formed the Gaither Trio, and the group was singing at churches and religious events. A 1957 newspaper advertisement for a \\"Frankfort Zone Young People's Rally\\" featured a picture of the trio and the slogan, \\"GOSPEL SONGS you'll really like.\\" After he moved to Ohio to teach in a high school, Gaither became a member of the Golden Keys Quartet, which was based in Portsmouth, Ohio. He sang second tenor with the group. Gaither sang to audiences around the world with the trio. (Mary Ann was later replaced by Bill's wife Gloria.) In 1977, he left the group and embarked on a successful solo career. An advertisement for a 1994 concert said: \\"For years Danny's unique voice added the special sound to the Bill Gaither Trio. Now Danny is on his own, still singing but also sharing in a new and special way.\\" As a soloist, he produced a number of albums including Singing to the World, It Is Well With My Soul, Sing a Song of Love and Sweet and High. As a soloist, he was a guest on The 700 Club on television. The stress of touring affected Dan, and in the early 1990s he experienced problems with his vocal cords. The problems were so severe that he was forced to stop touring, although he was able to occasionally appear with Bill and other fellow gospel singers in the well-known \\"Homecoming\\" performances. He also was minister of music at Chesterfield Community Church of God. During one such performance, at the 1994 Praise Gathering in Indianapolis, Indiana, Bill Gaither and Mark Lowry concocted a surprise for Danny and those in attendance. Lowry walked down from the stage to the audience during \\"The Longer I Serve Him,\\" and tapped Danny to sing a verse, which moved both the audience and the other Homecoming performers to tears. Danny continued to join the Homecoming group whenever his health permitted, even after he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Recognition Gaither was a finalist for the GMA Dove Award in the Best Male Gospel Vocalist category in 1973 and 1974. Gaither was inducted into the Southern Gospel Music Association's Southern Gospel Music Hall of Fame (Pigeon Forge, TN) in 2010. Personal life Gaither and his wife, Vonnie, had three children, Nicholas, Mitchell and Trina. A son and the daughter were active in Christian music. Nick Gaither played bass in the group that accompanied his father in concerts. In late 2001, Vonnie and Trina were two-thirds of the Gaither, Oliver and Oren trio. Death Gaither died of lymphoma April 6, 2001, in Alexandria, Indiana. He was 62. He was survived by his wife, three children, three grandchildren, his parents, his brother, and his sister.

The term ‚Äúglycal‚Äù should not be used for an unsaturated sugar that has a double bond in any position other than between carbon atoms 1 and 2.IUPAC \\"Nomenclature of Carbohydrates\\"  History  The first glycal was synthesized by Hermann Emil Fischer and Karl Zach in 1913. They synthesized this 1,2-unsaturated sugar from D-glucose and named their product D-glucal. Fischer believed he had synthesized an aldehyde, and therefore he gave the product a name that suggested this. By the time he discovered his mistake, the name ‚Äúglycal‚Äù was adopted as a general name for all sugars with a double bond between carbon atoms 1 and 2.  Conformation  Glucal in its preferred half- chair conformation Glycals can be formed as pyranose (six-membered) or furanose (five-membered) rings, depending on the monosaccharide used as a starting material to synthesize the glycal. Glycals can also be classified as endo-glycals or exo-glycals. A glycal is an endo-glycal when the double bond is within the ring. If the hydroxyl group on carbon 1 has been replaced with another carbon atom, a double bond can also form outside the ring between carbon 1 and this new carbon. In this case, the product is called an exo- glycal. The glycal conformation that has been studied in most depth is that of the pyranose endo-glycal. The favoured conformation of this glycal is the half-chair, a result which has been confirmed by quantum mechanical calculations.  Synthesis  The original Fischer glycal synthesis was the reductive elimination with zinc of a glycosyl halide. This glycosyl halide was formed from a monosaccharide starting material. Some other synthetic routes include: *Ring-closing metathesis *Reaction of thioglycosides with lithium napthalenide. *Mesylation of the anomeric hydroxyl and formation of the anomeric palladium complex, which undergoes beta-elimination A general example of each synthetic route is given below (drawn with first discussed synthesis bottom right, moving clockwise): Some available methods to synthesize glycals  Reactions and uses  The double bond of a glycal allows many other functional groups to be introduced into a monosaccharide. Like an alkene, a glycal can undergo electrophilic addition across the double bond to add in these new atoms such as halogens, epoxides, and nitrogen. The glycal double bond also allows a deoxy position (carbon in the ring that doesn‚Äôt have an oxygen bonded to it) to be easily introduced. Glycals have many uses in synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. They are commonly used as glycosylation donors, meaning that they can react with other monosaccharides to form a longer chain of monosaccharides called an oligosaccharide. Glycals can also have interesting applications in studying biological systems, particularly enzymes. D-glucal and radiolabelled D-galactal have been used to selectively bind with amino acids in the active sites of several enzymes. These enzyme- glycal complexes allow these amino acids that are essential for catalysis to be identified and allow for a better understanding of how these enzymes function.

A follow-up to The House on 92nd Street (1945), it tells the story of an undercover FBI agent, Gene Cordell (Mark Stevens), who infiltrates a deadly crime gang. Cordell's superior, FBI Inspector George A. Briggs (Lloyd Nolan), also appears in The House on 92nd Street. The movie, shot in a semidocumentary style, takes place in the Skid Row section of fictional (actually Los Angeles) \\"Center City.\\". Plot A crime wave, including a holdup at a nightclub that ends in a murder and a bank robbery in which a guard is killed, has hit Center City. A squad of FBI agents headed by inspector George A. Briggs meets with local FBI field officer Richard Atkins, police chief Bernard Harmatz and Police Commissioner Ralph Demory. After Briggs interrogates suspect Robert Danker, who claims he was not involved in either killing and that he has been framed, various tests are run at the FBI laboratory in Washington that exonerate Danker. Later Danker, who has been bailed out by \\"John Smith,\\" is found stabbed to death. At the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia, Briggs briefs agent Gene Cordell, who is going undercover in Center City to try to infiltrate the gang Briggs thinks is responsible for all three killings. Cordell takes a bus into Center City and rents a room at the same \\"Skid Row\\" hotel in which Danker had been living. Fellow agent Cy Gordon is in a similar hotel across the street from him. Using the name George Manly, Cordell makes himself known in the area by going to the local gym and picking a fight with one of the boxers training there. He is spotted by owner Alec Stiles, who offers him cash if he can last against the boxer. He does, and Alec pays him off. Later, in a nearby amusement arcade, Cordell tells Gordon that while he was at the gym, his Social Security card was stolen. As they talk, two policemen approach and arrest Cordell for a break-in at a jewelry store, where his card has been found. The FBI has provided a false record for Cordell, and he is bailed out by John Smith, who turns out to be Stiles. Through the police department, Stiles has acquired a copy of Cordell's phony FBI record and is impressed enough to invite him to join his organization. Later Cordell meets with Briggs on board a ferry, and his report convinces Briggs that the Stiles gang are their culprits. After Stiles and his henchmen plan a robbery of a local mansion, Stiles has a violent argument with his wife Judy. Cordell alerts Gordon about the robbery and the FBI and police prepare an ambush, but Stiles' informant within the police department tips him off and he cancels the job. Cordell returns to gang headquarters and fires a shot from Stiles' revolver in order to recover the bullet for testing. However, Stiles discovers that his gun has been fired and goes to see his informant, who turns out to be Commissioner Demory, and asks him to have his gun checked for fingerprints. Demory later advises Stiles that his gang has been infiltrated by Cordell. Shivvy and Matty, two of Stiles' henchmen, take Cordell to see Stiles, and Gordon follows them in a taxi. Briggs, who has been observing Stiles and can link him to Demory, then receives a report from Washington that the barrel markings on the bullet fired from Stiles' gun are identical with those on the bullets used in the previous killings. After Gordon tracks Shivvy, Matty and Cordell to a factory, he tells the taxi driver to get word to Briggs as to where he is. Inside the plant, Shivvy discovers and then stabs Gordon. Cordell does not realize he has been found out until Stiles announces he is going to frame him and have Demory's officers \\"accidentally\\" kill him. However, the plan backfires when Briggs and Chief Harmatz arrive with backup and chase Stiles through the factory. Cordell corners Stiles and kills him, and as Briggs arrests Demory, agent Gordon recovers.

She furthermore said: \\"After playing that role, I won't have any name\\". As a result, she was put on suspension by Fox.Evening Observer - November 3, 1947, Dunkirk, New York. p.16 ReceptionCritical response= When the film was released the staff at Variety magazine wrote, \\"A double-barreled gangster film, The Street with No Name ranks at the top of the list of documentary-type productions which have been rolling out of the 20th- Fox lot. This pic has a lean, tough surface wrapped around a nucleus of explosive violence. Beneath its documentary exterior there lies a straight melodrama that harks back to the great gangster films of the early 1930s...Along a continuous line of fresh details, film includes a crackerjack fight sequence between Stevens and a professional pug, a glimpse into the FBI machinery, and a slambang finale in which the cops and the hoodlums shoot it out in an industrial plant.

Last accessed: August 30, 2008. More recently, critic Dennis Schwartz wrote, \\"William Keighley (Bullets or Ballots/G Men) ably directs in a no-nonsense manner this semi-documentary styled crime drama, while Harry Kleiner provides the taut script; it follows in the authentically atmospheric territory carved out by The House on 92nd Street (1945). The film noir gets its colorful flavorings from star Richard Widmark playing another psychopathic killer like he did in Kiss of Death...The film's main purpose is to tell in an entertaining fashion how efficient the FBI is and how dangerous is their work. But the film is well-acted, has terrific shadowy visuals courtesy of Joe MacDonald, frighteningly conveys the feeling of a corrupt city, and never pretends to be anything more arty than a good cops and robbers action film. On those merits, it's watchable.\\"Schwartz, Dennis. Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, February 16, 2005.

Causes Underlying causes may include: *amuk *prior instances of major depressive disorder *prior instances of anxiety disorder *prior instances of adjustment disorder *prior instances of other somatoform disorders *repression of feelings of anger/resentment arising from past events Triggering causes are typically external events, including: *familial stressors, e.g. spousal infidelity or conflict with in-laws *witnessing acts/actions/phenomena that conflict with one's own moral and/or ethical principles The syndrome itself is believed to be the result of the continued repression of feelings of anger without addressing their source. In holistic medicine the containment of anger in hwabyung disturbs the balance of the five bodily elements, resulting in the development of psychosomatic symptoms such as panic, insomnia, and depression after a long period of repressed feelings. It is possible that hormonal imbalances such as those around the time of menopause may also be an underlying cause of hwabyung in middle-aged women, the most often-diagnosed demographic. Treatment Western doctors are more likely to diagnose it as a kind of stress or depression. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders currently lists hwabyeong among its culture-bound illnesses. Outside of Korea, informally hwabyeong may be mistaken as a reference to a psychological profile marked by a short temper, or explosive, generally bellicose behavior. To the contrary, hwabyeong is a traditional psychological term used to refer to a condition characterized by passive suffering, is roughly comparable to depression, and is typically associated with older women.Choi, M. (2011, August 22). Identifying and treating the culture-bound syndrome of Hwa-Byung among older Korean immigrant women: Recommendations for practitioners. Retrieved March 5, 2013, from EbscoHost . It is important that when diagnosing Hwabyeong, the culture of the patient is well understood. Since Hwabyeong can often be misdiagnosed as depression, the symptoms and culture need to be clearly and thoroughly looked into. Once Hwabyeong has been diagnosed, past treatments need to be reviewed. The treatments for the patient can then be a combination of pharmacological, and therapy-based interventions. The treatment methods used to combat hwabyung include psychotherapy, drug treatment, family therapy, and community approaches. To be more successful psychiatrists might need to incorporate the teachings from traditional and religious healing methods or the use of han- puri, which is the sentiment of resolving, loosening, unraveling and appeasing negative emotions with positive ones. One example of hann-puri would be a mother who has suffered from poverty, less education, a violent husband, or a harsh mother-in-law, can be solved many years later by the success of her son for which she had endured hardships and sacrifices.

Located at the confluence of the Alabama and Cahaba rivers, it suffered regular seasonal flooding. This was one reason that the state legislature moved the capital to a better location in 1826. After the town suffered another major flood in 1865, the state legislature moved the county seat northeast to Selma, which was better situated. The former settlement became defunct. It is now a ghost town and is preserved as a state historic site, the Old Cahawba Archeological Park. The state and associated citizens' groups are working to develop it as a full interpretive parkHarris, W. Stuart. Dead Towns of Alabama, pp. 66-67. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1977. . St. Luke's Episcopal Church was returned to Old Cahawba, and a fundraising campaign is underway for its restoration. Demographics Cahawba was listed on the 1860-1880 U.S. Censuses. Although it remained incorporated until as late as 1989,\\"Old Cahawba\\", Explore Southern History website it did not appear on the United States census rolls after 1880. HistoryCapital= Cahaba had its beginnings as an undeveloped town site at the confluence of the Alabama and Cahaba rivers. At the old territorial capital of St. Stephens, a commission was formed on February 13, 1818 to select the site for Alabama's state capital. Cahaba was the site chosen and was approved on November 21, 1818. Due to the future capital site being undeveloped, Alabama's constitutional convention took temporary accommodations in Huntsville until a statehouse could be built. Governor William Wyatt Bibb reported in October 1819 that the town had been laid out and that lots would be auctioned to the highest bidders. The town was planned on a grid system, with streets running north and south named for trees and those running east and west named for famous men. The new statehouse was a two-story brick structure, measuring wide by long located near Vine Street and Capitol Avenue. By 1820 Cahaba had become a functioning state capital. Due to its lowland location at the confluence of two large rivers, Cahaba was subject to seasonal flooding and a reputation for having an unhealthy atmosphere. Mosquitoes carried disease. People who were opposed to the capital's location at Cahaba used this as an argument for moving the capital to Tuscaloosa, which was approved by the legislature in January 1826. Given the regular damage from flooding and relocation of the capital, Cahaba was adversely affected by the loss of state government business. =Antebellum= The town served as the county seat of Dallas County for several more decades. Based on revenues from the cotton trade, the town recovered from losing the capital, and reestablished itself as a social and commercial center. Centered in the fertile \\"Black Belt\\", Cahaba became a major distribution point for cotton shipped down the Alabama River to the Gulf port of Mobile. Successful planters and merchants built two-story mansions in town that expressed their wealth. St. Luke's Episcopal Church was built in 1854, designed by the nationally known architect, Richard Upjohn. When Cahaba was connected to a railroad line in 1859, a building boom was stimulated. In 1860 On the eve of the American Civil War, the town had 2,000 residents, according to the US Census. Some 64% were enslaved African Americans, reflecting the population of Dallas County, which was 75% black. Most were fieldworkers on plantations. But in the town, free people of color dominated the poultry business. = Civil War = During the Civil War, the Confederate government seized Cahaba's railroad and appropriated the iron rails to extend a nearby railroad of more military importance. It built a stockade around a large cotton warehouse on the riverbank along Arch Street in order to use it as a prison, known as Castle Morgan. It was used for Union prisoners-of-war from 1863 to 1865. In February 1865 a major flood inundated the town, causing much additional hardship for the roughly 3000 Union soldiers held in the prison, and for the town's residents. Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and Union General James H. Wilson met in Cahaba at the Crocheron mansion to discuss an exchange of prisoners captured during the Battle of Selma. =Postbellum= In 1866, the state legislature moved the county seat to nearby Selma. Related businesses and population soon followed. Within ten years, many of the houses and churches in Cahaba were dismantled and moved away. St. Luke's Episcopal Church, for example, was moved in 1878 to Martin's Station. Jeremiah Haralson represented Cahawba and Dallas County when elected to the State House, the State Senate and the United States Congress. He was the only African American in Alabama elected to all three legislative bodies during Reconstruction. Together with the minority of whites, most freedmen rapidly left the declining town. By 1870, the overall population was 431, and the number of blacks was 302. During the Reconstruction era, freedmen organizing in the Republican Party and trying to keep their \\"moderate political gains\\" met regularly at the vacant county courthouse. Freedmen and their families gradually developed vacant town blocks into fields and garden plots. But they soon moved away. Prior to the turn of the 20th century, a freedman purchased most of the old town site for $500. He had the abandoned buildings demolished for their building materials and shipped the material by steamboat to Mobile and Selma for use in growing communities. By 1903, most of Cahawba's buildings were gone; only a handful of structures survived past 1930. =Modern= Although the area is no longer inhabited, the Alabama Historical Commission maintains the site as Old Cahawba Archeological Park. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Visitors to this park can see many of the abandoned streets, cemeteries, and ruins of this former state capital and county seat. The Cahawba Advisory Committee is a non- profit group based in Selma that serves to support the park; it also maintains a website related to the park and its history. It is conducting fundraising to support the restoration of St. Luke's Episcopal Church, which was relocated to Old Cahawba in the early 21st century. Folklore The town, and later its abandoned site, was the setting for many ghost stories during the 19th and 20th centuries. A widely known one tells of a ghostly orb in a now-vanished garden maze at the home of C. C. Pegues. The house was located on a lot that occupied a block between Pine and Chestnut streets. The purported haunting was recorded in ‚ÄúSpecter in the Maze at Cahaba‚Äù in 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey.

Oil was first discovered in 1951, and Virden has since come to be known as the \\"Oil Capital of Manitoba\\". History Virden has its roots as a farming community known as Gopher Creek. However, it became a railway tent town in 1882, and grew in population due to the brick and flour industry, as well as with the discovery of oil in the 1950s. The origin of the name, Virden, allegedly arose as a misspelling of the German town Verden in the homeland of the 7th Duke of Manchester's wife. Geography The town is located at the junction of the Trans-Canada Highway (also known as Highway #1) and Highway 83 (the \\"Palms to Pines\\" route) and is surrounded by the Rural Municipality of Wallace-Woodworth.

The chain was renamed to simply M in the mid-1980s. History The company was founded in early 1961 as Miracle Mart Limited by Montreal-based grocery chain Steinberg's. Later in the year, Steinberg's associated itself with Vancouver- based chain Woodward's, and operated the first two stores, in Pont-Viau and Place Greenfield Park, under the trade name of Woodward Steinberg. The partnership between Steinberg's and Woodward ended in 1962, and the two Woodward Steinberg stores were converted to the Miracle Mart name. Miracle Mart operated at mid-level and competed with the likes of Towers/Bonimart, Zellers, Woolco and Kmart. There was also a similarly named grocery chain, Miracle Food Mart (Steinberg's rebranded all their Ontario grocery stores to Miracle Food Marts starting in 1969), that operated exclusively in Ontario. Often found together, some locations with both a grocery and department store became Steinberg Beaucoups or Miracle Beaucoups. In order to provide photographic film-processing services at Miracle Mart stores, a company was created by the Greenberg brothers, named Angreen Photo, which evolved into Astral Photo and became giant Astral Media. M stores logo The chain was facing financial problems since its debut in 1961. In the mid 1980s, Steinberg's underwent a restructuring plan to rebrand the chain to the shorter and less anglophone name of M. The transformation of Miracle Mart locations into M stores were done in different phases. Miracle Mart at Carrefour Laval was the first location to convert as a M store and the only one to do so in the year of 1985. Four additional stores in Greater Montreal were converted to the M name by September 1986; specifically at Promenades Saint-Bruno, Place Longueuil, Mail Champlain and Pont-Viau. Four more stores, again all located in the Montreal area, were added to the M cluster in April 1987: Ch√¢teauguay, West Island Mall, Place Lasalle and Galeries Lachine. The remaining 11 Miracle Mart stores were renamed in August of the same year. Overall, only 20 of Miracle Mart's 31 stores transitioned to the M nameplate. The other 11 locations (7 in Ontario and 4 in Quebec) were closed during the restructuring process. The 11 aforementioned stores that had bit the dust were Place Greenfield Park, Centre Saint-Martin (Laval), Place Lebourgneuf (Charlesbourg), Place Centre Ville (Jonqui√®re) and 7 locations in Southern Ontario. This signaled the end for the chain in south-west Ontario. Other Miracle Mart stores had already been closed in the 1970s and first half of the 1980s due to poor performance. The sub-chain M was initially successful and promising. The first store at Carrefour Laval increased its sales by 55 percent in the first two years that followed its conversion from Miracle Mart to M. In December 1986, the five M stores saw their sales increased by 6,5%, while the remaining 15 Miracle Mart-branded locations continued to decline. Despite a good start, the M chain began to go downhill after the last Miracle Mart stores were renamed in 1987, and was soon experiencing the same financial woes that had plagued its predecessor. When Socanav took over Steinberg's and was trying to sell parts of the company off, a buyer for the poorly performing M stores could not be found. They were liquidated in July 1992, virtually the same time parent company Steinberg's went bankrupt. The original store in Pont-Viau, Laval was still in operation when the company declared bankruptcy.

It was released on April 4, 1995. Century Media Europe released a remastered version of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing on June 12, 2006, which includes the video for \\"S.Y.L.\\", several bonus tracks, and a 12-page booklet containing extended liner notes. Background Strapping Young Lad began in 1994 as a solo project of Canadian musician Devin Townsend. Following his work as vocalist on Steve Vai's 1993 album Sex & Religion and its 1994 tour, Townsend believed he had been a \\"musical whore\\", spending \\"the first five years of [his] career working at the behest of other people\\". During a brief stint as touring guitarist for The Wildhearts, Townsend received a phone call from an A&R; representative for Roadrunner Records, expressing an interest in his demos and an intention to sign him. The offer was ultimately rescinded by the head of Roadrunner, who regarded Townsend's recordings as \\"just noise\\". He faced further rejection by Relativity Records, the label behind Vai's Sex & Religion, who saw no commercial appeal in his music. Century Media Records subsequently contacted the musician, offering him a contract to \\"make us some extreme albums\\". Townsend agreed to a five-album deal with the record label. Following his tour with The Wildhearts, Townsend began recording and producing his debut album, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing, under the moniker Strapping Young Lad. According to Townsend, the recording process took \\"about a week\\". Embracing The Wildhearts' anarchist approach, \\"while focusing on dissonance and just being as over-the-top as [he] could\\", Townsend sang on the record and performed the majority of its instrumental tracks (with the assistance of a drum machine). A few songs, however, featured local session musicians, including guitarist Jed Simon, Townsend's future bandmate. Release and reception Released on April 4, 1995, Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing was not widely recognized in the metal community. The album sold 143 copies in its first six months, but received favourable reviews from the heavy metal press. Its unusual musical ideas‚Äîa synthesis of death, thrash, and industrial metal influences‚Äîprompted Andy Stout from Metal Hammer to call it \\"one of the most disturbing albums you'll hear for a very long time\\". Nevertheless, Townsend has repeatedly expressed his distaste for the recording. He dismissed the album in the liner notes of the record's 2006 reissue, contending that it contained only two great songs. He also deemed its production poor in interviews, referring to the album as \\"basically a collection of demos that were remixed\\". When Century Media advertised the reissue of Heavy as a Really Heavy Thing as the \\"rebirth of a genre-defying classic\\", Townsend called it \\"record company bullshit\\". The album was remastered and re-released on June 12, 2006, by Century Media Europe.

History alt= The seminary was established by Christians in the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, (which later merged with the Reformed Presbyterian Church, General Synod to form Reformed Presbyterian Church-Evangelical Synod), who believed that their denomination, born out of resistance to rising liberal influences, needed a strong theological school of its own. In 1956, Covenant College and Seminary began with eleven students on a plot of land a few miles west of St. Louis, Missouri (having split from Faith Theological SeminaryHarriet A. Harris, Fundamentalism and Evangelicals, Oxford University Press, 2008, , p. 260). The seminary continued to grow in both size and reputation in the years that followed.

In the Age of Sail they were not only determined by the distribution of land masses but also the prevailing winds, whose discovery was crucial for the success of long voyages. Sea lanes are very important for trade by sea. History The westerlies and trade winds The ocean currents The establishment of the North Atlantic sea lanes was inspired by the sinking of the US mail steamer SS Arctic by collision with the French steamer SS Vesta in October 1854 which resulted in the loss of over 300 lives. Lieutenant M. F. Maury of the US Navy first published a section titled \\"Steam Lanes Across the Atlantic\\" in his 1855 Sailing Directions proposing sea lanes along the 42 degree latitude. A number of international conferences and committees were held in 1866, 1872, 1887, 1889, and 1891 all of which left the designation of sea lanes to the principal trans-Atlantic steamship companies at the time; Cunard, White Star, Inman, National Line, and Guion Lines. In 1913‚Äì1914 the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea held in London again reaffirmed that the selection of routes across the Atlantic in both directions is left to the responsibility of the steamship companies.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Fourteenth Edition, Volume 20 pp. 539, 1938 Shipping lanes came to be by analysing the prevailing winds. The trade winds allowed ships to sail towards the west quickly, and the westerlies allowed ships to travel to the east quickly. As such, the sea lanes are mostly chosen to take full advantage of these winds. Currents are also similarly followed as well, which also gives an advantage to the vessel. Some routes, such as that from Cape Town to Rio de Janeiro (passing Tristan da Cunha), were not able to take advantage of these natural factors. Main sea lanes may also attract pirates. Pax Britannica was the period from 1815‚Äì1914 during which the British Royal Navy controlled most of the key maritime trade routes, and also suppressed piracy and the slave trade. During World War I, as German U-boats began hitting American and British shipping, the Allied trade vessels began to move out of the usual sea lanes to be escorted by naval ships. Advantages Behind the cardinal mark is a sea lane opened on an ice-covered sea. Although most ships no longer use sails (having switched them for engines), the wind still creates waves, and this can cause heeling. As such following the overall direction of the trade winds and westerlies is still very useful. However, it is best for any vessel that is not engaged in trading, or is smaller than a certain length, to avoid the lanes. This is not only because the slight chance of a collision with a large ship that can easily cause a smaller ship to sink, but also because large vessels are much less maneuverable than smaller ships, and need much more depth. Smaller ships can thus easily take courses that are nearer to the shore. Unlike with road traffic, there is no exact \\"road\\" a ship must follow, so this can easily be done. Shipping lanes are the busiest parts of the sea, thus being a useful place for stranded boaters whose boats are sinking or people on a liferaft to boat to, and be rescued by a passing ship. Threats from shipping lanes Shipping lanes may pose threats to some ocean-going craft. Small boats risk conflicts with bigger ships if they follow the shipping lanes. Sections of lanes exist which can be shallow or have some kind of obstruction (such as sand banks). This threat is greatest when passing some narrows, such as between islands in the Indian Ocean (e.g. in Indonesia) as well as between islands in the Pacific (e.g. near the Marquesas islands, Tahiti) Some shipping lanes, such as the Straits of Malacca off Indonesia and Malaysia, and the waters off Somalia, are frequented by pirates operating independently or as privateers (for companies and countries). Passing ships run the risk of being attacked and held for ransom. Busiest shipping lanes The world's busiest shipping lane is the Dover Strait. 500-600 vessels per day traverse the narrow strait and in 1999 1.4 billion tonnes gross, carried by 62,500 vessels passed through the strait.

Thanks God. I'm satisfied. It went quickly.\\" The String Quartet in F major, Op. 96, nicknamed the American Quartet, is the 12th string quartet composed by Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. It was written in 1893, during Dvo≈ô√°k's time in the United States. The quartet is one of the most popular in the chamber music repertoire. Composition Dvo≈ô√°k composed the quartet in 1893 during a summer vacation from his position as director (1892‚Äì1895) of the National Conservatory in New York City. He spent his vacation in the town of Spillville, Iowa, which was home to a Czech immigrant community. Dvo≈ô√°k had come to Spillville through Josef Jan Kova≈ô√≠k who had finished violin studies at the Prague Conservatory and was about to return to Spillville, his home in the United States, when Dvo≈ô√°k offered him a position as secretary, which Josef Jan accepted, so he came to live with the Dvo≈ô√°k family in New York.Clapham 1979, Norton, pp. 112‚Äì113 He told Dvo≈ô√°k about Spillville, where his father Jan Josef was a schoolmaster, which led to Dvo≈ô√°k deciding to spend the summer of 1893 there.Clapham 1979, Norton, pp. 119‚Äì120 In that environment, and surrounded by beautiful nature, Dvo≈ô√°k felt very much at ease.Milan Slavicky. \\"String quartet in F major Op. 96 'American',\\" sleeve notes to Dvo≈ô√°k: String Quartets (complete), Stamitz Quartet. Brilliant Classics No. 99949, 2002. Writing to a friend he described his state of mind, away from hectic New York: \\"I have been on vacation since 3 June here in the Czech village of Spillville and I won‚Äôt be returning to New York until the latter half of September. The children arrived safely from Europe and we‚Äôre all happy together. We like it very much here and, thank God, I am working hard and I‚Äôm healthy and in good spirits.\\"Letter to Jindrich Geisler, quoted in at He composed the quartet shortly after the New World Symphony, before that work had been performed.≈†ourek. p. 20 Dvo≈ô√°k sketched the quartet in three days and completed it in thirteen more days, finishing the score with the comment \\"Thank God! I am content. It was fast.\\" It was his second attempt to write a quartet in F major: his first effort, 12 years earlier, produced only one movement.≈†ourek. p. 89 The American Quartet proved a turning point in Dvo≈ô√°k's chamber music output: for decades he had toiled unsuccessfully to find a balance between his overflowing melodic invention and a clear structure. In the American Quartet it finally came together. Dvo≈ô√°k defended the apparent simplicity of the piece: \\"When I wrote this quartet in the Czech community of Spillville in 1893, I wanted to write something for once that was very melodious and straightforward, and dear Papa Haydn kept appearing before my eyes, and that is why it all turned out so simply. And it‚Äôs good that it did.\\"Quoted in at For his symphony Dvo≈ô√°k gave the subtitle himself: \\"From the New World\\". To the quartet he gave no subtitle himself, but there is the comment \\"The second composition written in America.\\"Burghauser, Jarmil. Antonin Dvo≈ô√°k: Thematic Catalogue, with a bibliography and a Survey of Life and Work, B√£renreiter Supraphon, Prague, 1996, p. 302 =Negro, American or other influences= For the London premiere of his New World symphony, Dvo≈ô√°k wrote: \\"As to my opinion I think that the influence of this country (it means the folk songs as are Negro, Indian, Irish etc.) is to be seen, and that this and all other works (written in America) differ very much from my other works as well as in couleur as in character,...\\"Excerpts from Dvorak‚Äôs correspondence: to the secretary of London‚Äôs Philharmonic Society, Francesco Berger (Vysoka, 12. 6. 1894), quoted in at Program notes written by Dvo≈ô√°k for the first London performance of the New World symphony, quoted in Neil Butterworth, Dvo≈ô√°k: his life and times (1980, Midas Books, ), p. 103 Dvo≈ô√°k's appreciation of African-American music is documented: Harry T. Burleigh, a baritone and later a composer, who knew Dvo≈ô√°k while a student at the National Conservatory, said, \\"I sang our Negro songs for him very often, and before he wrote his own themes, he filled himself with the spirit of the old Spirituals.\\"Jean E. Snyder, \`A great and noble school of music: Dvo≈ô√°k, Harry T. Burleigh, and the African American Spiritual.' In Tibbetts, John C., Ed., Dvo≈ô√°k in America: 1892‚Äì1895, Amadeus Press, Portland, Oregon 1993, p. 131 Dvo≈ô√°k said: \\"In the Negro melodies of America I discover all that is needed for a great and noble school of music.\\"Interviewed by James Creelman, New York Herald, May 21, 1893 For its presumed association with African-American music, the quartet was referred to with nicknames such as Negro and Nigger, before being called the American Quartet.John Clapham. \\"Bedrich Smetana and Antonin Dvorak\\" in Chamber Music, edited by Alec Robertson. Penguin Books, 1963.Michael Kennedy and Joyce Bourne (eds.) \\"‚ÄòAmerican‚Äô Quartet\\" in The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music. Oxford University Press, 1996. (2004 reprint) The older nicknames, without negative connotations for the composition, were abandoned after the 1950s.Hughes, 1967, p. 165, wrote that the quartet is \\"commonly known as the 'Nigger' quartet (although since that word has become taboo in the country of its origin the nickname has fallen somewhat into disuse)\\"Liane Curtis (ed.) A Rebecca Clarke Reader, pp. 102, 104. The Rebecca Clarke Society, 2004. Norman Edwards. Questions of Music. 2005, p 39. Dvo≈ô√°k wrote (in a letter he sent from America shortly after composing the quartet): \\"As for my new Symphony, the F major String Quartet and the Quintet (composed here in Spillville) ‚Äì I should never have written these works 'just so' if I hadn't seen America.\\"Letter to Emil Kozanek, September 15, 1893, translated in Letters of Composers, Gertrude Norman and Miriam Lubell Shrifte, editors (1946, Alfred A Knopf, Inc.) Listeners have tried to identify specific American motifs in the quartet. Some have claimed that the theme of the second movement is based on a Negro spiritual, or perhaps on a Kickapoo Indian tune, which Dvo≈ô√°k heard during his sojourn at Spillville.Butterworth, p. 107 A characteristic, unifying element throughout the quartet is the use of the pentatonic scale. This scale gives the whole quartet its open, simple character, a character that is frequently identified with American folk music. However, the pentatonic scale is common in many ethnic musics worldwide, and Dvo≈ô√°k had composed pentatonic music, being familiar with such Slavonic folk music examples, before coming to America.John H. Baron. Intimate Music: A History of the Idea of Chamber Music, p. 363. Pendragon Press, 1998. On the whole, specific American influences are doubted: \\"In fact the only American thing about the work is that it was written there,\\" writes Paul Griffiths.Paul Griffiths, The String Quartet, A History(1983, Thames and Hudson ) \\"The specific American qualities of the so- called \\"American\\" Quartet are not easily identifiable, writes Lucy Miller, \\"...Better to look upon the subtitle as simply one assigned because of its composition during Dvo≈ô√°k's American tour.\\"Lucy Miller, Adams to Zemlinsky (2006, Concert Artists Guild, ), p. 123. Dvo≈ô√°k's transcription of the song of a bird that he believed to be a scarlet tanager (top) and the appearance of the song in the third movement of the quartet. The identification of this bird as a scarlet tanager is questionable. Some have heard suggestions of a locomotive in the last movement, recalling Dvo≈ô√°k's love of railroads.Butterworth, p. 89 Dvo≈ô√°k quoted in the third movement, measures 21-24, a bird that he believed was a scarlet tanager, an American songbird. The song appears as a high, interrupting strain in the first violin part.Miller, p. 124 Dvo≈ô√°k was annoyed by this bird's insistent chattering, and transcribed its song in his notebook. American ornithologist Ted Floyd showed in 2016 that the bird quoted by Dvo≈ô√°k likely was not a scarlet tanager; instead, the bird was probably a red-eyed vireo, another American songbird.  Structure  The quartet is scored for the usual complement of two violins, viola, and cello, and comprises four movements:This analysis is based on analyses in Griffiths, Miller, and \\"Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k\\" in Walter Willson Cobbett, Cobbett's Cyclopedic Survey of Chamber Music(1923, Oxford University Press) A typical performance lasts 26 to 30 minutes. =I. Allegro ma non troppo= First theme of the first movement, played by the Seraphina Quartet. The opening theme of the quartet is purely pentatonic, played by the viola, with a rippling F major chord in the accompanying instruments. This same F major chord continues without harmonic change throughout the first 12 measures of the piece. The movement then goes into a bridge, developing harmonically, but still with the open, triadic sense of openness and simplicity. Second theme of the first movement. The second theme, in A major, is also primarily pentatonic, but ornamented with melismatic elements reminiscent of Gypsy or Czech music. The movement moves to a development section that is much denser harmonically and much more dramatic in tempo and color. Fugato at end of development The development ends with a fugato section that leads into the recapitulation. Cello bridge in recapitulation After the first theme is restated in the recapitulation, there is a cello solo that bridges to the second theme. =II. Lento= Theme of the second movement The theme of the second movement is the one that interpreters have most tried to associate with a Negro spiritual or with an American Indian tune. The simple melody, with the pulsing accompaniment in second violin and viola, does indeed recall spirituals or Indian ritual music. It is written using the same pentatonic scale as the first movement, but in the minor (D minor) rather than the major. The theme is introduced in the first violin, and repeated in the cello. Dvo≈ô√°k develops this thematic material in an extended middle section, then repeats the theme in the cello with an even thinner accompaniment that is alternately bowed and pizzicato. =III. Molto vivace= First section of the Scherzo movement. Listen for the song of a forest songbird high in the first violin. Dvo≈ô√°k believed the bird to be a scarlet tanager, but it seems more likely that it was a red-eyed vireo. The third movement is a variant of the traditional scherzo. It has the form ABABA: the A section is a sprightly, somewhat quirky tune, full of off-beats and cross-rhythms. High in the first violin there appears the song of a bird the composer believed to be a scarlet tanager; however, the song was likely not that of the tanager. Second section of the scherzo The B section is actually a variation of the main scherzo theme, played in minor, at half tempo, and more lyrical. In its first appearance it is a legato line, while in the second appearance the lyrical theme is played in triplets, giving it a more pulsing character. =IV. Finale: vivace ma non troppo= Main theme of the last movement The final movement is in a traditional rondo form, ABACABA. Again, the main melody is pentatonic. \\"B\\" section of the rondo The B section is more lyrical, but continues in the spirit of the first theme. \\"C\\" section of the rondo The C section is a chorale theme. Performance and influence In a first \\"private\\" performance of the quartet, in Spillville, June 1893, Dvo≈ô√°k himself played first violin, Jan Josef Kova≈ô√≠k second violin, daughter Cecilie Kova≈ô√≠kov√° viola, and son Josef Jan Kova≈ô√≠k the cello. The first two public performances of the quartet were by the Kneisel quartet, in Boston on 1 January 1894,Hughes, p. 172Butterworth, p. 110 and then In New York on 13 January. An unnamed reviewer wrote the next day that to be sure, \\"there is none of the soaring or the yearning of the mighty Beethoven\\", but that there is \\"the spirit of eternal sunshine\\" which is \\"the soul of Mozart's music\\".The New York Times 14 January 1894, p. 11. Burghauser mentions press notices in both cities, the first in the New York Herald, 18 December 1893. While the influence of American folk song is not explicit in the quartet, the impact of Dvo≈ô√°k's quartet on later American compositions is clear. Following Dvo≈ô√°k, a number of American composers turned their hands to the string quartet genre, including John Knowles Paine, Horatio Parker, George Whitefield Chadwick, and Arthur Foote. \\"The extensive use of folk-songs in 20th century American music and the 'wide-open-spaces' atmosphere of 'Western' film scores may have at least some of their origins\\" in Dvo≈ô√°k's new American style, writes Butterworth.Butterworth, p. 95  Notes  Sources  * *Dvo≈ô√°k, Anton√≠n: Quartetto XII.

ReceptionBox Office= According to Kinematograph Weekly it was the sixth most popular film of 1941 in Britain, after 49th Parallel, Great Dictator, Pimpernel Smith and Lady Hamilton. =Critical reception= In a contemporary review, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times, \\"To call it a manifest triumph would be arrant stinginess with words. For this is something more than just a brilliant and adult translation of a stimulating play, something more than a captivating compound of ironic humor and pity. This is a lasting memorial to the devotion of artists working under fire, a permanent proof for posterity that it takes more than bombs to squelch the English wit. It is as wry and impudent a satire of conventional morals and social creeds as though it had been made in a time of easy and carefree peace. It is, in short, a more triumphant picture than any the British have yet sent across.\\" while more recently, Time Out wrote, \\"There is plenty to relish, notably Newton and Morley hamming it up (as, respectively, the rumbustious Bill Walker and the overbearing tycoon), and Deborah Kerr in her debut; but it does tend to just sit there. It was David Lean's first shot at directing, but producer Pascal helmed the bulk of it.\\" DVD Major Barbara was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection on 23 February 2010, as part of the box set George Bernard Shaw on Film.

It was published in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop in three volumes from January 11, 2005 to December 11, 2007. Peach Fuzz originally started as a short 17-page story in Tokyopop's 2nd Rising Stars of Manga competition, where it won the grand prize. The series also appeared in a Sunday comic strip form within Sunday newspaper comics sections. Peach Fuzz focuses on the relationship between a young girl and a ferret who believes herself to be a princess. Plot The series begins when Amanda desires a unique pet and chooses a young ferret at the local pet shop. Her mother reluctantly yields to her decision on the condition that it should never injure her. Amanda names it Peach after seeing a fruit stand with peaches. Terrified of losing her new pet and companion, Amanda keeps Peach's biting a secret. Peach, in turn, rebels in a self-congratulatory way, maintaining that she is a ferret princess who must heroically retain her composure and courage while being tormented by five-headed giants and their slaves. After being forced to fight Mr. Fuzzy ‚Äî a toy given to Peach which she views as a servant, Peach bites Amanda and Amanda, in response, tries the \\"Bitter Bite\\" spray to discipline her. Amanda's actions reminds her of her mother and Peach softens her view of Amanda. Amanda brings Peach to her class's show and tell and because of Peach's popularity with the class, Amanda's friend Kim decides to get a ferret. Her ferret, Pavaratty, displays arrogance towards Peach and doubts her princess status since she lacks a palace, an entourage and treasure. Peach resolves to gain these things so she can impress the ferret prince. Meanwhile, two bullies turn Amanda's class against her after she wears a handmade ferret costume to school in an attempt to stand out. To collect more treasure, Peach secretly accompanies Amanda to school. Kim realizes Amanda's friendship is more important and admits she was wrong to turn against her. Peach accidentally saves the class's hamsters from being eaten by a snake which escaped during the show and tell. Amanda is redeemed in the class's eyes. To ease Peach's boredom, Amanda gets another ferret, who is named Edwin after the hero of a romance novel. Initially Peach believes he is her ferret prince, but quickly becomes annoyed by him. Amanda brings the ferrets to her friend's house. There, Peach and Edwin meet Mimi's albino ferrets, the manic-depressive Spore and melancholy Truffle, who believe that they and anyone who enters their land is cursed. After Edwin breaks off a claw, Peach softens her view of him, but becomes ill. She recovers and decides that even if Edwin is not a prince, she still loves him. Development As a young girl, Lindsay Cibos frequently read comic books such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Gargoyles. After learning about manga, she preferred it to comics because it had art and female-centered storylines that appealed to her. She found it easier to get into manga because they were self-contained stories that started at the beginning. She learned about Tokyopop's Rising Stars of Manga contest from a Tokyopop Newsblast e-mail but was unable to work on an entry for the contest because of other projects. For the second contest, she worked with Jared Hodges, whom she had met at an anime club in 1998, and set aside a month to work on her entry; she wanted to \\"make a good concise little story for the contest's 20-page limit.\\" Based on a web-comic that the two had been working on, their entry \\"Peach Fuzz\\" won the grand prize, was published in Tokyopop's anthology and turned into a manga series of the same name. While drawing the series, Cibos and Hodges encountered the challenge of working with the screentone and \\"digitally inking\\" the comic. Some of Peach Fuzz is based on real-life ferrets and places. The creators designed the ferret characters Peach and Edwin after Cibos's pet ferrets Momoko‚ÄîJapanese for Peach‚Äîand Elf. They also modeled several of Edwin's mannerisms on Elf's. Elf's \\"single-minded obsession to a pair of headphones\\" became the model for \\"Pavaratty‚Äôs devotion to his toy microphone\\". In contrast, the human characters have no specific model. Cibos stated: \\"Bits and pieces were likely inspired from the people around me and from an amalgam of life experiences Jared and I had growing up: remembering what it was like to be in the fourth grade, having a pet for the first time, dealing with bullies, misunderstandings with parents, and so on.\\" Several of the locations in Peach Fuzz, such as Mimi's apartments, were designed after real-life places. Release Written and illustrated by Lindsay Cibos and Jared Hodges, Peach Fuzz was published in three volumes in North America and the United Kingdom by Tokyopop from January 11, 2005 to December 11, 2007. The first six chapters of Peach Fuzz also appeared as a serial in forty newspapers, including The Chicago Tribune, Los Angeles Times, and Vancouver Sun, from January to July 2006. In Australia and New Zealand, Madman Entertainment distributes the series. It is also licensed in Sweden by B. Wahlstr√∂ms Bokf√∂rlag, in Germany by Tokyopop Germany, in Finland by Pauna Media Group, in Spain, and in Portugal by Edi√ß√µes Asa. =Volume list=Reception Peach Fuzz received positive reviews from English-language critics. Newtype USA's Jennifer M. Contino enjoyed how much of the story focused on Peach's perspective and called the series \\"a promising debut\\". Danica Davidson of The Book Report praised the appeal of the \\"fun cast of characters\\" and described the series as \\"cute and warmhearted...with plenty of laughs.\\" Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, noted the potential of the series but thought it could have \\"benefited from experienced editing\\" and commented on the mixed messages being sent, stating: \\"If we root for the character we see most often, Peach, then we‚Äôre hoping to see her continue to misbehave. If we root for Amanda teaching Peach how to behave, then most of the material is irrelevant or mistargeted.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Peach Fuzz at Tokyopop's website *Peach Fuzz at Lindsay and Jared's official website * Category:Humor comics Category:Tokyopop titles Category:Original English-language manga ","title":"Peach Fuzz"},{"id":"2018444","text":"Heathcote railway station is located on the Illawarra line, serving the Sydney suburb of Heathcote.

At the , Pambula had a population of 970 people. History The area was populated by the Thaua Aboriginal people, with shell middens dating back 3000 years. The name Pambula is derived from its Dharwa name, pronounced \\"panboola\\", meaning 'twin waters'. In 1797, the European voyager George Bass explored the area. Pambula is a historic village with its first European settlers thought to have been the Imlay brothers who established cattle runs on the Pambula River flats in the 1830s. The village of Pambula situated on the flats near the river was planned in 1843 by surveyor Townsend and the first school and churches were built there, but frequent flooding led to the village being relocated to its present site on higher ground. Captain John Lloyd, RN, acquired land in 1844 with his severance pay when he left the Royal Navy, and built The Grange on the hill near the river. At about that time he invited the family of Syms Covington to move there. Covington had joined the second survey expedition of HMS Beagle as a fiddler and cabin boy. He became an assistant and manservant to Charles Darwin during the voyage and for a few years afterwards before emigrating to Australia. In 1854 he became Postmaster of Pambula, and managed an inn called the Forest Oak Inn which still stands at a bend on the coast road. The main land uses were grazing and agriculture, and tented accommodation on stock routes was replaced by slab and bark huts, then by more permanent buildings providing homes, housing, smithies, and hotels. Pambula had five licensed hotels by 1856 and the foundation stone for the courthouse was laid in 1860. Pambula was proclaimed a town in 1885. In 1888, gold was discovered and villages grew up around the mines at nearby Yowaka River and Pipeclay Creek. This created a boom in the town, but in the early 20th century production of gold ceased and the prosperity of the town went into a decline. William McKell, Premier of New South Wales from 1941-1947 and Governor-General of Australia from 1947-1953, was born in Pambula in 1891. Pambula continued to be the dominant town of the district, providing facilities which came to include commercial premises, banks, courthouse, hospital, newspaper, and a school of arts. Agriculture developed on the river flats, producing prize crops of maize and potatoes, and a dairying industry became established. Timber felling was carried out in the surrounding forests, and oyster farming was developed in the river.  Heritage listings  Pambula has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Princes Highway: Oaklands  Facilities  Pambula is situated approximately south of Merimbula and has its own hospital, a small supermarket, a community bank, and a primary school. The nearest secondary school is a private secondary school in nearby Pambula Beach. The nearest public secondary schools are in Bega and Eden.  Attractions  Panboola, the Pambula wetlands heritage project, is located between the south edge of town and the Pambula River. Panboola contains fresh water billabongs, saline areas around the former racecourse, saltmarsh and mangroves, plantings of thousands of trees, shrubs and ground covers, walking and cycle tracks and tables and seats. Sport Pambula has a local cricket team, the Pambula Bluedogs. Their home ground is located at the Pambula Recreation oval in the town's centre. The Pambula Sporting Complex is the home ground for the Pambula Panthers Australian Football Club. This club was formed in 1983. The ground is also the home ground for the newly created soccer club, Pambula United Football Club, also known as The Penguins. Located in between Pambula and Merimbula is the 27 hole course Merimbula Golf Club.

It was established in 1963 and is responsible for overseeing the University of New Hampshire - Durham, the University of New Hampshire School of Law, the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, Plymouth State University, Keene State College, and Granite State College. The University System of New Hampshire is the largest provider of post-secondary education in New Hampshire and is governed by a single board of trustees which is responsible for ensuring that each institution has a unique character and educational mission. Presently USNH has approximately 32,000 enrolled students annually and more than 90,000 alumni living in state. History The decision to establish the university system came from the recommendation of the Interim Commission on Higher Education appointed in 1961 by Governor Wesley Powell. In establishing the university system, the Keene and Plymouth Teachers' Colleges were removed from the supervision of the State Board of Education, were renamed \\"state colleges\\", and placed under the jurisdiction of the Board of Trustees of the University of New Hampshire. The number of trustees increased from 13 to 22 with the establishment of the University System. The Board designated the President of the University of New Hampshire as \\"first among equals\\" and assigned the responsibility to coordinate the activities of the three institutions. In 1972, the trustees established the School of Continuing Studies (now Granite State College) to serve the adult education needs of New Hampshire residents. From 1963 to 1974, there was a growing concern of the trustees over the steadily increasing amount of time that senior UNH officials had to devote to the growing responsibilities to the university system. An appointed committee representing a broad spectrum of political, professional, and educational interests later named the Carter Commission recommended the employment of a System Director of Personnel and the development of a comprehensive personnel system which would provide for the establishment of a statewide educational system. The trustees voted to physically separate the university system staff from the university staff. In summer 1974, the newly designated USNH staff moved five miles west of Durham to Lee. The trustees also had legislation passed and signed to create the position of chancellor. The chancellor was established as the chief executive and chief academic officer of the system to oversee the head of each institution, and is elected and answerable to the trustees. Board of trustees The University System of New Hampshire is governed by a 29-member Board of Trustees comprising the Governor of the state, the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, ten members appointed by the Governor and Executive Council, seven alumni-elected members, two student-elected members, the Commissioner of Education, the Commissioner of Agriculture, the presidents of the University System's four colleges and universities, and the Chancellor.

Basic backstitch Backstitch or back stitch and its variants stem stitch, outline stitch and split stitch are a class of embroidery and sewing stitches in which individual stitches are made backward to the general direction of sewing. In embroidery, these stitches form lines and are most often used to outline shapes and to add fine detail to an embroidered picture. It is also used to embroider lettering. In hand sewing, it is a utility stitch which strongly and permanently attaches two pieces of fabric. The small stitches done back-and- forth makes the back stitch the strongest stitch among the basic stitches. Hence it can be used to sew strong seams by hand, without a sewing machine. Applications A versatile stitch which is easy to work, backstitch is ideal for following both simple and intricate outlines and as a foundation row for more complex embroidery stitches such as herringbone ladder filling stitch. Although superficially similar to the Holbein stitch, which is commonly used in blackwork embroidery, backstitch differs in the way it is worked, requiring only a single journey to complete a line of stitching. Basic backstitch is the stitch used to outline shapes in modern cross-stitch, in Assisi embroidery and occasionally in blackwork. Stem stitch is an ancient technique; surviving mantles embroidered with stem stitch by the Paracas people of Peru are dated to the first century BCE.Enthoven, Jacqueline: The Creative Stitches of Embroidery, Van Norstrand Rheinhold, 1964, , p. 65 Stem stitch is used in the Bayeux Tapestry, an embroidered cloth probably dating to the later 1070s, for lettering and to outline areas filled with couching or laid-work.Levey, S. M. and D. King, The Victoria and Albert Museum's Textile Collection Vol. 3: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750, Victoria and Albert Museum, 1993, Split stitch in silk is characteristic of Opus Anglicanum, an embroidery style of Medieval England. Description of the technique Stitch diagram for working Back stitch Backstitch is most easily worked on an even-weave fabric, where the threads can be counted to ensure regularity, and is generally executed from right to left. The stitches are worked in a 'two steps forward, one step back' fashion, along the line to be filled, as shown in the diagram. Neatly worked in a straight line this stitch resembles chain stitching produced by a sewing machine. The back stitch can also be used as a hand sewing utility stitch to attach two pieces of fabric together. Variants Variants of backstitch include: *Basic backstitch or point de sable. *Threaded backstitch *Pekinese stitch, a looped interlaced backstitch *Stem stitch, in which each stitch overlaps the previous stitch to one side, forming a twisted line of stitching, with the thread passing below the needle.

Origin  The Primera Junta, created on May 25 1810 out of the May Revolution, was meant to be a provisional government until a Junta representative of all the cities of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata was integrated. Reactions from the provinces, however, were not homogeneous. Some of them recognised the Buenos Aires Junta and the outcome of the events of the May Revolution, while others sought to exercise exclusive control over their own affairs, and still others continued to recognize the Regency Council in Spain. Thus, in order to avoid royalists taking political advantage of the situation, the Buenos Aires Junta sought to quickly assert its power. On May 27 1810, it delivered messages to every one of the Viceroyalty municipal councils (), asking them to elect representatives to join the Junta at Buenos Aires. By early December, most delegates had already arrived in the capital city, and they were asking for their effective incorporation into the governing body (that was being held up due to the infighting between centralists led by the Junta's Secretary of War Mariano Moreno, and federalists led by the Junta's President, Cornelio Saavedra). Ultimately, Saavedra managed to orchestrate Moreno's resignation and on December 18 1810, the Junta Grande was at last established. It governed until September 23 1811 (since August 26 1811 under the presidency of Domingo Matheu), when it was replaced as the executive authority by the First Triumvirate. However, reorganized as a Conservative Junta, it retained some controlling functions over the Triumvirate.

Dragon's breath consists primarily of magnesium pellets/shards.

Dragon's breath is normally chambered in 12-gauge ‚Ä≥ () shot shells. The rounds are safe to fire out of an improved cylinder bore as well as a modified choke barrel, common on many shotguns. Overview While its combat or tactical usage remains undocumented, the visual effect it produces is impressive and entertaining, similar to that of a short-ranged flamethrower or fireworks. Also undocumented, it has been claimed by enthusiasts that the rounds are often used as a distress signal, similar to a very short duration emergency flare gun, though some would argue a flare would be better suited for such. It may also be used as a less-than-lethal option for self-/home-defense, although the less-than-lethal aspect and safety are disputed, as the magnesium shards burn at approximately , which is more than enough to light a person, or house, on fire. Compared to most regular types of shotgun ammunition that is mass-produced, the pyrotechnic shell is somewhat expensive, and costs US$5‚Äì7 per shell, depending on caliber and load. Due to the shells being low-pressure charged rounds, it is not suited to be used in a semi-automatic shotgun as it does not produce enough recoil energy to cycle the automated action, causing the mechanism to fail to cycle.

The name was later given to a reimagined comic book series for DC's Vertigo imprint. The first Losers comic was a war comics feature set during World War II. It was created by Robert Kanigher and became a regular feature in DC's long-running war comic book series Our Fighting Forces beginning with issue #123, dated January/February 1970. The Losers Prior to the formation of the group, each character had his own adventures in DC's war anthology comics. Captain Johnny Cloud, a Navajo pilot who always destroyed his planes after a mission, had appeared in All-American Men of War #82‚Äì115 (1960‚Äì1966); the two- man team of Gunner and Sarge had first appeared in issue #67 of the same title (March 1959) before transferring to Our Fighting Forces for a fifty-issue run, #45‚Äì94 (May 1959‚ÄìAugust 1965). Captain Storm, a PT boat commander, had his own title, which lasted 18 issues from 1964 to 1967.Captain Storm at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 9, 2012. Their first appearance as a group was with The Haunted Tank crew in G.I. Combat #138 (October‚ÄìNovember 1969) in a story titled \\"The Losers\\". The tank crew had failed to destroy a Nazi radar station and collected the 'Losers'. The men were on their own after surviving separate disastrous battles. The eight-man strong group rallied and returned to the site of the Nazi radar station, demolishing it. Prior to that, Captain Storm, Gunner and Sarge (along with Fighting Devil Dog) had teamed together once before to fight some Japanese naval officers in Captain Storm #13. They got their own series a few months later (January/February 1970), as the main feature of Our Fighting Forces, beginning with issue #123. Their stories as a team were written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by a variety of artists, most notably Sam Glanzman, Russ Heath, John Severin, and Joe Kubert. The group served in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific, meeting other DC World War II characters such as the Haunted Tank and Sergeant Rock. The team briefly had a female member named Ona Tomsen who was part of the Norwegian resistance movement, who joined the team in issue #135. At the same time, the team briefly lost Captain Storm, who suffered amnesia (and lost an eye) due to a bomb blast. They reunited in issue #141, when Capt. Storm reappeared as a one-eyed, peg-legged pirate. Gunner's pet dog Pooch also joined the team for some missions. =Series authors= Robert Kanigher was the original writer for the series, and he emphasized the group's bad luck. They were anti-heroes, and the stories emphasized negative aspects of war. During the Vietnam War, Kanigher added this philosophy to many of the DC war books. Also in common with most DC war books of the time were spectacular cover illustrations by Joe Kubert. Ken Barr did the art chores for the first issue, with Ross Andru and Mike Esposito participating beginning with issue #124. John Severin, a veteran of Marvel Comics' Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos began doing the art chores by issue #132.

In The Losers Special #1, written by Kanigher and illustrated by Glanzman, the Losers (along with Pooch) died in action during 1945 while destroying a German missile site: Sarge was bayoneted, Captain Storm fell on a grenade, and the remainder were strafed by aircraft bullets. The Special was published during 1985, during the Crisis' initial printing, and remained the definitive ending of the group for several years.The Losers Special #1 (1985) In 2000, a short- lived revival of the Creature Commandos resurrected Gunner as a cyborg warrior member of the new team.\\"Creature Commandos\\" #1-8 (May‚ÄìDecember 2000) Gunner and Sarge are found alive and out of their own time in an issue of Birds of Prey, trapped in a POW camp in the time-fluctuating Dinosaur Island, now with a \\"Pooch\\" that is a trained Velociraptor. It is not known if they somehow went back in time to conclude their lives or if this brings them into the present. In the backup story \\"Snapshot: Remembrance\\" in the retrospective mini-series DC Universe: Legacies #4, set during a reunion on July 4, 1976, it is revealed that the Losers did survive the end of the war. Storm works for the Bureau of Disabled Veterans Affairs, Gunner is a veterinarian in memory of the now-dead Pooch, Sarge owns a string of service stations along the East Coast and Johnny Cloud is a third-term congressman. The other attendees are Jeb Stuart of the Haunted Tank, Gravedigger, Mademoiselle Marie and possibly the Unknown Soldier.DC Universe: Legacies #4 (October 2010) An alternative ending was presented in the out-of-continuity 2004 miniseries DC: The New Frontier. In it, the group was sent to Dinosaur Island during December 1945 to rescue Rick Flag and important war-time information. Once they go on the island, one by one, they are killed due to the dangers of the island. Gunner is smashed by a Tyrannosaurus rex. Storm is snatched by flying beasts. Sarge vanishes while trying to kill the same Rex. Pooch is hit by a booby trap set by Rick Flag. Johnny Cloud, after ensuring Flag can conclude the mission, sacrifices himself in a revenge mission on the same T-Rex. Their epitaph, of sorts, was written by Johnny Cloud: \\"Ask my family and they'll tell you I was a Navajo. Ask the Army Air Force and they'll say I was an American. But if you ask my brothers, they'll set you straight. John Cloud was a Loser.\\"\\"DC: The New Frontier\\" #1 (2004) The Losers (Vertigo series) A new The Losers series began during 2004, created by writer Andy Diggle and artist Jock and published under DC's Vertigo imprint. The new series, set in the present, concerns a team of special forces soldiers who declare war on the Central Intelligence Agency after their Agency handler tries to assassinate them. It was initially inspired by and intended to be a continuation of the original series, with the unit having survived their final mission and getting back together in the 1950s for a caper story.introduction to The Losers: Volumes One & Two anthology, 2010 Our Fighting Forces #1 (2010 One-Shot) In 2010 DC published five one-shots featuring characters and titles revived from their \\"classic\\" war comics line, including Our Fighting Forces, featuring The Losers. The one-shot was written by B. Clay Moore and drawn by Chad Hardin and Wayne Faucher. The story featured the \\"classic\\" team of Johnny Cloud, Captain Storm and Gunner & Sarge.

For relatives of Donald and Scrooge, see Duck family (Disney) or Clan McDuck. For characters exclusive to the DuckTales franchise, see List of DuckTales characters. Main characters * Donald Duck * Daisy Duck * Huey, Dewey, and Louie * Scrooge McDuck * Ludwig Von Drake Relatives * Duck family (Disney) * Clan McDuck Duck characters Ducks are the most common type of named characters in the Donald Duck universe. Like Donald, they appear as white American Pekin ducks. This section contains a list of characters with the surname \\"Duck\\" who are not related to Donald. Disney illustrator Don Rosa has said that \\"Duck\\" is a common name in Duckburg (just as \\"Smith\\" or \\"Jones\\" are common in the real-life United States) and does not necessarily identify a blood relation of Donald. =Donna Duck= Donna Duck is the first love interest of Donald Duck. She was later replaced by Daisy Duck. According to some sources, Daisy was introduced in 1937 as Donna Duck, yet there is conflicting evidence as to whether Donna was an early version of Daisy or a separate character entirely. However, the fact that The Walt Disney Company released a collector's pin (See #703 on Pinpics.com) in 1999 which states, \\"Daisy Duck debuts as Donna Duck 1937,\\" solidifies the fact that Daisy Duck and Donna Duck were, in fact, one and the same. Donna made her sole animated appearance in the short film Don Donald (1937), directed by Ben Sharpsteen. It was the first installment of the Donald Duck film series and was also the first time Donald was shown with a love interest. In the story, Donald travels to Mexico to court a duck who is largely a female version of himself. She is portrayed with the same feisty temperament and impatience and was even voiced by Donald's voice actor Clarence Nash. At the end of the story she spitefully abandons Donald in the desert after his car breaks down. Some sources consider Don Donald, Daisy's debut. These include The Encyclopedia of Animated Disney Shorts, and the Big Cartoon DataBase. In addition to this, Don Donald is included on the Disney-produced DVD \\"Best Pals: Donald and Daisy.\\" Donna's identification as an early Daisy is aided by the fact that other Disney characters, such as Goofy, were also introduced under different names (Dippy Dawg), appearances, and mannerisms. \\"Donna\\" in Italian is also the equivalent of \\"Don,\\" a title Donald takes in the film's title. However, in 1951 the character of Donna was retconned in a newspaper comic strip where she appeared as a separate character from Daisy, and as an unwitting rival for Donald's affections. =Daisy Duck= Daisy Duck is Donald's girlfriend. Huey, Dewey, and Louie sometimes call her \\"Aunt Daisy\\", but it is unclear if this signifies an affinal or fictive relationship. =Gladstone Gander= Gladstone Gander is Donald's lucky cousin who is always flirting with Daisy Duck. Gladstone first appeared in \\"Wintertime Wager\\" in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #88 (Jan 1948), written and drawn by Carl Barks. =April, May, and June= April, May, and June (their surname is unknown) are the triplet nieces of Daisy Duck. They were created by Carl Barks and were first used in the story \\"Flip Decision\\", published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #149 (Feb 1953). According to their debut story, they live in Duckburg with their parents, though they do not appear in the comic. Their mother is a sister of Daisy. When they appear at family gatherings their parents are never present and they usually accompany Daisy. In some stories, mostly Dutch, they live along with their aunt, but in other comics, such as the comics by Barks, they are only visiting Daisy. The triplets act as Donald's nephews' (Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck) female counterparts, occasional rivals, occasional friends, and occasional dates. They are members of the organization The Junior Chickadees, who serve as The Junior Woodchucks' female counterparts. Unusually for children of their age, the girls routinely wear high-heeled shoes. Like the nephews, April, May & June usually wear the colors red, blue and green, but unlike them, a color assignment has never been established. The girls also frequently wear yellow, purple and orange. However, one might consider \\"blue\\" to be April's color since that was the color she wore when she appeared solo in \\"Dell Giant\\" #35. It is also unknown which nephew is paired with which niece when they double date with their Uncle Donald and Aunt Daisy. In 1998, the editors of the Dutch Donald Duck weekly magazine decided the three girls should be modernized, and they got permission from the Disney Company to do so. Dutch Duck comic artist Mau Heymans designed a new hairdo and new wardrobe for April, May and June. They now do not look the same at all in Dutch stories and do not have the 'girly' occupations anymore they had when Barks created them. In some Danish stories, the new hairdo has been copied. April, May, and June were not seen in animation until they were given a special cameo appearance in the House of Mouse episode \\"Ladies' Night\\".Ladies' Night . The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts . Retrieved on March 22, 2008. They would later appear as regular cast members in the 2018 animated series Legend of the Three Caballeros (all three voiced by Jessica DiCicco). April, May, and June never appeared on DuckTales and have not been indicated to appear in the reboot series, but Webby Vanderquack from both versions strongly resembles them. This led to Dutch translators naming Webby 'Lizzy', which is used for April in Dutch. May and June are called Juultje and Babetje in The Netherlands.Webby Vanderquack. Dutch Wikipedia. Retrieved on March 22, 2008. April, May, and June returned to American comics in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #698. The story had them retelling \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" with the girls as Red and the Beagle Boys as the wolf. =Goldie O'Gilt= Goldie O'Gilt, a.k.a. Glittering Goldie, is Scrooge's secret sweetheart. Originally created by Carl Barks as a character in the story Back to the Klondike (Uncle Scrooge #2, March 1953), Goldie's origins are as a music hall singer in Dawson City. In a flashback sequence, Scrooge catches Goldie in an attempt to rob him of his recent gold poke, and she is forced to repay the debt by helping him work at his claim at White Agony Creek. Some 50 years later, they meet again and it is revealed that Goldie is now poor and living alone at Scrooge's former claim in Yukon. Barks only used the character once, but Goldie and her relationship with Scrooge was later picked up and expanded by other creators. One of these was Don Rosa who used her in several stories, including The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck and Last Sled to Dawson, where it is implied that Scrooge and Goldie fell in love with each other, but never revealed their feelings of affection to the other one, and eventually drifted apart as Scrooge traveled across the world and became a trillionaire, while Goldie remained in Dawson. Carl Barks drew inspiration for Glittering Goldie's character from Kathleen Rockwell (\\"Klondike Kate\\" Rockwell). Goldie is the owner of a wild bear called Blackjack trained by her to attack \\"prowlers\\", word used by Goldie herself in \\"Back to the Klondike\\". Goldie is eventually used in Italian or Danish comic stories, but some of those ones show situations that may conflict with others previously showed in \\"Back to the Klondike\\". Some examples are her comic appearances in \\"Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√®\\" by Romano Scarpa, where she appears as a resident in a nursing home and as a grandmother of Dickie Duck, a girl who has recently completed her secondary education, and in a Danish story called \\"The Old Lady\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Old Lady where Donald ignores who is Scrooge's former love of Klondike when his uncle asks him to pick Goldie up at the train station, since she is coming for a visit. But Donald and his nephews knew Goldie personally in \\"Back to the Klondike\\". Curiously, Goldie appears taller than Scrooge in another Danish story, \\"After The Ball\\".Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story After The Ball Goldie appears in the original DuckTales animated series, where her appearance is largely based on her comics origins. She has also been reimagined for the DuckTales reboot as a female kleptomaniac adventurer with whom Scrooge often clashes despite their mutual affection. =Flintheart Glomgold= Flintheart Glomgold is Scrooge's archenemy and the second richest duck in the world. The character was created by Carl Barks in the 1956 story \\"The Second-Richest Duck\\". =Brigitta MacBridge= Brigitta MacBridge, is a supporting character created in Italy by Romano Scarpa, first appearing in \\"The Last Balaboo\\" (Topolino #243, July 1960). While she first appeared in 1960, her relationship with Scrooge McDuck is said to have started in 1930. The relationship did not start well. Scrooge, who at the time had already been isolated from his family, when hearing of her feelings about him reacted quite cynically. He bought her an expensive fur coat and in exchange asked her to never bother him again. This did not work. Brigitta truly loves Scrooge, and for decades she has tried every method to get him to return her love. This includes stalking him, which greatly infuriates Scrooge. To impress him she has established her own business and at times acts as his rival. She has proven to be cunning and skilful and seems to have a very strong will. Sometimes she has Jubal Pomp helping her. Dickie Duck (Goldie's Granddaughter) occasionally appears as her employee. Right from the beginning, Scarpa and his successors have left enough hints that Scrooge is interested in her, but does not enjoy her obsession with him. Although he pretends to be emotionless ‚Äî a typical character trait ‚Äî he is not. When she gets in trouble, he is there to help her, and he has at times protected her from danger. Whenever another man expresses an interest in her, Scrooge seems not to be above jealousy. In the story \\"The Next Best Thing\\" by writer Lars Jensen and artist Jos√© Maria Manrique,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Next Best Thing Scrooge manipulates his rival Flintheart Glomgold into dating her, so he can feel free at last, but then he discovers Flintheart is heartlessly using her and rescues her. Though Scrooge has had chances to end their strange relationship, when she is truly frustrated with his behavior, he has instead chosen to pass them by and even apologizes to her at times. On another note, Brigitta acts as Scrooge's personal nurse whenever he is sick and has nursed him back to health on many occasions. She is among Scrooge's most trusted allies and she volunteers to help whenever he asks for it. Scrooge's relatives are quite friendly with Brigitta and seem to have accepted her as an unofficial member of the family; she is even present in family meetings. Brigitta has also helped them against the Beagle Boys and Magica De Spell at times. John D. Rockerduck is said to find his rival's relationship amusing and is himself friendly with Brigitta, including John already pretended to be in love with her to make Scrooge jealous. And it really worked for Brigitta, but then Scrooge discovered her pact with John, who was interested in keeping Scrooge busy in a possible marriage with Brigitta. These events were shown in the story \\"Zio Paperone e l'amore a seconda vista\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge and Love at Second Sight\\").Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone e l'amore a seconda vista In the story Brother From Another Earth! (1995), written by Rudy Salvagnini and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano, a parallel-universe Scrooge is bankrupt and married to Brigitta, whose shopaholic ways are contributing to his money problems. When the parallel-universe Scrooge fools the Earth A Scrooge into trading places, the Earth A Scrooge works to set things right by retiring his debts and seeking money-making opportunities. He also put Brigitta on a strict budget and says she should do her own cooking, as she was once a restaurateur. After Scrooge solves the money problems of his parallel- universe counterpart, he returns to his own world but realizes he may be missing out on marriage, so he starts a relationship with the Brigitta from his world. Despite the fact that Brigitta MacBridge and Glittering Goldie love the same man, Scrooge McDuck, these two quite different ladies have never been in conflict because of his affection in the rare comic stories where they both appear. But in the story \\"Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√®\\" (free translation: \\"The Arrival of Dickie Duck\\")Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√® by Romano Scarpa, Brigitta feels really sad when she sees Scrooge and Glittering together for a brief moment, but then Glittering comforts her and says that she assumes Brigitta loves Scrooge's stingness more than himself and Brigitta thanks for Glittering's \\"kind\\" words and calls her \\"my friend\\". There are only other six Italian stories ‚Äî \\"Zio Paperone Pigmalione\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge Benefactor\\") by writer Caterina Mognato and artist Sandro Dossi,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone Pigmalione \\"Zio Paperone e Le Grandi Conquiste\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge and The Big Achievement\\") by writer Gianfranco Cordara and artist Andrea Ferraris,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone e Le Grandi Conquiste \\"Paperina di Rivondosa\\" (\\"Daisy of Rivondosa\\") by Silvia Ziche,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Paperina di Rivondosa \\"San Valentino a Paperopoli ‚Äî Doretta vs Brigitta?\\" (\\"Valentine's Day in Duckburg ‚Äî Goldie vs Brigitta?\\") by writer Giorgio Fontana and artist Marco Mazzarello,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"San Valentino a Paperopoli ‚Äî Doretta vs Brigitta?\\" \\"Zio Paperone e il nuovo canto di Natale\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge and the new Christmas Carol\\") by writer Marco Bosco and artist Silvia ZicheCoa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"Zio Paperone e il nuovo canto di Natale\\" and \\"Piccole grandi papere\\" (\\"Small big ducks\\") by writer Marco Bosco and artist Silvia ZicheCoa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"Piccole grandi papere\\" ‚Äî where they both appear, but they are not shown talking to each other in the first three stories, including they do not even meet face to face in any panel of the stories \\"Zio Paperone Pigmalione\\" and \\"Zio Paperone e Le Grandi Conquiste\\". In German and Dutch, she is named Gitta (sometimes Brigitta) Gans (Gans = Goose). In newer Dutch comics her name is changed to Brigitta MacBridge. =John D. Rockerduck= John D. Rockerduck is a wealthy oil magnate, and one of Scrooge McDuck's main business rivals. Rockerduck was created by Carl Barks, who used him in one story: \\"Boat Buster\\", first published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #255 (Dec 1961). =Magica De Spell= Magica De Spell is an evil sorceress who is always trying to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime in order to make an amulet that will give her the Midas Touch. The character was created by Carl Barks in the December 1961 story \\"The Midas Touch\\". =Miss Quackfaster= Emily or Florence Quackfaster is the secretary of Scrooge McDuck. She was originally hired by Scrooge's sisters Hortense McDuck and Matilda McDuck. At first Scrooge did not like the idea of having someone on his payroll but he got used to her very quickly. In fact, some stories have revealed that Scrooge has come to depend on Miss Quackfaster. Even though Scrooge is a shrewd businessman and can easily smell profit, running basic organizational jobs in his own office is beyond his capability. Miss Quackfaster first appeared in Uncle Scrooge #36 (Dec 1961) in the story The Midas Touch (the same story that introduced Magica De Spell), and her last name Quackfaster was first used in Uncle Scrooge #39 (Sept 1962) in A Spicy Tale. Both stories were created by Carl Barks. Miss Quackfaster is almost always referred to by her surname. In one story by Don Rosa, The Empire-Builder from Calisota (1994), her first name was said to be Emily. However, in Geoffrey Blum's Uncle Scrooge comic World Wide Witch (2001, published in the US in Uncle Scrooge #320), her first name is given as Florence instead (her full name is seen on the door to her office). Later stories by other authors have occasionally used the name Emily again. She was also known as Miss Typefast in some stories and on the 1987 show DuckTales she was called Mrs. Featherby. In the 2017 DuckTales series she is once again known by the name of Emily Quackfaster and is the somewhat unhinged keeper of Scrooge's private archives. =Fethry Duck= Fethry Duck is the son of Lulubelle Loon and Eider Duck (a son of Grandma Duck) and is the beatnik cousin of Donald Duck. He was created for the Disney Studio Program by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard and was first used in the story \\"The Health Nut\\", published on August 2, 1964. Fethry has a rather unorthodox way of viewing and reacting to the world around him, as does his backwoods brother, Abner \\"Whitewater\\" Duck (from WDC&S; #267). In 1982, the Brazilian Disney market created a young nephew for Fethry named Dugan Duck who tends to be quite a handful. Like Goofy (Super Goof) and Donald (Superduck), since the early 1970s Fethry has occasionally donned superhero garb and called himself the Red Bat (not related to the villain of the same name whom Mickey Mouse faced in his heroic guise as \\"Plastic Mickey\\"). Occasionally Gloria, Fethry's girlfriend (created by Gerson Luiz Borlotti Texeira), would team-up with the Red Bat as another costumed crime-fighter called the Purple Butterfly (Borboleta Purpurea). Even Fethry's nephew, Dugan, has donned a costume and called himself Red Bat Junior. Fethry often appears in Uncle Scrooge and Donald Duck tales. In his earliest adventures he supposedly lived in another state (possibly New York or California, and had to visit via airplane or train. However, since 1964 he has resided in an old house definitely in Duckburg. He is also closely associated with the hillbilly Hard Haid Moe who dislikes Fethry very much (though Fethry does not seem to understand this), and with Donald's pet cat, Tabby. =Hustler Duck= Hustler Duck is an obscure character created by Dick Kinney & Al Hubbard that works as a marketing man. He first appeared in \\"The Good Earth\\", first published in Almanacco Topolino #94 (Oct 1964). The American cartoonists who most frequently used this character were Jim Fletcher and Vivie Risto, although Hubbard is credited for co-creating him. Hustler is funnily annoying and he wears big round glasses, like John Rockerduck. He is always ready to sell his services in different professional areas to Uncle Scrooge McDuck in most of his oldest stories. After almost ten years withoug being used in comic stories, Hustler appeared in two Brazilian ones firstly published in 1975. His last appearance was in a Brazilian story from 1991.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Index to Hustler Duck stories In the comic story \\"A Star is Born\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story A Star Is Born Hustler calls an aunt of him,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Excerpt of the comic story A Star is Born as published in the Australian comic book Giant (G Series) 368 (1966) but the name of this aunt is not revealed. =Katie Mallard= Katie \\"Hashknife Kate\\" Mallard is an old friend of Scrooge who first appeared in \\"Mystery of the Ghost Town Railroad\\" by Carl Barks (Uncle Scrooge #56, March 1965). Katie is portrayed as a kind and brave woman. She uses some humor in the story too. For example, when everybody around her is tense because of mysterious thefts, she offers pancakes with a smile on her face saying that at least her pancakes cannot be stolen. According to the story, Scrooge and Katie meet each other in the city of Goldopolis after sixty two years. Katie's granddaughter, the cowgirl Ducky Bird, appears in the beginning of this one, meeting Donald, his nephews and Scrooge by chance. Scrooge is desperate when he meets Ducky, since he thinks it will be impossible to find a certificate for one thousand shares in the Goldopolis and Boom City Railroad that he had intentionally hidden in the now desolate city of Goldopolis to avoid that they were stolen by the McViper Clan. He had previously discovered that those shares suddenly became highly valuable. Then he at last discovers that Ducky is the granddaughter of his old friend \\"Hashnife Kate\\", who tells him about how dangerous is to stay in the city lately. On their next appearance in the story, Katie and Ducky think Scrooge and his nephews are in trouble with robbers, after they heard some shooting coming from the old hotel where Scrooge decided to spend the night. Soon Katie and Ducky discover that Donald and the triplets are dealing with ghosts inside the hotel. Katie Mallard also has a cameo appearance in the second-to-last episode of \\"The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck\\" by Don Rosa, where she is younger. =Gotrocks= Gotrocks is a not very well-known rival of Scrooge McDuck. He was used for the first time in the May 1966 story \\"The Luck of Pali\\" by Bob Gregory and Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Luck of Pali where he and Scrooge both take a part in a museum contest to know who has the most unusual valuable object. Gotrocks is an unpleasant old man with black and thick eyebrows, whose eyes are quite often narrowed, as suggesting that he owns a foxy personality. He has long and white hair on the right and left sides of his head and is always holding a crutch. Gotrocks was also used by the prolific Brazilian comic writer Ivan Saidenberg in four comic stories.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Index to Brazilian stories with Gotrocks Another very different character also called Gotrocks appears in \\"The Goat With the Long Silky Hair\\" as a rival of Scrooge too.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Goat With the Long Silky Hair =Granny De Spell= Granny De Spell, whose real name may be Caraldina De Spell, is the greatest witch in the world. She is the grandmother of Magica De Spell, and taught Magica sorcery when she was a child. By the 1960s, however, she had retired to a lonely and cobwebby old castle, where she spent most of her time sitting in a rocking chair, knitting. But her mind (and curses) are still sharp as flints, and she casts a usually-disapproving eye at her granddaughter's frequent attempts to get Scrooge McDuck's Dime, though she can also be persuaded to help her descendant once in a while. She and Magica love each other dearly, but Granny tends to get on Magica's nerves in her attempt to fix her up with clumsy magician Rosolio, for whom Magica really could not care less. The character was created by George Davie and Jim Fletcher, and her first appearance was in the May 1966 comic story \\"A Lesson from Granny\\". Starting with the 1995 story \\"Magica De Spell and the Great Rock of Power- Plus\\", Giorgio Cavazzano introduced a redesigned, more active Granny De Spell, now sporting long blond hair, who has made several subsequent appearances. Granny De Spell's first name has not been used in English publication. However, her Italian name gives it as Caraldina, which considering the fact that the character is, in-universe, Italian, is a perfectly plausible suggestion. Further strengthening it is the fact that she bears similar first names in the German (Karoline) and French (Caroline) versions. Granny De Spell's precise age is also unknown, but she states in her debut that she was already the queen of sorcery before Madam Mim was even born, making her at least over 1500 years old. =Dickie Duck= Dickie Duck () was created by Romano Scarpa. She first appeared in \\"Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√®\\" (\\"The Miner's Granddaughter\\", published in Topolino #577 (Dec 1966). She was introduced as Goldie O'Gilt's granddaughter. In the story \\"Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park\\" by Romano ScarpaCoa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Paperetta e la leggenda del luna park she calls Huey, Dewey, and Louie cuginetti (small/young cousins) (in the third panel of the first page) and then cugini (cousins) (in the fourth panel of the second page), showing she's developed a close relationship with the McDuck/Duck family. Dickie does not have an official family name in Italy, being \\"Y√®-Y√®\\" a reference to Y√©-y√©, a style of pop music of the early 1960s, which she uses with her original name, \\"Paperetta\\", as if to show her love for pop music. She has become popular in Italy, Denmark, Brazil and some other countries, while she is almost unknown in the USA and others. Dickie clearly seems to be older than Huey, Dewey, and Louie. According to Scarpa, she completed her secondary education at a boarding school (Goldie says to Scrooge in the original Italian, \\"Ehm, come sai, ho una nipotina che √® cresciuta in collegio! Ora ne esce...\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Excerpt of the Italian story Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√® which can be loosely translated as \\"Er, you know, I have a granddaughter who has grown in a boarding school! Now she's leaving...\\"), so she is possibly around 18 years old. In recent comics, she's often depicted as attending a university. Goldie and Dickie's connection as grandmother and granddaughter is loose, but has been referenced in multiple stories since then. The first one was in the Italian story \\"Arriva Paperetta Y√®-Y√®\\" (published in the US as \\"The Miner's Granddaughter\\" in IDW's Uncle Scrooge #18), which introduced Dickie in this particular universe. In this story, Goldie drops Dickie off because she cannot take care of her anymore, so she asks Scrooge McDuck to do it for her. Dickie usually lives in her own house or a college dorm with a roommate. Sometimes Dickie has worked as a reporter for Brigitta McBridge or for Scrooge's little known brother Gideon McDuck. In Brazil, her name is Pata Lee, (a reference to the singer Rita Lee) she appeared in her own series with her teen friends the short owl Netunia, the tall crane Olimpia, the handsome pelican Parceiro, and Foliao, which is actually the name given to the old cartoon character Aracuan Bird, in a series of stories titled Os Adolescentes (translated loosely from Portuguese to The Teenagers) as a bonus story in Ze Carioca (a comic book starring Jos√© Carioca). Netunia, Olimpia and Parceiro were specially created to be part of Dickie's gang by Brazilian Disney Studios, which belongs to Grupo Abril. That was the first (and probably only) time that a teen gang was introduced in the \\"Duckverse\\" (a nickname commonly used to refer to the Disney Ducks Universe). Dickie and her four close friends possibly are studying journalism at some university of Duckburg, because of her clear connection to the reporter career, which was shown in various comic stories. Donald and his nephews never appeared in those stories with Dickie's teen gang. Dickie Duck's first American appearance was in the Gemstone run of Donald Duck Adventures, in the story \\"Return to TNT\\", in a cameo.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Return to TNT Just like Moby Duck, Dickie is one of the few secondary characters who was cast as a small figurine in two different Italian collections by De Agostini. =0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier= 0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier are a secret-agent duo. They were created by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard for the Disney Studio Program, a unit that produced Disney comics for foreign publication. Their first story was \\"The Case of the Purloined Pearls\\" published in 1966. 0.0. Duck's name is a play on \\"007\\" (a.k.a. \\"James Bond\\") while Mata Harrier's one is an obvious play on \\"Mata Hari\\". They appeared for the first time in the story \\"The Case of the Purloined Pearls\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Case of the Purloined Pearls where they fought against agents of the evil organization \\"BLONK\\". Then the agents of this organization became the traditional rivals of 0.0. Duck and Mata Harrier in their subsequent stories, most of them created by Brazilian cartoonists. 0.0. Duck owns a small dog ironically called Wolf. The latest comic appearance of 0.0. Duck, Mata Harrier, Wolf and agents of BLONK was in the 20th adventure of the comic subseries Tamers of Nonhuman Threats, called \\"Things that Go Blonk\\".Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Things that Go Blonk Even 0.0. & Mata's subchief, created by Brazilian comic artists in 1975, appears in this one. =Belle Duck= Belle Duck is a plus-sized, tall and elegant duck lady. She appeared for the first time in \\"Belle Corners the Coin Collection\\" with drawings by the cartoonist Al Hubbard, first published in Topolino #591 (March 1967). In this story, Scrooge meets Belle again 40 years after their last meeting. He tells to his grandnephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie before her arrival at his house that she was the most charming girl of her town, being daughter of a tycoon who lived in a mansion. But later Belle reveals that now a riverboat called The Gilded Lily is everything that she can own, since she spent all her inheritance money. Scrooge cannot hide his surprise at seeing his old crush's look after all those years when they finally meet each other in the story. Tony Strobl was the American cartoonist who most frequently drew this character, despite Hubbard was the cartoonist who first drew her. Belle is an independent, self-assured, generous and warm-hearted woman, and Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck adore her. She also has a joyful personality and she loves to give parties on her riverboat by using Scrooge's money. Borrowing money from Scrooge is generally the first thing that Belle thinks of when she intends to repair The Gilded Lily or to buy a new piece of machinery for it. She often shows a daring behavior towards Scrooge, like in \\"The Return of Belle Duck\\" by Strobl,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Return of Belle Duck where Scrooge asks her about what they will talk about and she answers, \\"About your money... and how I'm going to spend it!\\".Coa Inducks ‚Äî Excerpt of the story The Return Of Belle Duck, as published in the French comic book Picsou Magazine 95 In \\"Go West, Young Duck\\" by Dick Kinney and Tony Strobl,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Go West, Young Duck Belle tells the story of a European ancestor of her called Christina Duck who tried to find America in 1492.

He first appeared in \\"Rescue of the Grand Mogul\\" by Vic Lockman and Tony Strobl (Huey Dewie and Louie Junior Woodchucks #2, Aug 1967). In various comic stories, Mogul was shown with a big belly instead of a big chest. He is often portrayed as a self-confident, demanding and rigid leader, but not rarely he has clumsy attitudes. The name Grand Mogul is actually rarely mentioned in the Junior Woodchucks comic stories, since their leader's official name traditionally changes from one story to another (e.g. Great J.A.W.B.O.N.E., Great C.O.O.L.H.E.A.D., Great I.R.O.N.H.E.A.R.T., Great T.O.P. B.R.A.S.S. ‚Äî these abbreviations are always spelled out in a text box when they are first mentioned, but their expansions are usually quite contrived), but it was stipulated as the generic one when someone wants to refer in English language to the leader of this group of scouting boys created by Carl Barks. His real name never was revealed. Before the story \\"Whale of a Good Deed\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Whale of a Good Deed firstly published in Huey, Dewey, and Louie/Junior Woodchucks #7, the Junior Woodchucks' leader was generally shown as some Carl Barks's dognose (a human face with dog snout). But even in later stories with the Junior Woodchucks a character with dognose look eventually appears as their leader. The comic story \\"Rescue of the Grand Mogul\\"Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Rescue of the Grand Mogul possibly was the first one where the name Grand Mogul was used to refer to the leader of the Junior Woodchucks, but it was written by Vic Lockman, not by Barks, and its title refers to the rescue of a dognose leader. Since 1992 the cartoonist Daan Jippes, a fan and follower of Carl Barks, has used Grand Mogul in many old comic stories written by Barks. He has redrawn those ones.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Daan Jippes's comic stories with Grand Mogul A new Grand Mogul was introduced in Italy in the 1990s, whose nickname is Mogul Bertie. His real name is said to be Bertie McGoose. He is a goose guy with blonde hair, being quite more easy-going than the original Mogul. And his chest is not as big as Mogul's one. He has a crush on the leader of the Italian version of the Chickadees, Clarissa (original Italian name), a human-like girl. Mogul Bertie became a major character in the Italian comic book series Giovani Marmotte (Italian name for the Junior Woodchucks).Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page to the covers of Giovani Marmotte But other characters also became popular among Italian comic readers with this comic book series, especially Alvin, a scared chicken kid, and Lardello (original Italian name), a gluttonous pig kid. Alvin is actually a revamped version of an old character from foreign market stories, who has only one story published in America, \\"The Spirit of Chief Firebird\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Spirit of Chief Firebird where he is called Willie. =Roberta= Roberta is an anthropomorphic female duck who appeared for the first time in \\"Uncle Scrooge and the Witches in Action\\" (\\"Zio Paperone e le streghe in azione\\") from Topolino #812 (June 1971), written by Rodolfo Cimino and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano. She is a witch friend of Magica De Spell and has been used in various Italian stories, becoming a relatively popular character.Duckipedia.de ‚Äî Page to the Disney character Mona Menetekel (originally called Roberta) In her first comic appearance, Roberta is described as a technological witch, but she does not hesitate to use ancient wizardry knowledges to help Magica to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime. Despite being a duck, Roberta owns a very different beak comparing to the usual ones in this particular universe. Her beak is longer and pointier. Roberta originally has a big blonde frizzy hair and blue eyes. After having three comic book appearances during the 1970s, Roberta started being used again during the 1990s in comic stories mostly written by her co-creator Rodolfo Cimino. Her last comic book appearance thus far was in a story from 2008, where she appears with her original look.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"Zio Paperone e il congelamento dei crediti\\" =Reginella= Reginella is an anthropomorphic female duck created in Italian Disney comics by writer Rodolfo Cimino and artist Giorgio Cavazzano, first appearing in \\"The Kingdom Under the Sea\\" (\\"Paperino e l'avventura sottomarina\\"), from Topolino #873 (Aug 1972). She is a queen who governs an undersea kingdom inhabited by duck-like aliens forced to live in our planet after losing their spaceship in a disaster. She became one of Donald Duck's greatest loves. In her first comic appearance, she knows Donald after he is captured by one of her subjects while he was practicing the underwater fishing to fulfill her own order, since she is irresistibly attracted by his look and intends to make him her king. However, she is advised by her counselor to let him go, after Donald commits an act of cowardice.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"Paperino e l'avventura sottomarina\\" Donald's romance with Reginella ended up becoming a trilogy, whose first two \\"chapters\\" were respectively published in 1972 and 1974. The last one was published only in 1987. After the end of this trilogy, Reginella appeared in two comic stories published during the 1990s. She also had a cameo appearance in a commemorative story to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Italian comic book series Topolino.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story \\"60 anni insieme con Topolino\\" She also appears in a long comic story by Silvia Ziche. =Gloria= Gloria is the girlfriend of Fethry Duck, created by Brazilian comic artists in the early 1970s, when Fethry was starting to get very popular in Brazil. In her first story, \\"Paz, Amor E Gl√≥ria\\" (Z√© Carioca #1099, Dec 1972), she was a hippie girl. But her look and behavior were radically revamped in later stories and her hippie side was quite softened. She still looks like a hippie, but she acts more like an eccentric and a bit neurotic urban girl. For example, she appears using a vintage hair dryer, wearing high heels or practicing jogging in some stories.Inducks ‚Äî Brazilian story Ser Hero√≠na Cansa A Minha BelezaInducks ‚Äî Brazilian story Por Baixo Do PanoInducks ‚Äî Brazilian story Picha√ß√µes Along with her boyfriend Fethry, Gloria was used in various Brazilian parodies of famous stories,Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Sir Peninho√©Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Os Ca√ßadores Da Pena Perdida especially during the 1980s.

His first appearance was in \\"Paperino e il piccolo Krack\\" (\\"Donald Duck and the Little Krack\\"), published in Almanacco Topolino #228 (Dec 1975). He is a lookalike and probably ancestor to Donald Duck. Andold was a commander who protected the shores of Caledonia (Scotland) from Vikings. He has a girlfriend named Aydis who looks like Daisy Duck, and he also has five soldiers, two of them are named Little Bo and Big Brutus. Andold wears a helmet, topped with a miniature decoration representing his own face. As a comical touch, the decoration's facial expression always matches Andold's own, changing between panels if necessary. In the first Andold story (Paperino e il piccolo Krack from 1975), Donald dreams about Andold, in the second (Le avventure di Mac Paperin: L'arrosto della salvezza from 1980, published in the United States as Donald Duck and his fierce ancestor... Andold Wild Duck), Huey, Dewey, and Louie are reading a book about his adventures. In later Andold stories, the modern-day Ducks do not appear. All Andold Wild Duck stories are illustrated by Marco Rota, most of them are also written by him. The names Andold and Aydis are anagrams of Donald and Daisy. =O.K. Quack= O.K. Quack is an alien duck who appears in some Italian comics created by Carlo Chendi and drawn by Giorgio Cavazzano. His first appearance was in \\"Topolino\\" #1353 (Nov 1981) in the story \\"Paperino e il turista spaziale\\" (published in the US as \\"The Tourist at the End of the Universe\\" in IDW's Uncle Scrooge #30). He is an alien who came from space, and more precisely from the planet Duck, with his spaceship shaped as a coin and that can be shrunk to the size of a dime and reads O.K. Quack's fingerprints as a means of activating its size mechanism. He also appeared in some other stories such as \\"Zio Paperone e il satellite bomba\\" (published in the US as \\"Scare of the Sky Satellite!\\" in IDW's Uncle Scrooge #33) from \\"Topolino\\" #1354, \\"E quando Paperino prende una decisione...\\" (\\"And when Donald takes a decision...\\") from \\"Topolino\\" #1373; \\"Zio Paperone e la moneta disco volante\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge and the flying saucer coin\\"); \\"Zio Paperone e la piramide capovolta\\" (\\"Uncle Scrooge and the upside- down pyramid\\"). In all of these stories O.K. Quack is looking for his spaceship that has been lost and is circulating as a dime somewhere in Duckburg. O.K. Quack soon reveals his strange abilities such as being able to communicate mentally with seemingly inanimate objects (usually convincing locks to \\"unlock themselves\\", but he particularly likes talking to flowers) and telekinesis (moving things with the power of his mind, even buildings as big as Scrooge's money bin). He does not understand the concept or use of money (in this way he seems to have been inspired by Bill Walsh and Floyd Gottfredson's Eega Beewa). Franco Fossati once defined him as \\"...a perfect character who with his innocence criticizes the absurdity of our society. Going on with time he will adequate to our times and to our every-day way of living and we'll forget that he came from space.\\" Uncle Scrooge, Donald Duck and the Nephews know that O.K. Quack is a space alien and are actively trying to help him find his ship. They first met him in the money bin where he entered talking to Scrooge's locks and was looking at Scrooge's coins thinking that they were all spaceships. Thus he does not require any cover story and can freely act in his strange ways (at least in front of them). He sometimes lives in the Money Bin, and sometimes in a rented room in a small hotel in Duckburg where he met Humphrey Gokart, a sorry private detective whose services O.K. has contracted to also help locate his spaceship. As for his initials \\"O.K.\\" there has been no real explanation and it is assumed that they basically mean the same as the American expression meaning \\"alright!\\" Other friendly aliens like O.K. Quack have appeared in Italian stories and have also become friends of members of the Duck Family, such as Little Gum,Page in English language for the character \\"Little Gum\\" who is able to make different shapes with chewing gums, and Etci,Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page for the Italian Disney character \\"Etci\\" who came from a planet where everybody likes to invent facts and developed allergy to lies. His name is the Italian onomatopoeia for a sneeze. =Humphrey Gokart= Humphrey Gokart (original Italian name: Umperio Bogarto) is a private detective. He was created by Italian cartoonists Carlo Chendi and Giorgio Cavazzano in 1982 to be used as a supporting character in two stories with O.K. Quack. Ironically, Gokart became more popular than O.K. He is named after the actor Humphrey Bogart. Gokart's office is straight from a typical 1920s-era American detective novel. He is running severely late on payment of his rent. Gokart wears a trench coat, a fedora and gum-soled shoes. As a detective, Gokart is rather clumsy and incompetent. Despite this, Scrooge McDuck often relies on his services, because he is by far the cheapest detective in Duckburg. Gokart started his career as a hotel detective, with the job of looking for clients who left without paying. After moving on to bigger cases, Gokart has started cooperating with Fethry Duck. =Pandy Pap= Pandy Pap is an Italian Disney character who appeared in three comic stories drawn by the cartoonist Giorgio Cavazzano during the 1990s; her first story was \\"Zio Paperone e la fabbrica d'aria\\" (Topolino #1783, Jan 1990). She is a radical ecologist who became friends with Huey, Dewey, and Louie and the Junior Woodchucks. Pandy has straight blonde hair and wears hot pink short overalls.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Index to stories with Pandy Pap =Howard Rockerduck= Howard Rockerduck, invented by Don Rosa, is an American businessman and the father of Scrooge's rival John D. Rockerduck. He first appeared in \\"The King of the Copper Hill\\", published in Anders And & Co. #1993-02 (Jan 1993). Howard Rockerduck, implied to be much older than Scrooge, was already a millionaire by the time Scrooge was earning his fortune. Unlike his son, who is not above resorting to cheating and even criminal behavior to compete with Scrooge, Howard Rockerduck is an honest and honorable businessman. Howard Rockerduck has made only two major appearances in the comics. His first appearance was when Scrooge was earning his fortune in the American Old West. Howard, who was traveling with his wife and infant son John on a stagecoach to Butte, Montana, spotted Scrooge digging for gold beside the road. Impressed with Scrooge's efforts, Howard stayed to help Scrooge out while his wife and son continued to Butte without him. Howard Rockerduck later appeared in Scrooge's old hometown Glasgow in Scotland, when Magica De Spell used time travel to steal Scrooge's Number One Dime while he was still a small boy. In this timeline, Howard was only a background character and did not even meet Scrooge. He was traveling on a holiday in Europe, flaunting his riches and trying to flirt with the local ladies, who were not very receptive to this behavior. After an encounter with Magica, who Howard first thought was a normal Scottish lady, but who later even caused Howard's stagecoach to crash in her mad pursuit of Scrooge's famous dime, Howard decided he had had enough of the temper of the Scottish ladies and bought a ticket on a ship back to the United States. =Princess Oona= Princess Oona is a character created by Stefan Printz-P√•hlson and his wife Unn Printz-P√•hlson in the story \\"Princess Oona\\" (Anders And & Co. #1995-47, Nov 1995). During a trip to the Stone Age in Gyro Gearloose's time machine Gyro and Donald Duck first meet the incredibly strong cave-duck Oona. On the journey back to the future she stows away in the time machine, and has remained in Duckburg ever since. All of the early Princess Oona stories‚Äîand a significant percentage of modern ones‚Äîwere illustrated by the Chilean artist Victor Arriagades Rios, better known by his artist name Vicar. After having written the first couple of stories about Princess Oona, Stefan Printz-P√•hlson asked the rest of the Egmont crew to do stories with the super cave girl. So far about 25 have been created, teaming Princess Oona with such well-known Disney characters as Scrooge McDuck, Daisy Duck, Gladstone Gander, the Beagle Boys and Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Oona claims to be attracted to Donald and she is always trying to get his attention, but in the story \\"Love and War\\" by Lars Jensen and Vicar she falls for Gladstone.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Love and War The adventures of Princess Oona have appeared in Disney publications in many countries including Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Brazil, Iceland and Russia. She has not appeared in any animation, though she is similar to the DuckTales character Bubba the Caveduck. =Evronians= The Evronians are a race of extraterrestrial ducks who appear in PKNA comics, first created in 1996. They are antagonists of Donald's superhero alter ego the \\"Duck Avenger\\" (). Individual Evronian characters are listed in the main article. =Bum Bum Ghigno= Bum Bum Ghigno is a character created by Corrado Mastantuono in 1997. Bum Bum Ghigno is a rotund man who dresses in overalls and a red chequered shirt. He also has protruding front teeth, similar to Goofy, and thick black eyebrows. Bum Bum Ghigno is a general layabout with no permanent profession. He is frequently seen in various short-timed jobs, but his laziness and clumsiness prevent him from holding them for long. In his first appearance he was an antagonist to Donald Duck and Gyro Gearloose, but has since become their friend. =Velma Vanderduck= Velma Vanderduck is a rich Dutch woman who competes with Scrooge. Her first appearance was in \\"Two-Bit Tycoons\\", in Anders And & Co. #1999-38 (Sept 1999). She is a redhead with green eyes. Velma has a personal secretary, Jackson Jackdaw, an anthropomorphic jackdaw. Thus far, Velma has already appeared in six stories written by Lars Jensen. The last one was published in 2016.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Index to stories with Velma Vanderduck =Fantomallard= Fantomallard (Italian: Fantomius), occasionally translated as Phantom Duck, was a notorious masked gentleman thief during the 1920s. Fantomallard was the alter ego of Lord John Lamont Quackett, an aristocratic playboy who liked to play jibes at other aristocrats. By donning a special suit and a bright blue mask covering his entire face, Lord Quackett turned into Fantomallard, a gentleman thief who robbed richer aristocrats of money or other valuables he thought they had got by unjust means, and then dealt out his loot to help the poor. Decades later, Donald Duck accidentally discovered Lord Quackett's secret hideout and decided to become the Duck Avenger (Italian: Paperinik). In the first stories, the Duck Avenger was a vindicator who continued his predecessor's work, but later stories turned him to more of a superhero character, fighting crime for altruistic instead of egoistic reasons. Some stories take place in Fantomallard's time in the 1920s, featuring the original Fantomallard instead of the modern Duck Avenger. These stories are easily identifiable by using less saturated colours, evoking the feel of classic 1920s-era films. =Dolly Paprika= Dolly Paprika was Fantomallard's female partner-in-crime during the 1920s. Dolly Paprika was the alter ego of Dolly Duck (Italian: Dolly Papera), Lord Quackett's girlfriend. When masked, Dolly Paprika wore a red outfit masking her entire body. She supported her boyfriend on his nearly every adventure and often took advantage of her seemingly harmless appearance to fool her adversaries. Other bird charactersClara Cluck= Clara Cluck debuted in the 1934 Mickey Mouse cartoon Orphan's Benefit. She is an operatic chicken who is a good friend of Mickey Mouse. It is possible that Clara Cluck played the title role in The Wise Little Hen (June 9, 1934), as both characters were voiced by the same person, Florence Gill, and there is more than just a passing physical resemblance. However, by the time she made her big debut in the original version of Orphan's Benefit, she had changed into an oversized operatic diva; a role that she would continue in until the end. Clara's singing is meant to be a caricature of the Bel Canto style of Opera singing popular at the time of her appearance. Some of her arias are clearly modeled on those of Tosca. Her last major appearance was as one of the musicians in Symphony Hour. Curiously, although she is seen in the rehearsal scenes at the beginning, she is not seen in the performance scenes at the end. Despite Clara's absence from most other Disney media, Clara has remained a major supporting character in the Disney Comic universe. She is usually seen with the rest of the \\"classic\\" Disney cast. In most adaptations, she is seen speaking properly rather than her usual clucks from her appearance in Disney cartoons. She is usually portrayed as one of Daisy's best friends, not to say her best friend, in American, Italian, Danish, Dutch and Brazilian comic stories. Clara Cluck has appeared in the Disney parks as a meetable character. She has also been seen in shows and parades. =Jos√© Carioca= Jos√© Carioca is a green, Brazilian parrot who first appears in the Disney film Saludos Amigos (1942) alongside Donald Duck. He returned in the 1944 film The Three Caballeros along with Donald and a Mexican rooster named Panchito Pistoles. Jos√© is from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (thus the name \\"Carioca\\", which is a term used for a person born in Rio de Janeiro). =Panchito Pistoles= Panchito Pistoles is a red, Mexican rooster who was created as the third titular caballero (along with Donald Duck and Jos√© Carioca) for the 1944 film The Three Caballeros. Later he appeared in several Disney comics, including a year-long run in the Silly Symphony Sunday comic strip (1944-1945), as well as Don Rosa's comic book stories The Three Caballeros Ride Again (2000) and The Magnificent Seven (Minus 4) Caballeros (2005). =Gyro Gearloose= Gyro Gearloose is a tall, anthropomorphic chicken who is a scientist and inventor. He first appeared in the Carl Barks comic \\"Gladstone's Terrible Secret\\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #140, May 1952), and was the regular lead character in 4-page backup stories in Barks' issues of Uncle Scrooge, starting with issue #13 (March 1956) and continuing through #41 (March 1963). =Rockhead Rooster= Rockhead Rooster is a character who first appeared in a 1959 Daisy's Diary story, \\"The Double Date\\" by Carl Barks. He later became a recurring minor character, making various other printed appearances in recent years. He is Clara Cluck's pen pal, and when he comes to Duckburg, Clara and Daisy decide to have a double date, Clara taking Rockhead and Daisy taking Donald. Donald and Rockhead get along so well that they do not pay enough attention to their girlfriends, as he agrees with Donald on everything. =Jubal Pomp= Jubal Pomp (Filo Sganga) is a fat, chicken-faced tycoon created by Romano Scarpa in 1961. His main ambition is to become as rich as Scrooge McDuck. His attempts at gaining wealth tend to be disastrous. When he tries to compete with Scrooge, he markets eccentric products (firefly-powered mood lights, for instance) that meet with varied success at best. When he tries to convince Scrooge to become partners in some project, the result is Jubal being kicked out of Scrooge's office. Jubal sometimes helps Brigitta MacBridge try to get back at Scrooge by setting up businesses to rival his. On these occasions Jubal is more successful. He first appeared in \\"Zio Paperone e il ratto di Brigitta\\" (published in the US as \\"The Secret of Success\\" in Uncle Scrooge #338), Topolino #272 (February 12, 1961).Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone e il ratto di Brigitta He appears as an upstart businessman who happens to overhear Scrooge mentioning his \\"Secret of Prosperity\\". Convinced that the contents of the Secret would open his path to true wealth, he sought to blackmail Scrooge. He abducted Brigitta McBridge, Scrooge's stalker/love interest and asked the contents of the Secret as ransom. Scrooge was at first reluctant if he should rescue her or take the opportunity to be free of her obsessive pursuit. However he finally decided on retrieving his lady and managed to locate Jubal's hiding place and launch a successful rescue operation. He also took the opportunity to explain that his \\"Secret of Prosperity\\" were the virtues which led him to wealth, not some kind of shortcut. Jubal is bright and creative but his money making schemes are at times both clumsy and impractical. On his own Jubal is more of a nuisance than an actual threat. However Brigitta has decided that one way to impress Scrooge is prove her own worth as a businesswoman. Pulling her resources with Jubal, the duo have been able to launch a number of locally successful business operations in Duckburg. Providing true competition to Scrooge and often breaking his hold on a certain market. It helps that Brigitta appears to be equally resourceful to Scrooge in launching out new operations and surpaces him in the marketing and advertisement process. With her as a partner, Jubal enjoys much more success. There are a few stories that hint to him seeing Brigitta as more than a business partner and friend but they are not really romantically involved. =Emil Eagle= Emil Eagle first appeared in Uncle Scrooge #63 (May 1966) as a rival inventor for Gyro Gearloose, in the story \\"The Evil Inventor\\" by Vic Lockman. Later on, he was adopted into the Mickey Mouse universe as an enemy for Mickey Mouse and his friends, in particular Super Goof. Emil has caused a lot of trouble for Mickey Mouse, Super Goof, Donald Duck, Scrooge McDuck, Gyro Gearloose, and other characters on various occasions. Sometimes he has teamed up with Black Pete, the Beagle Boys, Mad Madam Mim, or other bad guys in the Mickey Mouse universe or the Duck universe. There are two stories where John D. Rockerduck hires Emil to take advantage of his inventive genius. \\"Zio Paperone e la sfida robotica (Uncle Scrooge and the Robotic Challenge) and \\"Dog Eat Dog\\".Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone e la sfida roboticaInducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Dog Eat Dog Emil is particularly popular among Brazilian comic readers. In addition, he appeared as a small figurine in two different Italian collections with Disney characters made by De Agostini. Emil Eagle was a Boss in the videogame The Duckforce Rises in 2015. =Zantaf= Zantaf is an Italian character created by the comic writer Carlo Chendi and the cartoonist Luciano Bottaro. He debuted in the Italian story \\"Paperino missione Zantaf\\" (known in English as \\"Tycoonraker! or From Zantaf with Lumps!\\"), first published in Almanacco Topolino #142 (Oct 1968). In the story, Donald Duck is working for Scrooge McDuck's secret agency (called P.I.A. in Italian language). Zantaf is a mad scientist who wants to conquer the world by using stolen fortunes from rich men like Scrooge McDuck, and for this purpose he uses his scientific genius to build robots programmed to help him. Like Dr. No (from a James Bond film), Zantaf owns his own secret island. Since 2004 Zantaf has also appeared in some Danish stories. =Garvey Gull= Garvey Gull is a young, anthropomorphic seagull who is a mischievous, homeless orphan friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie. Donald does not think much of him. The character was created by writer Paul Halas and artist Daniel Branca, and debuted in the 2002 story \\"Junior Chuckwoods\\", first published in Eastern Europe. A big part of the stories where he has an important role were drawn by the Argentinian cartoonist Wanda Gattino, Branca's compatriot. Garvey's arch-enemy is Mr. Phelps, a rat-faced railway security guard who views Garvey as an outlaw and wants to drive him off the railway where he works. In Europe, Garvey's (British) English name is Sonny Seagull. Garvey is his name in American comics. =Baron Thieving= Baron Thieving (Finnish name: B√§r Lingonsylt) is an anthropomorphic pelican. He was designed and invented as the result of the Finnish Aku Ankka magazine's \\"design a villain\\" competition. He debuted in the story \\"The Baron Cordially Invites You\\", which was first printed in Aku Ankka #2016-48 (Nov 2016), and returned two years later in \\"The Return of the Baron\\", which appeared in Aku Ankka #2018-36 (Sept 2018). The first story was reprinted in Germany in 2018, and besides that, the Baron has never appeared in print outside of Finland. Baron Thieving is an aristocratic baron who likes to lead a flamboyant playboy lifestyle and throw lavish parties. However, his wealth is long since gone, so he has to resort to crime to fund his lifestyle, and he steals money and other valuable items in secret. Thieving is modelled after the classic \\"gentleman thief\\" character. He is also often accompanied by his pet dachshund Rollie. Dogface characters \\"Dogfaces\\" are humanoid characters whose faces resemble dogs. They are generally used in Disney comics as stand-ins for humans and appear to be the most common race in Duckburg, although they most often appear as unnamed extras. Many historical figures who appear in Donald Duck comic stories as characters (see below) are also portrayed as dogfaces. =Albert Quackmore= Albert Quackmore (Battista in Italian; Baptist in Indian English and German) is Scrooge's butler in Italian, and more recently Egmont Disney comics. Quackmore is tall and has a long dog- nose, but humanlike ears. His hair is generally shown as being brown and curly. He is loyal and dedicated to his boss, Scrooge, and not rarely he is in trouble because of all this loyalty and dedication, creating invariably funny situations. Quackmore's first official comic appearance was in the 1967 story \\"Zio Paperone e l'angolare di sicurezza\\" written by Rodolfo Cimino and illustrated by Massimo De Vita.Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Zio Paperone e l'angolare di sicurezza Quackmore has become one of the most frequently recurring characters in Scrooge's Italian stories and he is quite popular among Italian comic readers. =Beagle Boys= The Beagle Boys are a gang of criminals who are dedicated to an eternal, unsuccessful string of attempts to break into Scrooge's money bin and loot his fortune. Created by Carl Barks, the gang first appeared in the story \\"Terror of the Beagle Boys\\" (Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #134, November 1951), although in this story they only appear in the last frame and have no lines. The first story to feature the Beagle Boys in a major role is \\"Only a Poor Old Man\\" (Uncle Scrooge #1, March 1952), which serves as a template for virtually all future Beagle Boys appearances, and establishes them as a serious threat to Scrooge's fortune. One of the main figures in Scrooge's rogues gallery, the Beagle Boys have appeared in hundreds of stories created around the world, and even led their own comic book from 1964 to 1979. Beagle Brats The Beagle Brats are the nephews of the Beagle Boys, who first appeared in the 1965 story \\"That Motherly Feeling\\". They are a handful even for their equally-immoral parents, who often shift their guardianships to said main trio ‚Äî who, in turn, have no idea how to deal with them. The Brats seem to have a rivalry against the Junior Woodchucks, each seeing the others as their polar opposite. Though the triplets 1, 2 and 3 are usually the ones referred to as the Beagle Brats, there is evidence that any children of Beagle Boys who follow the family traditions at an early age can be referred to as Beagle Brats. Blackheart Beagle Blackheart Beagle, also known as Grandpa Beagle, is the grandfather, founder, and sometimes leader of the Beagle Boys. His first appearance was in the 1957 Carl Barks story \\"The Fantastic River Race\\" as Blackheart Beagle, and then showed up in the 1958 Barks story \\"The Money Well\\" as Grandpa Beagle. Blackheart Beagle started his career of misdeeds and dishonestly as a pirate captain on the Mississippi; his beloved boat was known as the River Witch. He had a history of ransoming and plundering merchandise boat on the large river, and served as the archenemy of Pothole McDuck. However, when Pothole's young nephew Scrooge joined forces with his uncle, Blackheart and his sons (whom he used as his crew) had met their match and were finally arrested after having succeeded in blowing up Scrooge's own boat, the Dilly Dollar. Swearing revenge on the Scottish duck, Blackheart served his sentence and moved to Calisota with his sons and his wife, ruling the place by fear and making a decent loot out of what he could steal from the local hillibillies. Bad luck was apparently after him, as the place where Scrooge McDuck, now one of the World's largest fortunes (ans soon to be the largest), happened to be precisely the unknown corner of Calisota that Blackheart had elected as his territory. He was arrested again, and when he was released, the rural area he loved to terrorized had turned, thanks to Scrooge's financial impulse, into a San Francisco-esque metropolis in which he did not really belong anymore. Blackheart Beagle was a Boss in the videogame The Duckforce Rises in 2015. Penny Beagle Penny Beagle is a young dognose girl and the daughter of the Beagle Boys' numerous cousins. She first appeared in 2005, in the Sergio Badino story \\"Arriva Penny\\". Unlike a majority of Beagle Boys, Penny is scrupulously honest and law-abiding (although she still wears a mask because of the family traditions), and she often visits her Duckburg uncles to try and redeem them. Granny Beagle Granny Beagle is the grandmother of the Beagle Boys. She closely resembles, and is often mistaken for Auntie Beagle, who is the aunt of the Beagle Boys. While the two are both featured mostly in comics, they are two separate characters. Granny first appeared in 1967 in a one-page gag in The Beagle Boys #5; her first full story was the 1969 story \\"The Flight of the Bumbleduck\\". Granny has been featured in numerous comics, and acts as the leader of the Beagle Boys at times. She is usually the one to come up with schemes, whether for a great heist or a jailbreak. Great Grandpappy Beagle Great Grandpappy Beagle, also known as Great Great Grandpappy Beagle or Grandpappy Beagle, is the great grandfather of the Beagle Boys who only appears in the 1975 comic story \\"Scrooge For A Day\\", and was mentioned later in the same year in \\"The Deep Sea Deed\\". He has the prison number ‚Äú1‚Äù, is greatly trusted by later generations of Beagles, which is perhaps somewhat foolish of them, as, being a Beagle, Great-Grandpappy is as shifty as they come. Prone to telling stories about the clan's past, he once told the Duckburg trio about their ancestor Beegul's ownership of all the water in the world. He makes his animated debut in the 2017 DuckTales series episode, \\"Last Christmas!\\" (voiced by Eric Bauza), ordering his great-grandchildren to steal all presents during Christmas party. =Azure Blue= Azure Blue is a character who first appeared as an evil miser in the Barks story \\"The Golden Helmet\\" in Four Color #408 (July 1952). In that story, he was revealed to be a descendant of Olaf the Blue (Viking discoverer of America according to that story) and he wanted to find a Golden Helmet so he can be king of North America and make everyone on the continent his slaves, but Donald Duck and his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie would not let that happen. Azure was assisted by Lawyer Sharky. He also appeared in the 1995 Don Rosa story \\"The Lost Charts of Columbus\\", pulling a similar scam. Azure also made a cameo appearance in Rosa's 1989 story \\"Return to Plain Awful\\" when he sees off the disguised Scrooge McDuck and Donald Duck and his three nephews at the Duckburg Airport, as well as the 1987 story \\"Nobody's Business\\", when Donald and the nephews had to find a more valuable treasure than the Golden Helmet. Azure's kinship to Olaf is questionable, since his lawyer, instead of showing evidence of it, asked for evidence in contrary from whoever doubted Azure to be descendant of Olaf. When Donald and the nephews found what Blue and Sharky believed to be evidence that a Phoenician prince named Hanno and his kin are the real owners of North America, Azure renamed himself Azure Hanno Blue. It can make people think Blue to be a surname Azure gave himself in order to claim to descend from Olaf in the very first place. =Akers McCovet= Akers McCovet is a slimy crook specializing in fraudulently getting his oily hands on real estate, who appeared in the 1989 Don Rosa story \\"His Majesty, McDuck\\". When Scrooge McDuck, abusing a legal loophole, declared Killmotor Hill and his Money Bin an independent nation, McCovet realized that Scrooge's fortune was no longer protected by American laws, and the police would not intervene; the very land he could seize from Scrooge, since the old duck had not even bothered to write laws of his own. Therefore, McCovet hired the Beagle Boys as a miniature army and took over McDuckland. However, the Beagle Boys were eventually defeated by Huey, Dewey and Louie; without his minions, Akers was defenseless, and after a quick sword fight with Scrooge, he was forced to give up the crown and thrown out of McDuckland. He was meant to appear in The Lost Charts of Columbus, but was cut from the story. =Stella Curfew= Stella Curfew (Finnish: Jaana Kapula) is a police officer who appears in the Donald Duck stories where Donald was still a small boy, living with his grandmother. The character was invented by Kari Korhonen and was the first Donald Duck character invented in Finland. =Doe Boys= The Doe Boys are a pair of crooks created by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard. They appeared for the first time in a story featuring 0.0. Duck & Mata Harrier, \\"Picnic\\".Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Picnic Most of the American stories where they took park were drawn by Tony Strobl, who revamped the original look of this duo, developed by Hubbard. They had a more human-like look and Strobl made them look like Carl Barks's dognoses (human faces with dog snouts). Besides, one of them became quite shorter than the original character. Strobl used the Doe Boys in various comic stories for the market outside of the USA during the 1970s whose events invariably also involved Donald Duck, his cousin Fethry and Uncle Scrooge McDuck. Donald and Fethry are generally working as reporters for Scrooge McDuck's newspaper, the Duckburg Chronicle, in those stories. Daisy Duck eventually also meets the Doe Boys, sometimes working also as a reporter for Scrooge's newspaper, sometimes working as a policewoman.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page for Daisy Duck's 1970s gallery Brazilian comic artists also produced various stories where the Doe Boys appear.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page with the stats for the Doe Boys The Doe Boys were used in two comic stories written by Lars Jensen and drawn by the Spanish cartoonist Jos√© Maria Manrique during the 2000s. More two stories with them written by Jensen were published in 2014.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Index to Lars Jensen's stories with the Doe Boys =Neighbor Jones= Neighbor J. Jones is Donald Duck's next door neighbor. He is portrayed as being as short-tempered as Donald, and more truculent. The yard between their respective homes often becomes a battlefield. The usual setting would be some argument or fight which would result in a huge mess for both Jones and Donald. Donald once even thought taking a vacation on a cruise ship would get him thousands of miles away from Jones and other problems, only to realize Jones bought a ticket on the same cruise by coincidence. The captain of the ship, however, is quick to extinguish bickering by threatening to throw both in the brig, and later on Donald and Neighbor Jones actually have to work together when they are stranded at sea. The character first appeared in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #34 (in July 1943). There and in later issues, he tended to appear in stories featuring Donald Duck. Neighbor Jones was the first of many recurring characters that Carl Barks created.* Jones has since appeared in hundreds of additional stories, with writers Paul Halas (UK) and Jan Kruse (Netherlands) among the most frequent to use the character. The character has made more appearances in American comics. Although Neighbor Jones is largely an adversary, he will be pleasant with Donald on occasion, such as Donald offering Jones money to clear his yard during a snowstorm after seeing how efficiently Jones had shoveled his own driveway. Jones does the job, and courteously announces he is finished after Donald presents payment. In various Italian stories Jones is replaced by a similar character named Anacleto Mitraglia, who is taller and narrower than Jones, but with a similar personality and practically the same rivalry with Donald. Jones is actually rarely used in Italian stories. Mitraglia evolved from one of several names given to the real Jones in early Barks stories. In one Barks story (Uncle Scrooge #6, 1954), Jones was given the first name of \\"Jughead\\". However, this caused a copyright conflict with Archie Comics and the name was quickly discontinued. He makes his animated debut in the 2017 DuckTales series episode, \\"Whatever Happened to Donald Duck?!\\" (voiced by James Adomian), as Donald's anger management counselor, whom Donald's nephew Dewey and the boy's friend Webby run into while chasing down a mystery to solve. =Jeeves= Jeeves (Italian: Lusky) is John D. Rockerduck's secretary. The character was created in Italy in the 1970s. Rockerduck depends greatly on him, much in the same way as Scrooge McDuck depends on his butler Albert Quackmore. Unlike Scrooge, Rockerduck has rarely been shown to have any family, so when Rockerduck goes on an adventure, Jeeves fills the role of a supporting adventurer, which would be served by Donald Duck in Scrooge's case. Jeeves is usually drawn to appear slightly younger than Quackmore, with short black hair. Like Quackmore, Jeeves takes great pride in being a dedicated helper of his boss, but he will sometimes resort to criminal activity if pressed to by his master. Rockerduck and Jeeves have worn different disguises to trick Scrooge in some Italian stories. Jeeves has been shown confiding with Quackmore, without the consent or knowledge of either of their respective bosses. Jeeves made has first animated appearance in the 2017 DuckTales series episode, \\"The Outlaw Scrooge McDuck!\\", voiced by Keith Ferguson and reimagined as Rockerduck's muscular enforcer. He later reappears as an agent of F.O.W.L., having been artificially reconstructed as \\"Frankenjeeves\\" to act as Rockerduck's caretaker while he is in suspended animation. =Captain Ramrod= Captain Ramrod is a strong, broad-shouldered, square-jawed woman who used to work as an army engineer. When she retired, she became a troop leader for the Chickadees Patrol, putting her background knowledge (and intimidating discipline) to good use. Ramrod shares most of the Chickadees' strong rivalry with the Junior Woodchucks, and, while she is too honorable to truly cheat, she is not above striking when the Woodchucks are down, such as challenging them at a woodcraft contest just when their woodcraft counsellor was unavailable. =Arpin Lus√®ne= Arpin Lus√®ne, nicknamed Le Chevalier Noir (The Black Knight), is a French gentleman, and a notorious thief with, naturally, a cheesy French accent which other characters have hard time understanding at times, often leading to wordplay. Apparently, Lus√®ne even writes in his accent, spelling English words phonetically as he would pronounce them. His home has been said to be a castle in Portofino on the Italian Riviera, although he has also been described as coming from the French Riviera. He is a sticky fingered thief. On some occasions he is even seen stealing people's clothes while the victims are wearing them. His life's goal is to steal Scrooge McDuck's money, or make it disappear to make people think he stole it. His motive for this is to be remembered as the greatest thief ever to exist, rather than to make a profit out of it, as he has plenty of money already. Lus√®ne strictly refuses to appear in any photographs, claiming he has never been photographed. He likes to use his extreme dexterity to avoid being photographed. He once removed the filament from the lightbulb of a camera's flash, without breaking the bulb glass. Usually on his appearances, Lus√®ne wears an armor of a knight, almost completely covered in Gyro Gearloose's invention, a universal solvent which has the ability of absorbing all kinds of matter, excluding diamonds. Only Lus√®ne's hands, feet, and the handle of his sword are not coated with the universal solvent, and even this only so that he will not accidentally dissolve the floor he walks on or his own sword. Lus√®ne has appeared in several stories, the first one being The Black Knight in 1998. This story was mainly the introduction to the character as well as a sequel to the story The Universal Solvent. As the main plot, Arpin comes to Duckburg in order to rob the Money Bin. His first attempt fails, however he steals the universal solvent and uses it to make his special armor to make another, successful attack on the Bin. Scrooge, with the help of Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, manage to stop him. Lus√®ne's next appearance was in the story Attaaaaaack in which Scrooge stops his new plot to raid the Money Bin thanks to an invention of Gyro's. His third appearance was in Rosa's The Black Knight GLORPS Again which is a direct sequel to events in The Black Knight and Arpin restores his suit in it. So far the only use of him by creators other than Don Rosa (such as Marco Rota) has been on covers. Arpin is the only present day character that Don Rosa has created for the Duck Universe that has made more than one appearance. His name comes from a spoonerism of Ars√®ne Lupin, a fictional character from novels by Maurice Leblanc. The switcheroo spelling is ironic, partly because Leblanc himself once changedArs√®ne Lupin and Sherlock Holmes the spelling of the name of a character (who was \\"visiting\\", in a way, from the works of another author) from \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" to \\"Herlock Sholmes\\", in response to legal objections from the author (Arthur Conan Doyle) who was the original creator of Sherlock Holmes. In the Swedish translation, his name is \\"Armand Lutin\\", a play on \\"Ars√®ne Lupin\\". =Maurice Mattressface= Maurice Mattressface first appeared in Uncle Scrooge #10 in a story called The Fabulous Philosopher's Stone. In that story he confiscated the stone from Scrooge McDuck because he was afraid that he might use it to wreck the Gold Market. In The Crown of the Crusader Kings by Don Rosa, he was shown as working for Mr. Molay as an employee of The International Money Council. In The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home, he betrays his boss after finding out that he wants to use the treasure of Castle McDuck for evil purposes. =Chisel McSue= Chisel McSue is an enemy of Scrooge McDuck. Scrooge almost lost his fortune because he could not produce a single heirloom. He also accused Scrooge of not being a true Scot. Scrooge and his nephews managed to defeat him after staging a mock Battle of Culloden. In the DuckTales episode Down and Out in Duckburg, a character named Fritter O'Way with the same background took over Scrooge's fortune until Scrooge recovered the cargo sunk with Seafoam McDuck's ship, the Golden Goose. His ancestor, Swindle McSue, is the guy who sabotaged Seafoam McDuck's boat in 1776. Because of that incident Scrooge almost lost his fortune. =Scottie McTerrier= Scottie McTerrier was appointed caretaker of the McDuck Castle by Scrooge McDuck in 1902. He died in 1948. Sometime after Scottie died, Matilda McDuck took over the castle. His name was first mentioned in The Old Castle's Secret by Carl Barks, but his true first appearance was in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Part 9: The Billionaire of Dismal Downs, by Don Rosa. =McViper Clan= The McViper Clan first appeared in Uncle Scrooge #56 in The Mystery of the Ghosttown Railroad. In that story they try to scare Scrooge McDuck and his nephews with ravens dressed as ghosts, in order to steal the deeds to the local railroad. When a defense contractor wishes to acquire the railroad track for rocket testing, this causes a significant increase in the railroad's shares, meaning a tremendous windfall for Scrooge and a few other residents of the Western town of Goldopolis, who were the only investors. The McViper gang attempted to steal the deeds in order to prevent sale of the railroad track, and that modern changes in Goldopolis would mean the end of the memories of them as outlaws. Actually only one of them appeared in that story and his name was Copperhead McViper, and stated he was the last McViper due to the rest of the gang having died of old age. Another McViper by the name of Snake McViper appeared in The Cattle King in Uncle Scrooge #69 where he tried to antagonize Scrooge and his nephews. Surprisingly Snake is a pignose and not a dogface like Copperhead. Don Rosa used The McViper Clan in The Life and Times of Scrooge Part 3 where two of them who go by the names Snake Eyes and Haggis infiltrate Murdo Mackenzie and his posse while they plan to rustle Murdo's prize bull Vindicator but Scrooge outwits them. This is supposedly the first encounter that Scrooge has had with The McViper Clan. Either Snake Eyes or Haggis is the father of Copperhead but it is unknown which one. In Part 11 Copperhead and two of his brothers try to steal some papers from Scrooge but they do not succeed. The name McViper is a pun on the word viper, a type of venomous snake. All of The McVipers' names have references to snakes, except for Haggis, which is a Scottish dish. Snake is obviously not related to the rest of The McViper Clan. He just has the same last name as the rest of them, since he happens to be a pig and the rest of them are dogs. It may be possible the brothers accepted him into their gang and allowed him to use \\"McViper\\" in order to show his gang membership. It is unknown whether or not The McViper Clan appeared in any stories other than the aforementioned stories written by Carl Barks and Don Rosa. =Mr. Molay= Mr. Molay is a comics character who first appeared in the story The Crown of the Crusader Kings in Uncle Scrooge #339. In that story he is known to be the head of The International Money Council. He and his associate Maurice Mattressface confiscate a crown from Scrooge McDuck and his nephews. He also appears in the story titled The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter From Home, in which he and Maurice plan to steal the treasure from Scrooge's old ancestral castle and using Scrooge's sister Matilda to get it. Later in that story Maurice betrayed Mr. Molay. Mr. Molay has only appeared in these two stories. He is named after Jacques de Molay, last Grand Master of the Knights Templar. =Whiskerville Clan= The Whiskerville Clan first appeared in Uncle Scrooge #29 in \\"Hound of the Whiskervilles\\" by Carl Barks, where Scrooge McDuck and his nephews find out that the Whiskervilles have been using their hound costume to frighten The Clan McDuck for centuries. The hound ruse caused the McDuck family to vacate the castle in 1675, giving the Whiskervilles opportunity to search for hidden treasure. At the end of that story Scrooge and the last member of the Whiskerville family eventually become friends. The Whiskervilles returned in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Parts 1, 5, and 9, where they continued to antagonize The McDucks. In Part 1, they run Scrooge and his father off by using the hound costume, but Scrooge gets back at them by impersonating the Ghost of Sir Quackly McDuck. In Part 5, they try to steal a bank draft from Scrooge so they can legally buy Castle McDuck to tear it down, but Scrooge stops them with supernatural help from the ghosts of his ancestors. In Part 9, only one Whiskerville appears, but he does not cause too much trouble in that story. He appears as a sheep owner while Scrooge competes in a Scottish games sheep shearing contest. After that the Whiskervilles do not make any more appearances in the Scrooge McDuck story line. Human characters These characters are not anthropomorphic animals but actual (or former) humans. =Bombie the Zombie= Bombie the Zombie first appeared in the story \\"Voodoo Hoodoo\\" in Four Color #238. In that story, Bombie gives a voodoo doll to Donald Duck, thinking that Donald is Scrooge McDuck. Bombie was sent by a witch doctor named Foola Zoola to get revenge on Scrooge for destroying his village many years ago. Huey, Dewey, and Louie befriended the zombie and helped him get back to Africa while Donald tried to find a cure for the Voodoo Curse, eventually succeeding. Though he had been sent after Scrooge, Bombie never came in direct contact with Scrooge during this story. In Don Rosa's The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Part 11, it was revealed that Bombie had been stalking Scrooge for decades prior to \\"Voodoo Hoodoo\\". In order to force Foola Zoola to sell him some valuable rubber plantation land, Scrooge hired a gang of thugs and destroyed Zoola's village. Scrooge then disguised himself and tricked Zoola long enough to close the deal by making Zoola think the land would be safe with him. Zoola realized the trick, and set Bombie on Scrooge. After the first time Bombie found him, Scrooge turned back to his normal look, keeping Bombie from recognizing him and explaining why Bombie would later mistake Donald for Scrooge (in \\"Voodoo Hoodoo\\"). Although this saved Scrooge from the curse, Bombie continued to pursue Scrooge thanks to Zoola's magic. Bombie followed Scrooge to the North Pole, an iceberg near the RMS Titanic, and finally to the isle of Ripan Taro. Cornered by the zombie, Scrooge agreed to give a local sorcerer the valuable candy-stripped ruby in exchange for a spell to trap Bombie on Ripan Taro for 30 years. Scrooge took the deal, assuming that the curse would wear off by the time Bombie could leave the island. Except for a few cameos, Bombie did not make any further appearances in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, but later returned in a dream where Scrooge had a flashback of the Titanic scene. Bombie made his animation debut in the DuckTales episode \\"The Richest Duck in the World\\", voiced by Fred Tatasciore. Here, Bombie's pursuit of Scrooge is the result of a general curse that afflicts whoever is the richest person in the world at any given time. Though he could not defeat it, Scrooge managed to trap Bombie on a deserted island and sealed him away within an enchanted bin. However, when Scrooge's great-nephew Louie gets his hands on his great-uncle's fortune (as the result of a previous episode) and uses the money for frivolous means, he inadvertently cuts the \\"magical security\\" budget funding the trap, releasing Bombie. After going on an unstoppable rampage, Bombie is only stopped when Louie and Scrooge show humility and learn that wealth cannot solve all of one's problems; giving the monster a shoe-shine before he departs from Duckburg and dispels the curse. =Madam Mim=Hard Haid Moe= Hard Haid Moe is a hillbilly and unlike most other characters in the Donald Duck universe indubitably a human being.Did You Know? Hard Haid Moe \\"Perhaps \\"Hog Haid Moe\\" was meant to imply a pigfaced character, but artist Al Hubbard drew Moe as a big-nosed human.\\" Moe was created by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard. His first appearance was in the story It's music (1964). In the 1960s and 1970s, he was used in various comic stories, usually as a supporting character for Fethry Duck, Donald Duck and Scrooge McDuck. Fethry is actually one of very few townspeople ever befriended by Moe, but their relation is not exactly friendly. Most of those stories were drawn by Tony Strobl. However, Moe would eventually disappear from North American and European stories, but became popular in Brazil, where he even had his own title (Urtig√£o) from 1987 to 1994.Papersera ‚Äî Brazilian Covers: Urtig√£o In Italy, where he is called Dinamite Bla, his appearances has become more frequent since the 2000s (decade) and he has even gained a small Italian figurine from a special collection with various Disney characters simply called Disney Collection, made by De Agostini. Hard Haid Moe lives somewhere on Calisota's countryside with his rather flabby dog, Houn' Dawg. Moe is often seen carrying a shotgun. Brazilian cartoonists created a permanent female character for Moe's stories, a funny maid called Firmina (original Brazilian name), who is reluctantly hired by Moe in the story \\"Uma Intrusa Especiar\\" (free translation: \\"An Unusual Newcomer\\"),Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Uma Intrusa Especiar and because of her strong and daring personality she is often arguing with Moe, who in turn has a very hard temperament. She became a kind of non- official girlfriend of Moe, including she almost married him. Amy Lou is the name of Moe's niece who appeared in the comic story \\"Marriage Mountain-style\\" by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard.Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Marriage Mountain-style In this story she wants to find a husband, and Donald and Fethry become involuntarially her suitors. In Italian stories, Moe has a neighbor and rival named Truz, a dogface character who wears a tuxedo and a crooked top hat. =Witch Hazel= Witch Hazel is a fictional character appearing in productions of The Walt Disney Company. She first appeared in the Donald Duck cartoon Trick or Treat in 1952, voiced by June Foray, where she helps Huey, Dewey, and Louie get candy from Donald. She also appeared in the Carl Barks's comic book adaptation and two sequels to that story, \\"Too Late for Christmas\\" in Donald Duck Adventures (Gladstone Series) #30 in December 1994 and \\"The Poorest Duck in Duckburg\\" in Donald Duck Adventures (Gladstone Series) #35 in October 1995. Witch Hazel has a broom named Beelzebub, which acts as both her servant and her mode of transport. In Disney comics she appeared as working with other Disney witches such as Magica De Spell and Mad Madam Mim. Witch Hazel is also seen in some Italian Disney comics, where she is called Nocciola (Italian for \\"hazelnut\\"; full name Nocciola Vildibranda Crapomena), notably those by Luciano Bottaro. Her name, a pun on the name of the North American shrub and the herbal medicine derived from it, witch hazel, has been commonly used for the names of cartoon witches; Warner Bros., MGM, Famous Studios, and the Little Lulu comic book also had characters named \\"Witch Hazel\\", and Rembrandt Films had one named \\"Hazel Witch\\". Animator Chuck Jones, of his own admission, got the idea of Looney Tunes Witch Hazel from the Disney short, creating a different character but again using June Foray for the voice. The Disney Witch Hazel had a very different appearance from her Looney Tunes counterpart. She is short, has a hairy, warty chin and a large red nose with green eyes. She wears a long blonde wig (although occasionally it is grey), dresses in archetypal black witches clothes, and her hat is very tall. She is also far more benevolent than the Looney Tunes version. The Disney Witch Hazel never became as popular as Magica De Spell or Mad Madam Mim. But, in Italian Disney comics, she has been for a long time an oft-used and well-liked character. Usually, her stories show her interactions not with the Duck Clan, but with Goofy (the only exception are the stories Il dottor Paperus, parody of Goethe's Faust in the 1950s, and its sequel Paperino e il seguito della storia, published in 1999). This is due to her irritation at Goofy's staunch refusal to believe in magic or witches of any sort, believing instead that real magic is the same as regular trick magic, and that those claiming to be magicians (including Hazel) are crazy. This leads to several amusing adventures where Hazel uses every spell in the book to try to convince Goofy of the existence of \\"real\\" magic, despite continued failure. She also appears to be the first boss of the NES game Mickey Mousecapade, despite being originally a good character. Witch Hazel appeared as a guest in Disney's House of Mouse. In one 1965 story (\\"The Dime From Uncle\\" from The Beagle Boys #2), she was known as Wanda Witch. = J. Audubon Woodlore = J. Audubon Woodlore is the park ranger of Brownstone National Park (a play on Yellowstone National Park), one of the features of which is a geyser named \\"Old Fateful\\" (a play on Old Faithful). He was originally voiced by Bill Thompson. Woodlore's name is an inside joke-reference to John James Audubon, the famous 19th Century ornithologist/naturalist/painter. He is currently voiced by Corey Burton and Jeff Bennett. He first appeared in two 1954 Donald Duck cartoons Grin and Bear It and Grand Canyonscope. (It is revealed in the latter that Woodlore was a postal worker prior to his Ranger days.) One year later, in Beezy Bear, he repeatedly admonishes Humphrey the Bear \\"You bathe too much!\\", not realising that the bear is really just hiding in the pond from the bees whose honey he was trying to steal. Woodlore prides himself on running a tight ship and is frequently oblivious to those (particularly Donald) who are humiliated and/or insulted by his constant scoldings and criticisms. Despite his somewhat authoritarian attitude, he cares about the bears as if they were his children...although he once bamboozled them into cleaning up the park for him (so that he could nap in a hammock) by singing the jazzy ditty \\"In the Bag\\". When Woodlore's lazy motive became apparent, the bears irritably bagged him along with the litter. Most of the bears are respectful of Woodlore, except Humphrey the Bear, whom the Ranger often lectures. The Ranger also made an appearance in Down and Out With Donald Duck (also known as A Duckumentary), a mockumentary about Donald Duck's infamous temper, where he is out of uniform, now working in an employment agency where Donald seeks a job. Woodlore's name appeared on the entrance sign at Disneyland's Bear Country land, as the resident park ranger. Woodlore most recently appeared in an episode of Disney's House of Mouse. Pig charactersHerbert= Herbert is a not especially bright pig friend of Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck. He first appeared in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #43 in the Donald Duck story entitled \\"Three Dirty Little Ducks\\". He then appeared in a few other Barks stories, including \\"The Fifty Dollar Dime\\" in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #50. He has recently made appearances in Disney comics produced in the Netherlands. =Porker Hogg= Porker Hogg is a rival of Angus Pothole McDuck. He hired the original Beagle Boys to destroy McDuck's boat but then they double crossed him. Porker's nephew Horseshoe Hogg challenged Scrooge McDuck to finish the race their uncles started in 1870, but in the imaginary part of Ducktales, he was a thug who worked for the Beagle Boys. =Argus McSwine= Argus McSwine is an enemy of Scrooge McDuck and Donald Duck. He appears in many stories, both by Carl Barks and others. Sometimes he has the Beagle Boys working for him. His first appearance was in Forbidden Valley by Carl Barks, published in Donald Duck #54. McSwine has appeared in many Egmont-produced Disney stories in which he antagonizes Donald more than he does Scrooge. Argus is a lot like Neighbor Jones in this function‚Äîexcept that he does not live next door to Donald, and is often a crook or con man (whereas Jones is generally on the side of law and order). Often portrayed as rich, McSwine sometimes competes with Scrooge for some type of prize in much the way that Flintheart Glomgold or John D. Rockerduck also do. Argus is in fact one of the most evil villains in the Scrooge stories, having openly shot at the ducks and threatened them with harm in a manner that the Beagle Boys rarely do. From the 1950s to the 1980s, McSwine had no consistent name and was known only as \\"the pig villain\\", going by a number of one-time aliases including John the Con and Porkman De Lardo. The last name McSwine comes from Carl Barks' Donald the Milkman. In 1990, then-editor Bob Foster published that story for the first time in the USA. At the same time, the decision was taken that McSwine should be the character's \\"real\\" name, with the first name Argus being added at the same time. Thus the pig villain has remained Argus McSwine in many other stories through 2010, with only the occasional alias used in more modern times (Lardo J. Porkington in Lars Jensen's The Nest Egg). =Peter Pig= Peter Pig is a fictional pig in Disney short films and comics of the 1930s. He was introduced in The Wise Little Hen (1934),The Wise Little Hen . The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts . Retrieved on March 17, 2008. in which he was the lazy and greedy friend of his much more famous fellow first-appearance character, Donald Duck. Peter Pig's second and last Disney film appearance was in The Band Concert (1935),The Band Concert . The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts . Retrieved on March 17, 2008. in which Peter played trumpet and a smaller, similar pig called Paddy Pig played the tuba. Peter later made a cameo in a Toontown scene of Who Framed Roger Rabbit during \\"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile\\". The brief film career was followed by a just as brief comics career. Federico Pedrocchi, the Italian who created the first long Donald Duck comics in the magazine Paperino e altre avventure, used Peter Pig as Donald's sidekick in three stories: Special Correspondent (1938), Paperino fra i pellirosse (1939) and Paperino chiromante (1939). In the Garden area of Disney Castle in Kingdom Hearts II, there is a topiary sculpture of Peter Pig. Peter Pig also appears on one of the first artworks for the video game Epic Mickey. =Pig Mayor= The Pig Mayor is an anthropomorphic pig whose name was actually created especially to refer to the character in Carl Barks's stories who governs the fictional city of Duckburg. Barks never worried about naming this mayor, including using dogfaces with different looks to be shown as mayors of Duckburg in early comic stories, and he never named them, too.Carl Barks (Danish website) ‚Äî Secondary Characters ‚Äî The Mayors Despite all the irrelevance that Barks used to give to this creation, the Pig Mayor became an essential character in this particular universe, being largely used in Italian and Danish comic stories.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Page with the stats for \\"Pig Mayor\\" He is also a recurring character in Brazilian and Dutch ones. In Italy, the look of the Pig Mayor has changed a bit through the years and some cartoonists have drawn him with brown hair. He has been used in various Italian stories where Scrooge McDuck and John D. Rockerduck both are involved in some competition. =Soapy Slick= Soapy Slick is the crooked saloon operator and profiteer in the Scrooge McDuck comic series, modeled after Jefferson Randolph \\"Soapy\\" Smith of Skagway, Alaska. He is one of the oldest of Scrooge McDuck's enemies. He was introduced by Carl Barks in North of the Yukon. Don Rosa illustrated The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Chapter 8: The King of the Klondike documents Scrooge's Alaskan prospecting days (1896 or thereabouts). Scrooge secures a loan from Soapy. Soapy, being a saloon owner on land and water (he owns a gambling boat), has plenty of money to lend. Of course, at a more than suitable interest rate (it was 10% at the turn of the 20th century). Soapy then swindles Scrooge ‚Äî the pocket of land Scrooge wants to pan on has already been identified as having no gold ‚Äî and Soapy goes ahead and gives him the loan anyway. Soapy adds another 0 to the 10 and makes the interest on the loan 100% and then tries to collect on the loan in Uncle Scrooge #59. Luckily, Scrooge manages to produce the loan-paid receipt. Eventually, Scrooge goes to the Yukon and strikes gold in Uncle Scrooge #292. However, he is kidnapped by Soapy, who binds Scrooge to the smokestack of the casino boat with chains and taunts Scrooge by making fun of Scrooge's dead mother. Scrooge becomes enraged and tears the smokestack down by pulling on the chains, sinking Soapy's casino boat. Other anthropomorphic charactersTachyon Farflung= Tachyon Farflung is a monkey-like alien whose first appearance was in the Danish comic story \\"The Terror From Outer Space\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Terror From Outer Space where he becomes a relatively important foe of Scrooge McDuck. Tachyon is shown as a notorious intergalactic thief who hid himself on the planet Melbar, described as crime capital of the universe. He discovers Scrooge's fortune by using an interstellar spyscope. Then Tachyon comes to Earth on his spaceship determined to steal Scrooge's Money Bin. Like Princess Oona, Tachyon Farflung is a comic character developed through a partnership between the Swedish couple Stefan and Unn Printz-P√•hlson and the Chilean cartoonist Vicar. Tachyon's original skin color is green, but some countries showed him with light creamy skin. This character appeared in more than five comic stories. =Woimly Filcher= Woimly Filcher is an anthropomorphic male cat created by William Van Horn who is similar to another Disney character, Pete. He appeared for the first time in the Danish story \\"Deck Us All!\\",Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story Deck Us All! where he is shown as a close friend of Jones. Nevertheless, this fellowship was not explored in any of Woimly's later stories. Woimly is always smoking a cigar like the original Pete used to do. He became a relatively important rival to Donald Duck. Woimly likes to provoke Donald by showing unbearable arrogance when they are in some contest against each other. =Pete= Pete is a large, menacing black cat who appears in several Donald Duck short films and in DuckTales. He is usually more closely associated with the Mickey Mouse universe where he has remained a central figure since Steamboat Willie. =Lawyer Sharky= Sylvester J. Sharky appears to be an anthropomorphic rat, with a huge droop-snoot nose upon which a pair of pince-nez spectacles are perched. In The Golden Helmet (1952), the first story in which he appears, he provides legal advice to Azure Blue, who claims to be owner of North America, because he is a descendant of Olaf the Blue, a Viking explorer who discovered America in 901 AD. Whenever Sharky was asked to prove his client (Blue or whoever he was working for) to descend from Olaf, he replies asking the questioner to prove he is not. Sharky often speaks in fake legal Latin, like \\"Hocus, locus, jocus\\", which means \\"To the landlord belong the doorknobs\\". Lawyer Sharky seldom has a large role, but he is often seen in cameo appearances. In The Lost Charts of Columbus, believing a Phoenician prince named Hanno to have made a claim to North America before anybody else, he helped Azure Blue, now Azure \\"Hanno\\" Blue, to \\"prove\\" his kinship to Hanno. In The Poorest Duck in Duckburg he helps Scrooge McDuck cancel Halloween by spending his money on all the Halloween stuff in Duckburg. =Red Eye and his brother= Red Eye and his brother are two ratfaced thugs who were introduced as pirates in Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold (October, 1942). They typically serve as henchmen under Black Pete or other villains with more dominant personalities. Animals This section contains animal characters who act like animals, unlike the majority of characters in this article who are highly anthropomorphized animals and act like humans. =Aracuan Bird= The Aracuan Bird, also called the Clown of the Jungle, first appeared in the feature film The Three Caballeros (1944); though, despite his apparent on-screen popularity, strangely he did not appear in the comic book adaptation of that film. During the segment \\"Aves Raras\\" (or \\"rare birds\\"), Donald is watching a film about South American birds when the film's narrator introduces the Aracuan as \\"one of the most eccentric birds you have ever seen\\". The Aracuan proceeds to walk right out of the film along the projectors' light beam and into Donald's life. This crazy bird drives Donald nuts not only in this film, but again in the cartoon short \\"Clown of the Jungle\\" (1947), and then once more in the feature film Melody Time segment called \\"Blame it on the Samba\\" (1948) where he attempts to cheer up the \\"blue\\" (literally) Donald Duck and Jos√© Carioca. Like Panchito Pistoles and Jos√© Carioca, the Aracuan Bird is primarily known only from these three films in the USA. However, he has found some success in comics from Brazil where he is known as Foli√£o. More recently the Aracuan Bird has appeared in Mickey Mouse Works and Disney's House of Mouse, and is a regular cast member in Legend of the Three Caballeros as \\"Ari the Caretaker\\". He causes hilarious practical jokes and dons various disguises (including posing as Donald Duck). Often Donald is shown trying to take a photo of the bird, with it evading his efforts. In Norway & Sweden the cartoon \\"Clown of the Jungle\\" is shown as part of the From All of Us to All of You, a Disney Christmas special shown on television every Christmas Eve at 3 pm, although the Swedish censorship edits out the part where Donald attacks the Aracuan with a machine gun. The crazy Aracuan, with its flaming red hair, hot pink face and fluorescent yellow feet, appears at first to be a completely fictional creation. However, there actually is a South American bird called the Aracuan (or Aracu√£, in contemporary Portuguese). The aracuan is the local name for the eastern Brazilian sub-species of the speckled chachalaca (Ortalis guttata). Chachalacas are moderately large tree-dwelling birds that belong the Cracid family, which also includes guans and curassows. Cracids are related to other galliformes, such as turkeys, and also share some characteristics with megapodes (such as the Australian malleefowl and brush-turkey). The very name chachalaca (from Paraguayan Spanish) refers to the noisy call of the bird. Around dawn, groups emit hoarse screams and \\"arapapiyas\\" that are similar to those produced by the Aracuan Bird in the Disney movie. However, the physical appearance of the bird is quite different, with a long tail, drab plumage and a much shorter beak. =Billy Goat= Billy Goat is one of the various farm animals that are treated as pets by Grandma Duck, but he certainly is the most known one. Billy is always ready to hit intruders with his horns. He was used by Carl Barks in ten stories of the comic series \\"Grandma Duck's Farm Friends\\".Coa-Inducks ‚Äî List of Carl Barks's stories with \\"Billy Goat\\" =Bolivar= Bolivar is a non-anthropomorphic St. Bernard dog belonging to Donald Duck. He first appeared in the Mickey Mouse cartoon Alpine Climbers where he rescued Pluto from freezing in the snow, the two later found by Mickey and Donald to be drunk on Bolivar's own brandy. He also appeared in the Silly Symphonies cartoon More Kittens under the name \\"Tolivar\\". Later on he appeared in the newspaper comic strips as Donald's dog. Ever since 1938,Starb√§ck, Per. \\"Bolivar\\". Disney Comics characters. 3 April 1999. Disney Comics. Bolivar has been a prominent member of the Duck family. He has even been used by Carl Barks as a companion for Huey, Dewey and Louie, and appears now and then in recent stories (the artist Daniel Branca had Bolivar as one of his favorite characters). In some comic strips Bolivar had a son named Behemoth, who disappeared without a trace later on. Bolivar has also been called Bornworthy and Bernie, as his name is rather controversial for being a Disney character (see Sim√≥n Bol√≠var). Nevertheless, from 1992 onward the original name Bolivar has almost always been used in the United States. He is thought to have been created by Al Taliaferro. In some dialects, Taliaferro rhymes with Bolivar. =Chip 'n' Dale= Chip and Dale are two chipmunks who appear in several Donald Duck short films. In most cartoons they are either antagonists against Pluto or more frequently against Donald Duck, and on very rare occasions Mickey Mouse. In the 1950s, they were finally given their own series, but only three cartoons were made; Chicken in the Rough (1951), Two Chips and a Miss (1952) and The Lone Chipmunks (1954). The chipmunks form a duo, similar to Laurel and Hardy, and can be told apart by their noses. Chip, the \\"straight man\\", has a small, black nose, whereas Dale, the \\"funny man\\", has a larger, pink nose. In 1989, Chip and Dale became the title characters in a new animated series, Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers, in which they formed a detective agency with new characters created for the show: female mouse inventor Gadget Hackwrench, muscular adventuring Australian mouse Monterey Jack, and Zipper the fly. While in the original shorts the duo are frequent troublemakers who are concerned only with themselves, in Rescue Rangers they are crime fighters who help the less fortunate. =General Snozzie= General Snozzie is the official bloodhound for the Junior Woodchucks of Duckburg. He has the ability to sniff out a substance on command. He sometimes joins Huey, Dewey, and Louie, Donald Duck, and Scrooge McDuck on their adventures. He first appeared in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #213 in the story Dodging Miss Daisy by Carl Barks, where he helped Daisy Duck and the boys track down Donald. In the story W.H.A.D.A.L.O.T.T.A.J.A.R.G.O.N. by Don Rosa, General Snozzie was just a puppy; back then he was called Major Snozzie. General Snozzie was not the only mascot of The Junior Woodchucks. Bolivar was a Junior Woodchucks mascot at one point, and Pluto also was a Junior Woodchucks mascot in some stories. = Herman Beetle = Herman appears in cartoon shorts as old man beetle telling the audience flashback stories of his youth and Donald Duck serves as his nemesis. He first appears in Bootle Beetle (1947) dodging Donald's attempts to catch him for his bug collection. His next appearance is in The Greener Yard (1949), in which he is tempted to have a go at Donald's vegetables. In the next short Sea Salts (1949), he is a long time friend of Donald, both of them marooned on an island. In the last short Morris the Midget Moose (1950) he narrates the story of the same name. His name is revealed in Mickey and the Beanstalk narrated by his friend Ludwig von Drake. =Hortense= Hortense was Scrooge McDuck's horse during his adventures in his youth. The mare was originally named Widowmaker, belonging to Murdo McKenzie. When Scrooge wanted to enlist as a cowboy in McKenzie's payroll, McKenzie offered him the job if he could successfully manage to ride his most violent-tempered horse. Scrooge would have fallen off the horse like everyone else before him, but his belt was accidentally caught in the saddle knob, keeping him in the saddle while the horse did her utmost to throw him off. Impressed by Scrooge's performance, McKenzie enlisted him as a cowboy and gave him the horse Widowmaker as a gift. Impressed by the horse's temper, Scrooge renamed her Hortense after his little sister, claiming both had equally bad tempers (much to his sister's chagrin). Tamed by Scrooge, Hortense later expressed impressive skills in galloping very fast, keeping her calm in dire situations and even controlling other animals. Hortense was also the name of the ostrich in the 1937 short Donald's Ostrich. =Houn' Dawg= Houn' Dawg is Hard Haid Moe's very loyal but very lazy dog. =Humphrey the Bear= Humphrey is a bear who appears in several Donald Duck short films. =Louie the Mountain Lion= Louie is a buffoonish and sometimes grumpy mountain lion who is an occasional enemy of Donald and Goofy. His cartoons often see him chasing after either Donald Duck or Goofy. He appears in Lion Around (1950), Hook, Lion and Sinker (1950), Lion Down (1951), Father's Lion (1952), and Grand Canyonscope (1954). He later reappears in the Mickey Mouse Works short Goofy's Big Kitty and in the House of Mouse episodes Goofy's Valentine Date and Pluto Saves the Day. =Ottoperotto= Ottoperotto is the Beagle Boys' pet dog. Unlike Pluto, Ottoperotto has a criminal mindset. =Poochie= Poochie is Fethry Duck's dog, who has an over-friendly personality. He appeared in some 1970s stories drawn by Tony Strobl.Coa-Inducks ‚Äî Index to stories with Poochie Some Brazilian cartoonists also used Fethry's little-known pet. =Porpy= Porpy is Moby Duck's nice and smart porpoise. =Ratface= Ratface is Magica De Spell's raven.Ratface at I.N.D.U.C.K.S. He is different from the raven named Poe in DuckTales, who is Magica's brother. =Ratty= Ratty was the Beagle Boys' pet cat. He first appears in \\"Sentimental Journey\\" by Tony Strobl, in which the Beagle Boys try to shoot at him through a door, thinking that they were being raided. This, however, causes significant damage to their hideout. Most of his later appearances were drawn by Jack Manning, appearing in twelve comics in the \\"Beagle Boys\\" series. Other instances of him include two comics by Peter Alvarado; \\"Ratty's Birthday Party\\" and \\"The Guardian Sword\\", one Italian comic, written by Ivan Saidenberg; \\"O Gato Gatuno\\" (\\"Cat Thief\\"), and one \\"Uncle Scrooge\\" series comic, drawn by Kay Wright; \\"The Stuffed Mattress\\", of which is his last appearance. = Spike the Bee = Spike, also called as Buzz-Buzz or Barrington, is a small aggressive bee who is frequently an enemy of Donald and Pluto. In many of his appearances he is on a quest to gather food. He appears in Window Cleaners (1940), Home Defense (1943), Pluto's Blue Note (1947), Inferior Decorator (1948), Bubble Bee (1949), Honey Harvester (1949), Slide, Donald, Slide (1949), Bee at the Beach (1950), Bee on Guard (1951) and Let's Stick Together (1952). He later reappears in the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse episodes Goofy's Bird, Minnie's Bee Story and Mickey's Little Parade as well in the Mickey Mouse short films Bee Inspired and New Shoes. =Tabby= Tabby is Donald's cat and he appeared for the first time in the story \\"The Health Nut\\" by Dick Kinney and Al Hubbard,Coa Inducks ‚Äî Page to the comic story The Health Nut where Fethry Duck also made his first appearance in comics. Tabby dislikes Fethry basically because he is full of crazy ideas that usually put Donald and him in trouble. This relation between Fethry and Tabby was quite explored in American and Brazilian comic stories starring Donald and Fethry. Tabby really likes his owner, Donald, but this does not refrain him from trying to catch a fish who lives in Donald's fishbowl. Like Poochie (Fethry Duck's dog) and Houn' Dawg (Hard Haid Moe's dog), Tabby is a pet whose thoughts are generally shown by comic writers, which is not the case of Bolivar (Donald Duck's dog), for example. = Yellow Beak = Yellow Beak is a green parrot with a wooden leg, wearing a red jacket and bandanna, a blue cape and a pirate hat. He was originally going to appear in the short film Morgan's Ghost which was set to feature Mickey Mouse, Donald, Goofy and Pete, but was cancelled. The first appearance of him goes back in the 01-page story Donald Duck Finds Pirate Gold (WDC #9) that was first published in October 1942, where he meets Donald, Huey, Dewey and Louie and they wind up searching for the lost treasure of Henry Morgan. = Smorgasbord = Smorgasbord, also known as Smorgie the Bad, is an ogre. Described by his owner Witch Hazel as her \\"pet ogre\\", Smorgasbord is a large monster who can be summoned thanks to a special witch's brew by his mistress. He is a tall and hairy humanlike figure with a dog nose, horns, an eye on each side of the head and six arms in total; he can stretch those arms almost infinitely; his skin may be either orange or lime green. Though he is quite beastly, Smorgasbord is nonetheless sentient (as demonstrated by the fact that he wears clothes, primitive jewelry and, most notably, a bowler hat) and can actually talk, though he rarely does. Smorgasbord is invulnerable to most mundane attacks, but the explosion of a stick of dynamite is nonetheless too much for him to handle; when faced with one, he will disappear and will only be back if one summons him all over again. He was summoned on Halloween in 1952 by Witch Hazel to scare Donald Duck into giving away candy to trick-or- treaters Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck. Smorgasbord first appeared in November 1952 in Carl Barks's comic-book version of Trick or Treat, although he was only featured in cut pages that were not restored to the story until 1978. RobotsLittle Helper= The companion of Gyro Gearloose Little Helper, or simply Helper, debuted in the story \\"The Cat Box\\" in Uncle Scrooge #15 (September 1956), created by Carl Barks. Helper is a small, humanoid robot (about 20 cm tall), constructed from pieces of metal and a lightbulb, which serves as his head. He acts as the assistant to the inventor Gyro Gearloose. In the Donald Duck comics, he is often shown as an inventor himself, sometimes copying Gyro's inventions. Little Helper never speaks, but occasionally uses thought bubbles. He is capable of buzzing, which he mostly uses to attract Gyro's attention. It is not clear whether Gyro can actually understand Helper's buzzing or whether he just acknowledges that Helper has something to show for him. Little Helper enjoys chasing mice and helping Gyro clean up the unusual consequences of his inventions. Helper's origin is given in the story \\"Gyro's First Invention\\" (written and drawn by Don Rosa), which appears in Uncle Scrooge #324 (December 2003) as part of Gyro's 50th anniversary. In this retelling, Gyro accidentally passed on some of his intelligence to Donald Duck's desk lamp. Gyro added small metal arms and legs to the lamp, so that it could move about as a small robot. Little Helper lived up to his name, helping his creator with his inventions. In the Italian comics, his name is Edi, in reference to Thomas Edison. In many of Barks' original scripts and notes, he is sometimes named Little Bulbhead,http://www.cbarks.dk/theunknownscripta.htm a name that was never given in the comics. Little Helper appears alongside Gyro in the animated series DuckTales. He is called Little Bulb in the series, a name seemingly adapted from Barks' notes, which is compatible with the Brazilian name for the character ‚Äî Lampadinha ‚Äî informal diminutive of L√¢mpada (lamp), in Portuguese. Also in Dutch, he is called \\"Lampje\\" (little lamp) and Filament in French. He also appears by the same name in the reboot series, in which he is depicted as a fairly hostile robot with a tendency towards violence. Historical figures In several Don Rosa stories, Scrooge McDuck encountered historical people. The most notable of these encounters was with U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt and Scrooge would meet each other at least three times: in the Dakotas in 1883, in Duckburg in 1902, and in Panama in 1906. Rosa is famous for his historical accuracy: he checks historical records to make sure that the figures he writes about could have plausibly taken part in those adventures. (This also extends to scientific accuracy for the most part.) Other historical people who met Scrooge: * Elias L√∂nnrot, in Glasgow in 1877. * Jesse James, several times in the late 19th century. * Murdo McKenzie, in Montana from 1882 to 1884. * Sultan Mangkunagara V of Djokja, in Batavia in 1883. : (Which was actually an error since the ruler of Djokja at the time was Sultan Hamengkubuwono VII. The error was derived from the mistake on Don Rosa's source, an 1890s traveling story titled On The Subject of Java) * Sultan Pakubuwana IX of Solo, in Batavia in 1883. * Marcus Daly, in Butte, Montana in 1884. * Jakob Waltz in Pizen Bluff in 1890. * Geronimo, in Arizona in 1890. * Buffalo Bill, in Arizona in 1890. * Annie Oakley, in Arizona in 1890. * P. T. Barnum, in Arizona in 1890. * The Dalton Brothers, in Arizona in 1890. * Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld, at the Chicago Universal Exposition in 1892 (or 1893). * Wyatt Earp, in Skagway in 1896 and one year later in White Agony Creek. * Bat Masterson, in White Agony Creek in 1897. * Judge Roy Bean, in White Agony Creek in 1897. * Butch Cassidy, in White Agony Creek in 1897. * The Sundance Kid, in White Agony Creek in 1897. * Sam Steele, in Dawson City in 1898. * Jack London, in Dawson City in 1898. * Edith Roosevelt, in Panama in 1906. * John F. Stevens, in Panama in 1906. * Robert Peary, close to the North Pole in 1909. * Matthew Henson, near the North Pole in 1909. * Nicholas II of Russia, in the Winter Palace in 1910. * John Jacob Astor IV, on the RMS Titanic in 1912 * Sitting Bull, he was called \\"Standing Bull\\" until he lost a fight against Scrooge. Furthermore, Don Rosa often hides images of himself, his friends or Carl Barks in his stories.

Amacrine cells are interneurons in the retina. They are named from the Greek roots a‚Äì (\\"non\\"), makr‚Äì (\\"long\\") and in‚Äì (\\"fiber\\"), because of their short neuritic processes. Amacrine cells are inhibitory neurons, and they project their dendritic arbors onto the inner plexiform layer (IPL), they interact with retinal ganglion cells and/or bipolar cells. Structure Amacrine cells operate at inner plexiform layer (IPL), the second synaptic retinal layer where bipolar cells and retinal ganglion cells form synapses. There are at least 33 different subtypes of amacrine cells based just on their dendrite morphology and stratification. Like horizontal cells, amacrine cells work laterally, but whereas horizontal cells are connected to the output of rod and cone cells, amacrine cells affect the output from bipolar cells, and are often more specialized. Each type of amacrine cell releases one or several neurotransmitters where it connects with other cells. They are often classified by the width of their field of connection, which layer(s) of the stratum in the IPL they are in, and by neurotransmitter type. Most are inhibitory using either gamma-Aminobutyric acid or glycine as neurotransmitters. =Types= As mentioned above, there are several different ways to divide the many different types of amacrine cells into subtypes. GABAergic, glycinergic, or neither: Amacrine cells can be either GABAergic, glycinergic or neither depending on what inhibitory neurotransmitter they express (GABA, glycine, or neither). GABAergic amacrine cells are usually wide field amacrine cells and are found in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL). One type of GABAergic amacrine cell that is fairly well studied is the starburst amacrine cell. These amacrine cells are usually characterised by their expression of choline acetyltransferase, or ChAT and are known to play a role in direction selectivity and detection of directional motion. Acetylcholine is also released from these amacrine cells, but its function is not completely understood. Another subtype of GABAergic amacrine cells are those that are dopaminergic. These are all TH expressing and these amacrine cells modulate light adaption and circadian rhythm. These are widely spreading amacrine cells, and they diffusely release dopamine, while still releasing GABA and carrying out all normal synaptic release. Many other divisions of GABAergic amacrine cells have been noted, but those listed above are some of the most extensively researched and discussed. Glycinergic amacrine cells aren't as extensively characterized as GABAergic amacrine cells. All glycinergic amacrine cells though, are marked by the glycine transporter GlyT1. One very well characterized glycinergic amacrine cell is the AII amacrine cells. These cells are present in the INL. One importance function of the AII amacrine cells is that they capture cellular input from rod bipolar cells and redistribute it to cone bipolar cells using the synaptic endings of cone bipolar cells as adaptors Around 15% of amacrine cells are neither GABAergic or glycinergic. These amacrine cells are sometimes known as nGnG amacrine cells, and it is thought that transcription factors that act on progenitors decide the fate of amacrine cells. One transcription factor that was found to be selectively expressed in nGnG amacrine cells is Neurod6 Length of dendritic arbors: Based on length, spread of dendritic arbors, amacrine cells can be categorized as narrow field amacrine cells (around 70 micrometers in diameter), medium field amacrine cells (around 170 micrometers in diameter) and wide field amacrine cells (around 350 micrometers in diameter). These different lengths lend to different specific functions that the amacrine cells can accomplish. Narrow field amacrine cells allow vertical communication among different retinal levels. They also aid in creating functional subunits in the receptive field of ganglion cells. These narrow field amacrine cells and their overlap in these subunits can allow certain ganglion cells to detect small amounts of movement of a very small spot in a field of vision. One type of narrow field cells that does this is the starburst amacrine cell. Medium field amacrine cells also contribute to vertical communication in the cells of the retina, but much of their overall function is still unknown. Due to the fact that their dendritic arbor size is pretty similar to that of ganglion cells, they could blur the edge of the ganglion cell visual field. Similarly, wide field amacrine cells are hard to research and even discover because they span the entire retina so there aren't many of them. In light of their size though, one of their main functions is lateral communication within a layer, though some also communicate vertically among layers. =Organization= Amacrine cells and other retinal interneuron cells are less likely to be near neighbours of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in 'exclusion zones' that separate them. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements. MEGF10 and MEGF11 transmembrane proteins have critical roles in the formation of the mosaics by starburst amacrine cells and horizontal cells in mice. Function In many cases, the subtype of the amacrine cell speaks to its function (form leads to function), but some specific functions of the retinal amacrine cells can be outlined. * Intercept retinal ganglion cells and/ or bipolar cells in the IPL * Create functional subunits within the receptive fields of many ganglion cells *Contribute to vertical communication within the retinal layers *Carry out paracrine functions such as release of dopamine and acetylcholine *Through their connections with other retinal cells at synapses and release of neurotransmitters, contribute to the detection of directional motion, modulate light adaption and circadian rhythm, and control high sensitivity in scotopic vision through connections with rod and cone bipolar cells There is still much to be discovered about all of the different functions of all of the different amacrine cells. Amacrine cells with extensive dendritic trees are thought to contribute to inhibitory surrounds by feedback at both the bipolar cell and ganglion cell levels. In this role they are considered to supplement the action of the horizontal cells. Other forms of amacrine cell are likely to play modulatory roles, allowing adjustment of sensitivity for photopic and scotopic vision. The AII amacrine cell is a mediator of signals from rod cells under scotopic conditions.

Gabibbo's main role has been in the programs Paperissima and Striscia la notizia, but he has appeared in several other Canale 5 programs. He is normally a jovial character known for his ability to make wisecracks and his overall humble demeanor. He speaks Italian with a Genoese accent, occasionally using Italianized Genoese words. In fact the word Gabibbo or Gabibbu belongs to the Genoese language and it is used to indicate, in an ironic-depreciative way, an immigrant from southern or even central Italy (it may originate from the Arab epithet habib). Western Kentucky Hilltoppers lawsuit Gabibbo has also earned negative press surrounding a lawsuit brought by Western Kentucky University who claim that Gabibbo is an exact copy of their mascot, Big Red. Western Kentucky claims it has a case because in an interview with Novella 2000, Ricci states that he created Gabibbo after seeing Western Kentucky's mascot, further adding that Gabibbo is in fact, \\"(an imported) Big Red\\". Ricci claims he was joking in that interview, saying that he made the remark after Novella pointed out the similarities between Big Red and Gabibbo. He goes on to say that there are \\"100 different mascots who look like Gabibbo\\", not just Big Red, adding that the Sesame Street mascots Cookie Monster and Elmo also look like Gabibbo. However, Gabibbo's head is almost an exact copy of Big Red's (a fact repeated by The New York Times' business section, who quip that Gabibbo is simply a \\"better dressed\\" version of Big Red) and that Big Red debuted in 1979, almost eleven years prior to Gabibbo.

Largely involved with local artists, the studio is best known for recording portions of Bob Dylan's Blood on the Tracks in 1974 and Cat Stevens' Izitso in 1977, as well as demo tapes for Prince's first album For You in 1977. In 1978, Sound 80 made the first digital audio recording to win a Grammy Award‚ÄîThe Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra's recording of Aaron Copland's \\"Appalachian Spring\\" and \\"Short Symphony,\\" and Charles Ives' \\"Symphony No. 3.\\"https://www.facebook.com/thespco/posts/10151549157276051?_fb_noscript=1 In 2020, Sound 80 was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Jung and Pilhofer had previously worked at the Kay Bank Studios in Minneapolis, where artists such as Dave Dudley and The Trashmen had recorded. The Sound 80 name came from advertising man Brad Morrison, who had previously named Hormel's Cure 81 ham product (supposedly while drinking Vat 69 Scotch). \\"The number didn't mean a thing,\\" Pilhofer later explained. \\"Eighty-one was already taken [by Hormel]. Eighty just sounded right and it looked good.\\" 3M, based in neighboring Saint Paul, Minnesota, brought in a prototype digital recording system in the late Spring of 1978. Nicknamed \\"Herbie\\" after Herb Pilhofer, the system was used for two recordings by the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and one for jazz group Flim and the BB's. One of the SPCO albums won the Grammy Award for Best Chamber Orchestra Recording in 1979. Being a prototype, it was a very bulky and finicky system. For example, it used wire wrap boards and few, if any, soldered connections. When it worked, the system had a number of good qualities. However, there was no editing ability for digital media at the time, so even minor flaws would require the whole track to be re-recorded. Tom Jung left the company to work in New York City, but created a mobile recording unit known as Road 80, which was rented to Sound 80 studios on occasion. Jung later created the company DMP Digital Music Products, which also pushed the envelope of later digital audio technology (the company recorded the first multi-channel Super Audio CD). In the mid 1980s the building became the home to AVC Systems, one of the largest pro audio contractors in the midwest. The basement, including the live echo chamber, was converted into a staging area for system fabrication. The main studio was converted to a showroom and office facilities. The smaller studio was rented by \\"Roger Dodger Music\\", a Minneapolis based keyboard/synthesizer dealer. Orfield Labs The building in 2020 as Orfield Laboratories The Sound 80 building was sold around 1990, but the original recording studio still exists and is now home to Orfield Labs who operate an Eckel Industries- designed anechoic chamber. At ‚àí13 dB, it is listed as \\"the quietest place on Earth\\" by the Guinness Book of World Records. Sound 80 was listed in Guinness again in 2006 as the \\"Oldest Digital Recording Studio in the World\\". Sound 80 today Sound 80 continues today under the ownership of Jan Erickson. Erickson started with the company in 1969 and purchased the company in 1984. The business moved to the IDS Tower and after that to the Campbell Mithun Tower in Minneapolis where it resides today. It continues to do high quality audio recording specializing in commercial recording and small ensembles.

It stars Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra in the lead roles while Naseeruddin Shah, Rekha, Manini Mishra, Archana Puran Singh and Sharat Saxena feature in supporting roles. It is the second installment in the Krrish franchise, being the sequel to Koi... Mil Gaya, and relates the story of Krishna, the son of the previous film's protagonists, who inherits his father's superhuman abilities. After falling in love with Priya, he follows her to Singapore, where he takes on the persona of \\"Krrish\\" to keep his identity secret while saving children from a burning circus. From that moment on he is regarded as a superhero, and must later thwart the plans of the evil Dr. Arya, who has a connection to Krishna's father, Rohit, the protagonist of the previous film. Krrish was conceived to be a film of global significance and a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with those from Hollywood. To that end, the effects team was aided by Hollywood's Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, and the stunts were choreographed by Chinese martial arts film expert Tony Ching. The music was composed by Rajesh Roshan, with the background score by Salim-Sulaiman. Filming was done to a large extent in Singapore as well as India. The film was released worldwide on 23 June 2006 at a budget of 40 crore and on 1000 prints, both near-record amounts for an Indian film at the time. Krrish received mixed reviews from critics in India, but got a record opening week at the box office. A blockbuster, Krrish grossed a worldwide total of 126 crore, becoming the third highest-grossing Indian film of 2006. Krrish received 8 nominations at the 52nd Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor for Roshan and Best Supporting Actress for Rekha, and won 3, including Best Special Effects. At the 2007 IIFA Awards, the film received 9 nominations and won 3, including Best Actor for Roshan. It also won the National Film Award for Best Special Effects. The third film in the series, Krrish 3 was released in 2013.  Plot  Five-year-old Krishna Mehra, son of the late scientist Rohit Mehra, undergoes an intelligence quotient test by a professor, who suspects that he has superpowers, due to Krishna answering all the questions flawlessly. His grandmother Sonia takes the young Krishna to a remote mountain village to conceal his unique abilities. Years later, Krishna meets vacationing friends Priya and Honey when Krishna's friend Bahadur takes the girls' camping crew near his home to camp. Krishna saves Priya from a hang glider accident and falls in love with her when spending time with her. After returning home to Singapore, Priya and Honey are fired by their boss for taking a non-permitted extension of 5-days in their vacation. To keep their jobs, Honey suggests her boss making a television program about Krishna. Aware of Krishna's love towards her, Priya calls him to join her in Singapore to ask her mother permission to marry her. Sonia objects to this, saying that people will want to exploit his abilities. She then explains the events of the previous film, and that Rohit was hired by scientist Siddhant Arya to design a computer that could see the future to prevent wars and help prepare against natural disasters. Rohit later discovered that the purpose of the computer was not for good, so he destroyed it. Rohit reportedly died in a laboratory accident that night, with Krishna's mother, Nisha dying of trauma shortly thereafter. Krishna promises Sonia that he will never reveal his powers, so she permits him to go. In Singapore, during the program's production, Krishna keeps his word and reveals nothing exceptional about himself; Honey and Priya are fired again. Krishna meets circus performer Kristian Li, who attempts to raise funds to pay for his young sister's leg surgery. He invites Krishna and Priya to his circus, where a fire breaks out during the performance. Several children remain trapped in the blaze. To save the children without revealing his abilities, Krishna dons a broken black mask and puts his jacket on inside- out, creating the persona of \\"Krrish\\". Later, when Kristian sees Krrish fighting some goons and removing his mask, he discovers his friend Krishna is Krrish. As Krrish is being offered a reward for his deeds, Krishna asks Kristian to assume the identity, so that he can pay for his sister's surgery. Meanwhile, Priya discovers that Krishna is Krrish upon seeing the footage from her video camera. She and Honey decide to release the footage on TV to make Krishna a star. Krishna arrives and overhears them talking about how Priya had lied to him, and how they will reveal his identity. Just before Priya confesses to Honey that she has genuinely fallen in love with Krishna, he leaves, dejected. After being confronted by Krishna at his apartment they talked what she said, Priya realises her mistake and stops her boss from revealing Krrish's identity. She then meets Vikram Sinha, who has been searching for Krishna for years. He tells them that Rohit is still alive; after completing the computer, he and Rohit tested it and saw Siddhant holding Rohit at gunpoint. Rohit understood that Siddhant was going to kill him and then use the computer for his own selfish needs. He was able to destroy it, before being taken prisoner by Siddhant. In the present, Siddhant has rebuilt the computer after many years. He uses it to reveal his future and sees Krrish killing him. Siddhant then kills Kristian, thinking that he is Krrish. Krishna later follows Siddhant to his island lair. When Siddhant looks into the future again, he sees the same thing and is shocked to see Krrish still alive and on his island. When Krrish enters the compound, there is a vicious fight with Siddhant's thugs. Krrish eventually defeats them and saves Priya and Rohit. However, Vikram is shot dead by Siddhant. Krrish eventually wounds Siddhant fatally. Before Siddhant dies, Krrish reveals himself as Krishna. After revealing to Rohit that he is his son, Krishna takes Priya and his father back to India, reuniting him with Sonia. Rohit then uses his father's special computer to contact his alien friend Jadoo, whose spaceship is later seen from a distance.

Mil Gaya (2003). They announced that actors Hrithik Roshan and Rekha would return for the sequel, but that Preity Zinta would be replaced by Priyanka Chopra. Chopra also confirmed the same, adding, \\"The story will start where Koi... Mil Gaya ended.\\" Rakesh Roshan hoped that the film would be remembered as the first to prove that the Indian film industry is equal to Hollywood. He decided to push the story forward by focusing on the son of the previous films's protagonist, who would inherit his father's special abilities. The story combined elements of Indian mythology (the main character's name Krishna alludes to the Hindu Lord Krishna), Chinese martial arts and Hollywood films to set itself up as a film of global significance. Rakesh Roshan wanted Krrish to be a trendsetter in Indian cinema, with visual effects on par with Hollywood films. He hired Hollywood special effects experts Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma, who had both previously worked on such films as Independence Day, Godzilla and Sky Captain, to help create the visual effects for the film. Roshan also hired Hong Kong action director Tony Ching after admiring his work in Hero. Before production began, Hrithik Roshan went to China to train with Ching for the cable work that would be needed to make his character \\"fly\\". A story board of the film was prepared and sent to Ching to help him develop the action sequences. Additional production credits include: Farah Khan ‚Äì choreographer, Samir Chanda and Sham Kaushal ‚Äì art directors, Baylon Fonesca and Nakul Kamte ‚Äì sound, Nahush Pise ‚Äì makeup artist, Sham Kaushal ‚Äì assistant action director. =Filming= Krrish was the first Indian film to be shot in Singapore under the Singapore Tourism Board's Film-in-Singapore subsidy scheme, and over 60% of the film was shot there. Shooting was accomplished on location over a span of 2 months, from September to November 2005. Locations featured included the Singapore Zoo, the Gateway building, and the Singapore National Library. Another major filming location was Robinson Road, where heavy rains caused production delays. The Singapore police were on location to block roads and protect the filming equipment, such as when the film's action scenes required two 250-foot high industrial cranes. Author Audrey Yue noted that the film shoot benefited Singapore by leading to domestic and Indian film-induced tourism. Filming also took place in Manali and Film City in Mumbai. During filming of a flying stunt, one of the wires that was tied to Hrithik Roshan broke, causing him to fall 50 feet, though he landed safely on a shop's canopy. Hrithik described the incident as a \\"freak accident\\", stating, \\"I was skydiving to my death till I fell on a six-feet-long canopy of a shop that was out because of the slight drizzle. The canopy had iron rods. But I missed those rods too. What do I say? I guess the right word to describe the situation would be jadoo (magic).\\" Roshan also suffered other injuries during the film's production. He tore the hamstring in his right leg during a circus scene, singed his hair while running through fire in another action scene, and broke his thumb and toe during strenuous training for the wirework. Indian firm Prasad EFX assigned a team of more than 100 VFX specialists to work with Marc Kolbe and Craig Mumma to create the visual effects for the film. Included were sophisticated 3D modelling and computer animation, including whole body scans, 3D replicas of vehicles, fire sequences, complicated wire removals and compositing work. They prepared over 1,200 VFX shots, accounting for approximately 90 minutes of screen time. Describing the effects, Rakesh Roshan stated, \\"If you liked the visual effects in Koi... Mil Gaya, you will find them far better in Krrish. I do not think audiences have seen anything like this in Hindi films.\\"Subhash K. Jha, Indo-Asian News Service, Mumbai, 18 June 2006 Soundtrack The film's soundtrack, composed by Rajesh Roshan, was released on 30 April 2006 by T-Series. Lyricists included Ibraheem Ashk, Nasir Faraaz, and Vijay Akela. Salim-Sulaiman provided the background score. It became the seventh best-selling Bollywood soundtrack of the year. Critical reviews of the soundtrack were generally favourable, though some in the media called it a disappointment. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album a rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that it was \\"another good outing for Bollywood music lovers.\\" He especially praised the songs \\"Chori Chori\\", \\"Koi Tumsa Nahi\\" and \\"Pyaar Ki Ek Kahaani.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave a favourable review for the soundtrack's \\"catchy\\" songs. However, she felt that while the songs meshed with the film, \\"none of them bear the staying power of Rajesh Roshan's earlier soundtracks.\\" Shruti Bhasin of Planet Bollywood enjoyed the original songs, giving 7.5 out of 10 stars, but was disappointed with the remixes. Dr. Mandar V. Bichu of Gulf News said that it did not live up to the pre-release expectations. Release The final budget of Krrish came to 40 crore, which at that time was considered a big-budget film by Bollywood standards. The film was released on 23 June 2006 with 1,000 prints, and in 5 languages simultaneously. It was the first Indian film to receive payments in advance for product placement, music, and international distribution rights. There was also related merchandise offered for sale prior to the film's release to maximize profits. These included action figures, masks and other toys. The film's DVD was released in Region 1 on 18 August 2006, by Adlabs. On 21 August 2006, it was released for all regions by Filmkraft. Adlabs also released a Blu-ray version. After the success of Krrish, Rakesh Roshan announced that he would be making a sequel, tentatively titled Krrish 3. He confirmed that Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra would reprise their roles, and that the antagonists would be played by Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. =Critical ReceptionIndia Krrish received mixed reviews from critics in India. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama believed that the film surpassed expectations, but felt that there were issues with pacing in first hour. Overall, he deemed Krrish to be \\"a terrifically exciting and compelling experience\\", and awarded the film 4 of 5 stars. Nikhat Kazmi noted in The Times of India that while the superhero and action sequences were appealing, there were not enough of them. He was also not excited by the romantic parts, comparing them to a sightseeing tour, first in India and then in Singapore. He said that overall, this film lacks the fun of its predecessor. On the other hand, Raja Sen said that Krrish was infinitely better than KMG, though ultimately it was all about Hrithik Roshan. Sen and Sukanya Verma, writing for Rediff, both gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, and both said that it was a good film for children. Sen summarised \\"So, is it a good superhero movie? No, but it's well-intentioned. It's a full-on kiddie movie, and while a lot of us might be scornful of Krrish, it's heartening to see fantasy officially entering mainstream Bollywood.\\" Verma agreed with other critics that it took too long for the action to get started, and said that a lot of attention was spent showing off Roshan's muscles. He summarised, \\"Krrish neither has the sleek aura nor the deep-rooted ideology of superheroes. What it does have is a super spirited performance from Hrithik Roshan, which is likely to appeal to children. And that's worth a three-star cheer.\\" Saibal Chatterjee wrote in the Hindustan Times that Krrish is a hackneyed, formulaic masala film, with special effects added on top, and hoped that this would not be the future of Bollywood. Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN condemned the screenplay and thought that the only thing that made the film watchable was the acting of Hrithik Roshan. He gave the film only 2 out of 5 stars, saying \\"Krrish is only an average film that could have been so much better if the makers had concentrated as hard on its story as they did on its action and stunts.\\" Overseas Overseas reviews were positive. The Rotten Tomatoes aggregate rating is 88% \\"Fresh\\", based on 8 reviews, with an average rating of 7 out of 10. Richard James Havis of The Hollywood Reporter stated, \\"This Bollywood epic crunches together romance, comedy, extraterrestrials, martial arts, dancing and action to tell an entertaining story about a reluctant Indian superhero\\" but said it may be \\"far too crazed for foreign viewers\\". David Chute of LA Weekly deemed it a \\"hearty pulp cinema that really sticks to your ribs\\". Likewise, Laura Kern of The New York Times said it was a blend of carefree romance, show-stopping action and sci-fi. Ronnie Scheib of Variety said that it was an \\"enjoyable, daffily improbable escapist romp\\". He praised the action sequences as ingeniously choreographed, but very family-friendly. Though Jaspreet Pandohar of BBC was critical of the script for being \\"low on originality\\", he praised Hrithik Roshan's performance and the action scenes. Dr. P.V. Vaidyanathan, in a review for BBC Shropshire, said that the film's excellent special effects were as good as the best from Hollywood, praised Hrithik's acting, but called the music mundane. =Box office= Krrish had a good opening week, and tickets were reportedly selling for many times the original cost at some locations. Total gross collections were an Indian record of 41.6 crore (29.7 crore nett) for its opening week. Krrish became the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2006, earning over 69 crore nett in India alone, and was classified as a \\"Blockbuster\\" by Box Office India. It also grossed 31.68 crore in the overseas market, where it was declared a \\"hit\\". The final worldwide total gross was 126 crore. One week after Krrish was released, another superhero film, Superman Returns was released in India. Rakesh Roshan stated, \\"I was a little skeptical that Superman might hurt me, but fortunately it didn't.\\" In fact, Krrish fared better at the box office in India than Superman Returns did. =Accolades= Krrish was one of India's possible nominations for the 2007 Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, but the country ultimately chose Rang De Basanti as its pick. Despite this, Krrish won numerous awards, including 3 Filmfare Awards‚ÄîBest Special Effects, Best Action and Best Background Score‚Äîand was nominated for Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Villain at the 52nd Filmfare Awards. At the 2007 IIFA Awards, Krrish won Best Actor, Best Action, and Best Special Effects. Rakesh Roshan won the Creative Person of the Year title at the same ceremony. Additionally, the film was nominated in the following categories at the ceremony: Best Director, Best Music and Best Story. Hrithik Roshan won other acting awards that year, including the Star Screen Award Best Actor, Zee Cine Award for Best Actor ‚Äì Male, BFJA ‚Äì Best Actor Award (Hindi) and GIFA Best Actor. The film's special effects won the National Film Award for Best Special Effects. The film also took Best Picture honours at the Matri Shree Media Awards. In a showing of the film's popularity with children, Krrish swept the major film categories at the Pogo Amazing Kids Awards, which are voted on by children across India. Winners were: Hrithik Roshan (Most Amazing Actor ‚Äî Male), Priyanka Chopra (Most Amazing Actor ‚Äî Female), Krrish (Most Amazing Film), Special Effects in Krrish (Most Amazing Moment in a film).

They provide an execution model that uses a few additional instructions in a conventional processor to break code down into fragments that execute simultaneously. Dependencies are managed by making registers in the microprocessors executing the code synchronising, so one microthread will wait for another to produce data. This is a form of dataflow. This model can be applied to an existing instruction set architecture incrementally by providing just five new instructions to implement concurrency controls. A set of microthreads is a static partition of a basic block into concurrently executing fragments, which execute on a single processor and share a microcontext. An iterator over a set provides a dynamic and parametric family of microthreads. Iterators capture loop concurrency and can be scheduled to different processors. An iterator over a set is created dynamically and is called a family of microthreads. This is the mechanism that allows the model to generate concurrency, which can be run on multiple processors or functional units.

Belk stores and Belk.com offer apparel, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings and wedding registry. History The first Belk, established as New York Racket, in 1902. Belk was founded in 1888 by William Henry Belk in Monroe, North Carolina, outside Charlotte. The store was first called \\"New York Racket\\" and then \\"Belk Brothers\\", after Belk made his brother, physician Dr. John Belk, his partner. Belk bought in volume to pass savings on and sold at fixed prices, then a relatively unusual practice. By 1909, the company had moved its headquarters to Charlotte and built a huge flagship store on Trade and Tryon Streets in downtown Charlotte, which would remain the company's headquarters until it was closed in 1988 to make way for the construction of what is now Bank of America Corporate Center. The business grew steadily, relying on \\"bargain sales\\" and advertising to grow the business and increase its influence throughout the South. Beginning in 1921 with the Leggett Bros. stores of South Boston, Virginia, the Belk company grew by investing in various partnerships with local merchandisers in nearby markets. Belk's growth out of the Southeast was pushed by Earl Jones Sr and the Belk-Jones brand that opened the first Belk west of the Mississippi in 1947. The Jones family and the Belk-Jones brand continued to grow Belk's westward expansion. This complex story is chronicled in a book published by Belk ‚Äì Belk, Inc.: The Company and the Family That Built It ‚Äì about the evolution of the company. This structure allowed Belk to expand quickly and permitted local variation, but resulted in a diluted brand identity since most stores were co-branded. By the 1990s, the system had become increasingly untenable: stores were held by over 350 separate legal entities, Belk family members disagreed about whether to maintain or sweep away the structure, and some local partners threatened stability by selling their stakes. For example, the heirs of John G. Parks, majority owners of the Parks-Belk chain, sold their interests to Proffitt's, a competitor. The Belks quickly sold their stake as well, although Belk would later purchase the stores back as part of its later acquisition of the entire Proffitt's chain. When Proffitt's made an offer for the Leggett family's stake, which included 42 stores comprising about 20 percent of Belk's revenue, John and Tom Belk were forced to respond by forming a new company in 1996 that bought the Leggetts out. This move accelerated the slow trend of consolidating the store's ownership under the Belks. Belk Bros. store in Charlotte, North Carolina around 1910. In 1998, the company formed a new entity (Belk, Inc.) that merged the 112 remaining Belk companies, swapping the existing partners' local interests for shares in the combined entity; for example, the Hudson family in Raleigh received almost 5% of the shares. The same year, Belk made a deal to acquire seven Dillard's locations in exchange for nine of theirs so that each could build on regional strengths. Slowly, Belk eliminated the dual brands, completing the process with a chain-wide Belk rebranding in the fall of 2010. On July 5, 2005, Belk completed the purchase of 47 Proffitt's and McRae's department stores from Saks Incorporated, primarily in Tennessee and Mississippi. Belk converted the 39 Proffitt's and McRae's stores to the Belk nameplate on March 8, 2006. Just over a year later, Belk purchased 38 Parisian department stores from Saks on October 2, 2006. Although most Parisian stores were converted to the Belk nameplate since September 12, 2007, some duplicate Parisian stores were closed, as at The Mall at Barnes Crossing in Tupelo, Mississippi, Richland Mall (then known as Midtown at Forest Acres), Columbiana Centre in Columbia, South Carolina, and Citadel Mall in Charleston, South Carolina. Four Parisian stores in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, plus a store under construction at the time in Michigan, were sold by Belk to The Bon-Ton Stores, Inc. Integrating the larger, more upscale Parisian stores proved a challenge for Belk, and spurred the creation of the company's flagship strategy. One of the earliest prototype 1960s-era stores to feature the trademark Belk arches, Southgate Mall, Elizabeth City, NC. During the fourth quarter of 2005, Belk completed the sale of its private-label credit card division, Belk National Bank, to GE MoneyBank. Consumers were issued new Belk credit cards replacing the old ones issued by BNB. All new Belk cards are now issued by GE MoneyBank, now known as Synchrony Bank. Former Belk logo used from 1967 to 2010. The \\"All for you!\\" slogan was used from the late 1990s onward. On October 3, 2010, the News & Observer reported that Belk planned to update its logo. On October 12 at SouthPark Mall, Belk introduced the new logo, its first since 1967. The chain embarked on a $70 million marketing campaign that replaced the old slogan \\"All for You!\\" with a new slogan, \\"Modern. Southern. Style.\\" Sixty stores got new signs in the first phase, with the remainder getting new signs throughout 2011. Advertisements for Belk & Co. jewelry continue to use a variation of the old logo. On April 3, 2015, news reports revealed that Belk was exploring \\"strategic alternatives,\\" including a possible sale of the company. On August 24, 2015, Belk announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by New York-based private equity firm Sycamore Partners. The acquisition was completed on December 10, 2015. On June 29, 2016, Belk announced that effective as of July 5, Lisa Harper, CEO of Hot Topic (which is another Sycamore Partners-owned company), would replace Tim Belk as CEO of Belk. This would be the first time since the founding of the company that a non-Belk family member would head the company. Belk at the Mall of Georgia in Buford, Georgia Company today Belk store at Haywood Mall in Greenville, South Carolina The chain operates 293 stores in 16 states, generating $4 billion in sales in 2014. The state of North Carolina leads in the number of Belk stores with 65 stores followed by Georgia and South Carolina with 45 and 35 stores respectively. Its typical store covers 100,000 to 180,000 square feet. 50% of its stores are in regional malls, another 40% in open-air community or retail parks, and 10% in open-air lifestyle centers. Even as Belk has made its recent acquisitions, the chain has operated limited electronic commerce on its website, and those websites acquired and redirected to Belk.com. Home furnishings such as bedding, small kitchen appliances, crystal, dinnerware, and china have been offered for several years to online shoppers as a part of the chain's online bridal and gift registry. The chain revamped its website and registry on September 15, 2008. Celebrity-branded product lines are another pursuit, including a partnership with actress Kristin Davis for a ladies apparel and accessories collection which debuted in fall 2008 in 125 store locations and online. However, that product line was discontinued in late 2009. In December 2010, Belk announced that it would become the title sponsor for the former Meineke Car Care Bowl (played in Charlotte), renamed as the Belk Bowl beginning in 2011. The sponsorship would continue for three years. On July 18, 2013, Belk announced a six-year extension of the bowl partnership with the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), beginning in 2014. Under the agreement, the bowl featured teams from the ACC and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). On November 20, 2019, Belk announced that it would no longer be the title sponsor for the bowl game following the 2019 playing. Overall, Belk was the title sponsor for nine editions of the bowl (2011‚Äì2019). In July 2020, it was announced that Sycamore Partners had made a $1.75B offer to acquire department store chain and competitor JCPenney out of bankruptcy, and would rebrand 250 JCPenney stores to the Belk name, to help the chain compete directly with Macy's. The remaining JCPenney stores will be liquidated. Flagship locations A flagship store at Bridge Street Town Centre in Huntsville, Alabama The chain has multiple \\"flagship\\" locations‚Äîlarger locations in urban and metropolitan centers, and a wider array of merchandise and services including in-store salons.

It was first published in 1997. Synopsis The almanack is presented as though it were written by Gervase Brightkin, a red squirrel. There are entries for all the days of the year, and every major event in the main novels is given a date. Also, much of the folk lore and elaborate traditions of the mice, bats, squirrels and rats is recorded in the almanack. Throughout the almanack, Gervase writes of his stay in Greenwich Park during the tenth year of Audrey Scuttle's reign as Starwife. He also travels to Fennywolde and Holeborn to ask William 'Twit' Scuttle and Arthur Brown to tell their stories. While in Fennywolde, Gervase encounters Alison Sedge, the field mouse who was jealous of Audrey in The Crystal Prison. Seemingly driven mad because of the death of her love, Jenkin Nettle, she solemnly warns that Audrey will not be the Starwife for much longer and will know great loss. At the end of the year, the Great Oak (in which the rat god Hobb was imprisoned by Ysabelle in The Oaken Throne) falls down because of heavy winds, and many of the grey squirrels in the park begin to whisper that it was Audrey's fault because she is not a squirrel but merely a mouse. When the black squirrels Morella and her father Modequai arrive in Greenwich, they and the grey squirrels plot against Audrey, and finally storm into her chamber and oust her from office. Then they give the silver acorn to Morella and she takes the title of Starwife. Strangely enough, she bears a resemblance to Alison Sedge. The almanack ends on this ominous note, opening up the possibility of a new Deptford Mice novel.

The minister for health and ambulance services has overall responsibility for the department, while the director-general and chief health officer manage day-to-day operational and clinical activities. Queensland Health includes the department proper, 16 local Hospital and Health Services throughout Queensland, and a range of related foundations and authorities. The department employs over 90,000 staff and has an annual operating budget of 19.23 billion in 201920. On 1 January 1946, Queensland became the first state in Australia to introduce free universal public hospital treatment, a policy later adopted by other jurisdictions. Created in 1975, Medicare gives Australian citizens and permanent residents access to low or no cost health services, including doctors, medications (through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme), mental health practitioners, in both the public and private health systems. Australia has reciprocal health care agreements with 11 other nations, covering the cost of medically necessary care when Australians visit certain countries and visitors from these countries visit Australia. History2005 restructure= Queensland Health was restructured toward the end of 2005 from 38 \\"health districts\\" to 20. There were a number consolidations particularly in the urban areas with the formation of the \\"Northside\\" and \\"Southside\\" Districts. Northside District included three major hospital facilities including The Prince Charles Hospital, Redcliffe and Caboolture Hospitals while Southside brought the Logan, Redlands, Beaudesert and Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospitals together. Due to their size and areas they covered, the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital (RBWH) on the Northside, and the Princess Alexandra Hospital or regional centre on the Southside remained independent entities or Districts in their own right. Toowoomba Hospital, 2008 From September 2008 the 20 health service districts were further reduced to 15. According to a Queensland Health media release, nine districts remain unchanged. They are: Central Queensland, Townsville, Mackay, Cairns, Torres Strait, Cape York, Mount Isa, Central West and South West Districts. Six new districts were created. They are: *Darling Downs-West Moreton incorporating the former Toowoomba and Darling Downs and West Moreton South Burnett districts. *Sunshine Coast-Wide Bay incorporating the Sunshine Coast ‚Äì Cooloola, Wide Bay and Fraser Coast health service districts. *Metro South incorporates the Southside Health Service District and Princess Alexandra Hospital. *Metro North incorporates the Northside Health Service District and Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital. *Children's Health Services, will oversee the implementation of a Statewide paediatric service. =Health Quality and Complaints Commission= In response to the Forster Review of Queensland Health Systems an independent Health Quality and Complaints Commission was established on 1 July 2006 to allow patients to lodge complaints about health matters. The (full-time) Commissioner is Professor Michael Ward, a former Professor of Medicine at the University of Queensland. There are also a number of part-time Assistant Commissioners. The Health Quality and Complaints Commission also has a role in the development and implementation of quality, safety and clinical practice standards throughout Queensland's public and private services and monitor best practice clinical governance and patient safety. It was subject to review by an all- party Parliamentary Committee after its first full year of operation. The HQCC has since been replaced by the Office of the Health Ombudsman. =Payroll System Commission of Inquiry= The Queensland Health Payroll System Commission of Inquiry (QHPSCI) was established by order of the Governor in Council on 13 December 2012. The Honourable Richard Chesterman AO RFD QC commenced the Inquiry on 1 February 2013. In his remarks at the directions hearing, Commissioner Chesterman explained the purpose of the inquiry \\"is to determine why such large amounts of money have been lost to the public, whether anything might be recovered; and why such distress was inflicted on the Queensland Health workforce.\\" http://www.healthpayrollinquiry.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/175013/Commissioners- remarks-directions-hearing-February-1-2013.pdf. Commissioner's directions hearing remarks. QHPSCI's public hearings began on Monday 11 March 2013 with phase one focusing on the \\"Tender Process\\". The second phase, examining the 'Contract' with IBM, commenced on 22 April 2013. The third and final phase, \\"Settlement\\", began on Monday 27 May 2013. The former Premier and two ex- ministers were called to give evidence during this phase. A special hearing was held on the 18 June 2013 to deal with late information submitted to the Commission. The QHPSCI will present its findings to the Premier on 31 July 2013. =Proposed abolishment= Former Premier Anna Bligh announced on 12 December 2011 that the department would be dismantled. The decision was attributed to an \\"unacceptable culture\\", the theft of $16 million from the department and problems with the payroll system which has cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The department was due to cease operations on 1 July 2012. In January 2012, more details of the reform plan were announced, with an emphasis on health care management to be done locally. Bligh described the changes as the biggest decentralisation of the public sector in the state's history. In March 2012, the ALP lost power in Queensland and the proposed abolition of Queensland Health did not eventuate. =2012 restructure= Following Queensland's agreement to participate in National Health Care Reform in 2011, an Australian Health Care Agreement was signed that required the creation of local hospital networks that would be directly funded by the Commonwealth.Australian Health Care Agreements National Healthcare Agreement 2011 In May 2012 legislation was proposed by Lawrence Springborg to formalise the conversion of the health districts created in the 2005 restructure to independent local Hospital and Health Services (HHSs).Health and Hospital Network and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 Under the new arrangements the HHSs each have their own board to manage and oversee the operations of the HHS.Hospital and Health Services The boards are accountable to the minister for health, and a \\"system manager\\" Corporate Office transition to System Manager was established to provide oversight and support to each of the services. These changes became effective on 1 July 2012. Structure Queensland Health consists of the Department of Health and 16 Health and Hospital Services (HHSs). =Health and Hospital Services= The Health and Hospital Services are independent statutory bodies which are responsible for delivering public health services in their areas. Each HHS is governed by a Hospital and Health Board and managed by a Health Service Chief Executive. There are 16 HHSs: *Cairns and Hinterland *Central Queensland *Central West *Children's Health Queensland *Darling Downs *Gold Coast *Mackay *Metro North *Metro South *North West *South West *Sunshine Coast *Torres and Cape *Townsville *West Moreton *Wide Bay CriticismJayant Patel scandal= Queensland Health and the Bundaberg Base Hospital were involved in a scandal surrounding the employment of surgeon Jayant Patel. The Queensland Medical Board approved his registration and he was then quickly promoted to Director of Surgery even though he lacked specific qualifications. In March 2005, Rob Messenger raised concerns with Patel's medical practices in the Queensland Parliament after he was contacted by senior hospital nurse Toni Hoffman. Hoffman received the Order of Australia medal and 2006 Australian of the Year Local Hero Award for her role as a whistleblower. An inquiry into the matter known as the Morris Inquiry was started but was terminated on the grounds of perceived bias. A second inquiry known as the Davies Inquiry found that the Queensland Health district manager and the hospital's Director of Medical Services had mostly ignored more than 20 complaints regarding Patel. On 1 July 2010, Patel was sentenced to seven years' jail after he was found guilty of three charges of manslaughter and one count of grievous bodily harm. =Payroll problems= In April 2010, it was revealed that many Queensland Health staff were experiencing incorrect payment of wages since the introduction of a new payroll system. The WorkBrain/SAP was a new system which replaced the LATTICE system. It went live in March 2010, without adequate testing and despite warnings from SAP and IBM. The problem was not resolved by May, with 35,000 wage anomalies to be fixed, but some progress had been made. The State was advised that it could sue IBM for damages totaling $88M. pg216 On 23 November 2010, the Queensland government announced that a negotiated settlement with IBM will spend $209 million over three years to resolve payroll problems. The system is very labor-intensive and requires ten times the staff as other systems. It is estimated to cost $1.2B before 2018 when it is recommended to be replaced. According to the 2013 Commission of Inquiry, \\"the QH payroll system must take a place in the front rank of failures in public administration in this country\\".

On March 8, 2006, the Proffitt's and McRae's stores were converted into Belk stores. Belk acquired the two chains in July 2005 from Saks, Inc. HistoryBeginnings= Jeweler David W. Proffitt and James Ellis founded the Ellis- Proffitt Co. on Main Street in downtown Maryville, Tennessee, in 1919. The first store had seven departments: ladies ready-to-wear, ladies accessories, millinery, men's shoes, dry goods, and bargain basement. Ellis sold his share of the company to Proffitt in 1921 due to illness. The company expanded by opening its second store in Athens, Tennessee in 1936. In the 1960s, the Maryville store moved from downtown to Midland Plaza in Alcoa. In 1982 the store relocated again to Foothills Mall in Maryville where two stores remained until the Belk acquisition, one for Women and the other for Men, Kids, and Home. A warehouse and distribution center opened in Maryville in 1970. A location in Knoxville opened in 1972 in West Town Mall with an Oak Ridge store following in 1974. A second Knoxville store was added in 1984 at East Towne Mall (now Knoxville Center). In 1984, the company had four stores and annual sales of $40 million.Alison Gillespie, Growing Proffitt's, Retail Traffic, May 1, 1998 For the first 65 years of its existence, the company was a family- owned business, but in 1984 it was acquired by RBM Acquisition Co., led by R. Brad Martin. =Going public= Proffitt's Inc. went public on July 3, 1987 on the NASDAQ market under the symbol PRFT.Saks, Inc. History, Saks, Inc. website, accessed July 17, 2008 The West Town Mall location in Knoxville was expanded to later that year making it the largest store in the chain. Proffitt's purchased the Chattanooga based Loveman's Department Store in 1986, adding four Chattanooga stores and one in Dalton, Georgia, its first location outside of Tennessee. In 1989, a new store opened in Biltmore Square Mall in Asheville, North Carolina, bringing the total stores to eleven. The years 1992 and 1993 saw a number of acquisitions, making Proffitt's one of the fastest growing retailers in the US. During that time, the company purchased 18 Hess's locations in Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, and Georgia. Some of these locations were formerly Miller's of Tennessee stores. This added new stores in Rome, Georgia; Elizabethtown and Ashland, Kentucky; Bristol, Virginia; and Kingsport and Johnson City, Tennessee. In fall 1992, shortly before the Hess's purchase was completed, a new Proffitt's store opened in The Mall at Johnson City in the company's entry into the Tri-Cities market. The Hess's purchase led to a dual-store format in the mall, similar to the one in the Foothills Mall in Maryville. In Johnson City, once the Hess's store was vacated and renovated, the Men's and Home Stores were moved to that building, leaving Women's and Children's in the newly constructed Proffitt's building. =Acquisitions of McRae's and Parks-Belk= Proffitt's purchased the Jackson, Mississippi based McRae's chain in 1994. The McRae's stores, unlike the previous acquisitions, continued to operate separately and under their nameplate. In 1995, Proffitt's purchased Parks-Belk, an independently owned affiliate of Charlotte, North Carolina based Belk, Inc. This purchase gave Proffitt's a presence for the first time in Greeneville, Tennessee, and gave the company an additional store in each mall in Kingsport and Johnson City. A Parks-Belk location in Morristown, Tennessee was part of the deal, but the store was closed instead of being converted to a Proffitt's. The Johnson City Proffitt's was already operating under the dual-location concept and this gave the company three stores in the same mall. The former Hess's store (now home to Forever 21, formerly Goody's Family Clothing) which housed the Men's and Home Store was vacated and relocated to the former Belk site along with the Children's department. This move created the largest Proffitt's Men's Store in the company and allowed the Women's department its own store. The former Hess store in the Fort Henry Mall in Kingsport was transformed into the largest Proffitt's Home Store, with all other departments remaining in the former Parks-Belk location. Proffitt's would later open stores in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Morgantown and Parkersburg, WV, and they would eventually build a new store at College Square Mall in Morristown, Tennessee. =Acquisitions of the Parisian, Younkers, Herberger's, and Carson Pirie Scott chains, and stores from Dillard's= Birmingham, Alabama, based Parisian and Younkers of Des Moines, Iowa, were both acquired in 1996 and retained their names and operating units. Herberger's was purchased in 1997 and kept its nameplate. In the same year the company moved from the NASDAQ to the New York Stock Exchange and began trading under the PFT symbol. The company purchased the Carson Pirie Scott chain in 1998 which also consisted of Boston Store and Bergner's and they continued to operate those stores under their respective names. Later in 1998, the company purchased North Carolina based Brody's and those stores were converted to the Proffitt's name. 1998 also saw Proffitt's acquire a group of 15 stores from Dillard's after its buyout of Mercantile Stores. Five former Castner Knott store in Nashville, Tennessee were renamed Proffitt's, but sold in 2001 to May Department Stores (operated as Hecht's until 2006, now Macy's) after proving marginally profitable under Proffitt's management. The former Brody's stores were sold to Belk in 2004. Also, in 2004, Proffitt's opened a store in Alabama at the Riverchase Galleria in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover in the location vacated by Macy's which now houses a Von Maur store. The Carson Pirie Scott, Bergner's, Boston Store, Herberger's, and Younkers names were eventually sold to Bon-Ton Stores on March 6, 2006. =Merger with Saks Fifth Avenue= Late 1998 would see the biggest name change when Proffitt's purchased Saks Holdings Inc, the holding company for luxury retailer Saks Fifth Avenue. Upon closing of the acquisition the company name changed to Saks, Inc. and its NYSE ticker symbol changed to SKS. =Sale to Belk= The McRae's operations would ultimately be consolidated into the Proffitt's division's Alcoa, Tennessee, based offices. They would however, continue to operate under the McRae's name. The year 2005 would signal the end of the Proffitt's and McRae's names with the purchase of those stores by Belk. On March 8, 2006, all McRae's and Proffitt's stores were converted into Belk stores. The conversion ended two of the most well-known retailing names in the southern United States. The only exceptions were two Alabama McRae's stores in Tuscaloosa and Gadsden, which were retained to convert into Parisian locations. On October 2, 2006, the Parisian unit was sold to Belk and these two locations were rebranded as Belk stores almost a year after the purchase. ReferencesExternal links *Belk *Saks, Inc.

After the sale, McRae's stores retained their name and were operated as a separate subsidiary. Proffitt's merged with Saks Holdings, owner of Saks Fifth Avenue, in 1998. The merged company changed its name to Saks Incorporated.Wally Northway, \\"Saks operations center committed to Jackson\\", The Mississippi Business Journal, July 2, 2007. Proffitt's and McRae's became part of Saks Incorporated's Southern Department Store Group. Foley's acquired one McRae's in Louisiana at The Mall at Cortana. As Saks sought repositioning as a more luxury retail-oriented operation, its mid-range chains became targets for sale. McRae's and Proffitt's were among the first to be sold. Charlotte-based Belk, the nation's largest privately owned department store chain, bought Proffitt's/McRae's in a deal that closed in July 2005.\\"Belk buys Proffitt's, McRae's from Saks\\", Nashville Business Journal, April 29, 2005.\\"Saks Incorporated Completes Sale of Proffitt's/McRae's to Belk, Inc.; Company Discusses Use of Transaction Proceeds and Success of Tender Offers and Consent Solicitations\\", Business Wire, July 2, 2005.

The climax of the book occurs before the Battle of N√°jera. Doyle became inspired to write the novel after attending a lecture on the Middle Ages in 1889. After extensive research, The White Company was published in serialized form in 1891 in Cornhill Magazine. Additionally, the book is considered a companion to Doyle's later work Sir Nigel, which explores the early campaigns of Sir Nigel Loring and Samkin Aylward. The novel is relatively unknown today, though it was very popular up through the Second World War. In fact, Doyle himself regarded this and his other historical novels more highly than the Sherlock Holmes adventures for which he is mainly remembered. The \\"White Company\\" of the title is a free company of archers, led by one of the main characters. The name is taken from a real-life 14th-century Italian mercenary company, led by John Hawkwood. Plot At the age of twenty, young Alleyne, son of Edric, leaves the Catholic abbey where he has been raised‚Äîintelligent, skilled, and well- liked, though sheltered and naive‚Äîand goes out to see the world, in accordance with the terms of his father's will. The same day, the abbot banishes John of Hordle for worldly behavior: great appetite, teasing, and flirting. They meet at the Pied Merlin inn as they each rest for the night. There, they make friends with veteran archer Sam Aylward who has returned to England from France to recruit for the White Company of mercenaries. Aylward has brought a request for Sir Nigel Loring of Christchurch to take command of the company. Aylward and John continue to Christchurch, while Alleyne detours to visit his older brother, the socman or landlord of Minstead, whose fierce reputation has grown to wickedness. The brothers meet for the first time since Alleyne was an infant and Alleyne finds that his brother is still furious their father gave three hides of land (80‚Äì120 acres) to the monastery for the boy's support. The socman threatens a lovely maiden, Maude, who escapes with Alleyne's aid and they flee on foot to find her horse. Maude makes a striking impression on the abbey-raised young man. When she hears that Alleyne intends to rejoin his friends to approach Sir Nigel Loring, Maude laughs and leaves him. Alleyne meets up again with Aylward and Hordle John, and the three friends meet Sir Nigel and his formidable wife Mary. There, he learns that Maude is Sir Nigel's daughter. Alleyne is taken on as squire to Sir Nigel and as tutor to Maude. When the men eventually depart for France, the young couple admit their love, but only to each other. En route to Gascony, our heroes destroy pirates, then report to the court of the Prince of Wales in Bordeaux. After adventures fearful and funny, the valiant fighters lead the White Company to join the Prince. A letter arrives to Sir Nigel declaring that Alleyne's brother, the Socman of Minstead, had attacked Sir Nigel's castle. During the siege, the socman died. This news means that Alleyne is the new socman and emboldens him to declare his love for Maude to Sir Nigel. Sir Nigel is startled by the news and Alleyne's declaration, but indicates that he prefers that Alleyne should be a full knight before he approaches Maude again with talk of love. The Spanish and French attack them in a narrow ravine, where the mighty warriors are almost all destroyed and the Company must disband -- only seven bowmen remain, including John. Alleyne was badly wounded when Sir Nigel sent him to alert the Prince to their plight. Sir Nigel and Aylward are missing and presumed dead. The English go on to win the Battle of N√°jera, fulfilling the mission. The Prince knights Alleyne in his sick bed. Alleyne returns to England victorious with John as his squire, only to learn from a lady on the road that Maude and her mother had news that none of the White Company had survived. The lady said that love of a \\"golden-haired squire\\", who was presumed dead with the fighters, had caused Maude to decide to join a nunnery. The lady had left just before Maude was to take the veil. Alleyne rushes to the doors of the nunnery and he and Maude embrace. They marry. Alleyn and John prepare to return to find out what happened to Sir Nigel and Aylward. As Alleyne rides to see if the boat is ready to take them, he meets Aylward and Sir Nigel. They have a tale of adventure describing what occurred after they were captured by the Spanish, but eventually escaped to return to England. And everyone lives happily ever after. CharactersMain characters= *Alleyne Edricson: through the wishes of his father, he has been raised by monks of Beaulieu. Upon reaching the age of twenty he leaves the Abbey and goes into the world. During the next two years, Alleyne becomes a squire to Sir Nigel Loring, and travels to France to join the White Company, a band of archers. When Alleyne performs a great feat of valour, he himself becomes a knight. Upon returning to England, he weds Sir Nigel's daughter. *Sir Nigel Loring: based loosely on the real life figure Sir Neil Loring, he is a valiant but baldheaded little knight, known and admired by every lord and soldier on both sides of the English Channel. He constantly hopes to engage in jousts and sword fights for honor and glory. He is famed for his deeds at several battles including those of Cr√©cy and Poitiers. He is the Constable of Twynham Castle. *Lady Maude: Sir Nigel's daughter and Alleyne's love. She has a mind of her own and is a fairly modern character. Sir Nigel knows better than to thwart her when her mind is set on something, such as loving Alleyne. He merely indicates that Alleyne should be a full knight before Alleyne proposes. *Samkin Aylward: An elite archer who has spent most of his life as a soldier. His excellent shooting skills, hardy constitution, sense of humour, and good luck have seen him through many battles, allowing him to pursue his chief pastime - wooing and flirting with women. His valour saves Sir Nigel's life on numerous occasions. *John of Hordle, or Hordle John: Was briefly a novice at Beaulieu before being expelled from the monastery for unfitting behavior. A huge man of great strength and sarcastic wit, he also saves the day several times, and is Alleyne's squire at the end of the novel. =Other characters= *Abbot Berghersh *Sir Oliver Buttesthorn *Simon Edricson, Socman of Minstead *Walter Ford, esquire *Goodwin Hawtayne *Sir Claude Latour *Lady Mary Loring *Black Simon of Norwich *Peter Terlake, esquire *John Tranter =Historical figures who appear as characters in the novel= *James Audley *Bernard Brocas *Hugh Calveley *Henry II of Castile *Peter of Castile *John Chandos *Olivier de Clisson *Edward III of England *Edward, the Black Prince * Thomas Felton *William Felton *John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster *Jean III de Grailly, captal de Buch *Bertrand du Guesclin *Robert Knolles *James IV of Majorca *Charles II of Navarre *Thomas Percy, 1st Earl of Worcester *Sir Simon de Burley There was a real knight named Sir Nigel Loring at the time when the novel is set, but the historical record supplied few details and his role in the book is largely Doyle's invention. He is known to have been an original member of the Order of the Garter, and to have been in the Black Prince's bodyguard, particularly at the Battle of Poitiers on 19 September 1356. He was also a member of the Prince's war council and his chamberlain, and was part of the delegation that negotiated a truce at Bordeaux. As a reward for his role in that battle, he was granted 83 pounds per annum by the Prince. Influence *Amory Blaine, the protagonist in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1920 novel This Side of Paradise, reads The White Company early in the book. *Several of the characters in S. M. Stirling's Emberverse novels share names with characters from this book and are apparently descendants or reincarnations of the characters, and Stirling has acknowledged its influence on his own writing. *Two minor character names appear in the 2001 Hollywood film A Knight's Tale, specifically \\"Delves of Dodgington\\" (Delves of Doddington in the novel) and \\"Fowlehurst of Crewe\\" as fake names for the characters Roland and Wat, respectively. Delves and Fowlehurst were both historic characters being Squires of Sir James Audley at the Battle of Poitiers.

The area is a residential and commercial locale and is filled with the homes and businesses of many politicians, diplomats, expatriates, and artists. It is home to Tehran's most expensive real estate as well as the clubhouses of the Russia, Turkey, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Belgium, Iceland, Cuba and Finland embassies. The most famous part of the district is Fereshteh Street, which has been the most expensive street in Tehran. This is where the newest buildings and many fashionable locales, including top-end shops and chichi cafes, can be found. Fereshteh used to be one of the most quiet, peaceful and greenest part of northern Tehran with vast gardens but has seen significant development and real estate investment after the Islamic revolution, especially during a construction boom in the 1990s, when Gholamhossein Karbaschi and Ghalibaaf served as mayor of Tehran. During this boom, many of the huge gardens and large houses were replaced with the most fashionable high rises which has increased the population of this area significantly. This has caused problems for narrow alleys around this area; the traffic often gets gridlocked on summer nights. In the book The Ayatollah Begs to Differ, Hooman Majd says that Elahieh is one of Tehran's \\"most fashionable districts\\" in Tehran, since this area included big gardens and mansions with eye catching architecture designs. It was perhaps the greenest part of northern Tehran as it was receiving most of mountain waters. The highest part of Elahieh had the most beautiful and scenic garden view in northern Tehran.  About  Elahiyeh is an upper class district in Northern Tehran, actually a part of Shemiran. Before Shemiran was officially incorporated into the city of Tehran, the area consisted of expensive residences and gardens used as summer homes for wealthy residents of Tehran. Today however residential towers and upscale penthouses have replaced them for good and few of those gardens have actually escaped development. Persian classical musician Esmaiel Mehrtash was living in Koohyar street in Fereshteh Avenue. Esmail Mehrtash, a tar player and musician, established Jame'eh Barbod in 1926, where operettas such as \\"Leili & Majnoun\\", \\"Khosrow & Shirin\\" as well as \\"Khayyam\\" went on stage. Dr. Mahmoud Hessaby (1903‚Äì1992) a prominent Iranian scientist, researcher and distinguished professor of University of Tehran also lived in Elahieh on Hessaby Street. He was the receiver of the medal of the commandeur de la L√©gion d'honneur, France's highest scientific medal in 1957 for his achievements, including his classic paper on \\"Continuous particles\\" and his model of \\"Infinitely extended particles\\". The house of the former military leader and Cabinet Minister of Iran during Reza Shah Lieutenant General Ahmad Amir-Ahmadi (1884‚Äì1974) (now a museum) is in Elahieh on Hessabi Street, and is the newly opened Iranian Art Garden Museum, which is home to some replicas of Iran's best known historical monuments, an art gallery, and a nice outdoor cafe. Sepahbod Ahmad Amir-Ahmadi was the first Iranian lieutenant General in Iran. He was appointed as the minister of interior (1942) and minister of war (1948) during Reza Shah dynasty. He was also appointed a senator to the first senate and held it for sixteen years. Most of the land in this district once belonged to Mrs. Fakhr ol dowleh, a daughter of Mozaffareddin Shah Qajar, known to be the richest woman in Iran during her life.

Located on the National Mall, it was constructed in 1931 as a domed, peristyle Doric temple. History The memorial at night. The memorial was built to honor World War I soldiers that died in the war. It stands in West Potomac Park slightly off of Independence Avenue in a grove of trees. Authorized by an act of Congress on June 7, 1924, funds to construct the memorial were provided by the contributions of both organizations and individual citizens of the District. Construction of the memorial began in the spring of 1931, and the memorial was dedicated by President Herbert Hoover on November 11, 1931 (Armistice Day). It was the first war memorial to be erected in West Potomac Park, part of the National Mall near the Lincoln Memorial, and remains the only local District memorial on the National Mall. Designed by Washington architect Frederick H. Brooke, with Horace W. Peaslee and Nathan C. Wyeth as associate architects, the District of Columbia War Memorial is in the form of a 47-foot (14.3 m) tall circular, domed, peristyle Doric temple. Resting on concrete foundations, the 4 foot (1.2 m) high marble base defines a platform, 43 feet 5 inches (13.2 m) in diameter, intended for use as a bandstand. Preserved in the cornerstone of the District of Columbia World War Memorial is a list of 26,000 Washingtonians who served in the Great War. Inscribed on the base are the names of the 499 District of Columbia citizens who lost their lives in the war, together with medallions representing the branches of the armed forces. Twelve 22-foot (6.7 m) tall fluted Doric marble columns support the entablature and dome. In September 2008, Rep. Ted Poe of Texas, with the support of Frank Buckles, then the last living US veteran of World War I, proposed a bill in Congress stating the memorial should be expanded and designated the national memorial to World War I. In July 2010, the National Park Service announced that restoration work, funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, would soon begin on the memorial. Work began in October 2010, and the memorial reopened on November 10, 2011. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. The memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks unit.

They help integrate and regulate the input from multiple photoreceptor cells. Among their functions, horizontal cells are believed to be responsible for increasing contrast via lateral inhibition and adapting both to bright and dim light conditions. Horizontal cells provide inhibitory feedback to rod and cone photoreceptors. They are thought to be important for the antagonistic center- surround property of the receptive fields of many types of retinal ganglion cells. Other retinal neurons include photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and retinal ganglion cells.

Horizontal cells span across photoreceptors and summate inputs before synapsing onto photoreceptor cells. Horizontal cells may also synapse onto bipolar cells, but this remains uncertain. There is a greater density of horizontal cells towards the central region of the retina. In the cat, it is observed that A-type horizontal cells have a density of 225 cells/mm2 near the center of the retina and a density of 120 cells/mm2 in more peripheral retina. Horizontal cells and other retinal interneuron cells are less likely to be near neighbours of the same subtype than would occur by chance, resulting in ‚Äòexclusion zones‚Äô that separate them. Mosaic arrangements provide a mechanism to distribute each cell type evenly across the retina, ensuring that all parts of the visual field have access to a full set of processing elements. MEGF10 and MEGF11 transmembrane proteins have critical roles in the formation of the mosaics by horizontal cells and starburst amacrine cells in mice. Function Horizontal cells are depolarized by the release of glutamate from photoreceptors, which happens in the absence of light. Depolarization of a horizontal cell causes it to hyperpolarize nearby photoreceptors. Conversely, in the light a photoreceptor releases less glutamate, which hyperpolarizes the horizontal cell, leading to depolarization of nearby photoreceptors. Thus, horizontal cells provide negative feedback to photoreceptors. The moderately wide lateral spread and coupling of horizontal cells by gap junctions, measures the average level of illumination falling upon a region of the retinal surface, which horizontal cells then subtract a proportionate value from the output of photoreceptors to hold the signal input to the inner retinal circuitry within its operating range. Horizontal cells are also one of two groups of inhibitory interneurons that contribute to the surround of retinal ganglion cells: Illumination \\\\to Center photoreceptor hyperpolarization \\\\to Horizontal cell hyperpolarization \\\\to Surround photoreceptor depolarization The exact mechanism by which depolarization of horizontal cells hyperpolarizes photoreceptors is uncertain. Although horizontal cells contain GABA, the main mechanisms by which horizontal cells inhibit cones probably do not involve the release of GABA by horizontal cells onto cones. Two mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive likely contribute to horizontal cell inhibition of glutamate release by cones. Both postulated mechanisms depend on the protected environment provided by the invaginating synapses that horizontal cells make onto cones. The first postulated mechanism is a very fast ephaptic mechanism that has no synaptic delay, making it one of the fastest inhibitory synapses known. The second postulated mechanism is relatively slow with a time constant of about 200 ms and depends on ATP release via Pannexin 1 channels located on horizontal cell dendrites invaginating the cone synaptic terminal. The ecto-ATPase NTPDase1 hydrolyses extracellular ATP to AMP, phosphate groups, and protons. The phosphate groups and protons form a pH buffer with a pKa of 7.2, which keeps the pH in the synaptic cleft relatively acidic. This inhibits the cone Ca2+ channels and consequently reduces the glutamate release by the cones. The center-surround antagonism of bipolar cells is thought to be inherited from cones. However, when recordings are made from parts of the cone that are distant from the cone terminals that synapse onto bipolar cells, center-surround antagonism seems to be less reliable in cones than in bipolar cells. As the invaginating synapses from horizontal cells are made onto cone terminals, the center-surround antagonism of cones is thought to be more reliably present in cone terminals.

Most live in fresh water, but some are found in marine and soil habitats. They vary from single-celled flagellates to simple colonial and filamentous forms. Xanthophyte chloroplasts contain the photosynthetic pigments chlorophyll a, chlorophyll c, Œ≤-carotene, and the carotenoid diadinoxanthin. Unlike other heterokonts, their chloroplasts do not contain fucoxanthin, which accounts for their lighter colour. Their storage polysaccharide is chrysolaminarin. Xanthophyte cell walls are produced of cellulose and hemicellulose. They appear to be the closest relatives of the brown algae. Classifications The species now placed in the Xanthophyceae were formerly included in the Chlorophyceae.Chapman, V. J. An Introduction to the Study of Algae. University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Company, New York, 1941, p. 18, . In 1899, L√ºther created the group Heterokontae for green algae with unequal flagella. Pascher (1914) included the Heterokontae in the Chrysophyta. In 1930, Allorge renamed the group as Xanthophyceae.

In 1333 he captured Gibraltar from the Castilians, although a later attempt to take Tarifa in 1339 ended in fiasco. In North Africa he extended his rule over Tlemcen and Ifriqiya, which together covered the north of what is now Algeria and Tunisia. Under him the Marinid realms in the Maghreb briefly covered an area that rivaled that of the preceding Almohad Caliphate. However, he was forced to retreat due to a revolt of the Arab tribes, was shipwrecked, and lost many of his supporters. His son Abu Inan Faris seized power in Fez. Abu Al-Hasan died in exile in the High Atlas mountains. Early years Abu al- Hassan was the son of Marinid ruler Abu Sa'id Uthman II and an Abyssinian mother. He had a dark complexion, and was known as the 'Black Sultan' of Morocco. He succeeded his father Abu Sa'id Uthman II in 1331. Abu al-Hassan married Fatima, daughter of the Hafsid ruler Abu Bakr of Ifriqiya, sealing an alliance between the Marinids and Hafsids against the Zayyanid dynasty of Tlemcen. CampaignsGibraltar= Strait of Gibraltar, with Ceuta in the southeast opposite Algeciras Bay and Gibraltar. In 1309, Castillian troops under Ferdinand IV captured Gibraltar, then known as the Medinat al-Fath (City of Victory), from the Muslim-ruled Emirate of Granada. In 1333, responding to the appeal of Nasrid ruler Muhammad IV of Granada, Abu al-Hassan sent a Moroccan army to Algeciras under the command of his son Abd al-Malik Abd al- Wahid. A force of 7,000 men was transported across the Strait of Gibraltar to rendezvous with the forces of Muhammad IV of Granada at Algeciras in February 1333. The Castilians were distracted by the coronation of King Alfonso XI and were slow to respond to the invasion force, which was able to lay siege to Gibraltar before much of a response could be organised. The situation in Gibraltar was desperate by mid-June. The food had run out and the townspeople and garrison had been reduced to eating their own shields, belts and shoes in an attempt to gain sustenance from the leather from which they were made. On 17 June 1333, Vasco Perez surrendered Gibraltar after agreeing terms with Abd al-Malik. The defenders were allowed to leave with honour as a mark of respect for their courage in defending the town for so long. The fall of Gibraltar was rapturously received back in Morocco; the Moorish chronicler Ibn Marzuq recorded that while he was studying in Tlemcen, his teacher announced to his class: \\"Rejoice, community of the faithful, because God has had the goodness to restore Gibraltar to us!\\" According to Ibn Marzuq, the jubilant students burst out into cries of praise, gave thanks and shed tears of joy. The success of the Gibraltar campaign stoked fears in the Granadan court that the Marinids would become too influential, and provoked the assassination of Muhammad IV by resentful Granadan nobles only a few months later. However, Abu al-Hasan was not ready to invade the Iberian peninsula since he was engaged in hostilities with Tlemcen. Muhammad IV's brother and successor, Yusuf I of Granada maintained the alliance with the Marinid ruler. A peace treaty was signed at Fez on 26 February 1334 between Castile, Granada and Morocco with a four-year duration. =Tlemcen= The Marinid empire at its greatest extent, around 1348. The ruler of Tlemcen, Ibn Tashufin (r. 1318‚Äì1337), initiated hostilities against Ifriqiya, besieged B√©ja√Øa, and sent an army into Tunisia that defeated the Hafsid king Abu Yahya Abu Bakr II, who fled to Constantine while the Zayyanids occupied Tunis. Abu al-Hassan was married to a Hafsid princess, and in 1334 the Hafsids appealed to him for help, giving him a welcome excuse for invading his neighbor. In early 1335, Marinid forces under Abu al-Hassan invaded Tlemcen from the west and dispatched a naval force to assist the Hafsids from the east. The Zayyanids were rolled back into the city of Tlemcen. The Marinid sultan Abu al-Hassan laid a three-year siege of Tlemcen, turning his siege camp into a veritable adjoining city. In 1336 or 1337, Abu al-Hassan suspended the siege of Tlemcen to campaign in southern Morocco, where his troublesome brother, Abu Ali, who ruled an appanage at Sijilmassa, was threatening to divide the Marinid dominions. In May 1337, after a two-year siege, Tlemcen finally fell to a Marinid assault. Ibn Tashufin died during the fighting. His brothers were captured and killed and the Sultanate of Tlemcen (covering roughly modern western half of Algeria) was annexed by the Marinids. Abu al-Hasan received delegates from Egypt, Granada, Tunis and Mali congratulating him on his victory, by which he had gained complete control of the trans-Saharan trade. =Tarifa= Flush from these victories, in 1339, Abu al-Hassan received an appeal from the Nasrid ruler Yusuf I of Granada to help drive back the Castilians. The assembly of a large Marinid invasion force in Morocco prompted the Castilian king Alfonso XI to bring to an end his quarrel with Afonso IV of Portugal. In April 1340, a Castilian fleet of some 32 galleys under admiral Alonso Jofr√© Tenorio set out against the Marinid invasion fleet being outfitted at Ceuta. The Marinid fleet, under the command of Muhammad ibn Ali al-Azafi, destroyed the Castilian fleet in the naval battle of Gibraltar on 5 April 1340. The Castilian admiral Tenorio was killed during the engagement and only five Castilian galleys managed to make it safely out. With the sea now clear for an invasion, Abu al-Hassan spent the rest of the summer calmly ferrying his troops and supplies across the straits to Algeciras. Abu al-Hassan crossed with the bulk of the Marinid forces in August 1340. The Marinid invasion force joined up with Granadan forces under Yusuf I in September, and together proceeded to lay siege to Tarifa. A desperate Alfonso XI appealed to his father-in-law, the Portuguese king Afonso IV for assistance. In October 1340, a Portuguese fleet under Manuel Pessanha, supplemented by a leased Genoese fleet, managed to move into position off Tarifa and cut off the besiegers' supply line to Morocco. In the meantime, Afonso IV of Portugal led an army overland to join Alfonso XI of Castile near Seville, and together they moved against the besiegers at Tarifa. The Marinid- Nasrid forces were defeated at the Battle of R√≠o Salado in October, 1340, and Abu al-Hassan was forced to retreat back to Algeciras. After this defeat, Al- Hasan ended his campaigns in the Iberian Peninsula. A few years later, Alfonso XI of Castile had little difficulty taking Algeciras in March 1344. =Ifriqiya= In 1346 the Hafsid Sultan, Abu Bakr, died and a dispute over the succession ensued. Several Ifriqiyan parties appealed to the Marinid ruler for assistance. In a campaign in early 1347, Abu al-Hassan's Moroccan army swept through Ifriqiya and entered Tunis in September, 1347. By uniting Morocco, Tlemcen and Ifriqiya, the Marinid ruler Abu al-Hassan effectively accomplished the conquest of dominions as great as the Almohad empire of the Maghreb, and the comparison was not lost on contemporaries. Revolt and death Dinar minted during his reign However, Abu al-Hassan went too far in attempting to impose more authority over the Arab tribes. They revolted and in April 1348 defeated his army near Kairouan. His son, Abu Inan Faris, who had been serving as governor of Tlemcen, returned to Fez and declared that he was the sultan. Tlemcen and the central Maghreb revolted. The Zayyanid Abu Sa'id Uthman II was proclaimed king of Tlemcen. Abu al-Hassan's fleet was wrecked on its homeward journey by a tempest off Bougie, and the once mighty sultan was left stranded in the heart of enemy territory. Abu al-Hassan escaped capture and made his way to join his partisans in Algiers. He managed to gather enough forces to attempt a march to recover Tlemcen, but was defeated by the resurgent Abdalwadid princes near the Chelif River. As many of his former supporters defected, Abu al-Hassan was forced to proceed to Sijilmassa, in southern Morocco, which he hoped to use as a base to recover his sultanate. But Abu Inan's armies descended on the area, forcing Abu al-Hassan to flee with what remained of his supporters to Marrakesh. In May 1350, Abu Inan defeated Abu al-Hassan on the banks of the Oum er-Rebia. With Abu Inan on his heels, Abu al-Hassan fled into the high Atlas Mountains, taking refuge among the Hintata tribes. Broken, ill and without resources, the once-mighty Abu al- Hassan, finally agreed to abdicate in favour of Abu Inan in late 1350 or early 1351. Abu al-Hassan died in May 1351, still in his Atlas mountain hideout. His body was transferred by Abu Inan, allegedly with great public mourning, to the Marinid necropolis at Chellah. In 1352 Abu Inan Faris recaptured Tlemcen. He also reconquered the central Maghreb. He took B√©ja√Øa in 1353 and Tunis in 1357, becoming master of Ifriqiya. In 1358 he was forced to return to Fez due to Arab opposition, where he was strangled to death by his vizier.

During World War II, he collaborated with the Germans and served as the Prime Minister of a puppet government, the Government of National Salvation, in the German occupied territory of Serbia. After the war, the Yugoslav communist authorities imprisoned him. In 1946, they reported that he had committed suicide by jumping out of a prison window. Early life and military career Milan Nediƒá was born in the Belgrade suburb of Grocka on 2 September 1878 to ƒêorƒëe and Pelagia Nediƒá. His father was a local district chief and his mother was a teacher from a village near Mount Kosmaj. She was the granddaughter of Nikola Mihailoviƒá, who was mentioned in the writings of poet Sima Milutinoviƒá Sarajlija and was an ally of Serbian revolutionary leader Karaƒëorƒëe. The Nediƒá family was originally from the village of Zaoka, near Lazarevac. It traced its origins to two brothers, Damjan and Gligorije, who defended the ƒåoke≈°ina Monastery from the Turks during the Serbian Revolution. The family received its name from Nediƒá's great-grandmother, Neda, who was a member of the Vasojeviƒái tribe in Montenegro. Nediƒá finished gymnasium in Kragujevac in 1895 and entered the lower level of the Military Academy in Belgrade that year. In 1904, he completed the upper level of the academy, then the General Staff preparatory, and was commissioned into the Serbian Army. In 1910, he was promoted to the rank of major. He fought with the Serbian Army during the Balkan Wars, and received multiple decorations for bravery. In 1913, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He served with the Serbian Army during World War I and was involved in rearguard actions during its retreat through Albania in the winter of 1915. That year, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. At 38, he was the youngest colonel in the Serbian General Staff. He was appointed ordnance officer to King Peter in 1916. Towards the end of the war, Nediƒá was given command of an infantry brigade of the Timok Division. Royal Yugoslav Army Nediƒá remained a brigade commander within the Timok Division until the end of 1918 and served as the 3rd Army chief of staff. Beginning in 1919, he also served as the de facto head of the 4th Army District in Croatia because its nominal commander, General Bo≈æidar Jankoviƒá, was old and infirm. Nediƒá's cousin, Dimitrije Ljotiƒá, and their mutual friend Stanislav Krakov, also served in the 4th Army District and were commanded by Nediƒá. When the Royal Yugoslav Army (, VKJ) was formed in 1919 he was absorbed into the army at the same rank. He was promoted to Divizijski ƒëeneral in 1923, and subsequently commanded a division then was Secretary-General of the Committee of National Defence. In 1930, Nediƒá was promoted to the rank of Armijski ƒëeneral, and assumed command of the 3rd Army in Skoplje. Nediƒá was appointed Chief of the General Staff in June 1934, and held this position until the following year, when he became the third member of the Military Council, probably because of his strained relations with the Minister for the Army and Navy, Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá. At the time, British diplomatic staff observed that he was \\"somewhat slow-thinking and obstinate\\". On 13 August 1939, Nediƒá was appointed Minister of the Army and Navy as part of the Cvetkoviƒá‚ÄìMaƒçek Agreement. Ljotiƒá later assisted the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (Reich Security Central Office, RSHA) in establishing contacts with him. He also exploited the connections he had with Nediƒá to ensure that the banned Zbor- published journal Bilten (Bulletin) was distributed to members of the VKJ. The journal was published illegally in a military printing house and distributed throughout Yugoslavia by military couriers. Because of his disapproval of a potential participation in the war against Adolf Hitler's Germany, Nediƒá was dismissed on 6 November 1940 by regent Paul. This was most likely out of unease with Nazi Germany's ally, Fascist Italy which at the time harboured the Croatian extreme nationalist Ustashe leader Ante Paveliƒá in exile in Rome, and because of the rhetoric of some Italian fascists in the past such as the late Gabriele D'Annunzio, who were violently opposed to a Yugoslav state. Nediƒá welcomed the coup of 1941 which deposed the pro-Axis regime, and fought for Yugoslavia in the German-led Axis invasion that followed. =Occupied Serbia= Wehrmacht commander Heinrich Danckelmann decided to entrust Nediƒá with the administration of German-occupied territory of Serbia in order to pacify Serb resistance. Not long before, Nediƒá had lost his only son and pregnant daughter in law in a munitions explosion in Smederevo, in which several thousands died. He accepted the post of the prime minister in the government called the Government of National Salvation, on 29 August 1941. At the same time mass imprisonment of the Jews started where police and gendarmerie of quisling government under Nediƒá assisted the Germans in arresting the Jews. On 1 September 1941 Nediƒá made a speech on Radio Belgrade in which he declared the intent of his administration to \\"save the core of the Serbian people\\" by accepting the occupation of Germany in the area of Sumadija, Drina Valley, Pomoravlje and Banat. He also spoke against organizing resistance to the occupying forces. His state's propaganda was funded by Germany and promoted anti-Semitism and anti-communism, particularly linking these up with anti-masonry. In his speeches he uses terms such as \\"Communist- Jewish rabble\\" and \\"Communist-Masonic-Jewish-English mafia\\". In March 1942, Nediƒá established the Serbian State Guard (Srpska dr≈æavna stra≈æa) who together with the Gestapo participated in the guarding of the Banjica concentration camp, and were responsible for the killings of inmates, including children. In October 1943, the State Guard came under control of the SS. Its members were also engaged in the execution of captured Partisans. The puppet government under Nediƒá accepted many refugees mostly of Serbian descent. The civil war unleashed by German occupation in Serbia was the cause of losing more lives than German terror. In total, between 141,000 and 167,000 people died in Serbia of war-related causes. These deaths included 34,000 killed by the Germans and their Serb helpers, 46,000 deaths in prisons and camps, and 33,000 Chetnik and 42,000 Partisan combatants. At least 300,000 people were deported from Serbia or held in prisons and concentration camps. German reprisals demanded that 100 Serbs be killed for each killed German soldier and 50 for each wounded German soldier, as in the Kragujevac massacre. Nediƒá implemented Hitler's anti Semitic policies and Belgrade became the first city in Europe to be declared Judenfrei (\\"clean of Jews\\") while Serbia itself was declared as such in August 1942. Nediƒá also secretly diverted money and arms from his government to the Chetniks. The military forces of Ljotiƒá and Nediƒá together with the Wehrmacht participated in anti-Communist operations. In the 1942 Christmas address, he announced that \\"the old world, which had destroyed our state, is over and replaced by the new one. This new world will elevate Serbia to its rightful and honorable place in the new Europe; under the new leadership (of Germany) we look courageously into the future\\". In 1942 he outlined a memo of his vision of Great Serbia in which Bosnia-Herzegovina, Srijem, and Dalmatia are within Serbia's borders with local population replaced by Serbian settlers. On 28 February 1943, the commanding general in Serbia reduced the reprisal orders to 50 hostages for each German soldier, armed forces employee, civilian or Bulgarian soldier killed, and 25 for each German or Bulgarian wounded. Nediƒá was received by Adolf Hitler in September 1943 when they talked about security and order in the occupied territory. Nediƒá's Ministry of Education, Ljotiƒá and the intellectuals from the Zbor prepared Serbia and its youth by changing the education system in order to prepare the society for Hitler‚Äôs New Europe, in which anti-Semitism and anti- Communism were integral parts of the new ideological framework. On 4 October 1944, with the successes of the Yugoslav Partisans and their onslaught on Belgrade, Nediƒá's puppet government was disbanded, and on 6 October Nediƒá fled from Belgrade to Kitzb√ºhel, Austria (then annexed to Germany) where he took refuge with the occupying British. On 1 January 1946, the British forces handed him over to the Yugoslav Partisans. He was incarcerated in Belgrade on charges of treason. On 4 February 1946, it is believed that Nediƒá either jumped out of the window of the Belgrade hospital where he was being detained or that he was pushed out to his death. According to official records, he committed suicide by jumping through the window. Recently, Miodrag Mladenoviƒá, a former officer with of the Yugoslavian OZNA, said that on 4 February 1946, he received an order to pick up a dead body at Zmaj Jovina street, where the prison was located at the time. When he arrived there, the body was already wrapped in a blanket and rigor mortis had already set in. Following the orders given to him, he took the body to the cemetery where it was buried in an unusually deep grave. He never attempted to see the face of the person that he was carrying, but the day after, he read in the news that Nediƒá had committed suicide by jumping through the prison window at Zmaj Jovina street. Legacy After 2000, revisionists' demands for the rehabilitation of Milan Nediƒá began. Nediƒá's portrait was included among those of Serbian prime ministers in the building of the Government of Serbia. In 2008, the Minister of Interior and Deputy PM Ivica Daƒçiƒá removed the portrait after neo-Nazi marches were announced in the country. Revisionist interpretations required that Nediƒá's collaboration with the occupying forces and responsibility for the execution of Jews under his rule be obscured, in order to remember him as the \\"savior of the Serbian people\\". On 11 July 2018, The Higher Serbian Court in Belgrade rejected an application to rehabilitate the quisling Prime Minister of occupied Serbia during World War II, Milan Nediƒá. During the rehabilitation trial, historian Bojan Dimitrijevic from the Institute for Contemporary Serbian History claimed, based on archived documents, that Nediƒá was not directly involved in the persecution and killing of Jews. According to Dimitrijevic, Nediƒá's administration only registered Jews and gave them fake Serbian documents while the Germans rounded them up and performed all the executions. During the Milo≈°evic era, the regime and some Serb historians found it extremely important to win over eminent Yugoslav Jewish organizations and individuals for the idea of the joint Serbo-Jewish martyrdom. To accomplish it, Serbia had to falsify history by obscuring the fact that the Serb quislings Milan Nedic and Dimitrije Ljotic ÃÅ had cleansed Serbia of its sizeable Jewish population by deportations of Jews to East European concentration camps or killing them in Serbia. In 1995, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts published a volume entitled 100 Outstanding Serbs and included Nediƒá on the list. The minor Serbian Liberal Party attempted to promote his rehabilitation as an anti-Nazi, who did his best in an impossible situation, sparking controversy in Serbia. Other opinions claim that it was Nediƒá's role to protect Serbs from further executions in NDH and by Germans in Serbia by aiding in the persecution of Jews. Among other things, his regime confiscated and sold the property of Jews after they were executed by Germans, who were not interested in buying the homes and lands of Jews in Serbia. According to historian and President of the Jewish community in Belgrade, Ja≈°a Almuli, one of the major reasons behind the killing of 11,000 Jews in Serbia by Germans was through reprisals for resistance against Germans in occupied Serbia and that Jews were killed for the same reasons as Serbs: to fulfill Hitler's quota towards Serbs and Serbia: for a wounded soldier to kill 50 and for a dead German soldier to kill 100 people. For that reason, together with Serbs and Gypsies, about 5000 Jews were shot. German SS General Harald Turner was the main culprit behind the shooting of Jews in occupied Serbia. According to Philip J. Cohen, in Nediƒá's Serbia about 15,000 Jews perished or 94% of Serbian Jews. According to Jelena Subotiƒá, 27,000 Jews out of 33,500 in pre- occupied Serbia were killed in the Holocaust, and another 1,000 from central Europe, mostly from Czechoslovakia and Austria. Of the approximately 17,000 Jews who resided in German-occupied Serbia, 82% of them were killed early on, including 11,000 Belgrade Jews. The 1993 book \\"One Hundred Greatest Serbs\\" published by the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts included an entry on Nediƒá in which its editor, the historian Dejan Medakoviƒá, claimed that Nediƒá was \\"one of the most tragic figures in Serbian history\\" whose collaboration saved \\"a million Serbian lives\\". Patriarch Pavle held a memorial service for Nediƒá in 1994, during which he justified his collaboration with Nazi Germany on the grounds that it was \\"the only way to save the Serbian people from the revenge of the occupiers\\". Similarly, the publisher of a 2002 secondary school history textbook, Neboj≈°a Jovanoviƒá, told the daily Politika that collaboration with the Nazis was a way of preserving the ‚Äòbiological substance of the Serbian people\\".

Although they are thought to be primitive forms, they have no fossil record. The Argulidae are the only family in the order Arguloida (occasionally \\"Arguloidea\\"), although a second family, the Dipteropeltidae, has been proposed. Description Fish lice vary in size from just a few millimetres to over long, with females usually somewhat larger than the males. Almost all species in the family are ectoparasites on fish, with a few on invertebrates or amphibians. They have a flattened, oval body, which is almost entirely covered by a wide carapace. Their compound eyes are prominent, and the mouthparts and the first pair of antennae are modified to form a hooked, spiny proboscis armed with suckers, as an adaptation to parasitic life. They have four pairs of thoracic appendages, which are used to swim when not attached to the host. They leave their hosts for up to three weeks to mate and lay eggs, and reattach behind the fish's operculum, where they feed on mucus and sloughed-off scales, or pierce the skin and feed on the internal fluids. The eggs hatch into parasitic postnauplius larvae. Classification The 173 recognised species are divided among six genera. The centres of diversity are the Afrotropical and Neotropical realms.

Aman was created in 1950, when the Intelligence Department was spun off from the IDF's General Staff (the Intelligence Department itself was composed largely of former members of the Haganah Intelligence Service). Aman is an independent service, and not part of the ground forces, Navy or the Air Force. It is one of the main entities (and the largest component) of the Israeli Intelligence Community, along with Mossad and Shin Bet. It is currently headed by Major General Tamir Heiman. It includes the cyber warfare branch Unit 8200 and the training course Havatzalot Program. Its special forces unit is Sayeret Matkal. Roles and jurisdiction Intelligence Corps badge. Old logo of Aman The IDF's Intelligence Corps (◊ó◊ô◊ú ◊î◊û◊ï◊ì◊ô◊¢◊ô◊ü), abbreviated as Haman (◊ó◊û\\"◊ü) and headed by a brigadier general, has been detached from Aman since the Yom Kippur War, but remains under its jurisdiction. In April 2000, the newest IDF corps was founded (the IDF's fifth land corps), the Combat Intelligence Collection Corps (◊ó◊ô◊ú ◊û◊ï◊ì◊ô◊¢◊ô◊ü ◊î◊©◊ì◊î), abbreviated as Modash (◊û◊ï◊ì\\"◊©). It was designed to fulfill some of Aman's former combat intelligence functions, and is also headed by a Brigadier General. Although it falls under the operational jurisdiction of the GOC Army Headquarters, it also falls under Aman's professional jurisdiction. In 1976, according to the Lexicon of National Security, some of Aman's principal roles consisted of: #Intelligence evaluation for security policy, military planning and \\"fluid security policy,\\" and the dissemination of intelligence to IDF and governmental bodies. #Field security at the level of the General Staff (today, Matkal: ◊û◊ò◊õ\\"◊ú), and the training and operation of field security in general (all levels). #The operation of military censorship. #Direction and operation of the 'Collection Agencies'. #Drawing maps; providing the direction and supervision for the dissemination of maps. #The development of 'special measures' for intelligence work. #The development of intelligence doctrine in the realms of research, collection, and field security. #Staff responsibility for military attach√©s overseas. History During the founding of the state of Israel, the Haganah military organization was primarily responsible for gathering intelligence, or one of its elite units, the Scherut Jediot (secret service), or Shai. Prime Minister David Ben Gurion commissioned the Shai in the late 1940s to create a secret service structure for Israel. Shai member Re‚Äôuwen Schiloach established based on Shai four independent services: Aman and Schin Bet and also the foreign intelligence service Machleket Hacheker and the Institute for Illegal Immigration Mossad le-Alija Bet (defunct in March 1952). In addition, in mid-1949 Shiloah created the Committee of Secret Service chiefs as a super-ordinate body. From 1963 the international secret service was officially called \\"Institute for Intelligence Service and Special Tasks\\" (ha-Mosad le-Modi'in u-le-Tafkidim Mejuhadim), short Mossad. An offshoot of the Department of Defense was also the lesser-known Lakam technology intelligence agency. The existence of which was long considered a state secret. It was used to obtain scientific and technological information. In the 1980s, however, the Lakam lost much of its previous importance. One of the biggest defeats of the Israeli secret services was caused by the Aman in the 1950s. Defense Minister Pinhas Lavon had to resign as part of the so- called Lawon affair. Aman-led \\"Operation Susannah\\" was intended to attack western facilities in Egypt by Israeli agents and saboteurs. The aim was to disrupt the good ties between the United States and the Egyptian head of state, Gamal Abdel Nasser. The US should believe that the Egyptian state is powerless against religious organizations. Egypt managed uncover the agent circle. Ten members were sentenced in a show trial in January 1955, two of them to death. Lawon resigned a month later, then Benjamin Gibli, then Aman's director, two weeks later. Ultimately, Head of State Ben Gurion resigned in 1963 after being worn down by ongoing discussions. Units Aman consists of the following subordinate and professionally subordinate units: =Staff units= *Intelligence Corps =Collection units= :*Camp 1391 *Unit 8200 * *Sayeret Matkal =Research= *Research Department =Information security= *Information Security Department *Military Censor [Part of Aman, but an entirely independent unit, not subordinate to any military or political level, only to parliamentary and judicial oversight] =Other units= *Supervision Department *External Relations Department *Ro'im Rachok *Unit 81 *Havatzalot Program =Professionally subordinate units= *Air Intelligence Group: the intelligence unit of the Israeli Air Force *Naval Intelligence Division: the intelligence unit of the Israeli Sea Corps *Combat Intelligence Collection Corps: the intelligence unit of GOC Army Headquarters *The intelligence units of the Regional Commands: Central, Northern, Southern and Home Front Commands *Center for Consciousness Operations: a psychological warfare unit of the Operations Directorate =List of directors= The head of Aman is the senior intelligence officer in the IDF and engages in intelligence decision and policy-making at the same level as the heads of the Shabak and the Mossad: together, they form the three highest-ranking, co-equal heads of the Israeli Intelligence Community, focusing on the military, domestic (including the Palestinian territories), and foreign intelligence fronts respectively. On June 10, 2005, then-IDF's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Dan Halutz, in a move viewed as surprising, announced that Major General Aharon Zeevi-Farkash would be replaced by Major General Amos Yadlin. Yadlin, who had been serving as the IDF's military attach√© in Washington, D.C., was a combat pilot, former head of the air force's Air Intelligence Directorate, and Halutz's deputy. Yadlin was appointed as Aman Director on January 5, 2006, with Zeevi-Farkash having served an extended term.

The Estorick Collection was founded by American sociologist and writer Eric Estorick (1913‚Äì93), who began to collect art when he moved to England after the Second World War. Estorick and his German-born English wife Salome (1920‚Äì1989) discovered Umberto Boccioni‚Äôs book Futurist Painting and Sculpture (1914) while they were on their honeymoon in 1947. Before the end of their trip they visited erstwhile Futurist Mario Sironi in Milan and bought most of the contents of his studio, including hundreds of drawings. They built up the collection mainly between 1953 and 1958. The collection was shown in several temporary exhibitions, including one at the Tate Gallery in London in 1956, and the key works were on long-term loan to the Tate from 1966 to 1975. The Estoricks rejected offers to purchase their collection from the Italian government and museums in the United States and Israel. Six months prior to his death Eric Estorick set up the Eric and Salome Estorick Foundation, to which he donated all his Italian works. The Estorick Collection moved to its current premises in Northampton Lodge, previously the home and office of Sir Basil Spence, the British architect, a converted Grade II-listed Georgian house, in 1998. The project was supported by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The core of the collection is its Futurist works, but it also includes figurative art and sculpture dating from 1890 to the 1950s. It features paintings by Futurism's main protagonists: Giacomo Balla, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carr√†, Gino Severini, Luigi Russolo and Ardengo Soffici, and works by Giorgio de Chirico, Amedeo Modigliani, Giorgio Morandi, Mario Sironi and Marino Marini. In addition to the main displays from the permanent collection, the Estorick Collection organises temporary exhibitions.

It is considered the first true lace because it was the first meant to be stitched alone, and not first onto a woven fabric. It is a closely related needle lace to reticella, and their designs have many similarities when compared side-by-side. However, the punto in aria was an important improvement on the reticella method, and was a breakthrough in needle lace design.  History  The reticella was the design that was the catalyst of the transition between fabrics made into lace by subtracting threads after needling, and lace made from scratch without fabric support. The reticella design required one to draw out threads after stitching onto fabric. As that design evolved, an increasing number of threads required withdrawing. Eventually, so many threads were drawn-out that the foundation became very flimsy and lace makers devised a new framework that did not require original foundation fabric. This came to be known as punto in aria.  Design  Punto in aria retains many of the characteristics of reticella but also is able to go beyond the geometric framework. The lace makers devised a linen and parchment base for their work. This base consisted of two or three layers of fabric with the parchment pattern on top. The layers were then basted together. The pattern was then laid over with a gimp which was basted down through the pattern and layers of support fabric. When the lace was finished, the basting stitches were cut between the layers thus leaving only the lace.

It is characterized by rich and symmetrical detail, and a reliance on symbols associated with King Louis XIV of France, such as suns, sunflowers, fleurs-de- lys, and crowns.  History  During the 1660s, King Louis XIV of France was spending extravagant sums on lace from the Republic of Venice, particularly a type known as point de Venise, to the dismay of his finance minister, Jean- Baptiste Colbert. In order to redirect this spending into the French economy, Colbert set up a number of official royal lace factories, which were to produce a type of lace he named point de France. He worked with the French ambassador to Venice to tempt needle-workers from Venice, Italy, and Flanders to emigrate to France, prompting the Doge of Venice to declare that defection to France by needle-workers was a treasonous act punishable by execution or assassination. It is unclear whether this threat was ever carried out; regardless, enough Venetian needle-workers emigrated that the French quickly learned to produce high-quality lace. Point de France was popularized by the clergy, who used it for the ornaments of their rochets, a type of clerical vestment. Most surviving pieces from the 16th and 17th centuries are now in museums.

It started as an independent trade from 1973 to 2006 until VNU Media took over in 2006 and became a relaunched sister trade to Billboard, until its final issue in 2009. History The company was founded in 1973 and published its first issue on October 5 of that year. Founders included Bob Wilson and Robert Kardashian. The publication was issued in a weekly print edition, and it also issued a bi- annual Directory. R&R; published its print edition from 1973 through August 4, 2006. Its weekly columns and features were intended to inform and educate the radio industry by each format, in addition to format-specific charts based on radio airplay. The charts eventually became populated by data from Mediabase, a company that monitors and tracks radio airplay in cities across the U.S. From 1987 to 2002 it was owned by Westwood One, which collaborated with Radio & Records to use its charts and format editors for WWOne's syndicated radio programs. On July 6, 2006, VNU, the parent company of Billboard and its sister publication Billboard Radio Monitor, announced the acquisition of Radio & Records, and a month later on August 1, officially took over ownership. R&R; then fell under the operations of the Billboard Information Group. On July 12, 2006, VNU announced that Radio & Records and Billboard Radio Monitor would be integrated into one publication called R&R.; The new R&R; published charts based on Nielsen BDS data. Both Billboard Radio Monitor and R&R; ceased publication as separate trades, with Monitor issuing its last edition on July 14, 2006 after 13 years, and R&R; ending their 33-year run as an independent trade with its August 4, 2006 edition. Radio & Records was relaunched as a magazine under new owners VNU Media on August 11, 2006, as \\"R&R;\\". The company, which has since changed its name to The Nielsen Company, currently publishes 6 daily email publications, 35 weekly email publications, and 4 websites, each serving segments of the radio and records industries. Like Billboard, which is also owned by VNU Media, Radio & Records used data from Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems to develop the charts showing which records were played each week by leading radio stations. Prior to the merger, Radio & Records had used monitored charts and playlists from Mediabase. The format charts used during its run included CHR/Top 40, Rhythmic, Gospel, Urban, Country, Adult Contemporary, Rock, Christian, Latin and Smooth Jazz. In 2000 Radio & Records entered the Spanish music business purchasing weekly trade publication Radio Y Musica and Radio y Musica Convention from Alfredo Alonso. On June 3, 2009, R&R; announced that they were immediately ceasing operations after the release of the 6/5/09 issue.

The picture was produced and directed by Frank Tashlin, with a screenplay adapted by Tashlin and Herbert Baker from an uncredited 1955 novel, Do Re Mi by Garson Kanin. Filmed in DeLuxe Color, the production was originally intended as a vehicle for the American sex symbol Jayne Mansfield, with a satirical subplot involving teenagers and rock 'n' roll music.\\"The Girl Can't Help It (1956)\\", original print information, Turner Classic Movies (TCM), Atlanta, Georgia. Retrieved September 6, 2019. The unintended result has been called the \\"most potent\\" celebration of rock music ever captured on film. The original music score, including the title song performed by Little Richard, was by Bobby Troup, with an additional credit to Ray Anthony for the tune \\"Big Band Boogie\\". Tom Ewell had portrayed Marilyn Monroe's leading man in The Seven Year Itch the previous year. Plot A slot machine mobster, Marty \\"Fats\\" Murdock (Edmond O'Brien), wants his blonde girlfriend, Jerri Jordan (Jayne Mansfield), to be a singing star, despite her seeming lack of talent. He hires alcoholic press agent Tom Miller (Tom Ewell) to promote Jordan, both because of his past success with the career of singer Julie London (a fiction of the script) and because he never makes sexual advances towards his female clients. Miller sets to work by showing Jordan off around numerous night spots; his machinations arouse interest in Jordan and soon offers of contracts follow. However, Miller realizes that Jordan really just wants to be a homemaker and tries to persuade Murdock not to push Jordan into a show- business career. He thinks he's succeeded when he reveals to Murdock that Jordan's singing is so bad it shatters light bulbs, but Murdock suggests that Jordan would be perfect for a song he composed while in prison, \\"Rock Around the Rock Pile\\" (a parody of Rock Around the Clock). Miller reluctantly records Jordan performing the part of a prison siren in Murdock's song and heads to Chicago to promote it to Wheeler (John Emery), a former mob rival of Murdock who now has a monopoly over the jukebox industry. Suspicious of Miller's reluctance to promote Jordan and of the obvious attraction between Miller and Jordan, Murdock has his associate Mousie (Henry Jones) wiretap a phone call between the pair. Feeling pity for them, Mousie edits out the romantic portions of their conversations and convinces Murdock that their relationship is strictly business. In Chicago, Wheeler is impressed by the song and Jordan's voice and offers to sign both Jordan and the songwriter. However, when Miller reveals that the songwriter is Murdock, Wheeler throws him out of his office and vows never to play the song. A furious Murdock bullies bar owners into buying jukeboxes from him instead and successfully promotes his and Jordan's song. To prevent Murdock from stealing his business, Wheeler arranges to have Murdock assassinated at the rock show where Jordan will be making her debut. On his way to the show, Murdock confesses to Mousie that he doesn't want to marry Jordan. Mousie confesses that he altered the tape of Jordan and Miller's phone call and encourages Murdock to let Jordan marry Miller. Backstage at the show, Jordan confesses her love to Miller and they kiss. Jordan also admits that she is a talented singer, who lied because she did not want a show business career; she goes on stage and performs a song about her love for Miller. When Murdock arrives, Miller declares to him that he and Jordan are in love; the delighted Murdock surprises Miller by shaking his hand and offering to be the best man. Before Miller and Murdock can tell Jordan the good news, Wheeler's assassins shoot at Murdock. Miller fights them off and shoves Murdock on stage to perform his song, reasoning that the assassins won't shoot Murdock in front of so many witnesses. Wheeler arrives and, impressed by the audience's response to Murdock, calls off the assassination and signs Murdock instead. The film ends with Miller and Jordan kissing on their honeymoon, as Murdock and Mousie perform on a TV show in the background.

Bosley Crowther of the New York Times noted that Jayne Mansfield's performance was underwhelming, stating, \\"Her range, at this stage, appears restricted to a weak imitation of Marilyn Monroe.\\" =Accolades= The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals ‚Äì Nominated Influence on rock music The movie's influence on rock music is significant. The film reached Liverpool, England, in the early summer of 1957. The cameo performances of early rock 'n' roll stars such as Little Richard, Eddie Cochran, and Gene Vincent and His Bluecaps fascinated a 16-year-old John Lennon by showing him, for the first time, his \\"worshipped\\" American rock 'n' roll stars as living humans and thus further inspiring him to pursue his own rock 'n' roll dream.Norman (2008), p. 99. On July 6, 1957, 15-year-old Paul McCartney was introduced to Lennon after the latter had performed at a village church garden party with his skiffle group The Quarrymen. McCartney demonstrated his musical prowess to Lennon by performing \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\" in a manner similar to how he had seen it played by Eddie Cochran in The Girl Can't Help It. This led to Lennon inviting McCartney to join the group. McCartney talks about the movie in the documentary series The Beatles Anthology.Norman (2008), p. 107. On September 18, 1968, The Beatles interrupted recording \\"Birthday\\" at Abbey Road Studios so they could go back to Paul McCartney's house to watch the British TV premiere of the film. Also, some film buffs have pointed to Elvis Presley's famous performance of the song \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" in MGM's movie of the same name (often cited as the first music video), released one year after The Girl Can't Help It, as bearing a remarkable resemblance to the theme and performance of a song called \\"Rock Around the Rockpile\\" from the earlier movie. In that performance, Edmond O'Brien plays a character who seeks to escape an assassination attempt by jumping on stage and singing the lyrics, \\"rock, rock, rock around the rockpile,\\" while backed up by The Ray Anthony Band wearing striped inmate uniforms. O'Brien, then 42 years old, even awkwardly attempts some of the hip- swiveling and leg motions for which Elvis had already became famous, as he had appeared already 10 times, to cumulative audiences in excess of 180 million viewers, and on national television, before and during the filming of The Girl Can't Help It, the production of which commenced in mid-September 1956. Other film buffs point to the famous acrobatic dancer and Presley contemporary, as well as MGM star, Russ Tamblyn (Seven Brides for Seven Brothers), who visited Presley at his suite at the Knickerboker Hotel on the night before the filming of the \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" scene. Presley had had trouble that day at the rehearsals in interpreting what the MGM choreographer, Alex Romero, demanded of him, and Tamblyn's advice at the suite that night helped him perform the first part of that dance sequence (which, incidentally, was witnessed by the then-MGM megastar Gene Kelly). In fact, The Girl Can't Help It's producers had sought to enlist Presley, whose manager, Colonel Tom Parker, however, had demanded too much money. Two uncredited composers on The Girl Can't Help It, Hugo Friedhofer and Lionel Newman, had also composed music for the Elvis classic movie, Love Me Tender, in the same year, 1956.

It entered terminal decline at the end of the 19th century with changes in fashion and the development of cheaper, machine-made lace. Alen√ßon needle lace (1760-1775), MoMu-collection, Antwerp Dino making survived on a small scale and the technique was preserved by Carmelite nuns in Alen√ßon. In 1976 a National Lace Workshop was established in the town to ensure that this lace- making technique survives. There is a permanent exhibition of lace and a display showing how it is made in the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts et de la Dentelle, located in the town centre and adjoining the Workshop. The workshops themselves are open to the public only on certain days of the year. UNESCO recognised the unusual craftsmanship of this lace and added it to its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in November 2010.

They all were born in Trujillo, Spain. They were four brothers: * Juan Pizarro (d. 1536) first illegitimate son of Captain Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodr√≠guez de Aguilar and Mar√≠a Alonso * Francisco Pizarro (d. 1541) illegitimate son of Captain Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodr√≠guez de Aguilar and Francisca Gonz√°lez * Gonzalo Pizarro (d. 1548) second illegitimate son of Captain Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodr√≠guez de Aguilar and Mar√≠a Alonso * Hernando Pizarro (d. 1578) legitimate son of Captain Gonzalo Pizarro y Rodr√≠guez de Aguilar and Isabel de Vargas All of them played a major part in the capture (1531‚Äì38) and rule of the Inca Empire. However, after the death of legal governor Francisco, their legitimate claims were practically forfeit. Juan had died during the ten-month-long siege of Cuzco and Hernando was sent back as envoy to Spain and imprisoned in 1540, after accusations of corruption and tax evasion pointed towards the Pizarro administration. After Francisco's assassination in 1541, power was usurped by Crist√≥bal Vaca de Castro as new governor of \\"New Castile\\". In 1544 the king of Spain, who had also granted Francisco governorship in 1528, sent his own envoy Blasco N√∫√±ez Vela, as viceroy of Peru. Blasco imprisoned Castro but was the very same year detained and later killed on the behalf of Gonzalo Pizarro, who gathered his supporters and seized much of Peru. When Blasco's successor, Pedro de la Gasca defeated and had Gonzalo executed in 1548, the reign of the Pizarro brothers had definitely passed. The family group involved in the conquest of the Incas also included a maternal half-brother of Francisco, * Francisco Mart√≠n de Alc√°ntara and a cousin of the Pizarro brothers, * Pedro Pizarro Hernando had two full sisters, In√©s Pizarro y de Vargas and Isabel Pizarro y de Vargas, who married Gonzalo de Tapia.

From 1938 to 1950 Schonfield examined various aspects of the project, including questions of international law. Schonfield came up with the idea of a body of persons from different countries which would have relations with the governments of other countries, without that organisation holding any territory itself. When the United Nations was formed, Schonfield wrote to the Secretary-General and to all the states party to the charter of his desire to form his Mondcivitan Republic. In the summer of 1951, a General Assembly of the organisation's members was held in Paris, which appointed a Secretariat as the acting administration with offices in London. By 1952 the organisation had members in 14 countries, by 1954 in 25 countries and by 1955 in 30 countries. The second General Assembly in 1953 set up a commission to draft the text of the constitution of the organisation. Following amendments at the third General Assembly in 1955, the organisation's provisional Constitution was approved for adoption. In the same year humanitarian activities were initiated by the creation of the World Service Trust as a specialised agency of the organisation.

The organisation was to consist of all its members at any given time, without regard for colour or ethnic origin. In its political expression it was a free and self-governing organisation and world community. The new organisation expressed the goal of world unity and human fraternity. The idea was that the organisation should advocate for international reconciliation and the resolution of international problems and conflicts. The loyalty it demanded was higher than that given to any state, requiring in the individual full dedication to the principles and purposes of the new nation, yet at the initial stage without forfeiting state citizenship. For the members, state citizenship was to be always secondary to membership within the organisation. Any member was expected to be primarily concerned with the affairs and policies of the organisation. Taking part in war, aggression of oppression was strictly prohibited and the member was supposed to be prepared to suffer the penalties. All members were expected to live and abide by a set of seven principles: * No-one is an Enemy * No-one is a Foreigner * Service to All * Complete Impartiality * Work for Peace * True Democracy * Equity and Justice The Republic With members in 33 countries it was decided in 1956 that the Mondcivitan Republic should be proclaimed in being de facto and that all governments should be advised accordingly and furnished with a copy of the constitution. A Constituent Assembly of the organisation's members was convened at the Temple of Peace, Cardiff, headquarters of the United Nations Association in Wales. The organisation's constitution was adopted on August 29 and the flag of the organisation hoisted over the building. A council was elected to prepare the way for parliamentary government. In 1958 a democratic election was held giving opportunity to all members in the countries where they resided to elect deputies to the first parliament which met in Vienna in May 1959. Up to this time the organisation had used the title, \\"Commonwealth of World Citizens\\" which was abandoned in favour of \\"The Mondcivitan Republic\\". Hugh Schonfield, the pioneer of the enterprise, was elected acting president and the organisation chose an executive committee headed by a young member, Donald Hanby who was referred to as the prime minister. In 1963, the organisation held its second parliament. The term of this body was to be for five years. In accordance with the constitution, a presidium of five was elected under the name of the Supreme Council, each member of which would hold the office of president for one year in turn. Those elected, in the order of their presidency, were Frieda Bacon, Justo Priesto, Nguyen-Huu, Anthony Brooke and Hugh J. Schonfield, the last named to take office at the end of August 1967. The post of prime minister was relinquished and replaced under the constitution with that of commissioner- general and Donald Hanby was elected to that office. At this time, the International Arbitration League, founded at the beginning of the 20th century by the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Sir William Randal Cremer, decided that its work could best be continued by the Mondcivitan Republic and the two organisations fused. The work of the World Service Trust continued and a housing agency, the Cremer Housing Association, was formed, which later provided new premises for use by the organisation. In 1971, the provisional constitution was suspended to make way for formulating a full constitution. To enable the organisation to ensure the best means of governance, an executive council was appointed to take full responsibility for the organisation's affairs in the interim period. It was hoped that a full constitution and self- government could be achieved by 1975, but this did not happen. Projects In 1972 Hugh Schonfield's book about the fundamental ideas behind the organisation, The Politics of God, was published and received much interest, particularly because it had been preceded by the best-selling The Passover Plot, which had created much discussion and aroused interest in the concept of Messianism. The Community school project was started as an experiment by the organisation's membership. It was intended to provide a viable alternative to the prevalent educational concepts, with primary aim to give each child freedom, experience, resources and love. It was believed that this should take place in, and be directly concerned with, the community as a whole, encouraging children to take an active interest in serving and changing the community for the betterment of the whole of mankind. Various methods of achieving these aims were implemented. The school was supported by donations from members and charged no fees. Many of the children were \\"problem\\" children from the neighbourhood of the school who went on to lead productive lives. The World Service Trust The World Service Trust was founded in 1955 as a special agency of the organisation for the purpose of giving impartial aid to people and countries in circumstances of poverty, famine, disease and epidemics, as well as natural disasters. The secondary organisation was also designed to assist education and improve standards of living. In 1990 the secondary organisation became a foundation and was renamed \\"The Hugh and Helene Schonfield World Service Trust\\". The Schonfields contributed to it financially. The organisation fell into decline following the 1980s. Its archives are now deposited with the Bishopsgate Institute in London. Its activities became more centred in Germany as the community initiated by Wilhelm Haller felt a more decentralised and less bureaucratic approach was necessary. A new initiative was started in 2004 with the founding of the 'International Leadership and Business Society', intended to encourage the application of the original Mondcivitan principles in business and everyday life. The Hugh & Helene Schonfield World Service Trust continued to work particularly with its responsibility for the archiving and publicising of the work of the late Hugh J. Schonfield and research into the concepts of Messianism, Humanitism and Servant-Nationhood and methods to find their practical realisation. In 2014 a revival of the movement was started in an attempt to find a current interpretation. This has led to the establishment of a Facebook page.

Foreign diplomats based in Pakistan escorted to the site by the Pakistan Army noted that the plane may have crossed the border. They also believed that India's reaction was unjustified.

Hosted on Embassy of India in Washington webpage According to them, the Pakistani claim was untenable since the primary role of the Atlantic is for operations over the sea and that to carry out a training flight over land deep inside foreign territory was an indication of its use in a surveillance role. India displayed part of the wreckage of the Pakistani naval aircraft at New Delhi airport the next day. Pakistan stated that the wreckage was removed from its side of the border by Indian helicopters. While Pakistan said that the plane was unarmed and the debris was within Pakistani territory, India maintained that warnings had been given to the Atlantic and that its flight trajectory meant it could have fallen on either side of the border. According to the Indian version of events, the MiGs tried to escort it to a nearby Indian base, when the Pakistani aircraft turned abruptly and tried to make a dash for the border; it was only then that it was fired upon. India claimed that the debris was found in a radius of 2 km on either side of the border and that the intrusion took place 10 km inside the Kori Creek, which is Indian territory. Pakistan requested that the matter be taken up in the UN. Indian officials claimed that there had been previous violations in the area and pointed out that in the previous year a Pakistani unmanned surveillance aircraft had intruded 150 km inside the Indian border, coming close to the Bhuj air base before the IAF spotted it and brought it down with several missiles.Creek Crisis by Vijay Jung Thapa and Aahid Hussain and Uday Mahurkar 23 August 1999 India Today Retrieved on 23 July 2007 Indian analysts state \\"flare-ups\\" in the Rann of Kutch region were routine, and despite bilateral agreements, both India and Pakistan had conducted air intrusions in the past.

No damage was recorded as the missiles miss the target. The IAF thus aborted their mission and could safely return. The helicopter carrying the journalists also returned without any damage. Following this, and the rising tensions in the area coupled by the fact that the Sir Creek was a disputed territory, both the countries' militaries near the Rann of Kutch and nearby were put on high alert.

He had served in both the American Expeditionary Force in World War I and in Europe in World War II. He headed the office of legislative liaison for the Department of Defense between 1948 and his retirement in 1949. He retired with the rank of major general, and became superintendent of Staunton Military Academy. Persons was called back to active duty as a special assistant to General Dwight D. Eisenhower at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe from 1951‚Äì1952 and was active on behalf of Eisenhower's presidential campaign in 1952. He became a deputy assistant to the president in 1953 and then was made an assistant to the president in 1958. He served throughout the Eisenhower presidency, handling congressional liaison before he replaced Sherman Adams in 1958 as, effectively, Eisenhower's chief of staff. Following the 1960 presidential election, Persons was heavily involved as Eisenhower's representative in the transition of government between the Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy administrations. He met frequently with Clark Clifford, President-elect Kennedy's transition representative, to work out the details for a smooth transfer of government.

Scientific synonyms include Bistorta vivipara and Polygonum viviparum. It is common all over the high Arctic through Europe, North America, and temperate and tropical Asia. Its range stretches further south in high mountainous areas such as the Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees, Caucasus, and the Tibetan Plateau. Taxonomy Molecular phylogenetic work has demonstrated that the genus Bistorta represents a distinct lineage within the family Polygonaceae. The genus Bistorta contains at least 42 accepted species. Description Alpine bistort flower detail Alpine bistort is a perennial herb that grows to tall. It has a thick rhizomatous rootstock and an erect, unbranched, hairless stem. The leaves are hairless on the upper surfaces, but hairy and greyish-green below. The basal ones are longish- elliptical with long stalks and rounded bases; the upper ones are few and are linear and stalkless. The tiny flowers are white or pink in the upper part of the spike with five perianth segments, eight stamens with purple anthers and three fused carpels. The lower ones are replaced by bulbils. Flowers rarely produce viable seeds and reproduction is normally by the bulbils, which are small bulb-like structures that develop in the axils of the leaves and may develop into new plants. Very often, a small leaf develops when the bulbil is still attached to the mother plant. The bulbils are rich in starch and are a preferred food for rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus) and reindeer; they are also occasionally used by Arctic people. Alpine bistort flowers in June and July. Habitat Alpine bistort grows in many different plant communities, very often in abundance. Typical habitats include moist short grassland, yards, the edges of tracks, and nutrient-rich fens. As with many other alpine plants, Alpine bistort is slow-growing and produces embryonic buds one year that grow and open a few years after their formation, with an individual leaf or inflorescence taking three to four years to reach maturity from the time the buds are formed. Mycorrhiza Alpine bistort has been shown to form an ectomycorrhizal root symbiosis with fungi.  Uses  The roots of the plant are eaten in Russia, especially by the Samoyed peoples.

Description Amphionides grows to a length of . Morphologically, Amphionides is somewhat unusual, with many body parts being reduced or absent. For example, it has only one pair of mouthparts ‚Äì the maxillae ‚Äì the mandibles and maxillules being vestigial. Males and females differ in the form of the antennae, and also by the presence in males of the eighth thoracic appendage, albeit in a reduced form. This is the site of the male gonopore (the female's gonopore is on the sixth thoracic appendage). The first pleopod of the female is greatly enlarged and almost encloses the enlarged carapace. This is assumed to be a chamber in which the eggs are fertilised and retained until hatching. The more streamlined carapace and pleopods of the male make it more hydrodynamic, so fewer males are caught than females. Distribution and ecology A. reynaudii has a cosmopolitan distribution in the world's tropical oceans. It is planktonic, inhabiting waters less than deep as a larva, but more often at depths of as an adult. Classification Originally described from its larvae, Amphionides was originally thought to be a shrimp. The adult form was not observed until 1969 to be that described by Carl Wilhelm Erich Zimmer in 1904, and only in 1973 was Amphionides placed in its own order by Donald I. Williamson. The specific epithet reynaudii was given by Henri Milne-Edwards in honour of a friend of his, possibly Count Fran√ßois Dominique Reynaud de Montlosier.

His Sey√¢hatn√¢me thus appears as a work of 17th-century light literature, which was intelligible to a wide circle thanks to the mixed use of the colloquial Turkish of the 17th century with occasional borrowings of phrases and expressions from the ornate style. Such attempt to appeal to a wide audience may explain the author's lack of concern for historical truth. He even recorded certain occurrences as though he had seen or experienced them himself even though a close examination reveals that he knows of them only from hearsay or literary sources, which he does not cite.Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. \\"EwliyƒÅ ƒåelebi.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.

Northwestern University. 23 May 2016 In spite of these reservations, Evliya's Sey√¢hatn√¢me offers a wealth of information on cultural history, folklore, and geography. The significance of the work lies in the fact that it reflects the mental approach of the 17th century Ottoman Turkish intellectuals in their attitudes to the non-Muslim Occident, and sheds light on the administration and internal organization of the Ottoman empire of that time.Mordtmann, J.H.; Duda, H.W.. \\"EwliyƒÅ ƒåelebi.\\" Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.

They are characterised by having the carapace fused to all thoracic segments, and by the possession of stalked eyes. Orders Eucarida is a diverse and abundant group, comprising the following four orders: =Euphausiacea= The members of the Euphausiacea are commonly called krill and are all marine shrimp-like species whose pleopods (abdominal appendages) function as swimmerets. They swarm and mostly feed on plankton. This group is composed of only 90 species, some of which are the most abundant species on the planet; in fact, it is estimated that the biomass of the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba' is 500 million tons. =Decapoda= Decapoda is a group with 15,000 species which have 5 pairs of thoracopods and a well-developed carapace that covers the gills (which are exposed in krill). They include lobsters, crabs, shrimp and prawns. The decapods are further subdivided on the basis of the gill structure into two suborders Dendrobranchiata (prawns) and Pleocyemata, which is further subdivided into several infraorders, such as the Caridea (true shrimp), the Stenopodidea (boxer shrimp) and the Anomura and the Brachyura (crabs) and so forth. =Amphionidacea= In addition, there is an enigmatic eucarid species, Amphionides reynaudii, which is the sole representative of its order, but due to the loss of several features resulting from its small size, its classification has been unclear. =Angustidontida= Lastly, there is an extinct order that contains only one family, Angustidontidae, which in turn contains two genera, Angustidontus and Schramidontus. Phylogeny The phylogeny of the Malacostraca is debated. In particular, the monophyly of Eucarida is also under question: * Monophyletic: many argue that the Eucarida group is a clade, sister to the Peracarida clade or to the basal Malacostraca. or to Mysida (paraphyletic Schizopoda) * Paraphyletic: some have proposed a paraphyletic Eucarida forming a clade with a nested Peracarida. * Polyphyletic: some have grouped Euphausiacea with Mysida to form the Schizopoda, or the Euphausiacea with the Hoplocarida, with Decapoda basal to the Peracarida.

In simple terms, problems in this class have efficient algorithms that can find an answer within some fixed multiplicative factor of the optimal answer. An approximation algorithm is called an f(n)-approximation algorithm for input size n if it can be proven that the solution that the algorithm finds is at most a multiplicative factor of f(n) times worse than the optimal solution. Here, f(n) is called the approximation ratio. Problems in APX are those with algorithms for which the approximation ratio f(n) is a constant c. The approximation ratio is conventionally stated greater than 1. In the case of minimization problems, f(n) is the found solution's score divided by the optimum solution's score, while for maximization problems the reverse is the case. For maximization problems, where an inferior solution has a smaller score, f(n) is sometimes stated as less than 1; in such cases, the reciprocal of f(n) is the ratio of the score of the found solution to the score of the optimum solution. A problem is said to have a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) if for every multiplicative factor of the optimum worse than 1 there is a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem to within that factor. Unless P = NP there exist problems that are in APX but without a PTAS, so the class of problems with a PTAS is strictly contained in APX. One such problem is the bin packing problem.  APX-hardness and APX-completeness  A problem is said to be APX-hard if there is a PTAS reduction from every problem in APX to that problem, and to be APX-complete if the problem is APX-hard and also in APX. As a consequence of P ‚â† NP ‚áí PTAS ‚â† APX, if P ‚â† NP is assumed, no APX-hard problem has a PTAS. In practice, reducing one problem to another to demonstrate APX-completeness is often done using other reduction schemes, such as L-reductions, which imply PTAS reductions. = Examples = One of the simplest APX-complete problems is MAX-3SAT-3, a variation of the boolean satisfiability problem. In this problem, we have a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form where each variable appears at most 3 times, and we wish to know the maximum number of clauses that can be simultaneously satisfied by a single assignment of true/false values to the variables. Other APX-complete problems include: * Max independent set in bounded-degree graphs (here, the approximation ratio depends on the maximum degree of the graph, but is constant if the max degree is fixed). * Min vertex cover. The complement of any maximal independent set must be a vertex cover. * Min dominating set in bounded-degree graphs. * The travelling salesman problem when the distances in the graph satisfy the conditions of a metric. TSP is NPO-complete in the general case. * The token reconfiguration problem, via L-reduction from set cover.  Related complexity classes  PTAS = PTAS (polynomial time approximation scheme) consists of problems that can be approximated to within any constant factor besides 1 in time that is polynomial to the input size, but the polynomial depends on such factor. This class is a subset of APX. = APX-intermediate = Unless P = NP, there exist problems in APX that are neither in PTAS nor APX-complete. Such problems can be thought of as having a hardness between PTAS problems and APX-complete problems, and may be called APX-intermediate. The bin packing problem is thought to be APX-intermediate. Despite not having a known PTAS, the bin packing problem has several \\"asymptotic PTAS\\" algorithms, which behave like a PTAS when the optimum solution is large, so intuitively it may be easier than problems that are APX- hard. One other example of a potentially APX-intermediate problem is min edge coloring. = f(n)-APX = One can also define a family of complexity classes f(n)-APX, where f(n)-APX contains problems with a polynomial time approximation algorithm with a O(f(n)) approximation ratio. One can analogously define f(n)-APX-complete classes; some such classes contain well- known optimization problems. Log-APX-completeness and poly-APX-completeness are defined in terms of AP-reductions rather than PTAS-reductions; this is because PTAS-reductions are not strong enough to preserve membership in Log- APX and Poly-APX, even though they suffice for APX. Log-APX-complete, consisting of the hardest problems that can be approximated efficiently to within a factor logarithmic in the input size, includes min dominating set when degree is unbounded. Poly-APX-complete, consisting of the hardest problems that can be approximated efficiently to within a factor polynomial in the input size, includes max independent set in the general case. There also exist problems that are exp-APX-complete, where the approximation ratio is exponential in the input size. This may occur when the approximation is dependent on the value of numbers within the problem instance; these numbers may be expressed in space logarithmic in their value, hence the exponential factor.

His rise in the baseball broadcasting industry was fast, as he went from Class-A ball (Visalia) in 2000 to Triple-A from 2001‚Äì2003 (Pawtucket) and finally the Giants. Career with the San Francisco Giants In seventeen seasons calling Giants games, Flemming has been a part of many memorable on-air moments. On April 27, 2003, in his second ever major league broadcast, working as a fill-in for Jon Miller, Flemming broadcast the Phillies' Kevin Millwood's no-hitter against the Giants. In some ways it was an indication of the moments to come. Barry Bonds provided several of those. On May 28, 2006, Flemming had the chance for his voice to go into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum when he was set to call Barry Bonds' 715th home run, passing Babe Ruth for second place on the all-time home run list. However, as he was making the call, his microphone went dead: Flemming, unaware of the problem, continued to make the call, but all listeners heard was about ten seconds of dead air. Only Duane Kuiper's call on Fox Sports Net's broadcast was sent to the Hall of Fame.Transcript from Neil Conan's interview with Dave Flemming on the Monday, May 29, 2006 edition of Talk of the Nation on National Public Radio (NPR) News. On September 23 of the same year, during Flemming's third-inning call of a game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park, Bonds hit a home run off left-hander Chris Capuano. This was Bonds' 734th career homer (26th for the season), which broke Hank Aaron's record for National League home runs. (Aaron hit his last 21 homers as an American League player.) Eventually on August 4, 2007, Flemming was able to call Bonds' record-tying 755th home run in San Diego on the radio against the San Diego Padres. That call of #755 proved to be a notable one in a weekend of milestone moments for Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. Later that week, the New York Times sports media critic Richard Sandomir wrote of the collection of broadcasts that past weekend, \\"But the best one on radio or TV came from Dave Flemming, the Giants‚Äô radio announcer, who said clearly and excitedly on KNBR: \\"Bonds swings, 2-1 pitch. He drives one to left. Going back on the ball is Hairston. It's gone. Off the facing of the second deck. And Barry Bonds has equaled baseball's all-time home run record: 755 for Bonds.\\" On July 14, 2006, for a Friday night home game, Flemming made his television broadcast debut for the Giants. Since then, he has appeared both on NBC Sports Bay Area and KNTV during the baseball season. Other milestone broadcasts Flemming contributed to include the calls of Greg Maddux and Randy Johnson's 300th pitching victories, and the Giants' Jonathan S√°nchez's no hitter against the San Diego Padres on July 11, 2009. On November 1, 2010, during the seventh inning in Game 5 of the World Series at Rangers Ballpark, Flemming made the winning home run call that eventually sealed the Giants' win, and thus the World Series: On June 13, 2012, Flemming made the radio call of the final out of Matt Cain's perfect game, the first in the history of the Giants. In 2013 Flemming (along with Kuiper and Miller) won an Emmy for his coverage of the perfect game. Later that season, on October 28, 2012, Flemming made the call for the final out of the 2012 World Series. Flemming was again a part of the broadcasts for the 2014 postseason, and the Giants' third World Series win of the decade. In his time in San Francisco, he has won three Northern California Emmys for sports play-by-play. Stanford football and basketball Starting in 2008, Flemming began broadcasting Stanford Cardinal football and basketball. He spent three years as the voice of Stanford basketball on the radio, and six years in that capacity with Stanford football before leaving the Stanford broadcasts to concentrate on his network work. The period Flemming served as the voice of Stanford football coincided with perhaps the most successful stretch in the school's football history. Flemming's first broadcast on the Stanford radio network was the epic upset of #1 ranked USC on October 6, 2007. Over the next six seasons, Flemming was behind the microphone for the record performances of Toby Gerhart and Andrew Luck, and for three BCS bowl appearances, including a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin on January 1, 2013. National work Flemming became a regular College Basketball on ESPN announcer in 2010, after having called a couple of games for the network the previous season. He primarily works Big 10 games for ESPN, teaming with Dan Dakich and other analysts. He also calls baseball for ESPN and ESPN Radio, including MLB playoffs every year since 2013. He worked a season calling college football games for the Pac-12 Network in 2012 before shifting to College Football on ESPN in 2013. Also in 2013, Flemming began calling NBA games on ESPN Radio and contributing to Little League World Series coverage on ESPN and ABC. His LLWS work continues to this day. In 2015, Flemming began calling NFL games for ESPN Radio as well. In 2016, he began calling select Monday Night Baseball games for ESPN, as well as College Football Thursday Primetime games. Personal life Flemming and his wife, Jessica, live in San Francisco with their identical twin daughters Katie and Carter and their son David Henry.

First proclaimed under the name Bligh in 1883, the current name dates back to 1940. It is a recreational town with a number of marine and nature based attractions, including fishing, surfing and swimming. History The area which is now known as Arno Bay was opened up by pastoralists in 1863, with the area being named 'Salt Creek Cove' in these early days. Of the variety of ventures that occurred before the town was built, the sinking of 'The Arno Bay Mine' was possibly the least successful, with water halting all operations. The small town was initially proclaimed in 1882 by G. H. Ayliffe under the name of 'Bligh', after Captain William Bligh, although locals resisted the name change, continually referring to the town as 'Arno Bay' until the official name change. The town was expected to become a port and a jetty was built in 1880 in anticipation of this. The port was not huge, but nonetheless continued importing fertilisers and exporting cereal crops that were being grown in the district. By 1911, the town had grown substantially, with a school, post office, hotel and new hall established in this period. The town continued to grow as a port until the point where it was exporting 11,000 tonnes of grain in 1940. In the same year, the decision was finally made to alter the town's official name to 'Arno Bay', named after a sandhill well and not the Italian 'Arno River' as had been suggested. The period of high export came to an abrupt end in 1963 when the storage silos were built, and ocean shipping became redundant to the large trucks that were now the main mechanism of transport. This signalled the end of Arno Bay as a port, causing the population to drop slowly, eventually leading to its current position as a tourist fishing town. Geography Arno bay lies on the eastern Eyre Peninsula, and sits on the Spencer Gulf, a body of water that stretches up to Port Augusta in the north. The town itself lies on the bay of the same name, which is dominated by a mixture of white, sandy beaches, cliffs, and mangrove systems. Of particular note is 'Redbanks', a sedimentary cliff structure which is designated a geological monument by the Geological Society of Australia. The climate is much like that of Port Lincoln, which is only 118 km to South. The Mediterranean-like climate, with its hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters is typical for most of the Eyre Peninsula. Economy The town still retains it position as a minor service centre for the surrounding agricultural communities, but in nowhere near the capacity of the mid-1900s. Cereal crops and sheep are still the major produce of the inland area, as well as minor amounts of other produce. Fishing has been a minor part of the economy in the past, and recently, aquaculture has come to prominence in the bay, with Yellowtail Kingfish, mulloway and tuna held in large cages. These are farmed on 7 licenses covering 130 hectares in the bay. The aquaculture in the bay is still in development, and further expansions are expected in the future. Tourism is now one of the largest components of the town's economy, with tourists typically drawn by the areas fishing, water sport and seaside atmosphere. A boat ramp is located in the town, with whiting, snapper, tommy ruff, garfish, salmon and may other popular species caught in the bay, with most of these also available off the town jetty and beach. For boat anglers, the 'Redbanks' region has been known to produce large Mulloway and Snapper, as well as offering scenery in the form of the imposing cliffs. The local aquaculture industry also promotes tourism, with tours through facilities where finfish are raised. CommunityFacilities= For tourist facilities, Arno Bay has a beachfront caravan park, hotel, general stores, post office, playground and motor garage outlet, however no fuel station. An all-weather boat ramp, with floating pontoon and a refurbished town jetty launching facilities for boat based fishermen. A number of sporting venues and clubs include a dried-up swamp that serves as a golf course, bowling green, oval, tennis, netball, and squash courts, dirt circuit and in summer yacht racing each Sunday. =Demographics= In the , there were 428 persons (273 in the town proper) usually resident in Arno Bay: 55.4% being males and 44.6% females. Of the total population in Arno Bay there were no Indigenous persons. It was found that 18.0% of the population usually resident in Arno Bay were children aged between 0‚Äì14 years, and 29.7% were persons aged 55 years and over. The median age of persons in Arno Bay was 41 years, compared with 37 years for persons in Australia. In the Census, 92.1% of persons usually resident in Arno Bay were Australian citizens, 5.6% were born overseas and none were overseas visitors. Of those who were in permanent residence, 87.9% of them stated they were born in Australia. Other common responses were: England 1.4%, Seychelles 1.4%, New Zealand 1.2%, United States of America 0.7% and Papua New Guinea 0.7%. The most common responses for religious affiliation for persons usually resident in Arno Bay were: No Religion 29.9%, Uniting Church 24.5%, Anglican 11.7%, Catholic 9.8% and Lutheran 7.9%.

In France, 72% of HLM (95% since 2000) are houses or small buildings of 20 apartments. A Habitation √† Loyer Mod√©r√© (), generally called HLM (), is a form of low-income housing in France, Algeria, Senegal, and Quebec. It may be public or private, with rent subsidies. HLMs constitute 16% of all housing in France.10 id√©es re√ßues sur les HLM , Union sociale pour l'habitat, February 2012 There are approximately four million such residences, housing an estimated 10 million people. The standard of living in the HLM housing projects is often the lowest in the country. 72% of French HLMs built before 2001 (and 95% of those built between 2001 and 2011) are small buildings or individual houses. The average size of buildings is 20 apartments.

HLM in the area of Planoise, in Besan√ßon. The HLM system was created in 1950 in response to France's postwar housing crisis. The low level of construction during and between the two world wars, the rural exodus that had started to take place in France (directed mainly at √éle-de-France, the Paris region) and the baby boom, contributed to a deficit of an estimated four million residences. Eug√®ne Claudius-Petit, the Minister for Reconstruction and Urbanisation, promoted a scheme of massive construction of socially subsidised residences to address this problem. The new system took its foundations from the HBM (' ‚Äì \\"inexpensive housing\\") system, which had been created in 1889 and financed mainly by charitable sources rather than the state. The level of social construction did not significantly rise until minister Pierre Courant launched an ambitious plan in 1956, warranted by the increased rate of immigration from France's former colonies. Courant's plan had the goal of construction of at least 240,000 residences each year, and it was an unexpected success: from 1956 on, there were more than 300,000 new residences built annually, with a good number of them HLM. In 1964, there were 95,000 new HLM apartments. The residences were often constructed in large complexes, by ' (\\"the way of the crane\\"). The new, large apartment buildings were perfectly rectangular, to allow a crane to roll along a track and place components on both sides of the building simultaneously, saving both time and effort. The greatest increase in the number of HLMs came in the late 1960s and early 1970s, when many planned communities, or ZUP (': \\"priority urbanisation zones\\") were constructed. They were built mostly in the suburbs of Paris. A total of 195 ZUP were created, producing over two million new, mostly HLM, residences. The emphasis shifted to improving the standard of living in the residences already in existence. In 1968, for example, only 41% of the HLM apartments had toilet and sanitary facilities. By the end of the 1970s, the figure had risen to about 80%. New HLM sites, with more rooms per residence, were built in smaller cities and towns, and numerous programmes were launched to combat poverty, unemployment and delinquency in ZUP communities. In 2001, each HLM residence had, on average, 2.4 persons living in it (compared to 3.2 in 1954), four rooms (three in 1954), and 96% of all HLM apartments had toilet and sanitary facilities, compared to only 10% in 1954.  References in popular culture  HLM high-rise estates, or ', are often referenced in French popular culture, as they are known for their enduringly high rates of poverty and unemployment as well as the concentration of first and second-generation immigrants in the communities. Many, if not most, well-known French hip hop artists come from the ZUP around Paris, including Sniper, 113, and Kery James. Rohff is known for his songs portraying life in the HLMs. The Tryo hit \\"L'hymne de nos campagnes\\" begins: Si tu es n√© dans une cit√© HLM..., \\"If you were born in a HLM...\\" (Mamagubida, 1998). British Sea Power also reference HLMs in their song \\"Living Is So Easy.\\" The popular singer Renaud wrote the song \\"Dans mon HLM\\" talking about life in HLMs and describing the typical neighbors you could find there back in the eighties. In the postwar period, the HLM program was nearly synonymous with modernist high-rise apartment blocks.

The MUA was formed in 1993 with merger of the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia. In 2017 the MUA had about 16,000 members. It was affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Australian Labor Party and the International Transport Workers Federation. From 2000 until its merger in 2018, Paddy Crumlin was National Secretary of the MUA and since 2010 he has been President of the ITF. He also holds the position of chair of the Dockers Section. In late 2015, the MUA and the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) commenced merger talks. On 29 February 2016, at the MUA national conference, delegates voted unanimously in favour of the merger. The Fair Work Commission approved the merger in March 2018. The merged union was named the Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union. HistoryWaterside Workers' Federation= An early banner of the Sydney Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation. The Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia traces its roots to the formation on the Australian waterfront in September 1872 of two unions in Sydney, the Labouring Men's Union of Circular Quay and the West Sydney Labouring Men's Association, which merged ten years later to form the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union. In 1884 the Melbourne Wharf Labourers' Union was formed with the support of Melbourne Trades Hall representatives, after shipowners refused to allow waterfront workers to attend Eight-hour Day celebrations. With Federation in 1901 and the impending introduction of an arbitration system, the national Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia was formed in 1902 under the leadership of Billy Hughes. The Communist Party of Australia was formed in October 1920, and achieved some influence in the trade union movement, especially in New South Wales. Though its influence had dwindled to an insignificant sect by the mid-1920s, it kept positions in particular trade unions, including the Waterside Workers' Federation. The union was regarded as militant and disruptive to the economy, and has suffered numerous attempts to suppress its activities. In 1928, the Nationalist government of Stanley Bruce enacted the Transport Workers Act 1928 requiring workers to have a license, known as the \\"dog collar\\", to work on the wharves. Employment of non-union labour and members of the Permanent & Casual Wharf Labourers Union almost killed off the Waterside Workers' Federation. In 1950 the WWF absorbed its industrial opposition the Permanent & Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia and in 1991 it amalgamated with the Australian Foremen Stevedore Association but retained the name Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia. =Seamen's Union= The Federated Seamens Union of Australasia (SUA) was formed in 1876 by the amalgamation of the Sydney Seamen's Union and the Melbourne Seamen's Union, adopting the name Seamen's Union of Australia in 1906. From December 1935 to February 1936 there was a long strike against an unsatisfactory award and poor working conditions. The strike failed, and the union was left divided and crippled.  Major Modern Day Disputes 1998 Waterfront Dispute= In 1998 the Maritime Union of Australia was involved in a waterfront dispute when Patrick Corporation attempted to sack 1400 waterfront workers across Australia and introduce non-union contract labour.  2015 Hutchison Ports Dispute  On 6 August 2015, just before midnight, Hutchison Ports, located in Sydney and Brisbane, sacked 97 workers by text message and email ‚Äì 57 in Sydney and 40 in Brisbane. This led to one of the longest running community assemblies in modern times.  Politics Influence with the Rudd Government= In 2009 the union ran a campaign entitled Time for a Sea Change in Australian Shipping calling on the government to revitalize Australian shipping by giving tax incentives for the industry to invest in new ships, providing training for new seafarers, and introducing pro-union laws. According to Glenn Milne, a Union Strategy document which was leaked in March 2008 reveals the union also wants a return to pattern bargaining. At the same time, in April 2008 the union began pushing for access to Howard Government strategy documents, which it believes will show ministers conspired with Patrick Corporation to smash the union. The timing of this move was potentially damaging for the union as Julia Gillard was in the process of talking to employers, in an attempt to rewrite the Howard Government's workplace relations system. One editorial in the Australian Financial Review said that Paddy Crumlin had done the workplace relations debate a \\"big favour\\" by trying to \\"revive the ghosts of the [1998 waterfront dispute]\\" because the union's power could show Labor that industries such as cafes, restaurants and accommodation needed flexibility but were being \\"shut out of consideration because their lobbies are less powerful\\". Merger 2015/16 with CFMEU Since late 2015, the MUA and CFMEU have been in merger talks to create \\"Australia's most powerful union\\". On 29 February 2016, at the MUA national conference, delegates voted unanimously in favour of a merger with the CFMEU. The Fair Work Commission approved the merger in March 2018.

Biography Vadian was born in St. Gallen into a family of wealthy and influential linen merchants. After having gone to school in St. Gallen, he moved to Vienna at the end of 1501, where he took up studies at faculty of arts the university, in particular under Conrad Celtis and Matthias Qualle. In Vienna, he changed his name to \\"Joachimus Vadianus\\"; like so many other humanists, he preferred a Latin name to express his admiration for the classic masters. He evaded the outbreak of the bubonic plague of 1506/07 by moving to Villach where he worked as a teacher and studied music. A study trip through northern Italy brought him to Trent, Venice, and Padua, where he met the Irish scholar Mauritius Hibernicus. In 1509 completed his studies with the degree of Master of Arts and returned for a short while to St. Gallen, where he studied the scriptures in the library of the abbey of St. Gall. He returned to Vienna, where he had some success as a writer. From 1512 on, he held the chair of poetry at the university of Vienna--he had gained some reputation as the author of Latin poems. In 1513, he visited Buda, and the following year, he was named poeta laureatus by emperor Maximilian I. In 1516, he was even named a Dean of the University of Vienna. In the following years, Vadian studied medicine and sciences, in particular geography and history under Georg Tannstetter, called Collimitius. In 1517, he was graduated as a doctor of medicine, and subsequently moved back to his hometown, St. Gallen. On that voyage, he visited many of his humanist acquaintances in Leipzig, Breslau, and Krak√≥w. In 1518, he climbed the Pilatus mountain near Lucerne, the first documented ascent to its top. In St. Gall, he was appointed city physician and on August 18, 1519, he married Martha Grebel, the sister of Conrad Grebel who would later become a leading figure of the Anabaptist movement. In 1521, he succeeded his father Leonhard, who had died on 20th December 1520, as a member of the city council. The beginning of the Reformation in Switzerland (he was a friend of Huldrych Zwingli) made him, who had never had a theological schooling, study ecclesiastic texts. From 1522 on, he sided with the new, reformed interpretation and henceforth was its most important proponent in St. Gallen. When he was elected mayor of the city in 1526, he led the conversion of St. Gallen to Protestantism, and managed to maintain that new state even after the victory of the Catholic cantons in the Second war of Kappel. Vadian wrote several theological texts after 1522, helping disseminate the reformatory views. He died in St. Gallen. In his testament, he donated his large private library to the city. His collection became the nucleus of the cantonal library of St. Gallen, which is named \\"Vadiana\\". Selected works *Vadian: De poetica et carminis ratione liber, Vienna 1518.

In several Asian cultures, including that of Tibet, the bead is considered to provide positive spiritual benefit. These beads are generally prized as protective amulets and are sometimes ground into a powder to be used in traditional Tibetan medicine. Beads subject to this process have small \\"dig marks\\" where a portion of the bead has been scraped or ground away to be included in the medicine. Some dzi exhibit grinding and polishing of one or both ends, again the result of reduction for use in traditional Tibetan medicine or, in some cases, due to the bead's use as a burnishing tool in the application of gold leaf to thanka paintings or gilt bronze statuary. The most highly prized dzi beads are those of ancient age, made of natural agate. The original source of these beads is a mystery. While the traditional, ancient- style beads are greatly preferred, new modern-made dzi are gaining popularity among Tibetans. In recent years, the anointing of the dzi bead with a herbal connection oil, along with wearing with correlating gemstones as a necklace was introduced in \\"The Complete Book of Dzi Beads\\", by author Tilii Bolin. Names The meaning of the Tibetan word \\"dzi\\" [‡ΩÇ‡Ωü‡Ω≤‡ºç] translates to \\"shine, brightness, clearness, splendor.\\" In Mandarin Chinese, dzi are called \\"heaven's bead\\" or \\"heaven's pearl\\" (Â§©Áè†; tiƒÅn zh≈´). Design Italian mountaineer Reinhold Messner wearing a Dzi amulet Dzi beads are made from agate, and may have decorative symbols composed of circles, ovals, squares, waves or zig zags, stripes, lines, diamonds, dots, and various other archetypal and symbolic patterns. Colors mainly range from brown to black, with the pattern usually in ivory white. Dzi beads can appear in different colours, shapes, and sizes; the surface is usually smooth and waxy, presumably resulting from wear over a long period of time. Sometimes the natural patterns (usually \\"layered\\" swirls) of the agate can be seen underneath or behind the decorative symbols and designs, and sometimes not. Cinnabar dots as seen on an ancient dzi.Some dzi beads exhibit what are referred to as \\"blood spots,\\" which are tiny red dots in the white areas, indicative of iron content. This is a highly desirable characteristic among collectors, but relatively rare. Another desirable effect is \\"NƒÅga skin,\\" in which the surface of the bead exhibits tiny circular weathering marks that resemble scales. Some dzi beads are simply polished agate, with no other decoration than the natural banding of the stone. The number of \\"eyes,\\" circular designs on the stone, is considered significant. The symbolic meaning of these beads is based on the number and arrangement of the dots. Origin Dzi stones made their first appearance between 2000 and 1000 BC, in ancient India: a few hundred thousand were supposedly brought back by Tibetan soldiers from Persia during a raid. The malicious effect of the ‚Äúevil eye‚Äù was taken very seriously by these people. Dzi were considered to counteract the evil eye. The artisans who made the dzi created amulets with ‚Äúeyes‚Äù on them as a ‚Äúfight fire with fire‚Äù form of protection. Artisans used agate as the base stone, and then embellished the beads lines and shapes using ancient methods that remain mysterious. Treatments may have included darkening with plant sugars and heat, bleaching and white line etching with natron, and protecting certain areas with grease, clay, wax or a similar substance. A hole was drilled before the bead was decorated as drilling caused most breakage during the production process, and holes were also useful for stringing and dipping numerous beads as a step in coloration. The earliest holes were conical and done with solid drill bits drilling from both ends and, hopefully, meeting near the center of the bead. Very small drill tips of chipped flint were used without abrasives and numerous other materials, regardless of hardness, when used with abrasives. Neolithic era beads were also drilled with hollow, tubular abrasion driven bits of reed and, later, during the Chalcolithic, copper. These drilled a hole with a core of agate inside the tubular drill. Tubular bit holes were parallel walled rather than conical, but also done from both ends. Both methods required arduous work done with a bow drill, with time and effort being determined by hardness of abrasive, from ground sand (quartz) to corundum. Although the geographic origin of dzi beads is uncertain, it is accepted that they are now called \\"Tibetan beads,\\" just like \\"Tibetan coral,\\" which also came to Tibet from elsewhere. Tibetans cherish these beads and consider them hereditary gems. In this way they have survived thousands of years, being worn by hundreds of individual people. Dzi are found primarily in Tibet, but also in neighbouring Bhutan, Nepal, Ladakh and Sikkim.Although Dzi type agate beads were made in the Indus Valley during the Harappan period and at various locations rich in agate deposits in India, such as in Khambhat, since their Neolithic periods, the earliest archaeologically controlled find of an agate bead with Dzi style decoration of straight and curved lines and circular eye found has been from a Saka culture excavation (Uigarak) in Kazakhstan, dated 7th - 5th C. BCE. These were said to be imports from India, reflecting long distance trade with the more nomadic Saka or Scythian tribes. Sometimes shepherds and farmers find dzi beads in the soil or in the grasslands. Because of this, some Tibetans traditionally believe or believed that dzi are naturally formed, not man-made Since knowledge of the bead is derived from several differing oral traditions, the beads have provoked controversy regarding their source, their method of manufacture and even their precise definition. In Tibetan culture these beads are believed to attract local protectors, dharmapalas or deities or maybe beneficial ghosts, ancestors or even bodhisattvas. Because of this, dzi beads are always treated with respect.Pattison, Eliot. [2004] (2004). Beautiful Ghost. St Martin Press. New dzi It has been reported that modern era dzi style beads were made in Idar Oberstein, Germany at least as early as the 19th C. The German agate- cutters at Idar-Oberstein plied their trade since the Roman Period. They brought the coloring of agates to a science and the cutting and drilling to the mechanical level of perfection for which Germans are known. Due to the questionable origin of most hand made dzi beads and the high demand for them, there has been relatively recent reproduction reported in Asia. The most convincing replica of ancient dzi beads came from Taiwan during the 1990s. China has also produced some good-quality dzi beads since about 2006. However, the number of modern dzi that would be accepted as beautiful by the Tibetan community is very small, making these beads highly desirable. From photos of contemporary Tibetans decked out in ceremonial garb, including numerous dzi beads, their taste and choice is more toward new, shiny and big than small and muted by the patination of age, and it is perhaps because of superficial and naive attraction to the unblemished, considered by many as \\"Pure\\" dzi, that they have allowed most of their truly ancient - vagaries and accidents of time, nature, and culture effected - heirlooms to be bought and/or exchanged for replicas. When one reads of the still current amuletic \\"charging\\" of newer dzi beads by Lamas to make them \\"pure\\" and give them supernatural power to replace that lost by taking small chips, \\"digs,\\" from a bead to be ingested as an ingredient in a curative potion, it is not difficult to understand how they fail to appreciate the \\"scarred\\" beauty of age and experience and even see it as a useful defacement, but a defacement nonetheless. Superstitious ritual and belief integral to creating these scars are, then, equally so in causing the loss in their desirability. This is distinctly similar to other tribal art wherein cultural belief and ritual are essential to empowering artistic creation. In the opinion of this writer, the \\"pure\\" dzi are the empty canvas, the marble block, and the markings of natural and cultural experience create the one of a kind masterpieces. This is a superficial view of a European on ancient culture. The older the bead, the more expensive it is. Therefore, they are presented by grandparents at the birth of grandchildren, providing them with a future. Buying new beads is a long-term investment. For 15 years, the cost of beads increases 4 times A nice dzi should be made of good quality agate with the cutting, drilling and decorating taking many days. Modern methods and technology such as lasers, modern sugars and chemicals, and vacuum chambers can produce very good results. beadbugle The waxy appearance is still desirable but is sometimes lacking. Some especially well-made new dzi are accepted by Tibetans because it is safe to wear them in public since they look like ancient dzi. Some claim the new dzi function with the same efficacy as the old ones; others believe the protective energies of ancient dzi can move into a new dzi, if the stone is of the same quality or better and the two beads are kept together or when binding rituals are performed. Dzi are also popular in China, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore. Genuine ancient dzi are too expensive for most Tibetans; those who have not owned dzi for generations can no longer afford to buy them. Some of the new dzi have become highly collectible resulting in much higher prices. As was true in ancient days, only a handful of artisans know how to make superior beads today. Less than a dozen people are manufacturing truly high-quality and beautiful beads; not much is known about who they are or where their workshops are. With a few exceptions, new beads are not considered to have the mystic associations of the ancient beads, but it is considered possible to give new dzi similar powers with some time and effort: 1) by taking them to be blessed by a lama or guru; 2) taking them on pilgrimages to holy places such as stupas and shrines; and 3) reciting mantras, as well as taking religious vows with them. An advantage of new dzi beads is that they do not carry any of the bad karma of previous owners. It is considered possible to rid a stone of bad energy by submerging it in saltwater for several hours, and then fanning incense over it. The dzi should be treated with respect from that time on. Sun basking and herbal smudging are also said to purify the beads. Spirit aroma offering and recitation of Cintamani dharani are considered helpful in charging the bead as well. Imitation dzi  Imitation dzi are created from materials other than agate or chalcedony. They can be made of glass, resin, lampwork, wood, bone, plastic, metal, or non- traditional etched stones. Imitation dzi have a long history, some dating back a couple of hundred years. The older mock dzi have some collectible value. Some of the resin mock dzi have a filling of lead to add weight. Some people would also call the modern machine-carved and machine-drilled, highly polished new dzi \\"mock dzi.\\" Almost invariably mass-produced, these are available for less than two dollars, and are often sold by the strand. The etching on these cheap beads has been done very quickly, and the decorations do not penetrate into the inner core of the bead. These are usually targeted for sale to mainland Chinese customers as lucky feng shui charms. Value Market value for ancient beads can easily reach into hundreds of thousands of US dollars - especially for beads with more \\"eyes.\\" Tiny red spots caused by iron inclusion in the agate also increase the value. New dzi prices range from about ten to two thousand US Dollars, depending on quality and luster. Similar beads Similar to dzi beads are the so-called chung dzi, which have been imported to Tibet since ancient times. These can be plain, naturally banded agate beads, or etched beads (often with black and white striped patterns). Some are carnelians or black agate with thin white etching patterns resembling the back of a turtle, which is an ancient pattern that dates back to the era of the Harappan Indus culture. Ancient Roman agate beads as well as etched Bactrian, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Afghan, Yemeni, and Indian agate and carnelian beads made their way into Tibet. All these are considered chung dzi (in Tibetan, \\"chung\\" means ordinary or common). Chung dzi are believed to have similar properties to real \\"eyed\\" dzi; they are less valuable, but they are highly prized by Tibetans and also considered a variety of dzi. Another similar type of bead is called Luk Mik (\\"goat‚Äôs eye\\") - it is a naturally formed \\"one-eyed\\" coin-shaped agate (pictured). Luk Mik are the preferred dzi for travelling in Tibet. The antique Pyu and Phumtek beads of Burma are also similar in some ways to dzi: they share some of the dzi bead patterns, but instead of agate, the Phumtek are generally made from petrified opalized palm wood, while Pyu beads are often made of red or orange carnelian with some thin white alkali- etched lines.

The cast also features Helen Hunt, Dan Aykroyd, Elizabeth Berkley, John Schuck, Wallace Shawn, David Ogden Stiers and Charlize Theron. The plot concerns an insurance investigator and an efficiency expert who are both hypnotized by a crooked hypnotist into stealing jewels. The Curse of the Jade Scorpion received mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  In 1940, C.W. Briggs (Woody Allen) is an insurance investigator in New York City who is highly successful, owing to his many connections and ability to think like a criminal. His work does not impress Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), an efficiency expert who butts heads with C.W. over his old-fashioned views. Her advice is usually followed, however, because she secretly is in a relationship with her boss, Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd), who constantly reassures her that they will be free to pursue their relationship in public once he finalizes his divorce with his wife. While attending a dinner with some employees, Voltan (David Ogden Stiers), a stage magician calls on Betty Ann and C.W. to be in his hypnotism act. Using the words \\"Madagascar\\" and \\"Constantinople\\" on them, respectively, as trigger words to put them in a trance, the two are given the suggestion that they are newlyweds who are madly in love before being reawakened. When C.W. returns home for the evening, he receives a call from Voltan, who uses C.W.'s trigger word to put him back in a trance and orders him to steal jewels for him. C.W. has no recollections of these crimes after he is woken up and is determined to prove himself by solving the crimes. He starts investigating Betty Ann on the grounds of her suspicious behavior (actually related to her affair with Chris) and sneaks into her house one evening. There, he witnesses Chris telling her that he has reconciled with his wife and will not have a divorce. When Magruder leaves, Betty Ann becomes drunk in a fit of depression and tries to jump out of a window. C.W. stops her and spends the night keeping her from other self- destructive activities. Eventually, investigations start picking up evidence pointing to C.W., leading to his arrest. He manages to escape to Betty Ann's place, where she grudgingly hides him. Thinking that C.W. is no longer available, Voltan calls Betty Ann, using her trigger word of \\"Madagascar\\" to put her in a hypnotic state and steal for him. On her return, still in a trance, the subliminal suggestion of being in love leads her to seduce C.W. Eventually his co-workers and friends George Bond (Wallace Shawn) and Alvin \\"Al\\" (Brian Markinson) recall the initial hypnotism and realize that it is the cause of the robberies. George, an amateur magician, frees C.W. of the trigger word and restores his memories. C.W. realizes what has happened and goes back to Betty Ann's apartment to find her missing. He then realizes that she must have been hypnotized again and manages to locate the site where the still- hypnotized Betty Ann is delivering the jewels to Voltan. Voltan discovers C.W. and holds him at gunpoint. However, C.W. deduces that a small-time criminal like Voltan would not have the nerve to do something as drastic as murder. Voltan tries escaping, but the police catch him shortly after. The still- hypnotized Betty Ann expresses her love for C.W. who takes advantage of her state to passionately kiss her before erasing her memories of the event. Back at work, the employees talk about Betty Ann and Chris going on a romantic getaway. C.W. goes to Chris to inform him of his resignation. An apologetic Chris understands and lets him know that if C.W. leaves, the company will give him his blessing and if he stays, Chris will give him a raise. He also promises C.W. that if he stays, he will make sure that Betty Ann will no longer interfere with his work, letting him know that he intends on forcing her to retire after they get married, as he does not want his wife to be working with him. This visibly disturbs C.W., who then heads to Betty Ann's office to let her know of his resignation and say goodbye. The two have a parting drink during which Betty Ann playfully insults C.W. a few more times and he expresses his amazement that an intelligent woman like Betty Ann would be with Chris, stating that she refuses to be vulnerable even at the price of finding true love and happiness. Outside, Al says that he will quit if C.W. does, and the rest of the staff hail him as a hero. C.W. dismisses his success as luck. When Al notes that hypnotism can make people do things that they do not want to do, George reveals that a hypnotized would not do anything that they would not when in a normal state, leading everyone to realize that both C.W. and Betty Ann have secret criminal instincts. Al then privately gets C.W. to admit that he loves Betty Ann. At Al's urging, C.W. decides to go after Betty Ann, who is about to leave for Paris with Chris. C.W. proceeds to propose to Betty Ann, confess his love for her, and convince her that she loves him, too. She repeatedly rejects and insults C.W. while Chris tries to get C.W. to leave. As Betty Ann and Chris are about to leave, a desperate C.W. uses her trigger word to hypnotize Betty Ann. Betty Ann, who is now in an amorous state, dreamily tells Chris that she is staying with C.W. and announces that the two are getting married, confessing to C.W. that she fell in love with him the moment that they met. A frantic Chris runs to stop his divorce while Al presents C.W. with the jade scorpion as a gift. C.W. and Betty Ann decide to go to her apartment to have sex. As they are leaving, Al notes that it was lucky that George forgot to deprogram Betty Ann, but George reveals that he had done that the night before. Meanwhile, Betty Ann continues to gush out her love for C.W., and C.W. promises her that he will be able to make her love him for real. Betty Ann notes that anything is possible, pointing out that she was able to make C.W. fall in love with her without using his trigger word. At that moment, he realizes that Betty Ann is no longer hypnotized and finds her grinning knowingly. Understanding that she is going with him willingly, the two head off with Betty Ann putting her arm around him. CastCritical reception The film received mixed reviews from critics. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 45%, based on 122 reviews, with the site's critical consensus rating, \\"The writing for Scorpion is not as sharp as Woody Allen's previous movies as most of the jokes fall flat.\\" Metacritic gives the film an average score of 52 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Allen himself seems to be in relative agreement with some critics, remarking that it is perhaps his worst movie. Allen has said he felt he let down the rest of the cast by casting himself as the lead. He explained that part of the problem was the period setting and the set building expense which made it too expensive to go back and re-shoot anything. Allen re-shot the entirety of his 1987 drama September after he felt he got the casting wrong.Lax, Eric. Conversations with Woody Allen: His Films, the Movies, and Movie Making. New York: Knopf, 2007. Allen remarked he offered the role of C.W. Briggs to both Jack Nicholson and Tom Hanks, but had to take it when both refused. With its production budget of $33 million, it is Allen's most expensive film. In relation to most of his most successful productions, the film fared poorly in American theaters with ticket sales of over seven million dollars. Its worldwide gross was $18.9 million. However, in the ten years since its release, it is beginning to enjoy a new generation of cult status comedic recognition. Roger Ebert wrote, \\"There are pleasures in the film that have little to do with the story. Its look and feel is uncanny; it's a tribute to a black-and-white era, filmed in color, and yet the colors seem burnished and aged. No noir films were shot in color in the 1940s, but if one had been, it would have looked like this. And great attention is given to the women played by Hunt, Berkley and Theron; they look not so much like the women in classic film noir as like the women on film noir posters‚Äîtheir costumes and styles elevate them into archetypes. Hunt in particular has fun with a wisecracking dame role that owes something, perhaps, to Rosalind Russell in His Girl Friday.\\" Tribute French singer-songwriter Dimie Cat pays a tribute to the film in the song \\"Woody Woody\\", from her album ZigZag.

The opera was intended by Martin≈Ø, who was then living in Paris, for performance at the Paris World Exhibition of 1937. However, various delays (including the intervening World War II) prevented its performance during the composer's lifetime. The opera's first performance was given at the Opera House, Mannheim, on 18 February 1964, when it was conducted by Georg Calder. Shortly afterwards it was given its first performance in Martin≈Ø's native Czechoslovakia by the Brno Jan√°ƒçek Opera. The opera is subtitled 'The Tragedy of a Man who Had His Beard Cut', and the surrealist libretto is set in Paris about 1900. Although Martin≈Ø had asked Wurmser for a libretto including a singing cat, he compromised on Wurmser's suggestion of a singing portrait, which acts as narrator to a tale of bourgeois infidelity. Roles * Armanda, soprano * Alexandre, baritone * Oskar, tenor * Philom√®ne, mezzo-soprano * Portrait, bass Synopsis The opera takes place in a bourgeois salon in Paris around 1900. The maid Philom√®ne is cleaning and complaining about her life. The husband Alexandre, bearded, asks Philom√®ne to bring in a suitcase and secretly leaves, allegedly for the station, crossing his cousin of the same name from America. Alexander's portrait on the wall is outraged by the game of betrayal. Oscar, a man Armande had met on holiday, comes to visit her. He is dressed in sportswear and offers her a lesson in cycling. Armanda rejects his courtship, pointing out that she is polite and respectable. Oscar leaves. The beardless Alexander-cousin arrives and explains that Alexander- husband has gone away. Armande falls in love with him at first sight and submits to him, which displeases the painting of Alexander and the maid Philom√®ne. Armande then has dreams full of remorse. In the first dream, both Alexanders kill each other. In the second, the goddess of marriage, played by Philom√®ne, condemns Armande and she is abducted by demons - bearded dancers. In the third, the suitor Oscar appears and dances with Armande on roller skates. In the morning the maid Philomena cleans up in the salon and complains about her life. Alexandre-husband enters, without his beard, and says goodbye to Armande before leaving for the office. During the farewell, he discovers that his wife has also changed. After his departure Oscar enters. To his surprise, this time Armanda accepts his invitation for a cycling lesson. The portrait of the husband is left alone and expresses the 'moral' - that it is best if a husband does not tempt his wife.

It also provided some liberation for men and women marginalized by Greek society, among which are slaves, outlaws, and non-citizens. In their final phase the Mysteries shifted their emphasis from a chthonic, underworld orientation to a transcendental, mystical one, with Dionysus changing his nature accordingly. By its nature as a mystery religion reserved for the initiated, many aspects of the Dionysian cult remain unknown and were lost with the decline of Greco-Roman polytheism; modern knowledge is derived from descriptions, imagery and cross-cultural studies. Origins The Derveni krater, height : 90.5 cm (35 ¬Ω in.), 4th century BC The Dionysian Mysteries of mainland Greece and the Roman Empire are thought to have evolved from a more primitive initiatory cult of unknown origin (perhaps Thracian or Phrygian) which had spread throughout the Mediterranean region by the start of the Classical Greek period. Its spread was associated with the dissemination of wine, a sacrament or entheogen with which it appears always to have been closely associated (though mead may have been the original sacrament). Beginning as a simple rite, it evolved quickly within Greek culture into a popular mystery religion, which absorbed a variety of similar cults (and their gods) in a typically Greek synthesis across its territories; one late form was the Orphic Mysteries. However, all stages of this developmental spectrum appear to have continued in parallel throughout the eastern Mediterranean until late in Greek history and forcible Christianization. Early Dionysus cult The ecstatic cult of Dionysus was originally thought to be a late arrival in Greece from Thrace or Asia Minor, due to its popularity in both locations and Dionysus' non-integration into the Olympian Pantheon. After the deity's name was discovered on Mycenean Linear B tablets, however, this theory was abandoned and the cult is considered indigenous, predating Greek civilization. The absence of an early Olympian Dionysus is today explained by patterns of social exclusion and the cult's marginality, rather than chronology. Whether the cult originated on Minoan Crete (as an aspect of an ancient Zagreus) or Africa ‚Äì or in Thrace or Asia, as a proto-Sabazius ‚Äì is unanswerable, due to lack of evidence. Some scholars believe it was an adopted cult not native to any of these places and may have been an eclectic cult in its earliest history, although it almost certainly obtained many familiar features from Minoan culture.Rostovtzeff, M. Rome (translated from the Russian by J. D. Duff). London: Oxford University Press (1960), pp. 93‚Äì94. =Role of wine= Pan and a Satyr; Dionysus holds a rhyton (drinking vessel) in the shape of a panther; traces of red and yellow colour are preserved on the hair of the figures and the branches; from an Asia Minor workshop, 170-180 AD, National Archaeological Musea, Athens, Greece The original rite of Dionysus (as introduced into Greece) is associated with a wine cult (not unlike the entheogenic cults of ancient Central America), concerned with the grapevine's cultivation and an understanding of its life cycle (believed to have embodied the living god) and the fermentation of wine from its dismembered body (associated with the god's essence in the underworld). Most importantly, however, the intoxicating and disinhibiting effects of wine were regarded as due to possession by the god's spirit (and, later, as causing this possession). Wine was also poured on the earth and its growing vine, completing the cycle. The cult was not solely concerned with the vine itself, but also with the other components of wine. Wine includes other ingredients (herbal, floral and resinous) adding to its quality, flavour and medicinal properties. Scholars have suggested that, given the low alcoholic content of early wine, its effects may have been due to an additional entheogenic ingredient in its sacramental form. Honey and beeswax were often added to wine, introducing an even older drink (mead). K√°roly Ker√©nyi postulated that this wine lore superseded (and partly absorbed) earlier Neolithic mead lore involving bee swarms associated by the Greeks with Dionysus.Die Religion der Griechen und R√∂mer (The Religion of the Greeks and Romans), (1963). Mead and beer (with its cereal base) were incorporated into the domain of Dionysus, perhaps through his identification with the Thracian corn deity Sabazius. Other plants believed to be viniculturally significant were also included in wine lore such as ivy (thought to counteract drunkenness‚Äîthus the opposite of the grapevine‚Äîand seen as blooming in winter instead of summer); the fig (a purgative of toxins) and the pine (a wine preservative). The bull (from whose horn wine was drunk) and goat (whose flesh provided wineskins, and whose browsing pruned the vines) were also part of the cult, eventually seen as manifestations of Dionysus. Some of these associations had been linked with fertility deities (like Dionysus) and became part of his new role. An understanding of vinicultural lore and its symbolism is key to understanding the cult which emerged from it, assuming a significance other than winemaking that would encompass life, death and rebirth and providing insight into human psychology. Assuming the Dionysus cult arrived in Greece with the importation of wine, it probably first emerged about 6000 BC in one of two places‚Äîthe Zagros Mountains and borderlands of Mesopotamia and Persia (with a rich wine culture via Asia Minor), or from wild vines on the mountain slopes of Libya and other regions in North Africa. The latter provided wine to ancient Egypt wine from about 2500 BC, and was home to ecstatic rites involving animal possession‚Äînotably the goat and panther men of the Aissaoua Sufi cult of Morocco (although this cult may have been influenced by the Dionysian one). In any case Minoan Crete was the next link in the chain, importing wine from the Egyptians, Thracians and Phoenicians and exporting it to its colonies (such as Greece). The Mysteries probably took shape in Minoan Crete from about 3000 to 1000 BC, since the name \\"Dionysus\\" exists nowhere other than Crete and Greece. =Rites= Hellenistic Greek mosaic depicting the god Dionysos as a winged daimon riding on a tiger, from the House of Dionysos at Delos (which was once controlled by Athens) in the South Aegean region of Greece, late 2nd century BC, Archaeological Museum of Delos The rites were based on a seasonal death- rebirth theme, common among agricultural cults such as the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Osirian Mysteries paralleled the Dionysian, according to contemporary Greek and Egyptian observers. Spirit possession involved liberation from civilization's rules and constraints. It celebrated that which was outside civilized society and a return to primordial nature‚Äîwhich would later assume mystical overtones. It also involved escape from the socialized personality and ego into an ecstatic, deified state or the primal herd (sometimes both). In this sense Dionysus was the beast-god within, or the unconscious mind of modern psychology.Aziz, Robert (1990). C.G. Jung's Psychology of Religion and Synchronicity (10 ed.). The State University of New York Press. . Such activity has been interpreted as fertilizing, invigorating, cathartic, liberating and transformative, and so appealed to those on the margins of society: women, slaves, outlaws and \\"foreigners\\" (non-citizens, in Greek democracy). All were equal in a cult that inverted their roles, similar to the Roman Saturnalia. Although the Greek Dionysian rites were associated with women, the cult officers' titles were of both genders‚Äîbelying the claim that the cult was solely for women. The trance induction central to the cult involved not only chemognosis,An altered state caused by drug use. but an \\"invocation of spirit\\" with the bullroarer and communal dancing to drum and pipe. The trances are described in familiar anthropological terms, with characteristic movements (such as the backward head flick found in all trance- inducing cults) found today in Afro-American Vodou and its counterparts. As in Vodou rites, certain rhythms were associated with the trance. Rhythms are also found preserved in Greek prose referring to the Dionysian rites (such as Euripides' The Bacchae). This collection of classical quotes describes rites in the Greek countryside in the mountains, to which processions were made on feast days: :Following the torches as they dipped and swayed in the darkness, they climbed mountain paths with head thrown back and eyes glazed, dancing to the beat of the drum which stirred their blood' [or 'staggered drunkenly with what was known as the Dionysus gait']. 'In this state of ekstasis or enthusiasmos, they abandoned themselves, dancing wildly and shouting 'Euoi!' [the god's name] and at that moment of intense rapture became identified with the god himself. They became filled with his spirit and acquired divine powers. Hoyle, Peter, Delphi, London : Cassell, 1967. Cf. p. 76. This practice is demonstrated in Greek culture by the Bacchanals of the Maenads, Thyiades and Bacchoi; many Greek rulers considered the cult a threat to civilized society and wished to control it (if not suppress it altogether). The latter failed; the former would succeed in the foundation of a domesticated Dionysianism as a state religion in Athens. This was but one form of Dionysianism‚Äîa cult which assumed different forms in different localities (often absorbing indigenous divinities and their rites, as did Dionysus himself). The Greek Bacchoi claimed that, like wine, Dionysus had a different flavour in different regions; reflecting their mythical and cultural soil, he appeared under different names and appearances in different regions. =Dionysian paraphernalia= * Kantharos, drinking cup with large handles, originally the rhyton (drinking horn from a bull), later a kylix, or wine goblet * Thyrsos, long wand with pine cone on top, carried by initiates and those possessed by the god * Stave, once cast into ground to mark ritual space * Krater, mixing bowl * Flagellum, a scourge * Minoan double axe, once used for sacrificial rites, later replaced by the Greek kopis (curved dagger) * Retis, hunter's net * Laurel crown and cloak, purple robe, or leopard or fawnskin nebix * Hunting boots * Persona masks * Bullroarer * Salpinx, long, straight trumpet * Pan flute * Tympanon, a frame drum * Liknon, sacred basket with fig =Traditional offerings to Dionysus= Musk, civet, frankincense, storax, ivy, grapes, pine, fig, wine, honey, apples, Indian hemp, orchis root, thistle, all wild and domestic trees. =Animals sacred to Dionysus= Dionysus has numerous sacred animals, such as the leopard or bull. Other sacred animals include: Lions and other big cats, goats, donkies, and serpents. The bull and goat and their \\"enemies\\", the panther (or any big cat ‚Äì after the Greeks colonized part of India, Shiva's tiger sometimes replaced the traditional panther or leopard) and the serpent (probably derived from Sabazius, but also found in North African cults); in addition, the dolphin, the lion, and the bee. Bulls Dionysus‚Äôs association with bulls is found in multiple epithets. In The Bacchae, Penthus, who opposed his worship in the god‚Äôs origin city of Thebes, saw horns upon Dionysus‚Äôs head as he started to go mad. Dionysus‚Äôs epithets connected to bulls are as follows: Taurokephalos/Taurokranos/Tauromet√¥pos Greek: Œ§Œ±œÖœÅŒøœÜŒ±Œ≥ŒøœÇ; a surname of Dionysus in the Orphic mysteries. (Orph. Hymn. 51. 2.) It also occurs as a surname of rivers and the ocean, who were symbolically represented as bulls, to indicate their fertilising effect upon countries. (Eurip. Iphig. Aul. 275, Orest. 1378 ; Aelian, V. H. ii. 33; Horat. Carm. iv. 14, 25.) Tauros; a bull, occurs as a surname of Dionysus. (Eurip. Bacch. 918 ; Athen. xi. p. 476; Plut. Quaest. Graec. 36 ; Lycoph. Cass. 209.) Invocations of Dionysus (from the Orphic hymns) :\\"I call upon loud-roaring and revelling Dionysus, :primeval, double-natured, thrice-born, Bacchic lord, :wild, ineffable, secretive, two- horned and two-shaped. :Ivy-covered, bull-faced, warlike, howling, pure, :You take raw flesh, you have feasts, wrapt in foliage, decked with grape clusters. :Resourceful Eubouleus, immortal god sired by Zeus :When he mated with Persephone in unspeakable union. :Hearken to my voice, O blessed one, :and with your fair-girdled nymphs breathe on me in a spirit of perfect agape\\". :\\"In intoxication, physical or spiritual, the initiate recovers an intensity of feeling which prudence had destroyed; he finds the world full of delight and beauty, and his imagination is suddenly :liberated from the prison of everyday preoccupations. The Bacchic ritual produced what was called 'enthusiasm', which means etymologically having the god enter the worshipper, who believed :that he became one with the god\\".Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy. : :Orphic Hymn XLIV. To Dionysus Bassareus :A Hymn :Come, blessed Dionysius [Dionysos], various nam'd, bull-fac'd, begot from Thunder, Bacchus [Bakkhos] fam'd. Bassarian God, of universal might, whom swords, and blood, and sacred rage delight: In heav'n rejoicing, mad, loud-sounding God, furious inspirer, bearer of the rod: By Gods rever'd, who dwell'st with human kind, propitious come, with much-rejoicing mind. : :Orphic Hymn XLV. To Liknitus Bacchus [Liknitos Dionysus] :The Fumigation from Manna. :Liknitan Bacchus [Liknitos Dionysos], bearer of the vine, thee I invoke to bless these rites divine: Florid and gay, of nymphs the blossom bright, and of fair Venus [Aphrodite], Goddess of delight, 'Tis thine mad footsteps with mad nymphs to beat, dancing thro' groves with lightly leaping feet: From Jove's [Zeus'] high counsels nurst by Proserpine [Persephoneia], and born the dread of all the pow'rs divine: Come, blessed pow'r, regard thy suppliant's voice, propitious come, and in these rites rejoice. : :Orphic Hymn XLVI. To Bacchus Pericionius [Dionysus Perikionios] :The Fumigation from Aromatics. :Bacchus Pericionius [Dionysos Perikionios], hear my pray'r, who mad'st the house of Cadmus once thy care, With matchless force, his pillars twining round, (when burning thunders shook the solid ground, In flaming, founding torrents borne along), propt by thy grasp indissolubly strong. Come mighty Bacchus to these rites inclin'd, and bless thy suppliants with rejoicing mind. : Inscription about the mysteries in Plovdiv An ancient Roman inscription written in Ancient Greek dated to 253 ‚Äì 255 AD were discovered in the Great Basilica at the Plovdiv (ancient Philippopolis).

It stars Matthew Modine, Catherine Keener, and Maxwell Caulfield. The film is a satire on New York's fashion and entertainment industries. Plot Joe is an aspiring actor working as a bus boy in a high-class restaurant. His longtime girlfriend Mary works as a cosmetician for the fashion industry and largely supports him with her steady income. Joe is more concerned with expressing himself than getting a paying job, and has been unwilling to accept roles that do not live up to his artistic standard. Mary supports Joe, but urges him to accept any role to get his foot in the door. Meanwhile, his co-worker Bob lands a lucrative role on a soap opera. Bob is a classically trained actor, but is willing to overlook the quality of the material for the money. He also has a fetish for natural blonde women, leading him to date Sahara, a naive model, and then dump her after discovering that her hair is dyed. Joe swallows his artistic pride and meets with an agent, Dee Dee Taylor, who arranges for him to be an extra in a Madonna video. Mary is harassed as she walks to work each day and begins taking a self-defense and anger management class on the advice of her therapist. The instructor encourages her to express her anger, and she finds the class extremely empowering. Bob is successful in his soap opera role and begins a relationship with his costar Kelly, a \\"real blonde\\". At the Madonna video, the director treats Joe and the other extras like cattle. Joe meets Madonna's body double, Tina, a friendly aspiring actress, and gets himself fired for protesting an anti-Semitic statement made by the assistant director. Joe's firing sparks an argument between Joe and Mary. The pressure of Joe's career is straining their relationship, and they have not had sex in a long time. Mary's instructor, Doug, gives her a ride home from her class and makes a pass at her. She rebuffs him, but lies to cover up the incident to Joe. Meanwhile, Bob suffers from erectile dysfunction and is unable to have sex with Kelly. She mocks his inadequacy and leaves him. Dee Dee takes pity on Joe and allows him to audition for the role of a \\"sexy serial killer\\". He reads his lines with Tina and begins to improvise his dialogue. He impresses the producers and lands the role. Tina invites him out for a drink and he resists her advances with some difficulty. Mary meets with her therapist and tells him about her experience with her self-defense instructor. He tells her that she must become comfortable with men showing their attraction to her and begins sharing his own sexual fantasies about her. She storms out of the session. Meanwhile, Bob is negotiating a longtime contract on the soap opera, but Kelly continues to taunt him on set. Bob threatens to quit the show and then forces the producer to kill off Kelly's character. Bob goes back to dating Sahara, with whom he is miserable. Joe breaks the big news about his role to Mary and they rejoice. Mary asks him if she is wrong for feeling angry when men hit on her. Joe supports her and threatens to beat up her therapist if he ever sees him again. They have sex for the first time in months and drift off to sleep, happy and satisfied. Mary wraps her hand around Joe's finger, revealing that his improvised monologue had been about his feelings for her.

It is 4,000 km long, making it the third longest highway in Brazil. It runs through the Amazon forest and the Brazilian states of Para√≠ba, Cear√°, Piaui, Maranh√£o, Tocantins, Par√° and Amazonas, from the proximities of Saboeiro up until the town of L√°brea. History An unpaved portion of the highway, taken between Rur√≥polis and Uruar√°. The highway was intended to integrate these regions with the rest of the country, and with Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. Another main goal of the project was to alleviate the effects of the drought affecting the Northeast region of the country by providing a route to largely empty land in the middle of the rainforest, which could be settled. It was originally planned to be a fully paved highway 5200 kilometers long. However, these plans were modified following its inauguration. In particular, because of high construction costs and Brazil financial crisis in the late 1970s, only a part of the highway was paved, from its beginning to 200 km ahead of Marab√°. The lack of a fully sealed road caused many problems. Travel on the non-paved stretches of the highway is extremely difficult during the region's rainy season between October and March. In the wet season cars often get stuck in the poorly constructed road and in the dry season there are often pot holes in the dry mud roads that damage vehicles. Construction of the highway was very challenging because of the remoteness of the site. Workers building the road were frequently isolated and without communication. Occasional visits to nearby cities provided the only outside contact. However, severe techniques and procedures that evolved during the construction of Bel√©m-Bras√≠lia Highway (BR-153) were then used. According to , roughly 800 km of the highway is due to be paved in the next 4 years, improving transport links in the central region of Par√° state. The Brazilian Government are now planning to pave with tarmac the whole highway. As of December 2009, paving was underway between the town of Ruropolis and Itaituba and north to Santar√©m. This will connect soy plantations with overland trucking routes to the south of Brazil. The road has been left untouched however at points further west of Itaituba, at times narrowing to roughly 2 meters wide. Access to the construction sites was mostly accomplished by small airplanes using temporary airstrips and boats. Today construction vehicles can be seen traversing the road east and west bringing dirt and gravel to prepare for paving operations. Deforestation and conservation Minist√©rio da Infraestrutura retoma obras de pavimenta√ß√£o na Transamaz√¥nica It has indirectly caused a great deal of deforestation in Brazil, as roads make it easier to transport timber. Satellite images demonstrate how roads increase deforestation. Access roads branch perpendicularly off BR-230 allowing deeper penetration into the surrounding jungle areas. Originally, the roads were to open up land for agriculture by settlers, the government motto \\"land without men for men without land\\" was coined to describe the development of the Amazon. However, loggers have used these roadways to further deforest the surrounding jungle. Various conservation units have been created along the route of the highway in an effort to halt deforestation or to manage forestry sustainably. In the western section from L√°brea to Humait√°, the fully protected Mapinguari National Park is south of the highway and the sustainable use Balata-Tufari National Forest is to the north. East of Humait√° the Humait√° National Forest lies to the south of the highway, then the Campos Amaz√¥nicos National Park and Juruena National Park.

Focusing on art and design from the present, it provides an active site for contemporary culture in Singapore. It comprises five galleries that span a total of 1,500 square metres, one of the largest spaces devoted to contemporary art in Singapore. It engages local and international audiences in critical viewing and discussion through a diverse programme of exhibitions, projects, publications and events. The ICA Singapore provides a cultural and educational tool for students and the wider public to advance their knowledge and appreciation of the contemporary local, regional and international arts. History The Dr Earl Lu Gallery was established by LASALLE College of the Arts in 1986, in recognition of a major contribution of artworks by philanthropist and artist Dr Earl Lu, it presented exhibitions of traditional and contemporary arts, often with a focus on practices from Asia. From 2001 to 2004, under the directorship of Binghui Huangfu, the gallery worked closely with LASALLE‚Äôs Contemporary Asian Art Centre, a research facility directed by T.K. Sabapathy that sought to advance knowledge and collaboration between artists across Asia through dialogue, research and publications. In 2004, Dr Earl Lu Gallery was renamed the Institute of Contemporary Arts Singapore and repositioned as a centre of Singapore and international contemporary art. In 2007, the institute moved along with LASALLE College of the Arts from the Goodman Road campus to a new campus on McNally Street, where it is based today. Since its establishment, the ICA Singapore has presented exhibitions of international contemporary art. These include solo exhibitions by Yeo Hwee Bin (2000), On Kawara (2004), Antony Gormley (2005), Lim Tzay Chuen (2005), Roberto Chabet (2011), Ian Woo (2011), Jeremy Sharma (2012) Milenko Prvacki (2012), Shubigi Rao (2013), Tang Da Wu (2013), Jack Tan (2015), Marco Fusinato (2015) and Ana Prvaƒçki (2015‚Äì16).

Past directors of the ICA Singapore include Binghui Huangfu (1996‚Äì2003), Eugene Tan (2003‚Äì08) and Charles Merewether (2010‚Äì13). The current director of ICA Singapore is Melbourne-born curator Bala Starr. Controversies In February 2016, two items that were part of the group show \\"Fault-lines: Disparate and desperate intimacies\\" were removed from artist Loo Zihan's installation \\"Queer objects: An archive for the future\\". This action was agreed after discussion between ICA Singapore staff, curator Wong Binghao, and Loo Zihan, and was due to the nature of the objects, which could potentially be considered offensive to some members of the public. The items were a penis sheath and a butt plug. The ICA Singapore, curator and artist emphasised that the decision was taken to make the exhibition accessible to all, including students of the LASALLE College of the Arts, half of whom are under 18 years old.

Set in New York, the plot involves the interaction between two women ‚Äì a bored housewife and a bohemian drifter ‚Äì linked by various messages in the personal column of a newspaper. The film was Madonna's first major screen role and also provided early parts for a number of other well-known performers, such as John Turturro, Laurie Metcalf, Aidan Quinn, and Steven Wright. The New York Times named it one of the ten best films of 1985.  Plot  Roberta, an unfulfilled housewife in Fort Lee, New Jersey, is fascinated by messages between lovers Susan and Jim in the personals section of a New York City tabloid, particularly an ad from Jim with the headline ‚ÄúDesperately Seeking Susan‚Äù, seeking a rendezvous in Battery Park. In an Atlantic City hotel, the itinerant Susan reads the ad after a tryst with mobster Meeker. She steals a pair of ornate Egyptian earrings from his coat before departing; the sinister Nolan notices Susan's embellished tuxedo jacket as she leaves. Arriving in New York City, Susan dons one of the earrings, stashing the other in her suitcase in a Port Authority locker. She asks to stay with her friend Crystal, a magician's assistant at the Magic Club, and learns Meeker was killed at the hotel. Hoping to spot the lovers, Roberta goes to Battery Park and sees Jim reunite with Susan before leaving with his band for Buffalo. Roberta follows Susan to a vintage store, watching her trade in her jacket before losing sight of her, and buys the jacket. Finding Susan's locker key, she posts another ‚ÄúDesperately Seeking Susan‚Äù ad to meet with her to return it. Concerned about the ad and Susan's connection to Meeker's death, Jim asks his friend Dez to check on her. Waiting for Susan at Battery Park and wearing her jacket, Roberta is accosted by Nolan, mistaking her for Susan. Susan spots Roberta, but is arrested for not paying her cab fare. Dez arrives and rescues Roberta, who hits her head and loses her memory. Also mistaking Roberta for Susan, Dez takes her to the Port Authority to collect Susan's suitcase, finding the other earring, and lets her stay at his apartment. Roberta, believing she must be Susan, retraces Susan's steps with Nolan in pursuit. She arrives at the Magic Club ‚Äì narrowly missing Susan, who has been released from jail and discovered her suitcase gone ‚Äì and is hired as Crystal's replacement. After Roberta's disastrous first performance, Nolan attacks her, demanding the earrings, but he escapes as the police arrive. Roberta hits her head again, regaining her memory, but is mistaken for a prostitute and arrested. Searching for Roberta, her husband Gary finds his way to the vintage store and is put in touch with Susan, who believes Roberta and Dez are connected to Meeker's death and want to frame her. Susan accompanies Gary home, where they get high. Roberta calls from jail, but hangs up when Susan and Gary answer. After calling Dez to bail her out, they find his apartment ransacked by Nolan, and sleep together. At Gary's house, Susan sees a TV report about Meeker and Nolan having stolen the earrings, once belonging to Nefertiti. She realizes the truth from Roberta's diary, and posts an ad to meet her at the Magic Club. Dez attacks an intruder in his apartment who turns out to be Jim, and confesses to his relationship with ‚ÄúSusan‚Äù as Roberta slips away. She reads the ad, as do Jim and Dez; they arrive at the Magic Club, along with Gary, his sister Leslie, and Nolan. During her act, Roberta recognizes Nolan, who flees backstage. Dez leaves as Roberta tries to explain the events of her disappearance to Gary, finally voicing her unhappiness and ending their marriage. Nolan threatens Susan at gunpoint, but is knocked out by Roberta. Later, Roberta finds Dez at work in a theater projection booth. She ‚Äúintroduces‚Äù herself and they kiss, as Jim and Susan reunite in the theater below. A final newspaper headline reveals that Roberta and Susan returned the earrings.  Cast  Production  The filmmakers initially wanted Diane Keaton and Goldie Hawn to play Roberta and Susan, but the director decided to cast newcomers Arquette and Madonna instead and the studio wanted the film to have younger actors in order to appeal to younger filmgoers. Bruce Willis was up for the role of Dez and Melanie Griffith was up for the part of Susan. Madonna barely obtained the role over Ellen Barkin and Jennifer Jason Leigh. Suzanne Vega also auditioned for the role. The Statue of Liberty can be seen in the film when it was still covered in scaffolding during its two-year renovation. Costume designer Santo Loquasto designed Susan's distinctive jacket (supposedly first worn by Jimi Hendrix), basis of the plot of mistaken identity. The film was inspired in part by the 1974 film C√©line et Julie vont en bateau (C√©line and Julie Go Boating). It also has an alternate ending included on the DVD, in which Susan and Roberta are invited to Egypt after helping return the earrings. They are depicted next to the pyramids on camels. Seidelman cut this scene, saying that it was unnecessary and audiences at the test screenings thought the film should have already ended much earlier (as explained on the DVD). The 1964 science fiction film The Time Travelers is playing in scenes 6 and 23 (melts at the end of the movie). All the scenes featuring Dez working as a projectionist were filmed at Bleecker Street Cinema. The scene with Roberta and Gary in their kitchen shows Roberta watching Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca. The movie was filmed during the late summer and early fall of 1984, early in Madonna's rise to popularity, and was intended to be an R-rated feature. After the success of her 1984‚Äì85 hits \\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" from her Like a Virgin album, the film was trimmed in content by Orion Pictures to get a PG-13 rating in order to also market the film to Madonna's teenage fan base. The interior/exterior shots of The Magic Club were filmed at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem. Some scenes were filmed at Danceteria, a club that Madonna frequented and which gave her a start in the music business. Separated-at-birth triplets Robert Shafran, Eddy Galland, and David Kellman have a cameo role, reportedly at Madonna's personal invitation.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was released on both vinyl and CD together with the soundtrack to the film Making Mr. Right. The soundtrack does not feature any of the other songs in the film including Madonna's \\"Into the Groove,\\" which can be found on the European 1985 re-release of Like a Virgin. The film captures the feel of the underground Bohemian/new wave scene of the early to mid-1980s New York City, a scene that helped Madonna get her big break in the music business. Madonna recorded a song for the movie, titled \\"Desperately Seeking Susan.\\" It ended up not being used in the film, and a demo she just finished at the time called \\"Into the Groove\\" was used instead. The demo version can only be heard in the movie. The song was a huge commercial success but was not included on the film's soundtrack, despite being heard in the film, because licensing restrictions involving Madonna's record label prohibited her songs from being mixed in with other artists. The video for \\"Into the Groove\\" consists of clips from the film compiled by Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions. = Track listing = Desperately Seeking Susan Making Mr. Right  Critical reception  In her review for The New Yorker, critic Pauline Kael referred to Madonna as \\"an indolent, trampy goddess.\\" The New York Times film critic Vincent Canby named the film as one of the 10 best films of 1985. Rosanna Arquette won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for her portrayal of Roberta; the fact that the award was for a \\"supporting role\\" reflected the surge in popularity that Madonna was experiencing at the time, since in terms of billing, number of scenes, lines of dialogue, and plot, Arquette was the film's lead. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Madonna also received positive reviews for her portrayal of Susan. As of January 2020, Desperately Seeking Susan holds a rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews. The critical consensus reads; \\"Desperately Seeking Susan works with its fairy tale depiction of New York and the fun, frothy chemistry generated by its two leads.\\"  Stage musical  The film was developed into a stage musical that premiered at London's Novello Theatre on November 15, 2007, following previews from October 16, 2007.

From 2002 to 2006 Smyth was the ACT Leader of the Opposition and served briefly as the Deputy Chief Minister during 2000 and 2001. He has held the ACT portfolios Urban Services, Business, Tourism and the Arts, and Police and Emergency Services. Prior to his election to the ACT Legislative Assembly he served briefly as the Member for Canberra in the Australian House of Representatives, also representing the Liberals. Career Smyth was born in Sydney and moved to Canberra in May 1969. He worked at the National Library of Australia until 1995 when, representing the Liberal Party, he contested the 1995 by-election for the House of Representatives seat of Canberra. Normally a safe Labor seat, its previous member Ros Kelly had left under a cloud, having been forced to resign her ministry a year earlier over the sports rorts affair, and Smyth received a 16.1% swing to claim the seat. At the Australian federal election on 2 March 1996, Smyth contested the new federal House of Representatives seat of Namadgi, essentially the southern portion of his old seat, even though it had been drawn with a notional Labor majority of 10.9 percent. He was defeated by Labor's Annette Ellis. To date, he is the last non-Labor member to represent an ACT-based seat. He subsequently shifted to territory politics, winning election to the Legislative Assembly in the 1998 election representing the Tuggeranong-based multimember electorate of Brindabella. He was the Opposition Leader for the ACT Liberal Party in the 2004 ACT elections, but lost the election. Smyth resigned from the ACT Legislative Assembly on 15 July 2016, to take up a newly created government position as Commissioner for International Engagement for the ACT. The ensuing casual vacancy was filled by conducting a countback of votes at the 2012 ACT election.

His timely discovery helped save many lives in the city and was credited with the inoculation of 18,000 residents. He was also the president of the Bombay Municipal Corporation. Early life Acacio Viegas was born on 1 April 1856 in Arpora, Goa. After the completion of his primary education, he joined St Xavier's High School, Bombay, where he completed his matriculation in 1874 with a distinction. He then enrolled in the Grant Medical College, securing a First Class at the L.M. & S. degree examination held in 1880. Viegas then set up practice at Mandvi in the south Bombay area. As president Not satisfied with serving the public only through medicine, he successfully contested the civic election from 1888 till 1907. In 1906 he became the President of the Municipal Corporation, enjoying the distinction of being the first native Christian to do so. He was an active member of the Standing Committee and the Improvement Trust. He then focused his attention to improving the living conditions of the city's poor and down- trodden. He also tried to minimise the increases of public utility costs. As president, Viegas promoted medical relief and introduced compulsory free education. Viegas was also a member of the Bombay University Syndicate, and was the pioneer of the Faculty of Scientific Technology. He also introduced Portuguese into the syllabus and supported the creation of special colleges for women. He was also an examiner in Medicine at the degree level and Foundation-Fellow of the College of Physicians and Surgeons. Plague In 1896, a mysterious disease hit the city in the Nowroji Hill slums. The disease spread rapidly affecting many city residents and became an epidemic. Those in the medical field were puzzled by this disease which saw a mass exodus from the city. The city's commerce was badly hit, and the flourishing textile industry was grounded. Viegas correctly diagnosed the disease as bubonic plague and tended to patients at great personal risk. He then launched a vociferous campaign to clean up slums and exterminate rats, the carriers of the plague. To confirm Viegas' findings, four teams of independent experts were brought in. With his diagnosis proving to be correct, the Governor of Bombay invited W M Haffkine, who had earlier formulated a vaccine for cholera, do the same for the epidemic. Haffkine's vaccine saved thousands of lives with Viegas personally inoculating around eighteen thousand residents. After his death in 1933, a life-size statue of him was erected in the Cowasji Jehangir Hall opposite Metro Cinema on his birth centenary in 1956, by the Governor of Bombay Presidency, Harekrushna Mahtab, as a tribute to the services rendered to the city. A street in the Dhobitalao area is also named after him.

Entertainment-Education (EE) is a communication strategy that aims to alleviate a social issue or educate the public through a custom-tailored piece of entertainment. It is defined by a set of techniques and methodologies which all aim to use various levels of mass media to communicate social and behavior change. On the impact- entertainment spectrum, EE is balanced between Social impact entertainment (SIE) and Social and behavior change communication (SBCC). The primary distinction that can be drawn to SIE is that in Entertainment-Education, the \\"impact issue\\" usually comes first; the characters and story are built around the issue. In SIE, the story usually originates projects, and impact issues are woven into or extracted out of an existing narrative. As of 2009, Entertainment-Education is defined as: \\" a theory-based communication process for purposefully embedding educational and social issues in the creation, production, processing and dissemination process of an entertainment program, in order to achieve desired individual, community, institutional, and societal changes among the intended media user population.\\"  History  In 1950, the UK-based radio soap opera The Archers broke ground by being specifically designed to educate the British people about farming issues and to help increase productivity in the postwar era of rationing and food shortages.Donovan, Paul (1991), The Radio Companion. London: Grafton; p. 8. It is the longest-running Soap Opera in the world, and is still broadcast today with millions of listeners. Miguel Sabido, a Mexican TV producer, further formalized the field. He initially called it \\"Entertainment with a proven social benefit\\" in the 1960s, which Everett Rogers re-branded as \\"Entertainment and Education\\" in 1979, and Patrick Coleman simplified as \\"Entertainment-Education\\", which is the presently used term. Miguel Sabido (center) being honored by the Population Media Center (PMC) and Population Communications International (PCI Media) with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the SBCC Summit 2018. Patrick Coleman, who coined the term \\"Entertainment- Education\\", is on the left. While the field has evolved in the last 50 years, it is still strongly based on Sabido's specific approach. Nowadays, many practitioners in Entertainment-Education come from a background of public health, health communication and behavior change communication. Sabido pioneered his method in 1967 by leveraging the Mexican tabloid Casos de Alarma to encourage readers to join the social security system of Mexico. The release of the Peruvian telenovela Simplemente Mar√≠a (1969) validated his assumptions about using mass media for social change, as the sale of sewing machines increased dramatically after the telenovela aired. Sabido went on to produce Ven conmigo, which was widely successful with a 32 point share and resulted in a million people enrolling in the adult education system of Mexico after the series' 1-year runtime. The Sabido-produced, family planning-themed telenovelas Acomp√°√±ame, Vamos juntos, caminemos and Nosotros los Mujeres followed soon after in the 1970s, which collectively resulted in a 34 percent decline of the population growth rate of Mexico. The United Nations awarded Mexico with their Population Prize after that run; United States Agency for International Development's Thomas Donnelly wrote: \\"The Televisa family planning soap operas have made the single most powerful contribution to the Mexican population success story.\\" David Poindexter of Population Communications International saw great promise in this approach, and introduced him to US-American psychologist Albert Bandura. Bandura was able to explain some of Sabido's enormous impact through his social learning theory and later went on to publish many papers on the effects of serial (radio and television) dramas. In a series of strategic meetings in the 1970s and 80s, Poindexter invited Sabido to teach his method world-wide in India, China, the Philippines, Egypt, and the Netherlands. Together with Sonny Fox, the president of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, they then organized so-called \\"Soap Summits\\" that brought together the CEOs of large American broadcasters, as well as introduce American TV writers to the methods of Entertainment-Education.Over 1,200 attendees came to the 2018 SBCC Summit, where Entertainment-Education was a main topic among Social and Behavior Change Communication professionals. Since the early days in the 1980s, a number of organizations have flourished, led by Poindexter-heritage non- profits PCI Media and Population Media Center on the actively producing side, jointly having made 140 shows that reached more than 2 Billion people and had enormous impact on prevention of HIV/AIDS, family planning and women's rights.

Its goal is to move African Americans, who it believes are the original Israelites, to Israel. The group accepts Yahweh ben Yahweh as the Son of God. In this way, its beliefs are unique and distinct from those of other Black Hebrew Israelite groups. Its founder was indicted on federal racketeering and extortion charges and convicted of conspiracy to commit murder. The group has faced accusations of being a black supremacist cult by the Southern Poverty Law Center and as a cult by The Miami Herald. The organization describes itself as follows: \\"In 1979, Yahweh Ben Yahweh came to Miami and became the Spiritual Leader and Founder of The Nation of Yahweh. Although He took a vow of poverty, in seven years He guided The Nation to amass a $250,000,000 empire. Under His direction, The Nation has grown to encompass disciples, followers, and supporters in over 1,300 cities within the U.S. and 16 other countries.\\" Criticism The SPLC has criticized the beliefs of the Nation of Yahweh as racist, stating that the group believes that blacks are the true Israelites and whites are devils. The SPLC also claims that the group believes that Yahweh ben Yahweh had a Messianic mission to vanquish whites and that it held views similar to those of the Christian Identity movement, which believes that \\"Aryans\\" are the true Israelites and non-whites are devils. The SPLC quotes Tom Metzger of White Aryan Resistance as saying, \\"[Groups like the Nation of Yahweh are] the Black counterpart of us.\\" The Anti-Defamation League has criticized the Nation of Yahweh and some other Black Hebrew sects, stating, \\"In 1987, ADL reported on Black sects holding these views [arguing that today's Jews are not the \\"chosen people\\" described in the Bible, ... instead that the label applies to people of African descent], such as the Yahwehs and the Original African Hebrew Israelite Nation of Jerusalem.\\" \\"We may be rabbis and nuns here,\\" he told The New York Times with a wide smile, \\"but we don't believe in celibacy.\\" Most followers were men; the main elders were men as well. Yahweh ben Yahweh's wife, Linda Gaines (Judith Israel) became a significant helper and leader. Gaines collected money, handled finances and the possessions of full-time workers. She had a bodyguard and was high up in the following. Current activities Despite the conviction, incarceration (until 2001), and court- mandated isolation from Nation of Yawweh, of its leader Yahweh ben Yahweh, and his death in 2007, the Nation of Yahweh is still active, and still consider Yahweh ben Yahweh to be a messiah. Its website claims to have abandoned their past racism and the leader's daughter has apparently stated that all people are children of God. An attorney who is also a member of the group, Wendelyn Rush, insists that its current war with the U.S. government is a non-violent verbal battle. The group is reportedly spread throughout the US and no longer concentrated in one location (formerly Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA). It claims that its present literature downplays and has nearly erased all past racism, and the past criminal behaviour of its leader and followers. The Nation of Yahweh is a purchaser of national infomercial time. The Nation airs a weekly half-hour program on stations across the United States, usually on weekends during little-watched early morning hours, that combines Bible studies with discussions about the Nation itself. The Yahweh ben Yahweh group appeared in the news again in 2012 after \\"Michael the Black Man\\" (real name Maurice Woodside), a former member of the group who is now a conservative activist, was invited to speak at a rally for Rick Santorum's presidential campaign during which he said that Democrats were akin to Nazis. Woodside has since become a vocal supporter of Donald Trump, but continues to defend Yahweh ben Yahweh and the Nation's beliefs.

L. Lund), (16 October 1777 ‚Äì 3 March 1867), Danish painter, was born in Kiel, Duchy of Holstein, to master painter Hans Giewert Lund and his wife Maria Magdalena Christina Bremer. An adherent of romanticism, he is known for his history paintings.  Training as artist  He came to Copenhagen to train as an artist, and in 1797, at the age of 22, he started his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art (Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi) with the support of Johan Frederik Clemens, acclaimed royal engraver and influential member of the Academy. He came quickly into contact with the rich and powerful of that time, which had a decided influence on his artistic development. He studied under neoclassicist Nikolaj Abraham Abildgaard at the Academy from 1797‚Äì1799, and taught drawing privately during his student years. He received the Academy‚Äôs small silver medallion in 1798 and the large silver medallion in 1799, but never competed for the gold medallion.  Student travels  He was friends with Caspar David Friedrich, another student at the Academy and likeminded fellow-romanticist, and traveled with him to Dresden, Germany in 1799 to continue his studies at the Dresden Academy. From there he went on to Paris, where he studied under Jacques-Louis David from 16 September 1800 to April 1802. During this time, he also took excursions to Switzerland and Lake Maggiore (August‚ÄìOctober 1801). The three Norns of Norse mythology. He went on to Italy in 1802, first to Florence and then to Rome, where he lived from 1802 to 1810. In Florence he was deeply affected by the religious art prior to Raphael‚Äôs time. He was part of the expatriate colony of Danish and German artists and scientists in Italy, which included Friederike Brun, Charlotte Humboldt, Georg Zo√´ga and Bertel Thorvaldsen. Cultured, talented and sociable, he secured himself many important contacts during this time, including those within the Danish royal house. From 1804 to 1807, he received stipends from the Academy, inclusive a travel allowance to support his stay in Italy, between 1804 and 1806. During that time and also years later during a subsequent stay in Rome, he associated himself with the German painters known as the Nazarenes, a group of romantic painters headed by Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Peter Cornelius. He studied with them the early Italian style of painting, which was then considered primitive. In 1803 and 1804 he painted a large picture, \\"Andromache i Afmagt ved Synet af Hectors mishandlede Lig\\" (\\"Andromache, Powerless at the Sight of Hector‚Äôs Maligned Corpse\\") which was seized by English pirates in 1807 on its voyage to Denmark. It was during the Napoleonic Wars when England and Denmark were enemies. This painting is now in the Danish Ambassador‚Äôs residence in Rome. A companion piece painted between 1807 and 1811, \\"Pyrrhus og Andromache ved Hectors Grav\\" (\\"Pyrrhus and Andromache at Hector‚Äôs Grave\\"), was contributed to the Danish Royal Painting Collection, now the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst), by Baron Schubart, General Consul in Livorno. These paintings helped establish himself as an idealistic and romantic painter, in contrast to rival neoclassicist Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg‚Äôs realistic approach to the visual arts. The two artists represented, for many years, opposing viewpoints and cultural ideals in the Danish art scene.  Academic career  Ida Brun, 1811 In 1809 he began attempts to secure the Academy professorship vacated by his former teacher Abildgaard upon his death in 1806. He returned to Denmark in 1810 along with Frederikke Brun in order to more actively pursue the teaching position. He began exhibiting at Charlottenborg in 1812 and exhibited there routinely until 1861. The Academy also invited him to apply for membership in 1812. He submitted the painting \\"Habor og Signe\\" (Hagbard and Signy) for consideration, and he was accepted into the Academy in 1814. While his Nordic-themed painting received praise, it was not displayed in the large painting gallery. While he received the Academy's endorsement to become member, he did not receive their recommendation to become either royal history painter or professor. The Academy, considering not only Lund‚Äôs bid for the position, but also that of his rival Eckersberg as well as that of Christian Gotlieb Kratzenstein-Stub, wished to postpone a decision until Eckersberg returned home from his student travels. Lund lost his patience with these delays and traveled back to Rome where he lived from 1816 to 1819. He had now decided to establish himself as an altar painter, and as a member of the Nazarenes. In 1818 with support from Prince Christian Frederik, he was finally named professor at the Academy along with Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg. Kratzenstein-Stub ceased being under consideration upon his death in 1816. He then returned to Copenhagen accompanied by Bertel Thorvaldsen in 1819, and married Augusta Lorentzen, daughter of the organist, Johan Henrich Lorentzen, and his wife, Frederikke Vilhelmine Lintrup, on 24 December 1820. The hiring of the two counterparts to the School of Model Painting brought new vitality to the Academy. But while Eckersberg‚Äôs star and realism were on the ascent, and he would come to be remembered as the father of the Golden Age of Danish Painting, Lund‚Äôs star and romanticism were primarily on the descent. But during his 42 years at the Academy Lund had a strong influence on his many students. He encouraged them to study 17th century Dutch landscape art, which could be readily seen in Copenhagen. His Romantic approach to art was greatly appreciated by a group of young landscape painters who were younger than Eckersberg‚Äôs pupils; they aimed to produce evocative landscapes in reaction to Eckersberg‚Äôs precise depictions of nature. This trend culminated in the large- scale landscapes of the Nationalist Romantic style, His closest students include historical painter Ditlev Blunck, and landscape painters Johan Thomas Lundbye, Dankvart Dreyer, P.C. Skovgaard, and Vilhelm Kyhn. He served as Treasurer of the Academy 1821-1832 and again 1854-1866. He stopped teaching in 1861, and was eventually titled etatsr√•d (state advisor or council). He was never named to the highest post at the Academy, Director of the Academy, unlike Eckersberg, his old rival, who served in that capacity from 1827 to 1829. He had a cheerful and positive personality and was fresh and full of life to the age of 89. He died of natural causes without any sign of sickness during his sleep. Lund kept his international orientation throughout his life in contrast to the growing nationalism and regionalism in the arts. He continued to keep his contacts in Germany and Italy.  Works  Nordic Sacrificial Scene from the Period of Odin. 1831. His main works were historical paintings with historical, mythological and biblical themes, such as the five large paintings at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, which depicted Denmark‚Äôs various cultural time periods. These include \\"Christendommens indf√∏relse i Danmark\\" (\\"Christianity‚Äôs Introduction in Denmark\\") painted in 1827, until then the largest oil painting to have been painted in Denmark. Again his assignment was matched by a comparable one given to Eckersberg. in which he painted the Oldenborg royal family line in eight large pictures, presumably to replace those painted by Abildgaard and destroyed in the fire of 1794. The other painting in Lund‚Äôs series are \\"Nordisk offerscene fra den Odinske periode\\" (\\"Nordic Sacrificial Scene from the Period of Odin\\") painted in 1831, \\"Solens tilbedelse\\" (\\"Worship of the Sun\\") painted in 1834, \\"Procession ved Kristi Legemsfest fra den katolske tid i Danmark\\" (\\"Corpus Christi Procession from Denmark‚Äôs Catholic Period\\") painted in 1834, and \\"'Luthersk gudstjeneste\\" (\\"Lutheran Church Service\\") painted in 1843. Lund‚Äôs and Eckersberg‚Äôs paintings survived the fire at Christiansborg in 1884. He is also well known for his altarpieces and paintings of religious themes, which were influenced by his admiration for such Renaissance painters as Fra Angelico, Perugino and Raphael. His small landscapes also received favour from art historian, critic and advocate of a national art movement, Niels Lauritz H√∏yen. He painted few portraits. He designed the main curtain of the Royal Theatre (Det kongelige teater) with a view of the Acropolis in 1828, which still hangs to this day. A preliminary sketch of the project is in the Theatre Museum. The Royal Theatre owns other artpieces of his. Early Italian art, his contact with the Nazarenes, fellow countryman and expatriate Bertel Thorvaldsen, and for romanticism‚Äôs ideals, all left an indelible influence on his artistic production. The Royal Library houses a collection of his letters, inclusive correspondence with younger artists that bears witness to his influence on them. He is portrayed as an old man in a painting by one of his students, Professor August Schi√∏tt, a prodigious portraitist. This portrait, considered one of his best, led to Schiott‚Äôs membership in the Academy in 1854. Lund‚Äôs works appear in various Danish art museums, including the Danish National Gallery (Statens Museum for Kunst). His works are also in the collections of several Danish castles, as well as religious works to be found at various Danish churches. He was an educated, cultured and diligent man and artist, with good contacts. He left a lasting impression by his many monumental paintings still widely on display, and by the effect he had on a generation of artists due to his long professorship at the Academy.

The role of symmetry in physics is important in simplifying solutions to many problems. Spacetime symmetries are used in the study of exact solutions of Einstein's field equations of general relativity. Spacetime symmetries are distinguished from internal symmetries. Physical motivation Physical problems are often investigated and solved by noticing features which have some form of symmetry. For example, in the Schwarzschild solution, the role of spherical symmetry is important in deriving the Schwarzschild solution and deducing the physical consequences of this symmetry (such as the nonexistence of gravitational radiation in a spherically pulsating star). In cosmological problems, symmetry plays a role in the cosmological principle, which restricts the type of universes that are consistent with large-scale observations (e.g. the Friedmann‚ÄìLema√Ætre‚ÄìRobertson‚ÄìWalker (FLRW) metric). Symmetries usually require some form of preserving property, the most important of which in general relativity include the following: *preserving geodesics of the spacetime *preserving the metric tensor *preserving the curvature tensor These and other symmetries will be discussed below in more detail. This preservation property which symmetries usually possess (alluded to above) can be used to motivate a useful definition of these symmetries themselves. Mathematical definition A rigorous definition of symmetries in general relativity has been given by Hall (2004). In this approach, the idea is to use (smooth) vector fields whose local flow diffeomorphisms preserve some property of the spacetime. (Note that one should emphasize in one's thinking this is a diffeomorphism‚Äîa transformation on a differential element. The implication is that the behavior of objects with extent may not be as manifestly symmetric.) This preserving property of the diffeomorphisms is made precise as follows. A smooth vector field on a spacetime is said to preserve a smooth tensor on (or is invariant under ) if, for each smooth local flow diffeomorphism associated with , the tensors and are equal on the domain of . This statement is equivalent to the more usable condition that the Lie derivative of the tensor under the vector field vanishes: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X T=0 on . This has the consequence that, given any two points and on , the coordinates of in a coordinate system around are equal to the coordinates of in a coordinate system around . A symmetry on the spacetime is a smooth vector field whose local flow diffeomorphisms preserve some (usually geometrical) feature of the spacetime. The (geometrical) feature may refer to specific tensors (such as the metric, or the energy-momentum tensor) or to other aspects of the spacetime such as its geodesic structure. The vector fields are sometimes referred to as collineations, symmetry vector fields or just symmetries. The set of all symmetry vector fields on forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation as can be seen from the identity: : \\\\mathcal{L}_{[X,Y]} T = \\\\mathcal{L}_X (\\\\mathcal{L}_Y T) - \\\\mathcal{L}_Y (\\\\mathcal{L}_X T) the term on the right usually being written, with an abuse of notation, as :[\\\\mathcal{L}_X, \\\\mathcal{L}_Y] T. Killing symmetry A Killing vector field is one of the most important types of symmetries and is defined to be a smooth vector field that preserves the metric tensor: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=0 This is usually written in the expanded form as: :X_{a;b}+X_{b;a} \\\\, =0 Killing vector fields find extensive applications (including in classical mechanics) and are related to conservation laws. Homothetic symmetry A homothetic vector field is one which satisfies: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=2c g_{ab} where is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of singularities in general relativity. Affine symmetry An affine vector field is one that satisfies: :(\\\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab})_{;c}=0 An affine vector field preserves geodesics and preserves the affine parameter. The above three vector field types are special cases of projective vector fields which preserve geodesics without necessarily preserving the affine parameter. Conformal symmetry A conformal vector field is one which satisfies: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X g_{ab}=\\\\phi g_{ab} where is a smooth real-valued function on . Curvature symmetry A curvature collineation is a vector field which preserves the Riemann tensor: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X {R^a}_{bcd}=0 where are the components of the Riemann tensor. The set of all smooth curvature collineations forms a Lie algebra under the Lie bracket operation (if the smoothness condition is dropped, the set of all curvature collineations need not form a Lie algebra). The Lie algebra is denoted by and may be infinite-dimensional. Every affine vector field is a curvature collineation. Matter symmetry A less well-known form of symmetry concerns vector fields that preserve the energy-momentum tensor. These are variously referred to as matter collineations or matter symmetries and are defined by: :\\\\mathcal{L}_X T_{ab}=0 where are the energy-momentum tensor components. The intimate relation between geometry and physics may be highlighted here, as the vector field is regarded as preserving certain physical quantities along the flow lines of , this being true for any two observers. In connection with this, it may be shown that every Killing vector field is a matter collineation (by the Einstein field equations, with or without cosmological constant). Thus, given a solution of the EFE, a vector field that preserves the metric necessarily preserves the corresponding energy-momentum tensor. When the energy-momentum tensor represents a perfect fluid, every Killing vector field preserves the energy density, pressure and the fluid flow vector field. When the energy-momentum tensor represents an electromagnetic field, a Killing vector field does not necessarily preserve the electric and magnetic fields. Local and global symmetriesApplications As mentioned at the start of this article, the main application of these symmetries occur in general relativity, where solutions of Einstein's equations may be classified by imposing some certain symmetries on the spacetime. =Spacetime classifications= Classifying solutions of the EFE constitutes a large part of general relativity research. Various approaches to classifying spacetimes, including using the Segre classification of the energy-momentum tensor or the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor have been studied extensively by many researchers, most notably Stephani et al. (2003). They also classify spacetimes using symmetry vector fields (especially Killing and homothetic symmetries). For example, Killing vector fields may be used to classify spacetimes, as there is a limit to the number of global, smooth Killing vector fields that a spacetime may possess (the maximum being 10 for four-dimensional spacetimes). Generally speaking, the higher the dimension of the algebra of symmetry vector fields on a spacetime, the more symmetry the spacetime admits. For example, the Schwarzschild solution has a Killing algebra of dimension 4 (three spatial rotational vector fields and a time translation), whereas the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson- Walker (FLRW) metric (excluding the Einstein static subcase) has a Killing algebra of dimension 6 (three translations and three rotations). The Einstein static metric has a Killing algebra of dimension 7 (the previous 6 plus a time translation). The assumption of a spacetime admitting a certain symmetry vector field can place restrictions on the spacetime. =List of symmetric spacetimes= The following spacetimes have their own distinct articles in Wikipedia: * Static spacetime * Stationary spacetime * Spherically symmetric spacetime See also *Field (physics) *Killing tensor *Lie groups *Noether's theorem *Ricci decomposition *Symmetry in physics *Symmetry in quantum mechanics *Derivations of the Lorentz transformations References *.

The first known story was a Kunqu script written in the Qing Dynasty, while the second version was a Cantonese opera from the early 1900s later found in Japan and Shanghai. Little information is available from this early 1900s version. The contemporary prevailing version, not meant to be historically accurate, comes from the second Cantonese opera script. The story unfolds as Princess Changping and Zhou Shixian are introduced to each other, participating in an arranged marriage. They meet and get engaged with the blessing of their parents. Her father, the emperor, is overthrown by Li Zicheng. To save herself, the Princess hides as a nun in a monastery, but she happens to meet Zhou again. After being found by the new regime, (the Qing dynasty), she follows Zhou's plan to eventually commit suicide. Zhou formulates a plan to make sure that her father is properly buried (without asking for a proper burial ceremony) while her little brother is released to safety. Zhou returns alone to negotiate with the new regime using the bargaining power vested in him by a written request from her. Once the new regime makes good on these promises, the couple return to her former home for a wedding ceremony. They take poison on their wedding night in the palace garden where they first meet. Adaptations Based on the Kunqu version and other publications, Playwright Tang Ti-sheng adaptation of this into a Cantonese opera script debuted in the Lee Theatre on 7 June 1957. Actresses Yam Kim Fai and Bak Sheut Sin were members of the original cast in leading roles. These two actresses played the leads until 1961 and then only sporadically from 1962 to 1970.

The performances of Chor Fung Ming throughout the 1970s and 1980s in newly developed satellite cities and towns were very well received. The role of male lead is extremely heavy by design and demonstrates the ‚Äòmasculine‚Äô traits of Yam style (e.g. Chinese: Ëµ∞ÈëºÈÇäËä±). The more organic actors/actresses in this role would find it more emotionally demanding. It was non-stop and exhausting after intermission.Some transcript While most well-known Tang works cater to the female leads, this is an exception. The importance of Zhou Shixian, instead of the Princess, in this 1957 version is also unique compared to other versions such as Eternal Regret of Dynasty Ming (Chinese: „ÄäÊòéÊú´ÈÅ∫ÊÅ®„Äã) and How Jing-ngo Slew the Tiger (Chinese: „ÄäË≤ûÂ®•Âà∫Ëôé„Äã), both of Peking opera.

Its original aims lay in uncovering and describing text grammars. The application of text linguistics has, however, evolved from this approach to a point in which text is viewed in much broader terms that go beyond a mere extension of traditional grammar towards an entire text. Text linguistics takes into account the form of a text, but also its setting, i. e. the way in which it is situated in an interactional, communicative context. Both the author of a (written or spoken) text as well as its addressee are taken into consideration in their respective (social and/or institutional) roles in the specific communicative context. In general it is an application of discourse analysisTrappes-Lomax, Hugh (2004) \\"Discourse analysis\\", in The Handbook of Applied Linguistics ed. by A. Davies & C. Elder. Oxford: Blackwell, pp. 133‚Äì64. at the much broader level of text, rather than just a sentence or word. IntroductionReasons for text linguistics= Much attention has been given to the sentence as a self-contained unit, and not enough has been given to studying how sentences may be used in connected stretches of language. It is essentially the presentation of language as sets of sentences. Text is extremely significant in communication because people communicate not by means of individual words or fragments of sentences in languages, but by means of texts. It is also the basis of various disciplines such as law, religion, medicine, science, and politics. =Definitions= \\"A text is an extended structure of syntactic units [i. e. text as super- sentence] such as words, groups, and clauses and textual units that is marked by both coherence among the elements and completion ... [Whereas] a non-text consists of random sequences of linguistic units such as sentences, paragraphs, or sections in any temporal and/or spatial extension.\\" (Werlich, 1976: 23)Werlich, E. (1976), A text grammar of English. Heidelberg: Quelle & Meyer. \\"A naturally occurring manifestation of language, i. e. as a communicative language event in a context. The surface text is the set of expressions actually used; these expressions make some knowledge explicit, while other knowledge remains implicit, though still applied during processing.\\" (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981: 63) De Beaugrande, R., & Dressler, W.

(1990) Discourse and the Translator. London: Longman. Text linguists generally agree that text is the natural domain of language, but they still differ in their perspectives of what constitutes a text. This variance is mainly due to the different methods of observations of different linguists, and as such, the definition of text is not yet concrete. =Significance of contexts= There is a text and there is other text that accompanies it: text that is 'with', namely the con-text. This notion of what is 'with the text', however, goes beyond what is said and written: it includes other non-verbal signs-on-the total environment in which a text unfolds. (Halliday and Hasan, 1985: 5)Halliday MAK and R Hasan. (1985) Language, Context, and Text: Aspects of Language in a Social-Semiotic Perspective. Geelong: Deakin University. According to Halliday, text is a sign representation of a socio-cultural event embedded in a context of situation. Context of situation is the semio-socio-cultural environment in which the text unfolds. Text and context are so intimately related that neither concept can be comprehended in the absence of the other. =Three features of context of situationThe field of discourse ‚Äì experiential meaning This is the meaning that the social actions and the engagements of the participants are giving to the understanding of the text.Kavcic, A. (2008) Text linguistics. Informally published manuscript, English and German Studies, Retrieved from www.englistika.info/podatki/3_letnik/besediloslovje-I-izpiski.doc The tenor of discourse ‚Äì interpersonal meaning This is the meaning that the roles of and relationships among participants give to the understanding of the text. These relationships may be permanent or temporary. The contribution to meaning by social statuses of the participants also fall within this feature. The mode of discourse ‚Äì logical meaning This is the meaning that the language, written or spoken, gives to the understanding of the text. This includes the symbolic organization of the text, as well as its intended function within the context. =Texture = Texture is the basis for unity and semantic interdependence within text. Any text that lacks texture would simply be a bunch of isolated sentences that have no relationship to each other. (Crane, 1994) A feature of texture is \\"sequential implicativeness\\", as suggested by Schegloff and Sacks (1974). This refers to the property of language that each line in a text is linked from or linked to the previous line. As such, language contains a linear sequence, and this linear progression of text creates a context of meaning.Schegloff, E.A. and Sacks, H. (1974) \\"Opening up Closings\\", Semiotica 7(4): 289‚Äì327 (reprinted in Turner, R 1974 \\"'Ethnomethodology: selected readings,'\\" Harmondsworth: Penguin) This contextual meaning, at the paragraph level, is referred to as \\"coherence\\", while the internal properties of meaning are referred to as \\"cohesion\\". (Eggins, 1994: 85)Eggins, S. (1994) An Introduction to Systemic Functional Linguistics London: Pinter There are two aspects of coherence, namely, \\"situational\\" coherence and \\"generic\\" coherence. There is situational coherence when field, tenor, and mode can be identified for a certain group of clauses. On the other hand, there is generic coherence when the text can be recognized as belonging to a certain genre. Thereby, cohesion is the result of \\"semantic ties\\", which refers to the dependent links between items within a text. These ties come together to create meaning. Texture is, therefore, created within text when the properties of coherence and cohesion are present. =Text types= Most linguists agree on the classification into five text- types: narrative, descriptive, argumentative, instructive, and comparison/contrast (also called expositive). Some classifications divide the types of texts according to their function. Others differ because they take into consideration the topic of the texts, the producer and the addressee, or the style. Adam and Petitjean, (1989) proposed analyzing of overlaps of different text types with text sequences. Virtanen (1992) establishes a double classification (discourse type and text type) to be used when the Identification text-text type is not straightforward. Structure As a science of text, text linguistics describes or explains among different types of text the: * Shared features * Distinct features Text linguistics is the study of how texts function in human interaction. Beaugrande and Dressler define a text as a ‚Äúcommunicative occurrence which meets seven standards of textuality‚Äù ‚Äì Cohesion, Coherence, Intentionality, Acceptability, Informativity, Situationality and Intertextuality, without any of which the text will not be communicative. Non-communicative texts are treated as non- texts. =Cohesion= Surface texts are the exact words that people see or hear. Cohesion concerns the ways in which the components of the surface text are connected within a sequence. Grammatical forms and conventions are adhered to by surface components and therefore cohesion rests upon grammatical dependencies. The grammatical dependencies in surface texts are major signals for sorting out meanings and uses. Cohesion encompasses all of the functions that can be used to signal relations among surface elements. Such a text can be divided up into various dependencies. Someone might construe it as a notice about \\"slow cars\\" that are \\"held up\\", so that conclusions could be drawn about the need to drive fast to avoid being held up. However, it is more likely for one to divide the text into \\"slow\\" and \\"cars held up', so that drivers will drive slowly to avoid accidents or take alternative routes to avoid being caught in the slow traffic. A science of text should explain how ambiguities such as this are possible, as well as how they are precluded or resolved without much difficulty. For efficient communication to take place there must be interaction between cohesion and other standards of textuality because the surface alone is not decisive. =Coherence= Coherence concerns the ways in which concepts and relations, which underlie the surface text, are linked, relevant and used, to achieve efficient communication. * A concept is a cognitive content which can be retrieved or triggered with a high degree of consistency in the mind * Relations are the links between concepts within a text, with each link identified with the concept that it connects to Surface texts may not always express relations explicitly therefore people supply as many relations as are needed to make sense out of any particular text. In the example of the road sign \\"SLOW CARS HELD UP', \\"cars\\" is an object concept and \\"held up\\" an action concept, and the \\"cars\\" are the link to \\"held up'. Therefore, \\"slow\\" is more likely to be interpreted as a motion than as the speed at which cars are travelling. Types of relations include: ;I. Causality: The event of \\"raining\\" causes the event of \\"washing the spider out\\" because it creates the necessary conditions for the latter; without the rain, the spider will not be washed out. ;II. Enablement: The action of sitting on the wall created the necessary but not sufficient conditions for the action of falling down. Sitting on a wall makes it possible but not obligatory for falling down to occur. ;III. Reason: In contrast to the rain which causes Itsy Bitsy spider to be washed out, the slow working does not actually cause or enable the low wage. Instead, the low wage is a reasonable outcome; \\"reason\\" is used to term actions that occur as a rational response to a previous event. ;IV. Purpose: In contrast to Humpty Dumpty's action of sitting on the wall which enables the action of falling down, there is a plan involved here; Humpty Dumpty did not sit on the wall so that it could fall down but Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard so that she could get a bone. \\"Purpose\\" is used to term events that are planned to be made possible via a previous event. ;V. Time: \\"Cause\\", \\"enablement\\" and \\"reason\\" have forward directionality with the earlier event causing, enabling or providing reason for the later event. \\"Purpose', however, has a backward directionality as the later event provides the purpose for the earlier event. More than just a feature of texts, coherence is also the outcome of cognitive processes among text users. The nearness and proximity of events in a text will trigger operations which recover or create coherence relations. : In the explicit text, there is a set of actions (making, stealing and calling); the only relations presented are the agent and the affected entity of each action. However, a text receiver is likely to assume that the locations of all three events are close to one another as well as occur in a continuous and relatively short time frame. One might also assume that the actions are meant to signal the attributes of the agents; the Queen is skilled in cooking, the Knave is dishonest and the King is authoritative. As such, coherence encompasses inferencing based on one's knowledge. For a text to make sense, there has to be interaction between one's accumulated knowledge and the text-presented knowledge. Therefore, a science of texts is probabilistic instead of deterministic, that is, inferences by users of any particular text will be similar most of the time instead of all of the time. Most text users have a common core of cognitive composition, engagement and process such that their interpretations of texts through \\"sensing\\" are similar to what text senders intend them to be. Without cohesion and coherence, communication would be slowed down and could break down altogether. Cohesion and coherence are text-centred notions, designating operations directed at the text materials. =Intentionality= Intentionality concerns the text producer's attitude and intentions as the text producer uses cohesion and coherence to attain a goal specified in a plan. Without cohesion and coherence, intended goals may not be achieved due to a breakdown of communication. However, depending on the conditions and situations in which the text is used, the goal may still be attained even when cohesion and coherence are not upheld. Even though cohesion is not maintained in this example, the text producer still succeeds in achieving the goal of finding out if the text receiver wanted a piggyback. =Acceptability= Acceptability concerns the text receiver's attitude that the text should constitute useful or relevant details or information worth accepting. Text type, the desirability of goals and the political and sociocultural setting, as well as cohesion and coherence, are important in influencing the acceptability of a text. Text producers often speculate on the receiver's attitude of acceptability and present texts that maximize the probability that the receivers will respond as desired by the producers. For example, texts that are open to a wide range of interpretations, such as \\"Call us before you dig. You may not be able to afterwards\\" require more inferences about the related consequences. This is more effective than an explicit version of the message that informs receivers the full consequences of digging without calling, because receivers are left with great uncertainty as to the consequences that could result; this plays to people's risk aversion. =Informativity= Informativity concerns the extent to which the contents of a text are already known or expected as compared to unknown or unexpected. No matter how expected or predictable content may be, a text will always be informative at least to a certain degree due to unforeseen variability. The processing of highly informative text demands greater cognitive ability but at the same time is more interesting. The level of informativity should not exceed a point such that the text becomes too complicated and communication is endangered. Conversely, the level of informativity should also not be so low that it results in boredom and the rejection of the text. =Situationality= Situationality concerns the factors which make a text relevant to a situation of occurrence. The situation in which a text is exchanged influences the comprehension of the text. There may be different interpretations with the road sign However, the most likely interpretation of the text is obvious because the situation in which the text is presented provides the context which influences how text receivers interpret the text. The group of receivers (motorists) who are required to provide a particular action will find it more reasonable to assume that \\"slow\\" requires them to slow down rather than referring to the speed of the cars that are ahead. Pedestrians can tell easily that the text is not directed towards them because varying their speeds is inconsequential and irrelevant to the situation. In this way, the situation decides the sense and use of the text. Situationality can affect the means of cohesion; less cohesive text may be more appropriate than more cohesive text depending on the situation. If the road sign was \\"Motorists should reduce their speed and proceed slowly because the vehicles ahead are held up by road works, therefore proceeding at too high a speed may result in an accident', every possible doubt of intended receivers and intention would be removed. However, motorists only have a very short amount of time and attention to focus on and react to road signs. Therefore, in such a case, economical use of text is much more effective and appropriate than a fully cohesive text. =Intertextuality= Intertextuality concerns the factors which make the utilization of one text dependent upon knowledge of one or more previously encountered text. If a text receiver does not have prior knowledge of a relevant text, communication may break down because the understanding of the current text is obscured. Texts such as parodies, rebuttals, forums and classes in school, the text producer has to refer to prior texts while the text receivers have to have knowledge of the prior texts for communication to be efficient or even occur. In other text types such as puns, for example \\"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana', there is no need to refer to any other text. Main contributorsRobert-Alain de Beaugrande= Robert-Alain de Beaugrande was a text linguist and a discourse analyst, one of the leading figures of the Continental tradition in the discipline. He was one of the developers of the Vienna School of Textlinguistik (Department of Linguistics at the University of Vienna), and published the seminal Introduction to Text Linguistics in 1981, with Wolfgang U. Dressler. He was also a major figure in the consolidation of critical discourse analysis. Application to language learning Text linguistics stimulates reading by arousing interest in texts or novels. Increases background knowledge on literature and on different kinds of publications. Writing skills can be improved by familiarizing and duplicating specific text structures and the use of specialized vocabulary.

His first title shot was on July 12, 1990 when he challenged Masanobu Fuchi for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship but he came up short.http://www.purolove.com/ajpw/history/ajpwjrhwdefenses.php#8 He challenged for the title four more times between January 26, 1991 to February 28, 1993 coming up short each time.http://www.purolove.com/ajpw/history/ajpwjrhwdefenses.php#8 By 1991, Kikuchi also began teaming with future legend: Kenta Kobashi. The two first received a shot at the vacated All Asia Tag Team Championship on April 6, 1991 against The British Bruisers but lost. A few months later on June 1, 1991 they received another shot against then-champions Doug Furnas and Dan Kroffat but failed to win the titles. Kikuchi and Kobashi also entered the 1991 World's Strongest Tag Determination League but finished 11th place with 4 points. On May 25, 1992 Kikuchi and Kobashi again challenge Furnas and Kroffat for the All Asia Tag Team Titles and this time was victorious as Kikuchi won his first title. Along with the title win, the match won numerous honors as the Wrestling Observer Newsletter gave it 5 Stars and named it the 1992 Match of the Year. During the title reign, Kikuchi also enjoyed success in the Junior Division by winning the yearly January 3 Junior Heavyweight Korakuen Hall Battle Royal on January 3, 1993http://www.prowrestlinghistory.com/ and also won a Junior Heavyweight Tournament on January 31, 1993. After a year as champions, Kikuchi and Kobashi lost the titles on June 2, 1993 to The Patriot and The Eagle.

It is part of IBM's Deep Computing initiative that also produced the Deep Blue chess computer. Deep Thunder is intended to provide local, high-resolution weather predictions customized to weather-sensitive specific business operations. For example, it could be used to predict the wind velocity at an Olympic diving platform, destructive thunderstorms, and combined with other physical models to predict where there will be flooding, damaged power lines and algal blooms. The project is now headquartered at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.  History  The Deep Thunder project is headed by Lloyd Treinish, who joined IBM in 1990, after working for 12 years at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The project began in 1995 as an outgrowth from a project designed to help provide accurate weather forecasts for the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games. In collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, IBM scientists built one of the first parallel processing supercomputers to be used for weather modeling, based on the IBM RS/6000 SP. It was installed at the National Weather Service office in Peachtree City, Georgia, in 1996, where it ran for several months and produced multiple forecasts daily. After a few years of development, the team set up an implementation in New York City in 2001 to test the project. The group is currently working on establishing the Rio de Janeiro operations center. The name Deep Thunder arose after the IBM Deep Blue system played and defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in May, 1997. In the following November, a journalist used the name Deep Thunder in an article, which stuck with the developers. Current members of Deep Thunder are Lloyd Treinish, Anthony Praino, Campbell Watson and Mukul Tewari.  Technology  Deep Thunder uses a 3D telescoping grid where data from one model feeds into another and is verified with historical data. For example, they start off with a global model from NOAA, and as they zoom in the resolution decreases exponentially, down to models with resolutions of 1 kilometer, and sometimes as small as 1 meter. Using this method, IBM is able to cut down on the amount of processing required. IBM uses many sources of data to feed Deep Thunder, including public satellite sources, and many other private sources, as well as whatever local sensors and data a location may have. The Watson computer system will be used to generate the Deep Thunder weather forecasts. Input data will be collected from over 200,000 Weather Underground personal weather stations, weather satellite data, smartphone barometer and data from other sources.  Applications  Utility Companies = IBM worked with a North American utility company that has over 90,000 poles, wires, and transformers to develop a prediction service that can pinpoint where incoming storms will bring down trees and power lines. The service can be used to call in the needed number of repair crews and station them near where the damage will occur, drastically decreasing downtime.http://earthnetworks.com/Portals/0/pdf/IBM_Deep_Thunder_Case_Study.pdf = Agriculture = Deep Thunder could be used to determine optimal times to plant, irrigate, and harvest crops, based on the dynamic environmental conditions of individual farm locations. Precision agriculture using Deep Thunder could lead to better price points for crops by saving water, by allocating labor more effectively, and by improving supply chain efficiency. Using these methods of predictive weather farming, crop losses from weather can be cut by over 25%. The island nation of Brunei is working with Deep Thunder to develop precision weather forecast models to increase rice production. = In The Olympics = Deep Thunder was used during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games to accurately predict that there would be no rain during the closing ceremony. It is also intended to be used for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. = The Jefferson Project = The Jefferson Project at Lake George (New York) is a global example of sustained protection of freshwater ecosystems. The project uses Deep Thunder to predict the weather at an unprecedented 333 m resolution, simulating complex airflow patterns over the lake that are crucial to lake currents and nutrient cycling. = New York = New York City was the first city to test a full scale implementation of Deep Thunder. IBM is experimenting with using a mobile app to distribute location-specific predictions and to issue alerts. Data from the app can be used by maintenance crews to determine if wind levels are too high to work, or it could be used to get a weather forecast at a certain address. = Rio de Janeiro = IBM is currently expanding the project to Rio de Janeiro in order to predict floods, and anticipate where storms might trigger mudslides. The city is collaborating with IBM on a multimillion-dollar plan to improve emergency responsiveness, by providing comprehensive information about rainfall estimates, wind speed and direction, probabilities of landslides and floods to responders. It is expected to be utilized during the 2014 FIFA World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. = Dublin, Ireland = The Dublin City Council is working with IBM to help make Dublin, Ireland, the third city in the world to implement the Deep Thunder forecasting model in an attempt to predict and issue warnings about incoming flash floods that are impacting businesses and homeowners.

Life According to James Lynch, Fihely was a native of Clonfert in Galway, but according to James Ware and Anthony √† Wood he was a native of Baltimore, County Cork. Part of his education was received at the University of Oxford, where he joined the Franciscans. Later he studied at the University of Padua, where he obtained the degree of Doctor of Divinity. After his ordination he was appointed professor of philosophy at Padua. O'Fihely acted for some time as corrector of proofs to two well-known publishers at Venice, Scott and Locatelli ‚Äîin the early days of printing a task usually entrusted to very learned men‚Äî and he was one of the first Irishmen to engage with the new technology of the printing press. O'Fihely was acknowledged as one of the most learned men of his time. In 1506 he was appointed as Archbishop of Tuam and was consecrated at Rome by Pope Julius II. In 1513 he received a Scholastic Accolade from the Church, styled as Doctor Flos Mundi, and has been the only Irish person to receive one so far. He did not return to Ireland till 1513, in the meantime attending as Archbishop of Tuam the first two sessions of the Fifth Lateran Council (1512). On leaving for Ireland to take formal possession of his see, O'Fihely procured from the pope an indulgence for all those who would be present at his first Mass in Tuam. However, he was destined not to reach Tuam, for he fell ill in Galway and died there in the Franciscan convent.

Its composition was brief in comparison with the 21 years it took Brahms to complete his First Symphony. The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, and strings. The cheery and almost pastoral mood of the symphony often invites comparisons with Beethoven's Sixth Symphony, but, perhaps mischievously, Brahms wrote to his publisher on November 22, 1877, that the symphony \\"is so melancholy that you will not be able to bear it. I have never written anything so sad, and the score must come out in mourning.\\" The premiere was given in Vienna on 30 December 1877 by the Vienna Philharmonic under the direction of Hans Richter; Walter Frisch notes that it had originally been scheduled for 9 December, but \\"in one of those little ironies of music history, it had to be postponed [because] the players were so preoccupied with learning Das Rheingold by Richard Wagner.\\"Walter Frisch, Brahms: The Four Symphonies, New York, 1996: Schirmer Books, p. 68. A typical performance lasts between 40 and 50 minutes. Movements In the Second Symphony, Brahms preserved the structural principles of the classical symphony, in which two lively outer movements frame a slow second movement followed by a short scherzo: page=90 page=91 page=92 page=93 =I. Allegro non troppo= The cellos and double-basses start the first-movement sonata form in a tranquil mood by introducing the first phrase of the principal theme, which is continued by the horns. The woodwinds develop the section and other instruments join in gradually progressing to a full-bodied forte (at bar 58). At bar 82, the violas and cellos introduce the movement's second \\"Lullaby\\" theme in F-sharp minor, which eventually moves to A major. After a development section based mostly on motives of the principal theme group, the recapitulation begins at bar 302, with the second theme returning at bar 350. Towards the conclusion of the movement, Brahms marked bar 497 as in tempo, sempre tranquillo, and it is this mood which pervades the remainder of the movement as it closes in the home key of D major. The second theme's opening bars are recognizable for their passing resemblance to ', Op. 49, the tune commonly referred to as \\"Brahms's Lullaby\\". It is introduced at bar 82 and is continually brought back, reshaped and changed both rhythmically and harmonically. =II. Adagio non troppo= This movement is characterised by the use of developing variation. A brooding theme introduced by the cellos from bars 1 to 12, with a counter-melody in the bassoons, begins the second movement. A second theme, marked ', appears in bar 33. After a brief development section, the recapitulation of the first theme (the second theme is absent) is highly modified. The movement then finishes with a coda-like section in which the main theme is reintroduced in the end. =III. Allegretto grazioso (quasi andantino)= The third movement minuet opens with pizzicato cellos accompanying a lilting oboe melody in G major. A contrasting section in time marked Presto ma non assai begins in the strings, and this theme is soon taken over by the full orchestra (minus trumpets). Bar 107 returns to the main tempo and gentle mood, but the idyll setting is again disrupted in bar 126 when the earlier Presto marking makes a re-entry, this time in a variation. Brahms yet again diverts the movement back into its principal tempo (bar 194) and thereafter to its peaceful close. The third movement contains very light articulated sections, very similar in character to the Slavonic Dances of Brahms' contemporary, Dvo≈ô√°k. This lighter element provides a contrast to the previous two movements. =IV. Allegro con spirito= Mysterious sotto voce strings open the final Allegro con spirito, again in sonata form. The full orchestra suddenly announces the arrival of the main theme, unveiling \\"...the blazing sunrise of the most athletic and ebulliently festive movement Brahms ever wrote\\". As the initial excitement fades, violins introduce a new subject in A major marked largamente (to be played broadly). The wind instruments repeat this until it develops into a climax. Bar 155 of the movement repeats the symphony's first subject again, but instead of the joyful outburst heard earlier, Brahms introduces the movement's development section. A mid-movement tranquillo section (bar 206, and reappearing in the coda) elaborates earlier material and slows down the movement to allow a buildup of energy into the recapitulation. The first theme comes in again (bar 244) and the familiar orchestral forte is played. The second theme also reappears in the tonic key. Towards the end of the symphony, descending chords and a mazy run of notes by various instruments of the orchestra (bars 395 to 412) sound out the second theme again but this time drowned out in a blaze of brass instruments as the symphony ends in a triumphant mood.

Born into an academic family (his father was the mathematician Johannes Hjelmslev), Hjelmslev studied comparative linguistics in Copenhagen, Prague and Paris (with Antoine Meillet and Joseph Vendryes, among others). In 1931, he founded the Cercle Linguistique de Copenhague. Together with Hans J√∏rgen Uldall he developed a structuralist theory of language which he called glossematics, which further developed the semiotic theory of Ferdinand de Saussure. Glossematics as a theory of language is characterized by a high degree of formalism. It is interested in describing the formal and semantic characteristics of language in a strict separation from sociology, psychology or neurobiology, and has a high degree of logical rigour. Hjelmslev regarded linguistics ‚Äî or glossematics ‚Äî as a formal science. He was the inventor of formal linguistics. Hjelmslev's theory became widely influential in structural and functional grammar, and in semiotics.  The Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen  The Linguistic Circle of Copenhagen was founded by Hjelmslev and a group of Danish colleagues on 24 September 1931. Their main inspiration was the Prague Linguistic Circle, which had been founded in 1926. It was, in the first place, a forum for discussion of theoretical and methodological problems in linguistics. Initially, their interest lay mainly in developing an alternative concept of the phoneme, but it later developed into a complete theory which was coined glossematics, and was notably influenced by structuralism. Membership of the group grew rapidly and a significant list of publications resulted, including an irregular series of larger works under the name Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Copenhague. A Bulletin was produced, followed by an international journal for structuralistic research in language, Acta Linguistica (later called Acta Linguistica Hafniensia), which was founded with the members of the Prague Linguistic Circle. It was, at that time, the sole journal explicitly dedicated to structuralism. With one short break from 1934 to 1937, while he lectured at the university of Aarhus, Hjelmslev acted as chairman of the Circle until shortly before his death in 1965.  Theoretical work  Hjelmslev published his first paper at the age of 25. His first major book, Principes de grammaire g√©n√©rale, which he finished in 1928, is an invaluable source for anyone interested in Hjelmslev's work. During the 1930s Hjelmslev wrote another book, La cat√©gorie des cas, which was a major contribution to linguistics. In this book, Hjelmslev analysed the general category of case in detail, providing ample empirical material supporting his hypotheses. It is important to read Hjelmslev's work as a continuous evolving theory on the epistemology of linguistics. He made his first academic journey at 1921 to Lithuania to study Lithuanian, an experience which can be traced throughout his works. His most well-known book, Omkring sprogteoriens grundl√¶ggelse, or in English translation, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, first published in 1943, critiques the then-prevailing methodologies in linguistics as being descriptive, even anecdotal, and not systematising. He proposed a linguistic theory intended to form the basis of a more rational linguistics and a contribution to general epistemology. Like Ferdinand de Saussure (1857‚Äì1913), he accepted language as a system of signs, from the point of view of language use. He argued that a theory of semiotics should be consistent within itself, comprehensive, and as simple as possible.Oller et al. (1999) =Hjelmslev's sign model= Hjelmslev's sign model is a development of Saussure's bilateral sign model. Saussure considered a sign as having two sides, signifier and signified. Hjelmslev's famously renamed signifier and signified as respectively expression plane and content plane, and also distinguished between form and substance.Deleuze and Guattari (1980)Groupe ¬µ (1976)Metcalf The combinations of the four would distinguish between form of content, form of expression, substance of content, and substance of expression.N√∂th (1990) In Hjelmslev's analysis, a sign is a function between two forms, the content form and the expression form, and this is the starting point of linguistic analysis. However, every sign function is also manifested by two substances: the content substance and the expression substance. The content substance is the physical and conceptual manifestation of the sign. The expression substance is the physical substance wherein a sign is manifested. This substance can be sound, as is the case for most known languages, but it can be any material support whatsoever, for instance, hand movements, as is the case for sign languages, or distinctive marks on a suitable medium as in the many different writing systems of the world. In short, Hjelmslev was proposing an open-ended, scientific method of analysis as a new semiotics. In proposing this, he was reacting against the conventional view in phonetics that sounds should be the focus of enquiry. Some have interpreted his work as if Hjelmslev argued that no sign can be interpreted unless it is contextualisedtreating his functives, expression and content as the general connotative mechanisms (for instance by Algirdas Julius Greimas)for Hjelmslev the point of view of the linguist on meaning is that of the form of content. Even if the content substance is important, one has to analyse it from the point of view of the form. Not only do pictures and literature manifest the same organising principles, but, more broadly, seeing and hearing, though certainly not identical, interact in surprisingly complex ways at deeper levels of the sign hierarchy which Hjelmslev sought to understand.  Assessment  Hjelmslev made a bold proposal to transform technical analysis into a broad enquiry, emphasising that the true focus of linguistics should be the language and the human culture that continually reinvents it, and all society's memory of its accumulated knowledge preserved through language. This was a challenging but constructive argument at the time, and remains one that still has relevance today. Most conspicuously, Hjelmslev's lines of inquiry have been taken up by Gilles Deleuze and F√©lix Guattari (see the \\"Postulates of Linguistics\\" and \\"Geology of Morals\\" chapters of A Thousand Plateaus), and subsequently their followers.  Terminology  Hjelmslev introduced the terms glosseme, ceneme, prosodeme and plereme as linguistic units, analogous to phoneme, morpheme, etc.Desblanche, Lucile (2001). Aspects of specialised translation, p. 153\\\\. Google Books. Also, his most famous work, Prolegomena to a Theory of Language, is mostly concerned with the formal definition of a terminology for the analysis of any level of a system of signs, and as such there exists an exclusively Hjelmslevian terminology for that.

Fillmore (August 9, 1929 ‚Äì February 13, 2014) was an American linguist and Professor of Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He received his Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Michigan in 1961. Fillmore spent ten years at The Ohio State University and a year as a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University before joining Berkeley's Department of Linguistics in 1971. Fillmore was extremely influential in the areas of syntax and lexical semantics. A three‚Äìday conference was held at UC Berkeley in celebration of his 80th birthday in 2009. Fillmore received the 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Computational Linguistics. He died in 2014. Early years Fillmore spent three years in the U.S. Army stationed in Japan, where he intercepted coded Russian conversations on short-wave radio and taught himself Japanese. Following his discharge, he taught English at a Buddhist girls' school while also taking classes at Kyoto University. He returned to the US, receiving his doctorate at the University of Michigan and then teaching at The Ohio State University in Columbus. At the time, he was still a proponent of Noam Chomsky's theory of generative grammar during its earliest transformational grammar phase. In 1963, his seminal article The position of embedding transformations in a Grammar introduced the transformational cycle. The central idea is to first apply rules to the smallest applicable unit, then to the smallest unit containing that one, and so on. This principle has been a foundational insight for theories of syntax since that time. Cognitive linguistics By 1965, Fillmore had come to acknowledge that semantics plays a crucial role in grammar. In 1968, he published his theory of Case Grammar (Fillmore 1968), which highlighted the fact that syntactic structure can be predicted by semantic participants. An action can have an agent, a patient, purposes, locations, and so on. These participants were called \\"cases\\" in his original paper, but later came to be known as semantic roles or thematic relations, which are similar to theta roles in generative grammar. Following his move to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971, this theory eventually evolved into a broader cognitive linguistic theory called Frame Semantics (1976). A commercial event, for instance, crucially involved elements such as a seller, a buyer, some good, and some money. In language, such an event can be expressed in a variety of different ways, e.g. using the verb 'to sell' or the verb 'to buy'. According to frame semantics, meaning is best studied in terms of the mental concepts and participants in the minds of the speaker and addressee. Around the same time, Fillmore's Santa Cruz Lectures on Deixis, delivered in 1971 and published in 1975, contributed to establishing the field of linguistic pragmatics, which studies the relationship between linguistic form and the context of utterance. In all of this research, he illuminated the fundamental importance of semantics, and its role in motivating syntactic and morphological phenomena. His collaboration with Paul Kay and George Lakoff was generalized into the theory of Construction Grammar. This work aimed at developing a complete theory of grammar that would fully acknowledge the role of semantics right from the start, while simultaneously adopting constraint- based formalisms as popular in computer science and natural language processing. This theory built on the notion of construction from traditional and pedagogical grammars rather than the rule-based formalisms that dominate most of generative grammar. One of Fillmore's most widely noticed works of the time (with Paul Kay and Cathy O'Connor) appeared in 'Language' in 1988 as \\"Regularity and Idiomaticity in Grammatical Constructions: The Case of Let Alone\\". Their paper highlighted the merits of such a theory of by focusing on the 'let alone' construction. Over time, construction grammar developed into a research area of its own, and a number of variants have been proposed over the years by different researchers. Fillmore is now widely recognized as one of the founders of cognitive linguistics. The first chapter of ‚ÄúCognitive Linguistics‚Äù by Cruse and Croft (2004), for instance, begins with a summary of Fillmore's work. Fillmore served as President of the Linguistic Society of America in 1991 and was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago in 2000. His legacy continues with his many notable students, including Adele Goldberg, Laura Michaelis, Christopher Johnson, Miriam R. L. Petruck, Len Talmy, and Eve Sweetser. FrameNet In the 1990s, Fillmore taught classes in computational lexicography at the University of Pisa, where he met Sue Atkins, who was conducting frame-semantic analyses from a lexicographic perspective. In their subsequent discussions and collaborations, Fillmore came to acknowledge the importance of considering corpus data. They discussed the \\"dictionary of the future\\", in which every word would be linked to example sentences from corpora. After 23 years at the University of California, Berkeley, Fillmore retired in 1994 and joined Berkeley's International Computer Science Institute. There, he started a project called FrameNet, an on-line structured description of the English lexicon implementing much of what he had earlier proposed more theoretically in his theory of Frame semantics, while implementing the idea of emphasizing example sentences from corpora. In FrameNet, words are described in terms of the frames they evoke. Data is gathered from the British National Corpus, annotated for semantic and syntactic relations, and stored in a database organized by both lexical items and Frames. FrameNet has inspired parallel projects, which investigate other languages, including Spanish, German, and Japanese. Due to the project's influence, issue 16 of the International Journal of Lexicography was devoted entirely to FrameNet. The project has been highly influential in computational linguistics and natural language processing as well. FrameNet led to the establishment of the task of shallow semantic parsing or automatic semantic role labelling (SRL). The first automatic SRL system was developed by Berkeley graduate student Daniel Gildea. Semantic Role Labelling has since become one of the standard NLP tasks. In recognition of his contributions to computational linguistics, Fillmore received the 2012 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Association for Computational Linguistics. Together with Collin F. Baker, he also received the 2012 Antonio Zampolli Prize, awarded by the European Language Resources Association.

Biography  Otokichi was from Mihama, Aichi Prefecture. In 1832, at age 14, he served as a crew member on a rice transport ship bound for Edo, the Hojunmaru (ÂÆùÈ†Ü‰∏∏), in length with a cargo of 150 tons and a crew of 14. The ship left on October 11, 1832, but was caught in a storm and blown off-course far out in the Pacific Ocean. =Drift to America= The ship, without a mast or a rudder, was carried across the northern Pacific Ocean by currents. It drifted for 14 months, during which the crew lived on desalinated seawater and on the rice of their cargo. Several crew members died of scurvy; only three survived by the time they arrived at Cape Alava, the westernmost point of Washington's Olympic Peninsula, in 1834. The three survivors were Iwakichi, 29; Kyukichi, 16; and Otokichi, then 15. The three castaways were looked after and briefly enslaved by the Makah Indian tribe. They were later handed over to John McLoughlin, the Chief Factor (agent) for the Columbia District at the Hudson's Bay Company. =Travel to Europe= McLoughlin, envisioning an opportunity to use the castaways to open trade with Japan, sent the trio to London on the Eagle to try to convince the Crown of his plan. They reached London in 1835, probably the first Japanese to do so since Christopher and Cosmas in the 16th century. The British Government ultimately denied interest in the enterprise, and the castaways were instead dispatched to Macau on board the General Palmer, so that they could be returned to their home country. =Macau and attempt to return to Japan= Morrison, anchored in front of Uraga in 1837. Once in Macau, Otokichi, Kyukichi and Iwakichi were welcomed by Karl Gutzlaff, a German missionary and Chinese translator for the British Government. Gutzlaff, who had views on evangelizing Japan, enthusiastically learned the Japanese language from the trio, and with their help managed to make a translation of the Gospel of John into Japanese. The trio was joined in Macau by four more castaways from Kumamoto Prefecture in Ky≈´sh≈´, who had been shipwrecked on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. An opportunity to return them to Japan appeared, when the American trader Charles W. King offered to take them back to Japan, again with the hope of establishing trade relations with the country. In July 1837, the seven castaways left with Charles W. King on board the Morrison to Uraga at the entrance of Edo Bay. There the ship was fired on repeatedly, and King was not able to accomplish his objective to establish diplomatic contact. He then went to Kagoshima, but again met with cannon fire, and finally decided to abandon his efforts and go back to Canton. The castaways resigned themselves to a life in exile. Returning to Japan was problematic, for this was during Japan's period of isolation where leaving the country was an offense that was punishable by death. =New life abroad= Unable to return to Japan, the castaways started a new life in Macau. They seem to have worked as translators for the British trade legation and British missionaries. Otokichi is next recorded to have been working for the British trading company Dent & Co. in Shanghai in 1843. He apparently also worked as a crewman on American ships, and worked at helping Japanese castaways to return to Japan on board Chinese or Dutch ships, the only ones allowed to visit the country. He also engaged in business on his own behalf. Otokichi married a Scotswoman in Macao who later died of illness. His second wife, Louisa Belder, was half-German and half- Malay, living in Singapore, with whom he had a son and three daughters. He became a naturalized British subject, taking the name John Matthew Ottoson. \\"Ottoson\\" is said to have been a transliteration of \\"Oto-san\\" (literally \\"Mr. Oto\\"), a respectful nickname used by his Japanese friends. =Return to Japan= Otokichi is known to have returned to Japan twice, first as a translator on board HMS Mariner, which entered Uraga Port in 1849 to conduct a topographical survey. To avoid problems with Japanese authorities, he disguised himself as Chinese, and said that he had learned Japanese from his father, allegedly a businessman who had worked in relation with Nagasaki. The second time, Otokichi went to Japan under his British name \\"Ottoson\\", in September 1854. He was a member of the British fleet under Admiral James Stirling. The fleet docked at Nagasaki and negotiated and signed the Anglo- Japanese Friendship Treaty on October 14. On that occasion, Otokichi met with many Japanese, including Fukuzawa Yukichi. He was apparently offered permission to live in Japan, but he chose to return to his family in Shanghai. Toward the end of his life, Otokichi moved from Shanghai to Singapore, his wife's native island, where he became the first known Japanese resident of Singapore. The British had compensated him generously for his contribution to the treaty with Japan, and had done well in business deals in Shanghai. He apparently rented a luxurious colonial house on Orchard Road, which is where he died at the age of 49, in 1867. Otokichi was buried at the Japanese Cemetery of Singapore. Half of his remains were returned to his hometown of Mihama in Japan on February 20, 2005. In popular culture The story of the Hojunmaru castaways was adapted as the feature film Kairei in 1983. Despite starring country singer Johnny Cash as John McLoughlin, and having a reported budget of US$4,000,000, the film was not a commercial success.

Forty-four percent of its graduating class of 2010 were National Merit Commended Scholars. (National Merit Commended Scholars generally score in the top 2% of all PSAT/NMSQT test-takers.) The focus of the school, however, is not on standardized test taking or college admission. Rather, the school seeks to introduce its students to the rich western tradition while giving a solid background in academics. Accreditation The Academy is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges and is a member of both the Secondary School Admission Test Board and the Association of Independent Schools of New England. History Boston University Academy was proposed and founded in 1993 by Peter Schweich, then the vice president of Boston University, and authorized by John Silber, then the president of Boston University. Peter Schweich was its first headmaster, and served in that role until 1999, when he was succeeded by interim head of school Dr. Jennifer Bond Hickman. Dr. James Tracy replaced Hickman and served until the spring of 2006, when he was replaced by Dr. James Berkman. On August 21, 2014, Berkman announced that he would retire after the 2014‚Äì2015 academic year. On November 14, 2014, Provost Jean Morrison announced the appointment of Dr. Ari Betof to replace Berkman effective July 1, 2015. In July 2018, Boston University announced the departure of Dr. Betof. Following his departure, Dr. Rosemary White succeeded him as interim head of school. Dr. White served as interim head of school until Christos J. Kolovos began his tenure in the summer of 2020. When Boston University Academy was founded, it covered grades 9-12; an 8th grade of approximately 20 students was added in 1999. The 8th grade was dropped in 2005.

It studies variations in language based primarily on geographic distribution and their associated features. Dialectology treats such topics as divergence of two local dialects from a common ancestor and synchronic variation. Dialectologists are ultimately concerned with grammatical, lexical and phonological features that correspond to regional areas. Thus they usually deal not only with populations that have lived in certain areas for generations, but also with migrant groups that bring their languages to new areas (see language contact). Commonly studied concepts in dialectology include the problem of mutual intelligibility in defining languages and dialects; situations of diglossia, where two dialects are used for different functions; dialect continua including a number of partially mutually intelligible dialects; and pluricentrism, where what is essentially a single genetic language exists as two or more standard varieties. Hans Kurath and William Labov are among the most prominent researchers in this field. HistoryDialects of English= In London, there were comments on the different dialects recorded in 12th-century sources, and a large number of dialect glossaries (focussing on vocabulary) were published in the 19th century.Petyt (1980), p.37 Philologists would also study dialects, as they preserved earlier forms of words. In Britain, the philologist Alexander John Ellis described the pronunciation of English dialects in an early phonetic system in volume 5 of his series On Early English Pronunciation. The English Dialect Society was later set up by Joseph Wright to record dialect words in the British Isles. This culminated in the production of the six-volume English Dialect Dictionary in 1905. The English Dialect Society was then disbanded, as its work was considered complete, although some regional branches (e.g. the Yorkshire Dialect Society) still operate today. Traditional studies in Dialectology were generally aimed at producing dialect maps, whereby imaginary lines were drawn over a map to indicate different dialect areas. The move away from traditional methods of language study, however, caused linguists to become more concerned with social factors. Dialectologists, therefore, began to study social, as well as regional variation. The Linguistic Atlas of the United States (the 1930s) was amongst the first dialect studies to take social factors into account. Under the leadership of Harold Orton, the University of Leeds became a centre for the study of English dialect and set up an Institute of Dialect and Folk Life Studies. In the 1950s, the university undertook the Survey of English Dialects, which covered all of England, some bordering areas of Wales and the Isle of Man. In addition, the University undertook more than 100 dialect monographs before the death of Harold Orton in 1975. The Institute closed in September 1983 to accommodate budget cuts for the University, but its dialectological studies are now part of a special collection, the Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture, in the University's Brotherton Library. This shift in interest consequently saw the birth of Sociolinguistics, which is a mixture of dialectology and social sciences. However, Graham Shorrocks has argued that there was always a sociological element to dialectology and that many of the conclusions of sociolinguists (e.g. the relationships with gender, class and age) can be found in earlier work by traditional dialectologists. In the US, most dialectological works was on a regional basis before the advent of sociolinguistics. Hans Kurath published a Handbook of the Linguistic Geography of New England in 1939. Similar works were later published for the Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic states, for the North Central States, for the Upper Mid-West, for the Rocky Mountain States, for the Pacific Coast and for the Gulf States.Petyt (1980), pp.43-44 =Dialects of French= Jules Gillieron published a linguistic atlas of 25 French-speaking locations in Switzerland in 1880. In 1888, Gillieron responded to a call from Gaston Paris for a survey of the dialects of French, likely to be superseded by Standard French in the near future, by proposing the Atlas Linguistique de la France. The principle fieldworker for the atlas, Edmond Edmont, surveyed 639 rural locations in French-speaking areas of France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. The questionnaire initially included 1400 items but this was later increased to over 1900. The atlas was published in 13 volumes between 1902 and 1910.Petyt (1980), pp.41-42 =Dialects of German= The first comparative dialect study in Germany was The Dialects of Bavaria in 1821 by Johann Andreas Schmeller, which included a linguistic atlas.Petyt, p.38 In 1873, a parson named L. Liebich surveyed the German-speaking areas of Alsace by a postal questionnaire that covered phonology and grammar. He never published any of his findings.Petyt (1980), p.39 In 1876, Eduard Sievers published Elements of Phonetics and a group of scholars formed the Neogrammarian school. This work in linguistics affected dialectology in German-speaking countries. In the same year, Jost Winteler published a monograph on the dialect of Kerenzen in the Canton of Glarus in Switzerland, which became a model for monographs on particular dialects.Petyt (1980), pp.39-40 Also in 1876, Georg Wenker, a young schoolteacher from D√ºsseldorf sent postal questionnaires out over Northern Germany. These postal questionnaires contained a list of sentences written in Standard German. These sentences were then transcribed into the local dialect, reflecting dialectal differences. He later expanded his work to cover the entire German Empire, including dialects in the east that have become extinct since the territory was lost to Germany. Wenker's work later became the Deutscher Sprachatlas at the University of Marburg. After Wenker's death in 1911, work continued under Ferdinand Wrede and later questionnaires covered Austria as well as Germany.Petyt (1980), pp.40-41 =Dialects of Italian and Corsican= The first treatment of Italian dialects is provided by Dante Alighieri in his treatise De vulgari eloquentia in the early fourteenth century. The founder of scientific dialectology in Italy was Graziadio Isaia Ascoli, who, in 1873, founded the journal Archivio glottologico italiano, still active today together with L'Italia dialettale, which was founded by Clemente Merlo in 1924. After completing his work in France, Edmond Edmont surveyed 44 locations in Corsica for the Atlas Linguistique de la Corse.Petyt (1980), p.41 Two students from the French atlas named Karl Jaberg and Jakob Jud surveyed Italian dialects in Italy and southern Switzerland in the Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der S√ºdschweiz.Petyt (1980), p.42 This survey influenced the work of Hans Kurath in the USA.Petyt (1980), p.44 =Dialects of Scots and Gaelic= The Linguistic Survey of Scotland began in 1949 at the University of Edinburgh.Petyt (1980), p.94 The first part of the survey researched dialects of Scots in the Scottish Lowlands, the Shetland Islands, the Orkney Islands, Northern Ireland, and the two northernmost counties of England: Cumberland (since merged into Cumbria) and Northumberland. Three volumes of results were published between 1975 and 1985.Petyt (1980), pp.95-96 The second part studied dialects of Gaelic, including mixed use of Gaelic and English, in the Scottish Highlands and Western Isles. Results were published under Cathair √ì Dochartaigh in five volumes between 1994 and 1997. Methods of data collection Dialect researchers typically use predominantly interview questionnaires to gather data on the dialect they are researching. These are not to be confused with what is called written questionnaires, which have had some applications in dialectology as well and which, recently, have had a comeback in linguistics more generally.Dollinger, Stefan. 2015. The Written Questionnaire in Social Dialectology. Amsterdam: Benjamins, chapter 1. There are two main types of questionnaires; direct and indirect. Researchers using for their face-to-face interviews the direct method will present the subject with a set of questions that demand a specific answer and are designed to gather either lexical or phonological information. For example, the linguist may ask the subject the name for various items, or ask him or her to repeat certain words. Indirect questionnaires are typically more open-ended and take longer to complete than direct questionnaires. A researcher using this method will sit down with a subject and begin a conversation on a specific topic. For example, he may question the subject about farm work, food and cooking, or some other subject, and gather lexical and phonological information from the information provided by the subject. The researcher may also begin a sentence, but allow the subject to finish it for him, or ask a question that does not demand a specific answer, such as \\"What are the most common plants and trees around here?\\"Chambers, J.K., and Trudgill, Peter. 1998. Dialectology. 2nd ed. Cambridge University Press. Cambridge.  Mutual intelligibility  Some have attempted to distinguish dialects from languages by saying that dialects of the same language are understandable to each other. The untenable nature of blunt application of this criterion is demonstrated by the case of Italian and Spanish cited below. While native speakers of the two may enjoy mutual understanding ranging from limited to considerable depending on the topic of discussion and speakers' experience with linguistic variety, few people would want to classify Italian and Spanish as dialects of the same language in any sense other than historical. Spanish and Italian are similar and to varying extents mutually comprehensible, but phonology, syntax, morphology, and lexicon are sufficiently distinct that the two cannot be considered dialects of the same language (but of the common ancestor Latin).  Diglossia  Another problem occurs in the case of diglossia, used to describe a situation in which, in a given society, there are two closely related languages, one of high prestige, which is generally used by the government and in formal texts, and one of low prestige, which is usually the spoken vernacular tongue. An example of this is Sanskrit, which was considered the proper way to speak in northern India but was accessible only by the upper class, and Prakrit which was the common (and informal or vernacular) speech at the time. Varying degrees of diglossia are still common in many societies around the world.  Dialect continuum  Major dialect continua in Europe in the mid-20th century A dialect continuum is a network of dialects in which geographically adjacent dialects are mutually comprehensible, but with comprehensibility steadily decreasing as distance between the dialects increases. An example is the Dutch-German dialect continuum, a vast network of dialects with two recognized literary standards. Although mutual intelligibility between standard Dutch and standard German is very limited, a chain of dialects connects them. Due to several centuries of influence by standard languages (especially in Northern Germany, where even today the original dialects struggle to survive) there are now many breaks in intelligibility between geographically adjacent dialects along the continuum, but in the past these breaks were virtually nonexistent. The Romance languages--Galician/Portuguese, Spanish, Sicilian, Catalan, Occitan/Proven√ßal, French, Sardinian, Romanian, Romansh, Friulan, other Italian, French, and Ibero-Romance dialects, and others--form another well- known continuum, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility. In both areas‚Äîthe Germanic linguistic continuum, the Romance linguistic continuum‚Äîthe relational notion of the term dialect is often vastly misunderstood, and today gives rise to considerable difficulties in implementation of European Union directives regarding support of minority languages. Perhaps this is no more evident than in Italy, where still today some of the population use their local language (dialetto 'dialect') as the primary means of communication at home and, to varying lesser extent, the workplace. Difficulties arise due to terminological confusion. The languages conventionally referred to as Italian dialects are Romance sister languages of Italian, not variants of Italian, which are commonly and properly called italiano regionale ('regional Italian'). The label Italian dialect as conventionally used is more geopolitical in aptness of meaning rather than linguistic: Bolognese and Neapolitan, for example, are termed Italian dialects, yet resemble each other less than do Italian and Spanish. Misunderstandings ensue if \\"Italian dialect\\" is taken to mean 'dialect of Italian' rather than 'minority language spoken on Italian soil', i.e. part of the network of the Romance linguistic continuum. The indigenous Romance language of Venice, for example, is cognate with Italian, but quite distinct from the national language in phonology, morphology, syntax, and lexicon, and in no way a derivative or a variety of the national language. Venetian can be said to be an Italian dialect both geographically and typologically, but it is not a dialect of Italian.  Pluricentrism  A pluricentric language is a single genetic language that has two or more standard forms. An example is Hindustani, which encompasses two standard varieties, Urdu and Hindi. Another example is Norwegian, with Bokm√•l having developed closely with Danish and Swedish, and Nynorsk as a partly reconstructed language based on old dialects. Both are recognized as official languages in Norway. In a sense, the set of dialects can be understood as being part of a single diasystem, an abstraction that each dialect is part of. In generative phonology, the differences can be acquired through rules. An example can be taken with Occitan (a cover term for a set of related varieties of Southern France) where 'cavaL' (from late Latin caballus, horse) is the diasystemic form for the following realizations * Languedocien dialect: caval (L > , sometimes velar, used concurrently with French borrowed forms chival or chivau); * Limousin dialect: chavau (ca > cha and -L > -u); * Proven√ßal dialect: cavau (-L > -u, used concurrently with French borrowed forms chival or chivau); * Gascon dialect: cavath (final -L > , sometimes palatalized, and used concurrently with French borrowed forms chibau) *Auvergnat and Vivaro- alpine dialects: chaval (same treatment of ca cluster as in Limousin dialect) This conceptual approach may be used in practical situations. For instance when such a diasystem is identified, it can be used construct a diaphonemic orthography that emphasizes the commonalities between the varieties. Such a goal may or may not fit with sociopolitical preferences.  The abstand and ausbau languages framework  One analytical paradigm developed by linguists is known as the abstand and ausbau languages framework. It has proved popular among linguists in Continental Europe, but is not so well known in English- speaking countries, especially among people who are not trained linguists. Although only one of many possible paradigms, it has the advantage of being constructed by trained linguists for the particular purpose of analyzing and categorizing varieties of speech, and has the additional merit of replacing such loaded words as \\"language\\" and \\"dialect\\" with the German terms of ausbau language and abstand language, words that are not (yet) loaded with political, cultural, or emotional connotations.

Their rhythm section is Steve Giles (bass) and Megan Jane (drums). The group was formed in 2001. Catania, explaining the origin of the band's name, said, \\"We were looking around for a name and I had this book by Tina Brown and I think the title was Life as a Party and there was a phrase in it that had something to do with being a saucy monkey and in reference to life in U.K..\\" Their debut album Celebrity Trash was released in 2003 and spawned two hit radio singles in Ireland -- \\"Flicker\\" and \\"Don't Wanna Know Your Name\\". In the summer of 2004 they released a remaking of the Divinyls song \\"I Touch Myself\\", which became another hit at Irish radio. The single was followed by their first full-length album, Turbulence, in September by 429 Records. In 2005, they signed a major distribution deal with the Savoy Label Group and re-released Turbulence in June 2005 across the United States. The first single to be released is \\"Disco Ball (Boulevard Remix)\\", a re-working of an older track from their first album. Disco Ball (Boulevard Remix) became a top 40 AAA radio hit.

It was devised by Michael Halliday, who took the notion of system from J. R. Firth, his teacher (Halliday, 1961). Firth proposed that systems refer to possibilities subordinated to structure; Halliday \\"liberated\\" choice from structure and made it the central organising dimension of SFL. In more technical terms, while many approaches to linguistic description place structure and the syntagmatic axis foremost, SFL adopts the paradigmatic axis as its point of departure. Systemic foregrounds Saussure's \\"paradigmatic axis\\" in understanding how language works.Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xi. For Halliday, a central theoretical principle is then that any act of communication involves choices. Language is above all a system; SFL maps the choices available in any language variety using its representation tool of a \\"system network\\". Functional signifies the proposition that language evolved under pressure of the functions that the language system must serve. Functions are taken to have left their mark on the structure and organisation of language at all levels, which is achieved via metafunctions. Metafunction is uniquely defined in SFL as the \\"organisation of the functional framework around systems\\", i.e., choices. This is a significant difference from other \\"functional\\" approaches, such as Dik's functional grammar (FG, or as now often termed, functional discourse grammar) and lexical functional grammar. To avoid confusion, the full designation‚Äîsystemic functional linguistics‚Äîis typically used, rather than functional grammar or functional linguistics. For Halliday, all languages involve three simultaneously generated metafunctions: one construes experience of our outer and inner reality as well as logical relations between phenomena (ideational); another enacts social relations (interpersonal relations); and a third weaves together these two functions to create text (textual‚Äîthe wording). Multidimensional semiotic system The point of departure for Halliday's work in linguistics has been the simple question: \\"how does language work?\\". Across his career he has probed the nature of language as a social semiotic system; that is, as a resource for meaning across the many and constantly changing contexts of human interaction. In 2003, he published a paper setting out the accumulated principles of his theory, which arose as he engaged with many different language-related problems. These principles, he wrote, \\"emerged as the by-product of those engagements as I struggled with particular problems\\",Halliday, M.A.K. 2003. Introduction: On the \\"architecture\\" of human language. In On Language and Linguistics. Volume 3 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. Edited by Jonathan Webster. London and New York: Continuum. as various as literary analysis and machine translation. Halliday has tried, then, to develop a linguistic theory and description that is appliable to any context of human language. His theory and descriptions are based on these principles, on the basis that they are required to explain the complexity of human language. There are five principles: * Paradigmatic dimension: Meaning is choice, i.e. users select from \\"options that arise in the environment of other options\\", and that \\"the power of language resides in its organisation as a huge network of interrelated choices\\" (see Linguistic system) * Stratification dimension. In the evolution of language from primary to higher- order semiotic, \\"a space was created in which meanings could be organized in their own terms, as a purely abstract network of interrelations\\". Between the content of form-pairing of simple semiotic systems emerged the \\"organizational space\\" referred to as lexicogrammar. This development put language on the road to becoming an apparently infinite meaning-making system. * Metafunctional dimension. Language displays \\"functional complementarity\\". In other words, it has evolved under the human need to make meanings about the world around and inside us, at the same time that it is the means for creating and maintaining our interpersonal relations. These motifs are two modes of meaning in discourse‚Äîwhat Halliday terms the \\"ideational\\" and the \\"interpersonal\\" metafunctions. They are organised via a third mode of meaning, the textual metafunction, which acts on the other two modes to create a coherent flow of discourse. * Syntagmatic dimension. Language unfolds syntagmatically, as structure laid down in time (spoken) or space (written). This structure involves units on different ranks within each stratum of the language system. Within the lexicogrammar, for example, the largest is the clause, and the smallest the morpheme; intermediate between these ranks are the ranks of group/phrase and of word. * Instantiation dimension. All of these resources are, in turn, \\"predicated on the vector of instantiation\\", defined as \\"the relation between an instance and the system that lies behind it\\". Instantiation is a formal relationship between potential and actual. Systemic functional theory assumes a very intimate relationship of continual feedback between instance and system: thus using the system may change that system. The notion of system in linguistics As the name suggests, the notion of system is a defining aspect of systemic functional linguistics. In linguistics, the term \\"system\\" can be traced back to Ferdinand de Saussure, who noticed the roughly corresponding paradigms between signifying forms and signified values. The paradigmatic principle of organization was established in semiotics by Saussure, whose concept of value (viz. \\"valeur\\") and of signs as terms in a system \\"showed up paradigmatic organization as the most abstract dimension of meaning\\". However, Halliday points out that system in the sense J.R. Firth and he himself used it was different from Saussure's.Halliday, M.A.K. 1985. Systemic Background. In \\"Systemic Perspectives on Discourse, Vol. 1: Selected Theoretical Papers\\" from the Ninth International Systemic Workshop, James D. Benson and William S. Greaves (eds). Ablex. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London: Continuum. p. 186. In their case, system does not stand for a list of signifying forms corresponding to a list of signified values. Instead, Firth and Halliday described systems as contrasting options in value realised by contrasting options in form where the options are not the entire form and the entire value but features thereof. In this sense, linguistic systems are a background for formal features, i.e. features of structure.Firth, J.R. 1968. Selected Papers of J.R. Firth 1952‚Äì1959. London: Longman. p183. Here, the most general linguistic system is human adult language itself since it is a system of options whereby humans choose whether to speak in English, in Chinese, in Spanish or in another variety of language. In this sense, language is a system (\\"the system of language\\") not only as proposed by Hjelmslev.Halliday, M.A.K. 2004. Introduction: How Big is a Language? On the Power of Language. In The Language of Science: Volume 5 in the Collected Works of M.A.K. Edited by J.J.Webster. London and New York: Continuum. p. xv., but also as a system of options. In this context, Jay Lemke describes human language as an open, dynamic system, which evolves together with the human species. In this use of system, grammatical or other features of language are best understood when described as sets of options. According to Halliday, \\"The most abstract categories of the grammatical description are the systems together with their options (systemic features). A systemic grammar differs from other functional grammars (and from all formal grammars) in that it is paradigmatic: a system is a paradigmatic set of alternative features, of which one must be chosen if the entry condition is satisfied.\\"Halliday, M.A.K. 1992. Systemic Grammar and the Concept of a ‚ÄúScience of Language‚Äù. In Waiguoyu (Journal of Foreign Languages), No. 2 (General Series No. 78), pp. 1‚Äì9. Reprinted in Full in Volume 3 in The Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London: Continuum. p. 209. System was a feature of Halliday's early theoretical work on language. He considered it one of four fundamental categories for the theory of grammar‚Äîthe others being unit, structure, and class.Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp. 241‚Äì92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. The category of system was invoked to account for \\"the occurrence of one rather than another from among a number of like events\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp. 241‚Äì92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p. 52 At that time, Halliday defined grammar as \\"that level of linguistic form at which operate closed systems\\".Halliday, M.A.K. 1961. Categories of the Theory of Grammar. Word. 17(3). pp. 241‚Äì92. Reprinted in Full in On Grammar: Volume 1 of the Collected Works of M.A.K. Halliday. London and New York: Continuum. p. 40 In adopting a system perspective on language, systemic functional linguistics have been part of a more general 20th- and 21st-century reaction against atomistic approaches to science, in which an essence is sought within smaller and smaller components of the phenomenon under study. In systems thinking, any delineated object of study is defined by its relations to other units postulated by the theory. In systemic functional linguistics, this has been described as the trinocular perspective. Thus a descriptive category must be defended from three perspectives: from above (\\"what does it construe?\\" \\"what effect does it have in a context of use?\\"), below (\\"how is this function realised?\\") and round about (\\"what else is in the neighbourhood?\\" \\"what other things does this thing have to interact with?\\"). This gives systemic functional linguistics an affinity with studies of complex systems. System network in systemic linguistics The label systemic is related to the system networks used in the description of human languages. System networks capture the dimension of choice at each stratum of the linguistic system to which they are applied. The system networks of the lexicogrammar make up systemic functional grammar. A system network is a theoretical tool to describe the sets of options available in a language variety; it represents abstract choice and does not correspond to a notion of actual choice or make psychological claims. Formally system networks correspond to type lattices in formal lattice theory, although they are occasionally erroneously mistaken for flowcharts or directed decision trees. Such directionality is always only a property of particular implementations of the general notion and may be made for performance reasons in, for example, computational modelling. System networks commonly employ multiple inheritance and \\"simultaneous\\" systems, or choices, which therefore combine to generate very large descriptive spaces.

The organisation is an executive non-departmental public body of the Department of Health and Social Care.  Role  NHS Digital provides digital services for the NHS and social care, including the management of large health informatics programmes. They deliver national systems through in-house teams, and by contracting private suppliers. These services include managing patient data including the Spine, which allows the secure sharing of information between different parts of the NHS, and forms the basis of the Electronic Prescription Service, Summary Care Record and Electronic Referral Service. NHS Digital is also the national collator of information about health and social care, and publishes over 260 statistical publications each year, including Official Statistics and National Statistics. It also runs \\"The NHS Website\\" (\`www.nhs.uk\`, formerly NHS Choices), which is the national website for the NHS in England. NHS Digital has taken on the roles of a number of predecessor bodies including the NHS Information Centre, NHS Connecting for Health, and parts of NHS Direct. The organisation produces more than 260 official and national statistical publications. This includes national comparative data for secondary uses, developed from the long-running Hospital Episode Statistics which can help local decision makers to improve the quality and efficiency of frontline care. History The organisation was created as a special health authority on 1 April 2005 by a merger of parts of the Department of Health, parts of the NHS Information Authority, and the Prescribing Support Unit. Following the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the HSCIC changed from a special health authority to an executive non-departmental public body on 1 April 2013. Effective at this time, HSCIC took over parts of the troubled NHS National Programme for IT from the agency NHS Connecting for Health (CfH) which ceased to exist. It also runs the Health Survey for England. On 20 April 2016, it was announced that HSCIC would be rebranding, changing its name to NHS Digital in July 2016. NHSX, created in February 2019, has oversight of digital strategy and policy in NHS England. As a budget-holder, NHSX commissions projects from NHS Digital. Business areasHandling patient data= NHS Digital runs the Spine service for the NHS, which is a central, secure system for patient data in England. This enables a number of services for patients, including: * the Electronic Prescription Service, which sends prescriptions digitally from GP surgeries and other NHS providers to pharmacies, without needing a printed prescription * the Summary Care Record which allows authorised NHS staff (such as hospital or ambulance staff) to see a summary of important information about a patient, to help give the best care. * the e-referral service which manages the booking of first time appointments with hospitals and specialists * the Child Protection - Information Sharing system, which helps ensure that any child protection concerns are known by the NHS when they are treated As the HSCIC, the organisation ran the care.data programme, which was cancelled in 2016. NHS Digital collects the national 'Hospital Episode Statistics' (HES), which is a record of every 'episode' of admitted patient care (counted by completing care with a consultant, meaning that more than one episode can be associated with a single stay in hospital) delivered by the NHS in England, including those done under contract by private providers. This involves the tracking of around 16 million 'episodes' of care every year. This information is used for a range of statistical analysis, as well as for determining payments to providers. In addition to admitted patient care, HES also provides data for outpatient and emergency care encounters. The Emergency Care Data Set has been created to replace HES A&E; data and provide better data on emergency care encounters. In November 2019 it launched the National Record Locator, which spans different health economies and is intended to enable paramedics, community mental health nurses, children‚Äôs health teams and maternity services to access the records of mental health patients across England. In August 2020 it launched a pilot electronic prescription service in three hospital trusts, where hospital prescriptions were sent electronically to the patient‚Äôs community pharmacy, as during the COVID-19 pandemic in England most outpatient consultations were held remotely. =Central technology team= A troubleshooting operation was established in 2018 to help NHS trusts when major IT deployments go wrong. Eight trusts needed emergency assistance in 2018 after a deployment led to severe service disruptions. Funding of ¬£2 million a year for the service has been allocated and expansion is expected. =Statistics and data= NHS Digital compiles national data about the NHS and social care, with over 260 publications every year.

It is ubiquitous in West Virginia, particularly in convenience stores, and is arguably the food most closely associated with the state. The classic pepperoni roll consists of a fairly soft white yeast bread roll with pepperoni baked in the middle. During baking, the fats in the pepperoni (which are hard at room temperature) melt, resulting in a spicy oil suffusing into the bread. Pepperoni rolls are typically eaten as a snack or as the main dish of a lunch either unheated or slightly warmed. Origins A packaged pepperoni roll The pepperoni roll was first sold by Giuseppe \\"Joseph\\" Argiro at the Country Club Bakery in Fairmont, West Virginia, in 1927. The rolls originated as a lunch option for the coal miners of north-central West Virginia in the first half of the 20th century. Pepperoni rolls do not need to be refrigerated for storage and could readily be packed for lunch by miners. Pepperoni and other Italian foods became popular in north-central West Virginia in the early 20th century, when the booming mines and railroads attracted many immigrants from Italy. The pepperoni roll bears a resemblance to the pasty and sausage roll, which originated in the mining communities of Great Britain, as well as the Italian calzone. Variations Variations on the original pepperoni roll may contain different types of cheese, peppers, etc. The pepperoni within can take several forms, including a single stick, several folded slices, or shredded or ground meat. Legal challenges Pepperoni rolls faced a legal challenge in 1987 when the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) proposed reclassifying bakeries that manufactured the rolls as meat processing plants, thus subjecting them to stricter regulations. The bakery owners said, however, that the costs of meeting the new regulations would put them out of business. The USDA's proposal was quashed after Jay Rockefeller, U.S. Senator for West Virginia, intervened. As military rations In the early 2000s, the U.S. military began including a version of the pepperoni roll in one of the MREs (Meals, Ready-to-Eat) provided to troops. In the late 2000s, the U.S. Army changed the pepperoni roll to its First Strike Ration. These rations are designed for light infantry, airborne, and special forces during a typical 72-hour patrol. The pepperoni roll's compact size and comparatively high nutritional return make it an ideal ration for these patrols. These rations were extensively employed during Operation Enduring Freedom. The military's rolls are made by a North Carolina company.

A Sea Symphony is a composition for orchestra and chorus by Ralph Vaughan Williams, written between 1903 and 1909. Vaughan Williams's first and longest symphony, it was first performed at the Leeds Festival in 1910, with the composer conducting. The symphony's maturity belies the composer's relative youth when it was written (he was 30 when he first began sketching it). One of the first symphonies in which a choir is used throughout the work and is an integral part of the musical texture, A Sea Symphony helped set the stage for a new era of symphonic and choral music in Britain during the first half of the 20th century. The work is sometimes referred to as the Symphony No. 1. History From 1903 to 1909, Ralph Vaughan Williams worked intermittently on a series of songs for chorus and orchestra that were to become his most lengthy project to date and his first true symphony. Originally titled The Ocean, A Sea Symphony was first performed in 1910 at the Leeds Festival on the composer's 38th birthday. This is generally cited as his first large-scale work; although Grove lists some 16 other orchestral works composed by Vaughan Williams before he completed A Sea Symphony, including two with chorus, the vast majority of those are juvenilia or apprentice works that have never been published and are long since withdrawn from circulation. Nevertheless, Vaughan Williams had never before attempted a work of quite this duration, or for such large forces, and it was his first of what would eventually be nine symphonies. Like Brahms, Vaughan Williams delayed a long time before composing his first symphony, but remained prolific throughout the end of his life: his final symphony was composed from 1956‚Äì58, and completed when he was 85 years of age. Structure At approximately 70 minutes, A Sea Symphony is the longest of all Vaughan Williams's symphonies. Although it represents a departure from the traditional Germanic symphonic tradition of the time, it follows a fairly standard symphonic outline: fast introductory movement, slow movement, scherzo, and finale. The four movements are: * A Song for All Seas, All Ships (baritone, soprano, and chorus) * On the Beach at Night, Alone (baritone and chorus) * Scherzo: The Waves (chorus) * The Explorers (baritone, soprano, semi-chorus, and chorus) The first movement lasts roughly twenty minutes; the inner movements approximately eleven and eight minutes, and the finale lasts roughly thirty minutes. Text The text of A Sea Symphony comes from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. Though Whitman's poems were little known in England at the time, Vaughan Williams was attracted to them for their ability to transcend both metaphysical and humanist perspectives. Whitman's use of free verse was also beginning to make waves in the compositional world, where fluidity of structure was beginning to be more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. Vaughan Williams sets sections from the following poems in A Sea Symphony: *Movement 1: ‚ÄúSong of the Exposition‚Äù and ‚ÄúSong for all Seas, all Ships\\" *Movement 2: \\"On the Beach at Night Alone\\" *Movement 3: \\"After the Sea-ship\\", taken in its entirety *Movement 4: \\"Passage to India\\" MusicOrchestration= The symphony is scored for soprano, baritone, chorus and a large orchestra consisting of: *Woodwinds: two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, E-flat clarinet, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon *Brass: four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba *Percussion: timpani (F2‚ÄìF3), side drum, bass drum, triangle, suspended cymbal, crash cymbals *Organ *Strings: two harps, and strings. To facilitate more performances of the work, the full score also includes the provision that it may be performed by a reduced orchestra of two flutes (second doubling piccolo), one oboe, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, one harp, and strings. The chorus sings in all four movements. Both soloists are featured in the first and last movements, while only the baritone sings in the second movement. The scherzo is for the chorus and orchestra alone. =Influences= Comparisons to Stanford, Parry, and Elgar, as in the Grove article, are expected. Not only were the four writing during the same era and in the same country, Vaughan Williams studied with both Stanford and Parry at the Royal College of Music (RCM), and his preparations for composing A Sea Symphony included study of both Elgar's Enigma Variations (1898‚Äì99) and his oratorio The Dream of Gerontius (1900). A Sea Symphony is among the best-known of a host of sea-related pieces being written around the same time in England, some of the most famous of which are Stanford's Songs of the Sea (1904) and Songs of the Fleet (1910), Elgar's Sea Pictures (1899), and Frank Bridge's The Sea (1911). Debussy's La mer (1905) may also have been influential in this apparent nautical obsession. Vaughan Williams studied with Ravel for three months in Paris in the winter of 1907‚Äì1908. Though he worked chiefly on orchestration, this was to provide quite a contrast to the Germanic tradition handed down through Stanford and Parry at the RCM, and perhaps began to give Vaughan Williams a greater sense for colour and a freedom to move chords as block units. His partiality towards mediant relationships, a unifying harmonic motive of A Sea Symphony, may have been somewhat liberated by these studies, and this harmonic relationship is now considered symptomatic of his style in general. A Sea Symphony also makes use of both pentatonic and whole tone scales, now often considered idiomatic features of French music of the period. Almost certainly, this music was in Vaughan Williams's mind as he finished work on A Sea Symphony in 1908‚Äì1909, but Ravel paid him the great compliment of calling him ‚Äúthe only one of my students who does not write my music.‚Äù =Motives= Musically, A Sea Symphony contains two strong unifying motives. The first is the harmonic motive of two chords (usually one major and one minor) whose roots are a third apart. This is the first thing that occurs in the symphony; the brass fanfare is a B flat minor chord, followed by the choir singing the same chord, singing Behold, the sea. The full orchestra then comes in on the word sea, which has resolved into D major. { ew ChoralStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo \\"Moderato maestoso\\" 4 = 59 \\\\partial 16*1 16  2~ 4\\\\. 8  2 } \\\\addlyrics { Be- hold, the sea } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key d \\\\major 16\\\\ff  2~ 4\\\\. 8  2 } >> } The second motive is a melodic figure juxtaposing duplets and triplets, set at the opening of the symphony (and throughout the first movement) to the words And, on its limitless heaving breast... In the common method of counting musical rhythms, the pattern could be spoken as 'one two-and three-two-three four', showing that the second beat is divided into eighth notes (for on its) and the third beat is divided into triplets (for limitless). \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble umericTimeSignature \\\\time 4/4 \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\tempo 4 = 59 \\\\partial 2*1 \\\\autoBeamOff a4 b8 d  \\\\times 2/3 { cis b a } b8. a16 a4. } \\\\addlyrics { And on its lim- it- less, heav- ing breast } Reception and legacy The impact of A Sea Symphony manifests itself not only in the life of the composer (his first symphony and first work of such an immense scale), but also in the newfound support and appreciation of the English symphony and 20th century English music in general. Hugh Ottaway's book, Vaughan Williams Symphonies presents the following observation in its introduction: :‚ÄúThe English symphony is almost entirely a twentieth-century creation. When in 1903 Vaughan Williams began to sketch the songs for chorus and orchestra that became A Sea Symphony, Elgar had not yet emerged as a symphonist. And, extraordinary though it may seem, Elgar's First (1908) is the earliest symphony by an English composer in the permanent repertory. . . By the time Vaughan Williams had completed his Ninth [Symphony] ‚Äì in 1958, a few months before his death at the age of 85 ‚Äì the English symphony . . . had become a central figure of our musical revival. To say that Vaughan Williams played a major part in bringing this about is to state the obvious: throughout much of the period he was actively involved in English musical life, not only as a composer but as a teacher, conductor, organiser and, increasingly, advisor of young men.‚Äù (5) In the Grove article on Vaughan Williams, Ottaway and Frogley call the work: :‚Äú‚Ä¶a triumph of instinct over environment. The tone is optimistic, Whitman's emphasis on the unity of being and the brotherhood of man comes through strongly, and the vitality of the best things in it has proved enduring. Whatever the indebtedness to Parry and Stanford, and in the finale to Elgar, there is no mistaking the physical exhilaration or the visionary rapture.‚Äù Ursula Vaughan Williams, in what has become the definitive biography of her husband Ralph Vaughan Williams, writes of his philosophy in a more general sense: :‚Äú‚Ä¶he was aware of the common aspirations of generations of ordinary men and women with whom he felt a deep, contemplative sympathy. And so there is in his work a fundamental tension between traditional concepts of belief and morality and a modern spiritual anguish which is also visionary.‚Äù References *Day, James.

The same court ruled on whether parishes were or were not crofting parishes. In many respects the Act was modelled on the Irish Land Acts of 1870 and 1881. By granting the crofters security of tenure, the Act put an end to the Highland Clearances. The Act was largely a result of crofters' agitation which had become well organised and very persistent in Skye and of growing support, throughout the Highlands, for the Crofters Party, which had gained five members of parliament in the general election of 1885. Agitation took the form of rent strikes (withholding rent payments) and occupying land which the landlords had reserved for hunting or sheep. The Act itself did not quell the agitation. In particular it was very weak in terms of enabling the Crofters Commission to resolve disputes about access to land. It was enough however to make much more acceptable, politically, the use of troops in confrontations with agitators. The Act was not fully effective in increasing the equality of land distribution in Scotland. By the year 2000, two-thirds of Scotland's land area was still owned by only 1,252 landowners out of a population of 5 million. (figures are for 2000) Background During the Highland Clearances, the crofters had no official rights to the land; until 1886, it was legal to evict any crofter at the landlord's convenience. The Land Wars commenced in Scotland in 1874 with the successful legal case of the Bernera Riot on the island of Great Bernera in the Outer Hebrides. The crofters wanted recognition of their traditional rights to the land that they had enjoyed under the clan system from the Middle Ages. Through political and economic development the gentry began to take an alternate perspective on their tenantry: > The cultural force of ' [heritage] was pervasive in Gaeldom and was central > to the social cohesion of the clan because it articulated the expectations > of the masses that the ruling family had the responsibility to act as their > protectors and guarantee secure possession of land in return for allegiance, > military service, tribute and rental. It was a powerful and enduring belief > which lived on long after the military rationale of clanship itself had > disappeared and tribal chiefs had shed their ancient responsibilities and > become commercial landlords. Land agitation in Scotland began because of the \\"Home Rule\\" movement in Ireland and information and opinions of this movement brought by fishermen to the Outer Hebrides. Believing that they were the rightful owners of the land, crofters used rent strikes and what came to be known as land raids: crofter occupations of land to which crofters believed they should have access for common grazing or for new crofts, but which landlords had given over to sheep farming and hunting parks (called deer forests). The strife grew more intense; the landlords hired warships for protection from the crofters. From time to time there were open uprisings and riots. In 1884 suffrage was extended to men owning land worth at least ¬£10 or paying ¬£10 in rent annually. This included many Highland crofters. At a political level the crofters wanted legal rights, so the ' ('Highland Land Law Reform Association') was established in 1885 in London. The Crofters' Party was established and elected five MPs in 1885. ' ('The people are stronger than the lord') was their best-known slogan. The government feared that the \\"Home Rule\\" movement would spread to the (Gaelic- speaking areas in Scotland) from Ireland. The Napier Commission interviewed crofters all over the and made careful study of the crofters' position, publishing its report in 1884. William Gladstone tried to pass a new law granting crofters more rights, but it was voted down in May 1885. Gladstone left his post in 1885 but the other parties created a new government. Gladstone returned to power in January 1886, and the act was finally passed 25 June 1886. The Act For the first time in Scottish history, the Crofting Act of 1886 affirmed the rights of crofters to their land. It also granted a legal status to crofting towns. The Act dealt with the following points especially: * It gave security of tenure to the crofters, as long as they worked the croft and paid the rent. * Crofters had the right to pass down their croft to their descendants. * Crofters had the right to be paid for land improvements, such as erecting fences and drainage * A standard of reasonable rent was established and required. * The first Crofters' Commission was established. * Crofters had the opportunity to reassess the rent with the Crofters' Commission. The Act specified eight counties of Scotland as counties where parishes might be recognised as crofting parishes: Argyll, Caithness, Cromarty, Inverness, Orkney, Ross, Shetland, and Sutherland. Within these counties a crofting parish was a parish where there were year-by-year tenants of land (tenants without leases) who were paying less than ¬£30 a year in rent and who had possessed effective common grazing rights during the 80 years since 24 June 1806. The Crofters' Commission also was in charge of establishing fair rent and reevaluating rents every seven years. If crofters believed that the rent was too high they had the opportunity to go to the commission. Quite often the rents were lowered or even removed, if the crofters had already been paying too much. The Commission had the power to reform the Act and establish other Acts, as well as grant green land to crofters in order to enlarge small crofts. Results There were different opinions about the Act. On the one hand crofters complained that the Act did not go far enough, because they were not granted automatic right to fertile land for expansion of their small crofts. Worse, the Act did not delineate the position of cotters, who had never had land. After a while, they saw that the Commission was willing to protect their rights, especially with regard to rent security. Unfortunately, the Commission was underfunded and there was not enough land to distribute to crofters. The Act did not resolve the greatest complaint of the crofters, that the land should be returned to them. There was no resolution of the issue where landlords and crofters wanted the same piece of land. On the other hand, the landlords said that there was \\"communism looming in the future\\" and The Scotsman wrote that the Act was a \\"great infringement on the rights of private property.'\\" The Act did not end the land agitation, because Arthur Balfour believed that the Act gave moral authority to the authorities to quell every uprising to reestablish \\"law and order.\\" For this reason, warships were sent to the Isle of Skye and Tiree. In the years after the Act, ' (now called ', \\"the Land League\\") and the Crofters' Party the political influence that they had had, because they could not agree on the issue of land and how far to follow the \\"Home Rule\\" movement in Ireland on the issue of land ownership. This opinion was raised again in the Crofting Act 1976 in which crofters gained the legal right to purchase their land for fifteen years' rent. However, by owning their own land, crofters lost the right to CCAGS (Crofting Counties Agricultural Grant Scheme). In the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 the right of purchase was given to community organizations even against the will of landowners, to advance social and economic development. The Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 granted equality between tenants and landowners, especially with regard to grants and obligations and clarified the details of residency requirements. Now, tenants or owners must live within of the croft. Crofts not in use may be granted to new tenants. Looking back in history, Hunter believes that the Act established an old-fashioned order, with a place for the tenantry quite different than as in Ireland where crofters could buy their land under \\"Home Rule\\" acts. The Act was neither effective in the development of crofting communities nor did it encompass the political and social beliefs of those communities. But according to Wightman, the Act paved the road to further land development in Scotland, although it did not affect areas outside the . Wightman also stated that the \\"land question\\" has yet to be resolved, as two-thirds of Scotland's land area is still owned by only 1,252 landowners out of a population of 5 million.  Primary Legislation since 1886  There has been a steady flow of primary legislation on crofting, including: * Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886 * Crofters Holding (Scotland) Act 1887 * Crofters Commission (Delegation of Powers) Act 1888 * Crofters Common Grazings Regulation Act, 1891 * Small Landholders (Scotland) Act 1911 * Crofters (Scotland) Act 1955 * Crofters (Scotland) Act 1961 * Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 1976 * Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 * Transfer of Crofting Estates (Scotland) Act 1997 * Crofting Reform etc. Act 2007 * Crofting Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 * Crofting (Amendment) (Scotland) Act 2013 This is summarised in David Findlay's Blog for the Law Society of Scotland.https://www.lawscot.org.uk/news-and-events/blogs- opinions/platinum-blog-david-findlay/ See also * Highland Clearances * Highland Potato Famine * History of Scotland ¬ß Rural life Citations References   * * External links * Category:Crofting Category:Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom concerning Scotland Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1886 Category:History of Orkney Category:History of Shetland Category:History of the Outer Hebrides Category:History of the Scottish Highlands Category:History of Argyll and Bute Category:1886 in Scotland Category:Highland Estates Category:Highlands and Islands of Scotland Category:Agriculture legislation in the United Kingdom Category:Land law ","title":"Crofters Holdings (Scotland) Act 1886"},{"id":"2019285","text":"Chicken is a widely consumed white meat. In culinary terms, white meat is meat which is pale in color before and after cooking. A common example of white meat is the lighter-colored meat of poultry (light meat), coming from the breast, as contrasted with dark meat from the legs. Poultry white (\\"light\\") meat is made up of fast-twitch muscle fibres, while red (\\"dark\\") meat is made up of muscles with fibres that are slow-twitch. In traditional gastronomy, white meat also includes rabbit, the flesh of milk-fed young mammals (in particular veal and lamb), and pork.Larousse Gastronomique, 1961, s.v. porkEvan Goldstein, Joyce Goldstein, Perfect Pairings: A Master Sommelier‚Äôs Practical Advice for Partnering Wine with Food, , 2006, p. 109: \\"White meats such as pork and veal are also excellent table companions for Gew√ºrz...\\"Pierre Paillon, Secrets of Good French Cooking, , 1996, p. 95: \\"White meats (veal and pork) and poultry should be cooked \\"medium\\"...\\"Elisabeth Rozin, The Primal Cheeseburger: A Generous Helping of Food History Served On a Bun, 1994, p. 19: \\"Beef and lamb are clearly red meats, while veal and rabbit are white meats; the white meat category has been generalized to include the flesh of poultry and fish as well.\\" In nutritional studies however, white meat includes poultry and fish, but excludes all mammal flesh, which is considered red meat. The United States Department of Agriculture classifies meats as red if the myoglobin level is higher than 65%. This categorization is controversial as some types of fish, such as tuna, are red when raw and turn white when cooked; similarly, certain types of poultry that are sometimes grouped as white meat are actually red when raw, such as duck and goose.  Poultry  Within poultry, there are two types of meats‚Äîwhite and dark. The different colours are based on the different locations and uses of the muscles. White meat can be found within the breast of a chicken or turkey. Dark muscles are fit to develop endurance or long-term use, and contain more myoglobin than white muscles, allowing the muscle to use oxygen more efficiently for aerobic respiration. White meat contains large amounts of protein. Dark meat contains 2.64 times more saturated fat than white meat, per gram of protein. One commentator wrote that dark meat contains more vitamins, while a New York Times columnist has stated the two meats are nearly identical in nutritional value, especially when compared with typical red meat. For ground-based birds like chicken and turkeys, dark meats occur in the legs, which are used to support the weight of the animals while they move. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, of boneless, skinless turkey breast contains about one gram of fat, compared with roughly two grams of fat for of boneless, skinless thigh.Anahead O'Connor, \\"Really? The Claim: White Meat Is Healthier Than Dark Meat\\" in the New York Times, 20 Nov 2007. The numbers go up when the skin is kept in: a chicken thigh, with skin intact, has 13 grams of total fat and 3.5 grams of saturated fat per serving; this is about 20 percent of the recommended maximum daily intake. Birds which use their chest muscles for sustained flight (such as geese and ducks) have dark meat throughout their bodies.Article on the color of turkey and chicken meat  Pork  Because of nutritional concerns, it can be preferable for meat producers to have their products considered white meat. The United States National Pork Board has marketed their product as \\"Pork. The Other White Meat\\". In Israel, where Jewish dietary laws which forbid the consumption of pork are popularly practiced, \\"white meat\\" is the accepted euphemism for pork. Health effects The health effects that correlate with white meat consumption have been studied as compared to red meat and vegetarian diets. There is a decreased incidence of stroke. There is no association with obesity or insulin resistance. White meat appears to have a neutral or favorable effect on blood coagulation profiles. There is additional evidence that myoglobin promotes carcinogenesis in colorectal models and therefore epidemiologic evidence supports reduced prevalence of colon cancer in those who consume white meat as opposed to red meat.

Higgins' headstone in Quantico National Cemetery On February 17, 1988, Higgins disappeared while serving as the Chief, Observer Group Lebanon and Senior Military Observer, United Nations Military Observer Group, United Nations Truce Supervision Organization. He was driving alone on the coastal highway between Tyre and Naqoura in southern Lebanon, returning from a meeting with a local leader of the Amal movement, when he was pulled from his vehicle by armed men suspected of being affiliated with Hezbollah. During his captivity, he was interrogated and tortured. As a reaction to his abduction, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 618, demanding his release. A year and a half after his abduction, images of his body, hanged by the neck, were televised around the world from a videotape released by his captors. The exact date of Higgins' murder is uncertain; he was declared dead on July 6, 1990. His remains were recovered on December 23, 1991, by Major Jens Nielsen of the Royal Danish Army, who was attached to the United Nations Observation Group in Beirut. His remains were found beside a mosque near a south Beirut hospital.Giandomenico Picco, Man Without a Gun, Times Books, New York (1999) He was interred at Quantico National Cemetery, Triangle, Virginia, on December 30, 1991. On February 16, 1992, Israeli troops assassinated Hezbollah leader Abbas al- Musawi, avenging Higgins' death.

Higgins, USMC,\\" dated January 16, 2003. DoD General Counsel Judith A. Miller initially blocked the award in 1998 based on the claim that \\"circumstances do not appear to meet the criteria established by Congress for award of the Prisoner of War Medal.\\" The Navy later overruled her after it was determined that the 1989 expansion of the eligibility criteria allowed the award.

Early career Jo was born on October 21, 1925 in Brooklyn, New York. At the age of 12 he saw Billie Holiday singing in a club and fell in love with music. He became an apprentice music journalist, meeting up with Gloria Swanson and Mel Brooks. Having gone solo, he handled publicity for Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck and others. After touring Europe with Nat ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Cole in 1960, he decided to relocate to London.  Anglo-American folk music  In 1962 American folk singer Julie Felix decided to hitch-hike around Europe. In 1964 she finally arrived in Britain. Jo Lustig saw her potential and offered to become her agent. At this time Decca was emphatically uncool. When they signed Julie Felix it was the first time a British label acquired a major folk artist. Lustig promoted her to record an album and a single (‚ÄúSomeday soon‚Äù) and an appearance on the Eamonn Andrews TV show. She was the first British-based folk singer to fill the Albert Hall. In 1965 when Nico met Lustig at a party hosted by the co-producer of the Bond films, she said ‚ÄúI want to be a singer‚Äù. A few weeks later she was on ‚ÄúReady Steady Go‚Äù, singing her first single, thanks to Jo. However, she was not successful, and in 1966 joined Andy Warhol at The Factory.  British folk music  In 1968 Lustig spotted ‚ÄúThe Pentangle‚Äù. In 1969 he gave them one of the first mystery album sleeves ‚Äì a silhouette of the band (see The Pentangle). The cover of their second album Sweet Child was designed by Peter Blake, creator of The Beatles \\"Sgt. Pepper cover. Lustig also brought Pentangle a U.S. concert tour beginning in February 1969 at the Fillmore East. In 1970 Ralph McTell changed his manager Bruce May for Jo Lustig. In October he was able to fill the Royal Festival Hall. In 1972 Robin and Barry Dransfield's ‚ÄúLord of all I Behold‚Äù was Melody Maker's Folk Album of the Year. Jo eagerly read the pop press and signed them up, even before the album was released. The two brothers were then signed to Warner Brothers in America, and were off on a big concert tour supporting another Lustig act, Ralph McTell. Unfortunately the brothers not only quarrelled with each other but Barry seemed to be psychologically unable to handle large-scale commercial fame. Jo tore up the contract in disgust. This gives a hint of how impatient and short- tempered Jo Lustig was. By the end of the 1972 McTell had also broken with Jo Lustig. Ralph's brother Bruce was in charge again. It is perhaps surprising that Jo never managed Donovan, the biggest of all British folk artists. The reason is that Mickie Most got there first, and managed Donovan well. Another casualty of Jo's aggressive publicity-seeking approach was Anne Briggs, who was so disgusted that she gave up singing altogether, citing Jo as one of the reasons. Shel Talmy described him as ‚Äúone of my most unfavourite people‚Äù.  Steeleye Span  After the departure of Martin Carthy and Ashley Hutchings, Steeleye Span were eager for commercial success. They sacked Sandy Roberton and signed up with Jo Lustig. He brought them a lucrative contract with Chrysalis, and lavish studio time. Within a year they had a hit, ‚ÄúGaudete‚Äù. Somewhere along the line, Jo Lustig managed Irish harpist Mary O'Hara, who emerged after a decade in a convent to become a popular easy listening act. He also managed folk singer Richard Digance and, for a while, Jethro Tull (during the \\"Songs from the Wood\\" period). In 1974, the Chieftains were still semi- professional, despite having released ‚ÄúChieftains 4‚Äù in 1974, to worldwide praise. In 1975 they became full-time musicians and took Jo Lustig as their manager. He brought them a contract with a major label, Island Records. By 1982 Richard and Linda Thompson were also managed by Jo, but it is not clear when this started. About 1980 Jo Lustig created his own record label called Luggage, but only one act is known to have appeared in it ‚Äì the Home Service. Jo financed the first Home Service single in 1981. Despite containing talented musicians, the Home Service were not commercially successful. Perhaps this was the reason that he gave up folk bands, and became a film producer.  Lustig in films  In 1985 Jo produced The Doctor and the Devils a historical thriller. In 1987 there came his best-known venture, 84 Charing Cross Road, in which he was associate producer. In 1989 he started to specialise in television documentaries about musicians, starting with The Unforgettable Nat 'King'. Blondes: Anita Ekberg was also in 1999. Diana Dors was on television in 1999. Maria Callas : life and art (1999) was produced by Jo for video release. He died of cancer on May 29, 1999 in Cambridge, England.

Unlike Vaughan Williams's first three symphonies, it was not given a title, the composer stating that it was to be understood as pure music, without any incidental or external inspiration. In contrast to many of Vaughan Williams's previous compositions, the symphony displays a severity of tone. The composer himself once observed of it, \\"I'm not at all sure that I like it myself now. All I know is that it's what I wanted to do at the time.\\" According to the letter written by Arthur Benjamin to Vaughan Williams on 21 April 1935 (BL MS Mus 1714/1/9, ff. 113‚Äì14), the British composer Sir William Walton admired the work greatly. Benjamin wrote: \\"I met Willy Walton on the way to the Hall and he said ‚Äî having been to the rehearsals ‚Äî that we were going to hear the greatest symphony since Beethoven. Arnold, too, agreed. An alternative source states that Walton heard Constant Lambert saying it to Benjamin. Only two symphonies of Vaughan Williams end loudly: No. 4 and No. 8. The work was first performed on 10 April 1935 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Adrian Boult. Its first recording, made two years later, featured the composer himself conducting the same orchestra in what proved to be his only commercial recording of any of his symphonies. It was released on 78-rpm discs in the U.K. by HMV and in the U.S. by RCA Victor, and has been reissued on LP and CD.Vaughan Williams conducts Vaughan Williams [from Amazon website]. Retrieved 2011-07-10. The United States premiere was given on 19 December 1935 by Artur Rodzi≈Ñski and the Cleveland Orchestra. The earliest American performance to have survived in recorded form was the broadcast of 14 March 1943 by the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski. It was the only time he ever conducted the work and his performance has been issued on CD by Cala Records.

Peggy Glanville-Hicks‚Äô claim His student, the Australian composer Peggy Glanville-Hicks, claimed that he had borrowed the opening theme of the first movement from her Sinfonietta for Small Orchestra in D minor (1935), and that she in turn borrowed it back for her opera The Transposed Heads (1953). Glanville-Hicks did not complete her Sinfonietta until three months after the premiere of Vaughan Williams's symphony, but she was writing it at the same time as the composition of the symphony.Victoria Rogers, The Music of Peggy Glanville-Hicks, p. 30.

Biography Vojo Staniƒá was born in Podgorica, and grew up in Nik≈°iƒá. He completed Academy of Sculpture in Belgrade, after which he moved to Herceg Novi. During that time he turned to painting, enabling him to better express his peace-loving, Mediterranean spirit and interest in people. His paintings are small drama stories from everyday life, full of spirit. They bring back to life the spirit of Renaissance comedies, presenting human weaknesses and at the same time he shows understanding for them. Topics from cafes, sea or home are often a mixture of surreal details or imaginative relationship of characters and objects. He is one of the most important modern Montenegrin painters, and is a member of CANU and DANU. He had several individual exhibits. The most important exhibit of his was at Venice Biennale in 1997. His paintings are exhibited in a number of galleries in Montenegro, as well as in the permanent exhibit in the Art Museum in Cetinje.

A herbivore from South Africa, it had a large body and sturdy limbs, suggesting it moved about on all fours. Its limb bones were massive and weighty, like sauropod limb bones.  Description  Size comparison Melanorosaurus had a skull which measured approximately 250 mm. The snout was somewhat pointed, and the skull was somewhat triangular when seen from above or below. The premaxilla had four teeth on each side, a characteristic of primitive sauropodomorphs. The maxilla had 19 teeth on each side of the jaw.

They were collected from the Triassic Lower Elliot Formation, dating to the early Norian, on the north slope of the Thaba 'Nyama (Black Mountain) in Transkei, South Africa.S.H. Haughton, 1924, \\"The fauna and stratigraphy of the Stormberg Series\\", Annals of the South African Museum 12 : 323-497 The first complete skull referred to Melanorosaurus, NM QR3314, was described in 2007.Yates, Adam M., \\"The first complete skull of the Triassic dinosaur Melanorosaurus Haughton (Sauropodomorpha: Anchisauria)\\". In Barrett & Batten (eds.), Evolution and Palaeobiology (2007), pp. 9‚Äì55. However, this specimen comes from the Upper Elliot, unlike the Melanorosaurus type material and NM QR1551, rendering its referral to the genus untenable.McPhee, B.W., Bordy, E.M., Sciscio, L., and Choiniere, J.N. 2017. The sauropodomorph biostratigraphy of the Elliot Formation of southern Africa: Tracking the evolution of Sauropodomorpha across the Triassic‚ÄìJurassic boundary. Acta Palaeontologica Polonica 62 (3): 441‚Äì465. Melanorosaurus thabanensis was named in 1993 by Gauffre, based on holotype MNHN LES-16, a femur found in the Upper Triassic lower Elliot Formation. However, a recent review of the material demonstrated that the femur, along with six other bones, can't be referred to the genus Melanorosaurus, and a new combination (Meroktenos thabanensis) was created.  Classification  Life restoration Melanorosaurus was once classified as a prosauropod, but Prosauropoda no longer appears to be a natural group. According to some definitions of Sauropoda, Melanorosaurus is an early sauropod. However, these definitions also take in many other former \\"prosauropods\\", and Adam Yates has proposed a definition of Sauropoda that will specifically exclude Melanorosaurus (Sauropoda as all sauropodomorphs closer to Saltasaurus than Melanorosaurus). This definition would allow Sauropoda to retain its traditional concept.

The screenplay is by Budd Schulberg and is based on his short story \\"Your Arkansas Traveler\\", from the collection Some Faces in the Crowd (1953). The story centers on Larry \\"Lonesome\\" Rhodes, a drifter who is discovered by the producer (Neal) of a small-market radio program in rural northeast Arkansas. Rhodes ultimately rises to great fame and influence on national television. The character was inspired by Schulberg's acquaintance with Will Rogers Jr. The successes of Arthur Godfrey and Tennessee Ernie Ford were also acknowledged in the screenplay. The film launched Griffith into stardom but got mixed reviews upon its original release. Later decades have seen favorable reappraisals of the movie, and in 2008 it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot In late 1950s America, radio journalist Marcia Jeffries encounters a drunken drifter, Larry Rhodes, while recording a segment at a rural Arkansas jail. She invites him to speak to the audience and sing while playing his guitar, and his raw voice, folksy humor and personal charm make him instantly popular. Marcia dubs him \\"Lonesome\\" Rhodes and fast-tracks him onto his own radio program. Marcia enlists the support of the show's staff writer Mel Miller and witnesses the charismatic Rhodes ad-lib his way to Memphis-area popularity, effectively criticizing local politicians along the way. When he pokes fun at his sponsor, a mattress company, it initially pulls its ads, but when his adoring audience revolts, burning mattresses in the street, the sponsor discovers that Rhodes's irreverent pitches actually increased sales by 55%, and Rhodes returns to the air with a new awareness of his persuasive power. He begins an affair with Marcia and proposes to her. An ambitious office worker at the mattress company, Joey DePalma, puts together a deal for Rhodes to star in a new TV show in New York City. The sponsor is Vitajex, an energy supplement that Rhodes ingeniously reimagines as a yellow pill marketed as a male enhancement product. As his fame, influence, and ego increase, Rhodes is enlisted to improve the appeal of presidential hopeful Senator Worthington Fuller of California, and rebrands the stuffy conservative as an everyman with a folksy nickname. In contrast to his friendly onscreen persona, Rhodes has privately become an egomaniac who berates his staff. Marcia's hopes of marrying Rhodes are dashed, first when a woman turns up claiming to be his legitimate wife, and then when he returns from alleged divorce proceedings in Mexico, newly married to a 17-year-old drum majorette. Rhodes and Marcia enter into a profit-sharing agreement after she reminds him of her role in his success. Ultimately, Rhodes's ascent into fame and arrogance begins to turn on him. Joey has an affair with Rhodes's young wife. Rhodes dumps her and sends her back to Arkansas, but can't get out of his business arrangement with Joey, who threatens to reveal Rhodes's secrets. Rhodes visits Marcia, who has come to regret her role in making him famous while he proposed his \\"Fighters for Fuller\\" proposal. While Rhodes gets comfortable, Marcia leaves in the rain. To destroy him, she activates a live microphone over the end credits of his TV show that reveals Rhodes contemptuously mocking Fuller and the station's \\"idiot\\" viewers. His popularity and the show's ratings plummet, and the advertisers cancel their sponsorships, as Rhodes descends in an elevator to the ground floor. Rhodes returns to his penthouse, where he was scheduled to address the nation's business and political elite, only to find the room empty, except for his friend, Beanie, and a few African American servants, whom he dismisses when they don't respond to his demands. He discovers the truth during a phone call with Mel and Marcia and threatens suicide, but Marcia only goads him on. When the pair arrive at Rhodes's home, they find him speaking with an applause machine replacing the people whose support he lost. Marcia tells Rhodes that she was responsible for his open-microphone incident and demands that he never call her again. Before they leave, Mel lays out a prediction of Rhodes's future: his career is not completely over, and he will likely find further TV work soon, but never again enjoy the same level of popularity and prestige. After leaving the building, Mel and Marcia hear Rhodes screaming from the penthouse, for Marcia to return to him, but ignore him as they depart into the night in a taxi, as a Coca-Cola sign in neon lights flashes continuously. Cast Patricia Neal and Andy Griffith Production Most of the film's interiors were shot in New York at the Biograph Studios in the Bronx. This was preceded by shooting in Memphis and Piggott, Arkansas, where Rhodes meets Betty Lou. Contemporary newspapers reported an early 1956 trip by Kazan to Sarasota, Florida, to confer with Schulberg. Late in April, columnist Walter Winchell wrote that Griffith was due to leave the cast of his Broadway show No Time for Sergeants at the end of July, vacation for a month, and then begin shooting with Kazan. Kazan and Schulberg spent much of July and August 1956 in Memphis and in Arkansas, with Patricia Neal's involvement being announced by early August. Both Griffith and Lee Remick made their film debuts in Face. The most involved location shoot was in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, standing in for Piggott in the fair and baton- twirling competition scenes. Five thousand extras were sought, to be fed and paid $1 hourly for a mid-August day's work. Sixty baton twirlers and musicians from six different high school bands were rounded up from Arkansas and Missouri. Remick reported spending two weeks in Piggott living with teen twirler Amanda Robinson and her family, working on her twirling and local accent. Some of her baton-twirling scenes used a double. At the Piggott location shoot some 380 dogs were assembled from Missouri and Arkansas for the scene following Rhodes's first mass-action call on his audience: to take their dogs to the home of a local sheriff who was running for higher office to find out if a candidate is worthy of the office of dog catcher. Shooting in New York included 61 sets at Biograph Studios as well as some exteriors. The scene of the network headquarters switchboard was NBC, 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Anthony Franciosa, eager to work with Kazan, had turned down a more lucrative offer to appear in MGM's The Vintage. Schulberg remained involved throughout: \\"I went on a trip in 1955 to scout a location in Arkansas, and I've been on the set every day since shooting started in August [1956].\\" In stage performance, Griffith noted, he would work gradually up to his most intense moments, but needed to conjure that up spontaneously when shooting such scenes for Kazan. In some instances, he asked to have a few discarded chairs available to destroy, in order to work up his rage before filming. Big Jeff Bess, who portrayed the Sheriff under his own name, was a country singer and bandleader in Nashville who led Big Jeff and his Radio Playboys. He was once married to Tootsie Bess, owner of Tootsie's Orchid Lounge. Critical reception Upon its original release, A Face in the Crowd gained a mixed response, including Bosley Crowther's review for The New York Times. Though he applauded Griffith's performance (\\"Mr. Griffith plays him with thunderous vigor\\"), Crowther felt that the character overshadowed the rest of the cast and the story. \\"As a consequence, the dominance of the hero and his monstrous momentum ... eventually become a bit monotonous when they are not truly opposed.\\" Crowther found Rhodes \\"highly entertaining and well worth pondering when he is on the rise\\", but called the ending \\"inane\\". One critic who had only praise for the movie was Fran√ßois Truffaut; in his Cahiers du cin√©ma review, he called it \\"a great and beautiful work whose importance transcends the dimensions of a cinema review\\". Over the decades, critical opinion of the film has warmed considerably. A Face in the Crowd has an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The critical consensus reads, \\"A raucous Andy Griffith channels the corruptive influence of celebrity in Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd, a prescient critique of American media.\\" See also * List of American films of 1957 * The Great Man ReferencesExternal links  * * \\"Naming the Fictional Vitajex Pill in A Face in the Crowd (1957)\\"; Essay by Mark Griep * Short stories including \\"Your Arkansas Traveler\\", pp. 3‚Äì44. * * A Face in the Crowd ranked #14. * Category:1957 films Category:1950s political drama films Category:1950s satirical films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films about revenge Category:American political drama films Category:American satirical films Category:English-language films Category:Films about advertising Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films about radio people Category:Films about television Category:Films about television people Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films directed by Elia Kazan Category:Films set in Arkansas Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films set in Tennessee Category:Films shot in Arkansas Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in Tennessee Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:1957 drama films ","title":"A Face in the Crowd (film)"},{"id":"2019407","title":"Ali Azmat"},{"id":"2019410","text":"Schillinger is the surname of: * Joseph Schillinger (1895‚Äì1943), musician, developer of: ** The Schillinger System, a mathematical method of music composition * Josef Schillinger (1908‚Äì1943), SS officer, killed by Polish Jew Franceska Mann at Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust Characters on the HBO show Oz: * Vernon Schillinger * Andrew Schillinger * Hank Schillinger Category:German-language surnames ","title":"Schillinger"},{"id":"2019417","text":"FRED was a disk-based magazine for the SAM Coup√© brand of computer.

Also located on the island are the most important ministries, the Danish National Archives, the Royal Danish Library, several museums and the historic buildings of the Christian IV's Stock Exchange, the Chancellery and Christian IV's Brewhouse.Lars Bugge: Glemte broer i K√∏benhavn The population number was 18 people as of 1 January 2020. History Slotsholmen in 1674 with Copenhagen Castle, B√∏rsen and Christian IV's Naval Harbour The site used to consist of several small natural islands in the sound between the islands of Zealand and Amager. On the largest of these, Strandholmen (English: Beach Islet), Bishop Absalon of Roskilde constructed a small castle in 1167. In 1250 the castle was extended with two side towers to get the appearance that is now depicted on Copenhagen's Coat of Arms. The castle was conquered by the Hanseatic League 1368 and pulled down the following year as part of peace terms. Shortly after Copenhagen Castle was built on the same site and it became the residence for the Danish king in 1443. After the 1535-36 siege of Copenhagen during the Count's Feud, it became clear that the castle was outdated as a military installation, and King Christian III transformed the castle from a military stronghold to a more liveable royal residence. However, the reconstruction took place in a rather haphazard way and continued during the reign of the following kings, resulting in a rather irregular appearance of the castle. At the same time, it became clear that the castle was becoming too small to hold the functions necessary in order to function as a royal residence and seat of the administration so a series of smaller buildings began to be erected on Slotsholmen. Probably during the reign of Christian III a building was constructed on the quay of the canal in front of the castle to house the Chancellery. During the reign of Christian III and Frederick II an arsenal was constructed by the beach south of the castle, and during the reign of Frederick II probably also a supply depot. Slotsholmen from the south with Frederiksholms Canal to the left and the entrance to Christian IV's Naval Harbour in the middle (1750) Under King Christian IV Slotsholmen saw considerable development, especially in the southern part of the island. Here a new naval harbour was established, surrounded on one side by an Arsenal and on the other side by a Supply Depot. Other new buildings constructed were the Stock Exchange and the Brewhouse. All four of these historic buildings are still there today. By the time of the introduction of the absolute monarchy in 1660, the role of Slotsholmen as the centre of administration was firmly established. During the reign of King Frederick III, further lack of space in the castle led to the construction in 1665-1673 of an additional building between the Supply Depot and the Arsenal. This building, also still visible today, was to house the Cabinet of curiosities of the king, founded about 1650, and the Royal Library, founded in 1648. The rebuilt Copenhagen Castle about 1730 with the new Chancellery building to the left and the passageway linking the two buildings During the reign of King Frederick IV, a magnificent administration building was constructed in 1716-21 next to the palace adjacent to the Supply Depot. This new building was to house the chancelleries, thus replacing the previous chancellery building situated by the canal. The new chancellery building was connected to the castle by an arched passageway, thus allowing the king to stay in close contact with his government. The Chancellery Building (also known as the Red Building or the Building of Colleges) has functioned as the heart of the central administration for almost 300 years, and is today used by the Ministry of Finance. In spite of many attempts and projects to replace the small and antiquated castle with a more up-to-date royal residence fit for an absolute king, the old castle continued to exist well into the 18th century. Several renovations were made, most notably by Frederick IV in 1721-29. This rebuilding thoroughly changed the irregular appearance of the castle to a more regular shape. engraved illustration in Lauritz de Thurahs Den Danske Vitruvius from 1746 However, just two years after the rebuilding was completed, the Copenhagen Castle was demolished in 1731 to give room for three consecutive Christiansborg Palaces, the two first of which were destroyed by fires (in 1794 and 1884). Parts of the first and second Christianborg Palace still remain and is integrated in the present palace. The ruins of Absalon's Castle and the Copenhagen Castle are excavated and at display today under the present Christiansborg.

Nine bridges connect Slotsholmen to the rest of Copenhagen, both Zealand-side and Amager- side. =Knippelsbro= Knippelsbro is a bascule bridge and one of several bridges over Copenhagen's Inner Harbour; others being Langebro, Lille langebro, Bryggebroen and Copenhagen's Inner Harbour Bridge. It connects Slotsholmen to Christianshavn by extending B√∏rsgade to Torvegade. =Marmorbroen= Marmorbroen (English: The Marble Bridge) connects Christiansborg Riding Ground Complex to Ny Vestergade that continues to Dantes Plads with the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek. The bridge was constructed from 1739-45. It has a sandstone cladding with medallion ornamentation on the sides while to top is covered with marble. =Stormbroen= Stormbroen (English: The Assault Bridge) is a small arch bridge in stone, connecting Stormgade (towards The City Hall Square) with Vindebrogade on Slotsholmen. The bridge is named after the Assault on Copenhagen in 1659. It was at this very spot, where the city ramparts at that time was located, that the Swedish troops made their principal attack. After a series of defeats, the Danish troops finally gained victory, the Swedish troops leaving 2,000 dead soldiers in front of the ramparts at Stormgade. Various sources state that the bridge was erected in 1681 but on the side the inscription \\"erected in MDCLX is carved into its stone foundation. The bridge was renovated by Martin Nyrop in 1918. =H√∏jbro= H√∏jbro (English: High Bridge) is an arch bridge in wrought iron, connecting H√∏jbro Square with Slotsholmen. It is designed by Vilhelm Dahlerup and was built in 1878. Holmens Bro and B√∏rsbroen also used to be the work of Dahlerup but these gave both been replaced. The current bridge is not high at all. The name goes back to the wooden bascule bridge that was the first bridge to Slotsholmen. =Holmens Bro= Holmens Bro is an arch bridge built in granite in 1954 to replace Dahlerup's design from 1878.

With the course being 2,000 metres, the 10,000 metre race involves five loops. There is both a competition for amateurs who swim in the afternoon and a FINA Marathon Swimming World Cup event with US$11,000 in prize money that takes place in the morning. The swim takes place in August and water temperatures are 18-22 ¬∞C. The nature of the course makes it unusually good for spectators and that combined with the historical surroundings have gained it a reputation as one of the best open water swim competitions in Europe.

It formed part of the City of Victoria. West Point, a former cape where major government structures in Sai Wan are close to, also used to refer to Sai Wan. After Hong Kong's handover to People's republic of China, Sai Wan become the location for Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and people in Hong Kong tend to refer the name Sai Wan as the PRC office itself. .  History History of Sai Ying Pun= In the early 1800s, Sai Ying Pun was known as a place to settle the Chinese immigrants. It was built from the west of Tai Ping Shan. Europeans were also assigned to live in the same area. However, they were separated at the High Street where Chinese were excluded from living. In 1880, sewerage was installed into the area, with the main flow coming down Centre Street. Streets were covered with macadam and concreted at the same time. In 1890s, a severe epidemic outbreak of the bubonic plague afflicted Sai Ying Pun residents. Sheung Fung Lane residents were almost wiped out during the period.Pryor, E.G. (1975). \\"The Great Plague of Hong Kong\\" (PDF). Journal of the Hong Kong Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society.

IX health district and went into great detail about the buildings where the disease occurred. The neighboring area, Tai Ping Shan, was the most infected place in the city. It was resumed, abandoned and demolished to improve hygiene. =History of Shek Tong Tsui= The name of Shek Tong Tsui derived from a famous ancient stone pond, \\"Shek Tong\\" () in Cantonese, inside the area. The stone pond was located at modern-day Hill Road and The Belcher's, and was mined by the Hakka people since the 17th century. In 1903, the first land reclamation of Shek Tong Tsui was finished. In the meantime, the largest brothels in the city, which were located at the Possession Street, were destroyed by a big fire. Consequently, Hong Kong Governor Matthew Nathan decided to move all Hong Kong Island's brothels to Shek Tong Tsui in the early 1900s due to the large area recently claimed from the land reclamation. The place was then being well flourished as a red light district and came to its golden period. Numerous Cantonese opera theaters and restaurants were founded because of the business of brothels. It was the best place to entertain the affluent Chinese in Hong Kong. Queen's Road was the first road built in Hong Kong, constructed by the British from 1841 to 1843.Lim, Patricia Pui Huen (2002). Discovering Hong Kong's Cultural Heritage: Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Oxford University Press. p. 10. . It connected the Victoria City from Shek Tong Tsui to Wan Chai. Brothels in this area had also inspired numerous novels and Hong Kong films, most notably Rouge (1987), starring Anita Mui and Leslie Cheung. =History of Belcher Bay= Belcher Bay was named after Edward Belcher who landed on Possession Point at the north shore of Hong Kong Island and made the first British survey of Hong Kong Harbour on 25 January 1841. Belcher Bay, Gin Drinkers Bay and Tseung Kwan O were known as the 'Bay of Trash' in Hong Kong. Belcher's Street is the main street in Kennedy Town of Hong Kong. It connects Victoria Road and Queen's Road West. A small section in its west end built a turn around for Hong Kong Tramway. It is currently used as a site for ships to load and unload goods. =History of Kennedy Town= Kennedy Town was the western section of the historical Victoria City. It was named after the governor Arthur Edward Kennedy who initiated land reclamation along the coast of this area in 1886. It formed a narrow coastal strip of land that included the Kennedy Praya and the coastal area from Beach Street via Collinson Street to Shek Tong Tsui.Consultancy Agreement No. NEX/1023.

One of them is located at the Kennedy Town Temporary Recreation Ground at Sai Ning Street (). From 1933 to 1939, more land was reclaimed along the coast of Kennedy Town, yet the construction was suspended due to the Battle of Hong Kong in 1941.

This was the northernmost point on the western half of Hong Kong Island. The Hong Kong Government divided Victoria City into four wan (Áí∞), or districts.

EBA entered into force on 5 March 2001. There were transitional arrangements for bananas, sugar and rice until January 2006, July 2009 and September 2009 respectively. The EBA is part of the EU Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).Therefore the legal text can be found in the GSP regulation, art 12 and 13. The up-to-date list of all countries benefiting from such preferential treatment is given in Annex IV of the consolidated text of Regulation (EU) 978/2012. The aim of the scheme is to encourage the development of the world's poorest countries. Samoa, having graduated from LDC status in 2014 (becoming instead a developing country), was removed from the list of EBA beneficiaries on 1 January 2019. On January 16, 2019, the European Commission decided to re-introduce import duties on rice from Cambodia and Myanmar. This was done because imports of Indica rice from both countries combined have increased by 89% in the past five rice-growing seasons. At the same time, the prices were substantially lower than those on the EU market and had actually decreased over the same period. This surge in low-price imports has caused serious difficulties for EU rice producers to the extent that their market share in the EU dropped substantially from 61% to 29%.\\"EU imposes safeguard measures on rice from Cambodia and Myanmar\\", a press release by the European Commission.

The sport of quoits encompasses several distinct variations. History Game of ringtoss c. 1815 It is not until the 19th century that the game is documented in any detailed way. The official rules first appeared in the April 1881 edition of The Field, having been defined by a body formed from pubs in Northern England.Quoits Online A July 13, 1836 advertisement in the National Intelligencer (Washington, D.C.) touted facilities for \\"the manly and healthy amusements of quoits, ten-pin, fives, &c.;\\" on the premises of a \\"Coffee House\\" in Berkeley Springs, Virginia (now West Virginia). VariationsTraditional quoits= Rosario A.C., c. 1890 A game played with metal discs, traditionally made of steel, and thrown across a set distance at a metal spike (called a pin, hob or mott). The spike is centrally, and vertically, positioned in a square of moist clay measuring three feet across. United Kingdom The northern game = This version uses the 15 rules published in The Field in 1881 and has remained largely unchanged since that time. Played under the auspices of The National Quoits Association, formed in 1986. In this game, the pins are 11 yards apart, with their tops protruding three to four inches above the clay. Quoits measure about 5¬Ω inches in diameter and weigh around 5¬Ω pounds.Allen Valley League Rules = The long game = Sometimes called the old game, this version is played in Wales and Scotland; Scotland had around a dozen clubs, now reduced to one which is based in Stonehaven, under the control of the Scottish Quoiting Association, whilst Wales has only a few clubs, based around Dyfed and Powys. In this game, the top of the spike is flush with the clay, so encircling the pin is not a significant part of the game. The long game has similarities to the game of bowls, in that a player scores a point for each quoit nearer to the pin than his opponent. The hobs are 18 yards apart, while the quoits are typically around nine inches in diameter and weigh up to 11 pounds, almost double that of the northern game. = East Anglian quoits = An English version of the long game, played using quoits of reduced size and weight. As with the long game, the hobs are 18 yards apart, but their tops are raised above the level of the clay. Quoits that land cleanly over the hob score two points, regardless of the opponent's efforts, and are removed immediately, prior to the next throw. Quoits which land on their backs, or inclined in a backwards direction, are also removed immediately United States Traditional American 4lb quoits. The standard for American Quoits is governed by the United States Quoiting Association. The USQA was created in April 2003. The USQA unified a specific standard for the 4 Lb quoit. Each regulation set of USQA Quoits includes 4 foundry-cast steel quoits in perfect proportion to the historical Traditional American Quoit. Each quoit weighs 4 pounds and is approximately 6 1/2 inches in diameter, has a 3-inch diameter hole, and stands 1 inch high. Since 2003 the USQA has conducted annual tournaments culminating in a World Championship in both singles and doubles as well as a season ending points champion. Mexican Americans play this game in the U.S. southwest and call it \\"wacha\\". =Indoor or table quoits= A game of indoor quoits, being played in the Forest of Dean Exclusively a pub game, this variant is predominantly played in mid and south Wales and in England along its border with Wales. Matches are played by two teams (usually the host pub versus another pub) and typically consist of four games of singles, followed by three games of doubles. Players take it in turns to pitch four rubber rings across a distance of around 8¬Ω feet onto a raised quoits board. The board consists of a central pin or spike and two recessed sections: an inner circular section called the dish and a circular outer section. Five points are awarded for a quoit landing cleanly over the pin, two points for a quoit landing cleanly in the dish, and one point for a quoit landing cleanly on the outer circular section of the board. The scoreboard consists of numbers running from 1 to 10, 11 or 12, and the object of the game is to score each of these numbers separately using four or fewer quoits, the first side to achieve this being the winner. =Deck quoits= Deck quoits is a variant which is popular on cruise ships. The quoits are invariably made of rope, so as to avoid damaging the ship's deck, but there are no universally agreed standards or rules - partly because of the game's informal nature and partly because the game has to adapt to the shape and area of each particular ship it is played upon. Players take it in turn to throw three or four hoops at a target which usually, though not always, consists of concentric circles marked on the deck. The centre point is called the jack. Occasionally this may take the form of a raised wooden peg, but more usually it is marked on the surface in the same way that the concentric circles are. =Slate-board quoits= This is a popular outdoor variation played principally in and around Pennsylvania, USA (specifically the 'Slate Belt' which is in the Lehigh Valley). This game uses two one-pound rubber quoits per player, which are pitched at a short metal pin mounted on a heavy 24x24x1 inch slab of slate. The common pronunciation of quoits in the Slate Belt region is (qwaits). Players take turns throwing a quoit at the pin. The quoit nearest the pin gets one point. If one player has two quoits nearer the pin than either of his opponent's quoits, he gets two points. A quoit that encircles the pin (called a ringer) gets three points. If all four quoits are ringers, the player who threw the last ringer gets three points only; otherwise, the first player to make 21 points wins the game. For two or four players. =Garden quoits or hoopla= Typical set of garden quoits This version of the game exists largely as a form of recreation, or as a game of skill found typically at fairgrounds and village fetes. There are no leagues or universally accepted standards of play and players normally agree upon the rules before play commences. Garden quoit and hoopla sets can be purchased in shops and usually involve players taking it in turns to throw rope or wooden hoops over one or more spikes. The fairground version typically involves a person paying the stallholder for the opportunity to throw one or more wooden hoops over a prize, which if done successfully, they can keep. Generally speaking, the odds of winning are normally heavily weighted in favour of the stallholder unless the cost of play is higher than the value of the prize.

O'Conor's work demonstrates Impressionist and Post-Impressionist influence. Early life and training Born in Milltown, Castleplunket, County Roscommon in Ireland, O'Conor attended the Metropolitan School and Royal Hibernian Academy early in his career. His father, Roderic Joseph O'Conor, acted as a justice of the peace and was appointed high sheriff of the county in 1863. His mother, Eleanor Mary, was brought up in a landowning family from Co Meath. The family relocated to Dublin when O'Conor was still a child. He studied at Ampleforth College, and like his classmate, Richard Moynan, travelled to Antwerp before moving to Paris to gain further experience. While in France, he was influenced by the Impressionists. Works and legacy In 1892 O'Conor went to Pont-Aven in Brittany where he worked closely with a group of artists around the Post-Impressionist Paul Gauguin, whom he befriended. His method of painting with textured strokes of contrasting colours also owed much to Van Gogh. His nephew, Patrick O'Connor (1909‚Äì97), was also a painter as well as a sculptor. O'Conor died in Nueil-sur-Layon, France in March 1940. In March 2011 a work by O'Conor sold for ¬£337,250 (‚Ç¨383,993). Landscape, Cassis, an oil-on- canvas, was painted by O'Conor in the south of France in 1913 and sold at Sotheby's for significantly higher than the estimate price. Relationship with Somerset Maugham In the early twentieth century, O'Conor was one of a group of painters, writers and intellectuals who frequented the Chat Blanc, a restaurant in the rue d'Odessa near the Gare Montparnasse in Paris, a group that included Gerald Kelly, Aleister Crowley and the young Somerset Maugham. O'Conor \\"took an immediate dislike to Maugham, who later recalled that his presence at the table seemed to irritate the Irishman and he had only to venture a remark to have O'Conor attack it.\\" Maugham had his revenge on O'Conor by using him as the basis for two fictional characters, O'Brien in The Magician and Clutton in Of Human Bondage.

It is situated in Park Town, Luton, and is down the line from London St Pancras between to the south and to the north. Its three-letter station code is LTN, also the IATA code for the airport. The station is served by Thameslink operated trains on the Thameslink route and by East Midlands Railway. It is situated approximately west of the airport, to which it is linked by a chargeable shuttle bus service.  History  The station was opened in 1999, specifically to serve Luton Airport. Initially it was linked to the airport by free shuttle buses operated by National Car Parks on behalf of the airport's owners. In January 2008 the free shuttle bus service was replaced by a more frequent, but chargeable, service provided by First Capital Connect. Now that Govia are once again operating Thameslink, the service is planned to revert to being free. In November 2008, the station became the first on the Thameslink route to have its platforms extended in order to accommodate twelve-coach trains as part of the Thameslink Programme. In April 2013, a new northern entrance was opened on Kimpton Road, Luton.  Future  Luton DART, a light rail link is planned to link Luton Airport Parkway station to the airport. The ¬£200 million link, scheduled to open in 2021, is being funded by Luton Borough Council and will be designed by the engineering firm Arup. The link will be operated 24 hours a day by an automated guided people mover which would offer a 5-minute transfer time between Parkway station and the airport terminal. The major challenge faced by railway engineers building a rail link here is that the railway station, although located adjacent to the airport perimeter, lies around 40 metres downhill from the airport. The project will involve the construction of bridges over the neighbouring A1081 dual carriageway and tunnels, along with three new stations. The light rail platforms at the Parkway station will be built on a new level above the current main line rail platforms. A planning application was submitted in 2016, and the link was approved by Luton Borough Council in June 2017. Negotiations are underway with the Department for Transport to extend the validity of the Oyster card contactless ticketing system to the airport by 2018.

Rationale Pointing with a yad on an open Torah scroll. A yad resting on an open Torah scroll. Beyond its practical usage in pointing out letters, the yad ensures that the parchment is not touched during the reading. There are several reasons for this: handling the parchment renders one ritually impure and the often-fragile parchment is easily damaged. Moreover, the vellum parchment does not absorb ink so touching the scroll with fingers will damage the lettering. While not required when chanting from the Torah, it is used frequently and is considered a (\\"embellishment of the commandment\\") of reading the Torah. =Manufacture= A yad can be made of any number of materials, though silver is common, especially used in crowning the yad. The yad is often shaped like a long rod, capped by a small hand with its index finger pointing from it. In some cases a yad is covered with fabric.

It was discovered by Ernesto Schiaparelli (the director of the Egyptian Museum in Turin) in 1904. It is called the Sistine Chapel of Ancient Egypt. Nefertari, which means \\"beautiful companion\\", was Ramesses II's favorite wife; he went out of his way to make this obvious, referring to her as \\"the one for whom the sun shines\\" in his writings, built the Temple of Hathor to idolize her as a deity, and commissioned portraiture wall paintings. In the Valley of the Queens, Nefertari's tomb once held the mummified body and representative symbolisms of her, like what most Egyptian tombs consisted of. Now, everything had been looted except for two thirds of the 5,200 square feet of wall paintings. For what still remains, these wall paintings characterized Nefertari's character. Her face was given a lot of attention to emphasize her beauty, especially the shape of her eyes, the blush of her cheeks, and her eyebrows. Some paintings were full of lines and color of red, blue, yellow, and green that portrayed exquisite directions to navigating through the afterlife to paradise. Decoration and layout Map of QV66's layout A flight of steps cut out of the rock gives access to the antechamber, which is decorated with paintings based on Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead.Alberto Siliotti, Kemet: temples, people, gods,1994 This astronomical ceiling represents the heavens and is painted in dark blue, with a myriad of golden five-pointed stars. The east wall of the antechamber is interrupted by a large opening flanked by representation of Osiris at left and Anubis at right; this in turn leads to the side chamber, decorated with offering scenes, preceded by a vestibule in which the paintings portray Nefertari being presented to the gods who welcome her. On the north wall of the antechamber is the stairway that goes down to the burial chamber. This latter is a vast quadrangular room covering a surface area about 90 square meters, the astronomical ceiling of which is supported by four pillars entirely covered with decoration. Originally, the queen's red granite sarcophagus lay in the middle of this chamber. According to religious doctrines of the time, it was in this chamber, which the ancient Egyptians called the \\"golden hall\\" that the regeneration of the deceased took place. This decorative pictogram of the walls in the burial chamber drew inspirations from chapters 144 and 146 of the Book of the Dead: in the left half of the chamber, there are passages from chapter 144 concerning the gates and doors of the kingdom of Osiris, their guardians, and the magic formulas that had to be uttered by the deceased in order to go past the doors. The tomb itself is primarily focused on the Queen‚Äôs life and on her death. Of the wall full of paintings, the \\"Queen playing Draughts\\" is a portrayal of Nefertari playing the game of Senet. A whole entire wall was dedicated to show the Queen at play, demonstrating the importance of the game of Senet. Interpretations suggest that a physical board game of Senet may have possibly been stolen, along with the body and other symbolic images of Nefertari. Nefertari may have been very clever, and possibly have been a writer in her lifetime. ^4 This can be alluded because of a painting in the tomb of Nefertari coming before the god of writing and literacy to proclaim her title as a scribe. Nefertari lived an elegant life on earth, and she is also promised an elegant afterlife. Chapter 17 of the Book of the Dead, which tells a spell for the Queen, is inscribed on the tomb. This spell is supposed to guide Nefertari on how to transform into a ba, which is a bird. For Nefertari to become a bird in the afterlife holds a promise of freedom to move around. Ramesses‚Äô affection for his wife, as written on her tomb's walls, shows clearly that Egyptian queens were not simply marriages of convenience or marriages designed to accumulate greater power and alliances, but, in some cases at least, were actually based around some kind of emotional attachment. Nefertari‚Äôs origins are unknown except that it is thought that she was a member of the nobility, although while she was queen her brother Amenmose held the position of Mayor of Thebes. By contemporary standards, the real value of the paintings found within the tomb is that they are the best preserved and most detailed source of the ancient Egyptian‚Äôs journey towards the afterlife. The tomb features several extracts from the Book of the Dead from chapters 148, 94, 146, 17 and 144 and tells of all the ceremonies and tests taking place from the death of Nefertari up until the end of her journey, depicted on the door of her burial chamber, in which Nefertari is reborn and emerges from the eastern horizon as a sun disc, forever immortalized in victory over the world of darkness. The details of the ceremonies concerning the afterlife also tell us much about the duties and roles of many major and minor gods during the reign of the 19th Dynasty in the New Kingdom. Gods mentioned on the tomb walls include Isis, Osiris, Anubis, Hathor, Neith, Serket, Ma'at, Wadjet, Nekhbet, Amunet, Ra and Nephthys. Unfortunately by the time that Schiaparelli rediscovered Nefertari‚Äôs tomb it had already been found by tomb raiders, who had stolen all the treasure buried with the Queen, including her sarcophagus and mummy. Parts of the mummy's knees were found in the burial chamber, and were taken to the Egyptian Museum in Turin by Schiaparelli, where they are still kept today. Closure The tomb was closed to the public in 1950 because of various problems that threatened the paintings, which are considered to be the best preserved and most eloquent decorations of any Egyptian burial site. The paintings are found on almost every available surface in the tomb, including thousands of stars painted on the ceiling of the burial chamber on a blue background to represent the sky. After the discovery of the tomb, scientists found deterioration in many paintings caused by water damage, bacterial growth, salt formation, and recently, the humidity of visitors' breath. In 1986, an operation to restore all the paintings within the tomb and to replace over 3,000 years worth of dust and soot with paper pasted to the fragile walls and ceilings to preserve the paintings was embarked upon by the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation and the Getty Conservation Institute; the actual restoration work began in 1988 and was completed in April 1992. Upon completion of the restoration work, Egyptian authorities decided to severely restrict public access to the tomb in order to preserve the delicate paintings found within. Five years later, Egypt's Prime Minister, Hisham Zazao, declared the tomb to be reopened to visitors, 150 visitors at a time. In 2006, the tomb was restricted to visitors once again, except for private tours of a maximum of 20 people purchasing a license for 3000 USD. As of November 2019, holders of a 1400 EGP entry ticket or a premium Luxor pass can visit this tomb. To this day, the Getty Conservation Institute regularly monitors the tomb.

Originally presented biennially in March from 2003, since 2013 AFF has been held in October. Subject to funding, the festival stages full or briefer events in alternating years; some form of event has taken place every year since 2015. It has a strong focus on local South Australian and Australian produced content, with the Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund (AFFIF) established to fund investment in Australian films. Established in 2003, it was listed in Variety's \\"50 Unmissable Film Festivals\\" in 2007. The 2020 Adelaide Film Festival is scheduled to take place from 14 to 25 October in cinemas, with some outdoor premieres also, including at the Warriparinga Wetlands. https://adelaidefilmfestival.org/event/the-personal-history-of- david-copperfield/ History An independently financed Adelaide International Film Festival (AIFF) had been held from 1959 to 1980. The idea of a new film festival to stimulate the local film industry and celebrate the 30th anniversary of the South Australian Film Corporation was raised by South Australian Premier Hon. Mike Rann in 2002, and a director and board were appointed. The Adelaide Film Festival Investment Fund was created to fund the Film Festival and other events. The inaugural Adelaide (International) Film Festival was held from 28 February to 3 March 2003. It ran a programme of screenings, special events and forums in a number of cinemas across Adelaide. After its first edition, the festival ceased to use International in its title,Legislation denoting a withdrawal from FIAPF membership. It was known as the BigPond Adelaide Film Festival, or BAFF, for a period until 2011, as its main sponsor had been BigPond (now Telstra Media). =Festival directors= Katrina Sedgwick was the Festival's founding director in 2002. She had previously co-founded the 1995 Sydney Fringe Festival, was the Special Events Producer (1998, 2000) for the Adelaide Festival of Arts, and the Artistic Director for the 2002 Adelaide Fringe. In 2007, Sedgwick introduced an international jury prize to the festival. At the time of her stepping down from the role of Festival director in 2013, Sedgwick said that the festival was the first in Australia to introduce an international competition, and a production fund, and that ticket sales had grown by 20 per cent each year. 2013 was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director, after spending eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s. = ADLFF events = Since the first event in 2003, the Festival has been held (originally in odd-numbered years) in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2016 (a one-off \\"Rogue\\" event), 2017, 2018, and a \\"pop-up\\" weekend festival in March 2019. Since 2017, Festival events have taken place mainly at the GU Filmhouse in Hindley Street (defunct as of October 1, 2020), with some sessions at the smaller Mercury Cinema in Morphett Street. Audiences have grown year on year, with an audience of more than 64,000 people in 2018, and estimated to have had an impact of on the state's economy. In 2020, most screenings will be hosted by Palace Nova at their Eastend and Prospect locations, with some showings at Mitcham Wallis Cinemas at Mitcham Square Shopping Centre, Odeon Star in Semaphore and at Tandanya.  2013: 10‚Äì20 October  The 6th Adelaide Film Festival took place from 10 to 20 October 2013. This was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director (after eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s), having taken over from Katrina Sedgwick. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton served as the festival's patrons. Scott Hicks received the 2013 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry. The poster in 2013 depicted Screen Worship, which celebrates work for all screens‚Äîcinema, television, phone and computer.  2015: 15‚Äì25 October  The 7th Adelaide Film Festival was held from 15 to 25 October 2015. Amanda Duthie was again the Festival Director. On the opening night of the festival, Director and screenwriter Andrew Bovell received the 2015 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry. The festival opened with Scott Hicks's documentary film Highly Strung, and closed with Paolo Sorrentino's drama film Youth. More than 180 feature films were screened at the festival, 40 of which were Australian films, 24 South Australian films and total of 51 countries were represented at the Festival. As part of the 2015 Adelaide Film Festival, a public art installation was presented, incorporating a Laneway Cinema in Cinema Place, showing moving image artworks, and a 'Reactive Wall', where six artists created 2D visual artworks live in response to content within the festival.  2016: 27‚Äì30 October  Having previously been held biennially, the highlight of \\"AFF Goes Rogue\\" in October 2016 was a 4-day \\"mini-festival\\" in the in-between year.

The purpose of the Foundation is to promote, stimulate, support and participate in any possible manner in cultural, educational, intellectual, artistic, social, philanthropic, scientific or sports initiatives, works and enterprises, in their most relevant aspects. To achieve its goals, the Foundation instituted the Konex Awards to be granted to personalities and institutions standing out for his, her or its achievements in any of the aforementioned fields. The Konex Awards were instituted in 1980 to be annually granted to sow for the future so that the most distinguished contemporary personalities and institutions in every field, which compose the cultural spectrum of the nation, will be an example to the nation's youths.'Historia de los premios Konex' Clar√≠n Every year the Konex Foundation offers those awards in different activities in the nation, in cycles that repeat themselves every ten years. Initially and in the ten-year span from 1980 to 1989, such personalities received awards for their life-time accomplishments. As from 1990 to 1999 the accomplishments to receive awards represented the last ten years of activity. From the year 2000 through 2009 such cycle is repeated, and it will be repeated indefinitely.Konex Awards chronology Konex Foundation *1980 1990 2000 2010 Sports *1981 1991 2001 2011 Entertainment *1982 1992 2002 2012 Visual Arts *1983 1993 2003 2013 Science and Technology *1984 1994 2004 2014 Literature *1985 1995 2005 2015 Popular Music *1986 1996 2006 2016 Humanities *1987 1997 2007 2017 Communication, Journalism *1988 1998 2008 2018 Institutions, Community, Enterprise *1989 1999 2009 2019 Classical Music Selection and awards Every year a Grand Jury including 20 members is appointed. The members are specialists in the specific subjects receiving the award, and they appoint their own president. The members of the Jury exclude themselves from being chosen for a Konex Award; a gesture that the Foundation emphasizes and thanks very specially. Each year the activity receiving a prize is classified by the Grand Jury into 20 disciplines. The Grand Jury selects the recipients for the following awards: *Konex Merit Diploma *Platinum Konex *Diamond Konex *Honour Konex *Mercosur Konex The Grand Jury selects the five personalities or institutions that show the most remarkable accomplishments in each of the 20 chosen disciplines, awarding each of these 100 personalities or institutions a Merit Diploma in a public ceremony. Then the Grand Jury selects one figure out of the five awarded to receive the Platinum Konex. Among the 20 Platinum Konex winners, the Grand Jury selects the Diamond Konex recipient, the most outstanding personality or institution considered the most relevant figure of the activity. The Honour Konex is granted to an outstanding deceased personality. The Grand Jury also has the power to grant Special Mentions to those who are considered worthy of the award but do not specifically fit within given disciplines. Since 2002 the Grand Jury has the authority to grant the Mercosur Konex to the most relevant living personalities of the countries linked to Mercosur. All awards are presented in a final, special ceremony in which the recipients are granted a distinctive symbol called Konex Trophy.History of Konex Awards at Clar√≠n The Konex Foundation further has the authority to grant the Konex Decoration to honor personalities who have brilliant careers around the world, for their contribution to universal culture.

Austin was selected for the 1999 World Cup squad, and opened the bowling with Darren Gough in England's opening game, taking 2‚Äì25 against Sri Lanka at Lord's. However, his international career was to last just one more match, against Kenya later in the same tournament. He spent the rest of his career at Lancashire, where his benefit in 2000 raised ¬£155,000. Austin played no first-class cricket after early June 2001, but continued to appear in some one-day games for another year. After some appearances for Cumberland in 2002, and participating in the Lancashire League's Worsley Cup final the following year, Austin retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2003 season. He returned to the Leagues playing with distinction for St Annes in the Northern Premier League, before returning to his boyhood club, Baxenden and helping them to the Ribblesdale League title, before retiring from all cricket at the end of the 2010 season.

The almost completely froze bank accounts and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar- denominated accounts. The Spanish word corralito is the diminutive form of corral, which means \\"corral, animal pen, enclosure\\"; the diminutive is used in the sense of \\"small enclosure\\" and also \\"a child's playpen\\". This expressive name alludes to the restrictions imposed by the measure. The term was coined by the journalist Antonio Laje.* Background and initial measures In 2001, Argentina was in the midst of a crisis: heavily indebted, with an economy in complete stagnation (an almost three-year-long recession), and the exchange rate was fixed at one U. S. dollar per Argentine peso by law, which made exports uncompetitive and effectively deprived the state of having an independent monetary policy. Many Argentines, but most especially companies, fearing an economic crash and possibly a devaluation, were transforming pesos to dollars and withdrawing them from the banks in large amounts, usually transferring them to foreign accounts (capital flight).\\"The Man Who Came In from the Crash\\" - Harvard Independent. On December 1, 2001, in order to stop this draining from destroying the banking system, the government froze all bank accounts, initially for 90 days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed for withdrawal on a weekly basis (initially 250 Argentine pesos, then 300), and only from accounts denominated in pesos. No withdrawals were allowed from accounts denominated in U.S. dollars, unless the owner agreed to convert the funds into pesos.\\"The crisis in Argentina\\" - socialistworld.net Operations using credit cards, debit cards, cheques and other means of payment could be conducted normally, but the lack of cash availability caused numerous problems for the general public and for businesses. Immediate effects A protest against the banks in 2002. The large sign reads \\"Thieving banks - give back our dollars\\". The corralito caused an immediate backfire on the government. Even more people started trying to withdraw their money from the banks, and many ended up in court fighting for their right to have their funds (and being granted that right on occasion). The main reason for ending up in court was that, after the corralito, and after Economy Minister Cavallo resigned, the new government led by Eduardo Duhalde and his Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna converted those funds nominated in US dollars into Argentine pesos at a 1 peso = 1 US dollar exchange rate, while the exchange rate was liberalized (immediately going to 4 pesos = 1 US dollar). The same was done with debtors, so many private enterprises and also the Province of Buenos Aires were favoured by this measure as they managed to decrease their debts. Nine years later, several people had not yet been able to recover their savings because of the pace of justice in Argentina. However, debtors were able to purchase properties and other items by paying their debts at the 1 to 1 exchange rate. At the time, the average Argentine did not employ the banking system for daily uses; many did not have a personal bank account, and dealt only with cash. Debit cards were not popular and many businesses did not have the equipment to accept them. Thus the cash restrictions only exacerbated the recession and angered the public. President Fernando de la R√∫a resigned on 20 December 2001 after violent riots, but the restrictions of the corralito were not lifted at the time.\\"Oxford Analytica Brief: Argentina's Economic and Political Situation\\" -United Jewish Communities  Corral√≥n  Argentina's situation worsened for several months. The corralito was hardened during the interim rule of President Eduardo Duhalde, and turned into a corral√≥n (\\"big corral\\"). The corral√≥n differed from the corralito in that most deposits were forcibly exchanged for a series of bonds denominated in pesos. The dollar-denominated accounts were automatically exchanged for pesos and peso bonds at a predetermined rate. The real necessity of such decision was questioned by several observers at the time, and some suggested this move benefited some large companies which were insolvent (or nearly so) whose owners had sent their dollars abroad before the corralito; these owners were thus able to repay their companies' now devalued debts by converting much fewer dollars than it would have taken previously. The peso was first devalued (from 1.0 to 1.4 pesos/dollar)\\"Cautious reaction to peso devaluation\\" - BBC News. and then floated, thereby quickly depreciating to a maximum rate of nearly 4 pesos per dollar.\\"El peso argentino toca fondo\\" - BBC Mundo. Argentina's economy then gradually began a recovery from its abysmal state, spurred by exports that benefited from the heightened exchange rate, and by the declaration of default on most of its debt, which left the government with more money available to expand the economy.\\"Becoming a serious country\\" - Economist. The banks and their role in the crisis Depositors protesting frozen accounts for fear they might lose value, or worse. February 2002. It is generally agreed that the banks had a share of the blame for the situation that led to the corralito.\\"The Argentine Crisis: A Chronology of Events After The Sovereign Default\\" - Standard & Poor's In mid-2001, it was probably clear to bank owners and high-ranking officials that Argentina's banking system was going to crash, and some in fact may have spurred this outcome by letting their highest deposit holders know this news. These, mostly large companies, quickly moved their deposits abroad. Meanwhile, they continued to recommend their middle- class customers to enter deposits. It is also believed that in the end the corralito ended up being good business for some international banks since they negotiated with the Argentine government to receive compensation bonds for the \\"missing\\" money, which in a large proportion had never really left their banks, only moved from one branch to another.\\"Argentina: Program for a Popular Economic Recovery\\" - Monthly Review. Most banks stayed in the country during the crisis, withstanding a severe damage to their reputation as well as (in certain cases) physical attacks. Others fled as soon as problems arose (for example, Scotiabank's Argentine branch, Scotiabank Quilmes). The end of the corralito The corralito officially ended on December 2, 2002, when Minister of Economy Roberto Lavagna announced the liberation of deposits for about 23.7 billion pesos (though not of 17.3 billion pesos in formerly dollar-denominated long-term accounts).\\"Argentina: lleg√≥ el fin del 'corralito'\\" - BBC Mundo. The measure was coupled with exchange market controls, by which no person or business was allowed to buy more than 100,000 dollars; this was done to prevent the possible effects of the sudden availability of pesos.

Synopsis  The film tells the story of an archetypal human life using images taken from all around the world and the last 100 years of cinema. The images span the microcosm (inside the body), through the individual (the first cry of a new-born baby), to the macrocosm (accumulated archive footage of ritual celebration and the carnage of war). The editing, music, and the mythic narrative arc of the material is designed to take the viewer on a roller coaster tour of the human body and life cycle. Every possible depiction of the human life from microscopic medical to portraits and newsreels, from births to deaths, are cut to a music track by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead to create a mythic narrative of the arc of a single life. Hollywood director Paul Thomas Anderson saw the film at its Rotterdam Festival premiere: \\"I remember seeing Bodysong and feeling like I was in a trance. A wonderful collection of the two simple things a film has to work with: pictures and music. It's a moving, scary and hypnotic potpourri of images and an experience that gets more lucid the more you watch ...The website, which is 50% of the experience is a testament to the strong, caring research and a dedication to wonderful material.\\" Release The film was released by Path√© in 2003 with a limited collector's edition released on DVD by the BFI in 2010, which included original essays by William Gibson, Geoff Andrew, Gareth Evans and Matt Hanson.

The second component carries a pintle fitting, the male counterpart to the gudgeon, enabling an interpivoting connection that can be easily separated. Designs that may use gudgeon and pintle connections include hinges, shutters and boat rudders.Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary, G & C Merriam Company, 1963, p. 370 The gudgeon derives from the Middle English gojoun, which originated from the Middle French goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century. Types of gudgeonsWinged gudgeons= Gudgeons on the end of a shaft, A & B. A winged gudgeon is one that has extensions that increase its ability to adhere to the fixed surface. At the beginning of the industrial revolution, winged gudgeons were used to support water wheel shafts,Niles, H. (ed.) (1817) \\"Winged Gudgeons\\" Niles' National Register Vol. 12 (March - September 1817), Franklin Press, Baltimore, MD, pp. 282-284 and later, steam engine shafts. =Gudgeon pin= In engines, a gudgeon pin (UK, wrist pin US) joins the small end of a connecting rod to a piston or crosshead. UsageBuildings= In buildings pintles and gudgeons are used for working shutters. Shutters were traditionally used to protect the glazing as well as help keep heat in the building at night during the colder months. Shutters are experiencing a comeback as protection from wind-borne storm debris. Architects have made use of both reclaimed historical shutter hardware as well as used stainless sailing hardware for new projects. Other uses are closet doors, barn doors, storm doors, etc. All uses require hold backs of some sort to keep shutter or door from \\"flapping in the wind\\". =Sailing= In sailing, pintles insert into gudgeons that are normally affixed to the transom of a boat. Normally, the corresponding pintle fitting on the rudder slides, lowers or clips into the gudgeon. There are variations where gudgeons are mounted to the rudder and boat, and a pivot clevis pin is inserted into these gudgeons, or the pintles are fastened to the boat, and gudgeons are attached to the rudder. In any case, the fitting with the hole is referred to as a gudgeon. They are used to attach the rudder to the boat so that it can swing freely. The rudder can then be turned with the tiller. There must be at least two gudgeon/pintle sets for stability in the rudder's attachment to the transom. The pintles must face the same direction for insertion into the gudgeons and usually one is a bit longer so it can be the first into its gudgeon, giving some stability for the insertion of the other pintle. To prevent the rudder from rising out of the gudgeons there is often some preventer such as rudder weight or a locking device slid across the path of the pintle's removal from the upper gudgeon (also referred to as a Rudder Stop).http://www.rigrite.com/Hardware/Rudder_Hardware/Pintles&Gudgeons.htm; Really good installations (gudgeons) have bushings, (plain bearing) either a solid sleeve, flanged or clenched. This will allow for smoother operation of the helm and preserve the pintles and gudgeons. A bushing can be seen as \\"consumable\\". On some boats there are split pins/split rings through the pintail to stop gudgeons lifting. https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Small_Boat_Rudder.jpg In addition while the bottom fitting is a gudgeon turning on a pintail the upper two fittings are a pair of gudgeons each with a pin joining them with split pin/washer to stop them coming out. =Lock Gates= In navigations locks, the upper pivot point for a miter gate is referred to as the gudgeon, and carries horizontal loads caused by a gate leaf hanging with no water load.

Early life Richard Oakes was born in Perivale, West London, and grew up in the Parkstone area of Poole, Dorset in southwestern England. He first started playing when he came across a Spanish guitar that his sister owned. The album that initially influenced him to pursue a career in music was The Story of the Clash, Volume 1, which he heard when he was 12. Prior to joining Suede, Oakes played in a band called \\"TED\\" along with his friends Peter Field (vocals) and Colin Forbes (Rhythm guitar). The band was actually originally titled 'PIPATED' ‚Äì 'Plug in Peter and the Electric Daffodils'. Suede The first gig Oakes attended was one of Suede's at the Poole Arts Centre in May 1993. Upon hearing that guitarist Bernard Butler had left the band and that the band were auditioning for a replacement, he recorded versions of Suede songs and some of his own material on a 4 track recorder, which he sent to the band's fanclub along with a note that read \\"Take me or leave me.\\" When drummer Simon Gilbert heard Anderson playing back the tape whilst going through audition tapes, he mistakenly believed it to be an early Suede demo. After the second audition Oakes was invited to join the band. At the age of 17, and after beating approximately five hundred candidates, Oakes officially joined Suede on 17 September 1994 (exactly 2 weeks before his 18th birthday). Oakes first public appearance with the band was on Top of the Pops, while his first full live appearance was at a secret fan club gig at London's Raw Club on 10 October 1994. The first song he performed live, and the first video he appeared in, was \\"We are the Pigs\\". His first co-writing credits were the B-sides of single \\"New Generation\\", \\"Together\\" and \\"Bentswood Boys\\". Oakes went on to co-write many songs with Anderson on subsequent albums and B-side material, several of which went on to become hit singles in the UK. Oakes joined his former bandmates for three UK Suede concerts in 2010,Suede play first gig in seven years, NME.com, 21 March 2010 (retrieved 16 April 2010) followed by a concert at London's O2 Arena in December of that year, then festival appearances in Sweden, Hultsfredsfestivalen in July and Denmark and Norway in August. Suedes's reunion continued with their sixth album, Bloodsports, on which Oakes co-wrote all but two of the songs, released in March 2013. Suede released their seventh album Night Thoughts on 22 January 2016 to widespread critical acclaim. Oakes co-wrote all but four of the songs. It was accompanied by a feature film, directed by Roger Sargent. During their 2016 tour the band performed the first half of their set from behind a screen onto which Sargent's film was projected.

Baal I was a king of Tyre (680‚Äì660 BC). His name is the same as that of the Phoenician deity, Baal. He was tributary to the Assyrians, who had conquered the rest of Phoenicia.  Treaty with Esarhaddon  In c. 675 BC, Baal I entered into a vassal treaty with Esarhaddon (currently in the British Museum) in exchange for Tyre's trading rights. These two rulers are possibly depicted together on the Victory stele of Esarhaddon, issued in c. 670 BC. In the stele, which was erected to commemorate the defeat of Egypt, the figure that supposedly represents the Phoenician king was shown with pierced lips tied to strings that were coiled around Esarhaddon's left hand. Sources noted that Baal I was a prominent vassal and may have enjoyed exceptional favor in Assyria due to several factors. His navy helped the Assyrians capture Abdi-Milkuti, the king of Sidon, and cement Assyrian authority in Cyprus. He may also have assisted the Assyrians in their war against Elam. Baal I was also the first ruler in the list of tributaries who provided materials for Esarhaddon's palace at Nineveh. By 671, BC Baal I defied Assyria after it secured an alliance with Taharqo, king of Cush. Fearing strong reprisal, Baal I later surrendered, ceding most of his mainland towns. His daughters were sent to the Assyrian king along with substantial dowries. Scholars, however, cited that Esarhaddon failed to conquer Tyre. Baal I was never captured and he kept his throne. While Esarhaddon claimed in the Victory Stele that he conquered the city, he merely managed to blockade the island, cutting it from its supply of water and food.  Ashurbanipal's reign  The king of Tyre was again cited in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon's son Ashurbanipal. He was first mentioned for his participation in the king's second campaign along the Delta and the Nile valley to establish the Assyrian domination in Egypt. The inscriptions recorded a later war with Baal I due to his relations with Egypt. The king may have also refused to pay tribute. In retaliation, Ashurbanipal blockaded the harbor of Tyre until Baal I surrendered. Ashurbanipal's account of the siege stated: > [Because] he did not honor my royal commands and did not obey the > pronouncements from my lips, I set up blockades against him. To prevent his > people from leaving, I reinforced its garrison. By sea and dry land, I took > control of all of his routes and thus cut off all access to him. Baal I sent his son Yehawmelek to Ashurbanipal (r. 668‚Äì627 BC) with heavy tribute. According to Ashurbanipal's own account, Baal's son was later sent back as an act of mercy. Baal also enjoyed special rights and privileges even on the mainland, which some scholars suggested may have required a new treaty.

Featuring primarily creator-owned comics, Caliber published over 1,300 comics in the decade following its inception and is ranked as one of America's leading independent publishers. Caliber ceased publishing in 2000, but resumed operations in 2015, and continued after Reed died in 2016. HistoryBeginnings= Gary Reed, who previously owned a chain of bookstores, began publishing with the release of two titles acquired from Arrow Comics‚ÄîDeadworld and The Realm. Other initial launches included Caliber Presents, featuring the work of Vince Locke, Mark Bloodworth, Tim Vigil, James O'Barr, and Guy Davis; the first issue of Baker Street, co-created by Reed and Guy Davis; and the initial appearance of O‚ÄôBarr‚Äôs The Crow. =Expansion= Reed arranged with \\"Pocket Classics\\", a series of illustrated books similar in design to Classics Illustrated, to be released to the direct market via Caliber Press. Over forty titles were distributed. The interest in literary works continued for Caliber when in 1991 the new imprint Tome Press was launched. Tome featured historical and biographical material in addition to literature. Over 65 different Tome Press titles would be released on subjects as diverse as the Russian Revolution, The Alamo, Amelia Earhart, El Cid, Jack London stories, reprints of classic art print series, and dozens of others. After its initial launch, Caliber expanded by bringing in new creators and projects. Jim Calafiore was first published with his graphic novella, Progeny. In Grafik Muzik, Mike Allred introduced his Madman character, Kevin VanHook's Frost series which was the storyline for the film released in 2002, Ted Slampyak's Jazz Age Chronicles, Philip Hester's Fringe, Stuart Immonen's Playground, John Bergin's Ashes, and other titles such as Go-Man, Northguard, Varcel's Vixens, and more. In the early 1990s, Caliber launched three new imprints, Gauntlet and Iconografix. Gauntlet was an action-based line whose leading titles were U.N. Force, Berzerker (featuring work from Rob Liefeld and Angel Medina), Patrick Zircher's Samurai Seven, and Serpent Rising (based on the stage play). Iconografix dealt with more obscure and cutting-edge material that included humor comics as well as comics often referred to as the \\"slice of life.\\" Included here were the first issues of Ed Brubaker's Lowlife, Meatcake from Dame Darcy, Bound & Gagged from Michael Aushenker, and a number of projects from Dave Cooper, Jason Lutes, and Matt Howarth. Caliber had ventured into licensed comics with their early release of Moontrap, the science fiction film starring Star Trek's Walter Koenig, and the production of a comic for Troma Films called Frostbiter: Wrath of the Wendigo; but it was the full-color adaptation of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, written and drawn by Kevin VanHook that proved the most successful. Another licensed property was Mechanoid Invasion, a 1981 RPG from Palladium Books made into a 3-book comic called The Mechanoids beginning in Spring 1991. Another comic property affiliated with Caliber called Justice Machine had also been adapted into a Heroes Unlimited sourcebook by Palladium. This was based on the original Noble Comics version by Gustovich in 1981, while Caliber distributed the New Justice Machine sequel by Ellis from 1989. The expansion of Caliber continued with projects including Michael Lark's Airwaves, Silencers from Mark Askwith and R. G. Taylor, and Negative Burn, the anthology title that would run for 50 issues and was picked up by Desperado Publishing. =Stabur merger and further expansion= In late 1993, Caliber merged with the Stabur Corporation.\\"Caliber Merges with Stabur,\\" The Comics Journal #163 (November 1993), p. 30. Reed became president of Stabur as well as staying on with Caliber. Caliber began to produce special comics for Wal-Mart, including the series Big Bang Comics (which later would have a long run at Image Comics), Stormquest, and a number of literary adaptations, including a version of Frankenstein. Caliber also produced some records and a specialty magazine, ARC, for distribution outside comics. In 1993, the principles of Stabur were involved in starting up a new toy company with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane. Reed was named vice president of McFarlane Toys while still running Stabur and Caliber. Jim Pruett was hired to take over some of the editorial duties of Caliber. Reed would stay with McFarlane Toys until May 1996. Caliber expanded in the mid-1990s with titles such as David Mack's Kabuki, Brian Bendis' A.K.A. Goldfish and Jinx, Mark Ricketts' Nowheresville, Mike Carey and Michael Gaydos on Inferno, and in 1995, Caliber launched the sub-imprint of New Worlds. New Worlds' titles were loosely connected, and included Raven Chronicles, Helsing, Seeker, Saint Germaine, Red Diaries, Black Mist, and others. Although not an actual shared universe, the settings and characters could cross over with each other and often did. As Caliber expanded, more editorial staff was hired to handle the growing line of comics. Moebius Comics launched and fan favorites Mr. Monster and Maze Agency returned. Caliber handled the distribution of Amazing Comics, which featured the work of Mike Deodato. Brian Lumley's Necroscope and Whitley Strieber's Communion series were signed on for comic releases. Jon Sable from Mike Grell was announced but never came out. Caliber also started a new imprint in 1997, Tapestry Comics, that featured an \\"all ages\\" approach. =Decline and demise= As the overall comic market declined with the consolidation of the distribution system, Caliber slowly cut back on the number of titles. Caliber found some success of producing comics that appealed outside the usual comics market with some of the Tome Press titles including the Sherlock Holmes Reader, which had the majority of its sales outside the traditional comic stores. The demise of Caliber can be attributed primarily to the problems associated with the Spawn PowerCardz game. Caliber had invested heavily in time and money to launch the collectible card game and had great potential with purchase orders. However, the printer of the card game was running behind in production and outsourced the collation of the game to another printer who didn't understand the random assortment of the cards. When the game appeared with improper collation, the purchase orders, which exceeded over two million dollars, were cancelled. Although a lawsuit was filed and Caliber won, by the time the judgment came, it was too late. In addition, the printer declared bankruptcy and Caliber was left only with portions of the unusable product. In 2000, Caliber released the last of its titles, and Gary Reed moved on to concentrate on teaching college biology and freelance writing. Many of Caliber's top titles continued on with new publishers, including Baker Street, Deadworld, Saint Germaine, Kilroy Is Here, Negative Burn, Raven Chronicles, and Red Diaries. Reed had been reviving many of the Caliber titles with reprints of collections and all new series, initially from Image Comics, then from Desperado Publishing and Transfuzion Publishing.Home page for Transfuzion Publishing Deadworld continued to be printed in new volumes via Desperado but now under the IDW banner. = Relaunch and death of Gary Reed = In 2015, Gary Reed undertook a relaunch of Caliber, and solicited orders in the summer of 2016 for several new and reprint publications; however, he died suddenly in October 2016. Caliber has continued publishing, as of 2018, with graphic novels and comics such as Weirdsdale, Knights of the Skull, 'Nightlinger, ‚ÄúThe Shepherd‚Äù, and ‚ÄúInfinite‚Äù. Selected titles * A.K.A.

It was founded by D'Andrea (Danny) Bennett and Daegal (Dae) Bennett, both sons of legendary singer Tony Bennett; they comprised the rhythm section. Other members included Curtis Fried, Gordon Javna, Jon Yaffee, and guitarist/violinist David Mansfield. The band had a modest local following in northern New Jersey and was the opening act for Gram Parsons at Max's Kansas City in New York. Their music was oriented towards lighthearted, catchy songs. The group's name evoked, as People magazine commented, \\"a line of bathtub toys\\".http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064236,00.html People Magazine - Quacky Duck‚Äîa Hot New Group from the Suburbs The band was signed by Warner Bros. Records for $75,000 and released the album Media Push in 1974. The single \\"The Barnyard Song\\" received a smattering of airplay on WNEW-FM and the band had a national television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. Nevertheless, they failed to gain a substantial audience and were dropped by Warner Bros. Mansfield went on to a very successful career with Bob Dylan, The Alpha Band, and as a session musician and composer. The failure of Quacky Duck helped convince Danny Bennett that his talents lay more in business than in being a musician; as a result he later became Tony Bennett's manager and played a key role in resurrecting his father's commercial career in the 1980s and early 1990s. Dae Bennett went on to become a recording engineer. Gordon Javna became a writer and editor and oversees the popular Uncle John's Bathroom Reader series of trivia books.
