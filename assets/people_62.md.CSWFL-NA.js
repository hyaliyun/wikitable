The Covid Watch founders became concerned about emerging, mass surveillance-enabling digital contact tracing technology and started the project to help preserve civil liberties during the pandemic. Covid Watch started as an independent research collaboration between Stanford University and the University of Waterloo, and was the first team in the world to publish a white paper, develop, and open source a fully anonymous Bluetooth exposure alert protocol - the CEN Protocol, later renamed the TCN Protocol - in collaboration with CoEpi in early March 2020. This was followed by the rapid development of very similar decentralized protocols in early April 2020 like DP-3T, PACT, and Google/Apple Exposure Notification. The Covid Watch team now has over 200 active volunteers from around the world including advisers in public health, epidemiology, privacy, policy, and law from universities like Stanford, Waterloo, UW, UCSF, and Berkeley. Covid Watch also built a fully open source mobile app for sending anonymous exposure alerts first using the TCN Protocol in April 2020 and later using the nearly identical Google/Apple exposure notification (GAEN) framework when the GAEN APIs were released in May 2020. Also in May 2020, Covid Watch launched the first calibration and beta testing pilot of the GAEN APIs in the United States at the University of Arizona. In Aug 2020, the app launched publicly for a phased roll-out in the state of Arizona.  History  As the pandemic began its outbreak in North America, on February 19, 2020, Stanford University PhD candidate and DOE CSGF Fellow Tina White made a public Effective Altruism (EA) forum post about researching smartphone technology like GPS to alert people privately of COVID-19 exposure. This post got the attention of James Petrie at University of Waterloo who had started writing an academic paper on Overleaf on February 7, 2020 exploring private, decentralized methods using MAC addresses. The two researchers began the research collaboration between Stanford and Waterloo, which formed into the nonprofit Covid Watch. Anonymous, decentralized Bluetooth exposure alerts first publicly appeared on March 2, 2020 when CW's James Petrie posted a PDF describing the privacy model in CW public slack channels, shared with researchers and collaborators worldwide. Covid Watch's description of the technology and procedure for anonymous exposure alerts was shared widely on social media and on the original Covid Watch blog written by Rhys Fenwick. On March 10, 2020, Tina White reached out to Apple engineers to describe BLE anonymous contact tracing technology and background issues on iOS. A description of the CEN Protocol: the first anonymous, decentralized Bluetooth exposure notification protocol to be published online in Covid Watch's whitepaper on 20 March 2020 and open sourced on the Covid Watch github 17 March 2020. Covid Watch developer Zsombor Szabo built the first open source, decentralized, anonymous exposure alert protocol called the CEN Protocol. On March 12, 2020, Zsombor Szabo pushed his first commit to GitHub, laying the foundations of the CW app, completing a proof of concept on March 17 and sharing the video of the working technology on YouTube. Finally, on March 20, 2020, the CW team released a White Paper describing the CEN / TCN protocol online, sent it to Apple, and shared it among researchers worldwide. Covid Watch founder and Stanford PhD Candidate Tina White presented the technology at Stanford HAI's COVID-19 and AI virtual conference on April 1. After that, Covid Watch began receiving significant news coverage. Covid Watch then helped other groups like the TCN Coalition and MIT SafePaths implement the TCN Protocol within their open source projects to further the development of decentralized technology and foster global interoperability of contact tracing and exposure alerting apps, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption. In the same week in early April, three other teams publish decentralized, anonymous Bluetooth protocols. On April 3, 2020, the first DP^3T white paper commit is published along with its first commit on Github. On April 6, Henry de Valence of the Zcash Foundation publishes a comparison of CEN/TCN with the new white paper proposal from DP^3T. On April 9, 2020 the MIT PACT protocol spec authored by Rob Rivest, Ramesh Raskar, Vanessa Teague, and many more cited CW and DP^3T and Nicky Case published a comic describing how the CW and DP^3T Protocols work. Finally, after CW and CoEpi published their reference implementation CEN (TCN) protocol and along with several other teams communicated to Apple the issues they faced regarding a successful exposure notification app, Apple and Google announced their contact tracing API on April 10, 2020. On April 28, 2020 CW implemented the TCN protocol in a fully functional anonymous exposure alert app with Android bridging, first available in Apple TestFlight via the Stanford App Store. In May 2020, Covid Watch launched the first calibration and beta testing pilot of the GAEN protocol in the United States at the University of Arizona.

Different types of polymorphism have been identified and are listed separately.  General  Chromosomal polymorphism = In 1973, M. J. D. White, then at the end of a long career investigating karyotypes, gave an interesting summary of the distribution of chromosome polymorphism. :\\"It is extremely difficult to get an adequate idea as to what fraction of the species of eukaryote organisms actually are polymorphic for structural rearrangements of the chromosomes. In Dipterous flies with polytene chromosomes... the figure is somewhere between 60 and 80 percent... In grasshoppers pericentric inversion polymorphism is shown by only a small number of species. But in this group polymorphism for super-numerary chromosomes and chromosome regions is very strongly developed in many species.\\" :\\"It is clear that the nature of natural populations is a very complicated subject, and it now appears probable that adaptation of the various genotypes to different ecological niches and frequency-dependent selection are at least as important, and probably more important in many cases, than simple heterosis (in the sense of increased viability or fecundity of the heterozygote)\\".White M.J.D. 1973. The chromosomes. Chapman & Hall, London. 6th ed, p166-7. This suggests, once again, that polymorphism is a common and important aspect of adaptive evolution in natural populations. = Sexual dimorphism = A female (left) and a male (right) mallard (A. platyrhynchos). Like many other species of birds, mallards display striking sexual dimorphism. Most eukaryotes species use sexual reproduction, the division into two sexes is a dimorphism. The question of evolution of sex from asexual reproduction has engaged the attentions of biologists such as Charles Darwin, August Weismann, Ronald Fisher, George C. Williams, John Maynard Smith and W. D. Hamilton, with varied success. Of the many issues involved, there is widespread agreement on the following: the advantage of sexual and hermaphroditic reproduction over asexual reproduction lies in the way recombination increases the genetic diversity of the ensuing population.Smith, John Maynard. 1998. Evolutionary Genetics (2nd ed.). Oxford: Oxford U. Pr.p234Gillespie J.G. 2004. Population genetics: a concise guide. 2nd ed, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore.ch7  Humans  Human blood groups = All the common blood types, such as the ABO blood group system, are genetic polymorphisms. Here we see a system where there are more than two morphs: the phenotypes A, B, AB and O are present in all human populations, but vary in proportion in different parts of the world. The phenotypes are controlled by multiple alleles at one locus. These polymorphisms are seemingly never eliminated by natural selection; the reason came from a study of disease statistics. Statistical research has shown that an individual of a given phenotype will generally be, compared to an individual of a differing phenotype, more resistant to certain diseases while less resistant to others. For example, an individual's susceptibility to cholera (and other diarrheal infections) is correlated with their blood type: those with type O blood are the most susceptible, while those with type AB are the most resistant. Between these two extremes are the A and B blood types, with type A being more resistant than type B. This suggests that the pleiotropic effects of the genes set up opposing selective forces, thus maintaining a balance.Clarke, Cyril A. 1964. Genetics for the Clinician. Oxford: BlackwellCrow, J. 1993. \\"Felix Bernstein and the first human marker locus\\". Genetics 133 1, 4-7Meade, S. M.; Earickson, R. J. 2005. Medical Geography. Guilford. Geographical distribution of blood groups (the differences in gene frequency between populations) is broadly consistent with the classification of \\"races\\" developed by early anthropologists on the basis of visible features.Dobzhansky, Theodosius. 1970. Genetics of the Evolutionary Process. New York: Columbia U. Pr. = Sickle- cell anaemia = Sickle-cell anaemia is found mostly in tropical populations in Africa and India. An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin, HgbS, has a short expectancy of life, whereas the life expectancy of the standard hemoglobin (HgbA) homozygote and also the heterozygote is normal (though heterozygote individuals will suffer periodic problems). The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the heterozygote is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills a huge number of people each year. This is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism, balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time. Because the heterozygote survives, so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate.Ford, E. B. 1973 (1942). Genetics for Medical Students (7th ed.). London: Chapman & Hall. = Duffy system = The Duffy antigen is a protein located on the surface of red blood cells, encoded by the FY (DARC) gene. The protein encoded by this gene is a non-specific receptor for several chemokines, and is the known entry-point for the human malarial parasites Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium knowlesi. Polymorphisms in this gene are the basis of the Duffy blood group system. In humans, a mutant variant at a single site in the FY cis-regulatory region abolishes all expression of the gene in erythrocyte precursors. As a result, homozygous mutants are strongly protected from infection by P. vivax, and a lower level of protection is conferred on heterozygotes. The variant has apparently arisen twice in geographically distinct human populations, in Africa and Papua New Guinea. It has been driven to high frequencies on at least two haplotypic backgrounds within Africa. Recent work indicates a similar, but not identical, pattern exists in baboons (Papio cynocephalus), which suffer a mosquito-carried malaria-like pathogen, Hepatocystis kochi. Researchers interpret this as a case of convergent evolution. = G6PD = Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase human polymorphism is also implicated in malarial resistance. G6PD alleles with reduced activity are maintained at a high level in endemic malarial regions, despite reduced general viability. Variant A (with 85% activity) reaches 40% in sub-Saharan Africa, but is generally less than 1% outside Africa and the Middle East. = Human taste morphisms = A famous puzzle in human genetics is the genetic ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide (phenylthiourea or PTC), a morphism which was discovered in 1931. This substance, which is bitter to some people and tasteless to others, is of no great significance in itself, yet it is a genetic dimorphism. Because of its high frequency (which varies in different ethnic groups) it must be connected to some function of selective value. The ability to taste PTC itself is correlated with the ability to taste other bitter substances, many of which are toxic. Indeed, PTC itself is toxic, though not at the level of tasting it on litmus. Variation in PTC perception may reflect variation in dietary preferences throughout human evolution, and might correlate with susceptibility to diet-related diseases in modern populations. There is a statistical correlation between PTC tasting and liability to thyroid disease. Fisher, Ford and Huxley tested orangutans and chimpanzees for PTC perception with positive results, thus demonstrating the long-standing existence of this dimorphism. The PTC gene, which accounts for 85% of the tasting variance, has now been analysed for sequence variation with results which suggest selection is maintaining the morphism. = MHC molecules = The genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are highly polymorphic, and this diversity plays a very important role in resistance to pathogens. This is true for other species as well.  Amphibians  Mid- dorsal stripe in frogs = Some frog species display polymorphism by presence/absence of a light stripe going along the central part of their back. A light mid-dorsal stripe has been shown to be determined by a simple dominant gene in Rana limnocharis, Rana ridibunda, Rana sylvatica and Rana arvalis;SHCHUPAK, E. L. & ISHCHENKO, V. G., 1981. On the hereditary base of colour polymorphism in moor frog (Rana arvalis Nilss). I. Light mid-dorsal stripe. In: Herpetological researches in Siberia and Far East, Leningrad, Nauka: 128-132. [In Russian] that means the individuals both homozygtes by allele determining the presence of stripe and heterozygotes have the stripe, whereas only the individuals homozygotic by recessive allele are non-striped. The proportions of striped specimens in populations of some frogs show clinal variations. For example, the proportion of striped Rana sylvatica in North America generally increases towards the west and north. The variations in the proportion of different color may relate to either genetic-stochastic processes. or their adaptive importance.MERRELL, D. J.,1969. Limits on heterozygous advantage as an explanation of poymorphism. J . Hered, 60: 180-182ISHCHENKO, V. G., 1978. Dinamicheskij polimorfizm burikh lyagushek fauni SSSR. [Dynamic polymorphism of the brown frogs of USSR fauna]. Moscow, Nauka: 1-148. [In Russian] For different colour morphs of Acris crepitans, the hypothesis about the direct adaptive value of different colour morphs (for escaping predation) competes with the hypothesis that these morphs correlate with thermotolerance. Striped specimens Rana sylvatica, striped specimens better perform in open areas. Differences in the proportion of striped frogs in Rana arvalis are explained with physiological differences between the morphs. Striped recently metamorphosed frogs have a relatively large liver, in comparison with unstriped ones, and their weight increases more rapidly. Tadpoles of striped Rana arvalis need more time for completing metamorphosis but, after metamorphosis, their growth is faster than that of unstriped froglets. In a frog widespread in Turkey and the Caucasus, Rana macrocnemis, the proportion of frogs with the stripe increases with the altitude in mountains of the Lesser Caucasus, but not in the Greater Caucasus. Given the same altitude, non-striped frogs from the Greater Caucasus grow slower and maturate later than the striped frogs from the Lesser Caucasus, which provides them selective advantage in high mountains, but their tadpoles are likely to be less resistant to overheating than those of the non-striped frogs.Tarkhnishvili, D. N., 1996. Genetic relationships in local populations of brown frogs ‚Äì analysis of distribution of a character under selection. In: Population Genetic Group, 30th annual meeting, University of Edinburgh, 17-20 Dec. 1996, Paper Abstr., p.42  Birds  Cuckoo = Reed warbler feeding a cuckoo chick (Cuculus canorus) Over fifty species in this family of birds practice brood parasitism; the details are best seen in the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus). In a season the female lays one egg in 15‚Äì20 other bird nests. She removes some or all of the host's clutch of eggs, and lays an egg which closely matches the host eggs. In Britain the cuckoo lays small eggs that match the size of the smaller host's. The eggs are thick-shelled as a defense to protect the egg if the host detects the fraud. The intruded egg develops exceptionally quickly; when the newly hatched cuckoo is only ten hours old, and still blind, it exhibits an urge to eject the other eggs or nestlings. It rolls them into a special depression on its back and heaves them out of the nest. The cuckoo nestling is apparently able to pressure the host adults for feeding by mimicking the cries of the host nestlings. The diversity of the cuckoo's eggs is extraordinary, the forms resembling those of its most usual hosts. In Britain these are: * Meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis): brown eggs speckled with darker brown. * European robin (Erithacus rubecula): whitish-grey eggs speckled with bright red. * Reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpensis): light dull green eggs blotched with olive. * Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus): clear blue eggs. * Hedge sparrow (Prunella modularis): clear blue eggs, unmarked, not mimicked. This bird is an uncritical fosterer; it tolerates in its nest eggs that do not resemble its own. Each female cuckoo lays one type only; the same type laid by her mother. In this way female cuckoos are divided into groups (known as gentes, singular gens), each parasitises the host to which it is adapted. The male cuckoo has its own territory, and mates with females from any gens; thus the population (all gentes) is interbreeding. The standard explanation of how the inheritance of gens works is as follows. The egg colour is inherited by sex chromosome. In birds sex determination is ZZ/ZW, and unlike mammals, the heterogametic sex is the female. The determining gene (or super-gene) for the inheritance of egg colour is believed to be carried on the W chromosome, which is directly transmitted in the female line. The female behaviour in choosing the host species is set by imprinting after birth, a common mechanism in bird behaviour.Ford, E. B. 1975. Ecological Genetics (4th ed.). London: Chapman & HallFord, E.B. 1981. Taking Genetics into the Countryside. London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson. Ecologically, the system of multiple hosts protects host species from a critical reduction in numbers, and maximises the egg-laying capacity of the population of cuckoos. It also extends the range of habitats where the cuckoo eggs may be raised successfully. Detailed work on the cuckoo started with E. Chance in 1922,Chance E. 1922. The Cuckoo's Secret. London. and continues to the present day; in particular, the inheritance of gens is still a live issue. = Darwin's finches = Whereas Darwin spent just five weeks in the Gal√°pagos, and David Lack spent three months, Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues have made research trips to the Gal√°pagos for about thirty years, particularly studying Darwin's finches. The Espa√±ola cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris) lives on Isla Genovesa (formerly Tower Island) which is formed from a shield volcano, and is home to a variety of birds. These birds, like all well-studied groups,Huxley, Julian S. 1954 (presentation; printed 1955). \\"Morphism in Birds\\". 11th Int. Ornith. Cong., pp. 309‚Äì328. Basel. show various kinds of morphism. Males are dimorphic in song type: songs A and B are quite distinct. Also, males with song A have shorter bills than B males. This is also a clear difference. With these beaks males are able to feed differently on their favourite cactus, the prickly pear Opuntia. Those with long beaks are able to punch holes in the cactus fruit and eat the fleshy aril pulp which surrounds the seeds, whereas those with shorter beaks tear apart the cactus base and eat the pulp and any insect larvae and pupae (both groups eat flowers and buds). This dimorphism clearly maximises their feeding opportunities during the non-breeding season when food is scarce. Territories of type A and type B males are random if not mated but alternate if mated: no two breeding males of the same song type shared a common boundary. This initially suggested the possibility of assortative mating by female choice.Grant, Peter R.; Grant, B. Rosemary. 1989. \\"Sympatric Speciation and Darwin's Finches\\". In D. Otte & J. A. Endler (eds.) Speciation and its consequences. Sinauer. However, further work showed that \\"the choice of a male by a female is independent of any conditioning influence of her father's song type and there is no evidence of assortative mating by bill type... Hence there is no direct evidence of reproductive subdivision in the population\\".Grant, B. Rosemary; Grant, Peter R. 1989. Evolutionary Dynamics of a Natural Population: The Large Cactus Finch of the Gal√°pagos, p. 241. Chicago: Chicago U. Pr. In 1999 Peter Grant agreed that \\"sympatric speciation [in this example] is unlikely to occur\\".Grant, Peter R. 1999. Ecology and Evolution of Darwin's Finches. Princeton: Princeton U. Pr. If the population is panmixic, then Geospiza conirostris exhibits a balanced genetic polymorphism and not, as originally supposed, a case of nascent sympatric speciation. The selection maintaining the polymorphism maximises the species' niche by expanding its feeding opportunity. The genetics of this situation cannot be clarified in the absence of a detailed breeding program, but two loci with linkage disequilibrium is a possibility. Another interesting dimorphism is for the bills of young finches, which are either \\"pink\\" or \\"yellow\\". All species of Darwin's finches exhibit this morphism, which lasts for two months. No interpretation of this phenomenon is known. = White- throated sparrows = The white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), a passerine bird of the American sparrow family Passerellidae, shows a clear dimorphism in both sexes throughout its large range. Their heads are either white-striped or tan-striped. These differences in plumage result from a balanced chromosomal inversion polymorphism; in white-striped (WS) birds, one copy of chromosome 2 is partly inverted, while in tan-striped (TS) birds, both copies are uninverted. The plumage differences are paralleled by differences in behavior and breeding strategy. WS males sing more, are more aggressive and more frequently engage in extra-pair copulation than their TS counterparts. TS birds of both sexes provide more parental care than WS birds. The polymorphism is maintained by negative assortative mating‚Äîeach morph mates with its opposite. Dimorphic pairs may have an advantageous balance between parental care and aggressive territorial defense. In addition, as in many other polymorphisms, heterozygote advantage seems to help maintain this one; the proportion of WS birds homozygotic for the inversion is even lower than would be expected from the low frequency (4%) of pairings of the same morph.Falls J.B. and J.G. Kopachena. 2010. White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis). ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Birds of North America Online‚Äô‚Äô (ed A. Poole) Ithaca: Cornell Lab of Ornithology; Retrieved from the Birds of North America Online: In the underlying chromosomal polymorphism, the standard (ZAL2) and alternative (ZAL2m) arrangements differ by a pair of included pericentric inversions at least. ZAL2m suppresses recombination in the heterokaryotype and is evolving as a rare nonrecombining autosomal segment of the genome.  Fish  Arctic char = Arctic char are notable for exhibiting numerous, seemingly distinct morphological variants or morphs throughout the range of the species.Malmquist, H. J., Snorrason, S. S., Skulason, S., Jonsson, B., Sandlund, O. T., & Jonasson, P. M. (1992). Diet differentiation in polymorphic Arctic charr in Thingvallavatn, Iceland. Journal of Animal Ecology, 21-35. Consequently, Arctic charr have been referred to as the 'most variable vertebrate on Earth'. These morphs are often sympatric within lakes or rivers. Morphs often vary significantly in size, shape and colour. Morphs often demonstrate differences in migratory behaviour, being resident or anadromous fish, and in feeding behaviour and niche placement. Morphs often interbreed, but they can also be reproductively isolated and represent genetically distinct populations, which have been cited as examples of incipient speciation.  Insects  Ants = Ants exhibit a range of polymorphisms. First, there is their characteristic haplodiploid sex determination system, whereby all males are haploid, and all females diploid. Second, there is differentiation between both the females and males based mostly on feeding of larvae, which determines, for example, whether the imago is capable of reproduction. Lastly, there is differentiation of size and 'duties' (particularly of females), which are usually controlled by feeding and/or age, but which may sometimes be genetically controlled. Thus the order exhibits both genetic polymorphism and extensive polyphenism. = Chromosome polymorphism in Drosophila = In the 1930s Dobzhansky and his co-workers collected Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis from wild populations in California and neighbouring states. Using Painter's technique they studied the polytene chromosomes and discovered that the wild populations were polymorphic for chromosomal inversions. All the flies look alike whatever inversions they carry: this is an example of a cryptic polymorphism. Accordingly, Dobzhansky favoured the idea that the morphs became fixed in the population by means of Sewall Wright's drift.Dobzhansky, Theodosius. 1937. Genetics and the Origin of Species (1st ed.). New York: Columbia U. Pr. However, evidence rapidly accumulated to show that natural selection was responsible: Drosophila polytene chromosome 1\\\\. Values for heterozygote inversions of the third chromosome were often much higher than they should be under the null assumption: if no advantage for any form the number of heterozygotes should conform to Ns (number in sample) = p2+2pq+q2 where 2pq is the number of heterozygotes (see Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium). 2\\\\. Using a method invented by l'Heretier and Teissier, Dobzhansky bred populations in population cages, which enabled feeding, breeding and sampling whilst preventing escape. This had the benefit of eliminating migration as a possible explanation of the results. Stocks containing inversions at a known initial frequency can be maintained in controlled conditions. It was found that the various chromosome types do not fluctuate at random, as they would if selectively neutral, but adjust to certain frequencies at which they become stabilised. With D. persimilis he found that the caged population followed the values expected on the Hardy‚ÄìWeinberg equilibrium when conditions were optimal (which disproved any idea of non-random mating), but with a restricted food supply heterozygotes had a distinct advantage. 3\\\\. Different proportions of chromosome morphs were found in different areas. There is, for example, a polymorph-ratio cline in D. robusta along an transect near Gatlinburg, TN passing from to 4,000 feet. Also, the same areas sampled at different times of year yielded significant differences in the proportions of forms. This indicates a regular cycle of changes which adjust the population to the seasonal conditions. For these results selection is by far the most likely explanation. 4\\\\. Lastly, morphs cannot be maintained at the high levels found simply by mutation, nor is drift a possible explanation when population numbers are high. By the time Dobzhansky published the third edition of his book in 1951, he was persuaded that the chromosome morphs were being maintained in the population by the selective advantage of the heterozygotes, as with most polymorphisms. Later he made yet another interesting discovery. One of the inversions, known as PP, was quite rare up to 1946, but by 1958 its proportion had risen to 8%. Not only that, but the proportion was similar over an area of some in California. This cannot have happened by migration of PP morphs from, say, Mexico (where the inversion is common) because the rate of dispersal (at less than 2 km/year) is of the wrong order. The change therefore reflected a change in prevailing selection whose basis was not yet known.Dobzhansky, Theodosius. 1981. Dobzhansky's Genetics of Natural Populations. Lewontin, R. C.; Moore, J. A.; Provine, W. B.; Wallace, B. (eds.). New York: Columbia U. P. = Hoverfly polymorphism = Hoverfly mimics can be seen in almost any garden in the temperate zone. The Syrphidae are a large (5600+ species) family of flies; their imagoes feed on nectar and pollen, and are well known for their mimicry of social hymenoptera. The mimicry is Batesian in nature: hoverflies are palatable but hymenoptera are generally unpalatable and may also be protected by stingers and/or armour. Many social wasp (Vespidae) species exhibit M√ºllerian mimicry, where a group of unpalatable species benefit from sharing the same kind of warning (aposematic) colouration. Wasps are decidedly noxious: nasty-tasting and with a painful sting. They form a Mullerian 'ring' of similarly coloured models; the wasps are often accompanied by clusters of hover-fly mimics, who tend to arrive at the flowers at a similar time of day, and whose flight pattern is passably similar to wasp flight. Observers in a garden can see for themselves that hoverfly mimics are quite common, usually many times more common than the models, and are (to our sight) relatively poor mimics, often easy to distinguish from real wasps. However, it has been established in other cases that imperfect mimicry can confer significant advantage to the mimic, especially if the model is really noxious.Brower, L.P. 1988. Mimicry and the evolutionary process. Chicago. Also, not only is polymorphism absent from these mimics, it is absent in the wasps also: these facts are presumably connected. The situation with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, in the sense of being difficult to eat: their body is covered with setae (like carpet pile) and is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: with the exception of specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees presented to them. After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill and eat a bumblebee. Bumblebees form Mullerian rings of species, and they do often exhibit polymorphism. The hoverfly species mimicking bumblebees are generally accurate mimics, and many of their species are polymorphic. Many of the polymorphisms are different between the sexes, for example by the mimicry being limited to one sex only. The question is, how can the differences between social wasp mimics and bumblebee mimics be explained? Evidently if model species are common, and have overlapping distributions, they are less likely to be polymorphic. Their mimics are widespread and develop a kind of rough and ready jack-of-all-trades mimicry. But if model species are less common and have patchy distribution they develop polymorphism; and their mimics match them more exactly and are polymorphic also. The issues are currently being investigated. = Peppered moth = The peppered moth, Biston betularia, is justly famous as an example of a population responding in a heritable way to a significant change in their ecological circumstances. E.B. Ford described peppered moth evolution as \\"one of the most striking, though not the most profound, evolutionary changes ever actually witnessed in nature\\".Ford, E.B. 1976. Genetics and Adaptation, p14. London: Arnold. Although the moths are cryptically camouflaged and rest during the day in unexposed positions on trees, they are predated by birds hunting by sight. The original camouflage (or crypsis) seems near-perfect against a background of lichen growing on trees. The sudden growth of industrial pollution in the nineteenth century changed the effectiveness of the moths' camouflage: the trees became blackened by soot, and the lichen died off. In 1848 a dark version of this moth was found in the Manchester area. By 1895 98% of the peppered moths in this area were black. This was a rapid change for a species that has only one generation a year. In Europe, there are three morphs: the typical white morph (betularia or typica), and carbonaria, the melanic black morph. They are controlled by alleles at one locus, with the carbonaria being dominant. There is also an intermediate or semi-melanic morph insularia, controlled by other alleles.Majerus, Michael. 1998. Melanism: Evolution in Action. Oxford: Blackwell. A key fact, not realised initially, is the advantage of the heterozygotes, which survive better than either of the homozygotes. This affects the caterpillars as well as the moths, in spite of the caterpillars being monomorphic in appearance (they are twig mimics). In practice heterozygote advantage puts a limit to the effect of selection, since neither homozygote can reach 100% of the population. For this reason, it is likely that the carbonaria allele was in the population originally, pre- industrialisation, at a low level. With the recent reduction in pollution, the balance between the forms has already shifted back significantly. Another interesting feature is that the carbonaria had noticeably darkened after about a century. This was seen quite clearly when specimens collected about 1880 were compared with specimens collected more recently: clearly the dark morph has been adjusted by the strong selection acting on the gene complex. This might happen if a more extreme allele was available at the same locus; or genes at other loci might act as modifiers. We do not, of course, know anything about the genetics of the original melanics from the nineteenth century. This type of industrial melanism has only affected such moths as obtain protection from insect-eating birds by resting on trees where they are concealed by an accurate resemblance to their background (over 100 species of moth in Britain with melanic forms were known by 1980). No species which hide during the day, for instance, among dead leaves, is affected, nor has the melanic change been observed among butterflies.Ford, E. B. 1965. \\"Heterozygous Advantage\\". In Genetic Polymorphism. Boston/London.: MIT Pr./Faber & FaberKettlewell H.B.D. 1973. The Evolution of Melanism. Oxford: Oxford U. Pr. This is, as shown in many textbooks, \\"evolution in action\\". Much of the early work was done by Bernard Kettlewell, whose methods came under scrutiny later on. The entomologist Michael Majerus discussed criticisms made of Kettlewell's experimental methods in his 1998 book Melanism: Evolution in Action.Majerus M.E.N. 2004. The Peppered Moth: Decline of a Darwinian Disciple. Microsoft Word.doc format. This book was misrepresented in some reviews, and the story picked up by creationist campaigners. Judith Hooper, in her controversial book Of Moths and Men (2002), implied that Kettlewell's work was fraudulent or incompetent. Careful studies of Kettlewell's surviving papers by Rudge (2005) and Young (2004) found that Hooper's accusation of fraud was unjustified, and that \\"Hooper does not provide one shred of evidence to support this serious allegation\\".Young, M. 2003. Moonshine: Why the Peppered Moth remains an icon of evolution . Publisher:talkreason.org webpage. Majerus himself described Of Moths and Men as \\"littered with errors, misrepresentations, misinterpretations and falsehoods\\". A suitably restrained 2004 summary of opinion mostly favoured predation as the main selective force.Ruxton, G. D.; Sherratt, T. N.; Speed, M. P. 2004. Avoiding Attack: The Evolutionary Ecology of Crypsis, Warning Signals and Mimicry, pp. 9‚Äì10. Oxford: Oxford U Pr. Starting in 2000, Majerus conducted a detailed seven-year study of moths, experimenting to assess the various criticisms. He concluded that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in carbonaria frequency compared to typica in Cambridge during the study period, and described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story. He said, \\"If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution.\\" Current interpretation of the available evidence is that the peppered moth is in fact a valid example of natural selection and adaptation. It illustrates a polymorphic species maintaining adaptation to a varied and sometimes changing environment. = Two-spotted ladybird beetle = Adalia bipunctata, the two-spotted ladybird, is highly polymorphic. Its basic form is red with two black spots, but it has many other forms, the most important being melanic, with black elytra and red spots. The curious fact about this morphism is that, although the melanic forms are more common in industrial areas, its maintenance has nothing to do with cryptic camouflage and predation. The Coccinellidae as a whole are highly noxious, and experiments with birds and other predators have found this species quite exceptionally distasteful.Fraser, J. F. D.; Rothschild, M. 1960. \\"Defence Mechanisms in Warningly-coloured Moths and Other Insects\\". Proceedings of the 11th International Congress on Entomology, pp. 248‚Äì256. Therefore, their colour is warning (aposematic) colouration, and all the morphs are quite conspicuous against green vegetation. The field studies identify differing proportions of morphs at different times of year and in different places, which indicates a high level of selection. However, the basis of that selection is still not known for sure, though many theories have been proposed.Creed E.R. 1971. \\"Melanism in the Two-spot Ladybird, Adelia bipunctata, in Great Britain\\". In E. R. Creed (ed.), Ecological Genetics and Evolution. Oxford: Blackwell. Since all the morphs are aposematically coloured, it seems unlikely that the difference between the colour of morphs is directly under selection. Perhaps pleiotropic effects of the genes acting on colour also affect the beetle's physiology, and hence its relative fitness. A similar polymorphic system is found in many other species in this family: Harmonia axyridis is a good example. = Scarlet tiger moth = The scarlet tiger moth Callimorpha (Panaxia) dominula (family Arctiidae) occurs in continental Europe, western Asia and southern England. It is a day-flying moth, noxious-tasting, with brilliant warning colour in flight, but cryptic at rest. The moth is colonial in habit, and prefers marshy ground or hedgerows. The preferred food of the larvae is the herb Comfrey (Symphytum officinale). In England it has one generation per year. Callimorpha dominula morpha typica with spread wings. The red with black rear wings, revealed in flight, warn of its noxious taste. The front wings are cryptic, covering the rear wings at rest. Here the moth is resting but alert, and has jinked the front wings forward to reveal the warning flash. The moth is known to be polymorphic in its colony at Cothill, about five miles (8 km) from Oxford, with three forms: the typical homozygote; the rare homozygote (bimacula) and the heterozygote (medionigra). It was studied there by Ford and later by Sheppard and their co- workers over many years. Data is available from 1939 to the present day, got by the usual field method of capture-mark-release-recapture and by genetic analysis from breeding in captivity. The records cover gene frequency and population-size for much of the twentieth century. In this instance the genetics appears to be simple: two alleles at a single locus, producing the three phenotypes. Total captures over 26 years 1939‚Äì64 came to 15,784 homozygous dominula (i.e. typica), 1,221 heterozygous medionigra and 28 homozygous bimacula. Now, assuming equal viability of the genotypes 1,209 heterozygotes would be expected, so the field results do not suggest any heterozygous advantage. It was Sheppard who found that the polymorphism is maintained by selective mating: each genotype preferentially mates with other morphs. This is sufficient to maintain the system despite the fact that in this case the heterozygote has slightly lower viability.  Mammals  Reindeer and caribou = Genetic polymorphism of serum transferrins in reindeer is used in population and genetic studies. Gene concentrations of alleles in populations of reindeer of the North-East of Siberia were compared with those in reindeer inhabiting Norway, the northern regions of the European part of the USSR and from North American caribou. Researchers found that frequencies of Tf alleles of the Siberian reindeer differed from all the others. It is possible that resistance to necrobacteriosis is related to concentrations of alleles in certain reindeer populations.  Molluscs  Grove snail = The grove snail, Cepaea nemoralis, is famous for the rich polymorphism of its shell. The system is controlled by a series of multiple alleles. The shell colour series is brown (genetically the top dominant trait), dark pink, light pink, very pale pink, dark yellow and light yellow (the bottom or universal recessive trait). Bands may be present or absent; and if present from one to five in number. Unbanded is the top dominant trait, and the forms of banding are controlled by modifier genes (see epistasis). Grove snail, dark yellow shell with single band. In England the snail is regularly predated by the song thrush Turdus philomelos, which breaks them open on thrush anvils (large stones). Here fragments accumulate, permitting researchers to analyse the snails taken. The thrushes hunt by sight, and capture selectively those forms which match the habitat least well. Snail colonies are found in woodland, hedgerows and grassland, and the predation determines the proportion of phenotypes (morphs) found in each colony. Two active grove snails (Cepaea nemoralis) A second kind of selection also operates on the snail, whereby certain heterozygotes have a physiological advantage over the homozygotes. In addition, apostatic selection is likely, with the birds preferentially taking the most common morph. This is the 'search pattern' effect, where a predominantly visual predator persists in targeting the morph which gave a good result, even though other morphs are available. Despite the predation, the polymorphism survives in almost all habitats, though the proportions of morphs varies considerably. The alleles controlling the polymorphism form a super-gene with linkage so close as to be nearly absolute. This control saves the population from a high proportion of undesirable recombinants, and it is hypothesised that selection has brought the loci concerned together. To sum up, in this species predation by birds appears to be the main (but not the only) selective force driving the polymorphism. The snails live on heterogeneous backgrounds, and thrush are adept at detecting poor matches. The inheritance of physiological and cryptic diversity is preserved also by heterozygous advantage in the super-gene. Recent work has included the effect of shell colour on thermoregulation, and a wider selection of possible genetic influences is considered by Cook. A similar system of genetic polymorphism occurs in the white-lipped snail Cepaea hortensis, a close relative of the grove snail. In Iceland, where there are no song thrushes, a correlation has been established between temperature and colour forms. Banded and brown morphs reach higher temperatures than unbanded and yellow snails.Owen, D. 1980. Camouflage and Mimicry. Oxford: Oxford U. Pr. This may be the basis of the physiological selection found in both species of snail.  Plants  Heterostyly = Dissection of thrum and pin flowers of Primula vulgaris An example of a botanical genetic polymorphism is heterostyly, in which flowers occur in different forms with different arrangements of the pistils and the stamens. The system is called heteromorphic self-incompatibility, and the general 'strategy' of stamens separated from pistils is known as herkogamy. Pin and thrum heterostyly occurs in dimorphic species of Primula, such as P. vulgaris. There are two types of flower. The pin flower has a long style bearing the stigma at the mouth and the stamens halfway down; and the thrum flower has a short style, so the stigma is halfway up the tube and the stamens are at the mouth. So when an insect in search of nectar inserts its proboscis into a long-style flower, the pollen from the stamens stick to the proboscis in exactly the part that will later touch the stigma of the short-styled flower, and vice versa.Darwin, Charles. 1877. The different forms of flowers on plants of the same species. London: Murray. Another most important property of the heterostyly system is physiological. If thrum pollen is placed on a thrum stigma, or pin pollen on a pin stigma, the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set. Effectively, this ensures out-crossing, as described by Darwin. Quite a lot is now known about the underlying genetics; the system is controlled by a set of closely linked genes which act as a single unit, a super- gene.Sheppard, Philip M. 1975. Natural Selection and Heredity (4th ed.) London: Hutchinson. All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.Darlington C. 1958. Evolution of genetic systems, 2nd ed, p120 et seq: The genetic promotion of crossing. Oliver & Boyd, London. Between 1861 and 1863, Darwin found the same kind of structure in other groups: flax (and other species of Linum); and in purple loosestrife and other species of Lythrum. Some of the Lythrum species are trimorphic, with one style and two stamens in each form.Darwin, Charles. 1977 (collection). Barrett, P. H. (ed.), The Collected Papers of Charles Darwin. Chicago: Chicago U. Pr. Heterostyly is known in at least 51 genera of 18 families of Angiosperms.Darlington C. 1971. The evolution of polymorphic systems. In Creed R. (ed) Ecological genetics and evolution. Blackwell, Oxford.  Reptiles  Common side-blotched lizards = Male common side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana) exhibit polymorphism in their throat pigmentation, and these different phenotypes are correlated with different mating strategies. Orange-throated males are the largest and most aggressive, defending large territories and keeping harems of females. Blue-throated males are of intermediate size, and guard smaller territories containing only a single female. Yellow-throated males are the smallest, and instead of holding territories they mimic females in order to sneak matings away from the other two morphs. The balance between these three morphs is maintained by frequency-dependent selection. = Common wall lizards = The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) displays polymorphism and has six distinct morphs which vary by the colour of their throat and underbelly (underbelly colouration seen predominantly in males). There are three \\"pure\\" morphs of colours: red, yellow and white and three \\"intermediate\\" morphs which are a combination of the colours: white-red, white-yellow and red-yellow. =Ctenophorus decresii = The Ctenophorus decresii lizard displays polymorphism with varying colors of their throats. The throat colors range from white and gray to bright colors of red, orange, or blue. The diversity in throat color is due to a combination of sexual selection and natural selection. = Ctenophorus pictus = Male Ctenophorus pictus lizards display different colors. The most common are red and yellow, but colors can range from brown to orange to red/orange. These morphs are maintained in nature through a combination of selective factors: natural selection and sexual selection. = Viviparous lizards = Viviparous lizards display color polymorphism in three ventral colors: yellow, orange, and a mixture of the two. These color morphs respond to variation in density frequency-dependence within their environment.

In it, he narrates his voyage of 35 years and his missionary work.  Context  During Alexandre de Rhodes‚Äôs time, European presence in South-East Asia was rather limited. Europeans were principally there to trade, but the merchants were often accompanied by missionaries. Therefore, most travel texts about South-East Asia were produced by a relatively small number of merchants and missionaries. These texts were immensely popular during the seventeenth century, because Europeans were very curious about these foreign lands, their inhabitants and their customs. Alexandre de Rhodes‚Äôs book was published when he was working in France (namely in Marseille, Lyon and Paris) between 1652 and 1654, in order to gain support for the Christian church in Vietnam. He was asked to fulfill the three following tasks: ‚Äúto impress the Pope of the extreme need to send bishops to Tonkin and Cochinchina; to seek material help from Christian princes for the missions; and to ask the superior general to send more missionaries to the countries of Asia.‚ÄùPhan, P. C., & Rhodes, A. de. (2005). Mission and catechesis: Alexandre de Rhodes and inculturation in seventeenth- century Vietnam. Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books. At the beginning of de Rhodes‚Äôs travel narrative, the Jesuit explains that the reason why he decided to write Divers Voyages [...], was because many great people who have read his short texts about his travels, have asked him to offer the public a full version.  Contents  Divers voyages et missions du p√®re Alexandre de Rhodes de la Compagnie de J√©sus en la Chine et autres royaumes de l'Orient, avec son retour en Europe par la Perse et l‚ÄôArm√©nie is divided in three parts: Alexandre de Rhodes‚Äôs journey from Rome to China, his missions in Tonkin and Cochinchina (today‚Äôs Vietnam) and finally his return from China to Rome. The main topic of this book is de Rhodes‚Äôs proselytizing work and his methods of conversion, but he does describe some of the foreign lands, customs, and politics as well. The part about his journey in Tonkin and Cochinchina is the longest one, because he spent most of his time there. The first chapters describe Cochinchina‚Äôs and Tonkin‚Äôs historical relationship, governments, its armies, language, customs as well as its religions. De Rhodes also writes about their fertile lands, gold mines, high quantities of pepper, silk, sugar and other resources. After that, all the chapters on today‚Äôs Vietnam are mostly about his many successes and few failures in converting the natives, the government‚Äôs repression he and other Christians sometimes faced, and circumstances he portrayed as miracles. A recurring representation throughout the book is that of Vietnamese natives being highly receptive and devoted to Christianity, even risking their lives for their faith.  Publication history  This travel account was first published in 1653 by the librarian and print worker S√©bastien Cramoisy. It was republished in 1854 under the slightly different title: Les Voyages et Mission du P. Alexandre de Rhodes de la compagnie de J√©sus en la Chine et autres Royaumes de l‚ÄôOrient, by the publisher Julien, Lanier. The latter edition includes a foreword by the editor Auguste Carayonwho belonged to the Society of Jesus, as well as some definitions of archaic words in the footnotes, no other alterations have been made.  Contemporary reception  Alexandre de Rhodes‚ÄôsLes Voyages et Mission du P. Alexandre de Rhodes de la compagnie de J√©sus en la Chine et autres Royaumes de l‚ÄôOrient has been examined in an essay by Micheline Lessard. She uses discourse analysis in order to examine a few passages in the book as well as other seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Jesuit texts about Vietnam. She contends that the texts she analyses are all Orientalist. Through this argument she challenges Edwards Said‚Äôs definition of Orientalism, because according to him it developed in the eighteenth century, and not before. Moreover, in her analysis of de Rhodes‚Äôs travel narrative, Lessard has found that when the Jesuit would describe Vietnamese laws and customs, his commentary was revealing of his opinions on European society. Furthermore, she shows that the Chinese Rites Controversy affected de Rhodes‚Äôs writing as well. Due to the sensitive political climate created by the controversy, Jesuits felt the need to portray the Vietnamese in a more positive light. Alexandre de Rhodes did so by purposefully downplaying the practice of polygamy in Vietnam for instance. Finally, her comparison has shown, that de Rhodes‚Äôs representations slightly differed from the ones made by the other Jesuits. For instance, although he described Vietnamese religious customs as superstitious, he was still able to offer ‚Äúa more descriptive and analytical account‚Äù.Lessard, M. (2018). Curious Relations: Jesuit Perceptions of the Vietnamese. In K. W. Taylor & J. K. Whitmore (Eds.), Essays into Vietnamese Pasts(pp.137-156). Cornell University Press. Michael Harrigan also briefly dealt with Alexandre de Rhodes‚Äôs travel book. He included the latter in his book, where he investigates how French travel narratives represented the Orient in the seventeenth century. In the chapter about the East Indies, he identifies a few tropes which were often found in the travel accounts he analyzed (Divers Voyages [...] is among them). Similarly to Lessard, Harrigan argues that these texts have Orientalist characteristics.  Bibliography  * Harrigan, M. (2008).

Her husband was initially drawn to her spiritual openness, direct relationship with God, and periods of spiritual ecstasy. As a theological student at Yale, he had longed to have a personal relationship with God. His wife's experiences, similar to those of Saint Teresa of √Åvila, profoundly affected his religious life and the formation of the New Light. She was a model of spirituality during the Great Awakening of the early 18th century. Her experiences of religious ecstasy were documented in Jonathan Edward's work, Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival of Religion in New England. She raised her eleven children, largely by herself, as Jonathan Edwards focused on sermons and books. Among her noted descendants, Sarah was the grandmother of Vice President Aaron Burr. Early life Sarah Pierpont was born on January 9, 1710 in New Haven, Connecticut. Her parents were James Pierpont and Mary (Hooker) Pierpont, granddaughter of first-generation Puritan Thomas Hooker, who has been considered the founder of Connecticut. Her father was the minister of the First Church of New Haven, Connecticut from 1685 until his death in 1714. He also helped establish what is now Yale University. Educated at home, she was better educated than most women of her day. By the age of six, she entered her \\"heavenly Elysium\\" where she would ‚Äúbe enraptured by his [Christ's] light and love, have visions of Christ's excellence, and remain in an ecstatic state for up to six hours.\\" This was the first of her \\"seasons of grace\\" that were similar to the experiences of Saint Teresa of √Åvila. Pierpont met Jonathan Edwards, when she was 13 years of age and he was a divinity student at Yale College. She was well-educated, a good conversationalist, and a beautiful young lady. Edwards appreciated Pierpont's intelligence and valued her opinion during their discussions of religion. He was particularly interested in her personal relationship with God and the openness with which she expressed spiritual delight. Sarah's openness helped Jonathan broadened his perspective of religion from primarily an intellectual study of religion to have a personal relationship with God, for which he had longed. He wrote of his admiration for her spiritual awareness and acuity in Apostrophe to Sarah Pierpont. Marriage and children Engraving of Jonathan Edwards Sarah Pierpont married Jonathan Edwards in July 1727, becoming Sarah Edwards; Her father Rev. James Pierpont officiated at the wedding. The Edwards had eleven children, the first, Sarah, was born in August 1728; The eleventh was born in 1750. Their children were Sarah, Jerusha, Esther, Mary, Lucy, Timothy, Susannah, Eunice, Jonathan, Elizabeth, and Pierpont. Rare for the time, all of her children survived infancy, as well as lived to adulthood. The couple valued education for their sons and daughters. Jonathan spent an hour each day helping his children with their studies. He also led them in devotions each morning and night. He spent 13 hours of each day writing books on theology and preparing sermons. Sarah was the hands-on parent who raised the children and ran the household, providing an agreeable and pleasant life for her family. The children were raised to treat their parents with great reverence: stand when a parent entered the room, stop speaking when their parents spoke, and not to sit when their parents were standing. She raised her children \\"as examples of Christian simplicity\\" and was a model parent within the her husband's congregation. Sarah was hospitable, bringing visiting preachers into her home for conversation and meals. Apprentices to Jonathan were treated like members of the family. She had a close relationship with Jonathan and they prayed together daily. George Whitefield, an evangelist, said of them, \\"A sweeter couple I have not yet seen.\\" At times, though, she became overwhelmed and felt unworthy. This was partly due to the pressure that she put upon herself to be held in high esteem by her husband and the community. She also became distressed by the success of visiting ministers when they preached at the church while Rev. Edwards was out of town. Inflation and the increasing family stretched the Edward's family budget. Jonathan asked for increases in his salary, but was generally turned down. By 1735, Sarah managed to cope during particularly stressful periods by turning herself over and making a personal covenant to God, which resulted in profound spiritual experiences. Great Awakening A Faithful Narrative of the Surprizing Work of God, by Jonathan Edwards, 1737 Although his books were popular in Britain and the American colonies, he had a hard time reaching the younger members of his congregation for seven years. In 1734, he preached sermons that captured the attention of the young adults, and one young woman was particularly affected by the feeling of acceptance and forgiveness for her sins. She became a loving and devoted worshipper, which incentivized other young adults. People of all ages found redemption and were found by family members to be reborn. The revival of 300 members of his congregation was the beginning of the Great Awakening that spread throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut. Jonathan wrote of the revival in A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God in 1737. Jonathan Edwards was the leader of the movement, more specifically known as New Light, where personal religious experiences are based on one's heart and reason. It was revolutionary and controversial. There were some ministers that condemned the work, while John Wesley, George Whitefield, and others were inspired by his message. Because New Light is based on one's emotions and reason, \\"Jonathan Edwards drew on the religious experience of women ‚Äî his wife included ‚Äî as models of God‚Äôs engagement of the affections.\\" Further, she was his partner in his ministry. His stance was rare for the Puritanical times when women were not considered capable of having deep spiritual experiences due to their \\"inferior biology\\". Sarah, who had been a devoted Christian, was also changed at this time. Beginning in late January 1742, Sarah fell into a depression or what may have been a nervous breakdown when her husband travelled throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut on a preaching tour. She became deeply distressed and her personality changed dramatically. She became impatient and needful, and she experienced spells of jabbering, fainting, and hallucinating. Her distress was sparked by a remark made by her husband before he left that she had been imprudent in some way and was made worse by her concern about finances and jealousy regarding the men who filled in as minister while her husband was away. She went from feeling the piercing wrath of God for her sinfulness and then transformed in light and love. She then began to have profound spiritual experiences, called religious ecstasy, over nine days. She felt \\"swallowed up with light and love and a sweet solace, rest and joy of soul that was altogether unspeakable.\\" For uninterrupted hours at a time, she felt Overcome by these experiences, she had physical reactions including loss of the ability to speak or stand, fainting, leaping for joy, or other physical reactions. She became committed to fighting sinfulness and to feel the intense spiritual awareness. She became stronger emotionally and spiritually with an innate awareness of assured salvation, rather than continual need to prove that she was worthy. Jonathan believed that she was brought to the brink of deep sadness to build a stronger personal connection with God. He said, \\"She was overwhelmed in the light and joy of the love of God,\\" and he considered her to be the \\"model of a truly Spirit-filled person\\". He asked her to write down her experiences which he edited for a work called Some Thoughts Concerning the Present Revival of Religion in New England. Missionaries In 1750, Jonathan preached that a \\"profession of godliness\\" was all that was needed to become a member of the church. This had a political impact, since church membership was the criteria for who could vote in the town. He also changed church policy so that only those who had been saved could take the Lord's Supper. As a result, he was dismissed that year. The family moved to Stockbridge in the Berkshires the following year and worked as missionaries among the Housatonic Indians, or Stockbridge Indians, and he ministered to the small number of colonists. At that time, the French and Indian War was in progress, with frequent raids in the area. Even so, Sarah developed good relationships and was hospitable to members of the community, including the local Native Americans. She cared for soldiers stationed in the barracks. During the following seven years, the family enjoyed their life near a river and at the foot of the Berkshire Hills, which was in the wilderness at that time. The children explored the area and Sarah and Jonathan took long walks in the meadows. Besides her devotion to the community, she tended to her children. She directed their academic, music, and religion studies. She led them in prayers and encouraged outdoor sports. Sarah and her daughters sold their needlework to augment the family's income. Death and legacy In 1757, Jonathan travelled to visit his daughter Esther Edwards Burr whose husband Rev. Aaron Burr Sr. died of smallpox during an epidemic in Newark, New Jersey. Burr was president of the College of New Jersey, now called Princeton University. Jonathan accepted the position of president of the college to replace his son-in-law in February 1758. He served as president, but died due to innoculation of the smallpox vaccine on March 22, 1758. Esther died in April 1858 and Sarah went to Newark to care for the Burr's orphaned children, Sally and Aaron Burr. In late September, Sarah left Princeton for Philadelphia where her orphaned grandchildren had been taken. They began their journey from Philadelphia to Northampton, where she intended to raise them. She became very ill with dysentery and after five days, she died at a friend's house in Philadelphia on October 2, 1758, six months after her husband's death. Their youngest daughter, Elizabeth, died soon after her parents. Her son, Timothy Edwards, raised Sally and Aaron Burr, who in 1800 would become the Vice President of the United States under Thomas Jefferson. In 1804, Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel. Timothy also raised Pierpont Edwards, Sarah's youngest son who was born in 1750 and orphaned at his parent's deaths in 1758. Jonathan and Sarah are buried in the Presidents Lot of the Princeton Cemetery. Two stone benches at Jonathan Edwards College at Yale University commemorate Jonathan and Sarah Edwards. Sarah Edwards bench is carved with the words \\"Friend, Neighbor, Mother, Wife, and Christian\\" from her tombstone. Based upon a study of their descendants in 1900, Sarah and Jonathan Edwards progeny are considered \\"one of the most accomplished families in American history\\" with 1 United States Vice President, 1 controller of the United States Treasury, 3 state governors, 30 judges, 3 United States senators, 3 mayors, 66 physicians, 100 overseas missionaries, numerous ministers, 65 college professors, and 13 college presidents.

Childhood  Eva Siewert was born in Breslau (today Wroc≈Çaw, Poland), the daughter of two musicians. Her father Hans Siewert (1872‚Äì1941), son of a chemistry professor at the University of C√≥rdoba (Argentina), was a Kammers√§nger. He became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (abbreviated in German as NSDAP) in 1932. Her mother Frida Siewert (born Michels, 1880‚Äì1953) was an opera and concert singer and a Jew, which is why her daughter later acquired the status of a \\"first- degree hybrid\\". Hans Siewert and Frida Siewert divorced in Hamburg in 1911. Siewert lived mostly with her mother in Berlin, but was raised by governesses. She attended the Hohenzollern lyceum in Berlin-Wilmersdorf, graduating in 1923 with a high school diploma (Obersekundarreife). Her schooling was interrupted only once, in 1915, for about a year and half. At the age of eight, Siewert later explained, she fled her mother and went to live with her father, who at the time was employed as a Kammers√§nger for the Grand Duchy of Baden in the city of Karlsruhe. It was only through a court order that she was forced to return to Berlin. Her relationship with her mother seems to have been poor in her early years. In 1948, Siewert wrote about her mother: \\"We have little in common apart from music.\\"  Early career  After graduating from high school, Siewert studied music, first with her mother, and then at the Berlin School of Music (see Berlin University of the Arts). Here she attended opera classes with Franz Ludwig H√∂rth (1883‚Äì1934), then director of the Berlin State Opera on Unter den Linden. She studied music theory with the composer Heinz Tiessen (1887‚Äì1971). From 1928 Siewert spent a season performing as a coloratura soprano at the Landestheater Oldenburg, but had to give it up due to illness. Asthmatic complaints made a public career as a singer impossible. As a result, Siewert shifted her main occupation to journalism from 1929. In 1928 she became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (in the local branch of Berlin-Halensee), but was at best only involved in party politics until 1930. Apparently she was at risk of acute unemployment during this period and suffered under an insecure job situation. Nothing is known today about Siewert's personal situation or milieu in Berlin in the 1920s. Only once, in a letter to the publicist Kurt Hiller (1885‚Äì1972) in 1957, did she mention that she had been friends with George Grosz' family since childhood. Siewert moved to Tehran in 1930, where she worked for a German export and import company. Her time abroad equipped her with good foreign language skills, and when Siewert returned to Germany a year later, she gave the first radio lectures about her travel experiences. Her voice impressed listeners, so in 1932 she was nominated by the International Radio Service Berlin for the post of a German-speaking announcer at Radio Luxemburg. From 1 July 1932 to 31 March 1938 she held a well-remunerated position as editor-in- chief and trilingual (German, English, French) head spokeswoman for the station. Siewert later wrote about her work for Radio Luxemburg: \\"During my time there I influenced almost every department of the broadcaster and was involved with program compilations, musical rehearsals, building up the record archive, library, and card indexes, as well as with the news services, translations, writing lectures on all kinds of topics, and the continuous announcement service in three languages. The station had a strong anti-fascist tendency.\\" According to Siewert, she was perceived by the public as the \\"voice of Radio Luxembourg\\", while in Germany she was suspected of being an \\"enemy\\" because of her work abroad and alleged \\"propaganda\\" against National Socialism.  Persecution during the Nazi period  In 1938, fearing the threat of war, Siewert decided to return to Tehran. She had to go back to Berlin first, however, in order to get a visa. This was denied to her due to her journalistic work, so she was \\"trapped\\" in Germany from that time on. Since Siewert was considered a \\"half-Jew\\" in the Nazi terminology, she was banned from working on broadcast radio or in the press and subsequently had to be content with less well-endowed positions as a typist and translator. It was probably in one of these jobs that she met her future girlfriend Alice Carl√© (1902‚Äì1943). In May 1941 Siewert was arrested for the first time and taken into protective custody. The reason for the arrest was a series of incriminating letters discovered during a search at the home of her friend Kl√§re Beier in Bielefeld. In her letters, Siewert had repeated anti-fascist jokes she had heard among friends. A few months later, she was fined for violating the Treachery Act of 1934. Later that same year, after taking up a new position at the German legal publisher, an incident occurred that not only resulted in her immediate dismissal, but also a prison sentence: Siewert was denounced by two work colleagues for the seditious offence of \\"undermining the military force\\" (Wehrkraftzersetzung). Again it related to jokes Siewert had told. In early September 1942, she was again sentenced under the Treachery Act ‚Äì this time to nine months in prison. In the judgement of 4 September 1942, it contemptuously stated: \\"The outward appearance of the accused is predominantly Jewish.\\" It was also stated that Siewert's relationship with one of the two work colleagues who denounced her had \\"an erotic element\\", but that since summer 1941, a certain estrangement had occurred. Apparently these hints of a possible same-sex relationship between the two women were not a disadvantage for Siewert; their effect was rather that the witness was classified as not very credible. In general, the court seemed convinced that the woman had repeatedly made incorrect or invalid statements. However, these qualifications were not enough to exonerate Siewert. Siewert served her prison sentence from 1 March to 1 December 1943 in the Berlin women's prison on Barnimstrasse 10, not far from Alexanderplatz. After an official medical examination, she was exempted from deployment to work crews outside Berlin because of her already compromised health, but was nevertheless assigned to \\"easier\\" jobs such as cable testing for AEG and the so-called \\"Aschinger taskforce\\". This was a work crew in the Aschinger bread factory on the corner of Prenzlauer Allee and Saarbr√ºcker Stra√üe, in which the prisoners were used to clean vegetables, produce canned goods and similar activities. When Siewert was finally released from prison, she was a broken person. For the remainder of the Second World War she was primarily engaged in illegal work, she later reported, because due to her record as a political criminal, no company would keep her on for more than three months at a time. Stolpersteine for the Carl√© family, Berlin, 2017 Siewert's imprisonment had fatal consequences not only for herself, but even more so for her girlfriend Alice Carl√©. Carl√© had stayed in Siewert's apartment several times before 1943 because she felt safe there, but during Siewert's imprisonment she was deprived of this crucial sanctuary from National Socialist surveillance. On 27 August 1943 Alice Carl√© and her sister Charlotte Carl√© (1901‚Äì1943) were arrested by the Gestapo and soon thereafter deported to Auschwitz, where they were both murdered that same year.  Postwar period  From her arrest in 1943 (at the latest) onwards, Siewert suffered from severe cardiovascular disease, which escalated to a heart attack in 1949 and necessitated constant medical care. Especially during the nine months she spent in Barnimstrasse Women's Prison, her health deteriorated significantly. In one accident she suffered a concussion, and from then on endured recurrent dizziness with nausea. She also suffered temporary hearing loss as a result of cysts on her eardrum. Siewert described her health complaints as \\"clear proof of her unbearable life among Germans\\". Overall, Germany was a \\"country of torment\\" for her, and she even viewed the so-called economic miracle with scepticism, especially after an anonymous note saying \\"Long live Germany!\\" was once stuck to her door by neighbours. Siewert regarded many of her fellow Germans as \\"unreformable\\", and in her correspondence with Kurt Hiller she fatalistically complained: \\"It makes no sense as a reasonable person to try to steer this insane ship with a hostile crew, surrounded by the shadows of the costly dead\\" and \\"One should let those who neither deserve nor desire anything better simply go under.\\" She cynically asked why this \\"Volk\\" (people) developed a reputation as being composed of poets and thinkers. Siewert humorously described herself as an \\"all-rounder\\". After 1945, Siewert was never able to continue her professional successes from before 1938. She was recognized as a political victim by the main Committee for the Victims of Fascism (Ausschuss f√ºr die Opfer des Faschismus) and due to her health problems received a so-called \\"severely injured\\" ID card given to people disabled during the war. She supplemented her meagre monthly pension through freelance journalism, writing for Die Weltb√ºhne, Der Sozialdemokrat, Der Spiegel, the Telegraf and Die Andere Zeitung, to name a few. To date, however, only a few dozen publications by Siewert have been identified. Evidently, Siewert's essays, features, reviews and polemics were largely lost in day-to-day business. The author left only scattered traces in the history of German-language journalism. A comprehensive bibliography on her work remains to be compiled.  Work as a writer  Siewert discussed her relationship with Alice Carl√© as well as Carl√©‚Äôs deportation and her own denunciation and subsequent detention in the autobiographical story \\"The Oracle\\" (Das Orakel). Although she does not explicitly speak of love here, it becomes clear that the \\"friendship\\" between the first-person narrator and \\"Alice\\" (a surname is not mentioned) is very close. The two women desperately plan to emigrate from Germany together for years until one day the narrator is arrested. Siewert's moving story \\"The Boat Pan\\" (Das Boot Pan), on the other hand, deals with the feelings of estrangement and loneliness that haunt the (this time) male first-person narrator when he faces the past and the painful loss of two friends, \\"about whose death nobody knew anything concrete\\" ‚Äì the girls \\"had no grave\\", the story explains. Even though National Socialism, Auschwitz and the Shoah are not mentioned, it can be interpreted that the two friends were based closely on the Carl√© sisters. With her longer manuscripts, Siewert was largely unsuccessful. The book she wrote about her prison stay at 10 Barnimstrasse has never been published. Her extended manuscript for a book on lesbian love has likewise never been published. In the letters exchanged between Siewert and Kurt Hiller in the year 1950, no working title was mentioned, but the book was repeatedly described as being about \\"gynephilia in women\\". More encouraging was the reception of the comedy play How Does Potiphar Behave? (Wie verh√§lt sich Potiphar), which premiered in Baden-Baden in the presence of the author in December 1949. Siewert found the performance by the artistic director Hannes Tannert (1900‚Äì1976) \\"outstanding in every respect\\" and \\"first class\\". She was also pleased with the \\"fairly good\\" response the comedy received despite its philosophical tendency. The play did not pay off financially for Siewert, however, and there were no further performances in other theatres after the premiere. Siewert's second comedy, On Wednesday at Five (Am Mittwoch um f√ºnf, 1955), was immediately accepted by the theatre section of the publishing house S. Fischer Verlag, but was apparently never performed. After 1945 Siewert again wrote contributions for the radio, as surviving documentation shows. For example, on 19 March 1957, to mark the \\"Day of Brotherhood\\", the Berlin broadcaster RIAS replayed a radio version of the story \\"Watchman\\" (W√§chter) written by Siewert. On 12 July 1970, the Bavarian radio station Bayerische Rundfunk broadcast a documentary feature by Siewert under the title Japan, Tatamis and White Waterfalls (Japan, Tatamis und wei√üe Wasserf√§lle).  Correspondence with Kurt Hiller  The correspondence between Siewert and the publicist and homosexual activist Kurt Hiller was abundant, especially up to the beginning of 1950. Only then did a period of silence of several years ensue, precipitated by Hiller's rejection of Siewert's manuscript on female homosexuality. Siewert had asked Hiller to write a foreword to her planned book. Later, in the spring of 1958, the correspondence between Siewert and Hiller once again broke off suddenly. Apparently the two had become increasingly estranged from one another over the years, despite statements to the contrary. Siewert's political attitudes may have played a role here. In the summer of 1947 she enthusiastically joined Hiller's German Socialist Freedom League (Freiheitsbund Deutscher Sozialisten or FDS) and willingly provided a room in her spacious apartment for the Berlin group's meetings. Siewert threw herself into shaping the association into \\"a potent party opposition to the SPD\\", but soon split with individual, communist-oriented members of the FDS who failed to distance themselves sufficiently from the East German Communist Party (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands, or SED). When Hiller attempted to win Siewert as a member of his New Socialist League (Neusozialistischer Bund) around 1956, Siewert reacted sympathetically, but was sceptical about her capacity for active participation due to her own health problems. Furthermore, her criticism of the SPD notwithstanding, she also wanted to avoid any weakening of its left wing. In her eyes, it was important not to play into the hands of the Adenauer government. Hiller, who always had a tendency to gather \\"followers\\" and not equal partners, reacted with reservation, against which Siewert protested. In a letter to Hiller, she denied \\"anyone who was not permanently resident in Berlin in the 12 years after the end of the Second World War and was not active there in public (to a greater or lesser extent)\\" the right to criticize her \\"reluctance to attend any political party, group or manifestation\\". She cynically asked if Hiller really thought it would make sense \\"in the face of avalanches to stake the little banner of the upright seven (it will hardly be much more) into the ground\\". Hiller was not accustomed to such dissent from Siewert.  Last years of life  Little is known about Siewert's living conditions from around the mid-1950s onwards. In the decades that followed, Siewert presumably lived in seclusion and in modest circumstances. She dreamed of living abroad several times and intended to emigrate to Portugal in 1958, apparently unsuccessfully. She regarded France as her spiritual home, but could not afford to move there. On 3 December 1994 Siewert was found dead in her apartment at S√ºdwestkorso 33 in the Berlin suburb of Wilmersdorf, where she had lived since 1977. She was buried in the cemetery on Bergstrasse in the nearby suburb of Steglitz. However, after the legal rest period in 2016, the grave was reallocated.  Rediscovery  The rediscovery of Siewert came about in the course of research conducted by the historian . Around 2015, Wolfert increasingly turned his attention to unearthing the biographies of people from the second German homosexual rights movement (1950s) and came across the name Eva Siewert. In 2018, research into the life and work of Siewert was conducted by a four-person project team based at the Magnus Hirschfeld Society in Berlin. In cooperation with Wolfert, Sigrid Grajek, Martina Minette Dreier and Christine Olderdissen set up a \\"digital memorial room\\", which was completed in January 2019. The website is a so-called \\"scrollytelling\\" project, a multimedia site that contains texts as well as numerous photos and audio contributions. The project was funded by the Berlin State Office for Equal Treatment Against Discrimination (Berliner Landesstelle f√ºr Gleichbehandlung gegen Diskriminierung or LADS).

Taxonomy The species was established based on specimens that previously were classified as Z. obesum, Z. isselianum or Z. frauenfeldii. It is named after the solid, robust shell of the holotype (lat.: robustum: robust). Description Zospeum robustum has an average shell height of ca. 1.6 mm and an average shell width of ca. 1.1 mm. The shell is transparent and has an ovate-conical shape, showing a high variability in shape. It is either smooth or ribbed, sometimes at the uppermost part of the whorl or the entire whorl. The shell possesses between 4.75 and 6 whorls, whereby the last whorl is sometimes expanded. The opening (aperture) is taller than wide. The peristome is roundish, sometimes quite massive, in most cases with a small, straight parietal shield. The shell has a parietalis and a weak columellaris. The columellaris is completely absent in those populations with ribbed shells. Distribution Zospeum robustum occurs in Croatia in three separate areas: 1) In the caves Budina ≈°pilja and Markov ponor in the Lika-Senj region, as well as in Ostrviƒçka ≈°pilja and the upper part of the Lukina jama-Trojama cave system. 2) In the caves Tonkoviƒáa ≈°pilja and ≈†pilja pod Maƒçkovom dragom in the north of Ogulin. 3) In three caves in and around the ≈Ωumberak Mountains: Vrlovka, Pu≈°ina jama and ≈Ωidovske kuƒáe.

Lindsstr√∂m's senior commands include postings as commanding officer of Karlskrona and Stockholm Naval Stations, the South and East Coast Naval District, and as Chief of the Naval Staff. Lindsstr√∂m was active during the era of the Sverige-class coastal defence ships and made significant efforts to develop this type of coastal defence ship. Early life Lindsstr√∂m was born on 8 October 1876 in Visby, Sweden, the son of Victor Olof Lindsstr√∂m, a wholesaler, and his wife Sophia Antonia S√∂derberg. He was a cadet at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy in 1890 and was the youngest and at the top of his class who graduated in 1896. He then went on to the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College in 1902 in the usual order and graduated in 1904 with the highest grades, which up to that point had ever been awarded. Career Lindsstr√∂m captained his first ship, the torpedo boat no. 81, in 1904. He served in the Artillery Department at the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration from 1904 to 1907. He was a weapons teacher at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy from 1905 to 1910 and during his numerous tours at sea, Lindsstr√∂m was, among other things, flag lieutenant (flaggadjutant) on eight different expeditions between 1905 and 1913. Lindsstr√∂m became a member and secretary of the Naval Warfare Materiel Committee (Sj√∂krigsmaterielkommitt√©n) in 1906 and served as adjutant to the Inspector of the Navy's Exercises at Sea, Rear Admiral Wilhelm Dyrssen, from 1907 to 1910. From 1910 to 1912, he served in the High Seas Fleet of the Imperial German Navy and in 1913 he was appointed Adjutant to His Majesty the King Gustaf V (Chief Adjutant in 1925). Lindsstr√∂m served from 1913 to 1914 in a Advisory Study (F√∂rsvarsberedning) and from 1917 to 1919 as a naval attach√© in Berlin and Copenhagen. He was also a member of the Swedish Naval Studies Commission which, in the autumn of 1917, visited Germany with the main residence in the Flanders area occupied by the German Army (Zeebrugge-Ostend). The results of this Commission's report contributed, among other things, to a large extent to the introduction of new firing rules and effective fire control devices on the Sverige-class coastal defence ships. Lindsstr√∂m then served as head of the Operations Department in the Naval Staff from 1919 to 1925 and as a teacher of strategy in the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1919 to 1924. Lindsstr√∂m served as captain of the armoured cruiser during a voyage around South America from 1922 to 1923 and as captain of the coastal defence ship in 1924. He was commanding officer of the Winter Squadron (Vintereskadern) in 1926 and served as Captain of the Fleet (Flaggkapten) in the staff of the Coastal Fleet from 1925 to 1930 as well as head of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College from 1930 to 1933. In 1932 he was commanding officer of the Submarine Division and from 1933 to 1939, Lindsstr√∂m served as a naval expert in Sweden's delegation at the League of Nations' Geneva Disarmament Conference. He was commanding admiral and station commander in Karlskrona from 1933 to 1936 and Chief of the Naval Staff also in 1936. Lindsstr√∂m served as station commander in Stockholm from 1936 to 1937 and was military member of the Supreme Court of Sweden from 1937. He then served as commanding admiral of the East Coast Naval District from 1937 to 1942 when he retired from the navy. During his career, Lindsstr√∂m published a number of books, for example L√§robok i elektricitetsl√§ra (together with J. Eklund, 1903), Maritima operationsbaser (1905), L√§robok i artilleri f√∂r K. sj√∂krigsskolan (1908), and V√§rldsisl√§ran, en bro mellan vetenskap och myt (1935). He also wrote a variety of minor essays and brochures on naval military issues. Later career After retiring from the navy, Lindsstr√∂m worked for the shipping company Rederi AB Nordstjernan in Stockholm from 1942 to 1948. In 1950, he left his position as military member of the Supreme Court. Later he was chairman of the Swedish Archipelago Association (Svenska Sk√§rg√•rdsf√∂rbundet). In this capacity he presented proposals on the arrangement of the communications in the Stockholm archipelago. Personal life On 1 September 1919 he married Hertha von Koerner (22 October 1883 in Dresden ‚Äì 6 December 1983), the daughter of Geheimrat Paul von Koerner, J.D., and Margarete Wahle.

It is part of the Helm Identification Guides series. The book is Forsman's second about raptor identification, following his 1999 book The Raptors of Europe and the Middle East, which also covered perched birds. Unlike the 1999 book, Flight Identification of Raptors covers North Africa, and includes over 60 species (compared to 43 in the first book), with both North African species and rare vagrants to the Western Palearctic region (Europe, North Africa and the Middle East), such as Pallas' fish eagle, being added. The book is a photographic field guide, and contains an introduction, two essays from other authors about topics related to raptors, and descriptions of each of the species covered. There are also discussions of common hybrids, which can make identification more complicated. The book received positive reviews. On the Birdguides website, Josh Jones called it \\"a wonderful photo guide\\" and a \\"worthy addition to an esteemed series\\". He particularly praised the quality of the photos (many of which Forsman took himself), which were also praised by other reviewers. In a review for the British Trust for Ornithology website, Su Gough wrote \\"every bit of this book strikes you with the sheer amount of work and knowledge that has gone into it\\". Jones, as well as Andy Stoddart, in an otherwise positive review for the website Rare Bird Alert, did comment that the book lacked coverage of the sanctijohannis subspecies of the rough-legged hawk, and that a photograph of the dark morph could have been included. Several reviewers shows how difficult raptor identification is, due to the large number of possible hybrids as well as variation within species.

Originally a textbook marketing company, it came under scrutiny in May 2020 after it had provided large datasets of COVID-19 patients which were subsequently found to be extremely unreliable. The questionable data was used in studies published in the The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2020, suggesting that COVID-19 patients on hydroxychloroquine had a \\"significantly higher risk of death.\\" In light of these studies, the World Health Organization decided to temporarily halt global trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. After the studies were retracted, the WHO trials were resumed. History Surgisphere was established in 2008 by Sapan Desai, then a medical resident, to market medical textbooks to medical students. Fake five-star reviews on Amazon from accounts impersonating actual physicians were found. Desai became a vascular surgeon and worked at Northwest Community Hospital. Surgisphere had three subsidiaries: Surgical Outcomes Collaborative, Vascular Outcomes, and Quartz Clinical. From 2010 to 2013 it published an online medical journal, the Journal of Surgical Radiology. It ceased publication despite having claimed to accrue 50,000 subscribers, because Desai \\"ran out of time.\\" In June 2020 Desai's spokesperson said Surgisphere had 11 employees and had been compiling a global hospital records database since 2008. In its promotional material and press releases, Surgisphere claimed to have a cloud-based healthcare data analytics platform and to be \\"leveraging... its global research network and advanced machine learning\\" using decision tree analysis. After the retractions of two studies in June 2020, company social media accounts were deleted, and on 15 June 2020, the company website was taken offline. =COVID-19 misconduct=Lancet and NEJM articles Surgisphere provided dubious data used for studies of COVID-19 that were published in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in May 2020. The Lancet study claimed that the dataset of hospital records showed that patients taking hydroxychloroquine were more likely to die in hospital, and prompted the World Health Organization to halt global trials of the drug to treat COVID-19. The NEJM study claimed that hospital data records showed that COVID-19 patients were not harmed by treatment with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers. The dataset from the alleged 1200 hospitals had many errors, including the listing of an Asian hospital as being in Australia, and no indications of how Surgisphere could collect the data, and was widely criticised. As a result, on 28 May over 200 researchers and doctors from various countries published \\"An open letter to Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, regarding Mehra et al,\\" stating \\"Both the numbers of cases and deaths, and the detailed data collection, seem unlikely.\\" Science Magazine said critics had \\"pointed out many red flags in the Lancet paper, including the astonishing number of patients involved and details about their demographics and prescribed dosing that seem implausible.\\" One of the signatories, Adrian Hernandez of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, said \\"the biggest thing that raised a red flag was that here was such a large database across more than 600 hospitals, and no one had really known about its existence.\\" On 3 June 2020, The Lancet and the NEJM released online \\"expressions of concern\\" about the published studies. and on 4 June the Lancet paper was retracted by Mehra, Ruschitzka, and Amit Patel, all authors except Desai. In their retraction, the three wrote Surgisphere had not transferred \\"the full dataset, client contracts, and the full ISO audit report to their servers for analysis as such transfer would violate client agreements and confidentiality requirements,\\" preventing reviewers from conducting an independent and private peer review. The three authors said: :\\"We can never forget the responsibility we have as researchers to scrupulously ensure that we rely on data sources that adhere to our high standards. Based on this development, we can no longer vouch for the veracity of the primary data sources. Due to this unfortunate development, the authors request that the paper be retracted.\\" On 4 June, The Lancet retracted the study, as did the NEJM. In the meantime, on 3 June, the WHO resumed its hydroxychloroquine drug trials. On 6 June 2020, NHS Scotland told the Financial Times that they had \\"no current or past contractual arrangement\\" with Surgisphere, nor was the company an approved supplier, nor had it ever had access to data, despite Surgisphere stating it had \\"collaborated\\" with the NHS. Surgisphere's website had a picture of Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, an NHS hospital in Glasgow. On 7 June 2020, fellow author Amit Patel's position with University of Utah was terminated over the journal retractions. Patel is Desai's brother-in-law. Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of The Lancet, called the paper a fabrication and \\"a monumental fraud\\". Eric Rubin, editor-in-chief of NEJM, said \\"We shouldn‚Äôt have published this\\". Ivermectin preprint In April 2020, Desai et al. published a paper based on purported Surgisphere data which suggested ivermectin reduced COVID-19 mortality. It was described as a \\"retrospective matched-control study of coronavirus patients using a real-time hospitalization database\\". It was published as preprint but was retracted at the end of May. Several Latin American government health organizations recommended ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment based, in part, on this preprint; these recommendations were later denounced by the Pan American Health Organization. Diagnostic tool Starting in March of 2020 Surgisphere promoted a \\"rapid diagnostic tool\\" for COVID-19, which it said was in use by over 1000 hospitals. The African Federation for Emergency Medicine (AFEM) had promoted the COVID-19 Severity Scoring Tool for use in 26 countries and some institutions had started validation studies. On 5 June 2020, following the Surgisphere scandal, AFEM recommended that the tool no longer be used. General legitimacy By 26 May 2020, doubts were raised that a company based in a rented office could have access to legitimate data.Statistical Modeling, Causal Inference, and Social Science - Doubts about that article claiming that hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine is killing people: Comment 1345327 A July 2020 article in New York Times described an employee extracting data manually to create a spreadsheet for Surgisphere's QuartzClinical. She was \\"surprised\\" by claims of a massive datastore, stating she knew of only a single hospital that had signed a contract with the company; the May 1 paper in NEJM claimed to use data from 169 hospitals across the globe, and the May 22 paper in The Lancet. A parallel investigation by the British newspaper The Guardian revealed that several of Surgisphere's employees had little or no scientific background; one employee appeared to be a science fiction author while another, listed as a marketing executive, was an adult model. The Guardian also found that Surgisphere's LinkedIn page has fewer than 100 followers and in late May 2020 listed only six employees. It also found that the company had almost no online presence and that its Twitter account had made no posts from October 2017 to March 2020.

When atmospheric testing was halted in the 1960s, the laboratory‚Äôs work was re- directed towards the study of plant root systems and their interactions with agricultural soils. In recognition of this transition, the laboratory was renamed The Letcombe Laboratory in 1969. Under this new guise, it came to resemble more closely numerous other agricultural research institutions owned and/or funded by UK‚Äôs Agricultural Research Council (ARC) (Cooke, 1981). These were made-up of eight institutes directly under ARC control together with fourteen ARC grant-aided institutes in England and Wales and eight in Scotland. In 1983, the ARC was re-organised and renamed the Agricultural and Food Research Council (AFRC) and, two years later, central government expenditure cuts forced the Letcombe Laboratory to close along with the nearby AFRC Weed Research Organisation with which the Letcombe Laboratory had collaborated closely. The site was then bought by the Dow Chemical Company and used as a centre for crop fungicide research.  First beginnings  In the 1950s, radioactive fall-out in the UK from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing by the USA, Britain and the USSR and from peaceful uses of atomic energy was being monitored by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) with attendant risks to human health, especially from strontium-90, being assessed by the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAAF) and the UK Medical Research Council. In addition, the then Director of the UKAEA Sir John Cockroft initiated a small research group lead by Dr Robert Scott Russell at the University of Oxford Department of Agriculture to examine the movement of nuclear fission products in soil and plants. In 1954, a committee headed by (Lord) Victor Rothschild recommended that this work be expanded by providing the Oxford group with facilities at the nearby ARC Field Station at Compton, Oxfordshire, later to become the Institute for Research on Animal Diseases (closed in 2016). In 1956, 15 staff moved into newly constructed accommodation. Lead scientists included a radiochemist, plant physiologist, field agronomist and a veterinary scientist. However, the arrangement was not entirely satisfactory and, in August 1957, it was agreed that the Agricultural Research Council should seek new premises and take over responsibility for expanding the work to include not only nationwide surveys of radionuclide contamination of soil, herbage and human food (notably strontium-90 in milk, and caesium-137) but also experimental studies of how radioactive substances move through soil and into plants and the food chain. The extent to which the nuclear fire at Windscale Cumberland (now Cumbria) just two months later energised matters is unclear. But, by November that year, new appointees had been installed in temporary quarters provided by UKAEA on a former military airfield at RAF Grove, near Wantage, Oxfordshire and were soon evaluating grass and milk collected from the Windscale area (Loutit et al., 1960; Ellis et al., 1960). The first in a long series of reports from the ARC Radiobiological Laboratory on nationwide nuclear contamination appeared in 1959. The following year, the report was mentioned in a debate on strontium-90 contamination reported in Hansard, the UK House of Commons record of parliamentary business, and in the British Medical Journal in April 1960.  Relocation and re-emphasis  The south front of Letcombe Manor in 1978 with new laboratory wing added in 1962. In 1959, the sizeable Letcombe Manor Estate at Letcombe Regis, a small downland village in the county of Berkshire (Oxfordshire from 1974), was purchased by ARC as the laboratory‚Äôs permanent home. The 19th Century manor house (photograph) was retained for administration and several new buildings and experimental glasshouses added. By March 1962, most remaining staff at Grove and Compton had been transferred along with Russell as Director. The impact of an influx of scientists on the existing rural population of only a few hundred was considerable with the village undoubtedly benefitting from new job opportunities, more income for local businesses and a revitalisation of the parish council, primary school and general social life. However, the abandoning of atmospheric atomic weapon testing in 1962 and the signing of the Partial Test Ban Treaty the following year reduced radioactive fallout and thus placed a question mark over the long-term need for the Laboratory. Russell‚Äôs response was to move the laboratory‚Äôs work gradually in favour of experimental studies of plant root function by making use of existing research strengths and radioactivity- measuring equipment. A national centre of expertise in root physiology was certainly desirable since scientific understanding of roots lagged far behind that of above-ground parts despite the tending of the root environment (i.e., the soil) being a major task of arable farming. The research was organised primarily around laboratory-based physiology linked to studies of root behaviour in the field, the latter concentrating on the impact of recently introduced minimal cultivation and direct drilling techniques on soil conditions and root performance. These field studies, in particular, benefitted from close collaboration with the nearby ARC Weed Research Organisation at Begbroke, Oxfordshire and with the MAAF Experimental Field Drainage Unit at Cambridge. The direction of this work was also influenced by a report from the UK Agricultural Advisory Board and MAFF entitled ‚ÄòModern farming and the soil‚Äô.  Rise, fall and rebirth  Lord Victor Rothschild (centre) visiting the Letcombe Laboratory in September 1973 prior to delivering a speech. He is accompanied on the left by Dr R.S. Russell (Director) and on the right by the Honourable J. J. Astor (Chairman of ARC). The re-orientated Letcombe Laboratory attracted several new principal investigators and, over the next 20 years, proved increasingly productive in terms of its scientific output and influence on farming practice. During that time, publications on root physiology and agronomy amounted to some 420 peer- reviewed articles, 100 book chapters, 13 authored or edited books and 150 shorter reports. In addition, there were numerous publications relating to the work on radionuclide contamination which continued on a diminished scale throughout. In May 1982, under Dr J.V. Lake (Director since 1978) the laboratory marked its silver jubilee with three consecutive open days under the banner of ‚ÄúRoots at Work‚Äù. However, despite this high watermark, cracks were already appearing in the financial and conceptual support for Letcombe and similar organisations. These were clearly discernible in the views of the highly influential (Lord) Victor Rothschild, who had been Chairman of the Agricultural Research Council from 1948 to 1958 and, as stated above, instrumental in bringing Letcombe Laboratory into being in the first place. Years earlier, Rothchild‚Äôs discontent with how research priorities were identified and acted upon was outlined in a lectureRothschild, L. (1953). The jubilee lecture - agricultural research, 1953. In: Science and fruit. Eds. T. Wallace and R.W. Marsh. Pp. 1-10. University of Bristol. marking the 1953 golden jubilee of Long Ashton Research Station another ARC- funded laboratory then specialising in fruit research. By 1971, these views were formalised and extended by Rothschild‚Äôs influential but controversial report ‚ÄúThe Organisation and Management of Government R&D;‚Äù. At the time, Rothschild was Head of the Central Policy Review Staff, a part of Central Government‚Äôs Cabinet Office. By 1974, his recommendations had been acted-on. They created tensions at Letcombe and elsewhere between perceived needs for applied research to be paid for by MAAF (the ‚Äúcustomer‚Äù) and more curiosity- driven work to be funded by ARC (the ‚Äúcontractor‚Äù). In a speech made at Letcombe in September 1973 Rothschild foreshadowed the Laboratory‚Äôs eventual closure by stating ‚Äú We have to realise that we have neither the money nor the resources to do all those things we would like to do and so often feel we have the right to do‚Äù (Agricultural Research Council, 1974). Because of its wide implications for the public expenditure in the UK, the speech made headline news in the national press. In the year following Letcombe‚Äôs Silver Jubilee (1982), AFRC published a Corporate Plan which announced that the Letcombe Laboratory would be closed to help accommodate a ¬£2.4 million cut in the Council‚Äôs budget (the ‚ÄúBarnes Cuts‚Äù) and to comply with new central government policy of leaving near-market science to the private sector. Some scientists were relocated to either University of Bristol‚Äôs Long Ashton Research Station (closed in 2003) or to Rothamsted Experimental Station (now Rothamsted Research Ltd) with some existing long-term field experiments located elsewhere in the country being retained and allowed to run their course. By 1985, the Letcombe site had been sold to Dow Elanco a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company. The name Letcombe Laboratory was retained and the site redeveloped as the company‚Äôs European centre for fungicide research.

The club is based in the Central Coast suburb of Tacoma, New South Wales.  Club History  Australian rules football was introduced to the Central Coast region in the early 1970s when Gosford were founded in 1971 and joined the Newcastle Australian Football League. However, despite interest of forming a competition based on the Coast, Gosford were currently the only club in the region. After an advertisement was placed in the newspaper that served the Wyong district, the Advocate Newspaper, a meeting was held in the CWA Hall in Long Jetty in September 1975 which led to the establishment of The Lakes Australian Football Club, which is what the club was known at the time. The Lakes were one of five foundation clubs of the Central Coast Australian Football League, along with Gosford Tigers, Narara Wyoming Bulldogs, Terrigal Panthers and Woy Woy Swans. The Lakes were based at Tacoma Oval, which today is their current home ground, which only had male and female toilets and a cricket pitch in the centre of the field until the late 1970s when changerooms were built. The Lakes finished the inaugural 1976 CCAFL season in fourth spot, and made the Grand Final which they lost by 10 points to Gosford. But the favour was returned in the following Grand Final of 1978 when The Lakes beat Gosford by 10 points, and won the 1979 flag over Woy Woy. The 1980s however, saw the end of the Magpies' success and some long losing streaks also. During that same time period, the name was changed from 'The Lakes' to 'Wyong' with very little success, being renamed again not long after to 'Wyong Lakes' to recognise the club's past and local area that the club represents. The 1990s saw the Magpies improve on the field, with the First Grade side heading deep into the Finals series and the Reserves making the Grand Final, which they would eventually lose. Despite the club's improvement on the field, the Magpies were still unable enough to bring home another flag. The Black Diamond Australian Football League was formed in 2000 following the merger between the Central Coast and Newcastle leagues, in which the same decade saw a decline for the Magpies, withdrawing from the Black Diamond Cup in 2001 due to increased travel time for away games in Newcastle and the departure and retirement of players. Wyong Lakes played in the Second Grade with some successful premiership seasons in 2003 and 2004, which saw them return to the Black Diamond Cup in 2005. That same year saw the club celebrate its 30th anniversary. After some more mixed results Wyong Lakes again withdrew from the BDAFL's top flight competition to rebuild in 2012. The BDAFL introduced a third men's competition in 2014 which further helped the club build and gain new players, which resulted in a 2014 1st Division Grand Final win over Newcastle City reserves by 20 points. The Magpies again qualified for Finals in 2015 but 2016 saw them drop down to sixth spot in a ten-team competition. Wyong Lakes fielded their first Women's team in 2015 which finished 5th with 3 wins and 11 losses. The 2017 season saw an improvement for Wyong Lakes, finishing as minor premiers and again qualifying for Finals before eventually bowing out to Singleton by 28 points. 2018 saw the Magpies return to the Black Diamond Cup where they finished the season 7th in an eleven-team competition.

According to Apollodorus 1.9.17, the sons of Jason and Hypsipyle were Euneus and Nebrophonus, while according to Hyginus, Fabulae 15, they were Euneus and Deipylus. the daughter of King Thoas of Lemnos,Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica 1.620-621; Apollodorus, 1.9.17; Hyginus, Fabulae 15, 254; Statius, Thebaid 5.38-39. who was the son of Dionysus and Ariadne.Grimal, s.v.

When the women of Lemnos massacred the Lemnian men, Hypsipyle secretly helped her father escape from the island. Hypsipyle was made queen of Lemnos, and she received Jason and the Argonauts when they visited the island. The Argonauts stayed for a while and mated with the women there.Grimal, s.v. Hypsipyle; Tripp, s.v. Hypsipyle; Oxford Classical Dictionary, s.v. Hypsipyle; Hard, p. 384; Gantz, p. 345. Euripides' Hypsipyle Thoas was a character in Euripides' partially preserved play Hypsipyle.Collard and Cropp, pp. 251-254; Gantz, pp. 346, 511; Grimal, s.v. Thoas 2; Euripides Hypsipyle test. iiia (Hypothesis) [= P.

According to this account, when Jason left Lemnos, he took his infant sons, Thoas and Euneus, with him to Colchis. After he died, Jason's fellow argonaut Orpheus took the boys to Thrace, where he raised them. They eventually met Hypsipyles' father Thoas, who took them back to Lemnos. As young men, the sons embark on a search for their mother.Euripides, Hypsipyle fr. 759a.93-105 (Collard and Cropp, pp. 314-315). As the action of the play begins, Thoas and his brother Euneus, arrive at the home of Lycurgus in Nemea,Euripides Hypsipyle test. iiia (Hypothesis) [= P. Oxy. 2455 frs. 14-15, 3652 cols. i and ii.1-15], fr. 752c [= 764 Nauck]. where their mother Hypsipyle, as a result of the discovery of her having saved her father Thoas, is now a slave, and the nurse of Lycugus' infant son Opheltes. Hypsipyle, who does not recognize her sons, greets them at the door.Euripides Hypsipyle fr. 752d. After Opheltes, while in the care of Hypsipyle, is killed by a serpent, funeral games are held, in which Thoas and Euneus compete. There is a recognition scene in which Hypsipyle and her sons are reunited, and Thoas and Euneus manage to rescue their mother and they all return to Lemnos.Euripides Hypsipyle fr. 759a. The surviving fragments of Euripides' play do not make it clear how the recognition between the sons and Hypsipyle was brought about, but two later accounts may have been based on the play.Collard and Cropp, pp. 253 259, tests. iv, va with notes. According to the Second Vatican Mythographer, after the sons won the foot-race, at the funeral games, their names and parents were announced, and in this way their identities were revealed.Second Vatican Mythographer 141 Bode [= Euripides Hypsipyle test. va = 164 Pepin, pp. 166-167]. The Cyzicene epigrams, the third book of the Palatine Anthology, describes a depiction, on a temple in Cyzicus, of Euneus and Thoas showing Hypsipyle a gold ornament (\\"the golden vine\\") as proof of their identities.Greek Anthology 3.10 [= Palatine Anthology 3.10 = Euripides Hypsipyle test. iv]. Compare with Euripides Hypsipyle fr. 759a.110, where Euneus mentions a \\"wine-dark grape-bunch\\". Statius' Thebaid Statius in his epic poem, the Thebaid, has a few brief mentions of Thoas and his brother Euneus. He has Hypsipyle call the twins \\"memorials of a forced bed\\",Statius, Thebaid 5.463-464. and describe Jason as \\"uncaring for his children\\".Statius, Thebaid 5.471-474. Statius describes Thoas and Euneus competing in the chariot race at Opheletes' funeral games: Statius, Thebaid, 6.340-345, 433-435, 466, 475-476. :And see, the young sons of Jason, new glory of their mother Hypsipyle, come to a chariot ... Thoas‚Äîfamily name from his grandfather‚Äîand Euneos ... Twins, they had everything the same: face, chariot, horses, dress, nor less concord in their prayers; each wishes to win or to be outrun only by his brother. ... Close together come the twins, now Euneos in front, now Thoas; they yield, they lead, nor ever does ambition for glory cause these loving brothers to clash. ... Thoas begs piebald Podarces to take off ... As he eagerly presses to pass Haemonian Admetus, Thoas crashes, nor did his brother bring him any aid.\\" NotesReferences * Apollodorus, Apollodorus, The Library, with an English Translation by Sir James George Frazer, F.B.A., F.R.S. in 2 Volumes.

Second Bill The second bill of the same name was presented to Parliament for its first reading by the prominent Conservative Eurosceptic MP for Kettering Philip Hollobone almost exactly a year after the first bill was presented on 20 June 2013, some five months after the Bloomberg speech although unlike the previous bill it never received a second reading and the bill failed to progress any further partly due to the fact at exactly the same time the European Union (Referendum) Bill 2013‚Äì14 was going through the House of Commons and had the wider support of the Conseravtive Party including the support of the then Prime Minister David Cameron.

'The city's misfortune' ), sometimes spelled Shahar-i-Ashob, is an ancient Urdu poetic genre in South Asia with its roots in lamented classical Urdu poetry. It was existed and widely used by the poets between the 16th and 19th centuries during the Mughal Empire. Ashob remained an historical genre in Persian, Urdu and Turkish literature used by the writers, predominantly by the Mughal poets to express their anguish and sorrows over political and social shifts. The Ashobs are generally describing emotional thoughts of a writer in a narrative poem based on several competencies. It reads naturally or conversationally and begins as a kind of photographic depiction of a moment (such as war, invasion etc.) in anguish. It consists of five to six stanzas normally written in rhymed verse for the first four lines. The first line rhymes with the second, third and fourth, and the fifth line rhymes with none, but combines the thoughts collectively.  History  Ashob originally came into existence in 16th century. It was first introduced in south Asia by the Mughal poets, including Masud Sa'd Salman, who started writing Ashobs during his literary career. Some ashobs were also written by Shakir Naji who served in the Army of the Mughal Empire during Muhammad Shah's reign. When the king was defeated, he covered major impacts of military conflict on the Mughal kingdom. An Indian poet Qayem Chandpuri was also engaged in writing ashobs. His writing covered civil‚Äìmilitary relations, mainly military aid between the sixteenth Mughal ruler Shah Alam II and Maratha Empire in order to defeat Zabita Khan in 1772. Some prominent poets, including Mir Taqi Mir and Mirza Muhammad Rafi Sauda are also credited with \\"ashob writings\\". Mirza wrote a list of ashobs on Nader Shah's invasion of India, while Mir wrote on economic crisis of Delhi. Later (around 1708‚Äì1710), ashob was merely used after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, and since then it began disappearing until the British rule made several people flee across the Indian subcontinent to the neighboring states or countries. It is believed the ashob was popularized during the 1857 uprising in India, but later it was not used in the modern literature.  Poems written in ashobs  In 1979, a writer named Naeem Ahmad wrote a book on Shahr Ashob's birth titled Shahr Ashob Ka Tahqiqi Mutalaah (A Brief study of the Shahr Ashob). The book, currently serving only in Urdu language, was later published by the University of California.

He served as an officer in the Givati Brigade and was severely wounded on the Gaza Strip in 2012 where he lost his left hand in battle.  Biography  Ziv Shilon was born in Beer-Sheva. His mother, Margalit, was a kindergarten teacher and educator, and his father, Zvi, was an entrepreneur and business owner in the textile industry. Shilon is the youngest of two brothers and sister. He finished high school at \\"Mekif Gimel\\" in Be'er Sheva and played basketball for the Hapoel Be‚Äôer Sheva youth group. In 2006, Shilon joined the Givati Brigade, a combat unit in the Israeli Defense Force. Shilon served in the IDF for 8 years in different roles. On October 23 2012, Shilon was critically injured during a military operation on the Gaza border. An explosive device that was planted on the fence severed his left hand and severely damaged his right hand. Subsequently, he underwent 17 surgical operations and 11 months of intensive rehabilitation. Shilon's military service began in 2006 when he enlisted in the Givati Brigade. During his service, he embarked on a radar and infantry officer course at the IDF Officers School, where he held a variety of positions and participated in numerous operations and activities, including Operational Cast Lead. During his service, he received several honors and praise for his performance. In his last position, he was a company commander (in the rank of captain) of the Givati Brigade. On October 23, 2012, during an operation in the Gaza Strip, Ziv and his forces set off to purge the border from explosives and tunnels. In the final moments of completing the operation, Shilon approached the security fence to open one of the gates and allow the unit tanks and armed forces to return to Israeli territory once the final segment of the operation was finished. Meanwhile, his soldiers remained 250 metres behind, in safe shelters, covering him from snipers. As a commander, Ziv made the decision to lead the first part of the mission himself. When he opened the gate, an improvised explosive device (IED) detonated and exploded directly on his body. Ziv needed to vacate from the border and into his vehicle while both of his hands were destroyed and his entire body burnt and bleeding. After a few seconds on the ground, he successfully managed to evacuate by himself and return to his soldiers, carrying the remains of his right hand. After receiving first aid from his medic and doctor, Shilon was transported by a helicopter to the hospital in critical condition. Shilon underwent surgery to restore his right hand. From then on, he experienced an intensive 11 months of hospitalization and rehabilitation. In December 2016, Shilon was released from active duty in the IDF after 10 years of service. In 2014, Shilon proposed to his wife during a speech held in Florida on behalf of the friends of the IDF (FIDF), and a few months later, they got married. Currently, Ziv and his wife live in Herzliya with their eldest daughter, Shira, and their son, Jonathan. Shilon was regularly engaged in social activities and has initiated and established numerous social projects. In 2015, he was chosen \\"Man of the Year\\" by the readers of Yedioth Ahronoth. In 2018, he was awarded by Ministry of Defense with a medal for his service and rehabilitation process. When it was time for Ziv Shilon to be discharged from the intensive care unit, he decided that he wanted the Israeli flag wrapped around him. In 2019, he was honored for his services and achievements by the Chief of the General Staff, Gadi Eisenkott, in the presence of all the senior commanders.  Social and business activity  Ziv Shilon has a Bachelor of Laws diploma from IDC Herzliya's Law School. In 2014, Shilon took part of the planning team for a national day of recognition for IDF casualties along with activists from Bnei Akiva and Deputy Speaker of the Knesset, Yoni Chetboun. In January 2015, Shilon constructed a project called \\"Someone to Run With in which injured fighters participated along with boys who were defined as \\"at-risk youth\\" in physical activities and extreme sports. As part of the project, youth from all over the country joined and participated in personal development competitions and workshops with IDF casualties who guided the youth members until they were recruited to the IDF. In March 2016, along with his fellow classmates and several senior staff members at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC), Shilon founded the ‚ÄúRoots program to help injured soldiers after rehabilitation in choosing their career paths, receiving admission to universities and success in finding employment opportunities. In April 2016, he launched the \\"Combat Fitness\\" project in the only juvenile detention facility in Israel, \\"Ofek Prison\\". It was created in collaboration with the IDF Association and the prison administration. The goal of ‚ÄúCombat Fitness\\" was to facilitate the rehabilitation of adolescent boys through empowerment and genuine connection with the IDF soldiers. They would then be provided with pre-military preparations and become integral members of the IDF after their release. = Political activity = In January 2017, following a Facebook post by Shilon illuminating the country's divide and polarization in Israeli society on disagreements regarding the Elor Azaria affair, thousands of civilians congregated at Rabin Square as a symbol of their allegiance to national unity. Shilon called for citizens to place their political views aside and instead demonstrate the unity of Israel. In March 2017, Shilon joined the \\"Pnima\\" movement whose vision is to create a shared identity and advocate for solidarity in Israeli society. Among its founders are Rabbi Shay Piron and the former IDF Chiefs of Staff, Benny Gantz and Gabi Ashkenazi. = Business activity = In February 2017, Shilon, along with his trusted partners, established \\"OurGoods,\\" a platform that connects manufacturers of diverse and unique goods to consumers. In February 2018, Shilon was selected to be one of the Forbes 30 Under 30 list. upright During the years 2018‚Äì2020, his contribution to the unique development of Microsoft, Xbox, was published. A gaming remote for players with disabilities was launched for the first time in history, allowing greater accessibility to a new world of content, which was an obscure concept at the time. The specialized gaming remote was presented on the \\"Most Respected List, within the ‚ÄúTen Most Important Developments in the Last Decade\\" by the Time Magazine. Shilon joined as a consultant and shareholder in another company targeting the operations of disabilities control, \\"6Degrees,\\" in which an Israeli team develops algorithms that enable the control in smart devices without the use of touch, benefitting those affected with limited motor skills. The company has won international competitions and collaborates with rehabilitation hospitals in the development of solutions within the field. Shilon serves as a consultant and shareholder in a number of high-tech companies and as a partner in various social ventures and organizations that promote Israel globally. = In the Field of Sports = In 2015, 3 years after his injury, Shilon completed the 42.2 km Berlin Marathon. Since then, he has finished dozens of competitions and five marathons. In November 2018, after two years of training, Shilon became one of the few athletes to successfully complete the Iron Man competition, despite the physical disability of both his hands. The competition was held in Arizona, USA, where Shilon competed unrestrictedly alongside able-bodied athletes, crossing the finish line after 13 hours. = Lectures = In the first few months after his injury, Shilon began talking to teenagers and students about his story. In his lectures, Shilon emphasizes personal empowerment, coping in extreme situations, tools for dealing with life- altering challenges, the ability to use personal challenges in the development of solutions and more. Shilon has lectured to a variety of audiences, and has delivered his message at events throughout Israel and other countries. Majority of his speeches throughout the US and Europe were dedicated to fundraising for the benefit and well-being of the IDF soldiers, areas related to the medical field, such as Magen David Adom, rehabilitation centers, blood collection centers and more. = Communication and writing activities = Shilon's rehabilitation process was accompanied by journalists and broadcast on Channel 10. He was interviewed on various media outlets about a number of economic, social and personal issues, such as the importance of public support for IDF soldiers and IDF commanders, cooperative economics, social norms and raising awareness of albinism as a result of the same disability that his eldest child acquired. Additionally, Shilon commonly publishes content in collaboration with the newspaper, Yedioth Achronoth. He also creates personal content such as written columns and video articles in multiple social media platforms. In 2015, he was named Man of the Year. In 2017, he wrote a poem in memory of his friend, Major Yochai Kalangala, who was killed in the confrontation against Hezbollah during operational activities at Shebaa farms. He did so alongside singer and author, Yair Levy, who composed the song, \\"Get Kadima,\\" after the dissemination gained a large number of responses.

She is an Associate Professor of Oncology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Breast Cancer Scientific Liaison at the U.S. Food & Drug Administration. Early life and education Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Prowell wished to pursue a career in literature and writing stating she \\"had no intention of going to medical school.\\" Her father was a federal employee working for the U.S. Geological Survey and her mother a homemaker. She attended Parkview High School for her secondary school education. While completing her Bachelor of Arts degree in literature at Bard College, she was encouraged by her academic advisor, Clark Rodewald, to pursue a medical career. Although she was scheduled to attend a semester abroad at the Charles University in Prague during her junior year, she canceled her plans and worked with the science department to complete the various courses needed for her MCAT and medical school applications. She studied alongside Rodewald and translator William Weaver to complete her literature thesis, a translation from French to English of Gerard de Nerval's Voyage en Orient. Prowell later reflected that her mother's lymphoma diagnosis shortly after she left for college contributed to her pursuit of a career in oncology. After a year working with Nobel laureate D. Carleton Gajdusek in his NIH Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies, where she conducted basic science research in spongiform encephalopathies and served as the editor of several years of Gajdusek's personal diaries housed in the National Library of Medicine, she was accepted into the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She graduated in 1999 with a medical degree and election to the Phi Beta Kappa and Alpha Omega Alpha honor societies. During her final year of residency, she married Dr. Todd Gleeson, an HIV specialist. They had their first of three children together in 2004. Prowell was the recipient of an American Society of Clinical Oncology Young Investigator Award and two Pearl M. Stetler awards for women in medicine. Career Prowell was hired by Richard Pazdur in 2006 to join the faculty of oncology at Johns Hopkins University and serve as a medical officer and breast cancer scientific liaison to the Oncology Center of Excellence at the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA). In order to balance her joint appointments, Prowell worked part-time for the FDA while continuing to serve patients at Johns Hopkins. She later played an important role in developing FDA‚Äôs policy on accelerated approval using pathological complete response as a novel regulatory endpoint in the neoadjuvant high-risk breast cancer setting. The two articles were Residual Disease after Neoadjuvant Therapy ‚Äî Developing Drugs for High-Risk Early Breast Cancer and Pathological Complete Response and Accelerated Drug Approval in Early Breast Cancer. By 2012, Prowell and Pazdur co-published new FDA guidelines which would allow non-approved drugs to be tested on highly aggressive types of breast cancer before women underwent surgery, with the disappearance of all cancer after treatment in the pathological specimen, known as pathological compete response, to be used as a potential basis for regulatory approval. In 2016, she was appointed by Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee to the Biden Cancer Moonshot Blue Ribbon Panel Cancer Immunology Working Group. Prowell has been an advocate for respectful language in medicine. She and Don Dizon called upon the field of medicine to abandon language that dehumanizes patients. She stated the aim of the language changes was to remind colleagues that patients and trial participants should be considered partners in research and clinical care, and to demonstrate respect to patients: \\"if we believe that we are making some exceptional allowance to not hurt patients' feelings, well, we should.\\" While serving as Chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's 2020 Annual Meeting Education Committee, Prowell co-authored The Language of Respect document intended to address these issues as well as mitigate unconscious gender and racial bias in speaker introductions at conferences. In 2019, she received the John and Samuel Bard Award in Science or Medicine for her contributions to the field of oncology. Prowell rose to prominence on Twitter during the COVID-19 pandemic as a reliable source of medical news and public health commentary. In March 2020, she tweeted a call to action seeking a convalescent plasma donor for her brother-in-law‚Äôs father, a physician who was critically ill with COVID-19. The tweet led to an outpouring of messages from thousands of prospective convalescent plasma donors, as well as others also seeking plasma for their own family members. Prowell worked to connect potential donors and recipients to donation centers throughout the U.S. before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Red Cross set up a convalescent plasma donation program. By April 10, 2020, The Atlantic journalist Sarah Zhang reported that 20,000 potential donors reached out to Mount Sinai Hospital. Her tweet and subsequent efforts earned her a Webby Special Achievement in May 2020 for \\"her use of the Internet to organize a blood drive and to inspire COVID-19 survivors to donate their plasma to those still in the fight to recover.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:American oncologists Category:Bard College alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Johns Hopkins University faculty Category:People from Atlanta ","title":"Tatiana Prowell"},{"id":"64162133","text":"Karl Van Schoor (1925 ‚Äì unknown) was a Belgian chess player, Belgian Chess Championship winner (1970).

Biography Buhagiar was born to a family of immigrants from Malta on 19 November 1846 in Cephalonia, Greece. He joined the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin in Malta on 20 December 1863 and was ordained a priest on 18 September 1869. In 1872 he began twelve years of pastoral work as a missionary in Sfax, Tunisia. He survived the July 1881 siege of Sfax, when the city revolted against the establishment of the French protectorate in Tunisia.

He received his episcopal consecration on 31 August 1884 from Charles-Martial-Allemand Lavigerie, Archbishop of Algiers. He became auxiliary bishop in November 1884 when the vicariate became the Archdiocese of Carthage with Archbishop Lavigerie at its head. On 14 April 1885, Pope Leo named him Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Malta, with the consent of the British officials governing Malta who conveyed Buhagiar to Valletta aboard the British warship HMS Helicon.

The only known species is Rugarhynchos sixmilensis. It was originally described as a species of Doswellia in 2012, before receiving its own genus in 2020. Rugarhynchos was a close relative of Doswellia and shared several features with it, such as the absence of an infratemporal fenestra and heavily textured skull bones. However, it could also be distinguished by many unique characteristics, such as a thick diagonal ridge on the side of the snout, blunt spikes on its osteoderms, and a complex suture between the quadratojugal, squamosal, and jugal. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and tooth morphology suggest that Rugarhynchos had a general skull anatomy convergent with some crocodyliforms, spinosaurids, and phytosaurs (particularly Smilosuchus). However, its snout was somewhat less elongated than those other reptiles.  Discovery  The only known specimen of Rugarhynchos is NMMNH P-16909, a partial skeleton consisting of several bones scattered over a small area. The largest component is a mostly complete right side of a skull. It was originally described as pertaining to part of the snout, until further preparation revealed that it included most of the skull. Other cranial fragments include a right quadrate, left premaxilla, left maxillary fragments, and a partial right quadratojugal which was originally considered another maxillary fragment. A fragment originally described as an articulated parietal and postorbital was later considered part of the palate. The only preserved portion of the jaw is a left surangular, although a large right pterygoid fragment was originally considered an articular. Postcranial remains include 13 osteoderms, several vertebral fragments, a few isolated rib fragments, the lower end of a left femur, and a possible pelvic fragment which was originally described as a calcaneum. These fossils were found at Six Mile Canyon in McKinley County, New Mexico. They were recovered from a massive purple mudstone layer of the lower Bluewater Creek Formation, also known as the Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation. Other fossils from Six Mile Canyon include fragments of aetosaurs, phytosaurs, and metoposaurids. The top of the Bluewater Creek Member was separated from overlying strata by a distinct tuffaceous sandstone layer (the \\"SMC bed\\") at Six Mile Canyon. The age of the SMC bed has been estimated by several studies involving various Uranium-Lead dating techniques. A 2009 conference abstract argued that it was 219.3 ¬± 3.1 or 220.9 ¬± 0.6 million years old based on Laser Ablation‚ÄìInductively Coupled Plasma‚ÄìMass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and Isotope Dilution-Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ID-TIMS) dating techniques, respectively. A 2011 study instead found a slightly younger date of 218.1 ¬± 0.7 Ma based on Chemical Abrasion‚ÄìThermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CA- TIMS) dating. These estimates suggest that the rocks which preserved Rugarhynchos were deposited in the vicinity of 220 Ma. The specimen was first described in 2012 as a new species of the armored archosauriform Doswellia. It was given the specific name Doswellia sixmilensis, in reference to its site of discovery. Its original describers noted that there was relatively little overlap between Doswellia sixmilensis and Doswellia kaltenbachi (the original species of Doswellia). They suggested that new material may lead to the two species being distinguished as two genera. Further preparation altered several interpretations of the specimen. The most notable of these was the discovery that the purported snout fragment was actually almost an entire skull. A 2020 study followed these new interpretations, describing how \\"Doswellia sixmilensis\\" had numerous unique features contrasting with Doswellia kaltenbachi. \\"D. sixmilensis\\" was placed into its own genus. The genus name is derived from Latin words for \\"wrinkle\\" and \\"nose\\", in reference to the wide variety of rough ridges on its snout.  Description  Skull = The front of the premaxilla expands to the side, forming a bulbous structure similar to that of many phytosaurs. It possessed eight teeth, with the first four being much larger than the last four. Premaxillary teeth were conical and ornamented by longitudinal ridges, but lacked serrations or cutting edges. The tooth row was slightly downturned at an angle of 15-20 degrees. Unlike other proterochampsians, the nares (nostril holes) did not seem to be oriented upwards. The rear branch of the premaxilla wedges into an extensive suture between the nasal and maxilla. There were 20 teeth in the maxillary tooth row, significantly more than in the maxillae of proterochampsids but in line with other doswelliids. Four enlarged teeth in the front half of the tooth row are covered by a convex extension, giving the maxilla a sigmoid lower edge akin to that of \\"robust-morph\\" phytosaurs. The maxillary teeth of Rugarhynchos had negligible curvature and were similar to the premaxillary teeth. The nasal is roughly textured, hosting a prominent ridge along the midline of the skull along with several other low ridges. The rear of the nasals are incised by the triangular front edge of the frontals, creating a wedge-shaped suture also seen in Proterochampsa. The prefrontal and lacrimal form the front edge of the orbit (eye socket) and connect to the maxilla. Like other proterochampsians, there is no contact between the lacrimal and nasal. More unusually, there is also no trace of an antorbital fenestra between the maxilla, nasal, and lacrimal. The only other early archosauriform known to lack an antorbital fenestra is Vancleavea. One autapomorphy (unique distinguishing feature) of Rugarhynchos is the presence of a thick diagonal ridge on the side of the snout. This ridge extends from the upper part of the maxilla onto the lacrimal, prefrontal, and frontal. Chanaresuchus and Proterochampsa have a similar ridge in front of the orbit, though it is less pronounced and does not extend onto the maxilla. Various smaller ridges and rough spots are present near the large diagonal ridge of Rugarhynchos. These include a raised, bulbous rim of the orbit, a thin horizontal ridge on the prefrontal, and a thicker ridge along the prefrontal-frontal suture. The upper edge of the orbit also has a prominent raised boss formed by the frontal. Behind and below the orbit lies the very large and blocky jugal. It is textured by prominent bumps, ridges, and pits, though these features are less pronounced than those of Doswellia. The overlying squamosal was also simple in shape and textured by long ridges and depressions. Its front edge formed the rear rim of a supratemporal fenestra, a hole in the upper part of the skull behind the orbits. The rear part of the squamosal connected to the quadrate and had a triangular horn-like structure similar to that of Doswellia. The postorbital is missing in the fossil, but its position relative to other bones can be inferred by the space it left behind. It would have been tightly connected to the jugal, squamosal, and frontal, leaving no space for an infratemporal fenestra. This gives Rugarhynchos a euryapsid skull akin to Doswellia. The rear edge of the skull is formed by the quadratojugal, which connects to the rest of the skull in several unique ways. The upper part of the quadratojugal edges a shallow concave area formed by the rear edge of the squamosal and jugal. The lower part of the quadratojugal fits into a prominent notch on the jugal. Both of these traits are autapomorphies of Rugarhynchos. The quadrate is steeply angled to the rest of the skull (like Chanaresuchus and Doswellia) and also has a large, hooked upper portion (like Vancleavea and allokotosaurians). The middle of the pterygoid had a diagonal ridge with two rows of teeth stretching along its underside. This is intermediate between proterochampsids (which have one row of teeth on their pterygoid ridge) and Doswellia (which has at least three). A different ridge along the inner edge of the pterygoid also hosts a longitudinal row of teeth. A few teeth are randomly distributed between the two ridges, though there were likely many more originally present. A possible palatine bone is also preserved. This bone has a crescent-shaped front half and a saddle-shaped rear half. This is similar to Proterochampsa and Chanaresuchus, though insufficient data on basal archosauriform palates prevents comparison to many other taxa. The only preserved jaw bone is a large surangular which is textured by rough longitudinal ridges. It is generally similar to that of Doswellia, though its upper edge is not convex and its front tip is blunt and rounded. Unique to Rugarhynchos, there is a cup-shaped depression on the rear edge of the surangular below where it connects to the articular bone. = Postcrania = Postcranial material of Rugarhynchos is sparse. Several fragmentary or complete centra (main vertebral components) were among the fossils recovered. These centra were low and wide, similar to other doswelliids, Vancleavea, and Litorosuchus, but unlike proterochampsids. Low, elliptical rib facets were located on short stalks. Other doswelliids had similarly shaped rib facets though set on longer stalks. Like most other reptiles, Rugarhynchos would have had two rib facets on either side of a vertebra. The upper facets are termed diapophyses and connected to the upper rib head (tuberculum), while the lower facets are parapophyses and connected to the lower rib head (capitulum). No diapophyses are preserved, but large parapophyses were present close to the lower edge of the centrum. The capitulum and tuberculum of preserved ribs were closely set and cylindrical, as in Doswellia. The vertebrae were likely cervicals (neck vertebrae) due to having low-set parapophyses and prominent midline keels along their lower edge. Prominent excavations on the side of the vertebrae gave them an X-shaped cross-section when seen from above. The centra were rectangular from the side and would have connected with each other on an even level, indicating that the neck was straight. A thick, curved bone fragment likely represents the upper part of a hip bone such as the pubis or ischium, though its identity cannot be determined precisely. A portion of the femur near the knee is the only fragment of the leg preserved in Rugarhynchos. Like other proterochampsians, this part of the femur was wide and had a subtle concavity on its front edge. The distal condyles were well-differentiated and both were slightly tapered. Although a pointed medial condyle is common to basal archosauriforms and pseudosuchians, a pointed lateral condyle is only observed in Gualosuchus among eucrocopodans. Many osteoderms (bony plates) have been preserved. They were roughly square-shaped and ornamented by large circular pits which radiated from the center of each plate, like other doswelliids. Also in line with doswelliids, the osteoderms articulate with each other via a smooth and flat front edge rather than spines or notches. However, several traits of Rugarhynchos's osteoderms differ from other doswelliids. The pits are shallower and the upper surface of the osteoderm has a central blunt spike-like eminence rather than a raised keel. None of the osteoderms fossilized in articulation, so it is uncertain how they were arranged on the body. Nevertheless, Rugarhynchos likely had multiple longitudinal rows (columns) of osteoderms, as with other doswelliids. More irregularly shaped osteoderms near the skull may have connected to form a \\"nuchal shield\\" similar to that of Doswellia.  Classification  To test its relations to other early archosauriforms, Rugarhynchos was placed into a phylogenetic analysis derived from an earlier study by Ezcurra et al. (2017). This analysis was run under both maximum parsimony and bayesian search protocols. The parsimony analysis placed Rugarhynchos as a doswelliid and the sister taxon to Doswellia. Doswelliids were the sister taxa to a monophyletic Proterochampsidae, and the Doswelliidae+Proterochampsidae clade was itself sister to a clade comprising Vancleavea and Litorosuchus. All of these taxa cumulatively make up the group Proterochampsia. The bayesian analysis had a very similar result, but differed in one major way. Instead of having a clean break between proterochampsids and doswelliids, the bayesian analysis suggested that Proterochampsidae in its traditional form was paraphyletic rather than monophyletic. Proterochampsa was found as the sister taxon to doswelliids and separate from other proterochampsids. Though this novel result was unusual, it was considered more likely than the parsimony alternative because it accounted for variable rates of evolution. The results of the bayesian analysis are shown below:  References  Category:Proterochampsians Category:Chinle Formation Category:Late Triassic archosauriforms of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 2020 ","title":"Rugarhynchos"},{"id":"64162341","text":"Bernardo d'Almeida (born 6 August 1912, date of death unknown) was a Portuguese sailor.

The union was founded in 1872 as the North German Union of White Tanners, based in Berlin, and by the end of 1873, it had 630 members. In 1876 it became the General German White Tanners' Union, and in 1877, it relocated its headquarters to Altenberg. In 1892, the union became the Union of Leather Workers of Germany, hoping to recruit other workers in the trade, and the following year, the Central Union of Tanners and Leather Dressers merged in. Its journal, Der Gerber, became the journal of the merged union, changing its name in 1896 to the Lederarbeiter-Zeitung. This began a period of growth for the union, which by the end of 1896 had 4,222 members. In 1909, the Union of Glove Makers of Germany merged into the union. The union provided the leadership of the International Federation of Glovemakers, which the Leather Workers took over, in 1914 transforming it into the International Union of Leather Workers. In 1919, the union was a founding affiliate of the General German Trade Union Confederation. Membership of the union continued to grow, reaching 11,922 in 1909, and peaking at 48,139 in 1923. Membership fell during the Great Depression, and was 37,855 by 1928. In 1933, the union was banned by the Nazi government.

In a cooperative or competitive experience, players control a number of cannibals on a tropical island feeding tourists to their god. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch on 20 May 2020. Gameplay Players in Cannibal Cuisine each control one cannibal chef, and must collect vegetables, fruits and meat (from killing tourists) to combine into meals on cooking spits. There is one or more Hoochooboos in the level who will request different meals. Delivering correct meals score points for the players, while delivering the wrong meals will cause the Hoochooboo to throw fireballs at the players. Cannibal Cuisine was designed primarily as a cooperative experience for up to four players, but it also has a competitive multiplayer mode. In competitive multiplayer, two teams compete to score the most points by feeding their Hoochooboo food. It is possible to fight the other team to disrupt their efforts, with ingredients and tourists to be found in a shared area which both teams can access. The game can be played in singleplayer, local multiplayer, online multiplayer, or combined local and online multiplayer (with multiple players on one computer or Switch connecting to other players online). Reception The game has a Metacritic score of 61 for Nintendo Switch, and has not received enough reviews to qualify for a Metacritic rating on PC. Reviews generally considered the gameplay to be solid, but criticized the controls. Some reviewers found the cannibalism theme distasteful, with GameWatcher describing it as 'insensitive' and 'sensationalist'. In response to criticism of the controls, the developers released an update shortly after release on May 24, 2020.

The first volume was written by Adolphe Burdo (1849-1891) and subtitled De Zanzibar au Lac Tanganika. The second and third were written by Charles de Martrin-Donos (1857-1904) and subtitled Le Congo et ses affluents. The volumes were written to \\"popularize and glorify the civilizing African enterprise, and the Belgians who took part in it\\".\\"√† populariser et √† glorifier l‚Äôoeuvre de la civilisation africaine, ainsi que les Belges qui y ont particip√©\\". Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.151. Capturing elephants from Les Belges dans l'Afrique Centrale  Context  Pierre Maes was the editor of Les Belges dans l'Afrique Centrale and his publishing house was located in Brussels.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.145. Producing this travel account was his projectFettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.129. and he hired Adolphe Burdo and Charles de Martrin-Donos to write the volumes. He had two interests in publishing those travel books. Firstly, travel writing was a popular genre in the late nineteenth century and selling such books thus ensured economic profit. Secondly, Pierre Maes produced Les Belges dans l'Afrique Centrale with the propagandist aim of supporting L√©opold II's colonial project.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.151. Thus far, there has been no evidence enabling to link Maes to L√©opold II's or his agents' own propagandist efforts.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.146. It is therefore probable that Maes belongs to the group of individual colonial enthusiasts which saw an occasion for economic profit in the king's colonial project.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp.129,148. Additionally, the editor also published other books on central Africa. In 1886, he published translations in Dutch of Henry Morton Stanley's How I Found Livingstone (1873) and The Congo and the Founding of its Free State (1885).Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.141. Adolphe Burdo was born in Li√®ge in 1849 and died in Paris in 1891. He was a Belgian explorer and participated in the third exploration of the Congo.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.148. His writings contain other travel accounts such as B√©nou√© et Niger, voyage dans l'Afrique centrale. and reports for the Royal Geographical Society.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.149. Although he authored the first volume of Les Belges dans l'Afrique Centrale, he was replaced by Martrin-Donos in 1885 because Maes was not satisfied with Burdo's contribution. In the editor‚Äôs opinion, Burdo‚Äôs contribution did not achieve the propagandist goal of his project.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp.151. Consequently, the editor took the matter to court in March 1885 and Burdo was sentenced to pay a fine and edit his work. Charles de Martrin-Donos was recruited to finish the project.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp.151-153. The latter was born in 1857 in Narbonne and died in 1904. He was a French baron and authored about a dozen books such as Verlaine intime: r√©dig√© d'apr√®s les documents recueillis sur le roi des po√®tes par son ami et √©diteur, L√©on Vanier or L√©gendes et contes de Provence.Belgian National Archives  Content  Les Belges dans l'Afrique Centrale roughly covers the period between the 1876 Brussels Geographic Conference and the 1885 Berlin Conference.Burdo, A. & Martrin- Donos, de, C.

Palm tree from Les Belges dans l'Afrique centrale  Successive editions  From November 1884 to December 1885, Burdo's and Martrin-Donos' contributions were published in instalments. In 1886, they were issued as books for the first time.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp.131-132. In 1890, the volumes were edited a second time as books and instalments. Only the first volume was dated 1890 and their covers differed from the ones of 1884.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp.132-133. In 1893, the three volumes were published once again, both as books and instalments, under a new title as well as under a new and sole author name, L. Hubert.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, p.134. This last version was given a more spectacular name La Conqu√™te du Congo. Voyages √©mouvants & aventures dramatiques des explorateurs belges en Afrique. in an attempt to popularize the volumes. The first editions were aimed at an educated or intellectual audience whereas the last one was aimed at a more popular audience.Fettweis and Van Balberghe, 2006, p.136. The text of each volume was complemented by 150 to 200 illustrations, maps and engravings.Fettweis & Van Balberghe, 2006, pp. 129-134.  About plagiarism  In 2006, an academic article on Les Belges dans L'Afrique Centrale was published in the Annales Aequotoria.

Founded by lesbian activist Selli Engler, Die BIF was part of the first wave of lesbian publications in history and the world's first lesbian magazine to be published, edited and written solely by women.  Publication dates Die BIF was founded, edited and published by Selli Engler, who afterwards became one of the most renowned lesbian activists of Weimar Germany. It was one of three lesbian magazines of the time beside Die Freundin (since 1924) and Frauenliebe (since 1926). Among them Die BIF was unique, as both other magazines were published, edited and even partly written by men. According to the imprint it was located at Gro√übeerenstra√üe 74 III in Kreuzberg. Engler acted as publisher, editor and writer but, as a result of financial difficulties and illness, had to delay publishing twice. Die BIF was printed at Mitsching's Buchdruckerei in Berlin, its circulation is unknown. The 1927 issues were distributed by the GroBuZ company in Berlin. Advertising offices were available in many large towns in Germany, including Dresden, Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart and Duisburg. Only three issues are known to have been published: Issue No. 1 (date unknown) and Issues No. 2 (January 1927) and No. 3 (early 1927). The only known originals belong to the collection of the German National Library in Leipzig, Engler herself submitted them in November 1927. Copies can be found in the special libraries , Schwules Museum and in Berlin and at the library of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. The exact dates of publication of Die BIF are still unknown, as the first and the last issues contain no information on when exactly they were published. For many years researchers suggested either 1924 or 1926 as possible dates for the first issue. As 1924 has since been discounted, publication is believed to have started either in 1925 or more likely 1926. Engler discontinued Die BIF in early 1927 and started writing in July for the competing magazine Frauenliebe. Die BIF had 24 pages and was released as a monthly magazine on the first of the month, sold on news booths at a price of 1 Mark, a relatively high price, as well as by subscription. In Issue No. 3, \\"on request\\" of readers Engler announced a lower price for a reduced number of pages, down to 50 Pfennig for 12 pages. As a spring-off to the magazine, on January 1, 1927, Engler started the \\"Damen-BIF-Klub\\" (Ladies BIF Club), an opportunity for lesbian women to meet once a week.  Authors and contents  Die BIF published mainly literary works such as fictional prose and poems along with an occasional historical or analytical article on lesbianism, discussing social and work life, fashion and lesbian identity. Engler's intention was to offer a magazine with a standard higher than that of its competitors, which Engler considered to be inadequate. Nevertheless, in 2016 Claudia Schoppmann referred to Die BIF as \\"a monthly magazine with a low literary standard\\". In contrast to Freundin and Frauenliebe, Die BIF refrained from reporting on Berlin's contemporary lesbian social life. All original content of Die BIF was written by women. While many articles were written by Engler herself, other noticeable writers included Olga L√ºdeke and Ilse Espe. All in all, there were at least ten contributors, five of whom later went on‚Äîalong with Engler‚Äîto write for Frauenliebe. In addition to their articles, there were occasionally excerpts of works by men, selected by the publisher for their interest to readers, for example snippets from Alexandre Dumas, Magnus Hirschfeld or Otto Weininger.  Legacy  Only few contemporary comments on Die BIF are known. Franz Scott wrote in 1933, that Die BIF has been launching \\"excellent artistic and literary contributions\\", which in accordance with its standards made Die BIF superior to Freundin and Frauenliebe and stated that it failed because the target group was undemanding. Scott's comparison has been heavily criticized by in 2015 as biased, contradictory and one-sided. In 1927, Magnus Hirschfeld took a photograph that shows two issues of Die BIF from the archive of the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft, among other gay papers. In 1938 the Nazi jurist Rudolf Klare mentioned Die BIF in his article \\"Zum Problem der weiblichen Homosexualit√§t\\" (On the problem of female homosexuality) as an example of the \\"abundant press\\" by \\"organisations of female homosexuals\\" of the 1920s in Germany. After being forgotten for decades, Die BIF was rediscovered by Katharina Vogel and Claudia Schoppmann in 1984 as part of basic work on Engler's biography, punctually extended by Schoppmann (1997), Jens Dobler (2003) and Heike Schader (2004). Some more in-depth work followed in 2020, though a thorough analysis of the BIF contents is still missing. Since the rediscovery of Selli Engler and Die BIF, German and international researchers acknowledge its pioneering role as the first lesbian magazine run by women (and the only one until Vice Versa was published in 1947). Florence Tamagne highlighted this as Die BIF's \\"unique quality\\".

Then, following his father steps, he joined the Wesleyan Methodist Church In 1867, the year of the Canadian Confederation, he was ordained on 9 June, and married to Elizabeth Bingham on 25 December.Brown (1994) In January 1868, Young was invited to become a missionary to natives of Rupert‚Äôs Land.Brown (2014), p.3 With his wife they decided to go on that journey, on 11 May 1868 they left for Red River, Manitoba to settle in Norway House. In January 1869, Young started his mission work among the Cree at Nelson House, where in June, Egerton Ryerson Junior, called Eddie, the Youngs‚Äô first son was born.Brown (2014), p.10 During his time at Nelson House, Young visited the Saulteaux of Berens River, and in 1873 he was assigned to develop a mission there.

Pearse‚Äôs objective, as he wrote in By canoe and dog-train‚Äôs introduction, is ‚Äúrenewing the popular interest in foreign missionary enterprise‚Äù.Pearse in Young (1890), p.xv In 1888, Young gave lectures about mission life in the East of United States, British Isles and important cities in North America. In 1890, Young published his first book: By canoe and dog train among the Cree ad Salteaux.

The 16 m tall sculpture in architecture is made of wood and stainless steel. The sculpture was commissioned for the newly built extension at the school. Kristek co-operated with the architect Kergel. The staircase wraps around the sculpture of a tree with symbolic fruit. The core of the sculpture is made of wood and covered with strips of steel. Rocks on the ground represent the soil as a growth medium. The seven metal spheres hang on the tree branches representing fruits that bear wooden reliefs symbolizing arts, sciences and eros. Next to the tree, in the basement, there stands a larger-than-life-sized figure of a man who looks up to the fruits. The sculpture ends up in the skylight with sun and planets. The piece refers to the missionary and astronomer Ignaz K√∂gler whose name bears the school in which the sculpture is located. Kristek noted that K√∂gler enriched foreign cultural environment and that is the reason why the sculpture is \\"rooted in the native soil\\" and \\"rises to all the heights of human spirit.\\" According to the art historian Hartfrid Neunzert, the mission of this artwork is to incite the students to assume consciously their place in education and to learn to think independently. Walter Etschmann wrote that the artwork gave a new meaning to the staircase that can now be understood as a symbol of the journey towards knowledge with the light at the end (represented by the light cone).

History In April 1757, Spanish explorer Don Francisco Maria Celi documented a trip into Tampa Bay and up the Hillsborough River. Celi's expedition came to Tampa Bay from Cuba. The party he led up the Hillsborough River was seeking pine trees suitable for use as masts on his ships. The expedition was for the Spanish Royal Navy. Celi reportedly erected a cross at a site he named el Pinal de la Cruz de Santa Teresa (the Pine Forest of the Cross of Saint Theresa). The site is now part of Riverhills Park in Temple Terrace, Florida. He continued upriver as far as the rapids that are now part of Hillsborough River State Park.

The first international links between glovemakers' unions came about in 1871, when the unions from France, Austria, Denmark and Sweden met in Germany, and this led the unions based in Germany and Vienna to begin international co-operation, soon joined by the Scandinavian unions, and one based in Prague. This was sometimes described as the first international trade secretariat, but no central office or leadership was established. In 1891, at a conference in Brussels, the International Federation of Glovemakers was established. This included affiliates from Germany, Norway and Sweden, and local unions from Brussels, Copenhagen, Genoa, Grenoble, J√°chymov, Kada≈à, Luxembourg, Milan, Naples, Paris, Prague and Vienna. However, all combined, they represented only 4,089 workers. Despite this, the federation survived, organising congresses in Grenoble in 1893, Paris in 1895, Zurich in 1898, and Stuttgart in 1904. Its headquarters were initially in Brussels, and from 1892 it published a journal in French, Gantier. In 1904, it moved its headquarters to Berlin, home of its largest affiliate. In 1914, it decided to admit unions representing tanners, and so renamed itself as the \\"International Union of Leather Workers\\". However, it lost most of its affiliates, and by 1921, it only had members from Austria, Denmark, Germany and Luxembourg.

Sepulveda Blvd., in Westchester, Los Angeles, designed by architect Victor Gruen. Its original design was considered a landmark in exterior architecture of retail stores, although much of the original design is no longer present. The building now houses a Kohl's. Background Originally, in 1942, Frank Ayres & Son, developers were commissioned to create a healthy business district along Sepulveda in the new Westchester community. They tried to lure J. C. Penney as an anchor, but Penney's felt the area was too close to Downtown Inglewood. They succeeded in attracting Milliron's, the first branch of Milliron's department store (long known as the Fifth Street Store), which had its flagship store on Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, then still the city's main retail district lined with large department stores and cinemas. However Milliron's did not have the drawing power of a Bullock's, Broadway or J. W. Robinson's. Significance Victor Gruen, an Austrian-born architect, who would later design the country's first enclosed mall, Southdale Center, and greatly influence the design of the American shopping mall, emigrated to the U.S. in 1938 and made a name for himself designing retail stores in New York City, such as Ciro's on Fifth Avenue and Barton's Bonbonniere on Broadway. In 1941 he began extensive work in Los Angeles designing branches of Grayson‚Äôs Ladies Ready to Wear on Hollywood Boulevard, Crenshaw Boulevard and Third Street. In 1949 he designed Milliron's Westchester, Westchester was a fast-growing suburban district on the city's Westside. The grand opening on March 17, 1949 was a \\"huge event that showcased the elegance and efficiency of postwar Modernism\\", according to the Los Angeles Conservancy. Millron's Westchester was considered strikingly innovative when it opened in 1949, in terms of both it attractive Late Moderne design and in being a suburban (but freestanding) department store, which was still relatively new. In the following years, department stores did expand to the Los Angeles suburbs. But only a few years after opening, by the mid-1950s it would be regarded as behind the times: * the scale as small and relatively ordinary, compared to the larger, complete shopping malls then starting to open, such as Broadway- Crenshaw Center in 1947 * facing the street and attempting to be visually appealing to automobile traffic, when new shopping centers were creating insular environments * freestanding department stores were already seen as the exception rather than the rule ‚Äì Architectural Forum declared in 1950 that the \\"isolated branch store in the suburbs is headed for serious trouble\\". Nonetheless, Milliron's was an important reference for Gruen's future career. Because it was a department store and not just a smaller specialty store, his work was exposed at a national level, and Gruen would go on to become the most renowned architect of the American enclosed mall. Architectural details Although the building is not listed, the National Register of Historic Places registration form for Bullock's Pasadena references it and describes it as Late Moderne style, \\"a one-story department store, it also integrated parking lots into the plan, and added roof-top parking accessible via two criss- crossed ramps at the rear of the building. Faced with unpainted brick, its facade displays regular bays marked by structural fins creating a flat- canopied loggia above the roofline. This system circumscribes the building, sweeping down to form a modernistic arch over the rear entries to the rooftop parking ramps. Though it was windowless, Milliron's provided four freestanding display kiosks for window displays along the sidewalk side.\\" =Height= Milliron's design aimed to house \\"five stories' worth of department store within one story\\", despite the store being only in size. The restaurant, beauty parlor and auditorium were located on the roof and elevated the main fa√ßade to a height of 30 feet. An elevation wrapped around the secondary fa√ßade and screened a rooftop parking deck and stair towers from view at ground level and vertical concrete fins accentuated the apparent height, which from all main angles appeared to be that of a two-story building. =Parking= An unusual feature was a rooftop parking lot for 300 cars. Dramatic ramps that were designed with straight lines but with some slightly diagonal lines, and with curves at the angles, led cars up to the roof. Escalators led down into the store from the roof. Epilogue The shopping district around Milliron's area remained sparse for the first few years. The store was sold in June 1950 to The Broadway was then known as The Broadway- Westchester. Westchester never did take off as a regional shopping nexus, especially after the construction of the nearby Fox Hills Mall. Broadway closed its Westchester branch in late 1990. The building later housed a branch of Mervyns and is currently a branch of Kohl's. External links *M.

Rudolph studied at CalTech and Stanford and taught post-graduate mathematics at Stanford University, the University of Maryland and Colorado State University, being appointed to the Albert C. Yates Endowed Chair in Mathematics at Colorado State in 2005. Rudolph jointly developed a theory of restricted orbit equivalence which unified several other theories into a single framework. He founded and directed an intense preparation course for graduate studies in mathematics and began a Math circle for middle school children. Early in life he was a modern dancer. He died in 2010 from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative motor neuron disease. Early life and education  Rudolph was born to William Franklin Rudolph (1922-2000) and Betty Johnalou Waldner (1921-2004) and was the middle of three sons, the others being Gregory and James. The family moved to Fort Collins when Daniel was very young. He attended Fort Collins High School where he was active in the Chemistry club, Physics club, Computer club and Flying club as well as being on the student council. Rudolph was a semi-finalist in the Westinghouse Science Talent Search. He graduated from Fort Collins High School in 1968 and matriculated at the California Institute of Technology. Rudolph attended CalTech on a Sloan Research Fellowship, and planned to major in theoretical physics. He soon changed his mind and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 1972. Before graduating he won Cal Tech's Bell Prize for Undergraduate Mathematics Research.  Career  Rudolph moved to Stanford University in 1972 where revolutionary work was being done on ergodic theory. He was awarded a Master of Science in 1973 and he completed his PhD under the supervision of Don Ornstein in 1975, with the title \\"Non-Bernoulli Behavior of the Roots of K-automorphisms\\". Rudolph's work in ergodic theory focused on measure theory as opposed to the functional analysis approach that dominated ergodic theory. His description of ergodic theory: From August 1975 to August 1976, Rudolph was a postdoctoral fellow at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During this time he devised a solution to a problem in ergodic theory that had resisted solutions by Ornstein and others, entitled \\"When are two-point extensions of Bernoulli shifts also Bernoulli shifts?\\". In so doing he devised the method of \\"nesting\\" which evolved into a powerful tool. He also began his studies into varieties of orbit equivalence. The Lorenz attractor, a visual interpretation of a dynamical system He became a fellow of the Miller Institute at U.C. Berkeley from late 1976 to 1978 and was appointed assistant professor at Stanford University from 1978 to 1981. He spent part of 1979 at the University of Maryland where he studied dynamics. While at Maryland he lived at \\"Ergodic House\\" along with Bruce Kitchens, Brian Marcus and Laif Swanson and they were regularly visited by Doug Lind and Andres del Junco. In 1981 Rudolph was appointed associate professor at the University of Maryland and was awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship. This is also where he became recognised as a world leader in ergodic theory. He was appointed professor of mathematics in 1985 and was at Maryland until 2004, during which time he was chair of the graduate program and acting chair of the Department of Mathematics. In collaboration with Janet Kammeyer and others, Rudolph developed a theory of restricted orbit equivalence which unified Ornstein‚Äôs Bernoulli theory, Dye‚Äôs theorem, Kakutani equivalence, and other relations into a single framework. Rudolph spent some time away from Maryland and was a Visiting Professor at several universities including: the Pierre and Marie Curie University in 1988; the Mathematics Institute of the University of Warwick and the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ in 1989; the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1991; the Universit√© d'Aix-Marseille in 1993; and the Universit√© de Fran√ßois Rabelais in Tours in 1993. Rudolph presented several lectures including at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing in 2002 entitled \\"Applications of orbit equivalence to actions of discrete amenable groups.\\" Rudolph and his family moved to his old home-town Fort Collins in 2005 where he was appointed to the Albert C. Yates Endowed Chair in Mathematics at Colorado State University. Here he was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative motor neuron disease. Rudolph founded and directed the SPIRAL program at Maryland, which was an intensive six-week preparation for graduate studies in mathematical sciences. This program was acknowledged by the American Mathematical Society with an award for \\"Mathematics Programs That Make a Difference\\" in 2008. As the disease progressed some physical activities became impossible but he continued to teach and do some departmental work, including supervising PhD students. Rudolph began a Math circle for middle school girls with the assistance of a middle school teacher, Martha Cranor. This was later expanded to a summer Math Circles camp, for middle school girls and boys. Rudolph died February 4, 2010 from complications resulting from the ALS. The April 2012 volume of the journal Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems (Vol 32, Part 2) was dedicated to him. One of his last papers was a joint work with Benjamin Weiss and Matthew Foreman in the journal Annals of Mathematics on the conjugacy equivalence relation of automorphisms.  Selected publications  Rudolph authored or co-authored more than 70 articles in the field of ergodic theory, including:  * * He also authored two books: * *  Personal Life  Before he got married, Rudolph had taken dance classes at as a CalTech undergraduate and at Maryland modern dancing became a serious hobby for him, after being inspired by dance innovator Alvin Mayes. In 1991, Mayes choreographed a duet \\"For Bill and Johnalou\\", dedicated to Rudolph's parents. In 1991 Rudolph married Michelle Hyde and they had three children, Beatrice, Jonah and Layton. \\"Rudolph was devoted to his children and evenings became a precious time to be spent with the children - no longer with friends or dance.\\" In November 1981 Rudolph's older brother Gregory, Gregory's wife Kristin and their two children died in a plane crash. The plane had been piloted by Gregory and had crashed while attempting to land at Cedar City Airport. Rudolph was considered dynamic, inspiring and generally positive. For a while he kept a sign in his Maryland office that read \\"Eat problems for breakfast\\". His academic papers were considered difficult to read but in- person he expressed ideas elegantly. His students remembered him as \\"demanding but very supportive\\".

He is a member of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and the president of party's Delhi unit. Starting his political career as a twelfth-grade student when he joined the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, he remained active in student politics when he attended Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University. His association with the Ram Mandir Movement led to his arrest and he was imprisoned for a year at Kanpur in 1991. He joined the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha when he moved to Delhi from his home district of Kannauj in 1994. He campaigned in the 2017 Municipal Corporation of Delhi election successfully from the West Patel Nagar ward and became the Mayor of North Delhi Municipal Corporation in April 2018, remaining in office till 29 April 2019. He was appointed president of Delhi BJP on 2 June 2020 by the National President of the BJP, Jagat Prakash Nadda, following the resignation of Manoj Tiwari.  Personal life  Gupta was born in 1969, the eldest son of Shambhu Dayal Gupta, in Gursahaiganj, Kannauj (formerly a part of Farrukhabad district and now in Kannauj district), Uttar Pradesh. He received his twelfth-grade Higher Secondary School Certificate from Madan Mohan Malviya Inter College in 1987. He later attended Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University at Kanpur and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree. After completing his higher education, he moved to Delhi in 1994 and started tutoring to make his living in the city. After working as a tuition teacher for two years he established his own business. However, his business was not successful and he returned to the teaching profession. After tutoring for few more years he applied for the position of contractor with the Central Public Works Department and acquired considerable success in this profession.  Political career  Gupta is a member of the Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) and is active in the politics of Delhi. He embarked on a career in politics after becoming a member of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) during his time in the Madan Mohan Malviya Inter College as a twelfth-grade student in 1987. His involvement in student politics continued at Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj University. He rose in the ABVP to become the head of its district unit and later secretary of the state unit. He actively participated in the Ram Janmabhoomi Movement and canvassed students for its support. The Ram Janmabhoomi Movement was spearheaded by the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to claim disputed land in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, hypothesised to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama, for Hindus. Gupta's association with the movement led to his arrest by police in 1991 and his incarceration at a temporary prison at Kanpur for a year. Gupta joined the Bharatiya Yuva Morcha and became its national office secretary in 1994 under the leadership of president Dharmendra Pradhan. He also held several positions in the BJP's Delhi unit from 2009 to 2014, becoming the West Patel Nagar Mandal President in 2009 and later the head of Najafgarh Mandal. In the 2017 Municipal Corporation of Delhi election, Gupta was given a BJP ticket to contest from the West Patel Nagar ward of the Karol Bagh Zone of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC). He won the election and in April 2018 became the Mayor of the NDMC. He was succeeded by Avtar Singh for the post of mayor on 29 April 2019. As a member of the NDMC, Gupta was elected unopposed as a member of the standing committee of the house on the same day he resigned as mayor. = Delhi BJP President = Gupta was appointed the president of the Delhi BJP on 2 June 2020 by the National President of the BJP, Jagat Prakash Nadda. He succeeded actor-politician and member of parliament Manoj Tiwari, who had tendered his resignation due to unsatisfactory performance of the party in the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election but had been asked by the party to remain in office until the new appointment to replace him. Gupta's appointment was viewed by multiple media sources as an attempt by the BJP to regain its traditional voters, including the Vaishya community to which Gupta belongs. After Gupta assumed the presidency, the Delhi BJP witnessed substantial changes in its organisational structure, including the commissioning of new presidents at the block and district level. The process was supposed to commence immediately after his appointment but it was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi. Gupta led a protest at Rajghat on 7 June 2020 along with other BJP leaders, including the Leader of Opposition of the Legislative Assembly of Delhi, Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, against the Government of Delhi, accusing the latter of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi. They were detained by police for violating lockdown norms and were taken to Rajendr Nagar Police Station. The BJP unit of Delhi launched a 'Jan Jagran Abhiyan' () about the COVID-19 pandemic under Gupta on 17 June 2020. The campaign included all the members of parliament from Delhi and other senior leaders of the party, and involved the distribution of decoction packets, sanitizer bottles, and face masks in different areas of the city. Gupta headed the Delhi contingent of the party in the 'Sewa Hi Sangathan' () virtual meeting of the BJP on 4 July 2020, which was attended by all of its regional units in the country and chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the presence of party national president Jagat Prakash Nadda. Gupta gave a presentation during the meeting and briefed the others about the different social works carried out by the party in Delhi under the 'Sewa Hi Sanathan' Campaign. These included COVID-19 relief measures and encouraging people to donate to the PM CARES Fund and its joint programme with Delhi Police, 'Anivarya', to distribute sanitary napkins among women and girls living in the slums of Delhi. Gupta also wrote to all three mayors of Delhi, including the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, and the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, asking them not to go ahead with their respective anti- encroachment drives planned to be carried out citywide against street vendors during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting its economic impact.

She was born of the Li family and lived most of her life in the city of Jiangyou (Ê±üÊ≤π) in the domain of Shu Han state. Lady Li is best known for her role in the Conquest of Shu by Wei (263-264), she faced Ma Miao (È¶¨ÈÇà), the governor of her city, who surrendered Jiangyou to Cao Wei state.(ÂÖàÁôªËá≥Ê±üÁî±ÔºåËúÄÂÆàÂ∞áÈ¶¨ÈÇàÈôç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. She ended up committing suicide to demonstrate loyalty to the Shu kingdom; she was later praised by Deng Ai, a general of Cao Wei.  In Romance of the Three Kingdoms  Her early life was not recorded in historical records. She married Ma Miao, governor of Jiangyou, a city located in Sichuan province. The most notable mentions about her were in the 14th century historical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticizes previous events and during the Three Kingdoms period of China. The novel introduces Lady Li in Chapter 117. Lady Li's husband, Ma Miao, was the governor of Jiangyou. During Conquest of Shu by Wei, he heard that the land of the east river had fallen into the enemy's hands. Although there was something prepared for the defense, his post had a large area to protect, and he was confident that Jiang Wei would defend the Saber Pass. Therefore, he did not take his military duties very seriously, just staying at home. In 263, when Deng Ai of Wei marched to Jiangyou, Ma Miao was treacherous and refused to lead the defense saying that it was up to Jiang Wei. When Lady Li heard about the state of affairs at the border, she said to the governor, \\"If there is so great danger on the borders, how is it you are so unaffected?\\". Ma Miao replied, \\"The affair is in Jiang Wei's hands and is not my concern\\". She then replied, \\"Nevertheless, you finally have to guard the capital, and that is a heavy responsibility.\\" Referring to the cowardice of the Emperor of Shu, Liu Shan, Ma Miao replied Lady Li saying: \\"O, well! The Emperor trusts his favorite Huang Hao entirely and is sunk in vice and pleasure. Disaster is very near. If the Wei armies get here, I shall yield. It is no good taking it seriously. \\" Filled with concern regarding the state of Shu, Lady Li tried by herself to raise the morale of the troops to defend the city. She insulted Ma Miao's treachery and reprimanded him for his complacency in protecting Jiangyou, saying: > \\"You call yourself a man! Have you such a disloyal and treacherous heart? Is > it nothing to have held office and taken pay for years? How can I bear to > look upon your face?\\". Ma Miao was rendered speechless by her harsh scolding. Just then Lady Li's house servants came to tell her that Deng Ai, with his two thousand troops, had found their way along some road and had already broken into the city. Ma Miao was now frightened and hastily went out to find the leader and offer his formal submission. He went to the Town Hall and bowed on the steps, crying, \\"I have long desired to come over to Wei. Now I yield myself and my army and all the town.\\" Deng Ai accepted Ma Miao's surrender and incorporated his army with his own force. He took Ma Miao into his service as guide to fight against Shu Han. Then came a servant with the news: \\"Lady Li has hanged herself!\\" In response to Deng Ai and his troops forcing Ma Miao to surrender, Lady Li hanged herself to demonstrate loyalty to the Shu Han. Upon learning her reasons for doing so, Deng Ai commended Lady Li's fealty and personally arranged her funeral. Lady Li's unexpected resistance and, consequently, suicide, impacted both armies; Deng Ai stopped the advance and dedicated himself to honoring her as a last heroine of the state Shu Han before conquering the capital Chengdu.(ÂÖàÁôªËá≥Ê±üÁî±ÔºåËúÄÂÆàÂ∞áÈ¶¨ÈÇàÈôç„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 28. A poem was made to praise her honorable conduct: : When the Ruler of Shu had wandered from the way, : And the House of Han fell lower, : Heaven sent Deng Ai to smite the land. : Then did a woman show herself most noble, : So noble in conduct, : That no leader equaled her. After the fall of Jiangyou, the capital of Shu Han Chengdu was taken over by the forces of Cao Wei, so Shu's emperor, Liu Shan, surrendered, thus ending the state of Shu Han.

She showed great promise as a two-year-old in 2019 when she won three of her four races including the Group 3 Prix Miesque. In the following year she ran second in the Prix de la Grotte before taking the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches. Background Dream And Do is a bay filly with a white star and snip bred in France by the Normandy-based Haras du Logis Saint Germain. As a yearling in August 2018 she was put up for auction at the Arqana Deauville sale but failed to reach her reserve price of $91,504. She was sent into training with Frederic Rossi at his base near Marseille and has been ridden in most of her races by Maxime Guyon. She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by the Aga Khan's stallion Siyouni whose biggest win came in the 2009 running of the Prix Jean-Luc Lagard√®re. His other offspring have included Sottsass, Laurens and Ervedya. Dream And Do's dam, Venetia's Dream, showed no racing ability earning as she failed to win in eight appearances on the track. She was a half-sister to the dam of Charm Spirit and a descendant of the Canadian broodmare Ciboulette, making her also a relative of L'Enjoleur, Fanfreluche, La Voyageuse and Holy Roman Emperor. Racing career2019: two-year-old season= Dream And Do made her racecourse debut in a maiden race over 1500 metres on good-to-soft ground at Deauville Racecourse on 6 August when she finished second of the seven runners, beaten one and a half lengths by the Andr√© Fabre-trained winner Savarin. On 9 September she was partnered by Sylvain Guis in a 1600-metre maiden at Marseille Borely and recorded her first success as she won by a length from Pomme d'Amour at odds of 0.8/1. The filly then started favourite for the Prix Esmeralda over 1400 metres on soft ground at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse on 1 October and won by two lengths and a head from Yomogi and Mageva. Four weeks after her win in the Prix Esmeralda, Dream And Do was stepped up in class for the Group 3 Prix Miesque over the same course and distance. She went off the 1.3/1 favourite in an eight-runner field which also included Mageva, Yomogi and the Listed race winners Les Hogues and Sopran Ival. After disputing the lead with Yomogi she gained the advantage 300 metres from the finish and kept on well to hold off a late challenge from Les Hogues and win by a neck. =2020: three-year-old season= The COVID-19 outbreak led to racing in France being suspended from 16 March. On 11 May, the day on which French racing resumed, Dream And Do contested the Group 3 Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and went off the 6.1/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Tropbeau (winner of the Prix du Calvados and third in the Cheveley Park Stakes). After racing in mid division she took the lead 400 metres from the finish but was overstken by Tropbeau and beaten half a length into second place. The 2020 edition of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches was run over the straight 1600 metres course at Deauville Racecourse on 1 June after Longchamp was deemed to be in a \\"red zone\\" with high infection rates. Dream And Do was made the 7.8/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Tropbeau, Simeen (undefeated in three races) and Tickle Me Green. After being settled just behind the leaders and overcoming some interference as she attempted to obtain a clear run, Dream And Do overtook the front-running Marieta 100 metres from the finish and held off a strong late challenge from Speak of the Devil to win by a nose. After the race Frederic Rossi, who was recording the biggest win in a 30-year training career, commented \\"I knew that 1600 metres is really the end of her rope and in my opinion she is a real champion over 1400 metres. She has that ability to accelerate very quickly and it is a delicate balancing act with her over 1600 metres\\" before going on to state that the filly would probably skip the Prix de Diane in favour of the Prix Jean Prat.

He is also sometimes referred to as \\"Pandit Basdeo Bissoondoyal\\" or \\"Professor Basdeo Bissoondoyal\\". Early life Basdeo Bissoondoyal was born in Tyack, Rivi√®re des Anguilles in 1906. He had two brothers Sookdeo and Soogrim. He relocated to Rue Valonville, Tranquebar, Port Louis with his family. Education In 1933 he travelled to Lahore and Calcutta in India where he studied philosophy, history, Sanskrit literature, Bhagavad Gita and the Vedas. Six years later Basdeo returned to Mauritius by 1939 after graduating with a Master of Arts degree from Calcutta University in the same year that his elder brother Soogrim had died at the age of 35. Social work Basdeo and his two brothers had been actively involved in the Arya Kumar Sabha branch since 1925, and by 1929 were in charge of the Arya Paropkarani Sabha branch of the Arya Samaj. From 1939 onwards Basdeo drew inspiration from Mahatma Gandhi's struggle for the Independence of India that he witnessed first hand during the six years that he had spent in the subcontinent. Thus he founded the Jan Andolan movement in Mauritius at a time when universal suffrage did not exist. His goal was to build upon the work of other movements such as the Arya Samaj which had been active since 1897 in the promotion of Hindi and progressive Hinduism. Basdeo toured the island to promote the need for education, self- expression and liberation of the mass. Basdeo trained several volunteers and encouraged young people to voice their concern against growing corruption. He spent a significant amount of time in the villages of Lallmatie, Bon Acceuil, Laventure and Briss√©eVerdiere to spread his message. Following the September 1943 Belle Vue Harel Massacre Basdeo organised the funeral ceremonies of the 4 labourers who had been shot dead by the police following a strike in protest against low wages and poor working conditions. The mass gathering of Jan Andolan at \\"Marie Reine de la Paix\\" in Port Louis on 12 December 1943, four years prior to the proclamation of the new 1947 Constitution was an indication of the mass support that he had gathered. Political impact Colonial rulers jailed Basdeo Bissoondoyal on four occasions due to the impact of his movement's educational campaign on the working poor. Following Mahatma Gandhi's example he opted to spend time in jail rather than paying the fines. However Basdeo remained an influential character on the political scene and its only after consultation with Basdeo that Guy Rozemont put forward a motion in Legislative Council to make the First of May a Public Holiday. In 1943 Basdeo Bissoondoyal and his Jan Andolan volunteers successfully organised a Maha Yaj festival in Port-Louis despite colonial rulers' cancellation of all public transport. That event was attended by about 60,000 people in the capital city. Aided by the local press whom they financed the Franco-Mauritian owners of sugar plantations and sugar mills canvassed the Governor (Sir Donald Mackenzie-Kennedy) to reduce the growing influence of Basdeo's movement as they feared social upheaval and a loss of their power and influence. Thus the British colonial government started to plan the deportation of Basdeo Bissoondoyal to Diego Garcia in a similar fashion to the 1938 deportation of trade unionist Emmanuel Anquetil to Rodrigues by Sir Bede Clifford. However after consulting Secretary of State (Arthur Creech Jones) and Emmanuel Anquetil the Governor was convinced that Basdeo had no evil intentions. Thus all plans to deport Basdeo Bissoondoyal to Diego Garcia were aborted. The British also revised the Constitution in 1947 to allow for fairer participation by poorer non-whites in electing representatives in the Legislative Council. By 1947 Basdeo had also masterminded the boycott of \\"Les Courses Malbars\\" which used to be held at Champ de Mars in Port Louis. At the annual festival degrading acts used to be performed by Indo-Mauritians for the amusement of those of other ethnic groups. One of Jan Andolan's initiatives in the 1940s was to teach villagers how to sign their names in Hindi. In those days only adults who could write their names in English, French or an Oriental language were allowed to vote. At the same time his associates Abdool Wahab Foondun, Permal Soobrayen and Mootoocoomaren Sangeelee promoted the study of Urdu and Tamil. By 1947 Basdeo Bissoondoyal and around 800 Jan Andolan volunteers had engaged in a campaign of mass education. As a result, the number of eligible voters increased from 11,445 to 72,000 in preparation for the 1948 General Elections. This eventually had a massive impact on the results of the 1948 General Elections which was the first ever practice of universal suffrage. A record number of coloured Creoles and Indo-Mauritians were elected to the Council of Government, the equivalent of the modern day Legislative Assembly. His younger brother Sookdeo, who had become fully involved in politics by 1946 after quitting his 22-year career as a school teacher, was elected to the Legislative Council in the Grand Port-Savanne constituency in the August 1948 elections.Results of the General Election for the Mauritius Legislative Council held on 10 August 1948 Electoral Commission He was re-elected in 1953.Results of the General Election for the Mauritius Legislative Council held on 27 August 1953 Electoral Commission By April 1958 the Jan Andolan movement was transformed into the Independent Forward Bloc (IFB), led by Basdeo's younger brother Sookdeo. IFB was an important partner in the coalition of parties that formed part of the Independence Party (Mauritius) which won the 1967 General Elections. Publications By 1932 Basdeo published an article in the journal L'Id√©e Libre in France. He eventually wrote in excess of 275 articles in addition to 20 books in Hindi, 14 in English, 5 in French, and also in Sanskrit over 6 decades. His works have been published in Mauritius, India, Great Britain, France, and the United States. The subject matter of his articles and books were literature, Mauritian, Indian and world history, philosophy, religion, and comparative civilizations. Notable books written by Basdeo Bissoondoyal were \\"Life in Greater India: An Autobiography\\" (1984), \\"The Truth about Mauritius\\", \\"The Essence of the Vedas and Allied Scriptures\\" (1966), \\"They Loved Mother India\\" (1967), and \\"France Looks at Modern India\\" (1966). Another initiative of his movement was the fortnightly newspaper Zamana which was published in Standard Hindi, English and French. Occasionally Zamana also contained articles in Marathi, Tamil and Urdu. Legacy In the capital city of Port Louis a statue of Basdeo Bisssondoyal was erected by the municipal council and the Basdeo Bissondoyal Esplanande is also named after him. Following the 1982 general elections and when Mauritius was not yet a republic Basdeo Bissoondoyal refused Harish Boodhoo's offer to become the first President of a contemplated Republic of Mauritius. On 8 February 2005 the Basdeo Bissoondoyal Trust Fund Act was passed by the Parliament of Mauritius to help preserve the legacy of Basdeo Bissoondoyal. One of the objectives if to create a Basdeo Bissoondoyal Memorial Library and Documentation Centre at Vallonville Street in Port-Louis where Basdeo lived and planned the activities of his Jan Andolan movement in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. It is also expected that the new Act will provide for talks, seminars, conferences, exhibitions, and other activities on the life, work, and writings of Professor Bissoondoyal.

He belonged to the Suryavansh dynasty that was installed in the region by his grandfather Vinayak Dev who was a prince of the ancient branch of the dynasty, he migrated from Kashmir to Nandapur - a kingdom in Southern Odisha. Early life Vishwanath Dev was the son of Rajah Bhairav Dev of Nandapur who were a vassal state of the Gajapatis. The Suryavansh dynasty arrived in the region in mid-15th century from Kashmir with the arrival of Vinayak Dev who married Princess Lilavati the daughter of last Silavamsi ruler and ascended the small kingdom of Nandapur. Later, Vinayak conquered the southern territories up to Rajahmundry and Srikakulam in the east. This kingdom however remained loyal and was annexed to the Gajapati empire. Evidently, Vishwanath is the fourth king in Vinayak's line and ascended the throne in 1527 during the reign of Prataprudra Deva. In 1509, his father Bhairav Dev along with other vassal kingdoms accompanied Prataprudra Deva in the battle of Kondapalli fort against Krishnadeva Raya of Vijayanagar Empire. Therefore, Vishwanath remained an ally of the Gajapati emperor. Reign After the death of Prataprudra Deva in 1540 his sons Kalua Deva and Khakura Deva were made kings and later assassinated by their minister Govinda Vidyadhar. This usurpation led to the fall of the Gajapati empire and all vassal kingdoms claimed independence. Bhoi dynasty remained the ruler of Puri and the region adjoining the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal typically North Eastern Odisha. Vishwanath Dev led an expedition against the Bhoi kings by sending his army with Mukunda Harichandran of Cossimkota. He was sent to annex the northern region and impel Govinda Vidyadhar into accepting the suzerainty of Vishwanath whose southern territory touched the Krishna-Godavari region of Telangana. The fifth report on the affairs of the company describe him as : He built the city of Rayagada and Majhighariani Temple on the banks of Nagavali. During his era, the kingdom flourished in the field of commerce, art and literature. A very learned brahmin named Simha Vajapeya attended the court of Vishwanath and wrote treatises on Law and Philosophy. With the help of this brahmin the king was able to perform the famous Vajapeya Yagna at the newly formed town named Vishwanathpur. The record of this yagna is still present in the genealogy of the Vajapeya family of Biranarasingh Pur near Puri.He adopted the title of 'Gajapati' which meant 'owner of elephants' and in Odisha a symbolic term for an emperor. This title was made popular by the Gajapati dynasty of Cuttack who ruled over an empire. Aftermath and death Everything went well until Mukunda Dev rebelled and killed the last two successors of the Bhoi dynasty and also crushed the rebellion of Raghubhanj Chottaray. He declared himself as an independent ruler in 1559 but soon Sulaiman Khan Karrani formed a kingdom in the region of Bengal which proved a potential threat to Mukund Dev. Therefore, after building an empire Vishwanath lost the northern territories to Mukund and was later challenged by Ibrahim Qutb Shah in the banks of Godavari in southern territory. He stopped the advance of the Qutb Shahi army and later signed a peace treaty with the Sultan of Golconda in which both parties agreed to mark Godavari as the border between the two kingdoms. However, this treaty was squashed after the death of Vishwanath Gajapati in 1571 as the Qutb Shahis militarily encroached the eastern parts of the kingdom lying adjacent to Bay of Bengal which made Balaram Dev accept the suzerainty of Golconda.

Arthur Savage was a well educated man, fluent in Latin and Hebrew, who had once been a Methodist minister but had changed his denominational affiliation to become a Unitarian in the late 1870s. Shortly after Clara was born, he moved the family to Medfield, Massachusetts where he became a Unitarian minister. Clara attended school in Medfield, Massachusetts, but graduated from high school in Plainfield, New Jersey, where the Savage family moved upon Arthur Savage‚Äôs retirement. Her brother in-law and editor for the New York Post, Charles Selden, inspired Clara's interest in journalism, and she wrote for her high school's magazine. Career Clara Littledale attended Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, where her interest in journalism continued. While a Smith student, she was a member of the college's Press Board, and wrote articles for major newspapers, including the New York Times, before graduating in 1913. Shortly after graduating, Clara tried her hand at a career in teaching, but was encouraged by a school principal who insisted that she wanted to be a writer and facilitated her career change. She was shortly hired by the New York Evening Post as their first ever woman reporter, and worked to report on suffrage conventions and parades.Mrs. Littledale, Magazine Editor, Head of Parents‚Äô Since 1926 Dies at 64 ‚Äî Sought to Improve Family Life. 10 January, 1956. New York Times. Not long after being hired, she was promoted to the position of editor of the woman's page. She stayed at the New York Evening Post for only one year. In 1914, Littledale accepted the position of press chairman for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). While in that position, Littledale frequently attended and observed suffrage meetings and marched in parades; later in life she would express regret for carrying a banner that read: \\"If Idiots and Morons Can Vote, Why Can't I?\\" By 1915, Littledale's time as press chairman for NAWSA had proved her distaste for publicity work and she left the position to accept a new job as associate editor for Good Housekeeping, where she reported on politics in Washington D.C from a woman's perspective. When World War I began, Littledale was posted to France as a reporter for Good Housekeeping, where she reported on the war from a woman's perspective. After six months, her superiors at Good Housekeeping ordered her to return home, to which she famously responded with a telegram that read \\"Resigning and Remaining.\\"Clara Littledale Savage. 7 September, 1937. Lewiston Daily Sun. Clara Littledale returned to the United States in 1920, at which time she married her former coworker at the Evening Post Harold Aylmer Littledale, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who would eventually go on to become the editor of the New York Times. Rosemary Littledale, their daughter, was born in 1922. Clara Littledale continued to write free-lance stories centered themes of marriage and family life, and they were published in journals such as Good Housekeeping, The New Republic, and McCall's. George J. Hecht, founder of Children, the Magazine for Parents watched Clara Littledale's career with interest, and approached her multiple times about becoming the managing editor of his magazine. She initially refused him to raise her daughter, Rosemary, but eventually agreed to the work if she could work in the office four days a week and spend three days at home with her children. In 1929, the magazine changed its name to Parents Magazine, and Clara Littledale went on to hold the position of editor for thirty years until her death.\\"Parents Magazine\\". Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society. In her capacity as editor, Clara Littledale wrote often about topics such as discipline, sex education, and character building, and wanted what she wrote to be accessible to the average person. Her parenting philosophy was for parents and children to get along, and as such she advised parents not to be too serious and disciplinarian. She supported parents using their own common sense, and encouraged them not to rely too heavily on the advice of experts, but she often included scientific research on childhood development in her writing. Both Littledale and Hecht were progressives, and as such used their platform to advocate against child labor, as well as for better vocational guidance and training, school lunch programs, nursery and play schools, as well as Federal aid for education. Parents Magazine was incredibly successful under her leadership, reaching one million subscribers by 1946, distributing two million study outlines to mothers' clubs, Parent Teacher Associations, and child study groups, and publishing book-length advice manuals. In her position as editor of Parents Magazine, Littledale also spoke often on the radio and became a familiar voice there, and as such broadened her audience significantly. During World War II, Littledale raised funds for refugee children from Europe, and held memberships in the Child Study Association of America, the American Association for Adult Education, the National Commission for Mental Hygiene and the National Council of Parent Education. Plane crash In February 1941, Clara and Harold Littledale boarded an Eastern Airlines plane in order to take a holiday to Mexico.Hecht, G. J., & Clara, S. L. (1941, 05). Mrs. Littledale is doing nicely, thanks! Parents' Magazine, 16, 40. The plane crashed near Atlanta, Georgia shortly after midnight on February 27th. In the days after the crash, Clara Littledale dictated a report of the crash for Parents Magazine, in which she recounted her realization that the plane was crashing, being pinned under three pine trees, and the several uninjured passengers who left to form a rescue party, which returned at 6 A.M. the following morning. Clara Littledale was relatively unscathed, but her husband Harold was permanently paralyzed. Their already strained marriage became untenable as a result, and they divorced in 1945. Death and legacy In 1947, Clara Littledale was diagnosed with cancer, but she continued to work for Parents Magazine through a series of operations and chronic pain. She participated in many events and engagements despite her diagnosis, including attending the White House Conference on Family Life in 1948, speaking at the Mental Hygiene Society Child Welfare Conference in 1949, taking a transcontinental tour in 1950, and traveling to Hawaii as a guest of the United States Navy in 1953. Clara Littledale died in 1956 in New York City having never retired. Her papers are held by Schlesinger Library in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1983, a revised version appeared in the Big Rubble: The Deadly City boxed set., this set the adventure in the Griffin Gate area of the Big Rubble, along with other related scenarios. It was republished in 1999 by Moon Design Publications in Gloranthan Classics Volume I ‚Äì Pavis & Big Rubble .

Likewise, a Classic Edition of Big Rubble including Balastor's Barracks was republished in 2019, with a POD edition in 2020. Contents Originally published as a 24-page booklet with a cardstock cover. The booklet is divided into an introductory section, two maps, and a description of 35 rooms containing over 60 monsters who seem to have no relationship with each other or the environment. The revised version in Big Rubble shrank it to 14 pages, mainly cleaning up the layout, and reducing the number of monsters to around 45. Reception In the August- September 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #14), Jim Donohoe thought the adventure was \\"too much of a killer dungeon to be satisfactory as a campaign.\\" However, he believed Balastor's Barracks might be usable as a single introductory adventure, since \\"If used as a solitaire dungeon, Balastor's Barracks will give a feel as to what a party of Runequest characters can handle. The layout of the Barracks ‚Äî three tough complexes and a few odd rooms ‚Äî‚Äî means that only a party of very tough characters can expect to survive.\\" Given its lack of general usability, he gave the adventure a poor rating of only 5 out of 10. Writing a retrospective review for Guide de R√¥liste Galactique in 2009, J√©r√¥me Bianquis thought that even though this was a very early publication by Chaosium, it was a poor effort that did not fulfill the potential of RuneQuest. Bianquis especially noted the numerous monsters shoehorned into a succession of rooms that \\"have no particular reason to be there, and one wonders how they manage to live together, and to feed themselves.\\" He concluded that it was an adventure \\"without imagination, and without any interest.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Classic Edition Kickstarter Category:RuneQuest adventures ","title":"Balastor's Barracks"},{"id":"64163985","text":"Tanner Robert Krebs (born 4 January 1996) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Brisbane Bullets of the National Basketball League (NBL).

Created between 1815 and 1816, it is the 13th of the 22 aquatints making up the series Los disparates. Along with the rest of the series it was first published in 1864 by the Real Academia de Nobles Artes de San Fernando. This work is one of Goya's most cryptic and mysterious, and is open to a number of interpretation. Some have seen Goya's use of flight as a metaphor for instability, human irrationality and the inconstancy of fortune. Other commentators have seen it as a metaphor for political and philosophical innovation. Preparatory drawings As with all of his prints, Goya produced a preparatoty drawing for A way of flying. There is also an artist's proof that was made with just the etched image before the aquatint was added.

The remains of the hall today are mostly just foundation walls. The site is a protected Scheduled Monument. Not to be confused with 17th-century Padley Hall near Ripley. Padley Hall was a large double courtyard house dating back to the 14th century, although it was built on the site of an earlier Norman manor house. William the Conqueror gave the Padley estate to his supporter the head of the De Bernac family. The Bernac family changed their name to Padley after the estate. The hall was built for the Padley family and subsequently passed onto the local aristocratic Eyre family, when Joan Padley married Robert Eyre (Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests in 1481). It became the residence of Sir Thomas Fitzherbert through his marriage to Anne Eyre in 1534. The Fitzherbert family were devout Roman Catholics, illegally renouncing the Church of England. Sir Thomas had given the hall to his younger brother John by 1588. In July 1588, the hall was raided and two Catholic priests (Nicholas Garlick and Robert Ludlum) were discovered hiding within the walls. Two weeks later they were found guilty of high treason (being ordained priests in England) and they were hanged, drawn and quartered in Derby. Their corpses were displayed on poles on St. Mary‚Äôs Bridge. They became known as the 'Padley Martyrs'. John Fitzherbert was imprisoned and died in 1590. Sir Thomas Fitzherbert had spent 32 years in prison for his beliefs and died in the Tower of London in 1591. Padley Manor was confiscated by the Crown before being returned later to the Fitzherbert family. William Fitzherbert inherited the estate in 1649 but hefty recusancy fines and family debts forced him to sell the hall, which gradually fell into disrepair. Stones were taken from the hall ruins to construct two barns. Padley Chapel was the former gatehouse to the hall and was used as a farm building following the closure of the hall. The building is still intact and in 1933 it was converted into a Roman Catholic chapel in honour of the martyrs. A pilgrimage to Padley Chapel began in 1892 in honour of the executed martyrs and it still takes place in July each year from nearby Grindleford railway station. The chapel is a Grade I listed building. The National Trust's Longshaw Estate and Padley Gorge would have been part of the original Padley estate.

The book is a compilation of various annals recording the acts of the kings of Israel and Judah by a Deuteronomic compiler in the seventh century BCE, with a supplement added in the sixth century BCE. This chapter records the events during the reigns of Azariah (Uzziah) and his son, Jotham, the kings of Judah, as well as of Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah and Pekah, the kings of Israel. Twelve first verses of the narrative belong to a major section 2 Kings 9:1‚Äì15:12 covering the period of Jehu's dynasty. Text This chapter was originally written in the Hebrew language. It is divided into 38 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\\\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\\\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\\\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). Structure This chapter can be divided into the following sections: * : Regnal account of Azariah (Uzziah) ben Amaziah of Judah * : Regnal account of Zechariah ben Jeroboam of Israel * : Regnal account of Shallum ben Jabesh of Israel * : Regnal account of Menahem ben Gadi of Israel * : Regnal account of Pekahiah ben Menahem of Israel * : Regnal account of Pekah ben Remaliah of Israel * : Regnal account of Jotham ben Uzziah of Judah Analysis This chapter displays a contrast between the stability of the southern kingdom and the downward sliding of the northern kingdom, with two royal records of Judah bracketing the narrative of five Israel kings in quick succession. Each reign is judged using a standard formula, one for the kings of Judah (verses , ) and another for the kings of Israel (verses , , , ). Azariah (Uzziah), king of Judah (15:1‚Äì7) The regnal records of Azariah the son of Amaziah, the king of Judah, can be demarcated by the introductory form (verses 1‚Äì4) and the concluding form (verses (5‚Äì7). The main account is in verse 5 regarding the king's leprosy and the active role of his son, Jotham, in ruling the kingdom on his behalf, but the length of the co-regency is not explicitly recorded. The period of his reign coincides largely with the reign of Jeroboam, who ruled over a kingdom territory comparable to that of Solomon, so Azariah's kingdom was a vassal to the kingdom of Israel. provides a more detailed account of Azariah's reign, especially the reason God striking him with leprosy, his 'military actions against Philistia, the Arabs of Geur-Baal, and the Meunites', as well as 'his efforts to fortify Jerusalem and to secure the hold on the Shephelah.' =Verse 1= :In the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Azariah the son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began to reign. ESV *\\"In the 27th year of Jeroboam\\": According to Thiele's chronology,Thiele, Edwin R., The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings, (1st ed.; New York: Macmillan, 1951; 2d ed.; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1965; 3rd ed.; Grand Rapids: Zondervan/Kregel, 1983). , 9780825438257 following \\"accession year method\\", Azariah the son of Amaziah of Judah started to reign alone as the 10th king of Judah between April and September 767 BCE, following a period of co-regency (since the capture of Amaziah by Joash of Israel). =Verse 2= :He was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother‚Äôs name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem. NKJV *Cross reference: *\\"He reigned 52 years\\": according to Thiele's chronology, following the \\"accession year method\\", Azariah became king at the age of 16 when his father, Amaziah, was taken as hostage to the kingdom of Israel in 791 BCE, as a co-regent until his father's death between April and September 767 BCE, when he ruled alone at the age of 39, until his death between September 740 BCE and September 739 BCE at the age of 68. *\\"Jecholiah of Jerusalem\\" (also written as \\"Jecoliah\\" (ESV) or \\"Jekoliah\\" (MEV)) could be arranged as a wife for Amaziah to 'consolidate Amaziah's hold on Jerusalem following a failed attempt at revolt'. =Verse 5= :And the Lord touched the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and he lived in a separate house. And Jotham the king's son was over the household, governing the people of the land. MEV *\\"A leper\\": suffered from \\"leprosy\\", which was a 'term for several skin diseases' (cf. ).Note [a] on 2 Kings 15:5 in MEV As a leper, Azariah was deemed impure (), and unfit to carry out the state functions or to appear at the temple. *\\"A separate house\\": from , bet hakhofshit; the meaning is uncertain.Note [a] on 2 Kings 15:5 in NET Bible The Torah commands lepers to live apart from the population (). =Verse 7= :And Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Jotham his son reigned in his place. ESV The time of Azariah's death coincides with the time Isaiah received his call to be a prophet (\\"in the year that King Uzziah died\\"; Isaiah 6:1). E.L. Sukenik found an Aramaic inscription that reads, \\"Here were brought the bones of Uzziah, king of Judah. Do not open!\\" and once marked the tomb of Uzziah outside Jerusalem.Albright, W. F. (1931) \\"The Discovery of an Aramaic Inscription Relating to King Uzziah\\". BASOR 44:8‚Äì10. Zechariah, king of Israel (15:8‚Äì12) Zechariah, the last ruler of the Jehu dynasty, only reigned for six months and his assassination ends a long period of stability in the kingdom of Israel. It is set in the frame of the divine guidance that God himself announced to the founder of the dynasty (2 Kings 10:30) and confirms the fulfillment of it in verse 12. =Verse 8= :In the thirty-eighth year of Azariah king of Judah, Zechariah the son of Jeroboam reigned over Israel in Samaria six months. NKJV *\\"In th 38th year of Azariah\\": based onThiele's chronology, McFall determines that Jeroboam should have died between the month Elul (6th month; August/September) and Tishrei (7th month; September/October) 753 BCE, and immediately was succeeded by Zechariah, his son, while still counted as the 38th year of Azariah (which was calculated from Tishrei to Tishrei or September to September). *\\"Six months\\": Zechariah's assassination happened probably in the early months of 752 BCE (before 1 Nisan 752 BCE), which is counted as the 39th year of Azariah. =Verse 10= :And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead KJV *\\"Before the people\\" (KJV, ASV, NASB, NIV, NRSV, NLT): from the Masoretic Hebrew text , qaval  øam. Lucian's Greek version reads ‚Äúin Ibleam‚Äù ( beyivle øam (cf. NAB, TEV),Note on 2 Kings 15:10 in NET Bible the location where Ahaziah of Judah is slain by Jehu (2 Kings 9:27), which provides a certain irony when Zechariah, the last of Jehu's dynasty, was also slain in the same place. The Greek Septuagint text in Codex Vaticanus and some Hebrew text reads Kebla øam. Shallum, king of Israel (15:13‚Äì16) After bringing an end to the Jehu dynasty (verse 10), Shallum could only reign for a month before he was slain by Menahem. The literary structure consists of an 'introductory regnal form' (verse ), the body of the account (verse 14) and the 'concluding regnal form' (verse ). Menahem's submission to Assyria (verses ) suggests that his action was to stop an attempt to revolt against the Assyrian by Shallum. Menahem, king of Israel (15:17‚Äì22) The 10-year reign of Menahem provides a 'rare period of stability' in the final years of the northern kingdom, which was the result of Menahem's tributary payment to the Assyrian king, Tiglath-Pileser III (also known as Pul, cf. ANET 272). The tribute, along with those from other monarch, is listed with Menahem's name explicitly in the annals of the Assyria (ANET 283‚Äì284). To pay that tribute, Menahem instituted an oppressive tax, fifty shekels (about 1¬º pounds, or 575 gramsNote on 2 Kings 15:20 in MEV) of silver per person from all the wealthy men in Israel (verse 20), which may contribute to the coup against his son after he died. =Verse 17= :In the thirty-ninth year of Azariah king of Judah, Menahem the son of Gadi began to reign over Israel, and he reigned ten years in Samaria. ESV *\\"In the 39th year of Azariah\\": based onThiele's chronology, Menahem would start to reign by the end of April 752 BCE and died between September 742 BCE and April 741 BCE after sitting on the throne for 10 years. =Verse 19= \\"Pul\\" or \\"Tiglath-Pileser III\\", king of Assyria. Stone panel, Assyrian artwork, ca. 728 BC. From the Central Palace in Nimrud. :And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. KJV *\\"Assyria\\": from this verse to the end of the book, Assyria is mentioned 48 times (12 times 4), replacing Aram as the principal threat to the northern kingdom (Aram essentially disappears after 2 Kings 16, except one brief mention in ). *\\"1000 talents\\" of metal: is about 38 tons, or 34 metric tons.Note on 2 Kings 15:19 in MEV One talent was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms.Note on 2 Kings 15:19 in ESV Tiglath-Pileser records the tribute from Menahem in one of his inscriptions (ANET 283).The Annals of Tiglath- pileser. Livius.org. Translation into English by Leo Oppenheim. Quote: \\"I [Tiglath Pileser III] received tribute from... Menahem of Samaria...gold, silver, ...\\". Pekahiah, king of Israel (15:23‚Äì26) The main regnal account of Pekahiah, the 17th king of Israel, only mentions his assassination by a group of 50 men from Gilead led by Pekah ben Remaliah, his own captain (verse 25). =Verse 23= :In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two years. KJV *\\"In the 50th year of Azariah\\": based onThiele's chronology, Pekahiah would start to reign between September 742 BCE and April 741 BCE after the death of his father, Menahem. *\\"Two years\\": Pekahiah would have died between September 740 BCE and April 739 BCE based on the accession year method in Thiele's chronology.  Pekah, king of Israel (15:27‚Äì31) The main record of Pekah's reign in this section focuses on the invasion of Tiglath-Pileser III into Israel in 734‚Äì732 BCE and his murder in a coup led by Hosea ben Elah, backed by the Assyrians, as noted in the annals of Assyria (ANET 284. Quote: \\"They overthrew their king Pekah (Pa-qa-·∏•a) and I placed Hoshea (A-√∫-si- º) as king over them. I [Tiglath-Pileser III] received from them 10 talents of gold, 1,000 (?) talents of silver as their [tri]bute, and brought them to Assyria\\"). Pekah's alliance with Rezin of Damascus in the Syro-Ephraimite War to resist the Assyrians and attack Judah, a vassal to the Assyrians, is recorded in multiple passages (verse 37, 2 Kings 16:5, 7‚Äì9; Isaiah 7:1‚Äì17; Isaiah 9:1) and also in the annals of the Assyrians (ANET 283‚Äì284). =Verse 27= :In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah, Pekah the son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and reigned twenty years. NKJV * \\"In the 52nd year of Azariah\\": based on Thiele's chronology, Pekah reign as a sole king in Samaria between September 740 BCE and April 739 BCE after the death of Pekahiah, but he may have been considered to reign together with Menahem 12 years earlier. * \\"Reigned 20 years\\": Thiele-McFall chronology maintains that Pekah started to reign together with Menahem since the 29th year of Azariah at the end of Nisan (April) 752 BCE, and was a sole king starting between September 740 BCE and April 739 BCE for 8 years until his death between September 732 BCE and April 731 BCE, so the total years of his reign is 20 years. Jotham, king of Judah (15:32‚Äì38) Like his father (Azariah or Uzziah), Jotham was given a good assessment 'in the sight of the ' (verse 34; cf. verse 3), although both kings did not remove the 'high places', which was later done by Hezekiah () and Josiah (), nor perform notable political actions. Jotham's memorable achievement was the building of 'the upper gate of the house of the LORD' (verse ). =Verse 32= :In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign. ESV *Cross reference: *\\"'In the 2nd year of Pekah\\": According to Thiele-McFall chronology, Jotham started co-regency with his father, Uzziah, around April 750 BCE, when Uzziah became a leper, and only reign as sole king after Uzziah's death between September 740 BCE and September 739 BCE, until he stepped down around September 735 BCE (16th year of his reign), but still held some state functions until his death around April 731 BCE (20th year of \\"his reign\\"). The synchronization with Hosea's reign indicates that Jotham died between September 732 BCE and September 731 BCE. Thiele notes that the year of Jotham's ascension on the throne is counted as the \\"first regnal year\\" (not the \\"ascension year\\") as usually used for co-regency. However, the information that it starts on the 2nd year of Pekah indicates that the ascension occurred between Nisan (April) and Tishrei (September) 750 BCE, not as usual in the month of Tishrei for the kings of Judah. =Verse 33= :He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. ESV *Cross references: , * \\"16 years\\": according to Thiele's chronology, Jotham started to reign at the age of 25 in co-regency with his father, Uzziah (57 years old), around April 750 BCE, and became a sole king between September 740 BCE and September 739 BCE, after Uzziah's death (68 years old). Jotham transferred the throne to his son, Ahaz, around September 735 BCE to conclude his reign for a total of 16 years. However, Jotham seems to hold some state functions until April 731 BCE, while Ahaz officially was on the throne, resulting a phrase \\"in the 20th year of Jothan\\") in the synchronization with the reign of Hosea in the kingdom of Israel (verse ), despite the official count of 16 years of Jotham's reign. Jotham died between September 732 BCE and September 732 BCE.

Rizzo Monument, was installed in Philadelphia, in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Erected in 1998, the bronze sculpture was removed in June 2020. Black Lives Matter activists and others protested the statue's presence, and the statue was taken down during the George Floyd protests. Background As mayor, Rizzo was a strong opponent of desegregation of Philadelphia's schools, and prevented the construction of public housing in majority-white neighborhoods. While running for a third term, Rizzo urged supporters to \\"Vote White\\". During his tenure as police commissioner and mayor, the Philadelphia police department engaged in patterns of police brutality, intimidation, coercion, and disregard for constitutional rights. The patterns of police brutality were documented in a Pulitzer-Prize winning Philadelphia Inquirer series by William K. Marimow and Jon Neuman. History Artist Zenos Frudakis with the statue, 2009 The statue was placed on its pedestal on December 30, 1998 and unveiled on January 1, 1999. A crowd of 150 listened to speeches by Mayor Ed Rendell.

In August 2017, following the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the statue was vandalized, kicking off further calls for its removal. The artist behind the statue, Zenos Frudakis, told the Tribune that he \\"hesitated to do the work at first\\" due to Rizzo's past and would accept the statue's removal if the city decided on it. In November 2017, the city voted to remove the statue. However, the mayor refused to remove the statue, due to the $200,000 expense involved. Following unsuccessful attempts to pull down the statue by protesters in June 2020, the mayor's office finally ordered the removal.

The group is defined as all taxa derived from the ancestor of the type genus Angolachelys and Solnhofia, a definition that could potentially encompass a clade of entirely marine turtles. Angolachelonia was originally inclusive of only Solnhofia, Angolachelys and Sandownia when originally concevied by Octavio Mateus and colleagues in 2009, but later phylogenetic analyses by Serjocha Evers and Roger Benson in 2018 unites the family Sandownidae, including Angolachelys and Sandownia among other taxa, with the entirely Late Jurassic clade Thalassochelydia, where Solnhofia may be a basal member. While the placement of Solnhofia is weak and the clade that Angolachelonia represents may change with further analysis, the clade of Sandownidae and Thalassochelydia is well-supported, and does not collapse despite the uncertain evolutionary history of the group.

Life In 1953, De Bruyne graduated as an interior architect at the Sint-Lucas School in Brussels. In 1955‚Äì56 and 1957, he participated in the salons of modern social furniture in Ghent, and in 1958, he received the ‚ÄúGolden Mark‚Äù. At this time, De Bruyne also did an internship at Studio Gi√≤ Ponti in Milan. In 1959, he received an honourable mention in the international furniture competition of Cant√π. In 1960, De Bruyne won a prize with chair designs in the European Arflex - Domus_(magazine) competition in Milan. In 1961, he won another prize at Cant√π with a dining room design. He held exhibitions in Belgium and abroad and took on the most diverse assignments. De Bruyne taught at the St.-Lukas Institute in Schaarbeek, and received a state prize in 1984 for his artistic career. The entire archive of his work is owned by the Design Museum Gent. Work On the occasion of an exhibit in the Saint Peter‚Äôs Abbey in Ghent in 1976, Jan Pieter Ballegeer writes: ‚ÄúBut what is the message of De Bruyne‚Äôs furniture? There is, first and foremost, an attack of sorts on the familiar itself, an annihilation, if you will, of the common. There is a distortion of objects as one sees in dadaism, surrealism and pop-art. However, De Bruyne‚Äôs deformation is not characteristically expressionistic, not mainly meant to be understood immediately, but rather delicately mysterious and complexly aesthetic, ingeniously manneristic. The designer‚Äôs artistic self-awareness lends to his furniture a remarkable monumentality? Their nature almost demands that they not be placed against walls or in corners, but that they stand free in space, like sculptures. =Pioneer of the postmodern= De Bruyne‚Äôs projects from the period 1970‚Äì1987 should definitely be linked to the postmodern school in architecture and design. The best-known designers in this respect are Studio Alchimia and the Memphis Group (Alessandro Mendini, A. Branzi, Ettore Sottsass). The many traits in common with the postmodern Italians should not obscure the fact that De Bruyne had already started this type of work in 1970, whereas Studio Alchimia and the Memphis Group only developed their activities a decade later. This is exactly why some call De Bruyne a precursor of postmodern furniture. =Chantilly cabinet= De Bruyne was paid hommage in the exhibition ‚ÄúPostmodernism, style and subversion 1970‚Äì1990‚Äù in the London Victoria and Albert Museum (2011‚Äì2012), where his Chantilly cabinet (1975) took up a prominent place. Chantilly cabinet 1975 =Egypt= In 1974, a special interest in Egypt takes hold. De Bruyne looks into the meaning of Egyptian contributions to furniture history. Like a scientist, De Bruyne collects data about the Egyptian furniture piece, analyses and compares it. A decade worth of numerous measurements results in hundreds of drawings about the structure of the Egyptian furniture. Based on these drawings, he makes mathematical and structural analyses. In 1985, De Bruyne comes up with spectacular results: he supposedly found the key to the secret canon and decyphered the underlying laws of Egyptian furniture, painting and sculpture. Moreover, his findings would serve as a basis for the understanding of Egyptian pyramids from a rational and mathematical perspective. De Bruyne plans a book with the results of his studies by the end of 1985, but finds some obstacles in his way that complicate the completion of his work. In February 1987, De Bruyne passes away. In 1982, he used the Egyptian measuring system in his own designs. By the end of his career, he would apply the entire canon to his work. =Furniture and objects= Pieter De Bruyne designed an unprecedented number of furniture pieces and objects, over 200 of which were realised. De Bruyne also designed more than 175 interiors and architectural projects. Pieter De Bruyne residence Blue room Pieter De Bruyne residence 1972 In 1972, he renovated a neoclassicistic townhouse in Aalst, turning it into a work residence. The designer named several rooms after a special colour, which then defined its decoration, like the blue room.

Description The bronze sculpture depicts Charles Linn, and rests on a granite-clad base. The statue is based on a painting displayed in the Linn-Henley Research Library (but shows Linn bearded, whereas the painting does not) and weighs approximately 800 pounds. Linn's hand rests on a pillar, representing the establishment of the National Bank of Birmingham (Regions Financial Corporation). The memorial also has plaques about Linn and identifying major donors. History The statue was commissioned from sculptor Branko Medenica by the Alabama-Mississippi Chapter of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in honor of their \\"Legacy of Leadership\\" campaign chairman, Arthur Henley, a descendant of Linn. The statue was announced in 2012, and dedicated on \\"World MS Day\\" on May 29, 2013. Medenica attended the dedication. On May 31, 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the statue was defaced and eventually toppled. Medenica, who had incorporated a tribute of his own to his sister-in-law who died of MS, said he understood why the statue was toppled but lamented the loss of his personal commemoration: \\"They didn't know. I think it was like mass hysteria gone out of control. You know so it sad. It's sad.\\" The artist has said he would be willing to restore the sculpture.

Challener, was a Canadian painter of murals as well as an easel painter of oils and watercolours and a draftsman in black-and-white and pastel. He also did illustrations for books and commercial art.  Biography  Early years = Challener was born in Whetstone, Middlesex, England. He moved with his family to Canada in 1870, returned to England in 1876 to attend school, then came back to Canada in 1883. He worked as an office boy for a business firm and drew individuals he saw from a window. Artist and photographer, John Arthur Fraser, of the Notman and Fraser firm, recognized his talent and paid for him to attend the Ontario School of Art (from 1984 to 1886) at night. Afterwards, Challener studied privately with George Agnew Reid while working for the Toronto Lithographing Company. Later, he became a newspaper artist. = Career = After travelling through Europe and the Middle East in 1898‚Äì1899, Challener began working as a muralist and participated in the decoration of the recently completed Toronto City Hall. He created murals for hotels, such as Fort Rouill√© in Toronto's King Edward Hotel (1900) and Winnipeg's Royal Alexandra Hotel (1906-1912) (the four surviving panels are in the Manitoba Archives); theatres, including the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto (1906); and office buildings, restaurants , and passenger boats. For Parkwood, the home of Colonel Robert Samuel McLaughlin, he did panels for McLaughlin's office and mural paintings (1924-6) for the residence which show members of the McLaughlin family, among them artist Isabel McLaughlin as a young woman. In painting murals, Challener was part of a chapter in Canadian Art called Decorative Painting based on William Morris\`s Arts and Crafts movement. In Canada, the Arts and Crafts Society of Canada was founded by George Agnew Reid and others in 1903. It became the Canadian Society of Applied Art in 1905, and combined with a City Beautiful movement to encourage murals in civic and commercial establishments. In Toronto, the Society of Mural Decorators was founded in 1897 by Reid, Challener, William Cruikshank and Edmund Wyly Grier. Many artists, both before and after the society was formed, executed murals, only Challener did it more than others. \\"He has produced some very clever and important decorations', wrote E.F.B. Johnston in 1912. In 1891, Challener first exhibited with the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts and he showed with the Academy almost every year thereafter until 1948. He was elected to full membership in 1899. The Montreal Gazette wrote of him on April 19 of that year that his work entitles him to a place among the foremost of Canadian artists since it is, in the main, \\"serious and sincere\\". A Singing Lesson, 1900 In 1900, the work he showed at the Royal Canadian Academy, A Singing Lesson (1900; also shown in the Art Association of Montreal and in the Rochester Art Club Annual Exhibition in 1902) was singled out for praise. In reviews published in 1900, the Ottawa Citizen wrote that the picture, \\"showing a young lady, clad in a yellow gown, standing before a piano, expressed, gracefully, an abundance of sentiment\\", while the Ottawa Evening Journal wrote that the painting was \\"fresh, daring, and finished\\" and called Challener \\"one of Canada‚Äôs most promising and original artists.\\" At the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 in Buffalo he was awarded a bronze medal and in 1904, he received an award at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, informally known as the St. Louis World's Fair, at St. Louis. He received the bronze medal at the Pan American Exhibition for his painting The Workers of the Fields which he deposited in the Royal Canadian Academy diploma collection in the National Gallery of Canada. He worked in Toronto, but moved to Conestoga near Waterloo, in 1907, to Winnipeg from 1913 to 1916, then back to Toronto. Canada's Grand Armada, 1919 During WWI, Challener worked as a painter for the Canadian War Memorials Department. His painting Canada's Grand Armada depicts the first contingent of the Canadian Expeditionary Force sailing from the Gasp√© in Quebec to Britain in 1914. The painting is held in the Canadian War Museum collection. From 1921-24, he taught at Central Technical School, Toronto, and from 1927 to 1952, he taught at the Ontario School of Art. During these years, he accumulated archival material on Canadian art which today is in the Edward P. Taylor Library & Archives of the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto. = Death = Challener died in Toronto on September 30, 1959, at the age of 90.  Collections  Challener's paintings are in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; Government of Ontario Art Collection, Toronto; the MacKenzie Art Gallery, Regina; the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa; and the Winnipeg Art Gallery.

The incident occurred during protests in St. Louis, Missouri over the killing of George Floyd. Persons involved Victim = David Dorn (November 29, 1942 ‚Äì June 2, 2020), was a retired African-American captain in the Metropolitan Police Department, City of St. Louis, working there from November 1969 to October 2007. He later served as police chief of Moline Acres since February 2008. =Accused= The accused shooter, Stephan Cannon, is a 24-year-old African-American man from St. Louis.  Incident  On June 2, 2020, Dorn was discovered on the sidewalk in front of Lee's Pawn and Jewelry around 2:30 a.m. He had reportedly been responding to the burglar alarm of his friend's pawn shop when he was fatally shot by looters. His death was streamed on Facebook live. The thirteen-minute video was briefly taken down by Facebook before being reinstated with a warning screen and has been viewed more than 94,000 times as of June 3. In the video, a young man states: \\"Oh my God, cuz....They just killed this old man at the pawn shop over some TVs....c'mon, man, thats somebody's granddaddy.\\"  Investigation  Crime Stoppers offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest; this amount has been raised to $56,700. On June 5, St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department Homicide Section released surveillance footage to the public to provide clues and evidence in their investigation of David Dorn's death. The video captured a total of seven suspects trespassing at Lee's Pawn and Jewelry at 4123 Martin Luther King Drive. The footage was taken on June 2 from 2:13 a.m. to 2:16 a.m. All suspects in the video had their faces concealed. Six wore masks, and one had a white shirt wrapped around his face and head. At least two of the men were seen armed with handguns. One person pulled his handgun to target the entrance before joining the others. Another suspect had a cut on his left palm. The reward for additional information that could capture the criminals has been raised by $6,000 since the surveillance video's release. On June 7, a 24-year-old suspect named Stephan Cannon was arrested. He faces charges of first-degree murder, robbery, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. As of June 18, a total of six persons has been charged, two for murder and four for burglary and stealing.  Aftermath  A small memorial was quickly set up outside the shop, with a handwritten sign stating; \\"Y'all killed a black man because 'they' killed a black man??? Rest in peace.\\" St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden ordered all the departments officers to wear black mourning bands on their police badges to honor Dorn. Several GoFundMe fundraisers quickly sprang up online, although none of them were endorsed by family members. A Fundly account has been endorsed by the family and they have asked for support of organizations such as CrimeStoppers or BackStoppers. Dorn's widow, Ann Dorn, spoke in favor of Donald Trump at the 2020 Republican National Convention with David's two sons Brian and Kielen Powell at her side. The officer's daughters, Debra White and Lisa Dorn, called Ann Dorn and asked her not to speak about their father at the convention and told the St. Louis American that their father was a registered Democrat and didn't support Trump. \\"She can be a Trump supporter in her own right, but she should not politicize our father's death for Trump's agenda. He thought Trump is doing many things to ruin our country,\\" Lisa Dorn told the paper. Debra White told the paper that her father opposed much of Trump's rhetoric and policies, including \\"the things he said about Colin Kaepernick, the kids locked up in cages, the racist remarks.\\" Dorn's daughters stated their father did not want to support the \\"law and order agenda\\".  Reactions  His widow, Ann Marie Dorn told reporters that her husband was a friend of the owner of the store and would routinely check on the business when the alarm would go off. She later spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention about her husband's death, over the objections of their daughters who claimed he was opposed to Donald Trump. The former St. Louis County Police Chief, Tim Finch called Dorn a \\"true public servant\\". Missouri Governor Mike Parson tweeted that Dorn and George Floyd should not have died, saying that the ensuing violence and criminal activity needed to stop. The Ethical Society of the Police, an organization which supports black police officers in the United States, tweeted \\"(Dorn) was murdered by looters at a pawnshop. He was the type of brother that would've given his life to save them if he had to. Violence is not the answer, whether it's a citizen or officer.

E. Mauger House is a historic Queen Anne style home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was built around 1896 by Maude Goodlander and Martha Talbott, but is most closely associated with William and Brittania Mauger, who owned it from 1907 to 1932. Later, it was converted into a boarding house and remained in use as rental housing until the 1980s. Starting in 1985, the building was restored to its original appearance and has operated as a bed and breakfast since 1987. It is a 2 1/2 story brick house with a hip roof, asymmetrical front elevation with a large entrance porch, and a two-level sleeping porch on the west side. The house was added to the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties and the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as \\"701 Roma NW\\". History The house was built by Maude Goodlander and her mother, Martha Talbott, who was reportedly one of Albuquerque's earliest Anglo residents, having moved there after the U.S. Civil War. Goodlander bought the lot from Franz Huning in 1895 and the house was reported to be under construction in September 1896. Goodlander and Talbott moved to Missouri in 1899, keeping the house as a rental property at first and then selling it to William E. Mauger (1867‚Äì1923) in 1907. with Mauger was a wool buyer and hardware store owner who moved to Albuquerque in 1902 for health reasons after contracting tuberculosis. He added a third lot to the property in 1912, enabling the construction of a two-story sleeping porch on the west side of the house. After Mauger died in 1923, his widow Brittania (1865‚Äì1968) lived in the house until 1932. Around 1940, the building was converted into a boarding house and the rooms were partitioned to create a total of 18 rental units. It remained in use for this purpose until the 1980s, by which time the building was in poor condition. In 1984, the house was purchased by Richard Carleno, a local geologist, who spent two years and $200,000 carefully restoring it to its original appearance. The renovation included restoring the rooms to their original size, reopening the porches, which had been stuccoed over at some point, and replacing all of the plumbing. Once the project was complete, Carleno opened the house as a bed and breakfast in 1987. As of 2020, it remains in operation as the Mauger Estate Bed & Breakfast. Architecture The Mauger House is a 2 1/2 story Queen Anne style building, constructed from brick laid in the common bond. It has a truncated hip roof with shingled gables on the front and rear elevations and small shed-roofed dormers on the side elevations. The asymmetrical south (front) elevation has a large open porch on the ground floor and another small porch on the second floor centered under the front gable. The west side of the house has a two-level sleeping porch which was added after 1912. A notable feature on the east side is a pair of oval windows which flank an interior fireplace. The interior of the house was restored maintaining much of the original trim.

Before his park district and political career, Kelly had served as an aerial gunner in the United States Marine Corps, and played professional basketball with the NBA's Oshkosh All-Stars. Early life Kelly was born in 1924. Kelly grew up in a house located across from Seward Park at West Division and New Orleans Street on the Near North Side of Chicago. Kelly graduated from the all-boys St. Philip High School in 1942. Early career Kelly served as an aerial gunner in the United States Marine Corps. Kelley played on the all-service basketball team, and won a serviceman welterweight boxing championship. Kelley played professional basketball for the Oshkosh All-Stars of the NBA. His basketball career was ended by a knee injury. Kelly began his career in the Chicago Park District as a gym teacher at Welles Park. Kelly spent many years working in leadership roles for the Chicago Park District. He served a park board member as well as Assistant General Superintendent, serving in the latter role from 1969 through 1973. Kelly was involved in the planning the first Special Olympics. General Superintendent of Chicago Park District In 1972, Kelly was promoted to General Superintendent of the Chicago Park District, first serving as Acting Superintendent (and additionally retaining the title of Assistant Superintendent), until 1973 when he was permanently appointed by mayor Richard J. Daley as General Superintendent. He would hold this position until 1986. Kelly would later claim that, in accepting the role of General Superintendent in 1973, he turned down an offer from the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks owner Wesley Pavalon to serve as team's president. Kelly became a strong promoter of Soldier Field, the lakefront stadium owned and operated by the Chicago Park District. He worked hard to attract events to the venue, and to retain it as a home of the Chicago Bears football team, who had recently moved in there on an interim basis. He reestablished the stadium as a venue for concerts, starting with a 1975 concert by Aretha Franklin. In the 1970s, there was talk of possibly building a new stadium to serve as a new home to the Chicago Bears, which would compete with and jeopardize Soldier Field. Kelly worked to instead push for a renovation of Soldier Field. He worked with mayor Richard J. Daley on plans to possibly renovate the stadium. By late, 1977, Daley had come to agree to support a $35 million to $50 million renovation that would have added an upper deck and hundreds of skyboxes to the stadium. However, on December 20, 1977, after earlier in the day having participated with Kelly in the opening of the new Park District field house, Daley died in office of a heart attack. Daley's successor Michael Bilandic again explored the idea of building a new stadium. Bilandic placed former governor Richard Ogilvie in charge of a task force to study the city's stadium situation, and Ogilvie proved to push for the task force to promote a new stadium over renovating Soldier Field. Kelly continued to work to promote plans for the renovation of Soldier Field, and got Bilandic to agree in 1978 to fund $3.5 million stopgap improvements of Soldier Field, including replacing the temporary seating in the north grandstand of the stadium with a permanent structure. When, in 1979, Jane Byrne was elected mayor, Kelly's push to renovate the stadium received a boon, as Byrne came to oppose building a new stadium, and came to support a $30 million plan to renovate the stadium. This renovation, which ultimately cost $32 million, was completed by 1982. Kelly was known for his contributions to youth programs in the city, with a 1975 Chicago Tribune profile on him once declaring, \\"If Mayor Daley is the man who makes Chicago work, then Ed Kelly is the man who makes it play.\\" In 1982, a discrimination lawsuit was filed against the Chicago Park District which claimed that in Kelly's tenure they had neglected facilities in black and hispanic neighborhoods while enhancing facilities and programs in white neighborhoods. A year later, while not admitting to discrimination, the Chicago Park District entered into a federal consent decree in which they agreed to spend more money in black and hispanic neighborhoods. Kelly got into disputes with the Friends of the Parks advocacy group, as well as mayor Harold Washington (who took office in 1983). Friends of the Parks and other civic groups urged Kelly to make reforms to the Park District. A constant critic of Kelly who was pushing him for reform was Chicago Park District Commissioner Walter Netsch. Also in 1986, Washington diminished Kelly's power by installing new park commissioners. After this, Kelly resigned his position as General Superintendent in July 1986. 47th Ward Democratic Committeeman From 1968 through 2004, Kelly served as the 47th Ward Democratic Committeeman. Kelly was elected committeeman in 1968. He had run for committeeman at the request of Mayor Daley. Kelley as considered the Democrat political boss of the ward. Kelly built the ward's operation into one of the strongest Democratic ward operations in the city. In 1975, he recruited Eugene Schulter to run as the Democratic candidate for the ward. Schulter successfully unseated the ward's Republican longtime alderman John J. Hoellen Jr., a significant foe of mayor Daley. Kelly mixed his duty as Committeeman with his duty as General Superintendent of the Chicago Park District, giving precinct workers with park district jobs (as patronage). By the mid-1980s, with the exception of the mayor, Kelly was considered to have the strongest patronage of Democratic Party leaders in the city. In the 1983 Chicago mayoral election, Kelly endorsed incumbent mayor Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary. Kelly was the first Democratic Ward Committeeman to endorse Republican Bernard Epton over Democratic nominee Harold Washington in the general election. In the 1987 Chicago mayoral election, he endorsed Chicago First nominee Thomas Hynes, who ultimately withdrew two days before the election. In 2000, Eugene Schulter made an attempt to challenge Kelly for the 47th Ward committemanship. Kelly narrowly defeated him in the election. In retaliation, for the ward's 2003 aldermanic election, Kelly backed John \\"Jack\\" Lydon's unsuccessful attempt to unseat Schulter. In late-2003, Kelly announce that he would be retiring as the ward's committeeman. Eugene Schulter was elected in 2004 to succeed him as the ward's committeeman. Possible pursuit of higher office In 1986, Kelly had been encouraged by some to run for the chairmanship of the Cook County Democratic Party, but he declined to challenge Edward Vrdolyak, the incumbent chairman who was seeking reelection to the position, and with whom Kelly was friendly. A powerful figure in Chicago politics, it had been speculated that he might run for mayor. He had considered running in the mid-1980s. When he resigned from his position as General Superintendent of the Chicago Park District, he vowed to \\"get even\\" with mayor Washington in 1987. He considered a possible run in the 1987 mayoral election. He had made plans to run in the 1989 mayoral special election, considering both the possibility of seeking the Republican and Democratic nominations, before opting to make plans to seek the Democratic nomination.

As a result, Corbin ran concurrently in both races. 2012 South Carolina Senate Corbin ran concurrently in this race and the State House race after Phillip Shoopman announced that he would not run for reelection.

And you know, a rib is a lesser cut of meat.\\" Corbin later apologized, claiming that the comment was made \\"in jest\\", and additionally said that Shealy \\"chose to be offended and make a big deal out of all this\\". Shealy, in addition to accepting Corbin's apology, later responded that \\"whether the person speaking them thinks they are in jest or not, these words are hurtful and disrespectful.\\" In addition, Corbin has allegedly remarked that women \\"do not belong in the South Carolina General Assembly\\", but rather \\"at home baking cookies\\" or \\"barefoot and pregnant\\".

Dunn (born June 25, 1923) is a decorated U.S. Army veteran of World War II and founder of Plaskolite LLC. He served as a member of the 86th Mountain Infantry Regiment (10th Mountain Division) in the Allied campaign in Northern Italy in 1945. In the final offensive in April 1945, Dunn led a platoon of men up to Hill 775 in the Apennine Mountains and was wounded by a sniper. For his heroism, he was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart.  Early life  Donald G. Dunn was born June 25, 1923 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut before volunteering at the age of 18 to join the United States Army.  Military service  Dunn was trained at Camp Hale, Colorado, before deploying to Italy as a member of the 2nd Platoon, Company G, 86th Mountain Infantry Regiment, 10th Mountain Infantry Division. His first combat engagement came in March 1945 near the village of Iola in the Apennine Mountains in Northern Italy. The Fifth United States Army commenced its final offensive on the Italian front, Operation Craftsman, on April 14. On the first day of the offensive Company G, under the command of Captain Ridgway Foust, advanced to Rocca di Roffeno, coming under heavy artillery fire during the night. The next day Company G continued the attack against faltering German resistance. At 1600 hours Dunn led his platoon in an attack to seize Hill 775, which was defended by German infantry and a machine gun emplacement. Dunn personally led his soldiers across a narrow valley and onto the slopes of Hill 775, when machine gun fired pinned down the unit. Dunn ordered a fire team led by Corporal Harding Shelby to envelop the Germans by advancing up a draw, but Shelby and his soldiers were killed in the attempt to outflank the German positions. A sniper on the far side of the valley then began to pick off the remaining men, hitting them from behind. Wounded in the chest, Dunn decided to continue the attack and led his men up the hill. The Germans withdrew, leaving the American soldiers in possession of this key piece of terrain. The engagement expedited the advance of the 10th Mountain Division into the Po River Valley. For his heroism on Hill 775, Dunn was awarded the Silver Star and Purple Heart. National Archives and Records Administration II, Record Group 407, 310-0.1 His other awards and decorations include the Bronze Star and Combat Infantrymen's Badge.  Post-War career  Dunn returned to the United States and invested in Plaskolite, Inc., a small company that manufactured drinking straws and fly swatters. After his partner unexpectedly departed with Dunn's investment capital and left the company nearly bankrupt, Dunn salvaged the business, turning it into the largest maker of thermoplastic (polycarbonate and acrylic) sheeting in North America. Dunn expanded its operations from making straws, fly swatters, and hula hoops to manufacturing lighting panels, mirrors, and other products for retail and commercial uses. Plaskolite's products today are found among other places in automobiles, signage, lighting, windows, kitchens, bathrooms, retail displays, and eyewear. The company today produces thermoplastic products in the United States, Mexico, and Turkey, employing more than 1,200 people. Dunn turned the leadership of the company over to his son James in the 1980s, but remained involved in the company until its sale to a private equity firm in 2015. He continues to be active in politics and education. To honor his wartime service, in 2013 the Dunn family founded the Donald G. and Mary A. Dunn Chair of Modern Military History at The Ohio State University.  Personal life  Dunn married Mary Elizabeth Altmaier in 1948 after graduating from Wesleyan University. The two then moved to Columbus, Ohio, where they raised five children: Robert, Andrew, James, Gardner, and Nancy. Mary Dunn passed away in 1996.

(Arabic: ÿ•ŸäÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÑÿßŸÇ ‚Äôiiad alhilaq) a 32-year-old autistic Palestinian man, was shot and killed by Israeli Police after not stopping at the Lions' Gate checkpoint in Jerusalem when he was ordered to do so by officers stationed nearby. He fled from the area and police attempted to \\"neutralize\\" Halaq during the chase with at least seven shots fired in his direction. Halaq's relatives have stated that he was an autistic man who was heading to a school for students with special needs, that he attended daily when he was shot by police. Friends and family of Halaq and the Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, Saab Erekat, have drawn parallels with police brutality in the United States and the killing of George Floyd.  Incident  Halaq and his teacher were walking on 30 May 2020 to the Elwyn El Quds center which provides services for children and adults with disabilities when they approached the Lions' Gate checkpoint. The checkpoint was part of the daily walk from Halaq's home in East Jerusalem's Wadi al-Joz area to the special-needs center in the Old City, which he had attended since 2014. When he reportedly stepped through the arches of the Gate, officers on duty became suspicious when he placed his hand into his pocket for his cell phone. He had apparently not understood the shouted commands from the officers to halt, but fled on foot and hid in a garbage room. His father told reporters that the teacher attempted to tell police that Halaq was disabled and to check his identity, but officers maintained a distance and opened fire. In a statement the Israeli police claimed that Halaq was believed to be carrying a weapon after officers spotted an object that looked like a pistol. When he failed to obey their calls to halt, officers gave chase. A local television station reported that he was chased into a dead-end alley, and a senior officer orders a halt in fire after entering the alley. A second officer reportedly ignored orders and fired about six or seven shots from a M-16 rifle which killed Halaq. He was found to not be in possession of a weapon when he was searched after his death.  Investigation  Following protocol the officers involved in the shooting were questioned afterwards, and one issued a statement of condolences to Halaq's family through his lawyer in an interview with Israeli Army Radio. Reportedly the officer who continued to fire was a new recruit and his lawyer has argued that the thought he was in real danger. Relatives of Halaq have demanded any footage of the killing and chase be used in the investigation and for the family to be able to view it, as the Old City is covered extensively by security cameras.  Aftermath  Mural depicting Eyad al-Hallaq in Bethlehem. A protest was staged in front of the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem on 2 June, against police brutality and the deaths of George Floyd and Halaq, following similar protests in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv on 30 May. Others used social media to protest with the hashtag #PalestinianLivesMatter while over a thousand mourners attended his funeral.  Reactions  Halaq's sister Diana told reporters that the police officer who shot her brother should be imprisoned but that she believed the officer would remain unpunished as her family were Palestinian. The leader of the main Arab party in Parliament, Ayman Odeh, echoed concerns about the lack of punishment for the officers, using Twitter to post concerns about an \\"expected cover-up\\" and that justice would only be done when the \\"Palestinian people know freedom and independence\\". Benny Gantz, the Alternate Prime Minister of Israel, discussed the issue at a weekly meeting of the Israeli cabinet the next day, stating the government was sorry about the incident and shared in the families grief while calling for a swift investigation. Benjamin Netanyahu was also in attendance and did not comment on the incident. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the killing a \\"war crime\\" and Hamas issued warnings of a new intifada. The United Nations' Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called the killing another case of \\"the routine use of lethal force by Israeli Security forces against Palestinians in Gaza and in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\\". The statement continued by stressing the need for the least force possible to be used in any situation. It has also charged Israel with not being transparent about the rules of engagement, that were against international law regulations. On 7 June 2020, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed his condolences and said that he \\"expected a full investigation into the matter.\\" He also said the incident was a \\"tragedy.\\"  See also  * Extrajudicial killing * List of violent incidents in the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, 2020  Notes  References  Category:2020 deaths Category:2020s in police brutality Category:2020 scandals Category:2020s in Jerusalem Category:May 2020 events in Asia Category:Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict in Jerusalem Category:Deaths by firearm in the West Bank Category:People killed by Israeli security forces ","title":"Shooting of Eyad al-Hallaq"},{"id":"64165805","text":"The 100th Massachusetts General Court, consisting of the Massachusetts Senate and the Massachusetts House of Representatives, met in 1879 during the governorship of Thomas Talbot.

Our Lady of Ferguson depicts the Virgin Mary as a Black Madonna, holding her hands up. Where her womb would be located, there is a small black silhouette of the Child Jesus, with the Sacred Heart of Jesus, also with his hands and arms extended, in the crosshairs of a gun. The posture taken by both Jesus and Mary are a reference to \\"Hands up, don't shoot\\", a popular slogan associated with protesting police brutality after the Shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The position of the hands is also in the orans posture found in other Christian icons. The icon focuses on Marian intercession against police brutality and gun violence, particularly towards people of color. The icon received publicity after Father James Martin, an American Jesuit priest and author, shared a photograph of the icon on Facebook on June 9, 2016. In his post, Martin wrote \\"Our Lady prays for all who are targeted by gun violence: African-Americans, the poor and marginalized, and police officers. All are her children.

He was the son of Abraham Jeremias Polak, a dealer in textiles, and Jeanette Rosenthal. Career In September of 1913 Polak stayed in Berlin for six weeks to study with the photographer Karl Schenker, whom he had met in London. Schenker helped improve his technique and taught him various skills, including retouching. His photographic career was short, starting in 1912 and ending three years later because he suffered from bad health (severe asthma). In January 1915 he was elected to the London Salon of Photography. He sought to reproduce the domestic interiors seen in the paintings of 17th-century Dutch painters Johannes Vermeer and Jan Steen. He found it difficult to rent a suitable studio but eventually discovered the ideal room on the Houttuin Rotterdam with a good north light, the only drawback being that one had to approach it through a trap door. He then spent a considerable amount of money furnishing this with accessories bought at antique shops. He then photographed actors dressed in attires typical of that time. Subsequent life In 1917, he married Ila Lucie Colclough (d. 30 May 1951),https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/39497/page/1662/data.pdf who originated from London. He moved to Lausanne in 1932.

He was active assisting Dutch war refugees in Switzerland; Polak and received the Zilveren Erkentelijkheidsmedaille (Silver Medal of Recognition) from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1946. In 1950, he was made a Knight in the Order of Orange-Nassau. He died in Lausanne in 1957. Legacy His major work was a folio of pictures, \\"Photographs from Life in Old Dutch Costume\\" published in 1923, which includes an introduction by the British art photographer F.J. Mortimer. His best-known picture is \\"Artist and his Model\\" (1914). Despite critics contending that his work was repetitive and that he made unsuccessful attempts at recreating scenes from the past, he has since become the subject of some retrospectives.

Carlson, J. F. (2018, August). Happy 80th birthday to the Mental Measurements Yearbook: The life and legacy of Oscar K. Buros. Paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association, New York, NY. She painted what she saw, consistent with the realism style. Many of her watercolors depict neighborhood scenes in Highland Park. ‚ÄúOn her oils, people are treated with dignity and respect‚Äù (p. 313). A number of her original paintings are on display throughout the Buros Center for Testing in offices, the conference room, and the library. She was the recipient of numerous art awards and honors, including the Association for Assessment in Counseling's Exemplary Practices Award, which she received in 1995. Despite her success in these artistic endeavors, in the mid 1930s Buros dedicated herself to helping her husband fulfill his professional mission in the field of measurement. For a while she continued painting but eventually abandoned her career to work exclusively as her husband‚Äôs partner. Buros was responsible for creating the design and layout template for the Yearbooks, which is still used today. From 1938 to 1978, the couple published eight volumes of the Mental Measurements Yearbook series out of the basement of their home in Highland Park, New Jersey. When Oscar died in 1978, with the 8th MMY not quite completed, Buros finished the work by herself, publishing the book on schedule. She is the only woman named to the \\"Famous Women in Testing\\" roster who did not have an advanced degree of any kind, let alone in a measurement-related field. She then worked to ensure that her husband's legacy would continue and his work be carried on in perpetuity. In 1979 she oversaw the process of moving the Buros Institute, as the Center was then called, along with all its holdings, to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.Spies, R. (2010).

In 1994, Buros provided a substantial gift to expand the original mission beyond the evaluation of commercially available tests. Buros was the founding contributor to the journal, Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, published currently by the American Psychological Association (APA). In describing her commitment to social causes, psychologist Milton Schwebel (1992) characterized Buros as ‚Äúa pillar of strength, her principles uneroded by age or economic well-being, her determination to struggle against social evils undiminished.‚Äù She funded an endowment to ensure the continuation of the journal in perpetuity. The journal became‚Äîand continues to be‚Äîthe official journal of APA‚Äôs Division 48: Society for the Study of Peace, Conflict and Violence: Peace Psychology Division. Shortly after her second major contribution to this cause, Buros passed away, on June 22, 1995.

It is his third book in the Jack Ryan series. Set in the Tom Clancy universe, President Ryan deals with the imprisonment of his friend and former CIA colleague, Jesuit priest Pat West, in Indonesia. Meanwhile, The Campus search for next-generation AI technology before the Chinese military can use it for nefarious purposes. Plot summary In Indonesia, software engineer Geoff Noonan secretly sells the computer program Calliope to Suparman Games, an Indonesian gaming company. Soon after, he is lured into a honey trap by Wu Chao, an agent working for the cyber warfare division of the Chinese PLA. Along with his assassin Kang, Chao blackmails him into giving them a copy of Calliope, intending to exploit its next-generation AI capabilities to hack into American military computer systems. The next day, Noonan turns to Jesuit priest Pat West for help; however, Chao and Kang catch up to them. They murder the former and have the priest arrested by the Indonesian police for made-up charges of blasphemy against Islam. However, Father West, a former CIA officer, manages to send a private text message about his encounter with Noonan to his friend, U.S. President Jack Ryan. Upon receiving the text message from Father West, President Ryan discreetly orders the Campus to investigate the priest‚Äôs text message. After pleading for the release of Father West to the Indonesian president to no avail, he decides to make a state visit to Indonesia. Meanwhile, the priest is speedily convicted of smuggling heroin and sentenced to death in the country‚Äôs Execution Island. The Campus tracks down Noonan‚Äôs colleague Todd Ackerman, who is in hiding in New Zealand. However, they find him dead, murdered by PLA agents. After finding out about the sale, they proceed to Indonesia to break into the headquarters of Suparman Games and retrieve the purchased copy of Calliope. However, Suparman‚Äôs henchmen abduct Campus operative Domingo ‚ÄúDing‚Äù Chavez. In China, General Bai Min prepares FIRESHIP, a military operation that aims to utilize Calliope. The program is uploaded by a Chinese agent into an American communications company‚Äôs computer system. Afterwards, Chao and Kang attempt to assassinate Peter Li, an ex-Navy admiral working for the company, as well as his family. However, he fights back by killing Chao and another henchman, and flees with his pregnant wife and children. He later enlists his friend John Clark's help. President Ryan receives intelligence on Chinese general Song Biming‚Äôs granddaughter, who is suffering from retinoblastoma and is about to be brought to the United States for a surgical operation. He reluctantly allows his wife Cathy Ryan to covertly make contact with the general, who is known to be at odds with General Bai. The operation is a success, and afterwards General Song discreetly passes information on FIRESHIP to Dr. Ryan. In Indonesia, the Campus rescue Chavez from his captors and retrieve Calliope in the Suparman headquarters. However, they are separated when Suparman's henchmen chase them to an airfield. With Calliope in tow, Chavez and colleague Adara Sherman hijack an aircraft smuggling heroin, crashing into a nearby island. They eventually call for air support from , which eventually rescues them. Chavez then informs ship captain Jimmy Akana about Calliope. Meanwhile, senator Michelle Chadwick finds herself blackmailed by her lover, PLA operative David Huang, into spying on her political rival President Ryan. She eventually informs President Ryan and joins him on his trip to Indonesia, where he tells the Indonesian president of China's plans. The latter releases Father West from prison, and General Bai and Huang are eventually arrested by their respective governments. After embedding itself to several military communications systems, Calliope makes contact with an American F-35 stealth fighter in the middle of a training exercise in the Pacific Ocean. The application launches a cruise missile from the aircraft, steering it toward a waiting Chinese trawler. , having been informed of Calliope's capabilities by Akana, quickly detects the application and deletes it from its computer system. Navy SEALs then retake the trawler with the stolen missile. In Chicago, Clark lures Kang and his men to an ambush. However, a wounded Kang escapes and boards a train for Los Angeles. Clark follows and tracks him down, killing him.

It was first described in 1817 by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle as Hemistemma lechenaultii, using a specimen collected on St Francis Island, South Australia but in 1866 Henri Ernest Baillon Beyeria assigned the species to the genus, Beyeria. The specific epithet, lechenaultii, honours the French botanist, Jean-Baptiste Leschenault de La Tour.  Description  Beyeria lechenaultii is a sticky shrub which grows up to 1.5 m high. Its leaves are oblong to linear, and the margins are sometimes recurved. The lower surfaces are woolly except on the midrib. The male flowers are found in groups of one to three, on a sticky stalk which is 1-6 mm long. The sepals of the male flowers are plus or minus sticky. The female flowers are solitary on whitish stalks which lengthen when in fruit. The sepals of the female flowers are about 2 mm long and whitish. The stigma has 3 broad recurved (curved backwards) lobes at its base. The capsule is ovoid to globose, and the stigma persists. It usually has three seeds which are about 5 mm long and reddish- brown. It flowers in spring. In New South Wales it is usually an understorey shrub in mallee communities. Uses The Noongar people of southwest Western Australia drank decoctions of the leaves to treat tuberculosis and fevers.

The house was 16m long, 5m deep and 6m high; the walls were 3 feet thick on average, built from 120 kg blocks of ice. During construction, they carried out scientific experiments, including attempts at glaciology. The veranda with carved gables divided the house into two parts. Each part contains two rooms: there was a living room, a dining room, a bedroom and a toilet. Furniture and household items were made of ice. In one of the rooms there were two mirrors, a dressing table, some candlesticks, a large bed, a chair and a fireplace with ice firewood. The second room contained a carved table, two sofas, two armchairs and a small cupboard for a tea service with glasses as well as for wine glasses and dishes. The corners of the room were decorated with two statues of Cupid. Since the ice palace and festivities were part of the celebration of Russia's victory over the Ottoman Empire to the right of the house stood a life-size elephant and a group of Persians made of ice.

The highlight was the \\"Wedding\\" of tsarina jester Prince Golitsyn, Mikhail Alekseevich on February 6 (17), 1740. The Christian Kalmuckin Avdotja Buscheninowa had complained to Anna about her loneliness. After Golitsyn secretly married an Italian and accepted the Catholic faith, Anna had made him a court jester and now forced him to marry this \\"girl of the lowest ethnic class\\". After the church wedding, the bride and groom were placed in a large cage carried by an elephant and accompanied by over 400 people, some of whom rode camels, some sledged by reindeer, pigs, dogs, goats and cats.

She specialises in anxiety disorders in children and young people.  Education  Creswell was educated at University of Oxford, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. She later qualified as a Clinical Psychologist at University College London followed by a PhD in 2004.  Research and career  Creswell joined the University of Reading as a research fellow in 2003, where she was later promoted to a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Research Professorship. At the University of Reading she led the Anxiety and Depression in Children and Young People clinic (AnDY). Creswell studies why some children develop anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders often emerge before the age of 12 and develop in preadolescence. and although 6.5% of children suffer from anxiety disorders, only 2% of those who meet the diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder seek any effective treatment. In fact, only around 40% of families of children with children seek any type of help. She has studied how interactions between children and their parents can maintain or break vicious cycles associated with child anxiety. As part of this work, Creswell showed that children of anxious parents are more likely to become anxious, but that this likely reflects a complex interaction of child, parent, and other characteristics For example, she showed that anxious children were more aware of signals from their parents; and that non-anxious children were less likely to be influenced by what their parents were doing. As a result of this work, she developed a therapist-guided, parent-led cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for the management of child anxiety disorders, which is a now available on the National Health Service (NHS). She demonstrated that only 5 hours of therapist-supported training was enough to support parents in helping their children tackle anxiety.. She joined the University of Oxford in 2019. At Oxford, Creswell leads the Emerging Minds Mental Health Network. Emerging Minds is a network that looks to reduce the number of children who experience mental health challenges. Creswell is a member of the scientific advisory group of Evidence to Impact, an not-for-profit organisation that looks to improve public health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Creswell co-led the Co- SPACE (COVID‚Äì19 Supporting Parents, Adolescents and Children during Epidemics). Co-SPACE looks to understand how families cope with coronavirus disease and the impact of the pandemic on children and young people's mental health. In May 2020, the first round of results from the Co-SPACE study, showing that work and their children's wellbeing was the most frequent source of stress for parents.

The law, which had been passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China on 30 June and come into effect on the same day, was widely seen as having the purpose of curbing opposition, in a broad sense, against the Chinese Communist Party in the city. The law had direct relevance to the protests, as it prescribes harsh penalties for the tactics that protesters had commonly used. Nevertheless, sizeable protests erupted throughout the city on occasion of the 1 July protests the next day, resulting in about 370 arrests, including at least ten on charges under the new law. The Hong Kong government, faced with the task of implementing a law that had been drafted and promulgated without substantial involvement by its own officials, was seen widely, including in the academic and media sectors, as being unable to draw a clear demarcation line between which acts would constitute punishable offences under the law, and which would not. The vagueness of the law, while refused by the city's police chief, was seen by pro-democrats and observers as a deliberate device to amplify its deterrence effect. While the law immediately created a chilling effect, smaller protests continued into the month. During these, protesters sometimes used inventive means to adapt, such as holding up blank sheets of paper, or singing the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong with numbers instead of lyrics. The month ended with major suppression activities by the local government, including the arrest of four student activists and a ban on twelve pan- democratic candidates for the legislative council election in September. In justifying the disqualifications, the Hong Kong government stated that the candidates had intended to breach the national security law once elected. On 31 July, the Hong Kong government announced that the election would be deferred by a year due to the worsening of the COVID-19 crisis. Already before the disqualifications of opposition candidates, there were calls by pro- democrats in Hong Kong and their sympathizers abroad for increasing international pressure on China to change its politics regarding Hong Kong. Furthermore, there were calls on Western countries to provide safe havens for protesters through temporary residence and to create pathways for immigration. Several Western countries took steps to respond to the latter requests, as the United Kingdom had already done earlier, with these steps being sharply criticized by mainland Chinese officials. In relation to non-governmental activism, it was noted internationally that the security law expressly states (in its Article 38) that it also applies to non-Hong Kong permanent residents located outside of Hong Kong.  Events  1 July = National Security Law comes into effect The Hong Kong national security law came into effect 23:00 HKT on 30th June, which criminalized advocating \\"secession\\" and \\"obstruction\\" of the Chinese government. Police continued to use the coronavirus law, which aimed at discouraging public assembly, to ban the annual July 1 peaceful march.  Marches against National Security Law  Despite police ban, tens of thousands of protesters showed up, alongside heavy police presence, to Causeway Bay, Wan Chai, Tin Hau and lingered in the area for almost six hours to voice their objection against the newly implemented national security law. The police responded by deploying water cannon at journalists and protesters and dispersed many tear gas and pepper balls. A journalist was knocked down by a police water cannon truck. According to an official police statement, they have \\"acted with restraint\\" and arrested about 370 people for various charges, among whom at least ten people for breaching \\"national security\\" for displaying or possessing pro-democracy flags, placards, or protest art. One police officer was \\"injured with a sharp object\\" in a physical conflict. In the evening, a suspect was escorted off a flight bound for London at Chek Lap Kok Airport by airport police and arrested on charges related to protests earlier in the day. An anonymous woman who held up a blank sheet of paper near a police cordon gained widespread attention following a photojournalist report. \\"The girl with blank sheets\\" would inspire many more to protest the curtailment of the freedom of expression by holding up blank placards.  UK response to the National Security Law  Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared in the House of Commons that the Hong Kong National Security Law was a \\"clear and serious breach\\" of the 1984 Sino- British Joint Declaration. Johnson also announced plans to extend UK residency rights to British National (Overseas) of Hong Kong passport holders and their dependents who would be permitted to apply for five-year visas to reside in the UK, including the right to work and study without restrictions. After five years they can, under normal British nationality law, apply for settled status and then subsequently for citizenship.  South Korea solidarity march  A group of students and social activists marched in front of Seoul's Walt Disney Company office in support of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. They demanded Disney to scrap the release of the movie Mulan. Its lead actress, Crystal Liu Yifei, had made pro-police comments on mainland social media in August 2019 which had caused a backlash on Western social media including Twitter. The protest group stated that Mulan, a legendary female warrior, represented freedom of oppression, and should not be played by someone who \\"contributed to suppressing the people of Hong Kong\\". = 2 July = International responses  The United States Congress unanimously passed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act after Senate approval seven days earlier, on June 25. The Australian government began drafting a Hong Kong safe haven pathway for pro-democracy Hong Kong protesters. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated that offering support to threatened Hong Kong people was \\"very consistent with who we are as a people and very consistent practically with the views that we've expressed.\\"  Other developments  Democracy activist Nathan Law announced that he had left Hong Kong for an undisclosed location, out of safety concerns. Days later it became known that he was in London. = 3 July = Hong Kong government actions  A man arrested on July 1 becomes the first person being charged of \\"breaching the national security law\\", articles 21 and 22 and of terrorism, article 24. Hong Kong Education Bureau sent a late night notice to all schools in Hong Kong demanding that the newly enacted national security legislation will be taught and enforced in all public and private schools, including special education schools, in every single grade level starting in Kindergarten. The Bureau will support developing curriculum and assessment, the notice stated, and requests all stake holders ‚Äì educators, administrators, social workers ‚Äì work together to \\"enhance national identity\\". The court extended a restraining order against the grassroot Facebook SupportPolice group over the unauthorized posting of an arrested 15-year-old protester mugshot-like photo, while in police custody, onto its Facebook page. The photo has been circulated in Instagram, WeChat, and other social media and the boy and his family were subject to intimidation and harassment. The original court order was to expire on July 3rd. According to Stand News, the boy was arrested on the 24th May for unlawful gathering in Mong Kok, released on the 26th, with his photo posted to SupportPoliceGroup Facebook page and other pro-police forums on the 25th. Facebook has not responded to the boy‚Äôs lawyer at the time of court hearing.  International response against National Security Law  The government of Canada announced that it would suspend its extradition agreement with Hong Kong in response to the provisions of the Hong Kong national security law. Furthermore, Canada is considering a \\"pathway to citizenship\\", a priority point system, to accept young (18-23 years old), university-bound students who have been participating in the pro-democracy protests. The eligibility of applicants of the scheme could be limited to those between the age of 18-35. Japanese legislators were asking the Japanese government to cancel the summit and state visit of Xi Jinping. The draft resolution stated that Japan should not ignore the worsening situation and should take a stance to show support to the Hong Kong pro-democracy citizens. A total of 27 countries' governments condemned the national security law: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Belize, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland, Ireland, Germany, Japan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Marshall Islands, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Palau, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K. Global human rights advocacy group NOW! launched #FridaysForFreedom until September 3 in support of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. Participants are asked to stand in front of their country's Chinese embassy and consulate with related Hong Kong signage.  International support for National Security Law  Facing international criticism regarding authoritarian policy making of the Hong Kong national security law and its alleged human rights violation, the Chinese state-run newspaper Global Times published an article which claimed that more than 53 countries in the world support China and its national security law on Hong Kong. The list of supporting countries as uncovered by Axios comprised: China, Antigua and Barbuda, Bahrain, Belarus, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Comoros, Congo- Brazzaville, Cuba, Djibouti, Dominica, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Gabon, Gambia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Lesotho, Mauritania, Morocco, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Niger, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Syria, Tajikistan, Togo, UAE, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia and Zimbabwe.  Other developments  The State Council of China appointed Zheng Yanxiong as director of the National Security Office. = 4 July = Hong Kong public libraries censor pro-democracy literature  Freedom of press, of publication, and of information are guaranteed by Hong Kong Basic Law Article 27, but according to multiple newspapers and confirmed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) of Hong Kong in a query by RTHK, various libraries in Hong Kong have begun reviewing their collections for items deemed violating the national security law. Such books will not be available on the catalog for reference or for borrowing in the meantime. An AFP reporter was unable to locate books written by activist Joshua Wong, pro-democratic lawmaker Tanya Chan and local scholar Chin Wan at a local library branch in the afternoon of 4 July. The library staff said that the collection of books was not large, and that not all books by those authors involved are reviewed. The RTHK article rendered a statement by LCSD which said that the collections of the Hong Kong Public Library must comply with the provisions of and not violate Hong Kong laws. However, according to the IFLA/UNESCO Public Library Manifesto 1994 mentioned in the LCSD Public Library page, the collections and services of public libraries \\"should not be subject to any ideological, political or religious censorship, [...]\\". In addition to the possibility of violating the Manifesto, foreign media were also alarmed by the removal of such books and expressed concerns that Hong Kong‚Äôs speech and academic freedom would be under pressure. In fact, although many university presidents had jointly announced support for the national security law on June 1, a month before the details were announced, and although they vowed to protect academic freedom at the universities, many university professors expressed concern when interviewed by Science magazine. As for local bookstores, the books removed from the library are still on sale in parts of Hong Kong. In the bookstores of Mong Kok and Causeway Bay, some bookstore staff explained that these books were older and may only have fewer reprints. In one of the bookstores in Mong Kok, a collection of \\"Rebellion under Tyranny\\" published by the Chinese Christian Church, the words \\"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times\\" on the back cover of the book were covered by adhesive tape.  DNA samples taken from arrestees  South China Morning Post reported that the 10 individuals arrested and charged of violating the newly enacted national security law have had their hair and saliva DNA samples taken by the police. Citing Police Force Ordinance 59C(2a), police claimed it is within the law that they collect these 10 arrestees' DNA samples. However, 59C states that the police is only authorized to collect non-intimate samples when two conditions are simultaneously met: one, that they suspect that \\"the person from whom the non- intimate sample is to be taken has committed a serious arrestable offence\\", and two, that they believe \\"the sample will tend to confirm or disprove the commission of the offence by that person\\"[59C(2b)] It is unclear how the possessions of pro-democracy verbiage flags, flyers, and stickers can be classified as \\"serious arrestable offense\\", nor was it necessary to prove that the alleged offence was committed by the person (from whom the DNA sample was taken) in this case. According to Hong Kong lawyer Lawrence Lok Ying-kam who specializes in criminal cases, Hong Kong police is not authorized to take sample in this case, and he speculated that the main purpose of extracting DNA is to intimidate the arrestees. = 5 July = Discrepancies between Chinese and English versions of the national security law  The Official Languages Ordinance of Hong Kong has always granted equal legal status to legislation in both Chinese and English. When the Chinese version of the National Security Law passed on June 30th in Beijing, there was no complete, Hong Kong official English version immediately available on the government website; only a 3-paragraph on the first page of the Chinese version footnoting the official English name of the law was gazetted on the website, and a separate English version published via GoogleDoc on Xinhua official website. Discrepancies between the two versions begin to surface after days of analyzing and comparing the two. Lawyer Alan Wong Hok-ming pointed out a few \\"poor translations\\" from article 9, 10, and 29, for example, where the word \\"Universities\\" were added in the English version that was not found in the Chinese version. When asked by South China Morning Post, the Department of Justice confirmed that Chinese would be the official language of the new law because \\"it was a national law enacted by the standing committee [of National People's Congress in Beijing]\\". Basic Law Committee member Priscilla Leung Mei-fun also defended the government‚Äôs decision of Chinese prevailing over English, but legal experts questioned the legality of such claim. For example, English-speaking judges of Hong Kong who can't read Chinese may not be able to uphold justice when the law was not gazetted officially in English, and the court cannot assume English-speaking-only citizens' knowledge of the Chinese version, a former assistant solicitor general of the colonial-era Legal Department Michael Blanchflower stated. To some, the discrepancies between Chinese and the unofficial English version of the law played well into the on- going judges selection debate. In fact, although Carrie Lam rejected calls to use only Chinese nationals to preside over cases and brushed it off as \\"unrealistic\\", one day later, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People‚Äôs Congress Standing Committee, made statements that superseded those of Lam, through voicing his concerns that judges heading national security cases should be Chinese nationals only to avoid justice being compromised by ‚Äúdual allegiance‚Äù because of their foreign nationality.  Boycott Mulan movement  The #BoycottMulan hashtag has begun to resurface in Thailand. Concurrent with the recent South Korea protest on July 1 demanding that the film Mulan be scrapped, Thai users have been trending #BoycottMulan to show solidarity with the Hong Kong pro-demoncracy protest movement against China‚Äôs national security law. To many, Mulan, the legendary female warrior who disguised as a man to join the army in the place of her father, symbolizes a freedom fighter against oppression. The hashtag #BoycottMulan began last year in August when pro-China naturalized American citizen Liu Yifei posted on Twitter that she supported the Hong Kong police. Days later, Twitter reportedly shut down more than 200,000 \\"#SupportMulan\\" accounts. = 6 July = Blank sheet protests  A \\"Lunch with You\\" event took place at IFC mall in Central. Pixelated slogans, along with white sheets of paper, were held up. Police arrived later and conducted stop and search. Protected by Hong Kong Basic Law Article 27 to peaceful assembly, demonstration, and processions, many gathered in the apm mall in Kwun Tong with blank sheets to protest the National Security Law's restrictions to the freedom of expression, following a viral news article from July 1st about a girl who held up a blank placard while watching police round up protesters nearby. Police entered the shopping mall by force and arrested three middle- aged women on charges of \\"obstructing the police\\". A total of 8 were arrested on various charges.  RTHK interview with US Consul General  Hanscom Smith, US Consul General to Hong Kong and Macau, joined the RTHK radio interview Money Talk discussing Hong Kong‚Äôs recent national security law and its impact on Hong Kong. Smith reiterated that the Beijing encroachment of Hong Kong‚Äôs \\"high degree of autonomy\\" (Hong Kong Basic Law, Article 2) is a sign of its insecurity. He urged Beijing to not treat Hong Kong like it treats its other mainland cities, and let Hong Kong be Hong Kong. He stated that it‚Äôs the opaque handling of the law that didn‚Äôt follow Hong Kong legislative processes that creates uncertainty to the society. When questioned by the host how he justifies other countries such as the US also have similar national security legislation, Smith stated that the US is a democratic country that follows legislative protocols with checks and balances, and Beijing has none. Hours later, Hong Kong government stated its disagreement with Smith's position, and Chief Secretary of Administration Matthew Cheung and Secretary for Security John Lee will meet with Smith to express their concerns.  Review and removal of pro-democracy books from schools  Whereas Hong Kong Basic Law (Chapter 3) Article 27 guarantees freedom of speech, press, and information, and (Chapter 6) Article 137 guarantees educational institutions‚Äô autonomy and academic freedom, the Hong Kong Education Bureau has ordered schools to review and remove items from their curriculum and libraries that violate the newly enacted national security law, unless these books are to \\"positively teach\\" students. Critics of the national security law have long seen the national security law as a tool to silent dissent. The Education Bureau further reaffirmed to Reuters that because schools are the \\"gatekeepers\\" for their teaching resources, therefore school management and teachers should review \\"all teaching materials, including books\\" that may violate the national security law. Many school principals requested for more details and clarity. A Baptist University lecturer pointed out in a South China Morning Post interview, \\"books written by political leaders such as Nelson Mandela and Mahatma Gandhi [involving organising civil disobedience acts] may also be banned,\\" under the vague directive. = 7 July = Article 43 implementation rules effective immediately  Details have been vague in the newly Beijing-enacted national security law. Effective midnight of July 7th, the Article 43 Implementation Rules listed seven details ranging from freezing assets, limiting travels, to granting more power to police to conduct searches without warrants. Under Article 37, Hong Kong Basic Law prohibits \\"unlawful search of a citizen‚Äôs person\\". However, lawyer and Hong Kong Executive Council member Ronny Tong Ka-wah speculated that not requiring warrants before conducting searches can expedite arrest and \\"prevent evidence from being destroyed meanwhile\\". The rules continue to grant police power to ask social media platforms for user details whom they deem as national security threats. Facebook (and its subsidiary WhatsApp), Google, Twitter, and Telegram so far all expressed their refusal to comply while awaiting international consensus regarding the legality of the law. In an interview with Fortune, Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher with the nonprofit Human Rights Watch, stated that the law could be \\"easily abused by authorities to punish people for peacefully expressing critical views of the Chinese or Hong Kong government.\\" In the same article, Julian Gewirtz, a China expert and research fellow at Harvard, worried that companies which have been comfortably operating in Hong Kong are now suddenly burdened by the vague and legally ambiguous law.  IPAC for no Hong Kong extradition  The Inter- Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC) is a newly formed organization of 34 legislators from 16 democratic countries [the numbers since increased] dedicated to safeguarding international rules based order, upholding human rights, promoting trade fairness, strengthening security, protecting national integrity. Its first campaign is to convince countries not to allow extraditions to Hong Kong and to suspend extradition treaties with Hong Kong. Their website listed Australia, Czechia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States as IPAC member countries that have extradition treaties with Hong Kong. Overall, Hong Kong has extradition treaties with 39 territories. Canada had suspended its extradition treaty on 3 July and Australia did so on 9 July.  Australia enhanced travel warning  Australian government's official travel website updated its warning to travellers and to Australian passport holders residing in Hong Kong, advising the latter group: \\"If you‚Äôre concerned about the new law, reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong.\\" = 8 July = Converting a hotel into the National Security Office  The official Beijing-led National Security office was inaugurated in Causeway Bay, a Hong Kong protest hotspot, inside a 4-star hotel. The inaugural ceremony was held at 8am with water- filled barricades and heavy police presence. The public only learned of the arrangement the day before. Since about midnight heavy barricades were moved in, and the emblem of the People's Republic of China was placed on the front of the hotel entrance. During the ceremony reporters were not allowed through the barricades. The hotel, formerly known as MetroPark hotel managed by China's state-owned China Travel Service, has had a \\"construction in progress\\" sign for several days now, and its website is currently down for \\"maintenance\\", and according to Hong Kong Free Press, it‚Äôs been down for about a week. The office is leased for at least six months, and is termed \\"the most luxurious Chinese Communist Party office\\" by The News Lens.  Protest anthem banned in schools  Hours after the National Security office was unveiled, and only one day after Carrie Lam's public statement reaffirming that the National Security law \\"will not undermine human rights and freedoms\\", Education Bureau minister Kevin Yeung stated in a written response that pro- democracy protest-related activities such as forming human chains or chanting songs ‚Äì specifically the protest anthem Glory to Hong Kong ‚Äì are banned in all schools. Human chains, or the Baltic Way, is a peaceful political demonstration originated in 1989 by Baltic's pro-independence wishing to secede from the Communist Soviet Union. On the other hand, \\"Glory to Hong Kong\\", possibly inspired by \\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\" from Les Miserables, was a made-in-Hong-Kong, crowd-sourced, did-it-yourselves \\"protest anthem\\" that became world famous during the year-long protest movement. Whereas Article 27 of Hong Kong Basic Law guarantees citizens' freedom of speech, of \\"assembly, of procession and of demonstration\\", Yeung concluded that children's right to free expression \\"is not absolute\\" and requested that schools take action to prevent such \\"violations\\" from occurring.  Legality of the Legislative Council primaries  Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Erick Tsang stated in an interview with Oriental Daily News that the organizer of the primaries and the candidates may be in breach of National Security Law articles 20, 22, and 29. Whereas Hong Kong Basic Law article 26 guarantees citizens and permanent residents of Hong Kong ‚Äúthe right to vote and the right to stand for election in accordance with [the Basic] law,‚Äù Tsang warned citizens to pay heed to the potential violations of the ‚ÄúPrevention and Control of Disease (Requirement and Directions) (Business and Premises) Regulation (Cap. 599F), commonly known as social-distance regulation, to avoid citations and arrests. Pro-democracy legislators historically constituted less than half of the Legislative Council. In the wake of the year-long pro-democracy movement and after the record turnout and the landslide win in November‚Äôs District Council election, pro-democracy candidates began to emerge and vowed to take over more than half of the 70-seat Legislative Council election in September. It is hoped that this primary and its result would strategies their win against the pro-China majority party. In an earlier interview with the Stand News, Benny Tai, the organizer of this year‚Äôs primary and a Hong Kong University assistant professor in law, expressed that he is mentally ready for police disruption at polling stations, and he anticipated that the Hong Kong government will use any excuse to disqualify these pro-democracy candidates, both before and after the September election, something that the government has done in the past.  Hong Kong University Students' Union \\"Fear Not\\" statement  The Hong Kong University management began \\"cleaning up\\" protest banners and posters on campus. They argued that while there is a designated \\"Lennon Wall\\" space for free speech, the slogans \\"Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times\\", and \\"Hong Kong Independence\\" violated the newly Beijing-enacted National Security Law. In addition, they claimed that the structural poles and columns adjacent to the designated space were not part of the agreed space and therefore they, while respecting students' freedom of speech, would continue to periodically clean up any wordings deemed inappropriate or illegal. In response, on 8 July, the Hong Kong University Students' Union published a declaration on their Facebook page, with the title \\"Statement that the Hong Kong University Students' Union fears not of the National Security Law\\". In addition to restating their earlier opposition to the National Security Law, they also proclaimed that the insertion of the word \\"Universities\\" in the discrepant English version of the National Security Law had \\"dealt a blow\\" to the University's \\"[i]nstitutional autonomy and academic freedom\\". The statement concluded with a vow to \\"fight against malignancy.\\"  Protest-related journalism award  AFP photographer Anthony Wallace's coverage on the Hong Kong protest between June and December 2019 won this year‚Äôs Ville de Perignan Remi Ochlik Award in the Visa pour l'Image International Festival of Photojournalism. The title of his winning work was \\"Opposing Views\\", in which a photograph captured during \\"Occupy Airport\\" and a young man being pinned down by police in a protest were featured. = 9 July = Australia suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty  Australia suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong (which has been in place since 1993) and offered to extend visas by five years for Hong Kong residents currently in the country, and opening a pathway to permanent residency for up to 10,000 people working and studying in Australia. The government has also warned the more than 100,000 Australians in Hong Kong that they \\"may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds. You could break the law without intending to. If you're concerned about the new law, reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong\\". = 10 July = Police raid Pan- democratic primaries polling office  Police raided the offices of the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (PORI), a polling firm that was working with the pan-democracy camp, the night before the pan-democracy camp's primaries for the upcoming legislative election.Lung, Natalie; Marlow, Iain. \\"Hong Kong Police Raid Pollster Working With Democracy Movement \\", BloombergQuint. July 10, 2020. Retrieved July 11, 2020. According to Hong Kong Free Press, police accused the organization for \\"dishonest use of computers\\", claiming that someone named \\"Tony Mike\\" told pro-Beijing state-run newspaper Wen Wei Po on Thursday that PORI does not erase interviewees' personal data collected from past surveys, claiming that the data had been hacked and leaked. Although with a court warrant, the organizer and a team of PORI lawyers refused the police's request to hand over all the computer units. As a result, police stayed at the premise for several hours, going through each computer unit and writing down notes for further investigation. Police also gave an oral promise that the taken data will not be used for other investigations (such as those protest-related). No equipment was taken, and no arrests were made. Due to this incident, the primaries originally scheduled to begin at 9am the next day have been postponed till 12 noon. = 11 July = Day one of two first Pan-democratic primaries  With the original 2-day total estimated voter turnout being 170,000, over 220,000 Hong Kongers cast their ballots on the first day at over 250 polling stations throughout Hong Kong in hope to unseat the pro-Beijing establishment party, the DAB, in the Legislative Council election in September.  Anti-national security law protest march in Paris, France  Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters took to the street in Paris to voice their opposition against the imposition of the national security law in Hong Kong. The protest was organized by AfricaHongKongFrance (AHKF), a newly formed alliance group of Hong Kongers and Africans living in France, Cerveaux non disponibles, a French media outlet, and Mouvement Yoallahsuuren led by Mimo Dia Leydimen. Participants included French senator Andr√© Gattolin, French supporters, Africans, Uyghurs, Taiwanese, East Turkestan Asians and Hong Kongers living or studying in France. In a promotional YouTube video published on its website, AHKF announced that this peaceful march was a \\"call upon all the Yellow Vests, sympathisers, to all the political refugees, exiled, the outraged, the weak and the mad people to pressure [French President] Emmanuel Macron and make him condemn firmly and immediately China [...]\\". Many participants were seen holding up blank sheets of paper as their \\"silent slogan\\". In his Facebook page, Mimo Dia Leydimen stressed the importance of solidarity with African brothers and sisters under the increasing totalitarian Chinese presence in Africa after launching its \\"Belt and Road\\" initiatives. The march began at Place de la Bastille and ended at Place de la Republique. The event ended peacefully with police presence throughout the march. = 12 July = Day two of primaries  In total, over 610,000 voters participated in the primaries, almost four times greater than the original estimate by the pollster organization. The high turnout should serve as \\"proxy referendum against the national security law\\", said a pro-democracy candidate Eddie Chu as reported by BBC.  Protest march in Tokyo, Japan  Hundreds of Taiwanese, Hong Kongers, Uyghurs, Mongolians, and Tibetans living in Japan took to the streets to voice their opposition against the Communist Chinese government. The organizer of this joint protest, Japan Uyghurs Association and Stand With Hong Kong @ JPN, denounced the increasing hostile intimidation and militant tactics of the Communist party to its neighboring regions and urged the Japanese government to scrap Xi Jinping's scheduled state visit. = 13 July = \\"Primaries may breach national security law\\"  Both the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong and Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam denounced the democratic primaries as a possible breach of the national security law. = 14 July = International response: US President signed Hong Kong Autonomy Act and executive order on Hong Kong Normalization  Passed unanimously first by the House of Representative on June 25 and on July 2 by the Senate, US President Donald Trump signed the Hong Kong Autonomy Act into law, ending Hong Kong's preferential treatment as an autonomous region. This bill has a 90-day window for the Secretary of State to impose sanctions on \\"a foreign person [who] is materially contributing to, has materially contributed to, or attempts to materially contribute to the failure of the Government of China to meet its obligations under the Joint Declaration or the Basic Law\\". Trump also signed into law an executive order detailing 14 actions to stop treating Hong Kong as a special and independent region. The normalization measures include that Hong Kong SAR passport holders will be treated the same as Chinese passport holders, scientific and technical cooperation between Chinese University Hong Kong and the United States Geological Survey ‚Äì which had previously expired ‚Äì will not be renewed, and Hong Kong police training in the United States will be ended. In a press conference, Trump stated that Hong Kong people's \\"freedoms have been taken away\\" when China enacted its national security law in Hong Kong, and that because of that, \\"Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China\\" by the United States.  VPN companies relocating Hong Kong servers  Virtual Private Networks, VPNs, allow users to create secured connections to another network over the Internet, protect one's browsing history and passwords, and shield users from other suspicious public WIFI activities. Two VPN providers, Tunnel Bear and Private Internet Access (PIA), have announced on the 13th and the 14th, respectively, that they will remove their physical servers from Hong Kong to protect their users' privacy in light of the uncertainty created by Beijing's national security law in Hong Kong. Both companies stressed that they do not store personal identifiable information, and that, more than ever, it is imperative to continue providing service to Hong Kong users. Other VPN providers, such SurfSharks, are watching the situation closely and expressed that they would immediately shut down VPN servers located in Hong Kong if they ever received \\"requirements from authorities to start logging user activity\\". = 15 July = New York Times to move Asia headquarters from Hong Kong to South Korea  The New York Times announced that it will move its Asia headquarters' digital team of journalists, approximately one third of its staff, from Hong Kong to Seoul, South Korea, in response to the uncertainty created by the national security law. The Times said that securing work permits for its workers has become increasing challenging recently, and while that was commonplace in China, it has never been an issue in Hong Kong. One such journalist is Chris Buckley, who has been working out of the Hong Kong office after Chinese authorities in May declined to renew his work visa and thus effectively expelled him from his 24-year stationing in China. Hong Kong, a special administrative region (SAR) that guarantees its people the freedom of press according to Basic Law article 27, has declined to approve Buckley‚Äôs work visa application to work in Hong Kong without giving a specific reason. The Times reiterated that it will continue to maintain a large presence in Hong Kong and has \\"every intention of maintaining our coverage of Hong Kong and China\\", but it feels the need to form contingency plans and diversify its geographical spread amid the new national security law reality.  International response: Czechia ready to withdraw from Hong Kong extradition agreement  Czechia (or Czech Republic) and Hong Kong established their extradition agreement in 2014. However, citing Article 38 of the newly enacted national security law, that the law \\"shall apply to offences...committed against the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from outside the Region by a person who is not a permanent resident of the Region\\", Czech is now mulling to terminate the agreement. \\"The question of the possibility of abusing extradition for the political prosecution of persons who have expressed their dissenting position in the Czech Republic is something for which we should consider whether to withdraw from this extradition agreement\\", according to Minister Pet≈ô√≠ƒçek. He further stressed that China's signal to step above Hong Kong will not \\"go unanswered\\".  Protest-related journalism award  South China Morning Post journalist Dayu Zhang won this year's Lorenzo Natali Media Grand Prize with his work titled \\"The 'thin yellow line' standing between Hong Kong police and protestors\\". The 8-minute long video captured moments of a community group of elderly seeking to defuse tensions between protestors and police in the summer of the pro- democracy protests in 2019. The Lorenzo Natali Media Prize was launched in 1992 to recognize and celebrate excellence in reporting on sustainable development issues. It was named after Lorenzo Natali, a precursor of European development policy. Today, the Lorenzo Natali Media Prize help create a platform supporting journalism for sustainable development. The Prize also \\"gives a voice to those whose vital message is often overlooked or ignored.\\" = 16 July = Taiwan officials left Hong Kong, refused to sign \\"One China\\" declaration in work visa renewal  The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Hong Kong (TECO) serves as an unofficial embassy for Taiwanese living in or working in Hong Kong. In light of the recent enactment of the national security law, the Hong Kong government has asked multiple Taiwan officials to sign a 4-point declaration before their work visa can be granted. However, at least three of five top TECO officials have refused to sign such document and thus returned to Taiwan due to expired work visa. Point 1 of the document, as reported by Up Media, stated that TECO must promise to \\"acknowledge the 'One China' policy, the Hong Kong Basic Law, and all Hong Kong laws, and TECO must not interfere with Hong Kong's internal affairs, must not hurt Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and must not embarrass the Hong Kong government.\\" While the relationship between Taiwan and China has always been precarious, there was a period of time when such endorsement-type document was not required between 2008-2016, during the presidency of KMT politician Ma Ying-jeou. Despite not having enough top officials on site in Hong Kong, TECO stated that their service remains intact and committed to both Taiwanese in Hong Kong and Hong Kongers seeking Taiwan support. = 17 July = UK judge statement on Hong Kong Final Court of Appeal  The President of the UK Supreme Court, The Right Hon Lord Reed of Allermuir, issued a statement titled \\"Role of UK judges on the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal\\". The statement began with a summarized history of Hong Kong and UK's pre- and post-1997 judiciary agreements. Then the statement listed two current concerns that the court has, one concern being the vacant Final Appeal court judge position and the second being the challenge of upholding of Hong Kong judicial independence with the new national security law. Since 1997, Hong Kong and UK agreed that the House of Lords would provide two serving Law Lords to sit on the newly created Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, and Article 82 of Basic Law requires that judges could be invited \\"from other common law jurisdictions to sit on the Court of Final Appeal\\". \\"Other common law jurisdictions\\" refers to Australia or Canada, according to the statement. However, since the retirement of one of the two Final Court of Appeal judges earlier this year Hong Kong has not yet filled this vacancy, and no one has been scheduled to take the seat until the end of the year, creating a judicial vacuum. The second concern is the potential erosion of judicial independence by the national security law. Article 85 of Basic Law states that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \\"shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference. Members of the judiciary shall be immune from legal action in the performance of their judicial functions.\\" Lord Reed concluded his statement casting doubt whether \\"judges of the Supreme Court can continue to serve as judges in Hong Kong will depend on whether such service remains compatible with judicial independence and the rule of law.\\"  Deutsche Bank moves its Asia-Pacific headquarters to Singapore  Deutsche Bank announced that it is moving its Asia-Pacific region headquarters from Hong Kong to Singapore. = 18 July = National security law: China removed mobile music game Cytus II over its music director‚Äôs personal coded ‚Äúseparatist‚Äù song  The song, titled ‚ÄúTelegraph 1344 7609 2575‚Äù, has been posted by Wilson ‚ÄúIce‚Äù Lam since March on his personal SoundCloud account. Chinese internet users discovered and figured out that the secret Morse code translates to \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times\\" in Chinese, an alleged banned slogan under the new national security law. Although SoundCloud, same as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, is illegal in China due to the country's firewall, and while punishment to those illegal Internet users is largely unknown, China decided to remove the game Cytus II, of which Lam is the music director. Lam, in response, resigned immediately from the game company Rayark Games, claimed sole responsibility of the song and stood by his political beliefs. = 19 July = More uncertainty and confusion in the financial industry amid national security law  Two days after Deutsche Bank' s decision to leave Hong Kong, Reuters reported that at least four global banks are now scrutinizing their clients for their anti-government ties, coincidentally on the same day where two government organizations issued statements reassuring financial stability amid national security law. Whereas the main role of the Hong Kong Financial Secretary is to assist the Chief Executive in overseeing financial and economic policies, Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is an independent statutory body set up in 1989 to regulate Hong Kong's securities and futures markets. HK Financial Secretary Paul Chan penned a letter to HKSFC Chief Executive Officer Ashley Alder on July 17, stating that the national security law is \\"NOT intended to affect the way they conduct business, engage in market activities or allocate their capital.\\" Two days later Alder affirmed that the many practices and activities shall remain unaltered and that \\"all related regulations will be administered by the SFC in the same manner as before the advent of the NSL.\\" Contrary to what these two government organizations claimed, Reuters on the same day reported that bankers at Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.S), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), Julius Baer Gruppe AG (BAER.S) and UBS Group AG (UBSG.S) are now vetting their clients‚Äô public and private social media dating as far back as 2014 during the Umbrella Movement to check for their pro-democracy stance. According to Reuters, at least three wealth managers in Hong Kong say they are worried about the regulatory and reputation risks to their banks if charges are made against their pro-democracy clients. A top executive at a regional wealth manager also said that his firm‚Äôs risk and compliance team prepared a list of top 10 Hong Kong individuals identified in local media as pro- democracy sympathisers within a couple of days of the enactment of the law on July 1. It is worth noting that even before the enactment of the national security law, in November 2019, pro-Beijing HSBC had already terminated Spark Alliance HK's protest relief fund account, citing \\"money laundering\\" concerns in an effort to cut ties with pro-democracy protest organizations.  Yuen Long 721 anniversary march  Grassroot anti-government/pro-independence organization TSWConnection (Tin Shui Wai) marched within Yuen Long in protest of last year‚Äôs Yuen Long Attack, the prolonged delay of police response at the time, and the lack of prosecution of these attackers after one year. A bigger, district-wide march request was submitted earlier but police had declined to issue \\"letter of no objection\\", citing pandemic concerns. As a result, the four TSWConnection founding members marched on their own around Yuen Long. 15 minutes into the march police began stop-and-search and pepper sprayed reporters and nearby onlookers in the midst of chaos. The 4-person group continued through various parts of Yuen Long where numerous citizens joined chanting and holding signs such as \\"corrupted cops\\", \\"police brutality\\" and \\"justice not served\\". The purple police warning sign \\"you may be breaching the national security law now\\" was held up by police twice in an attempt to disperse the crowd. After about 8 hours, 17 people were ticketed, 7 of which were district councilors, for violating \\"social distance ordinance 599G\\". Even though Public Order Ordinance 245 clearly states that \\"public meetings attended by not more than 50 persons, public meetings conducted in private premises attended by no more than 500 persons or public processions attended by not more than 30 persons do not require notification\\", police arrested the four TSWConnection members for \\"unlawful assembly\\". = 20 July = International response: United Kingdom suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty and extends China weapon embargo to Hong Kong  Due to \\"China's failure to live up to [its] international obligations with respect to Hong Kong\\", United Kingdom has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, immediately and indefinitely, and extended its arms embargo - which has been in place with China since 1989 - to Hong Kong. It also confirmed plans for a path to UK citizenship for around three million Hong Kongers. In his concluding remarks, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated that these responses are \\"reasonable and proportionate\\".  Prominent South Korea tech company Naver to move out of Hong Kong  To avoid China gaining access to its user information under the national security law, Naver is moving its data center from Hong Kong to Singapore. User information has been deleted since earlier this month and the Hong Kong servers were reformatted. China government has not requested information from Naver, and no user information has been leaked, according to Naver. = 21 July = Yuen Long 721 anniversary mall protest  In defiance of potential persecution under the national security law, hundreds of citizens gathered in Yuen Long‚Äôs YOHO mall and MTR exits to commemorate the one-year anniversary of the Yuen Long mob attack. In the attack, 45 train- riding commuters of all ages were beaten by white-shirt Yuen Long residents holding various sizes of sticks. Over 50 attackers have been identified by various channels such as RTHK and legislative council member Lam Cheuk-ting, who was also beaten by the mob last year, yet to this day only 7 of them were charged and none of those have been tried. On the 21st of each month after the attack MTR would purposely close off Yuen Long station, citing security risk. While the station remained largely open today many exits were closed. Whereas a year ago it allegedly took the police force 39 minutes to arrive at the crime scene after hundreds of 999 calls, today riot police in full gear came out in droves to enforce the social distance ordinance and disperse the crowd. Among those who protested were four individuals dressed in mob outfits, one of them carrying a watermelon, symbolizing the well-identified attacker Jacky Chan. Numerous people also held up blank pieces of paper, and many more chanted \\"no show on 721\\", implying the lack of police presence last year and the lack of investigation for a whole year. From around 5pm to midnight in YOHO mall and MTR area police stop-and-searched over 150 citizens, arrested 5 individuals for various charges and ticketed 96 people for breaking social distance ordinance (599G). There was several uses of pepper spray inside YOHO mall in addition to a point-blank close-range pepper-ball shooting at a man on the street, to which although the police denied hours after, the incident was captured by a car dashboard camera, refuting the denial. While Article 27 of Hong Kong Basic Law guarantees freedom of press, and 599G(4) exempt \\"Group gathering at a place of work for the purposes of work\\", at least 17 of the ticketed were journalists covering the story on site. Police later filed 6 complaints with Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) against various web media and their journalists for untruthful and biased reporting, but HKJA slammed back by accusing the police for obstructing freedom of press, for targeting volunteer and (not salaried) student journalists, and for fining and imposing fear on journalists working at the scene.  International response: US Secretary of State met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law  In a rather historic meeting with US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo in London, exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Nathan Law discussed the looming threat of the pro-Beijing government‚Äôs intervention in the upcoming September legislative election, for which over 600,000 Hong Kong citizens voted in the primaries two weeks ago. Law urged the world to keep an eye on this election as the government will use every excuse to disqualify candidates, delay the election, or suppress voter turnouts. There are two reasons that make this 20-minute meeting unique: first, the location of the meeting--the US ambassador‚Äôs residence Winfield House at Regent‚Äôs Park in London--traditionally only receives distinguished guests such as Queen Elizabeth and other royal family members. Law, as a 27-year-old exile, invited to hold meetings at Winfield House, with the US Secretary of State, is truly unusual. The second reason is the fact that both and former Hong Kong CEO CY Leung and current CEO Carrie Lam have not had the chance to meet with any US cabinet members. That the meeting with Law was arranged at the request of the State department, and that it took place right after Pompeo met with former HK governor Chris Patten, are evidence of Pompeo‚Äôs support of the Hong Kong pro- democracy movement against China.  International response: Taiwan denied Hong Kong officials work visas  The Hong Kong Economic, Trade, and Cultural Organization (HKETCO) serves as an unofficial Hong Kong representative office in Taiwan since December 2011 that strives to promote economic, trade and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, after Hong Kong government refused work visa to Taiwan TECO officials last week unless they sign a newly-imposed \\"One China\\" declaration, this week HKETCO confirmed that at least two of the 13 staff have had their work visa denied and have returned to Hong Kong.  ProtonVPN donates to Hong Kong pro-democracy relief fund  While many businesses are now rethinking their Hong Kong strategy amid national security law, Swiss-based ProtonVPN has been adamant about Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. ProtonVPN had issued a statement in May to support Hong Kong's digital freedom as national security law loomed. Today they announced their fundraising campaign to donate half of their July and August proceeds to support Hong Kong's pro-democracy organizations. In their declaration, Proton blamed Hong Kong's governing body effectively destroyed the idea of an autonomous, democratic Hong Kong by enacting a Beijing-backed security law, and as a result, \\"the Great Firewall of China can now be extended to Hong Kong, and protesters can now be arbitrarily detained and subject to criminal prosecution.\\" Proton cited a 3000% surge of traffic since July 6, the day the national security law's details were implemented. = 22 July = International response: United Kingdom's Hong Kong BNO path to UK citizenship details revealed  UK Home Secretary Priti Patel announced that starting January 1, 2021, Hong Kong citizens born before July 1, 1997 can apply for the British Nationals Overseas (BNO) passport and settle in the UK. Citizenship can be applied after staying for 5 years. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated that \\"the UK is keeping its word: we will not look the other way on Hong Kong, and we will not duck our historic responsibilities to its people.\\" = 23 July = Avast moves its VPN servers out of Hong Kong  Avast, a Czech-based online privacy company that offers Avast SecureLine VPN, AVG Secure VPN and HMA, will move their VPN servers from Hong Kong and their internet traffic will be rerouted via Taiwan and Singapore. The company will continue to monitor \\"for measures including the potential use of wiretaps and surveillance by the authorities\\" under the national security law, as it hopes to re-open for business in Hong Kong once the enforcement of the new law is fully evaluated. International response: US Secretary of State gave China policy statement addressing Hong Kong's crisis Amid heightened US-China diplomatic tensions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech at Nixon Library on China strategies of the United States for the near future. In the speech, Pompeo gave a brief history and international expectations of the diplomatic relations between US and China, whose foundations were laid in the era of president Nixon almost 50 years ago. Pompeo said that, instead of hope, there was now \\"repression in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang\\". He further highlighted how in the past several months \\"Hong Kongers [have been] clamoring to emigrate abroad as the CCP tightens its grip on that proud city\\", and how the world has watched \\"this [new] China walk away from their promises to the world on Hong Kong...\\". = 27 July = International response: Japan may send cross- party observers to Hong Kong legislative election  A group of Japanese lawmakers are considering going to Hong Kong in September to oversee Hong Kong's legislative election process, fearing China's newly enacted national security law will infringe on Hong Kong's electoral independence and fairness. Group member former Defense Minister Gen Nakatani stated that the legislative election should \\"reflect the will of the people and must be held in a fair manner so that it can be recognized by the international society\\". Politician Shiori Yamao along with other members are also proposing various ways to aid Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters from China's tightening grip by ways such as relaxing visa requirements and refusing to \\"assist investigations of those suspected of violating the security law\\". = 28 July =International response: New Zealand suspends Hong Kong extradition treaty  New Zealand suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and military and dual-use goods and technology exports from New Zealand to Hong Kong will now be treated in the same way as New Zealand treats such exports to China.  Pro- democracy tenured law professor fired by HKU  According to American Association of University Professors (AAUP), the idea of tenure is necessary in higher education. When there is a system in place to safeguard academic freedom, faculty members do not have to worry about losing their positions because of \\"their speech, publications, or research findings\\", and thus they can properly \\"fulfill their core responsibilities to advance and transmit knowledge\\". Societies also do not benefit when \\"teachers and researchers are controlled by corporations, religious groups, special interest groups, or the government.\\" Benny Tai, a tenured associate law professor at Hong Kong University, was convicted of public nuisance for his lead in the 2014 Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy umbrella movement. He is currently on bail appealing that decision. In the meantime, Tai also successfully organized Hong Kong's first ever pro-democratic legislative council election primaries in July with over 610,000 Hong Kong residents participating. The pro-government HKU Council voted 18-2 to fire Tai, thereby overturning a previous recommendation by the HKU Senate. Tai‚Äôs lawyer expressed his discontent with the \\"disappointing political decision of the Council\\" and Tai stated in his Facebook page that he will appeal the decision and fight to protect academic freedom in Hong Kong University.  China oversteps into Hong Kong judiciary independence  Hong Kong's Department of Justice homepage states that under \\"the principle of 'One Country, Two Systems' which is enshrined in the Basic Law, Hong Kong enjoys independent judicial power including the power of final adjudication. It remains a common law jurisdiction within China.\\" Article 85 of Hong Kong Basic Law states that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \\"shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference,\\" and Article 82 of Basic Law requires that judges could be invited \\"from other common law jurisdictions\\" such as Australia, Canada, and the UK, to sit on the Court of Final Appeal. However, in today's press conference in Beijing, a mere 10 days after the UK Supreme Court president penned a statement expressing concerns over Hong Kong's judiciary independence after enacting the national security law, China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin declared that China ‚Äì not Hong Kong ‚Äì has decided that \\"the Hong Kong SAR will suspend its agreements on surrendering fugitive offenders with Canada, Australia and the UK.\\" In addition to ending Hong Kong's extradition agreements, China ‚Äì not Hong Kong ‚Äì has decided that the Hong Kong SAR \\"will suspend its agreements on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters with Canada, Australia and the UK.\\" = 29 July = National security law: four student ex-members of a now-disbanded pro- democracy group arrested  The group, Studentlocalism, announced on June 30 late night that it had disbanded its Hong Kong division and launched it overseas, right before the national security law took effect on July 1st. At around 9pm police arrested four ex-members, aged 16 to 21 years, for allegedly participating in and inciting secession, reportedly based on the group's overseas branch essay on July 25th titled \\"Confronting Chinese Nationalism and Constructing Hong Kong Nationalism\\". Whereas Hong Kong Basic Law Article 27 guarantees Hong Kong citizens' freedom of speech, the national security law article 38 grants Hong Kong police and officers sweeping, albeit controversial, powers to investigate and arrest anyone ‚Äì overseas and local alike ‚Äì who expresses different opinions. = 30 July = International response: EU response package  EU concluded its month-long meeting on the Hong Kong agenda on July 28, during which the Council expressed grave concerns regarding the Hong Kong national security law and set out five major action steps to be taken in the future to help Hong Kong defend its autonomy. Today EU published the detailed version. Some of the recommendations include suspending sensitive technologies and equipment sales, such as those used for civil suppression or cyber surveillance, to Hong Kong, increasing academic exchange with and scholarships to pro-democracy HK university programs, suspending new negotiations with Hong Kong, and closely monitoring pro- democracy activists' trials. = 31 July = Hong Kong disqualifies Opposition candidates Hong Kong authorities have disqualified 12 pro- democracy candidates from upcoming Legislative Council elections.  Hong Kong postpones legislative council election by a year  Hong Kong has postponed the Legislative Council elections that had been scheduled for September by a year, citing public health concerns in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. In response the UK issued a statement urging Hong Kong and China to not use COVID-19 \\"as a pretext to further undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong.\\" The United States also condemned the postponement, stating that \\"this action undermines the democratic processes and freedoms that have underpinned Hong Kong's prosperity.\\" While Lam had used emergency powers to postpone the election, she said that these would not allow her to handle questions surrounding the four-year term limit stipulated in Article 69 of the Hong Kong Basic Law. On Lam's request to mainland authorities, on 11 August an unanimous decision to support an extension of incumbency was issued by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of mainland China.  Six pro- democracy Hong Kong overseas activists wanted  Hong Kong police has issued six arrest warrants to Hongkongers for allegedly \\"inciting secession and collusion with foreign forces. The six activists are Nathan Law (currently in England seeking asylum), Wayne Chan Ka-kui (currently in Amsterdam), Honcques Laus (currently in England seeking asylum), Samuel Chu (a US citizen), Simon Cheng (currently in England seeking asylum after being detained and allegedly tortured by China earlier), and Ray Wong (who had been granted asylum in Germany in 2018).  Germany suspends extradition treaty with Hong Kong over rights infringement  Germany suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to Hong Kong government‚Äôs disqualifying 12 opposition candidates, its legislative election postponement, and China's arrest warrants of Hong Kong overseas exiles using the controversial national security law.

History At the outbreak of World War II the population of Frysztak was three quarters Jewish with 1,322 people. Major forms of commerce in Frysztak at this time included crafts and farming. The German occupation of the town began on September 8th, 1939 when German soldiers robbed Jewish homes and shops and forcibly conscripted Jews. One week after the occupation of Frysztak began, on Rosh Hashanah, German soldiers set fire to several holy objects and murdered Jewish worshipers in the synagogue. By November 1939, the Germans had incorporated Frysztak into the Generalgouvernment by merging the town with Kreis (sub-district) Jaslo, which was located within Krak√≥w District. From 1940 to 1943, SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Dr. Wilhem Raschwitz coordinated the anti- Jewish actions that were in Kreis Jaslo. Under Raschwitz authority was the Grenzpolizeikommissariat (GPK) who were in charge of a unit of German Gendarmerie stationed within Frysztak. The German Gendarmerie were in charge of the Polish police. In 1939, the Germans created a Judenrat consisting of Jewish elders, which they placed under the regional Judenrat of Kreis Jaslo on April 29th, 1940. The Frysztak Judenrat was in charge of its own unit of Jewish police and charged with recruiting Jews between the ages of 15 and 60 for forced labor. In 1940, the Fyrsztak Judenrat was also tasked with the management of refugees from Lodz, Slask, Krak√≥w and surrounding villages. Lastly, it was responsible for distributing food. Deteriorating conditions caused the Judenrat to call upon the Jewish Social Self-Help (JSS) organization to support Frysztaks people who were dangerously close to starvation in 1940. At this time, 283 Jews received material aid while 1,440 received financial assistance. On June 7th, 1941 the JSS set up a branch in Frysztak to not only help Frysztak Jews but extend their support to Jewish communities in Wisniowa and Odrzykon. Ultimately the JSS were only able to provide aid for 325 of the 400 Frysztak Jews that had applied. Although there was a labor camp located within Frysztak, its population of 2000 were primarily deported from Warsaw. Rather than keep them nearby, the Germans sent Frysztak Jews to four labor camps that surrounded the town. Housed within two synagogues, Jews in the Frysztak camp were forced to do road construction, build a railroad from the village of Wisnica to Stepina, and work on stone quarries located near Czeiswinia. They would sometimes have to walk up to 10 kilometers within a day to reach their job site. A Jewish internal police unit watched over the Frysztak camp, which operated from July 1941 until November of the same year when poor living conditions lead to the typhus outbreak which caused it to close. Germans sent the surviving Jews back to the Warsaw area. Before Germans established the Frysztak ghetto in January 1942, Jews were prohibited from leaving due to fear of spreading disease. This law persisted and became more severe with the Germans threatening death as a consequence for leaving. The ghetto continued to receive refugees from surrounding villages until Germans liquidated the ghetto. Since Jews were unable to leave Frysztak, JSS established a food kitchen, which provided 300 dinners a day, in an attempt to relieve some of the demand for food. Despite their efforts many still went hungry. Other ways in which the JSS attempted to aid Frysztak Jews was to reestablish the town as clothing production center to prevent deportation but unfortunately deportation proceeded when the Kreishauptmann shut done JSS plans for an agricultural training. The first round of deportation consisted of 800 Jews, including men over the age of 52 and women with more than two children, came after Jews were told to meet in the market by the Frysztak Judenrat. The fate of the first Jews to be deported from Frysztak was that of mass murder in the Warzyce Forest. The Germans shot the 800 people into three graves. Those who had not been killed right away were buried alive. The ghetto was liquidated on August 18 the same year, with the remaining Jews taken to Jas≈Ço ghetto.

Domestic Federal = Donald Trump  On May 27, 2020, U.S. president Donald Trump tweeted \\"At my request, the FBI and the Department of Justice are already well into an investigation as to the very sad and tragic death in Minnesota of George Floyd....\\" On May 29, Trump responded to the riots by threatening to send in the National Guard, adding that \\"Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\\" The tweet was interpreted as quoting former Miami Police Chief Walter Headley, who said \\"when the looting starts, the shooting starts\\" in December 1967, as Miami saw escalating tensions and racial protests aimed at the 1968 Republican National Convention. Trump's use of the quote was seen by Twitter as an incitement of violence; Twitter placed the tweet behind a public interest notice for breaching its terms of service in regards to incitement of violence. The next day, Trump commented on his original tweet, saying, \\"Looting leads to shooting, and that's why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night ‚Äì or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don't want this to happen, and that's what the expression put out last night means....\\" In a series of tweets on May 31, Trump blamed the press for fomenting the protests and said journalists are \\"truly bad people with a sick agenda.\\" On June 1, in a teleconference with state governors, Trump said they had been \\"weak\\" in their response to the unrest and insisted that they \\"have to dominate ... You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again.\\" He later proclaimed in the White House Rose Garden, \\"I am your president of law and order\\" and said he was \\"dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel, and law enforcement officers\\" to deal with rioting in Washington, D.C. Trump and an entourage subsequently departed the White House and walked to St. John's Episcopal Church, whose basement had been damaged by fire, and posed for pictures in front of it holding up a Bible. Police and federal agents had used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear a crowd of peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square to clear a route for Trump, an event that drew widespread condemnation from military and religious leaders, as well as fellow Republicans. Four days after this event Washington D.C. renamed the street corner in front of St. John's Church \\"Black Lives Matter Plaza\\" and painted \\"BLACK LIVES MATTER\\" in large, yellow letters stretching from Lafayette Square north for two blocks.Dwyer, Colin. 'Black Lives Matter Plaza,' Across From White House, Is Christened By D.C. Leaders. NPR. June 5, 2020. Retrieved June 6, 2020. U.S. Congress Republican Senators Ben Sasse (NB), Susan Collins (ME), Tim Scott (SC), and Lisa Murkowski (AK); Congressional Democrats, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi (CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (NY) criticized Trump's handling of the protests. Many other Congressional Republicans either defended the Trump administration's actions or avoided directly responding to questions about the forced clearance of Lafayette Square. In response to the protests, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) argued that extremists from the far-left and the far-right wanted to take aim at civil society and could potentially start a Second American Civil War. On June 7, 2020, Senator Mitt Romney (R-UT) participated alongside Black Lives Matter protesters in a march in Washington D.C. as the first Republican Senator to participate in the protests.  Other officials  Surgeon General Jerome Adams said, in relation to the protests, \\"I remain concerned about the public health consequences both of individual and institutional racism\\". Several military officials associated with various presidential administrations‚Äîincluding three former Trump appointees, ex-Secretary of Defense and retired Marine Corps general Jim Mattis, former White House Chief of Staff and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly, and former Assistant Secretary of Defense Mick Mulroy‚Äîcriticized Trump's response to the unrest. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden compared the death of George Floyd to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, saying that even \\"Dr. King's assassination did not have the worldwide impact that George Floyd's death did.\\" =States= Anti-police graffiti at the Utah State Capitol on May 30 On May 30, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that the riots have exposed the \\"inequality and discrimination in the criminal justice system\\" and that \\"When you have one episode, two episodes maybe you can look at them as individual episodes. But when you have 10 episodes, 15 episodes, you are blind or in denial if you are still treating each one like a unique situation\\". Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms called for protesters to express their anger through \\"non-violent\\" means. She decried the riots as illegitimate and accused them of harming Atlanta rather than helping. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Des Moines Mayor Frank Cownie, while sympathizing with the anger of protesters, asked for citizens to stop the violence and have a \\"Respectful, peaceful dialogue\\". After two people were charged with a hate crime for vandalizing a Black Lives Matter mural in Martinez, California, Contra Costa County District Attorney Diana Becton said the BLM movement \\"is an important civil rights cause that deserves all of our attention.\\" =General public= An early June Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll indicated the majority (64%) of American adults are \\"sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now\\" and a slight majority (55%) disapprove of Trump's handling of the protests. An Emerson poll of registered voters conducted between June 2‚Äì3 indicated that among American voters, 46% approve of the protests, 38% disapprove and 16% were neutral; 76% of voters disapprove of looting and property destruction during the protests, while 17% approve. =Industry= Various companies have made public statements against racism and injustice and showed other displays of support since the death of George Floyd. In response to complaints on social media reflecting similar complaints mentioned in a racial discrimination lawsuit, Walmart announced it would no longer store hair care products appropriate for most African Americans in locked security cases-products for other types of hair were not similarly locked away-in the few stores that had done so. On June 4, the CEO of LinkedIn apologized after a company meeting to address the George Floyd protests saw some employees make racially insensitive comments. Media industry The entertainment industry has been overwhelmingly supportive of the protests, exhibited by corporations voicing support for Black Lives Matter causes and a number of celebrities attending protests and making donations.

Billboard. Halsey,, J. Cole and Joe Jonas attended protests or otherwise voiced support for the cause. Jay-Z spoke to the Governor of Minnesota to weigh in on justice for George Floyd while Drake\\"Drake, The Weeknd, Kehlani, & Other Celebs Have Donated Large Sums Of Money To Support Black Lives Matter Movement\\". CapitalFM. and The Weeknd donated to pro-Black Lives Matter causes. Taylor Swift made headlines by denouncing President Trump on Twitter for \\"stoking the fires of racism.\\" The tweet went on to become the 15th most liked tweet of all time, garnering 2.2 million likes as of June 2020. K-pop group BTS, with the support of their agency BigHit Entertainment, donated $1,000,000 to the BLM movement. Following this announcement, fans of the group ran a #MatchAMillion campaign, which raised an additional $1,026,531 within a day to be split between various BLM-related organizations. Additionally, Kanye West donated $2,000,000 to the families of George Floyd, set up a 529 college fund for George Floyd's daughter as well as, fund Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery attorney fees. He was also seen protesting along with other protesters in Chicago. Television networks owned by ViacomCBS, including BET, CBS Sports Network, CMT, Comedy Central, Logo TV, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, Pop TV, the Smithsonian Channel, TV Land, and VH1 suspended regular programming for 8 minutes and 46 seconds on June 1 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time as a tribute to George Floyd. The networks aired a video with the caption \\"I can't breathe\\" accompanied with breathing sounds, while Nickelodeon aired a separate scrolling video containing language from the Declaration of Kids' Rights, which the network first created on June 7, 1990. On June 2, Discovery, Inc. displayed blackout screens as part of \\"Blackout Tuesday\\" for the same length of time on its 19 domestic channels in the U.S. On June 9 and 10, the same channels suspended programming for an hour each day at 9 p.m. Eastern time to broadcast a virtual roundtable discussion with African-American politicians, commentators, and entertainers. The show, moderated by Oprah Winfrey, was called OWN Spotlight: Where Do We Go From Here? Procter and Gamble was a presenting sponsor, and Essence magazine also bought air time to promote a contest for black female entrepreneurs. Netflix was the first major studio to issue a statement supporting Black Lives Matter in the wake of protests. YouTube pledged $1,000,000 to combat social injustice.

Stephanie Beatriz, who plays Rosa Diaz on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, made a personal donation to the fund while encouraging actors who portray police on television to do so as well. Meanwhile, Amazon Studios issued a statement supporting Black Lives Matter. Amazon Prime Video started displaying African-American themed selections in a prominent Black Lives Matter category. Many members of the video game industry supported the protests and Black Lives Matter. Electronic Arts, 2K Games and Humble Bundle committed towards black-oriented charities and foundations. Ubisoft, Square Enix, and The Pokemon Company also made significant financial commitments to the cause. Sports industry Much of the sports industry has been supportive of the protesters demanding justice for George Floyd. Several footballers across different leagues including Jadon Sancho, Romelu Lukaku, Marcus Rashford, among other, have shown full solidarity towards the issue. In June 2020, Raheem Sterling on the BBC programme Newsnight, reacting to anti- racism protests around the world said that this is the time to speak up against injustice, especially in football. The forward remarked that there are 500 players in the Premier League of which one-third constitute of blacks, but the hierarchy has no black representative for blacks in the management. \\"It's not just taking the knee, it is about giving people the chance they deserve,\\" he lamented on Floyd's death and lack of acceptance for black worldwide. On June 17, 2020, more than 3 months after the Premier League resumed, Aston Villa and Sheffield United players took a knee in support of the BLM movement before the match. Six-time Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, who is the sport's first and only black driver has criticized the industry for the silence over the matter on Instagram. This has led to his fellow drivers expressing their views with several others supporting the campaign. Formula One also issued a statement echoing Hamilton's post. Hamilton has also launched a commission to improve diversity in racing, with Formula One launching an initiative known as \\"We Race As One\\" to tackle racial injustice. Former Formula One Group chairman Bernie Ecclestone caused controversy when he questioned Hamilton's initiative and adding that \\"Black people are more racist than what White people are\\". This has caused Hamilton to hit back at Ecclestone, calling Ecclestone as \\"ignorant and uneducated\\", with Formula One issuing a statement saying that they \\"completely disagree with Bernie Ecclestone‚Äôs comments that have no place in Formula 1 or society\\". NASCAR has banned Confederate flags at all of their events, following a call by driver Bubba Wallace for a ban of the flags. An incident occurred during the GEICO 500 weekend, when a noose was discovered in Wallace's garage at the Talladega Superspeedway. Following an investigation, the FBI concluded that Wallace was not a victim of hate crime, but the noose had been there since October 2019. CrossFit CEO Greg Glassman was forced to resign over his response to the killing; over a thousand gyms, top CrossFit athletes, and Reebok and Rogue Fitness dropped partnerships with the company. In June 2020, The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) showed staunch support towards the black lives matter movement and acknowledged that cricket is also not immune to systematic racism. However, the board affirmed that it will address the issue and try to bring ‚Äúmeaningful and long-term change‚Äù to the game. ‚ÄúWe will now work to engage community leaders and black influencers within cricket so that we can review and evolve our existing inclusion and diversity work and specifically address the issues raised by the black community,‚Äù it added. In July 2020, Patty Mills said that he would play in the NBA restart and donate his entire salary for 2020 towards fighting racism. The NBA star revealed that the amount would precisely be $1,017,818.54 and said that it would be bifurcated and donated towards Black Lives Matter Australia among other racism related concerns. = Philanthropy = George Soros' Open Society Foundations announced it would make US$150 million in grants for Black-led racial justice groups, and US$70 million in local grants for criminal justice reform and civic engagement opportunities. Its president said the foundations saw this as a way to harness the momentum toward racial justice, a moment it has been \\"investing in for the last 25 years‚Äù. According to the New York Times, the initiative will \\"reshape the landscape of Black political and civil rights organizations\\", signaling the extent to which race and identity have become the explicit focal point of American politics in recent years, and position Soros' foundation \\"near the forefront of the protest movement\\". = Community organizations = Musician Jon Batiste in Brooklyn on Juneteenth 2020 Various community organizations have responded to the events with messages condemning racism. Organizations representing most religious organizations in the United States, including the National Council of Churches, numerous bishops representing various churches, 26 Jewish organizations, the Hindu American Foundation (HAF), the Sikh Coalition, the Buddhist Churches of America and others released statements condemning the killing of George Floyd and calling for racial justice. Multiple community organizations representing South Asians including the Association of Indian American Doctors and various branches of the Federation of Indian Associations have also issued statements about the incident. = Counter-protests = The protests have been met with resistance and attempts at disruption by some far-right groups. There have been various reports of Proud Boys and people with anti-federal government and/or white supremacist ideals such as the Boogaloo movement infiltrating protests as part of a larger strategy of causing a \\"race war\\", or a \\"second Civil War.\\" People associated with these movements have been charged in connection with terrorist plots, car attacks, and shootings that have taken place in conjunction with the protests.

It is the reaction to inequality and the treatment that a community receives, and is the black community in the United States that suffers every so often attitudes like the one we saw filmed\\" he replied, referring to George Floyd's video and making a further comment about it: \\"It is a demeaning action to the human condition: someone who leans on the neck of someone lying on the floor who is telling him that he suffocates, and still lets him suffocate,\\" he lamented; \\"We have to learn that an individual cannot live in peace with inequality, one cannot pretend to be distracted by inequality. We have to work to give better life quality and opportunities for all\\", concluded the head of state. * ‚Äì Prime Minister Scott Morrison stated his beliefs that violent protests would not create change. He warned against Australian demonstrations taking a similar course as \\"there's no need to import things happening in other countries.\\" * ‚Äì President Jair Bolsonaro expressed \\"regret\\" over the killing of Floyd, but attempted to distance ongoing protests in Brazil from their U.S. counterparts, stating that \\"racism [in the United States] is a little different from Brazil\\". He also shared a post by President Trump regarding the U.S. designating Antifa as a terrorist organization. * - Prime Minister Hun Sen was quoted saying \\"Where are Brad Adams and Human Rights Watch? Where are they now? Why haven‚Äôt we heard its cries for human rights?\\". * ‚Äì Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called for Canada to \\"stand together in solidarity\\" against racial discrimination. He said Canadians are watching the police violence in the United States in \\"shock and horror.\\" When Trudeau was asked about Trump's threats to use military force against protesters, he paused for 25 seconds before responding diplomatically. * ‚Äì The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that \\"Black Lives Matter and their human rights should be protected,\\" adding that they hoped that the U.S. government \\"would take all necessary measures to deal with the violent law enforcement of police, so as to protect and safeguard the legitimate interests of racial minorities.\\" However, both state media and individual officials also criticized the United States government and accused it of hypocrisy. For instance, the Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the United States of having a 'double standard' for labeling U.S. protesters disappointed with racism as rioters while glorifying the Hong Kong protesters as heroes, and for shooting U.S. protesters and mobilizing the National Guard while criticizing the Hong Kong police.

E. B. Stuart Monument is a partially deconstructed monument to Confederate general J. E. B. Stuart at the head of historic Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, which was dedicated in 1907. Currently an empty granite pedestal, the equestrian statue of General Stuart was removed from its pedestal and placed into storage on July 7, 2020 after having stood there for 113 years. The removal was in response to nationally reported events of police brutality and a corresponding emergency declaration in Virginia. Description The J. E. B. Stuart Monument, a remaining granite pedestal which had displayed the bronze equestrian pose of General Stuart, is located in a traffic circle known as Stuart Circle, located at the termination of West Franklin Street and the cross street of North Lombardy at the head of Monument Avenue. History Southwest facing view of the Stuart monument and the First English Lutheran Church The statue, sculpted by Frederick Moynihan of New York, was the second monument unveiled on Monument Avenue, in 1907, and was inspired by the statue of British Lieutenant General Sir James Outram in Kolkata, India. Stuart is turned in the saddle facing east while the horse faces north. The horse had one hoof lifted which, though likely a stylistic choice by the artist has been believed by local legend and based on other statues of the period to denote that Stuart was wounded in his last battle. Two lifted hooves would indicate a death in the heat of battle. (Stuart survived his wound but died days later.) Plans for the Stuart statue were first discussed publicly as early as 1875; however the competition was not held until 1903. Fitzhugh Lee again chaired the selection committee, as he had for the Lee Monument. The site location was chosen in 1904. At the same time plans for the third monument, to Jefferson Davis, were being planned for further west at Monument Avenue and Cedar Street. The dual unveiling drew crowds even larger than for the Lee unveiling. Crowds were estimated between 80,000 and 200,000, including 18,000 veteran attendees who camped out for the week. =Removal= The defaced statue after the George Floyd protests Following the death of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, the Confederate memorials of Monument Avenue again came under scrutiny. After the amendment of the state law on the removal of Confederate war memorials, Governor Ralph Northam announced the imminent removal of the Robert E. Lee Monument, which is located on state land. On June 3, 2020, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney announced he would introduce an ordinance on July 1 to have the J. E. B. Stuart Monument removed in additional to three other Confederate monuments, all located on city land. The Stuart equestrian statue was removed from the remaining granite pedestal on July 7, 2020. The statue was then placed in storage with its location of subsequent display or other fate to be at a determined later date.https://www.richmond.com/news/local/update-j-e-b- stuart-statue-removed-from-richmonds-monument- avenue/article_3c13b683-bdd2-5aec-b3db-1de5a3d4507f.amp.html See also * List of monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests ReferencesExternal links * Category:1907 establishments in Virginia Category:1907 sculptures Category:Monument Avenue Category:Buildings and structures in Richmond, Virginia Category:Equestrian statues in Virginia Category:Monuments and memorials in Virginia Category:Monuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests Category:Outdoor sculptures in Richmond, Virginia Category:Removed Confederate States of America monuments and memorials Category:Sculptures of men in Virginia Category:Vandalized works of art in Virginia ","title":"J.

He is best known for his song \\"As I'll Ever Be\\", which was featured in the Netflix film To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You. His single \\"Not OK!\\" is currently #19 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay Chart.  Early life  Chaz Cardigan was born and raised in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. He's described his childhood as \\"pretty midwestern\\", adding that he was \\"awkward\\", \\"twitchy\\", and unpopular for being perceived as \\"abrasive\\" and \\"politically outspoken very young\\". Growing up in a rural area, he used creativity as a child to stave off boredom by making toy inventions using \\"duct tape and shoestring\\" and writing screenplays. His earliest musical memories were of his older sister playing piano and listening to late-90's pop music such as Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. > \\"I thought that *NSYNC and Backstreet Boys was what ‚Äúmusic‚Äù was, so I picked > up piano and guitar to be like Justin Timberlake.\\" He became obsessed with making music after first hearing Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúBohemian Rhapsody‚Äù. At age 11, he bought a TASCAM four-track tape recorder and began teaching himself to produce and record, while playing in local punk rock bands. He would upload early demos to Myspace and mail cassette tapes to record labels in hopes of attracting attention and signing a record deal. For most of his teen years, Cardigan commuted daily to Nashville to pursue his career as an artist while attending Elizabethtown High School. He was active in theater and his school's debate club. After graduating, he moved to Nashville to pursue music full-time rather than attend college. He has mentioned that he planned to study film in college. Cardigan came out as queer early in life. Regarding that, he said: ‚ÄúI came out around the time I was 13. Which in Kentucky is not exactly a popular move. There was a lot of tension with students and parents and teachers around it, and that was an awkwardness I had to learn to navigate really early. Thankfully I had music as a way to cope.‚Äù  Career  Cardigan made a living in Nashville working \\"every part- time job you can think of\\" and honing his production skills as a member of a hip hop collective called The Diatribe. In 2015 he was briefly homeless before moving in with members of a rock band called Safe Secrets and joining as a bass player for a short time. He released his first single under the moniker Spazz Cardigan in 2016 before releasing his debut LP I in 2017. He was invited to perform at a string of unofficial South by Southwest showcases in 2017 following the album's release. Cardigan became a fixture of Nashville's blossoming local pop songwriting scene. He self-released a series of singles throughout 2018 that continually were placed on Spotify's New Music Friday editorial playlist. Within an 8 month span these songs accumulated 1 million streams. A quick rise in streaming numbers and a series of sold-out hometown shows attracted the attention of several record labels. Around this time he was commissioned by Google to create a series of instrumental songs for the YouTube Audio Library. In 2019 he performed as an opener for Julia Michaels and Band Camino, as well as playing his first festival dates that summer at SunFest and Forecastle Festival. He signed with Capitol Records at the beginning of that same year, becoming the first artist signed jointly to Capitol and Loud Robot (a subsidiary of J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot production company). In early 2020 he released his major-label debut, Vulnerabilia. Like his previous album, Cardigan self-produced and played all the instruments on Vulnerabilia. The title was imagined during a silent retreat at a monastery. The EP was preceded by the single \\"Not OK!\\", which became Cardigan's first radio single, and charted as a Top 30 Alternative song. Cardigan also writes and releases a weekly web-series called Wild World, condensing history, science, and philosophy ideas into 60-second episodes.  Influences  Cardigan's music draws from a wide range of influences including Imogen Heap, David Bowie, The Beatles, Sufjan Stevens, Peter Gabriel, Kanye West, Third Eye Blind, Nirvana, Talking Heads, Gorillaz, Bj√∂rk, The 1975, Kevin Gates, Sun Ra, Stevie Wonder, and Prince.  Name  Chaz has stated that the name Spazz Cardigan was a reaction to being called \\"spaz\\" in childhood. > \\"It was a nickname that stuck around the family, and particularly around > school. A lot of people knew me as Spazz before they knew my actual name‚Ä¶ > I‚Äôd been sorting names for months, and it just popped into my head. I asked > my roommate at the time, ‚ÄòHave you heard of Spazz Cardigan?‚Äô He says, ‚Äòno, > who‚Äôs that? What‚Äôs he done?‚Äô And I knew ‚Äî that‚Äôs the one! It sounds like a > name.\\" After becoming aware that the name was considered derogatory in much of the world, he resorted instead to using his birth name.  Reception  In 2020 Billboard wrote that Cardigan was \\"known for his soulful, strong singing voice and genre-bending brand of music ‚Äì a mix of folk, R&B;, and modern pop\\", calling him a \\"certified 21st century pop artist, unafraid to mix sounds as he sees fit.\\" Alternative Addiction praised \\"vocal diversity\\" and his \\"ability to write a catchy song\\". The Nashville Scene noted that \\"he writes songs grounded in compassion and honesty, often grappling frankly with mental health\\". He's been publicly vocal about mental health, gun control, and LGBT equality. The Advocate called him \\"an alt-rocker for a new, angsty generation, making space for himself in a genre in which LGBTQ musicians aren‚Äôt often seen.\\"  Discography  EPs = * Vulnerabilia (2020) = Studio albums = * I (2017) = Singles = * \\"iDeologue\\" (2016) * \\"Episode\\" (2018) * \\"Medicine\\" (2018) * \\"Over\\" (2018) * \\"DOIDOIT\\" (2018) * \\"Not OK!\\" (2020) * \\"As I'll Ever Be (2020) * \\"S.O.S.\\" (2020) * \\"Everything's Wrong\\" (2020) References External links  * * Chaz Cardigan on AllMusic Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:People from Elizabethtown, Kentucky Category:People from Nashville, Tennessee Category:Capitol Records artists Category:Queer musicians Category:American alternative rock musicians Category:Musicians from Kentucky Category:Musicians from Tennessee ","title":"Chaz Cardigan"},{"id":"64166964","text":"The church with its tower before the pinnacles were restored.

It mainly affected southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey. It resulted in four fatalities and about 575,000 people were left without power in the area. Structures, trees and power lines were also damaged by the powerful winds.  Storm overview  A Mesoscale Convective System developed just south of Lake Erie in the early morning hours of the June 3. Damaging winds in excess of were sporadic in western and central Pennsylvania, but as the MCS moved into increasingly unstable air in the eastern part of the state before noon, wind damage became more numerous and widespread. The National Weather Service warned of an ‚Äúextremely dangerous situation‚Äù as the squall line moved over the Philadelphia metro area and into New Jersey. According to the National Weather Service, the squall line met the criteria of a derecho, a fast-moving line of violent storms that produces widespread damage along its path. About 250 reports of wind damage were associated with the storms, with the highest measured wind gust being 93 mph in Beach Haven, New Jersey. The Storm Prediction Center highlighted much of eastern Pennsylvania and the entire state of New Jersey in an enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms. Morning storms over the Great Lakes intensified as they encountered warm, humid air over the East Coast. The environment over southern Pennsylvania and New Jersey was characterized by MLCAPE on the order of 1000-1500 J/kg, in addition to 40-50 kt of bulk effective shear. As they charged from northwest to southeast, the storms were teeming with lightning, visible from weather satellites in space. The storms tracked farther southeast than expected, sparing much of northeastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey. Multiple small fires broke out after power lines fell. Trees toppled onto many roads, including some highways. Roads were blocked and roofs were destroyed as the hurricane-force winds were unleashed. Several videos of the storm can be found on You Tube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4-BK- pkZHc&t;=150s&ab;_channel=SPCCamden2002https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM9tdeZv0Vw&ab;_channel=FledWeatherAnother round of storms following the derecho triggered a tornado warning that encompassed Philadelphia, and Camden, New Jersey, until 7:45 p.m. EDT on Wednesday night by the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey.  Impact and aftermath  Downed tree branch and damaged power lines caused by the derecho in Hatboro, Pennsylvania There were four fatalities confirmed. Three of the deaths occurred in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania in separate incidents involving falling trees. Two people died in Lower Merion when trees fell on their vehicles, and a third victim was killed when a tree fell onto Philmont Country Club in Lower Moreland. A fourth death occurred in Delaware County, Pennsylvania when a fallen tree caused an electrical malfunction, which in turn caused a house fire. The four deaths constituted the highest death toll from a derecho event in the region since 1950. At the height of the outages, more than 575,000 customers lost power in the affected states. Just after 2 p.m. Wednesday, more than 360,000 customers without power in Pennsylvania, mostly in the southeast part of the state, and nearly 180,000 outages in New Jersey were reported. A second area of widespread outages and damage reports focused east of Philadelphia in southern New Jersey in Burlington and Ocean counties, where trees and power lines were down in numerous locations. An 83 mph gust at the Reading Regional Airport in Pennsylvania was reported. Pottstown, Pennsylvania, saw winds gust to 76 mph, while gusts exceeding 75 mph were reported in Malvern, Pennsylvania. Doppler radar also indicated winds of around 77 mph just 100 to 200 feet above the ground over Center City Philadelphia, with a number of high-rise buildings or skyscrapers probably seeing wind gusts up to 80 mph. Philadelphia International Airport recorded a gust to 61 mph, while Northeast Philadelphia Airport clocked a gust to 67 mph. A 93 mph wind gust was reported in Beach Haven, New Jersey. Brick, New Jersey reported a wind gust of 87 mph. The last derecho seen in this region was in 2012, originating in Iowa and moving across southern Pennsylvania to the coast with peak winds of 80 to 100 mph.

Description and history Maury Monument at 3100 block of Monument Ave. in Richmond Virginia Maury Memorial showing primary and sub-pedestals with globe and seated Maury The sculpture was designed by Frederick William Sievers and unveiled on November 11, 1929. The \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" monument of Matthew Fontaine Maury is located on Monument Avenue at Belmont Avenue. In 1915 the Matthew Fontaine Maury Association was founded with the purpose of erecting a monument to Maury though serious fundraising did not happen until after the end of the First World War. Eventually the United Daughters of the Confederacy joined in the fundraising, the State of Virginia and the City of Richmond each donated $1,000, and even President Wilson, a native Virginian, joined the Association. The committee selected Richmond sculptor Frederick William Sievers, the author of many Lost Cause memorials, to produce the work and he created the \\"most allegorical of Richmond's monuments.\\" The monument was unveiled as part of an Armistice Day celebration on November 11, 1929. It was partially deconstructed with the lower statue on July 2, 2020 amid an extended emergency declaration order by the Governor. The seated figure of Maury faced eastward, toward the Atlantic Ocean that the \\"Pathfinder of the Seas\\" charted. He holds in his left hand a pencil and compass and in his right hand a copy of his charts. Beside his left foot is his book, Physical Geography of the Sea, as well as a Bible, indicating the central role that faith played in Maury's life. A globe of the Earth mounted on the upper pedestal is tilted slightly on its axis behind his head. It represents both land and sea, and the woman standing calmly is a representation of Mother Nature between the land and sea. Around the base of the globe are depictions of people clinging to a sinking boat in bad weather representing the dangers of the sea with a woman in the center, and on the right (north) side of the globe there is a farmer, boy and a dog representing Maury's work promoting land weather service, which dates back further than 1853. The statue of Maury was removed on July 2, 2020, though the pedestal, sub-pedestal, and bronze globe portion of the monument remained. The globe was removed on July 9, 2020.

The line operates every 20-30 minutes at all times. Route Z8 trips are roughly 60 minutes long. Background Route Z8 operates daily between Greencastle Park & Ride Lot and Silver Spring station mostly along Castle Boulevard, Old Columbia Pike, and Colesville Road. The route provides service for Four Corners, White Oak, Fairland to an easy access to Metrorail stations. Route Z8 currently operates out of Montgomery division. History Route Z8 had prior incarnations as the Old Bladensburg Road Line and the Sligo Avenue Line. The lines were at first operated as streetcars under the Capital Traction Company. The lines would later be operated by buses in 1927 and 1940. Both lines were later merged into one, later operated until DC Transit in 1956 and then acquired by WMATA on February 4, 1973. However the Z8 was later replaced by Ride On. Route Z8 would later be reincarnated as the Colesville Road‚ÄìFairland Line which would operate between Silver Spring station and Burtonsville Crossing Park & Ride lot via White Oak, Greencastle Park & Ride Lot, Briggs Chaney Park & Ride Lot, and a few peak-hour trips to Verizon‚ÄìChesapeake Complex. =2004 Changes= After a series of proposals in 2004, route Z8 was shorten to operate between Silver Spring station and Greencastle Park & Ride Lot via Briggs Chaney Park & Ride Lot. Service to the Burtonsville Crossing Park & Ride Lot was replaced by a new route Z6 on September 26, 2004. The Z8 also replaced portions of the Z1, Z3, Z4, and Z5 which were all discontinued on the same day. =2015 Changes= When the Paul S. Sarbanes Transit Center at Silver Spring station opened, route Z8 was rerouted from its bus stop along Wayne Avenue to Bus Bay 114 at the transit center on the first level. =Proposed Elimination= In 2019, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route Z8 service as it will overlap the upcoming Ride On Flash BRT service along U.S. Route 29 that is slanted to open in 2020. Route Z6 will be extended to Greencastle Park & Ride Lot in order to replace portions of the Z8 while the Flash BRT will replace most Z8 service. Controversy Montgomery County expressed concerns over the proposed Z6 and Z8 changes. According to Council Vice President Tom Hucker, residents impact 65,000 residents of the Maryland county. Residents urged WMATA to not cut service as it will cause a lack of transportation towards the residents. At least 30 Montgomery County leaders called on WMATA not to cut Metrobus routes in the region, saying it will \\"disproportionately affect\\" students, seniors, and service workers with no other source of transportation. The letter's signatories include state senators Craig Zucker, Susan Lee, and Cheryl Kagan, Maryland State Delegates Marc Korman, Sara Love, and Julie Palakovich Carr and all nine members of the county council. In a letter to Metro Chairman Paul Smedberg, members of the Montgomery County Council and state delegation said they opposed the cuts, which are part of WMATA's proposed FY 2021 operating budget, and urged the agency to prioritize \\"maintaining frequent and reliable service.\\" They also quote; The Metrobus routes currently recommended for service reductions, including the Q, J, L and Z bus lines, provide transportation for many of our most transit-dependent residents,\\" the lawmakers wrote. \\"Service reductions will disproportionately affect students commuting to Montgomery College, seniors running daily errands and service workers accessing jobs. Roughly 65,000 Montgomery riders use Metrobus on a daily basis, and for many these bus routes are their only source of transportation. The 35 lawmakers ended the letter by saying cuts to Metrobus service for Montgomery County would counter their \\"regional goals of reducing traffic congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.\\" On April 2, 2020, the FY2021 budget was released and WMATA. In about 251 votes from customer feedback, 59% of votes were against the changes for Z6 with 18% of votes in favor with the remaining 33% uncertain. For route Z8, out of 286 votes from customer feedback, 70% of voters were against the changes while 13% were in favor of the changes with 17% uncertain.

It faced the Principality of Benevento and later the Duchy of Apulia to the south. It covered part of the modern regions of Marche and Abruzzo. Map of the March of Fermo in 1803 The relationship of the March of Fermo to earlier administrative divisions is uncertain. By the 12th century it had been merged with the March of Ancona. The name continued in use to describe the province around Fermo and in this way formed one of the marches that gave the region of Marche its name. Origins The March of Fermo may be a direct continuation of the Duchy of Fermo of the Lombard era. This was created by King Liutprand around 727 out of territory he conquered from the Byzantine Empire. The name of only one duke is recorded, Tasbun, named in an inscription of 769 or 770 at Falerone. The Duchy of Fermo was distinct from the duchies of Ancona and Osimo, probably also created by Liutprand. It survived the Frankish conquest of 774 and is mentioned in a diploma of Charlemagne dated 787. It is uncertain when it was downgraded to a march. A letter of Pope John VIII to the Emperor Charles the Fat dated 882, in which Duke Guy II of Spoleto and his son Guy III, are referred to as margraves (marchiones) for the first time, may indicate the shift. The March of Camerino, detached from the Duchy of Spoleto in the 9th century, may be identical to the March of Fermo first attested in the 10th. In the early 840s, the march(es) of Fermo and Camerino were devastated by Saracen raiders. The March of Fermo is first attested in a diploma of Emperor Otto II in 983. Writing in the 11th century, Hugh of Farfa and Gregory of Catino refer to the March of Fermo in connection with the reign of King Hugh of Italy (926‚Äì947) and the abbacy of Rimo of Farfa (920‚Äì930). The march included the four counties of Fermo, Camerino, Ascoli and Abruzzo. Papal involvement For his war against the Normans, Pope Leo IX recruited an army from the Holy Roman Empire. Men from the March of Fermo were in his army that was defeated at the Battle of Civitate on 18 June 1053. In 1055, the Emperor Henry III appointed Pope Victor II to the offices of margrave (or marquis) of Fermo and duke of Spoleto. In his capacity as margrave of Fermo, Victor held a placitum at Teramo. After the death of Victor in 1057, Godfrey the Bearded took control of the March of Fermo and the Duchy of Spoleto. He was already the margrave of Tuscany and his brother was elected Pope Stephen IX to succeed Victor, making him the preeminent power in Italy. In the March of Fermo, however, there was opposition to Godfrey's rule. In the first months of 1059, Pope Nicholas II visited the march in person to place the city of Ancona under interdict. Norman incursions The Abruzzo, the coastal region south of Fermo, was considered part of the March of Fermo. By the mid-1070s, the Normans were encroaching on this area. In an agreement reached between Pope Gregory VII and the Norman duke Robert Guiscard at Ceprano in June 1080, the pope refers to \\"the territory which you now hold unjustly, such as Salerno and Amalfi and part of the March of Fermo\\". These incursions were among the reasons Gregory gave for excommunicating Guiscard. Prince Jordan of Capua also led invasions into the March of Fermo. His conquests passed to Guiscard on his death. In 1075, King Henry IV of Germany demanded that Robert do him homage for his lands in Apulia, but the duke responded that he would only do homage for imperial lands. In May 1081, when Henry entered Italy with a small force, Gregory VII was informed that he intending to recruit more troops in the March of Fermo. It seems that he intended to marry his son Conrad to a daughter of Robert Guiscard and to enfeoff the latter with the march, which lay immediately north of Guiscard's duchy and the south of which Guiscard's Normans had already occupied. Nothing came of these plans and in July 1081 Henry IV enfeoffed Rainer II with the March of Fermo and Duchy of Spoleto. Marches of Ancona and Fermo in 1703 Merger into the March of Ancona Around 1100, a new formation appears in the records under Rainer's successor, Werner II: the March of Ancona, which was limited to the north of the March of Fermo and the southern Pentapolis. At first this new march took Werner's name as the marca Guarnerii or March of Werner. Werner was also Duke of Spoleto. Ekkehard of Aura describes him as \\"one of the king's ministeriales, who held the command of the march in the region of Ancona\\". On 3 May 1111, Pope Paschal II complained to the Emperor Henry V that the possessions of the Roman See in the March of Fermo‚Äîpresumably some of them in the hands of the Normans‚Äîhad not been restored. The March of Fermo was ultimately absorbed into Werner's March of Ancona.

J. G Schwart & S√∏n was from 1806 to 1983 based at the site. The entire complex was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. Harald Conrad Stilling's shop facade and interior from 1847 is part of the heritage listing. History18th century= The buildings at the site were destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. Two two-storey buildings with three-bay wall dormers, one at present day No. 3 and the other one at No. 1, were subsequently constructed at the site by master builder Gotfrid Schuster in 1730. The house at No. 3 (formerly No. 170) was heightened by two storeys in 1791. =1806-1983: The Schwartz family= Johan Adam Schwartz Sv√¶rtegade 3 was in 1806 acquired by turner Johan Adam Schwartz (1751-1835). He had become a partner in his old master S. I. Graumann's business back in 1801 and had after Graumann's death in 1704 married his widow and continued the workshop alone. The workshop was after Schwartz's death in 1835 handed down to his nephew Johan Georg Schwartz (1789-1864). The name J. G. Schwartz & S√∏n was adopted in 1847 when his son Johan Adam Schwartz (1820-1874) was made a partner. The architect Hans Conrad Stilling was that same year charged with installing a modern shop in the ground floor of the building in Sv√¶rtegade. Johan Adam Schwartz's widow Thora Louise Schwartz continued the operations after her husband's death until her own death the following year. The firm was then taken over by Frans Schwartz and H. E. Kllein. After Frans Swartz's death in 1917, it was converted into a limited company (aktieselskab. =Later history= In 1983, J. G. Swartz closed after trading from the same location for 177 years. The buildings were renovated into offices. In 2010, Bertlesen & Schewing was commissioned to restore and transform the building into a restaurant, hotel and office space. ArchitectureSv√¶rtegade 3= No. 3 in 2007 Being built on an irregularly shaped site, considerably deeper to the east (right) than to the west (left), Sv√¶rtegade 3 is five bays wide towards the street but six bays wide towards the yard. The facade towards the street is painted white. The name I. G. Schzartz & S√∏n is still seen on a band above the ground floor and the old house number (No. 170) is still seen above the gate. The facade is finished by a cornice supported by six sculpted corbals. The curved rear side of the building is painted yellow. The red tile roof features three zinc-clad dormer windows with white pediments. The shop fromt from 1847 The three large, arch-headed shop windows in the ground floor, a tell tale feature of commercial properties from the Late Neoclassical period (1830-1855), were a novelty in Denmark at the time. The tracery bars were necessary since it was still not possible to create larger window panes. Below the central shop window is a cellar entrance. The gatrway The gate is topped by a Transom window. The transom feathures the name I. G. Schwartz & S√∏n as well followed by \\"Grundl. I 1801\\" )\\"Founded in 1801\\"). The gateway makes a suttle bend halfway through the building due to the irregular shape of the site and is towards the yard placed in a curved part of the facade. Its barrel vaulted ceiling is richly decorated and the walls are decorated with pilsters with capitels. The floor is paved with timber blocks. A door-less opening in the gateway's wall affords access to the building's main staircase. =Pilestr√¶de 40C= The building in the courtyard The building in the courtyard (Pilestr√¶de 40C), a long, three-storey building constructed on a foundation of stone ashlars, forms the northn margin of the courtyard.

This family has its origins from the Norman Baron Richard Stirmud, although they had declined since then in wealth and power.  Life and career  Geoffrey was likely a close associate to John, King of England when he was count of mortain (before he was king of England). This conclusion is reached from the fact that Sturmy had his lands confiscated temporarily for the part he played in the revolt against Richard I of England in 1194. He began his royal service as a squire in King Johns court. He was given the custody of the lands of the bishopric of Chichester briefly in March 1208 ‚Äì 1209. He was also given temporary custody of the Abbey of Hide along with the Breosa priories. Thomas played an important role in the service of the kings buttery. The kings buttery was a royal department responsible for the storage, transportation, and acquisition of barreled goods, primarily wine. It was headed by the Kings Butler (Bottler).

The social and legal status of women in the Latvian society has been influenced by its history, geopolitical location and culture. Before the 19th century, women were excluded from the political processes, did not have property rights and were expected to run the household. Latvian women were granted the rights to vote after the proclamation of Latvian Independence in 1918. The past decades have seen the gradual transformation of the status and role of women, as Latvia has regained its independence from the Soviet Union and joined intergovernmental organisations, such as the European Union, promoting equality of both genders. Latvia was the first country amongst the former Eastern bloc countries to have a female head of state, former President Vaira Vƒ´ƒ∑e Freiberga. Latvia has also had a female Prime Minister, Laimdota Straujuma. The European Gender Equality Index indicates that Latvia still ranks below the European Union average on gender equality issues, placing 18th out of the 28 member states. Although women make up more than a half of Latvia‚Äôs current population, women are still underrepresented in politics, experience lower wages in comparison to their male counterparts and are still expected to take up the traditional gender role. Accordingly, a relatively recent development has been the struggle of women to find a work-life balance. The notion of gender equality is fairly new in Latvia. In the past decade, synchronously with feminism movements around the world, Latvia has seen its own women‚Äôs movement gradually emerging once again.  History  For further information on Latvia's history see History of Latvia. = Pre-Independence period = Ethnographic research and studies of the common laws of the region, including Latgallian and Curonian, conclude that from the 7th to the 13th century, women in Latvia had no rights to property or rights to vote. Per Inheritance rights, only sons were able to take over the ownership of land. This dictated the social status and role of women in society. Daughters could be bequeathed moveable property only, such as dowry in the form of money, furniture and clothes.≈†vƒÅbe, A. 1921. Latviju kult≈´ras vƒìsture. 1. sƒìjums. SabiedriskƒÅ kult≈´ra. A. Gulbja apgƒÅdnieciba, Rƒ´ga The male guardian of the woman, most commonly the father, brother or husband, instead of the woman, took on the public responsibilities and rights connected to these possessions.leftIn three pre-Christian cemeteries of Lejasbitƒìni, Salaspils Laukskola and ƒåunkƒÅni-Dre≈Üƒ£eri, the archaeological material demonstrate the superior social position of males in society. In all three of these cemeteries, more men than women had been cremated. Cremation was tiresome, labour-intensive undertaking. Thus, it has been proposed that women of high social standing only were cremated, whilst the proportionally higher male cremation can also be explained by men partaking in various conflicts and the Livonian Civil War. In addition, women were frequently not buried in cemeteries as they were taken as prisoners during the recurring raids. The exhumations indicate that women, up until the 19th century in Latvia, had a significantly shorter life span in comparison to men. This can be explained by issues caused by frequent reproduction and inadequate nutrition that their male counterparts didn't experience, as their social position as soldiers earned them the priority of food and medical resources. Childbirth had many risks of complications, as medical aid was limited and older women acted as the midwives. If available, the bathhouse was the most hygienic place for childbirth.Derums, V. 1988. Baltijas sencilvƒìku slimƒ´bas un tautas dziedniecƒ´ba. ZinƒÅtne, Rƒ´ga. For two decades from the age of 20, the Latvian female body went through ongoing distress caused by pregnancy, giving birth and breast-feeding. This caused a reduction in the calcium levels and affected the bone and dental system. Ultimately, all of these factors caused a lower immune system and inability to fight infections. From the 19th century, however, improvements in living standards, education and health care significantly increased the life expectancy of women. Special school for girls that tutored in either Russian or German were established during the 19th century. Achieving education from a peasant background was still difficult.  Latvian folk dress and appearance  Latvian women swinging in folk costumes during a celebration The folk dress had and still has a significant symbolic role in the Latvian society, maintaining the national cultural heritage, it has created a united sense of identity amongst Latvians. The variety in folk costumes displayed social status as well as represented the diversity of regions of Latvia and its traditions by the variation in colour and design. Women wore linen shirts and long skirts, as well as woollen villaines (shawls) and coats of various length. During the period of 7th to the 13th of century, known as the \\"ancient dress\\" period, bronze jewellery was highly popular amongst women; from rings to saktas (Latvian brooches). These were acquired from the trade routes of northern and eastern Europe, as well as the Middle East. Most of the clothing worn by women was sourced and made locally. Garments were made using linen and wool fabric, whilst leather and fur, obtained from wild or domesticated animals were used to fashion shoes. An increasingly present German influence from the 12th century onwards left a significant impact on the fashion of women. Bronze decorations were replaced by silver ones. Latvian brooches, worn to fasten shawls, were decorated with colourful pebbles and beads. This is also when the tradition of knitting woollen mittens, socks and gloves appeared, which just as the skirt worn by Latvian women, represented regional varieties through a difference in colour and the use of ornaments. Records from the second period dating 18th-19th century referred to as the \\"ethnic\\" period, reveal that most of the Latvian peasants still wore flax and fleece fabric clothing, most commonly in the colours of white and grey. The colours of yellow, green, blue and red were used for decorative purposes. Towards the end of the 19th century, the first systemised anthropological data was gathered on forty Latvian women from ages 17-60, by Otto Weber (theologian). Conducting his research in the region of Kurzeme (Courland), he remarked that Latvian women have light skin and fair or light brown hair that is straight or slightly wavy, dark brown hair being a rare observation. The eye colour of Latvian women is blue, grey or a mix of both, with brown eyes being infrequent. Waeber noted that the face is of an oval shape with a straight nose and a mouth of average size, with straight teeth. The height of Latvian women is medium to tall, with a well-built, proportional body. Latvian women are typically not overweight according to Waeber's observations. This study has been supported by various accounts of travellers through Latvia, such as in the 1878 work \\"Picturesque Russia\\". = Independence period = left After the Independence of Latvia in 1918, Latvian women became politically equal to men; both genders over the age of 21, could vote in the Constitutional Assembly elections. From 1917 onwards, women could also be admitted as full-time students in Universities. The studies most often chosen were in sciences and medicine. This serves as a contrast to the rights of Latvian women under the rule of the Russian empire. The chief motive of the women attempting to get elected into the parliament was the passing of legislation that would grant equal rights under the civil and labour law. In the first Constitutional Assembly, 5 out of the 150 elected members were women. However, this number dropped in the elections of the First Saeima in 1922 and it wasn't until 1931, that the first woman deputy, Berta Pƒ´pi≈Üa, was elected into the Parliament. During her time in the Parliament, Berta Pƒ´pi≈Üa advocated legislative changes which would protect women's rights. Masculine rhetoric dominated the Interwar period. During the Inter-war period, women earned significantly less than their male counterparts. Due to longstanding stereotypes of woman's place at home, as a mother and a wife, women were finding it difficult to achieve senior positions. Women‚Äôs rights issues were increasingly being debated. Particularly, the civil laws concerning guardianship and hereditary. Between the two world wars, marriage and fertility were on a decline. This can be attributed to the mid-1930s economic depression. From 1940 to 1945 Latvia was occupied both by the Soviets and the Nazis. As per the ideologies of Communism and Nazism, women took on an important civic role during both of these occupations. During the occupation of the Soviets, women were considered a crucial component of the workforce. Under the Nazis, traditional gender roles were re-enforced with women taking on the role of a wife and a mother once again. = Soviet-era = During the Soviet occupation, in addition to the role of a mother and a wife, women also became workers. In 1989, more than half of the labour force consisted of women. As equal citizens, women received welfare benefits and social security, including health care and child care services. Unemployment was unusual for women in Latvia. Zari√≤a, I, 2001. \\"Trafficking in Women: A Perspective from Latvia\\", Social and Legal Aspects: 201. However, out of the unemployed population of Latvia, majority were women. Those women with higher education tended to be the first ones to be let go during economic downfall. The choice of jobs was largely limited to the \\"female-type\\" jobs, such as secretaries and nurses. Not many women attained managerial positions. Thus, the wages were not equal to the men of Latvia, and women remained dependent on their spouses throughout their lives. Smith suggests that labour equality was not seen as an advantage as it added to the amount of work women had to do. In Soviet Latvia, in most cases, only members of the Latvian Communist Party were able to hold political leadership positions. Only a quarter of Latvian communists by 1945 were women. By 1960s this had increased by nearly 4%. The participation of Latvian women in politics during the Soviet era was very limited, as demonstrated by inactivity in the communist party. Under the Soviet occupation many Latvian women, just as men, were labelled as the \\"enemies of the people\\" and prosecuted. During the 1949 Operation Priboi, approximately 19,535 Latvian women were deported to an exile in Siberia on charges. The operation was directed at those opposed to collective farming and supporting the Latvian resistance movements, such as the Forest Brothers. = Post-Soviet era = With the restoration of Latvia's independence, the political and legislative framework returned to the one established during Latvia's Independence of 1918. Women were once again seen in line with typical gender roles. Women had been active in the awakening process but now saw a regression in women's status and rights. During the Independence movement, several prominent women such as Sarmƒ´te ƒílerte, Sandra Kalniete and Ruta Marja≈°a took up visible roles in the support of Independence. Women against independence from the Soviet Union also rose to prominence, such as Tatjana ≈Ωdanoka who became one of the leaders of Interfront. However, during the Independence movement, women's issues were not the primary concerns. Out of the Baltic states, Latvia has been the only one not to pass separate gender equality legislation. Instead, women's rights are protected by other various legislative acts. According to Irina Novikova, women were not empowered in the political realm, and thus, struggled to secure working rights. In the first democratic elections of the Supreme Council of the Latvian Republic, only five percent of the members elected were women. Women experienced more economic hardship than men did during the post-Communism economic transition, this was largely due to reduced welfare benefits. For example, nearly half of the public childcare services were closed after Latvia regained its independence. Thus, many mothers were forced to quit their jobs. In addition, families needed a double income, and thus, women took on multiple roles within their families and society. This led to an ongoing struggle to find a work-life balance. Trafficking of women and prostitution became a major issue as a result of the drop in the living standards. The lack of regulations and laws led to an expansion of the Latvian sex industry.

The community was named after the House Rock Valley, which was named by the John Wesley Powell Expedition in 1871. (However, the site where the expedition spent the night and the community are on the opposite ends of the valley.) Description The mostly abandoned locale is just east of the Kaibab National Forest and the mouth of House Rock Canyon at the southwest corner of, but just outside of, the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument (which was established in 2000). House Rock is located along what was, prior to 1960, U.S. Route 89 (US 89), but is now U.S. Route 89A (US 89A). Little remains of the community, other than a few houses and a small cemetery, but the site is an important road junction for access to the nearby national monument, being the southern terminus of House Rock Road (BLM Road 1065). Since the monument is surrounded on the north, east, and south sides by the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness Area, the only possible road access is from the west. House Rock Road runs (for about ) along the western edge of the monument, north from House Rock, through the length of the Coyote Valley, to end at US‚Äë89 at the southern end of Five Mile Valley in Kane County, Utah. (The northernmost of the road, north of the Utah State line, the road is also known as House Rock Valley Road.) History Not much information is available regarding specific history of House Rock, but it did begin appear on maps produced by the United States Geological Survey as early as 1936. With the construction of US 89 in the early 20th century, it would likely have been a somewhat significant location, since the nearest communities along US 89 were Jacob Lake (about to the west) and Cliff Dwellers Lodge (about to the east)--that later community of which is sometimes confused with House Rock.

Her father had fought for both the Confederacy and later the Union in the Civil War. Life Triplett was born in 1930 to Mose Triplett and Elida Hall. Her father, who had fought for both the Confederate States and United States during the Civil War, was aged 83 when he married her mother; their union was Mose Triplett's (1846‚Äì1938) second marriage. Irene Triplett grew up on her father's farm in Wilkes County, North Carolina. According to Triplett, she suffered a difficult childhood and was regularly beaten by both her parents and schoolteachers. Classmates teased her about her father whom they denounced as a \\"traitor\\". Triplett's education ended at the sixth grade and, in 1943, she moved with her mother and brother to a poorhouse, where she remained until 1960. She later lived in private nursing homes until her death. According to acquaintances, she was a regular user of chewing tobacco and was a fan of gospel music. Pension Since the death of her father in 1938, Triplett collected $73.13 per month from the Department of Veterans Affairs. She was eligible to inherit her father's pension due to cognitive impairments which she suffered, qualifying her as the helpless child of a veteran. The total amount she received was about $73,000, or $344,000 when adjusted for inflation. Widespread public awareness of Triplett's status occurred in 2013 as the result of a Daily Mail story about her. After the 2018 death of Fred Upham, the son of William H. Upham, she became the last surviving child of a Civil War veteran. Death Triplett died in 2020 at the Accordius Health nursing home in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, as a result of complications arising from a surgery.

Jones was the first African American to graduate with a Ph.D. from the Department of Biomedical Sciences located within the College of Medicine at Florida State University (FSU). As of 2014, only 163 of 4,923 graduate students in a neuroscience/neurobiology program in the US were African American. Jones has dedicated her career to both studying neurological disorders through molecular and systems biology, and to outreach and mentorship for underrepresented minorities to inspire them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.  Early life and education  Jones is a Suffolk, Virginia native who attended Nansemond River High School and later graduated from King's Fork High School in 2006. She then attended Virginia State University (VSU) which is an HBCU located in Petersburg, Virginia. During her undergraduate studies, she explored her first research project within an internship at the College of William and Mary. The project was titled \\"Genetic Analysis of a Cell Cycle Exit Mutation in Caenorhabditis elegans\\" under the guidance of Professor Diane Shakes. Jones then completed a Master's degree at VSU under the guidance of Professor Glenn Harris while taking a systems biology approach to study Non- Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus in mice in a project titled \\"Association between Genetic Variants and Inherited Multi-factorial Diseases\\". In addition, Jones also taught introductory biology courses to undergraduates. Towards the end of her master's program, Jones traveled to Ghana, where her mother's side of the family originated, and taught English, math, and science to young students. It was the excitement of the kids she was teaching that inspired her to pursue a Ph.D., so that she could continue to teach while creating opportunities for students to study-abroad. Jones pursued her doctoral degree within the Department of Biomedical Sciences which is located in the College of Medicine at Florida State University. She was the first African American to earn a PhD from the Department of Biomedical Sciences at FSU, and the first member of her family to earn a PhD. During her doctoral studies, Jones worked under the guidance of Dr. Pradeep Bhide and Deirdre Mc Carthy where she completed a dissertation titled \\"Elucidating the Molecular Etiology of Levodopa Responsive Dystonia\\" and published a manuscript characterizing the \\"Translational Effects and Coding Potential of an Upstream Open Reading Frame Associated with DOPA Responsive Dystonia (DRD)\\". Her research investigated the cellular consequences of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) +142C>T, which introduces an upstream open reading frame (uORF) within the GCH1 gene and also represses GCH1 translation, which is involved in dopamine biosynthesis. The uORF encodes a 73-amino acid peptide, which after protease inhibition disrupts cell viability in the nucleus. This uORF and the +142C>T SNP are associated with a familial form of DOPA Responsive Dystonia, which is a neurological movement disorder that causes involuntary muscle contractions. Jones' research resulted in the generation of an antibody capable of detecting the mutant peptide within human cells; thus improving diagnosis and providing a blueprint for similar research.  Career and research  After earning her Ph.D., Jones worked as a postdoctoral research fellow at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. in the lab of Dr. Masaaki Torii studying brain development in children. Specifically, Jones researched the corpus callosum, which is responsible for the transmission of information between the left and right brain hemispheres. Jones took on two different research projects: studying Plexin-A1 during the postnatal development of the corpus callosum and how Tsc1 impacts lateral dispersion of cortical neurons impacted by Tuberous Sclerosis Complex I. Jones utilized the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) by injecting it into the neurons that travel through the corpus callosum, and observed the level of fluorescence to determine the amount of GFP absorbed in neurons and observing the fluorescent fibers within the corpus callosum. Jones performed experiments like in utero electroporation, microscopy and immunofluorescence to understand how the two sides of the brain communicate in order to find treatments for children with seizures, cognitive defects, and autism. Recently, Jones was selected as an IF/THEN Ambassador by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest general scientific society in the world, which is a role that serves to inspire young girls and women to pursue a future in STEM. In the future, Jones is committed to continue mentoring young students and creating study abroad opportunities throughout her career. Currently, Jones is an Ethics Fellow at the American Society for Microbiology.  Advocacy  Jones has been involved in many different advocacy, mentoring, and outreach programs throughout her career. She was involved in mentoring as a teaching assistant during her undergraduate studies, a course instructor for an introductory biology course during her Master's program, and a research instructor for laboratory classes while pursuing her doctoral degree. As a graduate student, Jones traveled to Ghana to teach English, math, and science to young students and taught young students of underrepresented minorities in Tallahassee within the Young Carver STEM Academy. Jones also volunteered her time as a mentor in the Girls 2 Divas Mentoring Program and as a weekly volunteer at the Ronald McDonald House in Washington, D.C. Jones initiated an outreach program called \\"Young Scientist Wednesdays\\" which allows her to teach patients at Children's National Hospital science through hands on activities, and also through her YouTube channel \\"Hey Dr. Tay\\". Most recently, through selection as an AAAS IF/THEN ambassador, Jones mentors middle school students to inspire young women to pursue STEM careers, and has also received training in communication and storytelling to help improve her advocacy efforts. In January 2020, Jones appeared on the CBS TV show \\"Mission Unstoppable\\" hosted by Miranda Cosgrove, which showcases female trailblazers in STEM fields and is co-produced by Litton Entertainment and the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media. Jones is dedicated to providing a role model to young girls in underrepresented minority groups, as she recognizes the importance of having a mentor that looks like you and has gone through similar experiences as you.

Stack was born in Anglesey, Wales in 1829. She was the daughter of Humphrey Jones, the Controller of Customs at Holyhead. The youngest of nine, Stack was fourteen when she was orphaned, and went to live with relatives, variously in Edinburgh, Stockwell, and Barnstable. In 1856 Stack's brother Humphrey Jones, an Assistant Commissary-General, returned to England from the Crimean War. He was then ordered to New Zealand, and having recently been widowed, invited his sister to join him. Jones and Stack travelled with a maid to New Zealand in 1857 aboard the Dinapore, a journey Stack describes as \\"long and tedious and not marked by any striking incidents\\". Stack enjoyed the musical talents of Andrew Buchanan's daughters, which helped to while away the four month journey. Stack describes collecting a variety of ferns on Waiheke Island with her sister-in-law Emma Jones (nee Buchanan): > \\"The ferns and nikau palms were most graceful and gave the forest quite a > tropical look. We found a great variety of small ferns of which Emma and I > procured some good specimens for our collections.\\" Huruhi, Waiheke Island, > 25 February 1857. Stack collected fern, lichen, seaweed and moss specimens as she travelled around New Zealand. In 1858 Stack was introduced by Mrs Wynyard to Dr Andrew Sinclair, a keen botanist, who offered to help her to identify items in her collection. Later that year, Stack describes a trip to the Pink and White Terraces where she was pleased to have ventured to the top of Te Tarata: > \\"We were very proud of having achieved the rarely accomplished feat and > seized the opportunity to gather specimens of mosses and ferns which have > never been dry and never felt cold. Some of the mosses were a foot high and > we got three varieties of ferns which grew on the brink of the boiling pool, > and procured healthy leaves which were dipping in the hot water. Manuka > shrubs were thriving in the moist heat, as well as ferns and mosses.\\" Te > Tarata, p109 In her journal, Stack also describes collecting weta, lizards and stalactites for her 'museum'. In 1859 she says both Dr Sinclair and Captain Haultain (probably Theodore Haultain) offered to help organise her ferns. Stack's journal describes many occasions hunting ferns and mosses for her collection, often with her brother Humphrey and his wife Emma. On one such trip, in the Remutaka Ranges in 1859, she writes about meeting two botanists sent out by a gardening firm from England, who gave Stack's party some fronds of Lomaria elongata, and exchanged other specimens with Stack. In 28 January 1861 Stack was married to missionary James West Stack by Bishop Selwyn, in St Stephens Chapel, Auckland. The Stacks lived at St Stephen's, Kaiapoi until 5 May 1870, when the buildings were destroyed by fire. After spending a year living in the empty orphanage in Addington, they moved first to Kaiapoi, before building a house on Armagh Street in Christchurch. They had three daughters and four sons. Reduced income due to the loss of Government appointments led to a move to Duvauchelle Bay in 1880. In 1895, the Stacks visited Eliza's brother in Bordighera (her diary says in Spain, but Bordighera is in Italy) for a year. In 1898, the Stacks left New Zealand permanently, living first with Humphrey Jones in Bordighera, and then in 1907, after his death, in Worthing, Sussex. Eliza died aged 90 in Worthing on 2 December 1919, seven weeks after her husband's death. Both are buried in the Christ Church graveyard in Worthing.

A posse caught him from Glimer. He was arrested and a mob of about 1,000 white people stormed the jail and broke down the door with sledgehammers. A noose was placed around his neck and he was dragged by horse to the town square where he was hanged. The mob worked quietly and quickly dispersed after he was killed. The body hung all day before being cut down at 4 o‚Äôclock July 25. Four people were later arrested for the lynching, murder indictments were served for Willie Howell, Charlie Lansdale, Fritz Boyd, and Francis Flanagan. Aftermath These race riots were one of several incidents of civil unrest that began in the so-called American Red Summer of 1919, which included terrorist attacks on black communities and white oppression in over three dozen cities and counties. In most cases, white mobs attacked African American neighborhoods. In some cases, black community groups resisted the attacks, especially in Chicago and Washington DC. Most deaths occurred in rural areas during events like the Elaine Race Riot in Arkansas, where an estimated 100 to 240 black people and 5 white people were killed.

He was one of the most prolific writers of his time, having more than one hundred responsum attributed to him. He is known for his unusually lenient and tolerant attitude towards Halakha which defined his tenure as Gaon, as well as left an impact on the complexion of Babylonian Jewry.  Biography  Rav Sar Shalom was elected to the Gaonate in 838, succeeding Kohen Tzedek ben Abimai. During his time as Gaon, Rav Sar Shalom established a close and extensive relationships with other Jewish communities, such as those in Rome, Spain and especially Kairouan with whom many of his responsum where addressed to. In many of said responsum, he warned the people not to establish halakic institutions which they would not be able to observe, and if he heard that a community had restricted itself by a vow which it later felt unable to comply with, he would use the authority of his office to rescind such an oath.Toratan shel Rishonim i. 47 In almost all of his responsum to neighbouring communities, Rav Sar Shalom writes in a friendly and non condescending tone despite his esteemed position. In most halakic cases, he often points out the differences between Sura and Pumbedita, letting each community choose which academies view suits them the best. Furthermore, he would go onto explain in great detail his halakic reasoning, so that each community could learn the processes of poskening (halakic decision making). His responsum also clearly show that Rav Sar Shalom was very tolerant toward non-Jews, he explicitly prohibited taking advantage of, or in any way infringing upon, the rights of gentiles. Even when there was no Chillul Hashem. \\"Sha'are ·∫íede·∏≥,\\" (Salonica, 1792) Part iv, Gate 1, No. 7 Although, despite his midl and tolerant disposition, he adamantly against money lenders,\\"Sha'are ·∫íede·∏≥,\\" (Salonica, 1792) Part iv, Gate 2, No. 3-4 and encouraged the severe punishment of those men who treat their wives poorly or those women who are rebellious toward their husbands.\\"Sha'are ·∫íede·∏≥,\\" (Salonica, 1792) Part i, Gate 6, No. 3-5 Rav Sar Shalom often interpreted the Bible kabbalisticly. In a particular case, he explained that the thirty cubits' length of the upper curtains of the Temple, represented the thirty generations from Isaac to the King Zedekiah, who witnessed the destruction of Solomon's Temple. Similarly, he also states that the temple Lampstand consisting of twenty-five parts symbolizes the twenty-five generations from Adam to Mose. In 853, Rav Sar Shalom was succeeded as Sura Gaon by Natronai ben Hilai, he shortly died after, passing away in either 859 or 864 in Sura.

The event was created as a response to the Central Park birdwatching incident and police brutality against Black Americans. The inaugural event ran from May 31 to June 5, 2020. The week of events was organized by a group of STEM professionals and students known as the BlackAFinSTEM collective. Origin Black Birders Week was announced on Twitter on May 29, 2020. The initiative was prompted in part by the Central Park birdwatching incident and episodes of killings and police brutality against Black Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. According to co-founder Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, the goal of the initiative is \\"normalizing the fact that Black people exist in the birding and natural sciences community\\". Black people have historically been excluded from academic and professional spaces and lack visibility and representation in the natural sciences community and among birders in particular. Lack of representation also has a chilling effect on the ability to enjoy the outdoors and nature. The week-long event was conceived and organized by members of a group of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals and students known as BlackAFinSTEM collective, founded by Jason Ward. In addition to Opoku-Agyeman, other co-founders include Sheridan Alford, Danielle Belleny, Chelsea Connor, Joseph Saunders, and Tykee James. 2020 Series The event series ran from May 31 to June 5 using the #BlackBirdersWeek hashtag on Twitter and Instagram. Through these events and others, the series highlighted research carried out by Black birders, the happiness they find in nature, the racism experienced, and the importance of inclusivity in the outdoors. Furthermore, the series drew attention to several Black birders and naturalists, including Birds of North America' host Jason Ward, wildlife biologist and author J. Drew Lanham, wildlife conservationist Corina Newsome, National Audubon Society's government affairs coordinator Tykee James, and herpetologist and science communicator Earyn McGee.  Response  In response to the 2020 series, the National Wildlife Federation planned to dedicate part of their Conservation Fellowship and Intern Programs to young biologists of color.The organisers intend to continue the series in future years. The event also inspired other similar week-long events celebrating Black people in various STEM fields, #BlackInAstro week, #BlackBotanistsWeek\\", #BlackInNeuro, and #BlackInChem .  Media coverage  The series was endorsed and promoted by advocacy groups, conservation organizations, and government agencies including: the National Audubon Society, the American Birding Association, the American Bird Conservancy, the North American Association for Environmental Education, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the US National Park Service, the California Coastal Commission, Outdoor Afro, Orion magazine, and the Ecological Society of America. The 2020 series was also highlighted by several science and popular media and news outlets including: CNN, Forbes, The Guardian, Science, Scientific American, National Geographic, Smithsonian magazine, Audubon magazine, Bird Watching magazine, Sierra Club, Backpacker magazine, and NPR.

Like rubidium telluride and caesium telluride, it can be used as an ultraviolet detector in space. Its crystal structure is similar to other tellurides, which have an anti-fluorite structure.  Production  Tellurium will react with melting potassium cyanide (KCN) producing potassium telluride. It also can produced by direct combination of potassium and tellurium, usually in liquid ammonia solvent: :\\\\mathrm{2 \\\\ K + Te \\\\longrightarrow K_2Te}  Reactions  Adding potassium telluride to water and letting the filtrate stand in air leads to an oxidation reaction that generates potassium hydroxide (KOH) and elemental tellurium: :\\\\mathrm{2 \\\\ K_2Te + 2 \\\\ H_2O + O_2 \\\\longrightarrow 4 \\\\ KOH + 2 \\\\ Te}  References  # Sangester J. and Pelton AD; Journal of Phase Equilibria, 1997, 18(4) p. 394\\\\.

Built in 1927, it was significantly renovated between 1980 and 1986. It faces the south side of the Chicago River. A contributing property to the West Loop‚ÄìLaSalle Street Historic District since 2013, it is owned by Tishman Speyer. Originally constructed with 22 stories, the renovation gave it an extra four stories and a western addition that resembles the original. Construction The building as it originally appeared The building was constructed in 1927 and formally opened on June 29. Its construction was due to the efforts of the Chicago Builders' Building Corporation, which was composed of a variety of entities in the construction trade such as companies, individuals, and trade groups. It was intended to house the offices of construction companies, and included an atrium for use as an exhibition space. The design was by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White. The address was formerly 228 North LaSalle Street. The original design is styled in the Classical Revival fashion and is 22 stories tall. Its facades are divided into three parts of base, shaft, and capital, which are separated from one another via belt courses. The base is clad in limestone while the shaft and capital have terra cotta elements. The building originally had a cornice, which has since been removed. The facades face LaSalle Street and Wacker Drive, the latter of which had recently been completed as a multi-level street. The building was built to accommodate and use this, containing an area for trucks using the lower part of Wacker Drive to make deliveries as well as an underground parking garage. Subsequent history and renovation Although originally housing construction companies, the Great Depression's negative impact on the industry led to other tenants moving in. The Chicago Board of Education would eventually occupy a large portion of the building. The building was renovated by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill from 1980 to 1986\\\\. This was done with the collaboration of Tishman Speyer and the Crown family, who wished to open an all-suite hotel in the building to house business travelers. The so-called Puzzles Grand Club Suites was planned to open in July 1987 and comprise 62 suites occupying the sixth and seventh stories of the building; further locations in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco were planned to open in 1988. The renovation gave the building an additional four stories, which are provided in a slanted glass facade set back from the originals. It also produced an addition which reaches the same height as the rest of the building and which faces Wells Street. The addition has broadly the same architectural style as the remainder of the building, and allows the building to occupy the entirety of its half-block. Skidmore, Owings & Merrill received a citation of merit from the Chicago branch of the American Institute of Architects in 1987 for the renovation, with special attention given to the restoration of a rotunda. The building is a contributing property to the West Loop‚ÄìLaSalle Street Historic District, which was entered into the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. The building is owned by Tishman Speyer. It has of office space and a LEED Silver Certification.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, northwest of Mount Adams, east-northeast of Mount Saint Helens, and south of Mount Rainier. Its nearest higher neighbor is Sunrise Peak, to the north-northeast. Precipitation runoff from Jumbo Peak drains into tributaries of the Cowlitz River drainage basin. The Juniper Ridge Trail (#261) which skirts this peak provides access to this remote peak. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. Mount Adams, a stratovolcano that is southeast of Jumbo Peak, began forming in the Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Due to Mount Saint Helens' proximity to Jumbo Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area. Jumbo Peak is composed of Pliocene-Miocene andesitic magma that intruded up into older volcanic rocks more than five million years ago and is now surrounded by a forest of old- growth Douglas fir and mountain hemlock. Climate Jumbo Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.

Unchoreographed self-organized stochastic noise (failures) should be not only tolerated, but is essential for innovation, because. Hence, learning is an important aspect of innovation. Learning, however, requires the foundation of psychological safety and secure emotional attachment to provide the resilience necessary for risking new things despite the likelihood of failure.

To successfully navigate the VUCA environment, Sunnie Giles, an expert on radical innovation, asserts that organizations must harness complexity rather than trying to control or reduce it. Efforts to reduce external complexity made companies successful in the industrial era (post Industrial Revolution, before the digital revolution), using tools such as Six Sigma and ERP. But the business environment has changed from complicated to complex, and these efforts no longer lead organizations to success. Instead they need to harness complexity by increasing the variety of input (diversity of thought), speed of communication, interdependence among employees, and density of interactions among employees. All of these efforts lead to learning from profuse experimentation‚Äîthe spontaneous result of which is enabled by psychological safety and secure connection among team members.

The park was severely damaged by the Soberanes fire and is closed indefinitely. When open, it is only accessible via trail from the road. Access was limited to six visitors per day who had to obtain a permit in advance from the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District. The preserve was pieced together with several large properties between 1988 and 2000 for costs totaling $2 million.  History  The land to the south of Palo Colorado Canyon was formerly owned by Charles Henry Bixby, namesake of the Bixby Creek Bridge. In 1906, when the available commercial timber was depleted, Bixby sold his land to the Monterey Lime Company. Lime was in demand as an ingredient in concrete to help re-build San Francisco following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The company built a aerial tram to transport the limestone from Long Ridge to Bixby Landing, a small community that grew up around the Bixby Homestead. Eventually, the exhaustion of local fuel, wood and high operating costs closed the kilns in 1910. The tram remained in business for a time to off and on-load supplies for the community from schooners. Activity picked up in 1917 when Pacific Grove's T. A. Work and A. W. Furlong built and operated a logging mill further up the canyon in the preserve. Local Japanese from the peninsula were hired, a camp was constructed, and several steam-donkeys were brought in from San Francisco. Most of the lumber was hoisted up out of the canyon by cables and down what is now Palo Colorado Canyon Road by oxen. The mill was closed in 1935 after the marketable timber was cut. Logging was renewed in 1946 when Charles Vander Ploeg built a mill in Beartrap Canyon. This mill was short-lived when a human-caused fire in 1949 destroyed the mill and killed two loggers. Evidence suggests that the redwood logging at that time was for fence posts. Logging once again found its way into the preserve for a few years in the early ‚Äò60's. This time the trees were cut in the Turner Creek drainage. This area is in the very upper reach of the canyon and the logging was sporadic and selective. By 1986 the Humboldt County-based Philo Lumber Company owned the land. Their plan to harvest over a million board feet of redwood and then build upscale residences in the area was only derailed by the savings and loan crisis, when the land was seized by federal financial regulators. After two years of negotiations the Federal Land Bank sold the property to the Big Sur Land Trust, which in turn sold it to the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District in 1988.  Trails  The district joined the seized land with three adjacent properties to form the Mill Creek Redwood Preserve. The park district trail boss Chris Reed worked with AmeriCorps volunteers and prison crews to build a trail from Palo Colorado Road to an overlook, which was completed over eight years. The trail was opened on June 30, 2006. An loop trail is also planned. Limited access Responding to concerns of canyon residents about traffic on narrow Palo Colorado Road, the county agreed to limit access to six permits per day. When open, visitors are required to obtain a permit in advance from the Monterey Peninsula Regional Park District. The trail head is located inland on Palo Colorado Road.  Closure  The preserve was closed when the Soberanes Fire was started by campers in Garrapata Canyon who left a fire untended on July 22, 2016. The fire burned through Palo Colorado Canyon in less than two days, destroying 57 homes and 11 outbuildings in the Garrapata and Palo Colorado Canyon areas. The following winter Rocky Creek washed out the Palo Colorado road, and additional slides and slip outs closed the road. Monterey County states that it does not have the funds to repair the road, preventing visitors from accessing the park. The preserve was also severely damaged by the fire and is closed indefinitely.

Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty on 3 September 1939, the day that the United Kingdom declared war on Nazi Germany. He succeeded Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister on 10 May 1940 and held the post until 26 July 1945. Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British rearmament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As Prime Minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy. First Lord of the Admiralty: September 1939 to May 1940The Phoney War and the Norwegian Campaign= Joseph Kennedy in 1939. On 3 September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany following the outbreak of the Second World War, Chamberlain appointed Churchill as First Lord of the Admiralty, the same position he had held at the beginning of the First World War. As such he was a member of Chamberlain's war cabinet. Churchill later claimed that, on learning of his appointment, the Board of the Admiralty sent a signal to the Fleet: \\"Winston is back\\". Although this story was repeated by Lord Mountbatten in a speech at Edmonton in 1966, Richard Langworth notes that neither he nor Churchill's official biographer Martin Gilbert have found contemporary evidence to confirm it, suggesting that it may well be a later invention. As First Lord, Churchill proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called \\"Phoney War\\", when the only significant action by British forces was at sea. Churchill was ebullient after the Battle of the River Plate on 13 December 1939 and afterwards welcomed home the crews, congratulating them on \\"a brilliant sea fight\\" and saying that their actions in a cold, dark winter had \\"warmed the cockles of the British heart\\". On 16 February 1940, Churchill personally ordered Captain Philip Vian of the destroyer HMS Cossack to board the German supply ship Altmark in Norwegian waters and liberate some 300 British prisoners who had been captured by the Admiral Graf Spee. These actions, supplemented by his speeches, considerably enhanced Churchill's reputation. He was concerned about German naval activity in the Baltic Sea and initially wanted to send a naval force there but this was soon changed to a plan, codenamed Operation Wilfred, to mine Norwegian waters and stop iron ore shipments from Narvik to Germany. There were disagreements about mining, both in the war cabinet and with the French government. As a result, Wilfred was delayed until 8 April 1940, the day before the German invasion of Norway was launched. =The Norway Debate and Chamberlain's resignation= After the Allies failed to prevent the German occupation of Norway, the Commons held an open debate from 7 to 9 May on the government's conduct of the war. This has come to be known as the Norway Debate and is renowned as one of the most significant events in parliamentary history. On the second day (Wednesday, 8 May), the Labour opposition called for a division which was in effect a vote of no confidence in Chamberlain's government. There was considerable support for Churchill on both sides of the House but, as a member of the government, he was obliged to speak on its behalf. He was called upon to wind up the debate, which placed him in the difficult position of having to defend the government without damaging his own prestige. Although the government won the vote, its majority was drastically reduced amid calls for a national government to be formed. In the early hours of 10 May, German forces invaded Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as a prelude to their assault on France. Since the division vote, Chamberlain had been trying to form a coalition but Labour declared on the Friday afternoon that they would not serve under his leadership, although they would accept another Conservative. The only two candidates were Churchill and Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary. The matter had already been discussed at a meeting on the 9th between Chamberlain, Halifax, Churchill, and David Margesson, the government Chief Whip. Halifax admitted that he could not govern effectively as a member of the House of Lords and so Chamberlain advised the King to send for Churchill, who became prime minister. His first act was to write to Chamberlain and thank him for his support. Churchill later wrote of feeling a profound sense of relief in that he now had authority over the whole scene. He believed himself to be walking with destiny and that his life so far had been \\"a preparation for this hour and for this trial\\". : 1940‚Äì1945Dunkirk to Pearl Harbor: May 1940 to December 1941= Churchill takes aim with a Sten sub-machine gun in June 1941. The man in the pin-striped suit and fedora to the right is his bodyguard, Walter H. Thompson. Initial reaction to Churchill as Premier In May, Churchill was still unpopular with many Conservatives, with probably the majority of the Labour Party, and with the so-called Establishment ‚Äì Jenkins says his accession to the premiership was \\"at best the equivalent of an abrupt wartime marriage\\". He probably could not have won a majority in any of the political parties in the House of Commons, and the House of Lords was completely silent when it learned of his appointment. Chamberlain remained Conservative Party leader until October when ill health forced his resignation ‚Äì he died of cancer in November. By that time, Churchill had won the doubters over and his succession as party leader was a formality. Ralph Ingersoll reported in November: \\"Everywhere I went in London people admired [Churchill's] energy, his courage, his singleness of purpose. People said they didn't know what Britain would do without him. He was obviously respected. But no one felt he would be Prime Minister after the war. He was simply the right man in the right job at the right time. The time being the time of a desperate war with Britain's enemies\\". War ministry created The war energised Churchill, who was 65 years old when he became Prime Minister. Stating that he was the only top leader from World War I who still had an important political job, John Gunther wrote in 1940 that Churchill \\"looks ten years younger than he is\\". H. R. Knickerbocker wrote in 1941 that \\"The responsibilities which are his now must be greater than those carried by any other human being on earth. One would think such a weight would have a crushing effect upon him. Not at all. The last time I saw him, while the Battle of Britain was still raging, he looked twenty years younger than before the war began ... His uplifted spirit is transmitted to the people\\". Churchill began his premiership by forming a five-man war cabinet which included Chamberlain as Lord President of the Council, Labour leader Clement Attlee as Lord Privy Seal (later as Deputy Prime Minister), Halifax as Foreign Secretary and Labour's Arthur Greenwood as a minister without portfolio. In practice, these five were augmented by the service chiefs and ministers who attended the majority of meetings. The cabinet changed in size and membership as the war progressed. By the end of 1940, it had increased to eight after Churchill, Attlee and Greenwood were joined by Ernest Bevin as Minister of Labour and National Service; Anthony Eden as Foreign Secretary ‚Äì replacing Halifax, who was sent to Washington D.C. as ambassador to the United States; Lord Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production; Sir Kingsley Wood as Chancellor of the Exchequer; and Sir John Anderson as Lord President of the Council ‚Äì replacing Chamberlain who died in November (Anderson later became Chancellor after Kingsley Wood's death in September 1943). Jenkins described this combination as a \\"war cabinet for winning\\", contrasting it with Chamberlain's \\"war cabinet for losing\\". In response to previous criticisms that there had been no clear single minister in charge of the prosecution of the war, Churchill created and took the additional position of Minister of Defence, making him the most powerful wartime prime minister in British history. Churchill wanted people he knew and trusted to take part in government. Among these were personal friends like Beaverbrook and Frederick Lindemann, who became the government's scientific advisor. Lindemann was one of several outside exports drafted in and these \\"technocrats\\" fulfilled vital functions, especially on the Home Front. Churchill would proudly proclaim that his government, in the interests of national unity, was the most broadly based in British political history as it spanned far right to far left by including such figures as Lord Lloyd on the right and Ellen Wilkinson on the left. Resolve to fight on At the end of May, with the British Expeditionary Force in retreat to Dunkirk and the Fall of France seemingly imminent, Halifax proposed that the government should explore the possibility of a negotiated peace settlement using Mussolini as an intermediary given that Italy was still neutral. There were several high-level meetings from 26 to 28 May, including two with the French premier Paul Reynaud. Churchill's resolve was to fight on, even if France capitulated, but his position remained precarious until Chamberlain resolved to support him. Churchill had the full support of the two Labour members but knew he could not survive as prime minister if both Chamberlain and Halifax were against him. In the end, by gaining the support of his outer cabinet, Churchill outmanoeuvred Halifax and won Chamberlain over. The essence of Churchill's argument was that, as he said, \\"it was idle to think that, if we tried to make peace now, we should get better terms than if we fought it out\\". He therefore concluded that the only option was to fight on though, at times, he personally was pessimistic about the chances of a British victory, as on 12 June 1940 when he told General Hastings Ismay that \\"[y]ou and I will be dead in three months' time\\". Nonetheless, his use of rhetoric hardened public opinion against a peaceful resolution and prepared the British people for a long war ‚Äì Jenkins says Churchill's speeches were \\"an inspiration for the nation, and a catharsis for Churchill himself\\". Importance of Churchill's wartime speeches Churchill walks through the ruins of Coventry Cathedral with Alfred Robert Grindlay, 1941. Churchill's wartime speeches were a great inspiration to the embattled British, beginning with his first as prime minister, which he had delivered to the Commons on 13 May: the \\"blood, toil, tears and sweat\\" speech. It was not well-received at the time, mainly because the majority of Conservative MPs held doubts about Churchill's suitability to be premier. It was in fact little more than a short statement but, Jenkins says, \\"it included phrases which have reverberated down the decades\\". Churchill made it plain to the nation that a long, hard road lay ahead and that victory was the final goal: Operation Dynamo and the Battle of France Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of 338,226 Allied servicemen from Dunkirk, ended on Tuesday, 4 June when the French rearguard surrendered. The total was far in excess of expectations and it gave rise to a popular view that Dunkirk had been a miracle, and even a victory. Churchill himself referred to \\"a miracle of deliverance\\" in his \\"we shall fight on the beaches\\" speech to the Commons that afternoon, though he shortly reminded everyone that: \\"We must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations\\". The speech ended on a note of defiance coupled with a clear appeal to the United States: Germany initiated Fall Rot the following day and Italy entered the war on the 10th. The Wehrmacht occupied Paris on the 14th and completed their conquest of France on 25 June. It was now inevitable that Hitler would attack and probably try to invade Great Britain. Faced with this, Churchill addressed the Commons on 18 June and delivered one of his most famous speeches, ending with this peroration: Churchill was determined to fight back and ordered the commencement of the Western Desert campaign on 11 June, an immediate response to the Italian declaration of war. This went well at first while the Italian army was the sole opposition and Operation Compass was a noted success. In early 1941, however, Mussolini requested German support and Hitler sent the Afrika Korps to Tripoli under the command of Generalleutnant Erwin Rommel, who arrived not long after Churchill had halted Compass so that he could reassign forces to Greece where the Balkans campaign was entering a critical phase. In other initiatives through June and July 1940, Churchill ordered the formation of both the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Commandos. The SOE was ordered to promote and execute subversive activity in Nazi-occupied Europe while the Commandos were charged with raids on specific military targets there. Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, took political responsibility for the SOE and recorded in his diary that Churchill told him: \\"And now go and set Europe ablaze\\". The Battle of Britain and the Blitz On 20 August 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain, Churchill addressed the Commons to outline the war situation. In the middle of this speech, he made a statement that created a famous nickname for the RAF fighter pilots involved in the battle: The Luftwaffe altered its strategy from 7 September 1940 and began to bomb London, at first in daylight raids and then, after their losses became unacceptably high, at night. The raids were soon extended to provincial cities such as the notorious attack on Coventry on 14 November. The Blitz was especially intensive through October and November. It can be said to have continued for eight months, by which time Hitler was ready to launch Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the USSR. The Luftwaffe failed its objective of reducing British war production, which actually increased. Churchill used to watch air raids from the Whitehall rooftops and was all for intensive anti-aircraft barrages, regardless of whether anything was being hit or not. He was totally opposed to proposals that the seat of government should be removed to Worcestershire and made extensive use of the Cabinet War Rooms below the Treasury building. His morale during the Blitz was generally high and he told his private secretary John Colville in November that he thought the threat of invasion was past. He was confident that Great Britain could hold its own, given the increase in output, but was realistic about its chances of actually winning the war without American intervention. Lend- Lease In September 1940, the British and American governments concluded the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, by which fifty American destroyers were transferred to the Royal Navy in exchange for free US base rights in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Newfoundland. An added advantage for Britain was that its military assets in those bases could be redeployed elsewhere. Churchill's good relations with United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt helped secure vital food, oil and munitions via the North Atlantic shipping routes. Between 1939 and 1945 they exchanged an estimated 1700 letters and telegrams and met 11 times; Churchill estimated that they had 120 days of close personal contact. It was for this reason that Churchill was relieved when Roosevelt was re-elected in 1940. Upon re-election, Roosevelt set about implementing a new method of providing necessities to Great Britain without the need for monetary payment. He persuaded Congress that repayment for this immensely costly service would take the form of defending the US. The policy was known as Lend- Lease and it was formally enacted on 11 March 1941. Operation Barbarossa Hitler launched his invasion of the Soviet Union on Sunday, 22 June 1941. It was no surprise to Churchill who had known since early April, from Enigma decrypts at Bletchley Park, that the attack was imminent. He had tried to warn General Secretary Joseph Stalin via the British ambassador to Moscow, Stafford Cripps, but to no avail as Stalin did not trust Churchill. The night before the attack, already intending an address to the nation, Churchill alluded to his hitherto anti-communist views by saying to Colville: \\"If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil\\". Atlantic Charter In August 1941, Churchill made his first transatlantic crossing of the war on board HMS Prince of Wales and met Roosevelt in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. On 14 August, they issued the joint statement that has become known as the Atlantic Charter. This outlined the goals of both countries for the future of the world and it is seen as the inspiration for the 1942 Declaration by United Nations, itself the basis of the United Nations which was founded in June 1945. =Pearl Harbor to D-Day: December 1941 to June 1944=Pearl Harbor and United States entry into the war On 7‚Äì8 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was followed by their invasion of Malaya and, on the 8th, Churchill declared war on Japan. Three days later came the joint declaration of war by Germany and Italy against the United States. Churchill went to Washington later in the month to meet Roosevelt for the first Washington Conference (codename Arcadia). This was important for \\"Europe First\\", the decision to prioritise victory in Europe over victory in the Pacific, taken by Roosevelt while Churchill was still in mid-Atlantic. The Americans agreed with Churchill that Hitler was the main enemy and that the defeat of Germany was key to Allied success. It was also agreed that the first joint Anglo-American strike would be Operation Torch, the invasion of French North Africa (i.e., Algeria and Morocco). Originally planned for the spring of 1942, it was finally launched in November 1942 when the crucial Second Battle of El Alamein was already underway. On 26 December, Churchill addressed a joint meeting of the US Congress. While he was well-received, he was concerned that his anti-Japanese rhetoric met with greater enthusiasm than his anti-German statements. That night, Churchill suffered a mild heart attack which was diagnosed by his physician, Lord Moran, as a coronary deficiency needing several weeks' bed rest. Churchill insisted that he did not need bed rest and, two days later, journeyed on to Ottawa by train where he gave a speech to the Canadian Parliament that included the \\"some chicken, some neck\\" line in which he recalled French predictions in 1940 that \\"Britain alone would have her neck wrung like a chicken\\". Churchill arrived home in mid-January, having flown from Bermuda to Plymouth in an American flying boat, and soon found that there was a crisis of confidence in both his coalition government and himself personally. While he was away, the Eighth Army, having already relieved the Siege of Tobruk, had pursued Operation Crusader against Rommel's forces in Libya, successfully driving them back to a defensive position at El Agheila in Cyrenaica. On 21 January 1942, however, Rommel launched a surprise counter- attack which drove the Allies back to Gazala. Meanwhile, recent British success in the Battle of the Atlantic was compromised by the Kriegsmarine's introduction of its M4 4-rotor Enigma, whose signals could not be decyphered by Bletchley Park for nearly a year. In the Far East, the news was much worse with Japanese advances in all theatres, especially at sea and in Malaya. At a press conference in Washington, Churchill had to play down his increasing doubts about the security of Singapore. Problems in Parliament and the War Cabinet Churchill on his return from America was aware of parliamentary and public criticism because, after nearly two years of his premiership, the end of the war was nowhere in sight. He decided to insist upon a full three- day Commons debate, through 27‚Äì29 January, on a vote of confidence. He opened on a note of some resentment: Despite his concerns, he won easily enough with 464 votes in his favour and only one against, in a House of 640. Many MPs were unavailable for war service reasons. Churchill's gloom persisted, though, and he faced another problem when Sir Stafford Cripps returned from Moscow, where he had been British ambassador since May 1940. On the evening of Sunday, 8 February, Cripps broadcast to the nation about the Soviet war effort and compared it to the perceived \\"lack of urgency\\" in Britain where the population were almost \\"spectators rather than participants\\". This happened soon after a blazing row between Bevin and Beaverbrook which undermined the war cabinet. The latter had just become Minister of War Production but, on 19 February and citing a \\"nervous breakdown\\", he resigned from the government. He was replaced in early March by Oliver Lyttelton and the job was retitled Minister of Production. Churchill was concerned about Cripps' obvious public popularity and, sensing a challenge to his premiership, realised that he needed Cripps in the government. On 15 February, he appointed Cripps as Leader of the House of Commons and Lord Privy Seal. Attlee stepped up to become both Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. Through the spring of 1942, Churchill's spirits rose as things settled down in cabinet and there was no especially bad news, although still a lack of triumph. He welcomed US emissaries Harry Hopkins and General George Marshall in April. They had been sent by Roosevelt to discuss the feasibility of a cross-Channel invasion, as Roosevelt was keen to take pressure off the Soviets who were still on the back foot. At this time, 1942 was practically impossible and it was hoped to open a Channel front in 1943. The Americans were focused on Europe and Churchill raised his concerns about the possible losses of both India and Egypt, but the Americans were not concerned about India. Operation Torch was still on the agenda as regards North Africa. Fall of Singapore and loss of Burma Churchill already had grave concerns about the fighting quality of British troops after the defeats in Norway, France, Greece and Crete. Following the fall of Singapore to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, he felt that his misgivings were confirmed and said: \\"(this is) the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British military history\\". More bad news had come on 11 February as the Kriegsmarine pulled off its audacious \\"Channel Dash\\", a massive blow to British naval prestige. The combined effect of these events was to sink Churchill's morale to its lowest point of the whole war. Japanese operations in Burma had begun in December 1941. Rangoon fell in March 1942 and the Japanese advance gathered pace until they had occupied most of the country by the end of April. Campaigning was effectively halted through the May to December monsoon season and then the Allies mounted the first of several offensives from India. Efforts were hampered by disordered conditions in Bengal and Bihar, not least the severe cyclone which devastated the region in October 1942 and, with vital rice imports from Burma curtailed by the Japanese, led ultimately to the Bengal famine of 1943. The situation in Bengal was exacerbated by a Japanese air offensive which prevented the RAF from launching an airlift. It has been alleged that Churchill's government was wrong in its prioritisation of food exports to other theatres of war and its stockpiling of resources in Great Britain, but those policies were pursued because Churchill's main concern was fighting a war for survival. This, however, is an area of great dispute and is thus disputed as CAB 65 Second World War conclusions, clearly, show that food exports (except those already in motion) were canceled, these now canceled food exports were consequently used as famine relief . Nevertheless, he did push for whatever famine relief efforts India itself could provide, but these were hidebound by corruption and inefficiency in the Bengali government. Churchill responded by appointing Earl Wavell as Viceroy on 1 October 1943 and ordering the military under Wavell's direction to transport aid into Bengal. The combination of relief transports and a successfully harvested winter rice crop eased the famine in December 1943, but the death toll by then was over three million. International conferences in 1942 On 20 May, the Soviet Foreign Affairs minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, arrived in London and stayed until the 28th before going on to Washington. The purpose of this visit was to sign a treaty of friendship but Molotov wanted it done on the basis of certain territorial concessions re Poland and the Baltic States. Churchill and Eden worked for a compromise and eventually a twenty-year treaty was formalised but with the question of frontiers placed on hold. Molotov was also seeking a Second Front in Europe but all Churchill could do was confirm that preparations were in progress and make no promises on a date. Churchill felt well pleased with these negotiations and said as much when he contacted Roosevelt on the 27th. The previous day, however, Rommel had launched his counter-offensive, Operation Venice, to begin the Battle of Gazala. The Allies were ultimately driven out of Libya and suffered a major defeat in the loss of Tobruk on 21 June. Churchill was with Roosevelt when the news of Tobruk reached him. He was shocked by the surrender of 35,000 troops which was, apart from Singapore, \\"the heaviest blow\\" he received in the war. The Axis advance was eventually halted at the battles of El Alamein (first battle; July) and Alam el Halfa (early September). Both sides were exhausted and in urgent need of reinforcements and supplies. Churchill had returned to Washington on 17 June. He and Roosevelt agreed on the implementation of Operation Torch as the necessary precursor to an invasion of Europe. Roosevelt had appointed General Dwight D. Eisenhower as commanding officer of the European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). Having received the news from North Africa, Churchill obtained shipment from America to the Eighth Army of 300 Sherman tanks and 100 howitzers. He returned to Britain on 25 June. Churchill came back to another motion of no confidence, this time in the central direction of the war, which meant him personally and was a direct reaction to the fall of Tobruk. The petitioners were a cross-party spread. The debate was held 1‚Äì2 July and opened with the news that Rommel was only forty miles from Alexandria while, the previous week, the government had lost a bye-election to an independent candidate, the first of several in which Conservative majorities were overturned. Jenkins describes the rebel motion in Parliament as \\"a fiasco\\", its speakers not being co-ordinated. One of them, the seconder of the motion who was targeting the Chiefs of Staff, even declared that it would be a \\"deplorable disaster\\" if Churchill had to go. Even so, 25 votes were cast against Churchill, with 477 in favour, and he drew some comfort from being told that the government of William Pitt the Younger conceded 25 votes after a similar debate in 1799. In August, despite health concerns, Churchill visited the British forces in North Africa, raising morale in the process, en route to Moscow for his first meeting with Stalin. He was accompanied by Roosevelt's special envoy Averell Harriman. He was in Moscow 12‚Äì16 August and had four lengthy meetings with Stalin. Although they got along quite well together on a personal level, there was little chance of any real progress given the state of the war with the Germans still advancing in all theatres. Stalin was desperate for the Allies to open the Second Front in Europe, as Churchill had discussed with Molotov in May, and the answer was the same. Turn of the tide: El Alamein and Stalingrad While he was in Cairo in early August, Churchill decided to replace Field Marshal Auchinleck with Field Marshal Alexander as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Theatre. Command of the Eighth Army was given to General William Gott but he was killed only three days later and General Montgomery replaced him. Churchill returned to Cairo from Moscow on 17 August and could see for himself that the Alexander/Montgomery combination was already having an effect. He returned to England on the 21st, nine days before Rommel launched his final offensive. As 1942 drew to a close, the tide of war began to turn with Allied victory in the key battles of El Alamein and Stalingrad. Until November, the Allies had always been on the defensive, but from November, the Germans were. Churchill ordered the church bells to be rung throughout Great Britain for the first time since early 1940. On 10 November, knowing that El Alamein was a victory, he delivered one of his most memorable war speeches to the Lord Mayor's Luncheon at the Mansion House in London, in response to the Allied victory at El Alamein: El Alamein was fought 23 October to 11 November and was a resounding victory for the Eighth Army with Rommel's forces in full retreat. The Americans under Eisenhower had successfully completed Torch on 8 November and the Afrika Korps was now facing formidable opposition on two fronts. The conflict at Stalingrad lasted for over five months but the key date was 23 November when the Germans were encircled. International conferences in 1943 Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill in Tehran. Generalissimo Chiang Kai- shek, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Churchill at the first Cairo Conference in November 1943. In January 1943, Churchill met Roosevelt at the Casablanca Conference (codename Symbol), which lasted ten days. It was also attended by General Charles de Gaulle on behalf of the Free French Forces. Stalin had hoped to attend but declined because of the situation at Stalingrad. Although Churchill expressed doubts on the matter, the so-called Casablanca Declaration committed the Allies to securing \\"unconditional surrender\\" by the Axis powers. From Morocco, Churchill went to Cairo, Adana, Cyprus, Cairo again and Algiers for various purposes. He arrived home on 7 February having been out for the country for nearly a month. He addressed the Commons on the 11th and then became seriously ill with pneumonia the following day, necessitating more than one month of rest, recuperation and convalescence ‚Äì for the latter, he moved to Chequers. He returned to work in London on 15 March. Churchill made two transatlantic crossings during the year, meeting Roosevelt at both the third Washington Conference (codename Trident) in May and the first Quebec Conference (codename Quadrant) in August. In November, Churchill and Roosevelt met Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek at the Cairo Conference (codename Sextant). The most important conference of the year was soon afterwards (28 November to 1 December) at Tehran (codename Eureka), where Churchill and Roosevelt met Stalin in the first of the \\"Big Three\\" meetings, preceding those at Yalta and Potsdam in 1945. Roosevelt and Stalin co-operated in persuading Churchill to commit to the opening of a second front in western Europe and it was also agreed that Germany would be divided after the war, but no firm decisions were made about how. On their way back from Tehran, Churchill and Roosevelt held a second Cairo conference with Turkish president Ismet In√∂n√º, but were unable to gain any commitment from Turkey to join the Allies. Churchill went from Cairo to Tunis, arriving on 10 December, initially as Eisenhower's guest (soon afterwards, Eisenhower took over as Supreme Allied Commander of the new SHAEF just being created in London). While Churchill was in Tunis, he became seriously ill with atrial fibrillation and was forced to remain until after Christmas while a succession of specialists were drafted in to ensure his recovery. Clementine and Colville arrived to keep him company; Colville had just returned to Downing Street after more than two years in the RAF. On 27 December, the party went on to Marrakesh for convalescence. Feeling much better, Churchill flew to Gibraltar on 14 January 1944 and sailed home on the King George V. He was back in London on the morning of 18 January and surprised MPs by attending Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons that afternoon. Since 12 January 1943, when he set off for the Casablanca Conference, Churchill had been abroad and/or seriously ill for 203 of the 371 days. Invasions of Sicily and Italy In the autumn of 1942, after Churchill's meeting with Stalin in Moscow, he was approached by Eisenhower, commanding North African Theater of Operations (NATOUSA), and his aides on the subject of where the Western Allies should launch their first strike in Europe. According to General Mark Clark, who later commanded the United States Fifth Army in the Italian campaign, the Americans openly admitted that a cross-Channel operation in the near future was \\"utterly impossible\\". As an alternative, Churchill recommended \\"slit(ting) the soft belly of the Mediterranean\\" and persuaded them to invade first Sicily and then Italy after they had defeated the Afrika Korps in North Africa. After the war, Clark still agreed that Churchill's analysis was correct but he added that, when the Allies landed at Salerno, they found that Italy was \\"a tough old gut\\". The invasion of Sicily began on 9 July and was successfully completed by 17 August. Churchill was then all for driving straight up the Italian mainland with Rome as the main target, but the Americans wanted to withdraw several divisions to England in the build-up of forces for Operation Overlord, now scheduled for the spring of 1944. Churchill was still not keen on Overlord as he feared that an Anglo-American army in France might not be a match for the fighting efficiency of the Wehrmacht. He preferred peripheral operations, including a plan called Jupiter for an invasion of northern Norway. Events in Sicily had an unexpected impact in Italy. King Victor Emmanuel sacked Mussolini on 25 July and appointed Marshal Badoglio as prime minister. Badoglio opened negotiations with the Allies which resulted in the Armistice of Cassibile on 3 September. In response, the Germans activated Operation Achse and took control of most of Italy. Although he still preferred Italy to Normandy as the Allies' main route into the Third Reich, Churchill was deeply concerned about the strong German resistance at Salerno and, later, after the Allies successfully gained their bridgehead at Anzio but still failed to break the stalemate, he caustically said that instead of \\"hurling a wildcat onto the shore\\", the Allied force had become a \\"stranded whale\\". The big obstacle was Monte Cassino and it was not until mid-May 1944 when it was finally overcome, enabling the Allies to at last advance on Rome, which was taken on 4 June. Preparations for D-Day The difficulties in Italy caused Churchill to have a change of heart and mind about Allied strategy to the extent that, when the Anzio stalemate developed soon after his return to England from North Africa, he threw himself into the planning of Overlord and set up an ongoing series of meetings with SHAEF and the British Chiefs of Staff over which he regularly presided. These were always attended by either Eisenhower or his chief of staff General Walter Bedell Smith. Churchill was especially taken by the Mulberry project but he was also keen to make the most of Allied air power which, by the beginning of 1944, had become overwhelming. Churchill never fully lost his apprehension about the invasion, however, and underwent great fluctuation of mood as D-Day approached. Jenkins says that he faced potential victory with much less buoyancy than when he defiantly faced the prospect of defeat four years earlier. Need for post-war reform Churchill could not ignore the need for post-war reforms covering a broad sweep of areas such as agriculture, education, employment, health, housing and welfare. The Beveridge Report with its five \\"Giant Evils\\" was published in November 1942 and assumed great importance amid widespread popular acclaim. Even so, Churchill was not really interested because he was focused on winning the war and saw reform in terms of tidying up afterwards. His attitude was demonstrated in a Sunday evening radio broadcast on 26 March 1944. He was obliged to devote most of it to the subject of reform and showed a distinct lack of interest. In their respective diaries, Colville said Churchill had broadcast \\"indifferently\\" and Harold Nicolson said that, to many people, Churchill came across the air as \\"a worn and petulant old man\\". In the end, however, it was the population's demand for reform that decided the 1945 general election. Labour was perceived as the party that would deliver Beveridge. Arthur Greenwood had initiated its preceding social insurance and allied services inquiry in June 1941. Attlee, Bevin and Labour's other coalition ministers through the war were seen to be working towards reform and earned the trust of the electorate. =Defeat of Germany: June 1944 to May 1945= Normandy, 1944. D-Day: Allied invasion of Normandy Churchill was determined to be actively involved in the Normandy invasion and hoped to cross the Channel on D-Day itself (6 June 1944) or at least on D-Day+1. His desire caused unnecessary consternation at SHAEF until he was effectively vetoed by the King who told Churchill that, as head of all three services, he (the King) ought to go too. Churchill expected an Allied death toll of 20,000 on D-Day but he was proved to be pessimistic because less than 8,000 died in the whole of June. He made his first visit to Normandy on 12 June to visit Montgomery, whose HQ was then about five miles inland. That evening, as he was returning to London, the first V-1 flying bombs were launched. In a longer visit to Normandy on 22‚Äì23 July, Churchill went to Cherbourg and Arromanches where he saw the Mulberry Harbour. Quebec Conference, September 1944 Churchill met Roosevelt at the Second Quebec Conference (codename Octagon) from 12 to 16 September 1944. Between themselves, they reached agreement on the Morgenthau Plan for the Allied occupation of Germany after the war, the intention of which was not only to demilitarise but also de-industrialise Germany. Eden strongly opposed it and was later able to persuade Churchill to disown it. US Secretary of State Cordell Hull also opposed it and convinced Roosevelt that it was infeasible. Moscow Conference, October 1944 At the fourth Moscow conference (codename Tolstoy) from 9 to 19 October 1944, Churchill and Eden met Stalin and Molotov. This conference has gained notoriety for the so-called \\"Percentages agreement\\" in which Churchill and Stalin effectively agreed the post-war fate of the Balkans. By that time, the Soviet armies were in Rumania and Bulgaria. Churchill suggested a scale of predominance throughout the whole region so as not to, as he put it, \\"get at cross-purposes in small ways\\". He wrote down some suggested percentages of influence per country and gave it to Stalin who ticked it. The agreement was that Russia would have 90% control of Romania and 75% control of Bulgaria. The UK and the USA would have 90% control of Greece. Hungary and Yugoslavia would be 50% each. In 1958, five years after the account of this meeting was published (in Churchill's The Second World War), Soviet authorities denied that Stalin had accepted such an \\"imperialist proposal\\". Yalta Conference, February 1945 Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin at the Yalta Conference, February 1945. From 30 January to 2 February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt met for their Malta Conference ahead of the second \\"Big Three\\" event at Yalta from 4 to 11 February. Yalta had massive implications for the post-war world. There were two predominant issues: the question of setting up the United Nations Organisation after the war, on which much progress was made; and the more vexed question of Poland's post-war status, which Churchill saw as a test case for the future of Eastern Europe. Churchill faced some strong criticism for the Yalta agreement on Poland. For example, 27 Tory MPs voted against him when the matter was debated in the Commons at the end of the month. Jenkins, however, maintains that Churchill did as well as he could have done in very difficult circumstances, not least the fact that Roosevelt was seriously ill and could not provide Churchill with meaningful support. Another outcome of Yalta was the so-called Operation Keelhaul. The Western Allies agreed to the forcible repatriation of all Soviet citizens in the Allied zones, including prisoners of war, to the Soviet Union and the policy was later extended to all Eastern European refugees, many of whom were anti-Communist. Keelhaul was implemented between 14 August 1946 and 9 May 1947. Dresden bombings controversy The destruction of Dresden, February 1945. Churchill's crossing of the Rhine river in Germany, during Operation Plunder on 25 March 1945. On the nights of 13‚Äì15 February 1945, some 1,200 British and US bombers attacked the German city of Dresden, which was crowded with wounded and refugees from the Eastern Front. The attacks were part of an area bombing campaign that was initiated by Churchill in January with the intention of shortening the war. Churchill came to regret the bombing because initial reports suggested an excessive number of civilian casualties close to the end of the war, though an independent commission in 2010 confirmed a death toll between 22,700 and 25,000. On 28 March, he decided to restrict area bombing and sent a memorandum to General Ismay for the Chiefs of Staff Committee: British historian Frederick Taylor has pointed out that the number of Soviet citizens who died from German bombing was roughly equivalent to the number of German citizens who died from Allied raids. Jenkins asks if Churchill was moved more by foreboding than by regret but admits it is easy to criticise with the hindsight of victory. He adds that the area bombing campaign was no more reprehensible than President Truman's use of the second atomic bomb on Nagasaki six months later. Andrew Marr, quoting Max Hastings, says that Churchill's memorandum was a \\"calculated political attempt..... to distance himself..... from the rising controversy surrounding the area offensive\\". VE Day and after Churchill waving the Victory sign to the crowd in Whitehall on the day he broadcast to the nation that the war with Germany had been won, 8 May 1945. Ernest Bevin stands to his right. On 7 May 1945 at the SHAEF headquarters in Reims the Allies accepted Germany's surrender. The next day was Victory in Europe Day (VE Day) when Churchill broadcast to the nation that Germany had surrendered and that a final ceasefire on all fronts in Europe would come into effect at one minute past midnight that night (i.e., on the 9th). Afterwards, Churchill went to Buckingham Palace where he appeared on the balcony with the Royal Family before a huge crowd of celebrating citizens. He went from the palace to Whitehall where he addressed another large crowd: At this point he asked Ernest Bevin to come forward and share the applause. Bevin said: \\"No, Winston, this is your day\\", and proceeded to conduct the people in the singing of For He's a Jolly Good Fellow. In the evening, Churchill made another broadcast to the nation asserting that the defeat of Japan would follow in the coming months (the Japanese surrendered on 15 August 1945). With a general election looming (there had been none for almost a decade), and with the Labour ministers refusing to continue the wartime coalition, Churchill resigned as prime minister on 23 May 1945. Later that day, he accepted the King's invitation to form a new government, known officially as the National Government, like the Conservative-dominated coalition of the 1930s, but in practice known as the Churchill caretaker ministry. Polling day was 5 July, but the results of the 1945 election did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas. The result was a landslide victory for Labour so Churchill resigned as prime minister and was succeeded by Clement Attlee. Churchill had been unopposed by the major parties in Woodford, his new constituency in Essex, but his majority over a sole independent candidate was much less than expected. On hearing the Woodford result, he gloomily anticipated national defeat by Labour and, when Clementine suggested that it might be \\"a blessing in disguise\\", he retorted that \\"at the moment it seems very effectively disguised\\".
