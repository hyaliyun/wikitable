As with any other form of tachycardia (rapid heart beat), the underlying mechanism can be either the rapid discharge of an abnormal focus, the presence of a ring of cardiac tissue that gives rise to a circle movement (reentry),Curr Opin Cardiol. 2001 Jan;16(1):1‚Äì7. \\"Basic mechanisms of reentrant arrhythmias\\".

Classification Forms of atrial tachycardia (ATach) include multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), focal atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter.50px Text was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Epidemiology A European study of young males applying for pilot licenses demonstrated that 0.34% had symptomatic atrial tachycardia and 0.46% had symptomatic atrial tachycardia. Etiology Atrial tachycardia tends to occur in individuals with structural heart disease, with or without heart failure, and ischemic coronary artery disease. However, focal atrial tachycardia often occurs in healthy individuals without structural heart disease. Other possible etiologies are listed below: *Hypoxia *Pulmonary disease *Ischemic heart disease *Stimulants: cocaine, caffeine, chocolate, ephedra *Alcohol *Metabolic disturbances *Digoxin toxicity *Heightened sympathetic tone A study noted 10 to 15% of patients presenting for supraventricular tachycardia ablation had atrial tachycardia. Diagnosis Electrocardiographic features include: *Atrial rate: 100 to 250 BPM *Ventricular conduction can be variable **Irregular or irregularly irregular in the setting of variable AV block **Regular if 1 to 1, 2 to 1, or 4 to 1 AV block *P wave morphology **Unifocal, but similar in morphology to each other **Might be inverted **Differs from normal sinus P wave *May exhibit either long RP or short PR intervals *Rhythm may be paroxysmal or sustained **May demonstrate an increase in the rate at initiation (i.e., ‚Äúwarm up,‚Äù or ‚Äúrev up‚Äù) **May demonstrate a decrease in the rate at termination (i.e., ‚Äúcool down‚Äù) Treatment Initial management of focal atrial tachycardia should focus on addressing underlying causes: treating acute illness, cessation of stimulants, stress reduction, appropriately managing digoxin toxicity, or chronic disease management. The ventricular rate is controllable with the use of beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. If atrial tachyarrhythmia persists and the patient is symptomatic, the patient may benefit from class IA, IC, or class III antiarrhythmics. Catheter ablation of focal atrial tachycardia may be appropriate in patients failing medical therapy.

Carl Kotchian, Lockheed Executive, Dies at 94\\". The New York Times. Accessed December 23, 2008. Kotchian, a Certified Public Accountant, worked for Price Waterhouse in Los Angeles. He was hired in 1941 by Vega Airplane Company, a subsidiary of Lockheed Aircraft. At Lockheed, he supervised the firm's surge in aircraft production during World War II. He established the firm's manufacturing site in Marietta, Georgia, which became the primary production location for the C-130 Hercules cargo plane and later for the F-22 Raptor fighter. He became president of Lockheed in 1967, a period in which the firm produced the C-5 Galaxy cargo plane and the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane for the U.S. military and the L-1011 TriStar jet for the commercial market. Development of the L-1011 began in the late 1960s, during Kotchian's presidency, and was started without any firm orders. In 1971, the United States government provided a $250 million loan to help bail the firm out of mounting development costs for military programs and for the L-1011. In testimony before the United States Senate in 1976, Kotchian described how he had met with government officials in Japan and made a payoff of 500 million yen, the equivalent of US$1.7 million, part of a total of US$12 million in payments to Japanese politicians and businessmen that led to the sale of 21 L-1011 aircraft by Lockheed, then worth US$430 million. Prime Minister of Japan Kakuei Tanaka was ultimately convicted of accepting a bribe, one of many notable Japanese politicians who were involved in the scandal. In his Senate testimony, Kotchian disclosed that Lockheed paid $1.1 million in the early 1960s to a Dutch official later identified as Prince Bernhard, husband of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands in his role as inspector general of the Military of the Netherlands. After the revelations, the prince stepped down from his military position.

Biography According to Zacharias of Mytilene, Sunicas was a Hun who fled to the Byzantine Empire, where he was baptized. By 527, he was an officer stationed at the fortress of Dara in Mesopotamia along with Simmas, and defended it against Sassanid Persian attacks... In 530, he appears as a dux, although it is not clear whether he held the territorial command of dux Mesopotamiae or if he just received the title. In this capacity, he participated at the great Byzantine victory in the Battle of Dara in June 530, where, along with Aigan, he commanded a 600-strong unit of Hun cavalry stationed on the Byzantine left flank. During the battle, Sunicas's Huns repelled the Persian attack on the Byzantine left and were then sent by Belisarius, the Byzantine commander, to reinforce the threatened right flank. There, Sunicas killed the Persian second-in-command, Baresmanes, as well as his standard-bearer, and the Sassanid Persians began to fall back in panic, cementing the Byzantine victory.. In the next year, he served again under Belisarius in his new campaign against Sassanid Persia. On his own initiative, he led a force into the Persian rear, where he caught many Persians and their Arab allies out foraging. He killed some of them and captured others for interrogation. However, as he had acted without orders, Belisarius severely reprimanded him, and only through the mediation of Belisarius's co-commander Hermogenes were the two reconciled. At the Battle of Callinicum (April 19, 531), Sunicas and Simmas were placed in command of the Byzantine left. Although they repelled the successive Persian attacks, the remainder of the army was defeated and forced to withdraw. Sunicas and his men, mostly infantry, nevertheless continued to fight, preventing the Sassanid Persians from pursuing the defeated Byzantines.. Nothing is known of him thereafter.

This prize is awarded annually to an individual or collaborative team making a significant contemporary contribution to the theoretical foundations of human cognition. Research interests Goldin-Meadow's experience at the Piagetian Institute in Geneva piqued her interest in the relation between language and thought. This interest continues to energize her research, which exploits the gestures that we produce with our hands to explore two fundamental questions. # Which properties of language are so fundamental to human language that they will appear in a communication system developed by a child who does not have access to linguistic input? Goldin-Meadow studies this question by observing the home-made gestures, called homesigns, that profoundly deaf children create when they are not exposed to sign language. Homesign offers insight into the linguistic properties that are at the core of human language‚Äì‚Äìproperties that children are able to invent on their own, and that conventional sign languages are likely to have contained at the earliest stages of their creation. # Can the gestures that hearing speakers produce when they talk play a role in learning, in particular, in the transition from an understanding that is grounded in movements in space to an understanding that is abstract and generalizable? The gestures that hearing speakers produce when they talk are robust‚Äì‚Äìthey appear in congenitally blind individuals, even when they talk to other blind individuals and even though they have never seen anyone gesture, and in deaf children who use sign language as their primary language. These co-speech gestures reflect a speaker's thoughts, often thoughts that don't appear in the speaker's language (either sign or speech) and that the speaker doesn't even know she has. But gesture can do more than reflect thought‚Äì‚Äìit can play a role in changing thought, as part of the language learning process and, once language has been mastered, as part of the learning process that leads to the acquisition of other skills.

The city had been declared a Festung (fortress) by Hitler, to be held to the last man. Fought from 10 to 12 September 1944, the Allied objective was to secure the harbour facilities intact, to deliver supplies to the Allied armies in Continental Europe. The Allies refused to let the civilian population be evacuated, despite offers of free passage by the fortress commander. From 26 August, Royal Navy ships and Royal Air Force aircraft carried out a blockade and an extensive preparatory bombardment of the city, which killed over 2,000 civilians and 19 German troops. The land attack was carried out by British infantry, aided by specialist armoured vehicles from the 79th Armoured Division, including Canadian troops. The German garrison of about 11,000 men surrendered on 12 September; the port was badly damaged but it was re-opened on 9 October. BackgroundInvasion of Normandy= On D-Day, 6 June 1944, Allied troops landed in Normandy on the north coast of France in Operation Overlord and began the liberation of France. On D-Day, Allied aircraft laid a smoke screen off Le Havre to blind the coastal artillery; a torpedo-boat flotilla and a flotilla of patrol ships sailed from the port, using the smoke for camouflage. The German boats managed to fire 15 torpedoes off the Orne at 05:30, hit and sink and forced several other ships to take evasive action. On 6 July, Allied ships reported an \\"unusual object\\" passing through the Trout line, the eastern flank of the invasion area. The object was fired on, launched a torpedo and sailed away. Several more objects appeared soon after, well dispersed and were also fired on. The devices managed to sink two minesweepers for a loss of nine sunk and fifteen losses from all causes of the 26 that had sailed from Le Havre; it was later found that they were Neger midget submarines of the K-Verband (Small Battle Units). On the night of 21 Neger left Le Havre and all were sunk, most of their operators being killed, for one British minesweeper sunk and the Polish cruiser ORP Dragon damaged and scuttled off Sword Beach. =June‚ÄìAugust= RAF Bomber Command attacked Le Havre in the evening 14 June, twenty-two 617 Squadron Lancaster bombers and Mosquito target markers going first, to drop Tallboy bombs on the E-boat (Schnellboot, S-Boot [fast boat]) pens and one Tallboy penetrated the roof, which did much to eliminate the E-boat threat. The Dambusters were followed by 228 more Lancasters and three hours later a second wave of 116 aircraft arrived, of bombs hitting the port and anti-aircraft gun positions. The operation was the largest day raid by Bomber Command since the war began. By coincidence, the anti-aircraft guns at Le Havre had been prohibited from firing, to protect Luftwaffe aircraft in the area and the bombers killed about 1,000 marines, demoralised the survivors and destroyed about of shipping, comprising 9 E-boats of the 5th and 9th flotillas which were sunk, two seriously damaged one and slightly damaged, three of the five torpedo boats (similar to destroyers) in port were sunk, along with twenty minesweepers and patrol boats and nineteen tugs; several auxiliary vessels were sunk and eight other vessels were damaged. Admiral Theodor Krancke, then Chief of Kriegsmarine Group Command West, called the raid a catastrophe and in the war diary wrote \\"It will be hardly possible to carry out the operations planned...since yesterday's attack on Le Havre\\". Some E-boats reached Le Havre in mid-June but by the end of July, only six E-boats on the channel coast were operational. The Navy formed the Support Squadron Eastern Flank, a group of small gun-armed vessels, which came inshore during the day to bombard land targets and patrolled offshore at night. The squadron fought many engagements with E-boats and K-Verband; on the night of the Germans sent twenty Linsen (explosive motor boat) sorties, over fifty Marder (midget submarines) and several E-boat attacks with new Dackel TIIId circling torpedoes; most of the German craft were sunk. The night sorties by E-boats transferred to Le Havre after D-Day sank a Motor Torpedo Boat, two Landing Ship, Tank, three merchant ships, two landing craft and two tugs; six E-boats were sunk and ten damaged in the exchanges. =Festung Le Havre= Le Havre was the most important of the Channel Ports and second only to Marseilles amongst French ports for tonnage capacity, having of quays capable of receiving ocean-going ships. In Operation Maple from early April, British aircraft and ships laid mines off Le Havre and the ports further north, which closed the port for long periods. In early September 1944, German troops of the 15th Army (General Gustav-Adolf von Zangen) occupied a swathe of coastal territory from the port to Bruges, which had been under attack by the First Canadian Army since the start of September. The port had water on three sides, the Channel to the west, the valley of the L√©zarde River to the east and to the south by the estuary of the Seine estuary the Canal de Tancarville. North of Le Havre, the ground rises steeply to high ground as far as the cliffs of Cap de la H√®ve and the coast to the north. The L√©zarde and Fontaine river valleys cut the area into two plateaux, the north plateau being between the rivers and the south plateau to the south and west of the Fontaine, which overlooks the port; inland the south plateau is covered by the F√¥ret de Montgeon. The Germans had dug an anti-tank ditch from the L√©zarde valley past Montivilliers to the coast at Octeville-sur-Mer, covered by minefields, barbed wire and concrete defensive positions. At the crest of the southern plateau, two fortified positions covered the town and port entrance and the Grand Clos coastal artillery battery could engage approaching ships. The garrison had 115 guns, plenty of machine-guns and mortars (many of its anti-tank guns were sent to Normandy before September and lost) ammunition and supplies for 14,000 men for ninety days. Near Fontaine La Mallet lay Strongpoint 8, with several concrete gun emplacements, the first of a series to cover the northern approaches to the port. The minefields and tank obstacles had been hurriedly built and were superimposed on an earlier and unfinished scheme based on strongpoints. West of Strongpoint 8 the ground is unsuitable for tanks but from the strongpoint to the L√©zarde the ground is flat and unobstructed, with a gentle -slope on either side, the plateaux on both sides being at the same height as the strongpoint, which commanded the stream The anti-tank ditch was V-shaped, wide at the top and more than deep but not continuous. =Crossing the Seine= Allied invasion plans required that the First Canadian Army (General Harry Crerar) on the left flank of the 21st Army Group (General Bernard Montgomery) should cross the Seine downstream of Rouen and turn left into the Le Havre peninsula and make right-handed flanking manoeuvres to capture Le Havre and its railway connexions, Dieppe, Calais and Dunkirk, for the Allied supply effort. On the night of 26/27 August, the crossing of the Seine by the First Canadian Army began and Rouen was captured on 30 August, I Corps used every means it could improvise to get over the lower Seine which was not bridged and II Canadian Corps further upriver. The two corps were ordered to capture Le Havre and Dieppe respectively and then clear the coastal belt up to Bruges. The German 7th Army was ordered to abandon the lower Seine and by 31 August, the 15th Army to hold a line from Dieppe to Neufch√¢tel but the speed of the Allied advance forced a retreat to the Somme. In Operation Fusillade, Dieppe was entered unopposed by the 2nd Canadian Division on 1 September and the 51st Highland Infantry Division walked into St-Valery, four years after most of the original Highland division had been forced to surrender there. The Highlanders joined the 49th (West Riding) Division outside Le Havre on 4 September. As the Canadian Army prepared its attack on Le Havre, the seaward approaches were blockaded closely by the Allies navies from 26 August; the port was the most westerly still in German possession and the Kriegsmarine tried to run supplies in and get out the ships still afloat. During the next four nights convoys departing Le Havre were attacked and a few ships managed to slip away; nine ships were sunk and by 30 August the port was empty. PreludeGerman defences= On 14 August 1944, Colonel Hermann-Eberhard Wildermuth took command of the fortress and later put the effective strength of the garrison at around 8,000 men, from a total of more than 11,000 personnel. Wildermuth had a Festungs Stamm Abteilung (fortress cadre unit) elements of the 226th Infantry Division and 245th Infantry Division; a battalion of Security Regiment 5, marines and some naval personnel. About 50,000 French civilians remained in the port from the normal population of about 160,000 people. On 9 September, Wildermuth ordered that infantry attacks were to be resisted, even with pistols but when tanks attacked, strongpoints which had no anti-tank guns could surrender; rather than fight to the last man, the garrison was to resist until the last anti- tank gun. Before the attack, the defenders were given an ultimatum and called upon to surrender; Wildermuth countered by requesting that civilians should be evacuated, given that his orders from Hitler were to hold Festung Le Havre to the last man. Wildermuth appealed to British humanity and repeated his offer, even after the bombing campaign started but was again refused. Crocker judged that the proposed two-day truce to get the civilians out, would take too long and delay the capture of the port. =Allied preparations= A naval and air bombardment was planned to soften up the Le Havre fortifications. The battleship and the monitor , bombarded the port with more than of shells over several days. On 5 September, Erebus was forced temporarily out of action by a hit from the Grand Clos battery, which had one and two guns; the port defences also had 44 medium and field guns and 32 anti-aircraft guns. The Bomber Command day attack on 5 September was the first of seven raids. On the night of a similar number of aircraft attacked and another day raid was flown on 8 September by 109 aircraft; a raid on 9 September had to be cancelled because of bad weather but the raids flown delivered about of bombs. On 10 September, about sixty bombers attacked the Grand Clos battery, followed by a bombardment from Warspite' and Erebus, which put the German guns out of action. Bomber Command returned in the afternoon and dropped another of bombs as the British divisional artillery and the 4th and 9th Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) conducted counter-flak bombardments during the raids. Before the ground attack, the RAF flew 1,863 Lancaster and Halifax heavy bomber sorties and dropped over of bombs. The air and naval bombardments killed About 2,000 French civilians and 19 Germans. =Allied plan= During the North-west Europe Campaign (6 June 1944 ‚Äì 8 May 1945), British specialist tanks were held in the 79th Armoured Division (Major-General Percy Hobart) and attached to other units for particular operations. For Astonia, the 79th Armoured Division provided the 49th Division with the 222nd Assault Squadron RE (AVRE), two Crab squadrons of the 22nd Dragoons and a Crocodile squadron of the 141st Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (141 RAC). The division also had the 34th Armoured Brigade and the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment with 44 Kangaroos under command. In the I Corps plan, phase I had the 49th Division breaking through on the northern front capture strongpoints to the south and cross the Fontaine. In phase IIa the Highlanders would break through on the right and in IIb the 49th Division was to capture the southern plateau. In phase II the Highlanders would take the ground around Octeville and the heights north of Le Havre and in phase IV, all forces were ruthlessly to exploit opportunities to capture the town. Assault10 September= East of Strongpoint 8 the ditch was near the top of the slope down to the stream, with the minefield in front. The 56th Infantry Brigade (Brigadier M. S. Ekin) was to conduct the attack on the 49th Division front.The attack plan was to penetrate the German defences to allow further forces to attack, then further these gains and capture the city. An assault of two divisions began at 17:45 hours on 10 September, with naval bombardment vessels engaging the coastal batteries defending the port and RAF bombers dropping an additional of bombs ninety minutes before zero hour. With the assistance of specialist units from the 79th Armoured Division and the 1st Canadian Armoured Carrier Regiment, such as Kangaroos and Sherman Crab vehicles, the first part of the assault proceeded swiftly, with gaps cleared through the minefield and anti-tank ditches breached. The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division penetrated the north- eastern section of the Le Havre perimeter first, followed by the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division attacking on their right from the north. The assault was costly for the specialised armour, the heavy rains making river banks much soggier than the plateaux, slowing flails and other vehicles at their most vulnerable. 79th Armoured Division losing 34 Crab anti-mine flail tanks, two command tanks and 6 Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers (AVRE) vehicles. =11‚Äì12 September= On the second day, the attack continued with support from Hawker Typhoons and armoured vehicles; facing the threat of Churchill Crocodile flame throwing tanks, the last outer defence strongpoints surrendered at 14:00 hours. On the third day of the assault the town centre was cleared by the infantry of both divisions, forcing the German garrison commander's official surrender at 11:45, 12 September; 11,300 German troops were captured and interned as prisoners of war. AftermathAnalysis= Despite the weather, the bombing greatly hampered the defence of the port and the final attack just before the ground operation began on 10 September, prompted by the experience of Operation Charnwood, caused much disorganisation among the defenders. The operation was a model combined operation in which the British advantage in set-piece attacks backed by massed firepower was efficiently exploited. Much emphasis had been placed on maintaining the momentum of the attack and good timing, the usual caution in attack being relaxed to exploit any sign that the defenders were collapsing. While there had been few Allied casualties during the operation, damage to the port infrastructure was severe, of docks and 15,000 buildings had been destroyed but the port was open again by 9 October. Wildermuth claimed that the lack of anti-tank guns had prevented a long defence of the port but other prisoners said that even the experience of Russia was less of an ordeal than the bombing. Because of the scandal of friendly civilian casualties, Allied forces besieging Calais allowed the civilians to be evacuated before it was attacked; Dunkirk was masked until Germany surrendered on 8 May 1945. =Casualties= In the British official history, Lionel Ellis recorded the capture of 11,300 German prisoners for fewer than 500 Allied casualties. In 1960, Charles Stacey, the Canadian official historian, gave 11,302 prisoners and 388 casualties in I Corps. In 2014, John Plant wrote that the 22nd Dragoons lost 29 of its 33 flail tanks and two command tanks, the 222nd Assault Squadron lost five AVRE and that six tanks were lost by the 7th RTR but that most of the damage had been caused by mines and was repairable, only eleven of the 22nd Dragoon losses being write-offs. About 2,000 French civilians and 19 Germans were killed in the air and naval bombardments.

Traditionally, they are attached to the Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance companies to help support the Command Element of the Marine Air-Ground Task Force in special reconnaissance missions. Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsman SARCs are trained and specialized in the same aspects of their Recon Marine and special operator counterparts: amphibious entry, deep recon and direct action. They are also capable of conducting detailed underwater ship-bottom searches. During operational status, the teams will then be dispersed evenly throughout the Marine recon platoons; usually one amphibious recon corpsman per platoon. SARCs have regularly acted as a point man, sharp shooter, radio operator, or even the team leader in the Marine recon teams/platoons. More recently, SARCs are being deployed with Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) and select Naval Special Warfare units such as DEVGRU due to their highly advanced skills in combat trauma care and diving medicine. Mission The environments that Recon Marines and Recon Corpsmen face during a mission are usually hazardous. The Special Amphibious Reconnaissance Corpsmen use their paramedic skills to provide advanced medical support and other emergency medical procedures related to the hazards of swimming, open and closed circuit SCUBA diving, and military freefall during amphibious reconnaissance operations. They also instruct and advise the recon Marines in the prevention and treatment of illnesses, whether in combat or training. The SARC has the duty of hyperbaric chamber operator: skilled in the operation of recompression chambers for hyperbaric treatment. They are also required to know laws and physics of diving, fundamentals of proper gas mixtures, theory and practice of decompression and the use of decompression tables. * Performs routine sick call, diagnostic patient care as well as associated operational, administrative, and logistical duties. * Performs basic anesthesia, minor surgical, basic clinical laboratory, basic radiology, and other routine and emergency health care procedures as required. * Performs advanced trauma procedures in a hostile or combat environment often independently behind enemy lines. * Instructs and advises junior medical and operational personnel in prevention and treatment of illness and injuries. * Recognizes all types of illnesses associated with diving to include oxygen toxicity and hypercapnia, nitrogen narcosis, type I and II decompression sickness and air/gas embolism. Screening and training As of 2015, a male hospital corpsman serving in the paygrades of E-1 (hospitalman recruit) to E-6 (hospital corpsman first class) serving in any capacity may apply for candidacy.

This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. The team's first-choice wicket-keeper ahead of Ron Saggers, Tallon played in four of the five Tests, missing the Fourth Test due to injury. Despite being the preferred gloveman, Tallon conceded byes at a higher rate than Saggers during the tour. Bradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 first-class matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval was described as Wisden as the best of the year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia recover to a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests. In recognition of his performances, Tallon was named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1949. Background Tallon's form as Australia's wicket-keeper since World War II saw him selected for the 1948 Ashes tour as part of the side that would become known to cricket history as the Invincibles. Tallon was the first-choice wicket-keeper, with Saggers as his deputy.Pollard, p. 6. Having spent the majority of his life in sunny Queensland and growing up in tropical Bundaberg, the cold English climate initially caught Tallon off guard. He did not wet his inner gloves as was his custom due to the temperature.Perry (2001), p. 196. As England agreed to make a new ball available every 55 overs, this meant that the ball would more frequently be in a favourable state for fast bowling, since it would swing more.Perry (2001), p. 197. As a result, Australia adopted a pace-oriented strategy and Ian Johnson was the only spinner regularly used in the Test matches. Colin McCool was not to play a Test on the tour, depriving Tallon of an opportunity to show his stumping abilities standing up at the stumps to his Queensland team-mate in the Tests.Perry (2001), pp. 197‚Äì198. Early tour Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Accordingly, Tallon was selected as the wicket-keeper for the match. The home side batted first and Tallon made his first dismissal on English soil by catching Worcestershire captain Allan White from the bowling of Keith Miller. He then stumped former England captain Bob Wyatt from McCool. In reply to the hosts' 233, Tallon was promoted to No. 6, but managed only six in a collapse of 4/38 before Australia recovered to declare at 8/462. He took a further three dismissals in the second innings, two of them stumpings from McCool's bowling, as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs. Tallon conceded 11 byes in the match. Tallon was rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings with Saggers behind the stumps. Tallon played a key role in Australia's victory in the next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling.Fingleton, pp. 53‚Äì55. He came in at 7/86 and made ten in the first innings to push Australia to 101 in reply to Yorkshire's 71, in which Tallon did not concede a bye. However, Tallon was not so tidy in the second innings, conceding 11 byes as the hosts were bowled out for 89 in their second innings. He did not make a dismissal in the match. Australia then collapsed to 6/31 in pursuit of 60 for victory when Tallon strode in. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia only had three wickets in hand. Australia faced its first loss to an English county since 1912.Fingleton, p. 55. He survived an immediate leg before wicket appeal and then hit a shot that fell just short of a fielder. He then compiled 17 unbeaten runs as Australia scraped home by four wickets.Fingleton, p. 56. The Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval. Tallon came in with the score at 6/553, and held up his end, scoring an unbeaten 50 as his partners steadily fell and Australia were bowled out at 632. Tallon had some difficulty in English conditions as he sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the match and was hit as he put hand over his face for protection, with the ball running away for four byes. Tallon took two catches in the second innings as Australia won the match by an innings, but he also conceded 24 byes in Surrey's match total of 336. After sustaining the bruised finger, Tallon was rested for the following three matches, which were against Cambridge University, Essex and Oxford. Australia won each of the matches by an innings. Saggers filled in and scored 110 runs including a 104 not out against Essex and took five dismissals. Saggers conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches, while Tallon had conceded 46 in three.N- Ron Saggers (centre) pictured with Stan McCabe (left) and Tallon (right) during a country match in 1945. The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, and Tallon was selected despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the preceding tour matches. He made 11 batting at No. 9, including a six from Jim Laker as Australia made 552.Fingleton, p. 73. He took three catches in the first innings, having a hand in the first three wickets to fall, Jack Robertson, Bill Edrich and Denis Compton. He then took two stumpings in the second innings as the follow on was enforced, but also conceded 26 byes as Australia won by an innings. Tallon had conceded 72 byes to Saggers' 34 with both having played four matches.N- Following the match against the MCC, there were four more county fixtures before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew the first two before winning the latter two by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Tallon played in only the Nottinghamshire match, taking two catches in the first innings and two stumpings in each of the innings. The catches were all from Lindwall and the stumpings from Doug Ring. Tallon conceded 18 byes for the match and scored 27, being last man out at 400 after coming to the crease at 6/355. In Saggers's three matches, 36 byes were conceded and six dismissals were made. First Test Despite averaging more byes per innings than Saggers during the warm-up matches,N- Tallon was retained in the Test team. During the First Test at Trent Bridge, Tallon took four catches. In the first innings, Tallon caught Jim Laker from the bowling of Keith Miller to end England's innings of 165 after he and Alec Bedser had joined forces at 8/74. When Australia batted, Tallon came in at 6/338 to accompany Lindsay Hassett and took 39 minutes to compile 10 before hitting a return catch to the left arm orthodox spin of Jack Young. The scoring was slow during this passage of play‚ÄîYoung delivered 11 consecutive maiden overs and his 26-over spell conceded only 14 runs with Australia using leg theory. After Australia ended with 509 and took a 334-run lead, Tallon took two difficult catches to dismiss key batsmen at the start of England's second innings. Miller removed Cyril Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot to Tallon.Fingleton, p. 96. Bill Edrich was then caught behind attempting a cut from the off spin of Johnson. He did not read the arm ball that went straight on and the ball took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39.Fingleton, p. 97. He thus helped Australia to seize the initiative by denying England a good start, but they recovered. Later, he caught Godfrey Evans for 50 from Johnson as England ended at 441. Australia reached their target of 98 with two wickets down, completing an eight-wicket victory.Perry, p. 199. Tallon conceded five and 12 byes in the two innings respectively. Between Tests, Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire, and Tallon was rested for both matches. The first was won by an innings and second was drawn. Saggers made four and 22 and conceded 24 byes in four innings. Second Test The teams moved on to Lord's for the Second Test and Australia compiled 350 in its first innings. Tallon came to the crease with Australia at 6/225 after Hassett and Bill Brown had gone in quick succession, joining Johnson in the middle. Johnson struggled to score, while Tallon did so freely in the last hour. After Johnson fell for four at 7/246, Lindwall then joined Tallon and the pair survived to the close of play. England were well placed when Australia ended at stumps on 7/258 with Tallon on 25. Tallon had dominated the scoring late in day, making 25 of the 33 runs added. The crowd was optimistic about England's position and some immediately camped outside the turnstiles upon leaving the ground.Fingleton, p. 175. Australia's lower order batted the tourists into control on the second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 8/275, Tallon kept on batting in a conventional manner, supported by Johnston and Ernie Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores.Cashman, pp. ??. Both tail-enders threw the bat at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Tallon put on 45 with Johnston‚Äîwho scored 29‚Äî before holing out for 53. Ending at 350, the Australians had regained the momentum, taking 92 runs from 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. Tallon did not concede a bye in England's first innings of 215 and his diving was estimated to have saved around 40 runs. He caught Washbrook from Lindwall to leave England at 1/17, and later caught Laker from Johnson. Tallon was not needed in the second innings; Lindwall was promoted above Tallon because Australia needed quick runs and Lindwall was a big-hitter. Australia declared at 7/460, leaving England a target of 509. With the score at 2/65, Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as \\"miraculous\\" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to take the catch. Another dive to stop a leg glance resulted in a severely bruised left little finger. Tallon conceded 16 byes in the second innings, more than 8% of England's score. Australia won the Test by 409 runs, and nursing his finger, Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests, which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire, which were won by ten wickets and an innings respectively. In his place, Saggers scored 12, took nine dismissals and conceded 31 byes in four innings. Third Test The teams then played out a rain-affected draw in the Third Test match at Manchester, where England elected to bat first. On the first day, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall delivery and was caught by Tallon for 32, leaving England at 5/119.Fingleton, p. 171. Compton returned at the fall of Edrich's wicket after previously leaving the ground after being bloodied in the head by a Lindwall bouncer. He batted to stumps, after being dropped one-handed on 50 by Tallon, before again being dropped on 64 late in the day by the gloveman from the bowling of Johnston.Fingleton, pp. 133‚Äì134. England closed at 7/231 with Compton on 64. On the second morning, Tallon again dropped Compton from Johnston when the batsman was on 73.Fingleton, p. 134. England eventually finished on 363, with Compton not out on 145. Thus Tallon's drops cost 95 runs as well as allowing Compton to hold up one end so his partners could score. Tallon also conceded seven byes. Australia reached 3/135 when Miller and Arthur Morris departed in quick succession. With Sid Barnes retiring hurt because of a blow to the ribs, Tallon came in at 5/139, effectively six wickets down and made 18 in half an hour before falling at 6/172. Australia managed to reach 221 and avoid the follow on. England batted again and Tallon dismissed George Emmett from Lindwall with a diving one-handed catch.Lemmon, p. 103. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who took it in his right hand with a dive, leaving England at 1/1.Fingleton, p. 141. England then declared at 3/174; Tallon conceded nine byes and with more than a day was lost to rain, Tallon was not required as Australia batted out the last session for a draw. Tallon's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during a tour match against Middlesex. In this match, he scored 17, took two catches and a stumping in the first innings and conceded only seven byes for the entire match as Australia won by ten wickets. Fourth Test The left finger injury ruled him out of the Fourth Test at Headingley, and he was replaced by Saggers. Australia set a world record in successfully chasing a target of 404 to win the match by seven wickets and secure the series. Saggers leaked only six byes in 299.1 overs of glovework during the match as Australia conceded a total of 861 runs for the match. It was the lowest percentage of byes conceded in a match total by an Australian wicket-keeper for the tour (0.697%).N- Tallon missed the innings victory over Derbyshire, before returning against Glamorgan. In his first match back from injury, Tallon took a catch and two stumpings as the hosts were dismissed for 197, but he also conceded 19 byes. Byes made 9.64% of the match total conceded by Australia, the highest proportion by the tourists during the summer.N- He did not bat as rain ended the match with Australia at 3/215. He was rested for the nine- wicket win over Warwickshire, before returning for Australia's second match and second draw against Lancashire. Tallon came in at 7/232 and scored 33, adding 63 with Ian Johnson to help Australia reach 321. He took two catches and two stumpings but also conceded 23 byes. In the non-first-class match against Durham, Tallon played purely as a batsman, while Saggers kept wicket. He opened the batting, but was dismissed for one as Australia made 273 and the hosts reached 5/73 before rain ended the match. Fifth Test Tallon returned for the Fifth Test at The Oval, where England elected to bat first on a rain- affected pitch. Tallon caught Jack Crapp from an outside edge for a duck from the bowling of Miller, leaving England at 4/23 as play was adjourned for lunch.Perry (2005), p. 250. England continued to struggle against the moving ball and were all out for 52 in the middle session. The innings ended when Tallon took an acrobatic catch to dismiss Len Hutton down the leg side, catching it with his left hand. It was considered the catch of the season by Wisden.Perry, p. 200. Tallon conceded six byes in the innings. Australia batted and passed England's total on the first afternoon. Tallon came in to bat on the second day with the score at 7/332, joining opener Morris, who had already passed 150. It took a run out to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run to third man after being called through by Tallon but was not quick enough for the substitute fielder's arm, leaving Australia at 8/359. Tallon, who scored 31, put on another 30 runs with Doug Ring, before both were out on 389, ending Australia's innings.Pollard, p. 17.Fingleton, p. 188. In the second innings, Tallon caught Hutton from Miller and conceded nine byes as England were dismissed for 188 and lost by an innings, sealing a 4‚Äì0 series victory for Australia. Later tour matches Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat. Tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against Kent, the Gentlemen of England, and Somerset, all of which Australia won by an innings. Saggers stood in and made seven dismissals and conceded 29 byes in the six innings of the three matches. He returned for the following match against the South of England. He did not bat as Australia declared at 7/522. He then took three catches and conceded 13 byes as the match was washed out when the hosts were dismissed for 298. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current England Test players be allowed to play for the hosts.Fingleton, pp. 207‚Äì209. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team,Perry (2005), pp. 253‚Äì254. with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Johnson coming for Doug Ring. Tallon made two as Australia declared at 8/489. He conceded seven byes and did not make a dismissal as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Tallon scored only six in Australia's 236 and then took 0/10 in Scotland's second innings and did not take a catch in the innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Tallon kept wicket, conceding 26 byes and not taking a dismissal and he was not required to bat. When the match became safe, with Australia in an unassailable position in Scotland's second innings, Bradman allowed Tallon to dispense with his wicket-keeping pads and try his luck at bowling leg spin.Perry, p. 201. Tallon never bowled in his Test career and only rarely in first-class cricket, where he delivered 301 balls, the approximate workload of a specialist bowler in one match. Tallon took 2/15 as Australia finished the tour with another innings win. Role A chart showing Tallon's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. Tallon had had moderate success with his batting during the Test series, aggregating 114 runs at 28.50. He usually batted at No. 8, and only had four innings as Australia's batting strength was such that he did not need to bat in the second innings in any of the Tests. The Australian team strategy of primarily depending on fast bowling saw Tallon make 12 catches and no stumpings during the Tests. However, Bradman gave his lead pace bowlers Miller and Lindwall more rest during the tour games to save energy for the Tests, and relied more heavily on the off spin of Ian Johnson and the leg spin of McCool and Doug Ring in the county matches. Thus overall Tallon took 29 catches and 14 stumpings for the first- class matches during the tour. Tallon scored 283 runs at 25.72 for the season at an average higher than Saggers's 23.22. In all his matches on tour, Tallon conceded 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs, a bye percentage of 4.67%, compared to Saggers's 221 byes from 6190 runs, a percentage of 3.57%.N- During the tour, Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 9,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes of Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable with the bat. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, including one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level.Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. As Australia often won by an innings, and often declared in the first innings, Tallon only had 13 innings in his 14 first-class fixtures and was not out two times as he ran out of partners. Tallon's performances during the English summer saw him named by Wisden as one of its five Cricketers of the Year.Perry, p. 202.

During the Iberian War against the Sassanid Empire, Sittas was given command of forces in Armenia, similar to the status of Belisarius in Mesopotamia. He won a victory over the Sassanids at the battle of Satala. Biography Sittas was the husband of Comito, the elder sister of the Empress Theodora, and possible father of the later empress Sophia.. Sittas's origin is obscure. Byzantinists have suggested his name was Gothic or Thracian, but his theoretical descent from either the Goths or the Thracians is not mentioned in primary sources. He enters history in the reign of Emperor Justin I (r. 518‚Äì527) as a doryphoros (\\"bodyguard\\") in the guard of Justinian, then magister militum per Orientem. Map of the Byzantine-Persian frontier In 527, Sittas and Belisarius were given command of an invasion of Persarmenia. They were successful in looting the area and capturing a significant number of Armenian prisoners. They attempted to invade the rest of the Marzpanate of Armenia later in the year but were defeated by Aratius and Narses. The latter should not be confused with Narses, another Byzantine general under Emperor Justinian. In 528, Sittas was appointed in the new office of magister militum per Armeniam. According to both Malalas and Theophanes the Confessor, Sittas recruited his scriniarii (administrative officials) among the local Armenian populace, as he considered them more familiar with the territory. Procopius records Sittas's victory over the Tzanni, a tribe of the Caucasus, which led occasional raids in neighbouring areas. Sittas successfully converted them from Paganism to Christianity and recruited the former brigands to the Byzantine army. In 530, Sittas also received the office of magister militum praesentalis (\\"Master of soldiers in the Presence [of the Emperor]\\"). That same year, Sittas and Dorotheus defended Theodosiopolis against an invading force from the Sassanid Empire, part of the ongoing Iberian War between Emperor Justinian and the Persian shah, Kavadh I (r. 488‚Äì531). Procopius notes that the Roman forces managed to pillage the enemy camp. Sittas also defended Satala against the invasion force by attacking the larger army at its rear and forcing them to retreat (Battle of Satala). The invasion was called off and the Sassanids retreated back to Persia following the two defeats. Following the defeat of Belisarius in the Battle of Callinicum (19 April 531), Sittas replaced him in the leadership of the forces in the east. During the Siege of Martyropolis (531), Sittas and Al- Harith ibn Jabalah camped at the nearby city of Amida, but avoided engagement as the Persians had the upper hand there. Kavadh, however, died within the year, and his son and successor Khosrau I (r. 531‚Äì579 AD) was interested in stabilizing his internal position for the time being and started negotiations for a peace. The \\"Eternal Peace\\" agreement (which eventually lasted ten years) was signed on September 532 on the terms of all Byzantine land lost under Emperor Justinian's rule to be returned, and the Byzantines to pay heavy tribute in exchange for peace. The country of Iberia remained under Sassanid control. Sittas received the honorific title of patrician in 535. The same year, Sittas is credited with a victory against the Bulgars in Moesia, by the Iatrus (Yantra). He was named an honorary consul in 536. In 538/539, Sittas was sent back to Armenia to face a revolt in protest against heavy taxation. Failing to negotiate peace, Sittas started active fighting. In the Battle of Oenochalcon, the nature of the terrain forced both armies to fight in scattered groups rather than in unified forces. Procopius records that Sittas was killed by either Artabanes, a leader of the revolt, or Solomon, an otherwise obscure rebel.

This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned Bradman's men the sobriquet The Invincibles. A left-arm medium-pace seam bowler, Toshack was a member of the first-choice team, and played in the first four Test matches before succumbing to a persistent knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen with leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall. He took 11 wickets in the Tests; his most notable performance was the 5/40 he took in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's.This notation (5/40) means that Toshack took five wickets and conceded 40 runs. However, his knee failed in the first innings of the Fourth Test when he took 1/112. He was unable to bowl in the second innings and missed the Fifth Test, marking the end of his Test career. For the entire tour, Toshack took 50 first-class wickets at a bowling average of 21.12 with four five-wicket innings hauls, including a best of 7/81 against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. He also took 6/51 in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club, who were almost entirely represented by English Test cricketers, playing a key part in an innings victory. With little batting ability, Toshack usually batted last in Australia's line-up and scored 78 runs at a batting average of 8.66, the worst first-class aggregate and average among the tourists. However, in the Tests, he was dismissed only once and averaged 51.00 with a series of tail-wagging performances, including his career best of 20 not out. Background A left-arm medium-pacer, Toshack made his first-class cricket debut in the 1945‚Äì46 upon the resumption of cricket after World War II. His performances were enough to ensure his selection for the tour of New Zealand in early 1946, where Toshack made his Test debut in the one-off match against the hosts' national team. From then on, Toshack was a regular member of the national team and played in every Test over the next two summers, fitness permitting. Toshack played in eight of the 11 Tests during this period, taking 36 wickets. Towards the end of the Test series against India in 1947‚Äì48 in Australia, knee injuries began to hamper Toshack, and he was in doubt for the 1948 tour of England. He only made the trip after a 3‚Äì2 majority vote by a medical panel, despite being one of the first players chosen by the selectors on cricketing merit. Two Melbourne doctors ruled him unfit, but three specialists from his home state of New South Wales presented a more optimistic outlook; this allowed him to tour.Pollard (1990), p. 6. As a member of Bradman's Invincibles, the tour was to immortalise him in cricketing history. He grew tired of signing autographs during the sea voyage to England, and entrusted a friend with the task. However, his friend was unaware of the correct spelling of his name; as a result, there are still sheets in circulation signed Toshak. The team manager Keith Johnson gave Toshack a talking to over this incident.Perry (2008), pp. 11‚Äì12. Early tour matches Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Toshack was included, reinforcing the new ball attack of Lindwall and Miller and the off spin and leg spin of Ian Johnson and Colin McCool respectively. Australia bowled first, and Toshack took two quick wickets to reduce the hosts to 3/158 after a 137-run second wicket partnership. Toshack ended with 2/39 as Australia dismissed Worcestershire for 233. He was not required to bat as Australia made 8/462 declared, and then took 1/40 in the second innings as the tourists started their campaign with an innings victory, setting the tone for the summer. Toshack was then rested for the second tour match against Leicestershire, which Australia won by an innings. He then missed the next match against Yorkshire, as Australia came closest to losing a match on the tour, scraping home by four wickets on a damp wicket.Fingleton, pp. 54‚Äì57. Toshack returned as the Australians travelled to London to play Surrey at The Oval, and he had his first outing with the bat on English soil, coming in last and scoring eight to help wicket-keeper Don Tallon add 33 for the final wicket before Australia were bowled out for 632. Toshack bowled without success in the first innings and took one wicket in the second innings, that of Arthur McIntyre, to end with match figures of 1/54 as Surrey were defeated by an innings. Toshack then took 2/32 in the first innings against Cambridge University, and did not bat as Australia declared at 4/414. He then took 0/9 from eight overs in the second innings, as Australia completed another innings victory. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia made 721 runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. However, Toshack only contributed four runs batting at No. 11. In the first innings, Toshack took the last five wickets to fall, including the top-scorer Ray Smith for 25, ending with 5/31 from 10.5 overs as the hosts capitulated for 83, unable to cope with his swing.Perry (2008), p. 64. Australia enforced the follow on and Toshack took a further 2/50 in the second innings as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, the largest margin of the tour. He then faced Oxford University, scoring two runs in Australia's 431. Toshack then took three lower order wickets in the first innings to end with 3/34 from 22 overs, sending down more overs than any other Australian. He took 3/37 in the second innings as Australia completed another innings victory after enforcing the follow on. The Oxford batsmen had trouble with the seam movement of Toshack.Perry (2008), p. 66. Toshack was retained for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were basically a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrich, three of England's first four batsmen in the Tests, all playing. Toshack was the last man in and made two, accompanying Lindwall in a 20-run final wicket stand as Australia totalled 552. After the MCC had reached 2/91, Toshack broke through the middle order. He had Compton caught behind by Don Tallon for 26, before trapping the incoming batsman Martin Donnelly‚Äîa New Zealand Test player‚Äîleg before wicket for five, and then having Hutton caught by vice-captain Lindsay Hassett for 52 a run later, leaving the hosts at 5/104. After the hosts recovered to 6/148, Toshack removed Test all rounder Ken Cranston, Test wicket-keeper Billy Griffith and spinner Jack Young to leave the MCC at 9/166. The MCC were eventually dismissed for 189, conceding a first innings lead of 363 runs. Toshack had taken 6/51 from 27 overs, and Bradman only allowed him four overs of rest. The Australian captain opted to enforce the follow on and allowed Toshack a lighter load in the second innings, bowling 15 overs and taking 1/43. He removed Edrich as the MCC fell for 205 in 60.2 overs to lose by an innings and 158 runs. Toshack had sent down the most overs by any Australian bowler in both innings. Bradman regarded Toshack's first innings performance as his best of the tour. Toshack again focused on the leg stump, which some English observers decried as being negative.Fingleton, p. 74. However, former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that Toshack's line was close enough to leg stump that most balls had to be played. In the next match against Lancashire, Toshack made four in Australia's 204, before claiming both openers after they had put on 48, including Test batsman Cyril Washbrook. Toshack ended with 2/40 as the match ended in a draw after the first day was washed out. It was Australia's first non-victory of the tour. After six consecutive matches in the space of 21 days, Toshack was rested for the next two matches against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge and Hampshire; the matches ended in a draw and an eight-wicket Australian win respectively. Toshack returned for the final county match against Sussex before the First Test. He did not take a wicket but pinned down the local batsmen as Lindwall blasted them out with match figures of 11/59. Eight of Lindwall's victims had their stumps knocked over. Toshack bowled 15 overs for 23 runs in the first innings as the hosts were skittled for 86. He did not bat as Australia made 5/549 and then returned in the second innings for 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots for a total of six runs. He finished the match with a total of 0/29 from 32 overs.Fingleton, p. 79. First Test Toshack's performance in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a single wicket in each innings. England won the toss and elected to bat. Toshack trapped the home captain Norman Yardley leg before wicket with a ball that straightened after pitching,Arlott, p. 32. ending with 1/28 as England were bowled out for 165. Toshack then came to the wicket at 9/476 and was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 33 with Johnston, scoring 19 runs‚Äîhis best at Test level to date‚Äîin just 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and freewheeling manner,Arlott, pp. 40‚Äì41. before falling lbw to Alec Bedser, ending Australia's innings on 509 with a 344-run lead. During the second innings, Bradman thought that rain might come so he utilised Toshack to bowl defensive leg theory. He did so to slow the scoring so that England would not have a lead by the time the rain came to create a sticky wicket, otherwise Australia would have been forced to chase a target on a difficult pitch with irregular bounce and pace.Fingleton, p. 101. As the umpires were obliged to not call off play unless the light was so poor as endanger the batsman, the lack of pace of Johnson and Toshack forced proceedings to continue as they posed no injury threat to the batsmen. Early on the fourth morning, Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly while bowling to Hutton and Denis Compton,O'Reilly, p. 48. but Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day as soon as it was available, taking Toshack off.Fingleton, p. 99. Later, Toshack was used defensively while Miller attacked from the other end.O'Reilly, p. 50. Bradman's response to a boundary being hit from Toshack was to further stack the leg side with fielders in defensive positions, and scoring was slow as Toshack bowled accurately. Toshack took the wicket of Joe Hardstaff junior for 43, who holed out to Hassett on the leg side, having supported Denis Compton in a partnership of 93.Fingleton, p. 102. The ball looped up in the air and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog.O'Reilly, p. 51. Toshack ended with 1/60 from 33 overs as Australia were one bowler short after an injury to Lindwall had prevented him from bowling since the first afternoon. England were bowled out for 441 and Australia reached the target of 98 with eight wickets in hand. Toshack was rested for the first tour match after the First Test against Northamptonshire, which Australia won by an innings. He returned against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane, Sheffield, making four as Australia batted first and scored 249. He then recorded the best innings analysis of his first- class career, taking 7/81 from 40 consecutive overs,Pollard (1990), p. 11.Fingleton, p. 195. bemusing the Yorkshire spectators with his Australian accent and distinctive \\"Ow Wizz Ee\\" appealing. He removed both openers, including Hutton, and then bowled Yorkshire and England captain Norman Yardley to leave the hosts at 3/107. After Yorkshire reached 4/149, Toshack took four more wickets as the hosts collapsed to be all out for 206. Wicket-keeper Ron Saggers stood up to the wickets and stumped Ted Lester before Toshack removed three lower-order batsmen. Toshack did not bat or bowl again as the match petered into a draw. Bradman decided to bat until late on the third afternoon and secure a draw instead of pressing for a win; Yorkshire only batted for 27 overs in their second innings and the crowd booed Bradman for not pursuing a victory. With the match safe, Bradman elected to rely mainly on his second- choice bowlers to conserve his frontline bowlers' energy for the next Test. Second Test Australia won the toss and batted first in the Second Test at Lord's. They were on the back foot at 7/258 at stumps on the first day.Fingleton, p. 110. On the second morning, the Australian lower order counter-attacked; Toshack joined Johnston with the score at 9/320 and they put on 30 runs before Johnston was stumped. Australia regained the momentum, adding 92 runs in 66 minutes of hitting in the morning. One sequence of two overs from Edrich was taken for 28 runs, with many balls unintentionally spooned over the slips or the covers. Both players swung wildly at the ball, which often went in vastly different directions to where they had aimed their shots. Both made new Test best scores; Toshack scored 20 not out. Both Johnston and Toshack‚Äînot known for their batting ability‚Äîplayed without inhibitions, joyfully revelling in their luck.Arlott, p. 61. England were then bowled out for 215. Toshack was wicketless, but was the most economical of the bowlers, conceding only 23 runs from his 18 overs. Toshack operated after the first new ball was taken, and as England had fallen to 4/46, they played him cautiously in an attempt to rebuild the innings.O'Reilly, p. 71. Australia then declared at 7/460 in their second innings with Toshack not required to bat, leaving England a target of 596. England progressed to 1/52 in their run- chase before a double strike by Toshack. Edrich and Washbrook fell in quick succession to leave England at 3/65. Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the slips and Tallon took a difficult catch to remove Washbrook.Fingleton, p. 121. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking that he may have hit a bump ball into the ground before it flew to Johnson, but the umpire ruled otherwise and gave him out.O'Reilly, p. 78. Washbrook inside edged a Toshack full toss directly downwards at Tallon's ankle. Bradman described the catch as \\"miraculous\\" because Tallon had to reach so low, so quickly, in order to complete the catch.Perry (2001), p. 199. English commentator John Arlott speculated that Edrich and Washbrook may have lost concentration after Lindwall was replaced by Toshack, lulled into a false sense of security once Australia's leading bowler was no longer operating.Arlott, p. 71. England then recovered to be 3/106 at stumps on the fourth day. Yardley and Tom Dollery took the score to 4/133 on the final morning before Toshack bowled the former for 11. He then trapped Alec Coxon two balls later in the same over for a duck, leaving England at 6/133. Coxon shuffled across his stumps and missed his first delivery, which hit him in front of the stumps and prompted a loud lbw appeal, and did the same thing to the next ball, and the umpire upheld the Australians' second appeal.O'Reilly, p. 74. During this spell, Toshack conceded only seven runs from eight overs, but was taken off as Bradman wanted to take the new ball and utilise Lindwall and Johnston.O'Reilly, p. 79. The match ended when Doug Wright hit Toshack to Lindwall and England were bowled out for 186, sealing a 409-run win for Australia. Toshack ended with 5/40 from 20.1 overs with Miller unable to bowl due to injury. During the second innings performance, Toshack employed two short legs and a silly mid-off. Arlott said that while Toshack had the best figures, Lindwall was the pivotal figure, at the latter \\"so patently disturbed Hutton he struck a blow at the morale of the English batting that was never overcome.\\"Arlott, p. 75. A match against Surrey started the day after the Second Test ended, but Bradman nevertheless asked Toshack to bowl 20 overs as Surrey batted first. He took 2/76 including opposition captain Errol Holmes. In reply to the hosts' 221, Toshack made one in Australia's total of 389. He then removed Arthur McIntyre and Eric Bedser in the second innings and ended with 2/29 as Australia won by ten wickets. Toshack was then rested after playing 12 days of cricket in two weeks, missing the innings victory over Gloucestershire. Third Test Toshack had a moderately successful Third Test, in which England elected to bat first. England lost two early wickets, and when Toshack came on, Jack Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point.O'Reilly, p. 90. As the hosts were in trouble, they played cautiously and Toshack's first five overs were all maidens.Arlott, p. 82. Crapp then hit Toshack to Sid Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs.Arlott, p. 83. Halfway through the day, England fell to 5/119, and captain Yardley came in. He hit Toshack in the air, but Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg. However, this error did not cost many runs. Yardley lofted Toshack into the on-side and the hands of Johnson at forward square leg to fall for 22 with the score at 6/141.Fingleton, p. 171. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his departure for 22 left the score on 141/6.O'Reilly, p. 92.Fingleton, p. 133. Toshack bowled Dick Pollard late in the innings to finish with 2/75 from 41 overs‚Äîincluding 20 maidens‚Äîas England ended with 363. Toshack was unbeaten on zero and was only at the crease for one minute as Australia replied with 221. In the second innings, Toshack removed Compton for a duck, caught in the slips by Miller, and ended with 1/26 as the rain-affected match ended in a draw. He also had Washbrook dropped in the slips cordon by Johnson, one of several times that the batsman was reprieved during the innings.Fingleton, p. 144. After bowling 53 overs in the Third Test, Toshack was rested for the match against Middlesex. It was the only tour match before the Fourth Test, and Australia won by ten wickets. Fourth Test Toshack's knee injury flared again in the Fourth Test at Headingley after England elected to bat. On the first morning, England opener Len Hutton edged Toshack through the slips and was then dropped on 25. Hutton eventually reached 81 as the opening pair put on 168.Fingleton, p. 152. Toshack was wicketless as the hosts closed the first day at 2/268. The following morning, he was removed from the attack after night-watchman Bedser hit him for three consecutive fours.Fingleton, p. 157. After the lunch break, Toshack bowled Jack Crapp with an inside-edged half volley for five to leave England at 5/447.Fingleton, p. 158.O'Reilly, p. 119. Toshack ended with an ineffective 1/112 from 35 overs as England made 496. He was the most expensive and uneconomical of the frontline bowlers and it was his most uneconomical performance in the Tests. He aggravated his knee injury and was later taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his bowling duties for the match and his Test career. Late on the third day, Toshack was part of a rearguard Australian action that minimised England's first innings lead. He came to the crease at 9/403 to accompany Lindwall,Pollard (1990), p. 14. featuring in a 55-run stand and lasting the final 50 minutes until stumps, with Johnston running for him. Australia were 9/457 at stumps, with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12.Fingleton, p. 167. Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over, but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get Toshack on strike.O'Reilly, p. 128. Despite Toshack and Johnston's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively, and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets, Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so that he faced most of the balls.O'Reilly, p. 131. On the next morning of play, Toshack did not add to his score before Lindwall was dismissed and Australia ended at 458 in the third over of the day, leaving the tourists 38 runs in arrears on the first innings. Toshack did not bowl in the second innings as England made 8/365 and set Australia a target of 404 for victory on the last day. Australia achieved the runs with seven wickets in hand, setting a new world record for the highest successful run-chase in Tests. After the injury at Headingley, Toshack was out of action for two weeks, missing the matches against Derbyshire, Glamorgan and Warwickshire. These fixtures ended in an innings victory, a rain-affected draw and a nine-wicket win respectively. He returned against Lancashire and scored two in Australia's 321. He then bowled seven overs in the first innings, taking 0/17. He aggravated his injury and did not bowl in the second innings and did not play again for the tour. As a result, Toshack missed the last Test and eight further tour matches, three of which were not first-class. Australia won the Fifth Test by an innings in Toshack's absence to win the series 4‚Äì0, and proceeded through the remaining tour matches undefeated. Role alt=Toshack started the season with five first- class innings outside the Tests, and all were less than 10 and four were less than five, none were not out. He then scored two scores between 15 and 20 in the Tests, with a score of four outside the Tests in between. After scores of 1 and zero not out in the next two tour matches, he scored 12 not out in his third and final Test innings. He then finished with two in a tour match. All of his efforts beyond ten were in Tests, and he passed ten in all three Test innings, two of these being not out. A left-arm medium-pace seamer, Toshack was a member of Bradman's first-choice team and he played in the first four Tests before being struck down by a persistent knee injury. Toshack contained the English batsmen using leg theory in between the new ball bursts of Miller and Lindwall,Cashman, pp. 299‚Äì300. usually bowling second change after Miller, Lindwall and Johnston. The English press decried Toshack's style of bowling as negative, but Jack Fingleton said that \\"he is generally so close to the stumps that nearly every ball has to be played\\". During the Tests, Toshack took 11 wickets at 33.09; his most notable performance was his 5/40 in the second innings of the Second Test at Lord's. Of the four frontline pacemen, Toshack had the second best economy rate, although with his leg stump bowling, he also had a strike rate of 94.45, while the other three fast bowlers all had strike rates below 70. It was a similar tale in the first-class statistics, with the second best economy among the seven frontline bowlers, but the worst strike rate. For the entire tour, Toshack took 50 wickets at 21.12 with four five- wicket innings hauls, including a best of 7/81 against Yorkshire at Bramall Lane. He also took 6/51 in the first innings of the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was almost entirely represented by English Test cricketers. Toshack took two catches on tour, none of them in the Tests. An inept batsman with an average of 5.78 in his first-class career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in a freewheeling tenth-wicket stand with Johnston. During the tour, Toshack had few opportunities with the bat, invariably being placed at either No. 10 and No. 11 in the order alongside Johnston, another tailender with little batting ability.N- Neither player ever passed 30 in their career,Cashman, pp. 152, 300. and they were the only two players who failed to make a half-century during the tour. As Australia's other specialist bowlers were Lindwall, McCool, Johnson and Doug Ring, all of whom made centuries and more than 18 fifties each during their first-class career,Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. Toshack and Johnston were invariably rooted at the bottom of the order. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings many times due to their batting strength, Toshack only had 12 innings in his 15 first-class fixtures, never batted in the second innings, and scored 78 runs at 8.66. Of the 78 runs, 51 came from four Test innings in Toshack's four Tests. Due to the fragility of his knee, Toshack was used sparingly in the tour games, playing in only 11 of the 29 non-Test matches on the tour,Pollard (1990), p. 19. the least of any player. Toshack was unable to play in the last nine matches of the tour, having injured himself in the second match against Lancashire.

Plot GX5 revolves around 5 teens who were invited to play the new game \\"Game Xtreme\\" and unwittingly get themselves trapped inside it. As they try to find ways and means to get out from their predicament, they realise that there's a strong opposing force who's trying to keep them in it and he's none other than the Evil Lord of Game Xtreme, Evil G, and his sidekick Spam. They managed to get out of the game not knowing that they still retained their powers and their superhero adventures have only just begun. Main charactersClaire Matthews= Claire is a 16-year-old girl. She is played by Kim Wakerman. Although fashion-conscious and vain, Claire is actually contrary to the bimbo she appears to be. She is not only fashionable but also witty and comes up with the best ideas in the group without much effort. She's brought up in an environment where she's often pampered and thus‚Äìfinds herself often in the center of attention: so she exhibits drama queen type personality. However, her obsession with looking picture-perfect is often a hindrance to the group's mission. Not only that, her strong opinions often sets off rant and rave sessions with Ryan. Catchphrase often used: ‚ÄúOh my goodness!‚Äù Superpower: Invisibility Somehow as if it was the exact opposite of her personality, the super power which she discovered she had after returning to the real world from the virtual gameworld is, surprisingly, invisibility. But as she'll discover: she can only use this superpower when she holds her breath. As such navigating her way around while staying invisible will be a bit of a challenge. =Ryan Tan= Ryan is 17 year-old played by Lenny Ross. An ardent gamer, Ryan is quite an irresponsible and lazy punk who spends too much time at gaming shops and too little time in school. Opinionated, Ryan is also often strong headed about many things in his perspective and as such often quarrels with the other vocal people around him with strong personalities. In part, this is due to his American accent while spending his younger years growing up in Los Angeles, before finally settling in Singapore. At times, he can be arrogant, sarcastic and playful, but this gradually changes as he learns from life lessons and becomes more responsible and accountable as being the eldest of the group. Super Power: Shape Shifting Probably one of the most unusual super powers of the group, Ryan is able to use this super power under intense concentration to shape shift to another person or object. But he must first be able to touch the person or object that he wants to the shape shift into. Although he can voluntarily change back to himself, he will involuntarily change back anytime should anyone in GX5 call out his name. =Wong Zhen Kai= Zhen Kai is 10 years old. He is short and small-built and life of the party. He is played by Yap Zheng Yan. As the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù of the group, Zhen Kai is adored by the others. Because of his age, he's usually ignorant about things around him and hence is often jovial, trusting and innocent. This leads to his fun-loving ‚Äòlive wire‚Äô nature. He also has a talent for wushu and it certainly comes in handy during GX5 fights. Not known by many, Zhen Kai's parents are also similarly jovial and fun- loving. Quite a fan of electronic games as well, Zhen Kai also likes typical fighting games and sometimes mimics the actions and moves. His innocence makes him lovable, even when he sometimes asks questions at the wrong time and under the wrong circumstances, whereas his over-optimistic nature sometimes gets on the nerve of others. The catchphrase he often uses is: ‚ÄúNice!‚Äù Super Power: Electric Bolts As an extension to his behaviour of being a livewire, Zhen Kai is able to shoot short-ranged electric bolts within visible distance‚Äìand hence is often a favourite among the others when it comes down to battles against the minions. =Chen Shu Yi= Shu Yi a 14-year-old athletic played by Ng Meizhi. She is a gymnast. A helpful and caring girl by nature, Shu Yi is the ‚Äúmother‚Äù of the group and makes sure everyone, especially Zhen Kai, is well taken care of. Pretty much an overachiever, she also often acts as the law- abiding/peacemaker during quarrels. She usually tries to correct other people's English which sometimes results in her being too helpful. Super Power: Freeze Shu Yi's superpower is freezing objects but she can only freeze one object or person and she must have it to be in her view for it to remain frozen. =Ridzwan Ali= Ridzwan is a 14-year-old, skinny and bespectacled geek played by Mohd Firdaus. The most academic of the group, Ridzwan has topped every class he was in since Primary 1. He reads extensively, even for leisure. He also gains his vast general knowledge online which is quite impressive and useful in their adventures. Because of this, he's often found in the library. Ridzwan's life has always been quite a private one and as such, not very street smart or savvy. He's also very proficient with the computer and has always been known to spew many technical abbreviations in place of words in his speech. Due of his non out-going nature, he is a relatively quiet boy and was even bullied by Ryan and his friends in the past. VillainsEvil G= Evil G is the villain played by Stuart Lightheart. Evil G is the classic villain that laughs with his signature evil laughter and threatens with his signature evil loud rants. Originally programmed to be the all-out baddie in Game Xtreme, the virtual gameworld, his role is simply to prevent all players in the game from escaping and he does this with his signature laughter and threats. Being stuck in the virtual gameworld and residing in his Evil room where he operates mainly from. When he's out in the real world, his role would then be to get them back into the gameworld. Evil G has no self-consciousness and no self-identity. His goal is just to get kids back into game. In contrast, in all seriousness, he is very different from Spam. His catchphrases are \\"I‚Äôll pull your plug!\\", \\"Wait till I erase your hard disk!\\" and \\"It‚Äôs be game over for you!\\" Spam Spam is Evil G's sidekick played by Wai Kit. As a very one-dimensional character, Spam the sidekick does not have much of either a background or a character except to eagerly follow the orders of his evil master, Evil G. His strength lies in his relentless execution of tasks assigned in an effort to please Evil G, even if it's beyond his means. He will try all sorts of ways to achieve it, and sometimes to extremely comical results. Spam has no self-consciousness and no self-identity. His goal is just to get kids back into game. He and Evil G communicate via a suspended visual/image. Often the catalyst of trouble, Spam is continually looking to create chaos.

For his role in the raid, Stevens was executed on March 16th, 1860 at the age of 29. Life Born in Lisbon, New London County, Connecticut, March 15, 1831. He moved with his family to Norwich, Connecticut at an early age when his father became choir director of the First Congregational Church. Stevens ran away from home at the age of sixteen, in 1847, and enlisted in Cushing's Massachusetts regiment of volunteers, in which he served in Mexico during the Mexican War. Later, he enlisted in Company F of the First United States Dragoons, and was tried for \\"mutiny, engaging in a drunken riot, and assaulting Major George A.H. Blake of the 1st U.S. Dragoons at Taos, New Mexico Territory, on March 8, 1855. Stevens was not drunk during the riot but was challenged by drunken Major Blake. According to testimony offered at a court of inquiry, the assault on Major Blake was precipitated by Stevens's outrage over Blake's continuous abuse of enlisted soldiers. Stevens and three other mutineers were sentenced to death, but these sentences were commuted by Secretary of War, Jefferson Davis to imprisonment for three years at hard labor at Fort Leavenworth, from which post he escaped and joined the Free State forces. In the free state force he became colonel of the Second Kansas Militia, under the name of Charles Whipple. He became Colonel of the 2nd Kansas Militia and met Brown on August 7, 1856, at the Nebraska line when Lane's Army of the North marched into \\"Bleeding Kansas.\\" He later became one of Brown's bravest and most devoted followers. While serving under Brown in Kansas, Stevens shot and killed a slave owner named David Cruise, in self defense, while attempting to free a female slave. According to Stevens's own account, while entering the home, Stevens saw Cruise reaching for a weapon and shot him dead. In subsequent years, Stevens freely admitted the killing but disliked talking about it. \\"You might call it a case of self-defense,\\" he recounted, \\"or you might say that I had no business in there, and that the old man was right.\\" Raid on Harper's Ferry In 1859, Stevens participated in John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia. According to the memoir of fellow raider Osborne Anderson, Stevens drilled Brown's men in military tactics and held \\"the active military position in the organization second to Captain Brown.\\" He was eventually trapped with Brown and several other raiders in the town engine house, during which time he argued heatedly with Brown over how to proceed tactically. Stevens suggested that the raiders flee. Brown, however, overruled Stevens and insisted that they remain inside the engine house waiting for the slaves to revolt and come to him \\"like bees to honey\\". When Brown sent him outside along with his son Watson Brown to negotiate under a flag of truce, Stevens was shot in the face and chest area and was captured by militia members. At first his captors could locate no pulse or heartbeat, yet Stevens remained awake and lucid. According to an eyewitness, when asked at this time if there was \\"anyone dear to him,\\" Stevens responded \\"All those who are good are dear to me.\\" George H. Hoyt, Brown's counsel, in a letter to J. W. Le Barnes, October 31, 1859, thus recorded his first impression of Stevens: > Stevens is in the same cell with Brown. I have frequent talks with him. He's > in a most pitiable condition physically, his wounds being of the most > painful and dangerous character. He has now four balls in his body, two of > these being about the head and neck. He bears his sufferings with grim and > silent fortitude, never complaining and absolutely without hope. He is a > splendid looking young fellow. Such black and penetrating eyes!

Origins of the VVTA VVTA operates local fixed-route, county commuter (discontinued in 2005), and ADA complementary paratransit bus services in the Victor Valley area. It has a maintenance facility located in Hesperia. The service structure consists of 23 local fixed and deviated routes, 3 County routes and ADA complementary paratransit service. VVTA was established through a Joint Powers Authority in 1991. The JPA includes the four cities of Adelanto, Apple Valley, Hesperia and Victorville and certain unincorporated portions of the County of San Bernardino including Oro Grande, Helendale, Lucerne Valley, Phelan, Pinon Hills, Wrightwood. Service is also provided to Barstow and Fort Irwin. The Fort Irwin service is branded as the NTC Commuter. The Board of Directors includes council members from the above cities and the San Bernardino 1st District Supervisor. Since 1998, the Board has held a management contract with McDonald Transit Associates, Inc. for administration of the system. In January 2005, the operations contract for all transit service in the Victor Valley area was consolidated under a separate contract with ATC (later Veoila, now Transdev). In 2018, National Express Transit became the system operator. =Barstow Area Transit= Barstow Area Transit formerly ran the transportation service in Barstow and surrounding areas of San Bernardino County, including the communities of Hinkley, Lenwood, Grandview, Yermo, Harvard, Daggett and Newberry Springs. It was merged into VVTA in 2015. MV Transportation, Inc. was contracted by the city to operate Barstow Area Transit. Barstow Area Transit operated Monday through Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and on the weekends from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 p.m; the system carried more than 144,000 passengers each year. The system featured three routes: Central Barstow, which was called Route 1 while running as a clockwise loop and Route 2 while running counterclockwise; West Barstow/Grandview/Lenwood, which was called Route 3 while running clockwise and Route 4 while running counterclockwise; and Hwy 58 which traveled crosstown as Route 5. Routes VVTA routes are grouped into two different categories: Deviated routes, and County routes. Deviated routes serve a pre-determined route and stops, but can deviate as far as 3/4 mile off that route to pick up passengers with advanced reservation. County routes are similar to Deviated routes, but they serve outlying rural areas and charge a higher fare. County routes do not charge a deviation fee for deviated trips to designated locations within outlying communities. 3-digit numbers (101 to 107) are typically reserved for weekdays, especially during rush hours. Fleet The VVTA operates 99 active and spare buses in its system as of June 2012, which uses El Dorado, NABI, New Flyer and Ford buses, and MCI for their Fort Irwin Service. Governance Victor Valley Transit Authority is administered by a Board of Directors, consisting of five Members (each with an alternate). The four board members from the cities are elected council persons assigned to VVTA by their respective city councils. The fifth Board member is the San Bernardino 1st District Supervisor (generally a staff person or the supervisor represents the County as the alternate). The Board is required under the JPA Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)to meet at least one time each quarter of each fiscal year. Board meetings are generally held every month . All meetings are held in compliance with the Ralph M. Brown Act. Board meetings are presided by the Board- appointed Chair. The Board of Directors is responsible for such acts as adopting the budget, approving route and schedule changes, holding the yearly unmet needs hearings, public hearings as required, appointing the CEO/General Manager, appointing a technical advisory committee, establishing policy, and adopting rules and regulations for the conduct of business. The VVTA Technical Advisory (TAC) committee is the working group for the VVTA Board. It is composed of a staff member from each of the cities and County who is generally appointed by the City Manager, County Supervisor. The TAC takes direction from the Board to make recommendations on policy issues. In addition, TAC reviews monthly all suggested Board agenda items and decides on what actions to recommend to the Board for approval.

The cavalry corps () of the Workers and Peasant Red Army was a type of military formation that existed from the early days of the Russian Civil War until 1947 when the Red Army was renamed as the Soviet Army and all cavalry corps were disbanded. The cavalry corps represented the foundation of large mobile formations in the Red Army, and most were converted to mechanized and motorized corps during the 1930s. However, due to severe losses in vehicles by the Red Army following the German invasion of USSR many more cavalry corps were raised. These corps initially included two cavalry divisions, two self-propelled artillery regiments, and a signals battalion and a tank battalion of 31 tanks. These light cavalry divisions were 3,447 me, 3,890 horses, eight 76.2mm guns twelve, 72.6mm howitzers, eight 45mm anti-tank guns, eight 120mm mortars, forty-eight 50mm mortars, nine12.7mm anti-aircraft machine guns, forty-eight heavy machine guns, 113 light machineguns. Medium tanks were often replaced with light tanks, tankllets, or armoured cars. This new smaller division considerably accelerated mobilization and proved easier to command for the great mass of inexperienced officers. Between July and December 1941, the cavalry arm expended from thirteen to eighty-two divisions. On paper the were authorized 128 sub machine-guns; however, like Pavel Belov 1st Guards cavalry Corps, most of the cavalry was primarily armed with rifles prior to the Moscow counteroffensive in December 1941.*Harrel, John (2019). Soviet Cavalry Operations During The Second World War: The Genesis Of The Operational Manoeuvre Group. Pen & Sword Military. In 1943 the cavalry was expanded into cavalry-mechanize groups with additional cavalry division being added, thus bringing the regular division to 6000. Additionally, all divisions received a tank regiment with its own airforce unit. While the Soviet cavalry was the most combat-ready arm of the Soviet ground forces, its tanks and trucks were in a deplorable state of operational readiness.John S Harrel The cavalry operated successfully during the whole war, particularly during the difficult early stages of the war. The speed of the German advance often spread out the units thinly, allowing Soviet cavalry formations to launch raids into its enemy‚Äôs rear. At dawn on August 28, 1941, Col. Lev Dovator led a cavalry group of three thousand sabers (accompanied by medium and light machine guns but no artillery or armor) in a mounted attack which, broke through the 450th German Infantry Regiment. Over the next two days, Dovator‚Äôs command inflicted some twenty-five hundred casualties on the Germans; they overran two regimental headquarters and the topographical department of the Sixth Army; they destroyed two hundred motor vehicles, two tanks, four armored cars, four artillery pieces, and six mortars; and they captured fifteen hundred rifles and automatic weapons, which were used to arm a partisan detachment left behind the German lines.Gervase Phillips Early in the war, tank and paratrooper units were put under the cavalry command during the most difficult situations. This demonstrates the significant role of the cavalry on the frontline as it was the most mobile force available during 1941-43. It is also important to note that; the cavalry almost always fought understrength of 3000 men at full strength for a division, while often being thrown into the hardest parts of the battle. A full-strength cavalry Corps of 18,000 men had to do the same output as an army of 60,000-100,000 men on the given task. Some legendary cavalry units often surpassed those expectations given to them by STAVKA as most famously Pavel Belov and Lev Dovator and later in their place Issa Pliyev and Viktor Kirillovich Baranov performed with most proficiency at all tasks never being surrounded or destroyed throughout the war. Despite the name, for the most part, the troops of the cavalry corps operated primarily as dismounted infantry. Soviet cavalry doctrine emphasized that cavalry should dismount to fight unless specific circumstances existed to attack mounted. Mounted attacks were called for when the enemy was weak and his defense unorganized. The enemy must be unaware of the cavalry's presence and the terrain must favor its approach.John S Harrel After the enemies retreated they were able to pursue the enemy on horses along with tanks resulting in great enemy losses. Their horses were the only units able to negotiate terrain that would prove difficult to motor vehicles, while at the same time being able to conduct rapid raids into the rear of the enemy positions. Often fighting along with other penetrating or later shock units, this was often done in the most crucial parts of the battlefield. During Battle of Moscow, the center Dovator was held and pushed back by many Soviet cavalry units including Lev Dovator who was KIA, along with Pavel Belov who helped lead and destroy Guderian army group enveloping southern Moscow helping the almost encircled 50th Army in Tula. Later during the crucial encirclement of the Battle of Stalingrad, the cavalry units with their mobility were the first to close the circle. These heroic actions were done often throughout the war resulting in another stunning achievement for the cavalry as they were the first to fully encircle Berlin. The Soviet Cavalry Corps was the largest of the cavalry units and was equal to an army on the battlefield, however during major operations cavalry groups such as Dovator and Belov were established to achieve the needed assignments. In June 1941, each Soviet Cavalry Corps consisted of 18,000 men, 15,552 horses, 124 tanks, 44 armored cars, 64 artillery 32 antitank guns, and 40 anti-aircraft guns. Each Cavalry Division was made of 3,000 men. Additionally having 128 tanks 36 armored cars, 64 artillery guns and AA guns over 76mm, 32 anti-aircraft, 120 mortars, and 430 light medium or heavy MGs. Each Cavalry Regiment had 32 heavy machine guns, 8 anti-tank guns, and 8 artillery pieces. John S Harrel Red Army cavalry organization differs considerably from the organization of US cavalry units. Numerically, Red Army units are the smaller. A Soviet cavalry corps is roughly equal numerically to a reinforced US horse cavalry division. Within the Red Army cavalry corps, also, are from two to four tank regiments as organic elements of the corps. The U.S.S.R. cavalry regiment is so designed as to provide a small and mobile striking force, heavily reinforced by supporting weapons. Numerically equal to less than half a Red Army infantry regiment, the U.S.S.R. cavalry regiment has almost as much firepower in supporting weapons.Article on the use of cavalry by the Red Army During the Battle for Moscow the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps along with other cavalry units played a key role in stopping the Germans from conquering the capital. Total cavalry numbered roughly 50,000 in the battle of which some consisted of Cossacks. These elite troops achieved great success from their advantage in cavalry, superior physicality, bravery, and mental strength made up for their small numbers. Cavalry were constantly on the move to disrupt lines with little sleep, as they fought by day and moved and raided at night. As was demonstrated during the 1941-42 Moscow counter-offensive, rifle units penetrated enemy lines, which were then successfully exploited by cavalry, supported by tanks. These mobile formations effectively disrupted the German rear, allowing Soviet riflemen to push back German lines. This cavalry tank tactic created a higher operational tempo, making it difficult for the Germans to re-establish a defensive line. John S Harrel These tactics were most famously applied by Lev Dovator who fell during the counteroffensive in the Battle of Moscow. Additionally Pavel Belov demonstrated this art of war successfully against Guderian's 2nd Panzer Group in the south part of the city, which later resulted in his famous 5-month raid behind the German 9th Army. Belov attacked the headquarters on a few occasions, while slipping away every time. This got the attention of Franz Halder who later had 7 German divisions on the pursue, this was over 100,000 men resulting in one of the greatest chases in world history earning him the nickname the Fox. More significantly, the raid so unnerved the German high command that it slowed its advance in that sector, withdrawing units from the frontline. Aircraft, armor, and motorized infantry all failed to intercept Dovator as he weaved across the country and passed safely back through the lines. By late summer, a number of new cavalry formations had been established, and the Soviet army would eventually field eight full cavalry corps. The contributions of Belov and Dovator in slowing down the Nazi advance were recognized, and they were given command, respectively, of the 1st and 2nd Guards Cavalry Corps.Gervase Phillips In the Battle for Stalingrad, three cavalry corps, the 8th (including the 21st, 55th, and 112th cavalry divisions), the 3rd Guards (including the 5th and 6th Guards and 32nd cavalry divisions) and the 4th Cavalry Corps (61st and 81st cavalry divisions) participated in the counter-offensive. These varied in strength between 22,500 and 10,200 personnel, and had from 18,000 to 9,000 horses. During the Second World War the cavalry corps were used primarily as components of the Cavalry Mechanized Groups that were inserted into the breakthrough sector of the Front following an offensive, paired with either a tank corps or a mechanized corps, providing additional mobile infantry component that could escort tanks and support them against enemy anti-tank defenses. Sometimes dismounted cavalrymen were used as tank desant to ensure closer cooperation between tanks and cavalry. Between April 1942 and July 1942, the Red Army, suffering a shortage of horses, disbanded 41 cavalry divisions. The lack of horses was the deciding factor in the reduction in the cavalry units.Walter Scott Dunn, The Soviet Economy and the Red Army, 1930-1945, p.234 Soviet cavalry was incorporated into a Cavalry Mechanized Group, which was very well equipped to perform shock attacks able to penetrate and pursue the enemy. remained an important factor in later stages of the war, for instance Operation Bagration might have not been as successful if it wasn't for mechanized cavalry units using deep battle penetration to keep up with the tanks upon breakthrough. Until the end of the war, the Soviet cavalry remained to be respected and feared by its enemies. In the final months, it demonstrated once more how effective cavalry could be in a modern age when applied properly, as they successfully encircled Berlin and later were instrumental in the Japanese in 1945 during the Battle of Manchuria, cementing their legacy as one of the finest units of the war.

A farmer and bushman, he ran his almost wild cattle in the glacier-cut Hollyford Valley in Fiordland, South Westland, New Zealand.  Biography  Gunn was the fourth of five children of Scottish parents, Isabella Grierson Robertson and her husband, Alexander Gunn. A one-time shepherd, Alexander Gunn ran a sheep farm of 27,000 acres in Central Otago.Waimate Daily Advertiser, page 3, 17 May 1917 For secondary schooling David lived at Hook, near Waimate, with his maiden aunts on their 500 acre farm. Leaving school, he briefly followed other family members into Dalgety's (an agricultural company), working as a clerk in a branch office before deciding the work did not suit him.Julia Bradshaw (with Murray Gunn), The Land of Doing without, Davey Gunn of the Hollyford, 2007, Canterbury University Press. He went back to work on and later manage the farm at Hook. He underwent military training at Trentham Military Camp in 1918, but was too late to be sent to fight in the First World War. A bridge on Gunn's Hollyford Track He went farming on his own account 100 miles south of Waimate at Sutton. On 10 July 1919 at Morven near Waimate he married Ethel May Willetts, a confectioner. They were to have two daughters, Isabel and Dorothy, and a son, Murray. His wife took their children to Oamaru to be educated and Gunn returned to his family for brief visits only twice a year. George Gunn, an early runholder, mapped some of the Hollyford Valley in 1861. In 1926 David Gunn bought freehold land there from remaining original settlers, the McKenzie family. He increased his Hollyford landholding in 1929, just before the onset of the Great Depression, by acquiring four leases totalling more than 25,000 acres. He then moved to the valley, establishing his solitary base at Deadman's Hut on the banks of the Hollyford River. Gunn cut a number of well used tracks and erected huts in the more remote parts of his run. Fox Moth crash Gunn came to public attention on 30 December 1936 with a speedy journey to assist the injured passengers of a de Havilland Fox Moth cabin plane he had seen crash into the sea at Big Bay. He covered the , four-day journey in just 21 hours, a feat which earned him a King George VI Coronation Medal the following year. Hollyford Track and tourism Mount Tutoko, Hollyford Track In 1936, Gunn began guiding tramping parties down his Hollyford Track, and would continue doing so until his death in 1955. Friendly and hospitable, possessing considerable personal charm, Gunn became a well- known and popular figure. He was respected for his bushcraft, his energy, and his knowledge of the area. On Christmas Day 1955, Gunn was fording the Hollyford River on horseback near Hidden Falls, with a 12-year-old boy mounted behind him. The horse stumbled and fell, and both riders were seen to find their feet in the river, until the horse stood up and they were both swept away and drowned. Gunn's body was never found. After his death his son, Murray, continued to guide trampers in the area, and started \\"Gunn's Camp\\", a rest-stop for trampers with store and small museum, which still stands near the southern end of the track, around from the Milford Sound-Te Anau highway.

Playing career Osman was born in the village of Bentworth near Alton, Hampshire but moved as a child to Okeford Fitzpaine in Dorset. As a teenager, he played football for Okeford United, before joining Poole Town, playing in the Western League, in 1930. In December 1935, he joined Plymouth Argyle of the Football League Second Division, where he remained until the summer of 1937. Despite making only five appearances for Plymouth, he had caught the eye of Tom Parker when he was manager of Norwich City. On joining Southampton in 1937, Parker signed Osman from Plymouth, as well as several youngsters from his previous club. Osman moved back to Hampshire on a free transfer, making his debut for Southampton (in the Football League Second Division) on 28 August 1937, the first day of the 1937‚Äì38 season. Osman made an immediate impact, scoring in a 3‚Äì4 defeat by Parker's old club. His next goal came on 18 September (against West Ham United) before starting a run of form in October which saw him score eight goals in four games, including a hat-trick in a 3‚Äì6 defeat at Luton Town. On Christmas Day 1937, the Saints played a home league match against Swansea Town in which Osman scored to bring the result level at 1‚Äì1; this was the last goal scored at The Dell on a Christmas Day. Although Christmas Day fixtures continued on‚Äìand‚Äìoff until 1959, all the Saints' subsequent Christmas Day matches were away from home. Osman's form continued and he only missed two matches at the end of the season, when he was the Saints' top‚Äìscorer with 22 goals (a club record for an outside‚Äìleft). His form had attracted the attention of bigger clubs, but a reported bid of ¬£7,000 from Birmingham failed to materialise. The following season, Osman continued to play well in an unsettled Southampton side that struggled to maintain any form. Unable to find the exciting form of the previous season, Osman managed only nine goals (from 30 appearances) before he was sold to Second Division rivals Millwall in March 1939 for a fee of ¬£2,000, a move that came as a shock to the Southampton fans, although, in hindsight, this turned out to be a very good piece of business. His career at Millwall was interrupted by the Second World War. He returned to The Dell as a guest player in War Leagues in 1939‚Äì40, before joining the Tank Corps where he was wounded while serving in Italy. After the war, he returned to Millwall making 23 appearances (with three goals) in 1946‚Äì47 before transferring to Bristol City in October 1947. At the end of the 1947‚Äì48 season he dropped down to lower league football with spells at Dartford and Canterbury City (where he was appointed player-manager) before returning to Hampshire with Winchester City in 1952. Managerial career He made a few appearances as a player for Winchester City before taking over as manager in 1953, while also running the Wykeham Arms pub in the city. In 1955, Osman played a 15-year-old Terry Paine in Winchester City's Hampshire League side. Paine's potential was obvious even at this age and Osman alerted his former Southampton teammate, now Southampton's manager Ted Bates to Paine's potential. Bates had Paine watched and in August 1956, beat Arsenal to his signature. After retiring from football management in October 1957, Osman emigrated to Palm Beach, Florida where he died on 17 December 1998.Social Security Death Index (SSDI) (Search for Harry J.

Building Free and Independent Media (August 1992). that is under financial and/or editorial control of a country's government, directly or indirectly. These news outlets may be the sole media outlet or may exist in competition with corporate and non-corporate media. State media is not to be confused with public-sector media (state-funded), which is \\"funded directly or indirectly by the state or government but over which the state does not have tight editorial control.\\" Overview Its content, according to some sources, is usually more prescriptive, telling the audience what to think, particularly as it is under no pressure to attract high ratings or generate advertising revenueSilverblatt & Zlobin, 2004, p. 22 and therefore may cater to the forces in control of the state as opposed to the forces in control of the corporation, as described in the propaganda model of the mass media. In more controlled regions, the state may censor content which it deems illegal, immoral or unfavourable to the government and likewise regulate any programming related to the media; therefore, it is not independent of the governing party.Price, Rozumilowicz & Verhulst, 2002, p. 6 In this type of environment, journalists may be required to be members or affiliated with the ruling party, such as in the former communist countries, the Soviet Union or North Korea. Within countries that have high levels of government interference in the media, it may use the state press for propaganda purposes: * to promote the regime in a favourable light, * vilify opposition to the government by launching smear campaigns * giving skewed coverage to opposition views, or * act as a mouthpiece to advocate a regime's ideology. Additionally, the state-controlled media may only report on legislation after it has already become law to stifle any debate.Karatnycky, Motyl & Schnetzer, 2001, p. 105, 106, 228, 384 The media legimitises its presence by emphasising \\"national unity\\" against domestic or foreign \\"aggressors\\".Hoffmann, p. 48 In more open and competitive contexts, the state may control or fund its own outlet and is in competition with opposition- controlled and/or independent media. The state media usually have less government control in more open societies and can provide more balanced coverage than media outside of state control.Karatnycky, Motyl & Schnetzer, 2001, p. 149 State media outlets usually enjoy increased funding and subsidies compared to private media counterparts, but this can create inefficiency in the state media.Stability Pact Anti-Corruption Initiative, 2002, p. 78 However, in the People's Republic of China, where state control of the media is high, levels of funding have been reduced for state outlets, which have forced the Party media to sidestep official restrictions on content or publish \\"soft\\" editions, such as weekend editions, to generate income.Sen & Lee, 2008, p. 14 Theories of state ownership Two contrasting theories of state control of the media exist; the public interest or Pigouvian theory states that government ownership is beneficial, whereas the public choice theory suggests that state control undermines economic and political freedoms. =Public interest theory= The public interest theory is also referred to as the Pigouvian theoryCoase, R. H. British Broadcasting, 1950. The following argument was formulated by the BBC in support of maintaining publicly subsidised radio and television in the United Kingdom and states that government ownership of media is desirable.Djankov, McLeish, Nenova & Shleifer, 2003, p. 341 Three reasons are offered. Firstly, the dissemination of information is a public good, and to withhold it would be costly even if it is not paid for. Secondly, the cost of the provision and dissemination of information is high, but once costs are incurred, marginal costs for providing the information are low and so are subject to increasing returns.Djankov, McLeish, Nenova & Shleifer, 2003, p. 342 Thirdly, state media ownership can be less biased, more complete and accurate if consumers are ignorant and in addition to private media that would serve the governing classes. However, Pigouvian economists, who advocate regulation and nationalisation, are supportive of free and private media.Lewis, 1955; Myrdal, 1953 =Public choice theory= The public choice theory asserts that state-owned media would manipulate and distort information in favour of the ruling party and entrench its rule and prevent the public from making informed decisions, which undermines democratic institutions. That would prevent private and independent media, which provide alternate voices allowing individuals to choose politicians, goods, services, etc. without fear from functioning. Additionally, that would inhibit competition among media firms that would ensure that consumers usually acquire unbiased, accurate information. Moreover, this competition is part of a checks-and-balances system of a democracy, known as the Fourth Estate, along with the judiciary, executive and legislature. Determinants of state control Both theories have implications regarding the determinants and consequences of ownership of the media.Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes & Sheleifer, 2002, 28-29 The public interest theory suggests that more benign governments should have higher levels of control of the media which would in turn increase press freedom as well as economic and political freedoms. Conversely, the public choice theory affirms that the opposite is true - \\"public spirited\\", benevolent governments should have less control which would increase these freedoms.Djankov, McLeish, Nenova & Shleifer, 2003, p. 343 Generally, state ownership of the media is found in poor, autocratic non-democratic countries with highly interventionist governments that have some interest in controlling the flow of information.Djankov, 2002, p. 21 Countries with \\"weak\\" governments do not possess the political will to break up state media monopolies.Price, 2004, p. 195 Media control is also usually consistent with state ownership in the economy.Djankov, 2002, p. 20 As of 2002, the press in most of Europe (with the exception of Belarus) is mostly private and free of state control and ownership, along with North and South America.Djankov, 2002, p. 19 The press \\"role\\" in the national and societal dynamics of the United States and Australia has virtually always been the responsibility of the private commercial sector since these countries' earliest days.Hoffmann-Riem, 1996, p. 3 Levels of state ownership are higher in some African countries, the Middle East and some Asian countries (with the exception of Japan, India, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nepal, the Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand where large areas of private press exist.) Full state monopolies exist in Burma (under the military rule) and North Korea. Consequences of state ownership Issues with state media include complications with press freedom and journalistic objectivity. According to Christopher Walker in the Journal of Democracy, \\"authoritarian or totalitarian media outlets\\" such as China's CCTV, Russia's RT and Venezuela's TeleSUR take advantage of both domestic and foreign media due to the censorship under regimes in their native countries and the openness of democratic nations to which they broadcast. =Press freedom= upright=2.25thumbright 2020 Press Freedom Index \\"Worse outcomes\\" are associated with higher levels of state ownership of the media, which would reject Pigouvian theory.Djankov, McLeish, Nenova & Shleifer, 2003, p. 344 The news media are more independent and fewer journalists are arrested, detained or harassed in countries with less state control.Djankov, 2002, p. 23 Harassment, imprisonment and higher levels of internet censorship occur in countries with high levels of state ownership such as Singapore, Belarus, Burma, Ethiopia, China, Iran, Syria, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Djankov, McLeish, Nenova & Shleifer, 2003, p. 367 However this is not always the case, the public broadcaster in the United Kingdom, the BBC, although funded by the public licence fee and government, is editorially independent from state control and acts with similar freedoms to the privately owned media.BBC Charter. A strong BBC, independent of government, March 2005 Countries with a total state monopoly in the media like North Korea and Laos experience a \\"Castro effect\\", where state control is powerful enough that no journalistic harassment is required in order to restrict press freedom. =Civil and political rights= The public interest theory claims state ownership of the press enhances civil and political rights; whilst under the public choice theory, it curtails them by suppressing public oversight of the government and facilitating political corruption. High to absolute government control of the media is primarily associated with lower levels of political and civil rights, higher levels of corruption, quality of regulation, security of property and media bias.Djankov, 2002, p. 24 Independent media sees higher oversight by the media of the government. For example, reporting of corruption increased in Mexico, Ghana and Kenya after restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, but government-controlled media defended officials.Simon, 1998Djankov, 2002, p. 25 =Economic freedom= It is common for countries with strict control of newspapers to have fewer firms listed per capita on their marketsLa Porta et al, 1997 and less developed banking systems.Beck, Demirguc-Kunt & Levine, 1999 These findings support the public choice theory, which suggests higher levels of state ownership of the press would be detrimental to economic and financial development.

Further messages from the Ekindi campaign on 9 October and 10 October were not allowed to be aired, however;Francis B. Nyamnjoh, Africa's Media, Democracy and the Politics of Belonging (2005), Zed Books, pages 142-143. according to the government, this was because Ekindi was \\"not respecting legal provisions\\".\\"Cameroon: A Transition in Crisis\\", Article 19 (UNHCR Refworld), October 1997. According to the official results of the 1992 election, Ekindi received 0.79% of the vote (a total of 23,525 votes) and placed fifth. His best performance was in the Far North Province, where he won 9,903 votes.Cameroon Tribune, 27 October 1992 (cited in Nantang Jua, \\"The Power Elite, the State, and Transition Politics in Cameroon\\", Political Liberalization and Democratization in Africa: Lessons from Country Experiences (2003), ed. Julius Omozuanvbo Ihonvbere and John Mukum Mbaku, Greenwood Publishing Group, page 97). When Biya garnered the nickname \\"Lion Man\\" (l'homme lion) at the time of the 1992 presidential election, Ekindi in turn garnered the nickname \\"Lion Hunter\\" (chasseur du lion) for his fierce opposition to Biya.Africa's Media, Democracy and the Politics of Belonging, page 153. Ekindi's stance on the issue of federalism varied at the time. He backed the idea on 4 February 1992 and urged Biya to not ignore the Anglophone problem, arguing that concerns about the possibility of Anglophone secession were baseless because the Anglophone parties were not seeking secession. However, he said in April 1992 that a unitary state was preferable because it would be less expensive than federalism. Political activities since 2003 In late 2003, Ekindi became the Chairman-in-Office of the Front of Alternative Forces, an opposition coalition.Fran√ßoise Ndame, \\"Inscription sur les listes √©lectorales: L‚Äôopposition s‚Äôorganise, le pouvoir panique\\", Le Messager (Cameroon-info.net), 14 January 2004 . Ekindi was briefly detained in Douala along with other members of the Front in January 2004 as they were about to launch a petition related to the forthcoming presidential election;\\"Amnesty International Report 2005 - Cameroon\\", Amnesty International (UNHCR Refworld), 25 May 2005. among other things, the petition called for the electoral register to be computerized and for electoral lists to be revised. He was again detained on 17 August 2004 at a march in Douala. In a September 2004 interview, Ekindi expressed his disapproval of the large number of political parties in Cameroon, arguing that it was not useful to have so many and that it made the political landscape crowded and chaotic. He said that many parties were created by individuals seeking only personal gain and that the government used agents to create new parties in order to disrupt the existing opposition. According to Ekindi, Cameroon would ideally have only three parties, one of them in power and the other two in opposition, and he proposed merger agreements to make that happen.Joe Dinga Pefok, \\"Cameroon Needs Only Three Political Parties - Ekindi\\" , The Post (Cameroon-info.net), 6 September 2004. Again running as the MP's presidential candidate in the 11 October 2004 presidential election, Ekindi submitted a legal challenge to Biya's candidacy at the Supreme Court in September 2004, arguing that the constitution barred Biya from standing for re-election while also serving as the President of the CPDM.\\"Cameroon election bid challenged\\", BBC News, 29 September 2004. Ekindi then announced his withdrawal from the election on 10 October in favor of John Fru Ndi, the candidate of the main opposition party, the SDF.\\"Presidentielle: Jean Jacques Ekindi se d√©siste au profit de John Fru Ndi\\" , AFP (Cameroon- info.net), 10 October 2004 . His name nevertheless remained on the ballot, and he placed 13th out of 16 candidates with 0.27% of the vote; he received his best score in the Far North Province, where he took 0.62% of the vote.2004 results page for Ekindi at official election website. After the 2004 election, Ekindi filed two petitions at the Supreme Court seeking the annulment of the election. The first petition dealt with Ekindi's argument that Biya was not a valid candidate because was simultaneously President of the Republic and President of the CPDM, while the second focused on allegations of misconduct in the election itself. The Supreme Court rejected both of Ekindi's petitions, along with all ten of the other petitions filed by others seeking the election's annulment, on 22 October.Kini Nsom & Nformi Sonde Kinsai, \\"Supreme Court Clears Way For Biya‚Äôs Victory\\", The Post (Cameroon), 25 October 2004. In an interview with The Post on 2 January 2007, Ekindi said that he planned to stand as a parliamentary and municipal candidate in Douala in the election held later that year. Also in that interview, he sharply criticized Biya's 2007 New Year address, arguing that it was inappropriate for Biya to criticize corruption and other problems when he, as President for the previous 24 years, was the person most responsible for the state of the nation. According to Ekindi, Biya's criticisms of the country's problems actually represented an admission of his own failure. Furthermore, in response to Biya's assertion that 2006 had been a good year, Ekindi said that this indicated that Biya was divorced from the stark reality experienced by the people.Joe Dinga Pefok, \\"Ekindi To \\"Tie Knot\\" With SDF At 2007 Elections\\", The Post (Cameroon), 6 January 2007. In the 22 July 2007 parliamentary election, Ekindi was elected to the National Assembly as an MP candidate in the Wouri Centre constituency of Littoral Province, where the MP received 22.43% of the vote and one of the three available seats. Ekindi was the only member of his party to win a seat in the 2007 election.\\"Legislatives 2007: Les r√©sultats de la Cour supr√™me\\" , Mutations (Cameroon-info.net), 13 August 2007 . During the campaign, he complained that the MP received only six seconds of airtime on television per day, giving it a total of one minute and 24 seconds for the whole campaign. According to Ekindi, this represented discrimination against small parties and was illegal.P. Ng‚Äôonana, \\"Propagande: Des acteurs pas sur la fr√©quence\\", La Nouvelle Expression (Cameroon-info.net), 20 July 2007 . He also headed the MP list for the concurrent municipal electionDippah Kayess√©, \\"Coalition: UDC et le MP font le travail en commun\\", Mutations (Cameroon-info.net), 19 July 2007 . in Douala 1 and won a seat as a municipal councillor there.Sandrine Tonlio, \\"Douala 1er - Ekindi contre l'adoption du compte financier\\", Mutations, 24 June 2009 . At the time of the election, the alliance between the MP and the SDF collapsed because, according to Ekindi, the SDF decided to run candidates in Wouri Centre and ignored the alliance. The MP instead formed an alliance with the Cameroon Democratic Union (CDU).Joe Dinga Pefok, \\"Ndam Njoya, Ekindi Agree On Mutual Support At Elections\\", The Post (Cameroon), 24 June 2007. During the re-election of Bureau of the National Assembly on 14 March 2008, Ekindi objected when Emilia Lifaka, the Vice-President of the CPDM Parliamentary Group, presented a \\"consensus\\" list of candidates for the Bureau. Ekindi said that he had not been consulted about the list and that it was therefore not based on a consensus. Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the President of the National Assembly, ignored Ekindi's objection.Kini Nsom, \\"Assembly Bureau Elections - Adama Modi Embarrasses Cavaye Again\\", The Post (Cameroon), 17 March 2008. After three broadcasting stations were temporarily shut down and broadcasting equipment was subsequently withheld from one of them, Ekindi alleged on 4 July 2008 that Minister of Communications Jean Pierre Biyiti bi Essam was \\"guilty of abuse of power\\".\\"Cameroon broadcaster's equipment held by police\\", Committee to Protect Journalists (UNHCR Refworld), 8 July 2008. Ekindi participated in political consultations with Prime Minister Ephra√Øm Inoni regarding the appointment of the members of Elections Cameroon (ELECAM), the national electoral commission. After Biya appointed the members of ELECAM on 30 December 2008, Ekindi said on 3 January 2009 that the appointments went beyond mere manipulation, which he had come to expect, and reached the level of blatant deception. According to Ekindi, he had not expected Biya to go so far as to appoint leading CPDM members to ELECAM, as the members of ELECAM were supposed to be neutral, independent individuals. Furthermore, he said that the consultations held prior to the appointments were useless because the proposals made during those consultations were completely ignored.Joe Dinga Pefok, \\"Ekindi Says Biya Violated The Law Appointing ELECAM Members\\", The Post (Cameroon), 5 January 2009. The MP failed to win any seats in the September 2013 parliamentary election, and Ekindi therefore lost his seat in the National Assembly.\\"Cameroun: le parti au pouvoir de Paul Biya remporte haut la main les l√©gislatives\\", Radio France Internationale, 17 October 2013 .

This unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet The Invincibles. The team's reserve wicket-keeper, Saggers played in only the Fourth of five Tests, due to an injury to first-choice gloveman Don Tallon. The match was Saggers's Test debut and he scored five in his only innings with the bat and took three catches. Despite being the second-choice gloveman, Saggers conceded byes at a lower rate than Tallon did during the English summer. During the Fourth Test, Saggers conceded only six byes as England amassed a match total of 861, the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match during the tour. Despite this, Tallon remained the favoured gloveman, as Bradman deemed him to be faster and more athletic. Bradman rotated the two glovemen during the tour, and Saggers played in 17 of the 31 first-class matches, taking 23 catches and 20 stumpings. Due to Australia's powerful batting line-up, Saggers had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 209 runs at an average of 23.22, including his only century at first-class level, 104 not out against Essex.  Background  Saggers started the tour as the clear second-choice wicket-keeper, as Don Tallon had played in each of Australia's 11 Tests since the resumption of cricket after the Second World War, while Saggers was yet to make his Test debut. Saggers made his first-class debut shortly before the start of the war, and after the resumption, was regarded as the second in line for Test selection behind Tallon. However, as Australia did not make any substantial tours in the years immediately after the end of hostilities, there was no need to take a reserve gloveman on such trips. However, the trip to England meant more than six months abroad, so a back-up wicketkeeper was needed, and Saggers was selected for his first national squad.  Early tour  Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Accordingly, Tallon was selected as the wicket-keeper for the match. Tallon scored six, made five dismissals and conceded 11 byes as Australia crushed the hosts by an innings and 17 runs. Tallon was then rested and Saggers took his place for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested for the next two matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted steadily with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing his hand over his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.Perry (2000), p. 197. While Tallon nursed a bruised finger, Saggers played in three successive tour matches. Against Cambridge University, he made two stumpings and took one catch, and was not required to bat as Australia won by an innings. He then played in the match against Essex where Australia scored 721 runs on the first day to set a new world record for the most runs scored in a day of first-class cricket. Saggers made his highest first-class score, 104 not out--the only first-class century of his career--in a partnership of 166 runs in 65 minutes of batting with Sam Loxton. This made him the fourth century-maker for the innings after Bill Brown, Bradman and Loxton. Of Saggers's innings, former Test batsman Jack Fingleton said that \\"he reminded me at times of Alan Kippax in his artistry. He plays all the strokes.\\"Fingleton, p. 67. Saggers took one catch as Australia won by an innings and 451 runs, their largest winning margin of the season. He then faced Oxford University, scoring six runs and taking one catch in another innings victory. Saggers conceded six, eight and 14 byes respectively in the three matches. Up to this point, Saggers had conceded only 34 byes in his four tour matches, while Tallon had conceded 46 in three.N- The next match was against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who went on to represent England in the Tests,N- and were basically a full- strength Test team, as were Australia, who fielded their first-choice team. It was a chance for players from both countries to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Test matches, and Tallon was selected ahead of Saggers despite conceding byes at a higher rate in the opening tour matches. Saggers looked on as Tallon conceded 26 byes and Australia won by an innings. There were four more county fixtures before the First Test, against Lancashire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and Sussex. Australia drew the first two before winning the latter pair by eight wickets and an innings and 325 runs respectively. Saggers played in all but the Nottinghamshire match. Against Lancashire, Saggers came in at 6/145 and held up his end, making an unbeaten 22 as Australia reached 204. He then completed a stumping and conceded 11 byes as the hosts replied with 182 before the rain-affected match ended in a draw. Saggers went without a dismissal and conceded 16 byes as Hampshire made 195 in their first innings. He came to the crease with Australia having scored 98 runs for the loss of seven wickets (7/98) and was last man out for 17, one of only four players to pass five, as Australia made 117 and conceded a first innings lead for the first time in the season. He then completed another stumping in the second innings and conceded four byes as Australia recovered to win by eight wickets. Saggers' final opportunity to stake a claim for Test selection was in the match against Sussex. He did not concede a bye and took a catch in the first innings. Saggers was not required to bat as Australia declared their innings closed at 5/549, and then made three more dismissals and conceded five byes as Australia won by an innings.  Test omission  Saggers (centre) pictured with Stan McCabe (left) and Don Tallon (right) during a country match in 1945. In Saggers' last three matches before the First Test, he conceded 36 byes and made six dismissals. In contrast, Tallon conceded 18 byes in his only match and scored 27. Despite averaging more byes per innings than Saggers during the warm-up matches,N- Tallon was retained in the Test team. He took four catches and conceded 17 byes as Australia won by eight wickets. Between Tests, Australia played Northamptonshire and Yorkshire, and Tallon was rested for both matches. The first was won by an innings and the second was drawn. Saggers scored four against Northamptonshire and 22 against Yorkshire. After not making a dismissal against Northamptonshire, he took two catches and two stumpings in the latter match. He conceded 14 and 10 byes in the two matches respectively. Tallon was retained for the Second Test at Lord's, where he scored 53, took three catches and conceded 16 byes as Australia won by 409 runs. A dive to stop a leg glance resulted in Tallon severely bruising the little finger on his left hand.Perry (2000), p. 200. Nursing his finger injury, Tallon was rested for both tour matches between the Tests, which were against Surrey and Gloucestershire. Australia won the matches by ten wickets and an innings respectively. In Tallon's place, Saggers scored 12, completed a catch and made four stumpings while conceding 18 byes against Surrey. In the match against Gloucestershire, Saggers was deprived of an opportunity to bat as Australia amassed 7/774, its highest score of the tour and its second highest ever in England. He took two catches, completed three stumpings and conceded 13 byes for the match. Tallon was retained as the teams then played out a draw in the Third Test at Manchester.Lemmon, p. 103. During the match, Tallon conceded 16 byes and dropped Denis Compton three times as the English batsman went from 50 to 145 not out.Fingleton, pp. 131-137. Tallon's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he exacerbated the injury during the next tour match against Middlesex, which Australia won by ten wickets.  Test debut  As a result of Tallon's finger injury, Saggers made his Test debut in the Fourth Test, which started at Headingley on 22 July 1948. As England made 496 runs in their first innings, Saggers took catches to remove Denis Compton for 23, caught down the leg side,Fingleton, p. 158. and Jim Laker for four. During the innings, Saggers was noted by Fingleton for maintaining a quiet presence behind the stumps, whereas Tallon was characteristically known for loudly appealing in concert with the bowler when he was playing. Fingleton felt that Saggers' failure to appeal dampened the morale of the bowlers, who were vocally supported by Tallon in the other four Tests.Fingleton, p. 152. Australia conceded 496 runs but Saggers leaked only two byes. Australia replied with 458, but Saggers was unable to make a substantial contribution, stumped by England's wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans off the bowling of Laker for only five runs. England's second innings reached 8/365, as Saggers took one catch to secure the wicket of Ken Cranston and conceded four byes. This left Australia needing a world record Test run chase of 404 for victory. However, an innings of 182 runs from Arthur Morris and 173 not out from Bradman meant that Saggers was not required to bat in the second innings; Australia defeated England by seven wickets, and set a world record for the highest successful Test run chase. Saggers's six byes out of England's match total of 861 runs was the lowest percentage of byes conceded by Australia in a match on the tour.N- Saggers made six not out, completed two catches, a stumping and conceded 15 byes in the innings victory over Derbyshire, before being rested in the next match against Glamorgan. In his first match back from injury, Tallon took a catch and two stumpings, but conceded 19 byes in a rain-affected draw. Tallon's byes were 9.64% of the hosts' total, the highest percentage contribution made by byes to an innings on the tour.N- Saggers returned for the nine-wicket win over Warwickshire and struggled, making a duck. Although he took two catches and a stumping, he conceded 28 byes, 9.56% of Warwickshire's total runs, the second highest percentage contribution of byes to a match total against Australia.N- Saggers was then rested for Australia's second match and second draw against Lancashire as Tallon made three dismissals and conceded 23 byes. In the non- first-class match against Durham, Tallon played purely as a batsman, while Saggers kept wicket. Saggers came in at 8/226 and made 22 to help Australia reach 273. He then made two stumpings and conceded four byes as the hosts reached 5/73 when rain ended the match. With Tallon fit again for the Fifth Test, Saggers was omitted as Australia won by an innings and 149 runs to complete a 4-0 series victory.  Later tour matches  Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to complete an English tour without defeat. Tallon was rested for three consecutive matches against Kent, the Gentlemen of England, and Somerset, and Saggers kept wickets in all three fixtures; Australia won all three by an innings. Saggers made only eight as Australia scored 361 against Kent. He then conceded only two byes and took two catches and made two stumpings as the home side made 51 and 124. Saggers did not bat as Australia amassed 5/610 against the Gentlemen of England. He then took a catch and conceded 19 byes as Australia enforced the follow on and won. The match against Somerset was similar; Saggers did not bat in Australia's 5/560 declared, before making two stumpings and conceding eight byes. In total, he made seven dismissals and conceded 29 byes in the six innings of the three matches. Saggers was rested as Tallon returned for the following match against the South of England. Tallon took three catches and conceded 13 byes before the match was washed out when the hosts were dismissed for 298. Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson- Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full- strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted that only six current Test players be allowed to represent the hosts.Fingleton, pp. 207-209. Bradman then fielded a first-choice team;Perry (2005), pp. 253-254. the only difference from the Fifth Test team was Ian Johnson's inclusion at the expense of Doug Ring. Saggers was left out as the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. In the first match, Tallon played as a batsman while Saggers kept wicket. Saggers scored only eight in Australia's 236 and then took two catches, three stumpings and conceded 13 byes in the innings victory. In the second match in Aberdeen, Saggers was rested as Australia completed another innings win.  Role  A chart showing Saggers's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate not outs. The reserve wicket-keeper, Saggers played in 17 first-class matches and scored 209 runs at an average of 23.22, including a career high score of 104 not out against Essex,Cashman, p. 267. 23 catches and 20 stumpings, also career records for one season. This compared with the first-choice gloveman Tallon, who scored 283 runs at 25.72. In all his matches on tour, Tallon missed 249 byes as Australia conceded 5331 runs, a bye percentage of 4.67%. In contrast, Saggers conceded 221 byes from the 6190 runs scored against Australia when he was behind the stumps, a percentage of 3.57%.N- In his 1950 book Farewell to cricket, Bradman said of Saggers, \\"[he] had not quite the speed or agility of Tallon but could always be relied on for a solid performance. A most polished and unostentatious player.\\"Bradman, p. 227. During the tour, Saggers had few opportunities with the bat, generally batting between No. 8 and No. 10,N- because Australia's frontline bowlers included the likes of Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson and Doug Ring, who were all capable batsmen. Lindwall scored two Test centuries in his career, while McCool scored 18 first-class centuries, one in Tests. Johnson and Ring both scored more than 20 fifties at first-class level.Cashman, pp. 152, 175, 199, 258. As a result, many of the bowlers batted before he did. As Australia often won by an innings, and declared in the first innings on many occasions, Saggers only had 12 innings in his 17 first-class fixtures and was not out three times after his remaining partners had been dismissed.

The concession came to an end in 1943 when the French State under German pressure signed it over to the pro-Japanese Reorganized National Government of China in Nanjing. For much of the 20th century, the area covered by the former French Concession remained the premier residential and retail district of Shanghai, and was also one of the centres of Catholicism in China. Despite re-development over the last few decades, the area retains a distinct character and is a popular tourist destination.  History  Rue du Consulat (East Jinling Road), the rue principale or \\"high street\\" of the original French Concession, pictured in the 1930s. =Establishment= The French Concession was established on 6 April 1849, when the French Consul to Shanghai, Charles de Montigny, obtained a proclamation from Lin Kouei (È∫üÊ°Ç, Lin Gui), the Circuit Intendant (Tao- tai/Daotai, effectively governor) of Shanghai, which conceded certain territory for a French settlement. The extent of the French Concession at the time of establishment extended south to the Old City's moat, north to the Yangjingbang canal (Yang-king-pang, now Yan'an Road), west to the Temple of Guan Yu (Koan-ti-miao, ÂÖ≥Â∏ùÂ∫ô) and the Zhujia Bridge (Tchou-kia-kiao, Ë§öÂÆ∂Ê°•),The commonly recorded \\"ËØ∏ÂÆ∂Ê°•\\" appears to be an erroneous back-translation from a French source: ÂüéÂå∫Âè≤È¶ñÂú®Âè≤ÊñôÂáÜÁ°Æ--„Ää‰∏äÊµ∑Âç¢ÊπæÂüéÂå∫Âè≤„ÄãËã•Âπ≤Âè≤ÊñôÈóÆÈ¢òÂïÜÊ¶∑ÔºàËÆ∏Ê¥™Êñ∞Ôºâ and east to the banks of the Huangpu River between the Guangdong-Chaozhou Union (Koang'tong-Tchao-tcheou kong-hoan) and the mouth of the Yangjingbang canal. The French Concession effectively occupied a narrow \\"collar\\" of land around the northern end of the Old City, south of the British settlement. At an area of 66 hectares (986 mu), the French Concession was about a third of the size of the British settlement at that time. A further small strip of riverside land to the east of the Old City was added in 1861, to allow the construction of the quai de France, to service shipping between China and France. =Rise and Fall= Avenue Joffre in the 1930s: one of the major commercial streets in the French Concession The same location (now Huaihai Road) in 2007: many street front buildings have been preserved, and highrises also line the street A house on Wukang Road (Route Ferguson), a well-preserved example of a residential street in the former French Concession The French Concession's first significant expansion was agreed in 1899 and proclaimed in 1900, allowing the French Concession to double in size. The area newly added to the concession sat immediately to the west of the original grant. In 1902, the French introduced from France London planes (le platane commun) as a roadside tree on Avenue Joffre (present-day Huaihai Road). Now popular as a roadside tree throughout China, because of its history it is known in Chinese as the \\"French plane\\". Meanwhile, from 1860s, the French Concession authorities (like the other concession authorities) had begun constructing \\"extra-settlement roads\\" outside the concession, under the supervision of the French diplomat Albert-√âdouard Levieux de Caligny with a letter of support initiative and approval sealed by the Qing authorities. The first such road was built to connect the west gate of the Old City to the Catholic stronghold at Zi-ka-wei (Xujiahui), to allow French troops to quickly move between the concession and the Catholic Church land located in the area. Controlled by concession authorities, extra-settlement roads effectively gave France and the other treaty powers a form of control over land extending outside their formal concessions. In 1913, France requested police powers over its extra-settlement roads, effectively meaning a further expansion to the concession. The government of Yuan Shikai agreed, giving France police and taxation powers over the so-called extra-settlement roads area, in return for France agreeing to evict revolutionaries from the area under its jurisdiction. This agreement proclaimed in 1914, gave the French Concession control over a significantly larger area between the Old City and Xujiahui, 15 times the size of the original grant. As a nod to the more numerous Chinese residents in the new territory, two seats were given to Chinese members on the Administration Council. Encouraged by the successful expansion by the French, the Shanghai International Settlement also requested the grant of administrative powers over its own extra-settlement roads area in 1914, but this was refused. By the 1920s the French Concession was developed into the premier residential area of Shanghai. In particular, the expansive and initially sparsely populated \\"New French Concession\\" obtained under the second expansion of 1914 became popular for foreign nationals of all nationalities, and later well-to-do Chinese residents as well, to build houses on larger plots of land than they could obtain in the more crowded original concessions. As demand grew, numerous apartment buildings at varying levels of luxury were built, as well as some shikumen residences to meet demand from the increasing number of Chinese residents. Vibrant commercial areas also developed, helped by the influx of White Russians after the Russian Revolution. = Beginning of the end = During the Battle of Shanghai, the Chinese bombed the concession twice by mistake and killed several hundred people. When the Japanese took Shanghai in battle, their troops crossed without opposition the International Concession, but at the entrance of the French Concession, Vice Admiral Jules Le Bigot commanding the Naval Forces in the Far East sat on a folding chair in the middle of the street in front of their vehicles and forced them to negotiate to finally let only an unarmed supply convoy pass. On 4 December 1937, Japanese unarmed convoys were allowed to cross the concession. As early as 1941, the occupation of Shanghai by the troops of the Japanese Empire forced tens of thousands of Chinese to take refuge in the concessions. =Demise and legacy= A quiet, leafy street in the former French Concession In 1943, during World War II, the government of Vichy France announced that it would give up its concessions in Tianjin, Hankou and Guangzhou. These were handed over to the Wang Jingwei Government on 5 June 1943, with the Shanghai Concession following on 30 July. After the war, neither Vichy France nor Wang's Nationalist Government were universally recognised as legitimate, but the new post-war government of France acknowledged that it was a fait accompli in the Sino-French Accord of February 1946. This accord, signed by Chiang Kai- shek's ruling Kuomintang led to Chinese troops pulling out of the northern half of French Indochina in exchange for France relinquishing all its foreign concessions in China including Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan. The former French Concession remained largely unchanged during the early decades of Communist rule in China. In the late 1980s and the early 1990s, however, largely unregulated re- development of the area tore apart many old neighbourhoods. For example, the London Planes that graced the former Avenue Joffre were removed in the 1990s, only to be later replaced after public outcry. The old French Club building and its gardens, which used to be a sports field in the early days, were gutted and became the base of the high-rise Okura Garden Hotel. After the 2000s, the government enforced more stringent development and planning controls in this area.  Extent  A mix of the old and the new in the former French Concession near Avenue Joffre: the gabled building on the left is the former Belgian consulate, while the taller buildings on the right are the 1930s Henry Apartments and Gascogne Apartments From 1914 until its abolition, the French Concession covered the north-eastern part of today's Xuhui District and the western part of Huangpu District (the former Luwan District), occupying the centre, south, and west of urban Shanghai. A small strip extended eastward along the rue du Consulat, now the East Jinling Road, to the Quai de France, now East-2 Zhongshan Road, which runs along the Huangpu River to the south of the Bund. To the south-east of the French Concession was the walled Chinese city. To the north was the British concession, later part of the Shanghai International Settlement. The British and French quarters were separated by several canals: in the east, this was \\"Yangjingbang\\", a creek flowing into the Huangpu River. These canals were later filled in and became Avenue Edward VII in the east and Avenue Foch in the west, both now part of Yan'an Road. To the south, the French Concession was bounded by the Zhaojiabang canal (now filled in as Zhaojiabang Road and Xujiahui Road).  Governance  Official residence of the president of the Municipal Council The first French Municipal Council building on rue du Consulat, c. 1908 The chief French official in charge of the French Concession was the Consul-General of France in Shanghai. While the French initially participated in the Municipal Council of the International Settlement, in 1862 a decision was made to exit the Municipal Council to preserve the French Concession's independence. From then on, a day-to-day governance was carried out by the Municipal Administrative Council (conseil d'administration municipale). The council's offices were originally on rue du Consulat, the \\"high street\\" or rue principale of the original concession. In 1909, a new building was completed on Avenue Joffre. This building is now part of a shopping centre. Security in the Concession was maintained by the French Concession Police or Le Garde municipale de la Concession fran√ßaise. Just as the British employed many Indian police in the International Settlement, the French deployed many personnel from its nearby colony of Annam. A militia, the corps de volontaires, was first raised in the 1850s to protect the Concession during the Taiping Rebellion. From 1915 a battalion of Tirailleurs Tonkinese (colonial infantry) from French Indo China provided a military garrison for the French Concession. As a treaty power which had been granted extraterritorial jurisdiction, France exercised consular jurisdiction in the French Concession. Cases involving French nationals were heard by the French consular court. Matters involving Chinese nationals, or nationals or non- treaty powers, were heard in the International Mixed Court for the French Concession, a court nominally headed by a Chinese official but \\"assisted\\" by French consular officials, and using an adapted version of Chinese procedural rules. The International Mixed Court was abolished in 1930 and replaced by Chinese courts under the judicial system of the Republic of China. The French consulate also has the French Consular Police under its command.  Demography  Orthodox Cathedral of the Mother of God An example of a building in the Shanghai French Concession While the French Concession began as a settlement for the French, it soon attracted residents of various nationalities. In the 1920s, with the expansion of the French Concession, British and American merchants who worked in the International Settlement often chose to build more spacious houses in the newer part of the French Concession. One legacy of this Anglophone presence is the American College on Avenue P√©tain (now Hengshan Road), and the nearby Community Church. Shanghai saw a large influx of Russian √©migr√©s in the wake of the 1917 Russian Revolution. This raised the Russian population in the French Concession from 41 in 1915 to 7,000. This number increased to 8,260 by 1934 after the Japanese occupation of northeast China, where many Russians worked on the Chinese Eastern Railway. Two Russian Orthodox churches can still be seen in the former French Concession. The Russian community had a large presence on commercial streets such as Avenue Joffre and contributed to the development of the music profession in Shanghai. The Chinese population in the French Concession swelled during the Taiping Rebellion, reaching about 500,000 just before the start of the Second Sino- Japanese War. During World War II, Japanese forces initially occupied only the Chinese areas, leaving the foreign concessions alone. Residents of the Chinese areas moved into the French Concession in large numbers, reaching 825,342.  Localities  Clements Apartments on Rue Lafayette Normandie Apartments, on Avenue Joffre * Lokawei (), \\"Lu's Bay\\", an area named after a bend on the Zhaojiabang creek. The main police depot and prison of the French concession was located here. Former Luwan District, today part of Huangpu District, was named after this locality. Since the 1990s, this area has seen high volume residential developments. * Zikawei (\\"Xu's Confluence\\", or \\"Xujiahui\\" in Mandarin), an area named after the family of Xu Guangqi and the confluence of two local rivers. While Xujiahui was technically not part of the French Concession (lying immediately west of the boundary of the concession), it was the centre of Catholic Shanghai, featuring St Ignatius Cathedral, the Observatory, the Library, and several colleges, all of which were French- dominated. Today, Xujiahui is a busy commercial district. Today's Xuhui District is named after this locality. * Avenue Joffre, now Central Huaihai Road, was a boulevard stretching across the French Concession in an east-west direction. The road was renamed after Joseph Joffre in 1916, with the new name unveiled by the marshal himself in 1922. Avenue Joffre was a tram route. Its eastern section featured Shikumen residences. Its western part featured high- end residential developments, including standalone houses and apartment blocks. The central section was ‚Äì and is ‚Äì a popular shopping area, with many shops opened by the Russian community. The former Avenue Joffre remains a high-end retail district. * Avenue P√©tain, now Hengshan Road, was a major boulevard linking Xujiahui with the centre of the French Concession. It represented the centre of the French Concession's high-end residential district and featured many mansions and expensive apartment buildings. Since the 1990s, some of the former houses have been converted into bars and nightclubs, making Hengshan Road one of Shanghai's premier night entertainment districts. = Historical buildings in the French Concession = File:Fazujie Gongshenhuixie Jiuzhi.jpgFormer site of the International Mixed Court for the French Concession File:Fazujie Baochanglu Xiaofangzhan.jpgFormer Route Paul Brunat fire station File:Poste de Police Joffre.jpgFormer Avenue Joffre police station File:Fazujie Jingwuchu Jiuzhi.jpgFormer Garde Municipale headquarters File:Sun Yat-Sen's House.jpgFormer residence of Sun Yat-sen File:The Cloister Shanghai.JPGThe Cloisters, a residential building File:The Times They Are A-Changin'.jpgGrosvenor House, an apartment building, now part of a hotel File:Lyceum Theatre.jpgLyceum Theatre, mainly used by British residents File:St. Marie Hospital, Shanghai.jpgFormer H√¥pital Sainte Marie  In popular culture  * The French Concession is portrayed in Jules Verne's novel Tribulations of a Chinaman in China (1879). * The French Concession is where Adeline Yen Mah stayed in her autobiography Chinese Cinderella (1999). * The French Concession is portrayed in Lisa See's novel Shanghai Girls and Dreams of Joy. * The French Concession is portrayed in the 2015 Hong Kong TVB Drama, Lord of Shanghai.

History Born in Lost Nation, Iowa to Jerome McAndrews and Agnes Carrington, she graduated from the University of Western Illinois. In 1990, her son James, daughter Rebecca, and her son-in-law Mat, were all called into active duty during Operation Desert Storm. Plus, her son Tommy was in the U.S. Army Reserves. She reacted to the stress of the situation by overeating and by her mid-40s weighed 300 pounds. She began to think about her own mortality‚Äîand how her weight problem had created a life- threatening situation. She realized that diets had never helped her, and that if she reclaimed her health she could reclaim her life. In order to do so, she devised a method of \\"exchanges\\" to enable herself to eat all the food she loved while exchanging the fats and sugars with healthier choices. As friends asked for more and more of her recipes, she created her first cookbook, The Healthy Exchanges Cookbook. Re-published by G.P. Putnam's Sons in 1993, it has since sold hundreds of thousands of copies. The cookbook proved to be only the beginning of Lund's career. The former self-proclaimed \\"diet queen\\" from DeWitt, Iowa authored several books and the founder of Healthy Exchanges, Inc., a company that publishes a monthly newsletter with a subscriber base of 15,000, motivational booklets and inspirational audio and video tapes. According to People Magazine, the company is a $1 million enterprise that employs 30 people. After starting her business, Lund became a nationally known spokeswoman for healthier eating. She was elected to represent Iowa at President Clinton's White House Council on Small Business in 1995. During that same year, the Governor of Iowa appointed her to serve on the Iowa Rural Health & Primary Care Commission. She hosted a weekly radio show on WOC Radio in DeWitt and was featured in National publications such as The New York Times, People and Forbes. She has been interviewed on hundreds of regional television and radio shows, and is one of the top-selling cookbook authors on the television shopping channel, QVC. During one hour-long appearance on QVC, she sold almost 200,000 books. In January 1997, she launched her own cooking show on PBS-TV, JoAnna Lund's HELP Yourself. Lund was a member of the International Association of Culinary Professionals; Society for Nutrition Education; National Federation of Press Women; Association of Food Journalists; Mid-America Publishers Association; National Association of Independent Publishers; Publishers Marketing Association; and the International Association of Independent Publishers. She was a recipient of a Certificate of Nomination as Inc. Magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year from Iowa for 1993-95. She worked as a commercial insurance underwriter for 18 years before starting Healthy Exchanges. Lund appeared on CNN and the Home Shopping Club and wrote numerous cookbooks. Lund sold the most books on QVC Shopping network, up to the time of her death in May 2006. When she died QVC even had a memorial flash screen remembering her the following weekend all day on the hour during the network broadcast. Death JoAnna Lund died of inflammatory breast cancer on May 20, 2006, aged 61. She had asked that Healthy Exchanges continue after her death through books and the newsletter.

She was the CEO of Sanyo Electric from 2005 to 2007.  Television career  Beginning in 1979, Ms. Nonaka was a newscaster and anchorwoman for NHK, the national TV station in Japan. Her main programs at NHK included Weekly Abroad„ÄÅSports and News„ÄÅSunday Sports Special and others. From 1993 to 1997, she was the anchorwoman for the popular business program World Business Satellite at TV Tokyo. In addition to activities as a journalist, she has been member for many Japanese government committees for Cabinet Office, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Furthermore, she has been adviser and a member of the board of directors for many large Japanese corporations such as Asahi Breweries, Sumitomo Corporation, NTT Docomo, Nikko Citigroup, and Unisys, Japan.  Sanyo Electric  In 2002, she became an outside director of the board for Sanyo Electric. In 2005, she became chairperson and CEO for Sanyo Electric. Upon her taking chairperson position, she created the new corporation vision 'Think Gaia' and started to restructure many business divisions under the new vision for Sanyo to become a leading company to solve environmental problems with its technology. She created a three-year Evolution Plan aimed at reorganizing the business portfolio and improving the corporate financial structure and conditions. * Sanyo Challenge for the 21st Century In a short time, Sanyo introduced more than ten new Think Gaia (TG) products, and the following four ‚Äúworld-first‚Äù products: 1) Eneloop batteries: rechargeable batteries that can be recharged up to a thousand times. 2) Aqua: a washing machine and dryer that reduces water usage in a wash-cycle from 200 liters to 8 liters by purifying the used water and making air-washing possible through ozone technology. 3) Enegreen: an innovative way to reduce electricity consumption in air- conditioners, refrigerators, and food show-cases in stores and supermarkets. Enegreen absorbs as much CO2 as a forest with an area 130-times larger than the store. 4) Virus-Washer: an air-cleaner that eliminates up to 99 percent of airborne viruses, including avian influenza (bird flu) virus, using a technology that electrolyzes simple tap water. Sanyo underwent drastic restructuring in the first two years and under the three-year Evolution Plan raised the bottom line from red to black, with an operating income of about 750 million dollars and a net profit of around 280 million for the fiscal year ending March 2008. However, under her two year's chairpersonship, Ms. Nonaka constantly fought about how to run the company with board members sent by the main investors insisted that the corporate vision ‚ÄùThink Gaia‚Äù was too ‚Äúnaive‚Äù and ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù to produce the desired profit. It was apparent that the main investors' interest was to make a capital gains by selling their shares not to run manufacturing business. The conflict with the main investors owing the majority of the board led to her resignation as Chairperson of Sanyo in March 2007. 'Think Gaia' vision was also created to shift Sanyo business portfolio in order to make Sanyo profitable by not only to focus on Sanyo's business strength (the most profitable business in the field of solar business and rechargeable batteries, eneloop and hi-brid automobile batteries, as well as the world best technological strength) but also to restructure business unmatched to the 'Think Gaia' vision and money losing business (primarily home electronics business). Ms. Nonaka's vision and intention were never understood by many critics and more so by the main investors at that time. * Time article in April 2007 In November 2008, Panasonic announced to buy Sanyo in order to acquire Sanyo's green business, solar and rechargeable batteries. * Green at the heart of Panasonic's bid for Sanyo * Time article in December 2008  Current Social Activities  \\"The Gaia Initiative\\", a not-for-profit organization was established in 2007 to call not only one corporation, Sanyo, but also wider stakeholders (corporations, citizen, government and NGO/NPO) for solving environmental problems in the world, GAIA.

The flagship Royal Danish Theatre presents drama, opera, ballet and music. Since the 18th century, Danish playwrights have been successful in attracting wide public interest. History It was in the 18th century with the plays of Ludvig Holberg (1684‚Äì1754) that Danish theatre began to prosper. Holberg, sometimes known as the Danish Moli√®re in view of his successful satirical comedies (1722), is considered to be the founder of the Danish theatre. Plays such as Jean de France and Jeppe of the Hill are still performed today.Theatre from Denmark.dk. Retrieved 22 December 2008. Adam Oehlenschl√§ger (1779‚Äì1850) introduced romanticism to the Danish theatre. Especially successful was his Earl Hakon the Mighty, premiered in 1808. The Norwegian Henrik Ibsen (1828‚Äì1906) also travelled to Copenhagen where he produced plays such as A Doll's House (1879). It deals with the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie and a woman‚Äôs struggle to emancipate herself. For Ibsen and his contemporaries, drama was not a question of entertainment but an exercise in critical commentary on the lifestyle of the times.Theatre from Golden Days in Copenhagen . Retrieved 22 December 2008. During this period, the Royal Theatre dominated the scene, but around 1850 other, to some extent more popular, theatres were established, starting with the Casino (1848) where Hans Christian Andersen produced his Ole Luk√∏ie (1850). The Casino became popular for satirical revues in the 1870s. In the 20th century, theatres were established in the large cities √Örhus, Odense and Aalborg as well as several in Copenhagen. Kjeld Abell (1901‚Äì1961), the first Danish modernist playwright, wrote the successful The Melody That Got Lost in 1935 with productions in both Copenhagen and London. Kaj Munk (1898‚Äì1944), a Lutheran pastor, brought religion into his plays. Ordet (The Word) is often said to have been his best work. Carl Erik Soya (1896‚Äì1983) is remembered especially for his anti-Nazi plays such as En G√¶st (A Guest) a satire aimed against the German occupation of Denmark and in 1943, Min Farmors Hus (made into the 1984 film Grandmother's House). Leif Panduro (1923‚Äì1977) wrote a number of plays, some filmed or televised, criticising the middle class, the welfare state and the conflict between normal and abnormal, often questioning the views generally shared by the audience. His I Adams verden (1973) and Louises hus (1974) are among the best Scandinavian television dramas of the 1970s. In recent years, there has been something of a revival in Danish theatre. Many new playwrights and producers have appeared. These include: * Astrid Saalbach (born 1955), winner of the Nordic Drama Award in 2004 for he play End of the World, whose drama Morning and Evening (1993) was also played at the Hampstead Theatre in London; * Peter Asmussen (born 1957), who wrote the film script for Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves as well as numerous radio and television plays and staged dramas. Danish musicals Encouraged by the success of the Danish version of Les Mis√©rables, a number of Danish musicals have been written and performed in Copenhagen and elsewhere. Knud Christensen, commonly known as Sebastian, was particularly successful with Cyrano (1992), based on Rostand's play and Klokkeren fra Notre Dame (The Hunchback of Notre Dame) (2001). Bent Fabricius- Bjerre's musical Matador with lyrics by Clemens Telling based on an earlier, highly successful television series was premiered at the new Copenhagen Opera in June 2007 to full houses.Matador-stjerner er enige: Det bet√∏d alt from Avisen.dk (in Danish).

It runs from Passau to the town of Freyung in the Bavarian Forest. At Kalteneck it forms a junction with the branch line to Eging-Deggendorf. At Waldkirchen the Waldkirchen‚ÄìHaidm√ºhle line branches off towards the Czech border, where since 1945 there has been a junction with the Czech railway network. Course Die Kachlet bridge The Ilztalbahn begins at platform 1a, the so-called Waidlergleis, in Passau Hauptbahnhof. From there it runs to the west over the present-day timetable route (Kursbuchstrecke or KBS) 880, branches off about 2 kilometres to the north and crosses the river Danube on the Kachlet bridge not far from Kachlet power station. Thereafter it climbs into the Bavarian Forest and reaches the valley of the river Ilz behind Tiefenbach. It then follows the Ilz northwards. In the two F√ºrsteneck Tunnels the line leaves the Ilz valley and heads east into the Osterbach valley as far as Waldkirchen. From here it turns north again towards Freyung. In Waldkirchen the 26.9 km long route to Haidm√ºhle via Jandelsbrunn branches off. File:Ilztalbahn Fischhaus.jpgFischhaus File:Ilztalbahn Kalteneck.jpgKalteneck, old station File:Ilztalbahn Fuersteneck.jpgF√ºrsteneck, old station Construction Ilz bridge north of Fischhaus The construction on the Ilztalbahn to Freyung began in 1887, following the granting of the licence on 13 January 1886 and was taken into service on 15 October 1892. The section to R√∂hrnbach was opened earlier, on 6 December 1890. Construction costs were almost 6 million marks. In addition to passenger services the route was mainly intended for the transportation of granite and logs. As a result, in the early years to about 1906, passenger trains were often classed as mixed trains, the so-called \\"goods trains with passenger services\\" (G√ºterz√ºge mit Personenbef√∂rderung) or GmP, which resulted in journey times of up to 3 hours due to shunting movements at the stations en route. Plans to link this railway with the Zwiesel‚ÄìGrafenau line and hence to effect a connexion from Passau as far as Cham, were stymied when the latter was routed close to the town in accordance with the wishes of Grafenau townsfolk. Subsequent plans to build a railway from Grafenau via Sch√∂nberg to F√ºrstenstein from the Deggendorf‚ÄìKalteneck railway, which turned off the Ilztalbahn at Kalteneck, also came to nothing. And hopes expressed during the construction of the narrow gauge railway, the Spiegelau Forest Railway (Spiegelauer Waldbahn) in 1908 from Klingenbrunn via Spiegelau to Mauth, to build a standard gauge line between Mauth and Freyung, did not come to fruition either. Services Due to the low axle load permitted on branch lines, Bavarian Lokalbahn locomotives were employed on the route. For goods traffic, Bavarian BB II tank engines from Passau locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) were usually used. These Mallet locomotives later became the DRG Class 98.7 and were used on the routes to both Freyung and Haidm√ºhle. From the beginning of the 1930s to the start of the Second World War, four- wheeled diesel railbuses of Classes 135 and 137 were also used, together with their respective trailer cars. In addition, there are reports of Class 70 (ex Bavarian Pt 2/3) tank engines being employed. After the line was refurbished and the track and ballast upgraded, Class 64 locomotives took over the running of passenger services and Class 81s handled the goods traffic. Later, diesel engines were also used for the latter and Uerdingen railbuses for the former. 1945 to 1979 The Second World War left its mark on the Ilztalbahn. The Kachlet bridge was blown up on 30 April 1945, the tunnel at Tiefenbach caved in. But from 3 February 1947 the tunnel was usable and from 29 April 1948, after repairs to the bridge, the entire route was open again. From the 1960s, passenger services were mainly delivered by railbuses. On the introduction of the holiday express trains in 1979, even the former Trans-Europ-Express trains came from Dortmund to Freyung during the summer. Closure and decline With the establishment of the Iron Curtain a section of track on the Czech side of the border was removed on the Waldkirchen ‚Äì Haidm√ºhle line. As a result, the importance of this section of route fell quickly, so that only shuttle services were left and all trains just ran from Passau to Freyung. On 26 May 1963 passenger services ceased on the line to Haidm√ºhle. Goods traffic was withdrawn between Haidm√ºhle and Jandelsbrunn on 31 December 1975 and between Jandelsbrunn and Waldkirchen on 1 October 1994. After the track was lifted, the trackbed became the Adalbert Stifter cycle path. From 1980 onwards, traffic on the Ilztalbahn gradually reduced. Sunday services were closed and weekday traffic reduced to four pairs of trains. On 30 April 1982 passenger services were finally withdrawn completely. The reason for the closure of the line was stated as the decrepit state of the Kachlet bridge over the Danube. This bridge was refurbished by November 1982 for 3.6 million DM (1.8 million euros) as was the section of the line as far as Kalteneck for a further 1 million DM (510,000 euros), because the ZF Passau rack railway firm in Patriching near Passau and the Bundeswehr in Freyung continued to generate a lot of goods traffic. For this period of time, goods services were diverted via Deggendorf-Eging-Kalteneck. In the final period up to 2002 only goods trains worked the line, mostly tank transporters for the Bundeswehr (to April 2001) and goods train for the caravan firm of Knaus from Jandelsbrunn and the above-mentioned rack railway company. The termination of the transport contract by the Bundeswehr at Freyung spelt the end of goods services on the line. The only passenger services were occasional specials by the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde, the last one on 5 August 2001.  Reactivation moves  In April 2005 the line was officially closed by the Federal Railway Office (Eisenbahnbundesamt or EBA). Two opposing groups then emerged. One wanted to have a cycle path built on the trackbed, the other pressed for the reactivation of railway services. Both groups have developed detailed plans, but by 2008 it was still unclear which would succeed. Details of the negotiations so far are given at :de: Bahnstrecke Passau‚ÄìFreyung.

Komor (born May 7, 1976) is a Polish-born, Norwegian-raised electronica musician, best known for his collaborative work in Icon of Coil and Zombie Girl. A prolific artist, Komor has also released electronic music under a variety of solo projects and aliases since the late 1990s. Biography Sebastian Komor was born in Zabrze, Poland, in 1976 and moved to Norway in 1981, where he would remain for over twenty years. He first acquired a keyboard in his late teens and released his first music demo in 1992. Throughout the mid- to late-90s Komor created music in Fredrikstad, where an EBM/industrial scene was flourishing under the influence of local bands such as Apoptygma Berzerk. Komor recorded and toured under various band names during that time, starting with Melt and continuing with Area51, Sector9 (which he also used as a remixer alias), and Moonitor. Fellow Fredrikstad musician Andy LaPlegua played keyboards for early Sector9 and Melt shows, and it was this collaboration that led to the formation of Icon of Coil in 1997, with the roles reversed ‚Äì LaPlegua as primary creative member and Komor came in as a full member during the production of the first single \\"Shallow Nation\\". Icon of Coil released their debut single, Shallow Nation, in 2000, at which point Komor became a full-fledged member of the band. Komor and LaPlegua went on to release three full-length albums as IoC: Serenity Is the Devil (2000), The Soul is in the Software (2002), and Machines Are Us (2004). Icon of Coil garnered a fair amount of popularity within the scene, having their albums distributed worldwide and playing a variety of large festivals. During this same time period, Komor and Richard Bj√∏rklund formed the synthpop/EBM band Monofader and released the album Frost in 2004. Sebastian also did drum, sampling and synth programming on an EP titled Fenris for an industrial black metal band called Helheim (note: not the Norwegian black/Viking metal band Helheim). In 2004, however, Komor relocated to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and activity within Icon of Coil and Monofader has been sparse since, with the geographical distance between Komor and his band mates being cited as a roadblock to completing significant amounts of additional music. Komor has stated that newer Monofader material exists, with a speculative title of Everything Changes but the Sea, but that the project is not a priority right now. In 2005 Komor started Zombie Girl with Renee Cooper. They released an EP in 2006 and a full album in 2007 through Alfa Matrix and Metropolis. Komor was also signed to electronic rock label FiXT in 2008 for his solo hard techno/trance/industrial project Squarehead. Two advance Squarehead singles featuring guest vocals were released in 2008 and 2009 with a full-length album, Voltage Controlled Body Music, released in March 2010. Sebastian's long time work-in-progress Moonitor, which he describes as techno/tribal, has now also been signed to FiXT and released an album titled To the Past From the Future in the Present. It appears that both Squarehead and Moonitor were one- off projects with no additional albums currently planned, as Komor has stated that he is now fully focused on another of his oldest projects, Melt. Komor has released production music geared towards film, television, and video game soundtracks through FiXT's sister company Position Music. Yet another active side project of Seb's is Komor Kommando, his dark techno/EBM/aggrotech club- oriented DJ alias. One EP has thus far been released on Alfa Matrix, with a full-length album imminent. Additional solo work has been released through Rasputin Records under his real name. The aforementioned Melt, now rejuvenated after years of being kept on hold by commitments to Icon of Coil, was initially to see an EP called Parasites released in early 2009, but is still a work in progress, with Seb stating \\"I just dont want to hurry a release, this is a very personal album, and I just feel it needs to feel right and complete before its ready to be unleashed\\". Though the name has carried over from work done as early as 1994, all of the current songs being worked on are brand new. Sebastian does production work as Xenomorph Productions. He produced the album Hearts for Bullets by Ayria in 2008. Komor mastered the Depeche Mode tribute album Alfa Matrix Re:Covered in 2009, which included two covers by Komor Kommando. That same year he also mastered fellow Canadian electro-industrial act iVardensphere's debut album Scatterface. In February 2010 Komor released a collection of over 400 audio samples from his studio, some from his released projects and some unused. A second volume followed in June of that same year. Komor is also a visual artist, and designs the artwork for his own releases.

Many of these women have migrated from a rural community to any of Ghana's urban cities in search of work. They generally carry their burdens on their heads. Etymology The term kayayei (singular, kaya yoo) is a compound formed from two languages spoken in Ghana. Kaya means \\"load, luggage, goods or burden\\" in the Hausa language, and yei means \\"women or females\\" in the Ga language,. People in Kumasi refer to the porters as paa o paa. Roleh Kaya have always been manual labourers. They transport goods to and from markets, particularly agricultural goods. Typically, Kaya carry their loads in a large pan placed on their heads, using a moistened coil of cloth as a buffer, see Head-carrying. Conditions Kaya Yei still toil away in markets in Ghana today, often in poor conditions and with minimal income. Occasionally, Kaya are brought into private homes to perform domestic tasks, where they may earn slightly more. The Kaya are often transient, and often without basic sanitation. Basic hygiene & nutrition conditions are also poor. In larger cities such as Accra & Kumasi, Kaya are often migrants from remote regions who have come to the cities in search for better employment prospects. In May 2016, the Minister for Gender, Children and Social Protection Nana Oye Lithur ensured that over 1,000 kayayei from Agbogbloshie and Mallam Atta markets in Accra were registered onto the National Health Insurance Scheme, to help provide them access to basic healthcare service.

Although one million copies of the new rules were printed by 1944 for school use, the reform was never introduced. Their preparation was initiated by the Reich Education Minister Bernhard Rust and they were drawn up by Otto Basler, Erich Gierach and Karl Reumuth. Among the key changes were: * optional changes to the spelling of words of foreign origin to remove non- German combinations, e.g. Filosof for Philosoph meaning philosopher * the removal of the third consonant in all groups of three consecutive consonants resulting from the combination of two words, e.g. Sauerstoffflasche to Sauerstofflasche. * division of words at the end of a line according to the spoken syllables (wa-rum, da-r√ºber, Fens-ter) * the disappearance of the comma before main clauses introduced by und or oder. On the orders of Hitler, the introduction of the new rules in schools, which had been planned for the start of the 1944‚Äì45 school year, was postponed as it was considered \\"not important for the war effort\\". Otto Basler produced a slightly revised version of the rulebook in 1948, but the innovations contained in it were not implemented. Some of the proposed changes, such as the comma before the conjunction und becoming optional and the hyphenation changes, were included in the German spelling reform of 1996. Some of Rust's proposed spellings could be found in the dictionary up to the 1980s, such as the spelling Kautsch.

This differs greatly from downstream not only in theory and usage, but also in that upstream speeds are usually at a premium. Whereas downstream speed is important to the average home user for purposes of downloading content, uploads are used mainly for web server applications and similar processes where the sending of data is critical. Upstream speeds are also important to users of peer-to-peer software. Residential services often have higher downstream rates than upstream, while business services are often symmetric. ADSL and cable modems are asymmetric, with the upstream data rate much lower than that of its downstream. Symmetric connections such as Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL) and T1, however, offer identical upstream and downstream rates. If a node A on the Internet is closer (fewer hops away) to the Internet backbone than a node B, then A is said to be upstream of B or conversely, B is downstream of A. Related to this is the idea of upstream providers. An upstream provider is usually a large ISP that provides Internet access to a local ISP.

Life He was born in Roermond, and was a pupil of Alexander Hegius von Heek in Deventer. From 1496 to 1500 he was at the University of Cologne. Then with the support of Rudolph von Langen he was brought in as assistant head of the cathedral school at M√ºnster. After friction with the head, he moved to another school there, reforming textbooks and promoting the teaching of Greek.Peter G. Bietenholz, Thomas Brian Deutscher, Contemporaries of Erasmus: A Biographical Register of the Renaissance and Reformation (2003), p. 470. Pupils travelled from distant parts of Europe to study with him.http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07538b.htm He was then school rector in Alkmaar from 1513, where he insisted his pupils had a good reading knowledge of parts of the Bible.Alastair Duke, Reformation and Revolt in the Low Countries (2003), pp. 13-3. The marauding Arumer Zwarte Hoop sacked Alkmaar in late June 1517, leaving Murmellius destitute. Nowadays, a school in Alkmaar is named after him as the Murmellius Gymnasium. He moved on to Zwolle, briefly working under Gerardus Listrius, and then to a position at Deventer. He died suddenly in early October 1517, giving rise to an unsubstantiated rumour that Listrius had poisoned him. Works Around 50 works of his are known, mostly written with pedagogical intent. He published an edition of the Consolation of Philosophy of Boethius in 1511, followed in 1514 by a commentary.Lodi Nauta, A Humanist Reading of Boethius's Consolatio Philosophiae, p. 318, in Lodi Nauta, Arie Johan Vanderjagt (editors), Between Demonstration and Imagination: Essays in the History of Science and Philosophy Presented to John D.

Ford was born in De Soto, Missouri, and was raised in Little Rock, Arkansas. He had only a third-grade education, so he joked that he came from the \\"university of hard knocks\\". He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1918. During his Navy service he learned to play the banjo and earned his nickname Whitey Ford because of his blond hair. After his discharge in 1922, he joined McGinty's Oklahoma Cowboy Band, a Dixieland jazz group, as a banjo player. The group later changed its name to Otto Gray and his Oklahoma Cowboys and appeared in a few Hollywood film shorts. In 1929, Ford made his debut on WLS-AM in Chicago, Illinois. In the early 1930s, while working at KWK in St. Louis, Ford took the stage name The Duke of Paducah. In 1937, he founded the Renfro Valley Barn Dance with Red Foley and John Lair. More radio work followed when he became a regular on Plantation Party, an NBC Radio show in Cincinnati and Chicago. From 1942-1959, Ford was a regular on the Grand Ole Opry where he became a member. He also hosted several popular radio shows broadcast nationally. In the mid-1950s, Ford toured with a troupe he called the Rock and Roll Revue. On several occasions, he shared a bill with Elvis Presley. In 1958, he began hosting an early morning television show, Country Junction, on WLAC-TV in Nashville, which he hosted for several years, being succeeded by disc jockey Eddie Hill. Ford ended his act with his tagline: \\"I'm goin' back to the wagon, boys, these shoes are killin' me.\\" He was elected to the Country Music Hall of Fame in February 1986.

Piccolo The Piccolo. The piccolo is the highest-pitched member of the flute family, with a range an octave above that of the concert flute. It is usually the highest-pitched instrument within orchestras and bands. The piccolo has a stereotype for being difficult to play in tune; its small size makes it difficult to construct an evenly tuned scale. Treble flute The Myall-Allen G Treble Flute. The treble flute is pitched in the key of G, a fifth above the concert flute. The instrument is rare today, only occasionally found in flute choirs or private collections. Soprano flute This distinctive sounding instrument is rarely found at present. A few American publications for flute choir currently include a part for an E (soprano) flute, an instrument pitched a minor third higher than the standard C flute. In these publications, an alternative part is provided either for the C flute or for the piccolo. Concert flute Concert flute in use. The standard concert flute is by far the most common member of the flute family. The flute is used in many ensembles including concert bands, orchestras, flute ensembles, occasionally jazz bands and big bands. The instrument is pitched in C and has a range of just over three octaves starting from the musical note C4 (corresponding to middle C on the piano), however, some experienced flautists are able to reach C8. Many professional flutes have a longer B-foot joint, which can reach B3. Fl√ªte d'amour The fl√ªte d'amour or flauto d'amore is pitched in A, A, or B and is intermediate in size between the modern C concert flute and the alto flute in G. It is the mezzo-soprano, tenor or countertenor member of the flute family. It is sometimes referred to as a tenor flute. The range of the instrument is from G3 to E7. The B version is usually used for jazz because both the tenor saxophone and clarinet are in B. Alto flute The alto flute. The alto flute is characterized by its distinct, mellow tone in the lower portion of its range. The tube of the alto flute is considerably thicker and longer than a C flute and requires more breath from the player. However, this gives it a greater dynamic presence in the bottom octave and a half of its range. It is pitched in the key of G (sounding a fourth lower than written) with its range stretching from G3 to G6. The headjoint may be straight or curved. Bass flute The bass flute is pitched in the key of C, and one octave below the concert flute. Because of the length of its tube (approximately ), it is usually made with a curved headjoint, sometimes in a \\"J\\" shape, to bring the embouchure hole within reach of the player. It is usually only used in flute choirs, as it is easily drowned out by other instruments of comparable register, such as the clarinet. Contra-alto flute The contra-alto flute (also called contrabass flute in G) is in the key of G, pitched one octave below the alto flute, and a fourth below the bass flute. It is so large that the instrument's body is held vertically, with an adjustable floor peg similar to that of the bass clarinet. Contrabass flute 150px The contrabass flute (sometimes also called octobass flute) is used mostly in flute ensembles. Its range is similar to that of the regular concert flute, except that it is pitched two octaves lower; the lowest performable note is C2 (equivalent to the lowest C on the cello). Many contrabass flutes in C are also equipped with a low B1 (in the same manner as many modern standard sized flutes are). The contra-alto flute is sometimes referred to as a contrabass flute in G. Subcontrabass flute 150px An instrument in the key of G, pitched a fourth below the contrabass flute in C and two octaves below the alto flute in G; it is sometimes also called a double contra-alto flute. Double contrabass flute 150px The double contrabass flute (sometimes also called octobass flute) is pitched in the key of C, three octaves below the concert flute (two octaves below the bass flute, and one octave below the contrabass flute). Its lowest note is C1, one octave below the cello's lowest C. Despite the tendency of the larger sizes of flute to be quiet, the double contrabass flute has a surprisingly powerful tone, though it benefits from amplification in ensembles. Hyperbass flute Roberto Fabbriciani with hyperbass flute. The hyperbass flute is the largest and lowest instrument in the flute family. It is pitched in C, four octaves below the concert flute (and three octaves below the bass flute, two octaves below the contrabass flute, and one octave below the double contrabass flute). It is made of PVC and wood, its tubing is over in length and its lowest note is C0 (16 Hz), below what is generally considered the range of human hearing. The only known example of the instrument is a prototype built for Italian flautist Roberto Fabbriciani by Francesco Romei, a Florentine craftsman.

During the 18th and at the beginning of the 19th century, four ferries crossed the Aare river between Bern and Thun. Increasing freight traffic from local farms at the beginning of the 19th century necessitated a bridge in the Hunzigenau. Construction of the Hunzigenbr√ºcke began in the spring of 1835 and was completed by the summer of 1836. Construction of the N6 national road through the Aare river valley required a connection to the cantonal highway between the districts of Konolfingen and Seftigen. This would have increased the river crossing traffic beyond the old wooden bridge's capacity, so a new concrete bridge was built and after 136 years the wooden bridge became superfluous. After much discussion, the bridge was moved to Auguet. The bridge was renamed Auguetbr√ºcke and opened to the public as a footbridge in 1974. A commemorative plaque on the bridge reads \\"Hunzigenbr√ºcke erbaut 1835 in der Hunzigenau. Versetzt und restauriert 1973-74 / Umbenannt in Auguetbrugg.

From 1933 until the beginning of the war in 1939, the Bardach family lived in Rawa Ruska; then, moved to Lwow, where under Soviet occupation Witold began his studies as sculptor at the Institute of Fine Arts under Prof. Marian Wnuk. In 1941 the Germans occupied Lwow and a year later his entire family, who had lived there for generations, was killed. Bardach escaped to Warsaw where he first worked for a photographer and later as an employee of the Junkers factory at Okecie Airport (Warsaw Chopin Airport), secretly removing Luftwaffe radio-transmitters for delivery to the underground Home Army (Armia Krajowa). In order to escape from the Gestapo at 18 years old, he took on the name ‚ÄúEugene (Eugeniusz) Gutowski‚Äù and left Warsaw for Riga, Latvia where he became the head of a construction company working for the Organization Todt. He was later evacuated to Germany at the end of 1944.

Captain Alexander Waugh Gutowski had one children Jordan Waugh born in Saskatchewan, Canada September 17th 1979. =Film career= After working for a few years as fashion illustrator, Gene Gutowski entered the film and TV industry, working as a production manager on a couple of episodes of the mid-1950s TV series I Spy which featured Raymond Massey in the lead role. He moved to London in 1960 to produce Station Six Sahara released in 1962. It was there that he joined forces with Roman Polanski in 1963. In a fruitful creative partnership they made Repulsion (1965), Cul-de-sac (1966) and The Fearless Vampire Killers (1967), until Polanski moved to Hollywood under contract to Paramount in 1967. In 1970 Gutowski wrote the script for and produced The Adventures of Gerard, directed by Jerzy Skolimowski, and then produced A Day at the Beach (1970), another Polanski feature, and Romance of a Horsethief (1971). Remaining close friends over the years, Gutowski and Polanski joined forces again to produce together The Pianist (2002), which won multiple Oscars. Gutowski staged several plays, including Passion Flower Hotel (1965), Death and the Maiden (1992) and Doubt: A Parable (2007). In 2004, his Polish autobiography Od Holocaustu do Hollywood (From Holocaust to Hollywood), was published. An English-language edition under the title With Balls and Chutzpah: A Story of Survival was issued in the U.S. in 2011. In 2014, his son, the Hollywood-based filmmaker/producer Adam Bardach, made a documentary biopic \\"Dancing Before the Enemy: How a Teenage Boy Fooled the Nazis and Lived (M√≥j tata Gene Gutowski)\\".

It was originally published in The Strand Magazine (April 1903), and then included in the Twelve Stories and a Dream story collection, in 1903.See ISFDB listing in #External links It has been frequently reprinted. Plot summary The repellently fat Mr. Pyecraft is a patron of a London club, who usually pesters Mr. Formalyn, to the point that the latter eventually decides to write Pyecraft's true story, for revealing an unbelievable, yet embarrassing, secret which is shared by both. In the beginning of Formalyn's account, the rotund Pyecraft usually annoys him, with his boring stories and particularly about his obesity troubles. Eventually, Formalyn brings an occult weight-loss recipe of his Hindustani great-grandmother, and Pyecraft tries it for some time. Then, Pyecraft telegraphs Formalyn at the club, calling him to Pyecraft's house in Bloomsbury, where the housekeeper tells him that Pyecraft has been cloistered in his own living room for the last twenty-four hours. There, he is found, as rounded as ever, floating helplessly in the air, against the ceiling. They conclude that the recipe has literally reduced his weight, not his fatness. Formalyn assists with various ingenious devices and techniques to allow Pyecraft to traverse his room while floating. For example, Pyecraft gets down from the bookcase by taking out a couple of heavy tomes of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Some time later, it occurs to Formalyn that Pyecraft's garments could be stuffed with heavy lead pieces to keep him on the ground; he even remarks that Pyecraft could sail without fear of a shipwreck, for he could just hover ashore after removing some of the weight. Pyecraft returns to the club with Formalyn's assistance, though without change to his porcine habits. Initially, the two of them agree to keep the embarrassing secret of Pyecraft's weightlessness, but the obsessive Pyecraft soon starts to annoy him too much.

Despite his value as general, during his reign Venice lost Dalmatia. He was blind from one eye after a wound received in battle. Biography Coat of arms of Giovanni Dolfin He was born in Venice into one of the most ancient, noble and wealthy families of the city, as the son of Gregorio Delfin. The Dolfin family was allied with the Gradenigo, with whom they shared a common origin. Since the aristocratic coup of 1297, the Dolfin and the Gradenigo where among the favourites to occupy the ducal throne, and so they did, one after the other (Giovanni Dolfin's brother in law, Giovanni Gradenigo was doge before him). Dolfin was elected while defending Treviso, then besieged by Hungarian troops; being denied safe passage by his enemies, he broke the encirclement and reached Venice to be enthroned. In the war which had broken out under Dolfin's predecessor, Hungary under King Louis I had conquered Dalmatia and was pushing other Venetian colonies to revolt. The Venetian defeat at Nervesa in February 1358 forced the Republic to sue for peace. In the resulting Treaty of Zadar the Venetians lost Dalmatia, Zara and Split, but maintained their naval predominance in the Adriatic Sea as the King of Hungary accepted not to build a fleet of his own. Also in 1358‚Äì1359 Padua started to menace the Venetian trades on the Brenta River and forced the city to stop trading with Egypt. These events triggered an economical crisis in Venice, which ended only after the War of Chioggia, in 1382. Tome of the Doge in Venice Doge Giovanni Dolfin died in 1361 and was buried in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges. His funerary monument is still visible today, showing the coat of arms of the noble Dolfin family. In fiction The plot of Donna Leon's 2000 Detective Mystery novel Friends in High Places, set in contemporary Venice, involves present-day (fictional) descendants of the Dolfin Family, who are inordinately proud of their descent from the 13th Century Doge (and who have little else to be proud of).

Relations between the two countries existed since the Korean War, but however have evolved into conflicts. History  The Second Hungarian Republic recognized the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on November 11, 1948 as the sole legal sovereign entity of the entire Korea. Following the Korean War, the DPRK sent a number of its veterans to Hungary as exchange students. When the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 began, roughly 200 of these students joined in; their war experience proved to be of aid to the Hungarian students, many of whom lacked military training and could not operate the weapons and equipment they captured. In the aftermath of the revolution, Soviet forces and Hungarian police gathered up the North Korean students--easily distinguished from locals by their appearance--and deported them back to the DPRK, with a few escaping to Austria.http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2008/08/01/the-usas-first- naturalized-north-korean/ In 1988, Kim Jong-il's brother Kim Pyong-il was assigned to Hungary as the DPRK's ambassador. However, little more than a year later, Hungary would become the first Eastern Bloc nation to open relations with South Korea; in response, the DPRK withdrew Kim from Hungary and sent him to Bulgaria instead. They angrily referred to the Hungarian decision as a \\"betrayal\\", and then expelled the Hungarian envoy to Pyongyang, Mikl√≥s Lengyel. This led to a downturn in bilateral ties which lasted over a decade- and-a-half; in a 2004 interview with The Korea Herald, then-deputy State Secretary G√°bor Szentiv√°nyi indicated that his government were interested in improving their relations with the North. However, as of 2009, the former Hungarian embassy building in Pyongyang remained empty; Budapest's relations with Pyongyang are handled through their embassy in Beijing, though according to Lengyel, who since became Hungary's ambassador to South Korea, there were plans of transferring the responsibility for that relationship to him. In 2002, it emerged that a former North Korean diplomat in Budapest had been involved in international arms trafficking while in Hungary.

The Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC) operates nine Crown Assets Distribution Centres (CADC) located across the country which manage the disposal of moveable federal government surplus material. Acting as the Government of Canada's agent, PWGSC provides client departments with a disposal service through direct sales or through the management of contracts with service providers. History In 1944, the Government of Canada created the War Assets Corporation, which was subsequently renamed the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation. In 1984, the activities and staff of the Corporation were integrated into the Department of Supply and Services. The organization became known as the Crown Assets Distribution Service Line and has continued its functions within Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC). Its mandate is to manage the surplus moveable assets disposal program for the government, providing quality service to clients while obtaining best value for the Crown. The legislative base for its operations is the Surplus Crown Assets Act along with the Treasury Board Policy on the Disposal of Surplus Moveable Crown Assets. With a few exceptions, the legislation and policy require PWGSC to manage the disposal of surplus assets on behalf of federal organizations. For over 60 years, CADCs have been involved in the direct sale of surplus materiel ranging from ships and cars to furniture and clothing, as well as seized goods on behalf of federal government departments and agencies. Surplus assets are sold directly by CAD or through contracted service providers. Many assets are sold through public sales that attract thousands of buyers, and, in some cases, sales are conducted at CADC warehouses located in Montreal, Halifax and Ottawa. In addition, many transactions also take place through the CAD Web site, where each item is listed and described, often accompanied by a photo. The site receives over 50,000 visitors per month. CADCs also act as agents for foreign governments in the sale of their surplus assets located in Canada and have working arrangements with certain European governments for disposal of Canadian military surplus located in their countries. The process Departments or federal bodies notify CAD of their surplus assets by filling out a Report of Surplus form and sending it to the nearest CADC. CAD then handles all aspects of asset disposal from start to finish. The process can include: organizing sales of assets; arranging for viewing of assets; conducting sales; evaluating bids; receiving money; handling all sales-related inquiries; and returning net proceeds to clients. Once the item is sold, the client receives the net proceeds from the sale and a transaction report. Agencies which sells government surplus * Nine CADCs across Canada. * Competitively selected private sector service providers. * CADCs acting as agents for foreign governments seeking to dispose of their surplus items located in Canada. * Agency agreements with service providers abroad. How surplus is sold * Public sales: ** advertised in the media, specifying details of location, commodities on sale and inspection times; ** goods are inspected on site; ** sealed bids are deposited in a secure bid box on site; ** after sale closing, offers are tabulated and the successful bidders are notified. * Regular Sales: ** potential buyers registered with CAD receive electronic notification of the availability of assets of interest and may view assets for sale on the CAD web site and obtain an Offer to Purchase form; ** in some cases, Offers to Purchase are mailed out to interested bidders who have made their interest in specific commodities known to CAD; ** goods are available for inspection for a specified period as noted on the Offer to Purchase form; ** completed Offer to Purchase form must be returned to CAD by the specified closing date and time; ** after the closing date, sealed offers are opened and the successful bidders are notified. * Sales through contracted service providers such as the National Master Standing Offer for vehicles and other contracts: ** contractors effect sales on behalf of clients.

Established in 1966 by West Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek, it has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the city's budget and established parks, gardens, forests, recreational sites, theaters, and museums; restored ancient sites, synagogues, mosques, and churches; funded community and social centers, preschool centers, and health clinics; and sponsored archeological excavations, scholarships, and cultural events. The Jerusalem Foundation is unique in its structure and mission, as it funds municipal projects with private donations from international sources. History When Kollek became mayor of Jerusalem in 1965, it was a divided city, separated into Arab and Jewish sectors as a result of the 1949 Armistice Agreements. One of Kollek's objectives for The Jerusalem Foundation was to use it to build world Jewry's support for the development of Jewish Jerusalem. At the same time, the city suffered from poverty and overcrowding, with much of the population living in housing projects. Hardly any neighborhoods had a park or playground. The Jerusalem Foundation's first initiative was the establishment of public parks in a few of the city's poorest neighborhoods, with funds donated by New York supporters. Since its inception, the Foundation has furnished playgrounds and flower gardens for nearly every Jerusalem neighborhood, contributing 350 out of the more than 1,000 parks, gardens and green spaces in the city. Politically, Kollek viewed the Foundation as a tool for pushing projects past a city council that was unable or unwilling to support them. Kollek also leveraged matching funds from the municipality, government ministries, and non-governmental organizations for Foundation projects. Henry Crown Symphony Hall While the Foundation is chaired by the mayor of Jerusalem, it is independent of the Finance Ministry and state-related charities such as the Jewish Agency and World Zionist Organization. From the donors' point of view, this means more transparency for their contributions. Unlike state-sponsored charities like the United Jewish Appeal, for example, in which donations are funneled directly into Finance Ministry coffers, donors know exactly what they are supporting with their contributions to The Jerusalem Foundation. This transparency has given the name to such projects as the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens, the Walter and Elise Haas Promenade, the Vivienne and Maurice Wohl Rose Park, and the Rebecca Crown Auditorium and Henry Crown Symphony Hall at the Jerusalem Theater, among many others. The Jerusalem Foundation became a model for the Tel Aviv Foundation, which Tel Aviv mayor Shlomo Lahat established in 1977 upon the advice of Kollek. Similar models have been established by other Israeli cities. Organizational structure The President of the Jerusalem Foundation in Israel is Shai Doron, formerly the Director General of the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens and the head of Mayor Teddy Kollek's office during his last term. The organizational structure of The Jerusalem Foundation includes a General Assembly staffed by leading business and academic figures in Jerusalem and around the world. The General Assembly meets biannually to discuss the financial outlays and work plan of the Foundation. It also elects the members of the Board of Directors, which convenes every four to six weeks to supervise activities in the areas of overseas/fundraising, projects, technical and finance. The Jerusalem Foundation's Israeli leadership can be found here, and leadership can be found here. The Jerusalem Foundation is politically unaffiliated. Based in Jerusalem, it maintains fund-raising desks in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Canada. It holds regular fundraising events in major Jewish centers. It has awarded its Teddy Kollek Award annually since 1999 to those who have \\"made outstanding contributions to advancing the social, cultural, educational, and physical development of the city of Jerusalem\\". Founding president Ruth Cheshin served in this capacity from 1966 to 2011. She was succeeded in October 2011 by Mark Sofer, a former Israeli ambassador to Ireland and India followed by Yohanna Arbib-Perugia. Nir Barkat, while mayor of Jerusalem, was an honorary chairman of The Jerusalem Foundation, and Israeli politician Sallai Meridor is the international chairman. Revenues Between 1966 and 1980, revenue from The Jerusalem Foundation accounted for 16 to 20 percent of the municipal budget. Between 1966 and 1991, The Jerusalem Foundation contributed $245 million to the city's development. Between 1991 and 1996, its income from contributions was estimated at $20 million per year. In the early 2000s, this figure increased to $30 million per year.Auerbach and Sharkansky (2007), p. 19. In 2011 revenue was $25 million. The Jerusalem Foundation's 2010 annual report stated that it has raised over $800 million between 1966 and 2010. The Jerusalem Foundation's Annual Reports can be found on its website here. Projects As of 2018 The Jerusalem Foundation has funded over 4,000 projects. It has built many gardens, parks and woodlands throughout the city, as well as recreational sites. It has sponsored restorations of ancient and historic sites - notably the Jewish Quarter in the Old City - and renovated synagogues, mosques, and churches. It has funded community and social centers, preschool centers, and health clinics; provided studios and housing for visiting artists and intellectuals; and sponsored archeological excavations, scholarships, artists workshops, and a wide variety of cultural events. The Jerusalem Foundation has also contributed to Arab neighborhoods, though not to the same extent as Jewish ones. As mayor, Kollek often solicited overseas donors through The Jerusalem Foundation to pay for projects in the Arab sector that the city could not sponsor and the national government refused to fund. The Jerusalem Foundation sponsored the Sheikh Jarrah Health Centre, \\"a Beit Hanina sports field, playgrounds in several Arab neighborhoods, and improvements at Abdallah Ibn Hussein Technology School, which enabled the school to become an accredited technical college\\".Berger and Ahimeir (2002), p. 408. It also sponsored Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel, which promotes coexistence between Jews and Arabs. =Flagship projects= The Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum.

An B√≥thar Bu√≠ Verified 2011-02-09. is a village in North West County Cork, Ireland. The village is in the civil parish of Kilmeen in the Barony of Duhallow, and spans the townlands of Gneeves, Laharan and Derrynatubbrid.http://boherbue.com/location.html Boherbue is within the Cork North-West D√°il constituency. History The exact time period for the first permanent settlement in the area in not known. It has been suggested that the first inhabitants of the area were probably nomadic due to the amount of 'forts and bailes' that have are recorded in the area. Other ancient monuments in the area, as listed in the Record of Monuments and Places, include several ringforts and fulacht fiadh. A permanent settlement was described as early as 1655 in William Petty‚Äôs map of County Cork. In the 17th century the wider areas of Pobal U√≠ Chaoimh and Sliabh Luachra were being opened up by the construction of roadways, which facilitated the movement of cattle and general economic growth. During this time a roadway from Kanturk to Killarney was constructed which passed through present day Boherbue. Down Survey of Ireland circa 1656 Origin of name Several theories exist as to how the area came to be known as B√≥thar Bu√≠. B√≥thar Bu√≠ literally translated from Irish means ‚Äòyellow road‚Äô, and many maintain that the name comes from the yellow mud that used to come to the surface of the road in times of rain. Another theory suggests that the name comes the pagan god or chief Druid Bao√≠, who is said to have lived in the area. Yet another explanation is that name originates from the abundant yellow gorse bushes (known locally as ‚Äòfurze‚Äô) that grow in the area. Transport and economy Boherbue lies on the R577 road, linking Tralee and Mallow. The nearest airport is Kerry Airport (37 km away). The closest rail link to Boherbue is Millstreet (12 km) and Banteer (15 km) train stations, Mallow train station (32 km away) is popular in the area because of the frequent Cork-Dublin services from there. Employers in the area include Ingredients Solutions (a cheese factory).http://boherbueheritage.com/chapter-9.html Education Boherbue Educare (a pre-school and creche) is located in the townland of Gneeves. At primary level, local children are educated at Boherbue National School which is on the Knocknagree road (L1108). The local second level school is Boherbue Comprehensive School which lies to the east of the village and has approximately 45 teachers and 360 pupils. Religion The original parish church was situated evidently where Kilmeen graveyard is today. The present parish church is situated in the east end of the village. It is a modern building, erected in 1969 by local contractor Christy Feehan and blessed and opened by the then Bishop of Kerry, Dr Moynihan, on 29 April 1969. Sport Boherbue's main sport is Gaelic Football represented by Boherbue GAA club with the football field situated in Gneeves at the western end of the village on the Knocknagree road. (L1108) As of 2018 Boherbue juvenile footballers have merged with Knocknagree to form BK Plunketts, the name Plunkett is of honour of the founder of the Co-operative movement Horace Plunkett. Boherbue is also represented in Ladies Football, Boherbue LFC used to represent the area until they merged with the Ballydesmond and Kiskeam club Araglin Desmonds, therefore renaming Araglin Desmonds Bu√≠ to represent Boherbue.

A native of Connecticut , he lived in Ohio and Illinois before taking the Oregon Trail west to Oregon where he started a nursery and later raised livestock and grew flax. At times a Republican and later a Democrat, he served in the Oregon House of Representatives and as the clerk for the county. He was related to both Homer Davenport and T. T. Geer. Early life Ralph C. Geer was born to Joseph Carey Geer, Sr. and Mary Johnson Geer on March 13, 1816 in Willimantic, Connecticut, a former city now located in the town of Windham in Windham County, Connecticut. The family moved to Madison County, Ohio, when he was still a boy.Marion County Record, January 11, 1895, 8:3. On January 8, 1837, he married Mary Catherine Willard in London, Ohio and later moved to Farmington in Knox County, Illinois. In 1847, Geer and his family immigrated to the Oregon Country over the Oregon Trail. The couple had six children in all with two of them born in Oregon. Mary Geer was born September 8, 1851 and the youngest of them Angeline, was born on October 8, 1853 dying at two and half years of age on March 23, 1856. Geer settled east of Salem in the Waldo Hills and began building a nursery using the apple and pear seedlings he carried with him across the plains to Oregon. Geer spent time as a teacher, imported English sheep to Oregon in 1858, and was a pioneer of flax growing in the Willamette Valley. Cayuse War The Whitman Massacre contributed greatly to the environment that resulted into what is known as the Cayuse War with Native Americans. Several companies of men were organized in response to the war and in 1848 Geer served as Captain of one assigned to protecting the Willamette Valley. In March of that year, he led his troops into the Battle of Abiqua Creek. Political career In 1854, he was elected to the Oregon Territorial Legislature to represent Marion County. He served during the 1854 to 1855 session in the lower House of Representatives. In July 1868 he was elected Clerk of Marion County and served a single twoyear term, leaving office in June 1870.

When they were introduced they were the first locomotives in Britain to use the 0-8-2 wheel arrangement. History The genesis of the class was in the four earlier Class D 0-8-0 tender locomotives. These had been purchased from Sharp Stewart, who had originally built them for the Swedish & Norwegian Railway. One attractive feature of these locomotives had been their short overall length, due to their diminutive four-wheeled tenders. This made them unusually short for their power, suitable for the Barry Railway's restrictively short turntables, and their resultant limited range was not an issue for the short journeys of the Welsh mineral traffic. When the Barry Railway had need of more locomotives for coal trains on the Vale of Glamorgan Line it returned to Sharp Stewart, who had also supplied most of the locos on the railway, for similar engines to the Class D. The result was the Class H 0-8-2T, which had the same small driving wheels to give a high tractive effort, and were heavy (for the time) giving good braking. They were built as tank locomotives, with an additional rear pony truck, which allowed a coal and water capacity greater than that of the small Class D tender, whilst also being shorter and not requiring the use of turntables. Seven locomotives were delivered in 1896, and numbered 79‚Äì85, the numbers being carried on an oval plate attached to the side tanks. Once delivered however, the Class H locos were employed in hauling heavy coal trains between Barry Docks and the large yard at Cadoxton, and in this way they spent their working lives. With the grouping in 1922, the Barry Railway became part of the Great Western Railway which renumbered the locos 1380‚Äì1386, placing the new numbers on the bunker behind the cab door, and designating them 1380 class in the GWR records. Improvements were made to numbers 1380 and 1383 at Swindon Works including GW pattern safety bonnets, enlarged bunkers, new buffers and an extended smokebox, the changes adding an extra ton to the loco weight. At the same time the boiler pressure on these two locos was raised by with the tractive effort also being increased appropriately. Despite this the locos were non-standard in GWR terms, and were all scrapped between 1925 and 1930.

Given any two graph-like structures, e.g. classifications, taxonomies database or XML schemas and ontologies, matching is an operator which identifies those nodes in the two structures which semantically correspond to one another. For example, applied to file systems it can identify that a folder labeled \\"car\\" is semantically equivalent to another folder \\"automobile\\" because they are synonyms in English. This information can be taken from a linguistic resource like WordNet. In the recent years many of them have been offered. S-Match is an example of a semantic matching operator. It works on lightweight ontologies, namely graph structures where each node is labeled by a natural language sentence, for example in English. These sentences are translated into a formal logical formula (according to an artificial unambiguous language) codifying the meaning of the node taking into account its position in the graph. For example, in case the folder \\"car\\" is under another folder \\"red\\" we can say that the meaning of the folder \\"car\\" is \\"red car\\" in this case. This is translated into the logical formula \\"red AND car\\". The output of S-Match is a set of semantic correspondences called mappings attached with one of the following semantic relations: disjointness (‚ä•), equivalence (‚â°), more specific (‚äë) and less specific (‚äí). In our example the algorithm will return a mapping between \\"car\\" and \\"automobile\\" attached with an equivalence relation. Information semantically matched can also be used as a measure of relevance through a mapping of near-term relationships. Such use of S-Match technology is prevalent in the career space where it is used to gauge depth of skills through relational mapping of information found in applicant resumes. Semantic matching represents a fundamental technique in many applications in areas such as resource discovery, data integration, data migration, query translation, peer to peer networks, agent communication, schema and ontology merging. Its use is also being investigated in other areas such as event processing.Hasan, Souleiman, Sean O'Riain, and Edward Curry. 2012. \\"Approximate Semantic Matching of Heterogeneous Events.\\" In 6th ACM International Conference on Distributed Event-Based Systems (DEBS 2012), 252‚Äì263. Berlin, Germany: ACM. \\"DOI\\". In fact, it has been proposed as a valid solution to the semantic heterogeneity problem, namely managing the diversity in knowledge. Interoperability among people of different cultures and languages, having different viewpoints and using different terminology has always been a huge problem. Especially with the advent of the Web and the consequential information explosion, the problem seems to be emphasized. People face the concrete problem to retrieve, disambiguate and integrate information coming from a wide variety of sources.

Origins and activities The most recent incarnation of the quartet was formed in the year 2000, while studying at the Walter Stauffer Academy in Cremona with Salvatore Accardo, Rocco Filippini, and Bruno Giuranna. The ensemble, with the current members since 2002, continued their studies with Piero Farulli of the Quartetto Italiano at the Fiesole School of Music and with Hatto Beyerle of the Alban Berg Quartet. The group have since made a name for itself as one of the most interesting chamber ensembles on the international scene. It has performed at major international festivals in Europe, South America, Australia and the United States such as the Beethovenfest in Bonn, Bozar Festival in Brussels, Festival of Turku, Kammermusik Gemeinde in Hannover, Perth Festival in Australia, and in the most prestigious concert halls all over the world such as the Konzerthaus in Berlin, Wigmore Hall in London, Barge Music in New York, and Beethovenhaus in Bonn. Since 2011 Quartetto di Cremona has been Artist-in- residence at the Societ√† del Quartetto in Milan for projects which include concerts and collaborations that culminated in 2014 with the complete performance of the Beethoven quartets, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the institution. Beginning in 2012 the ensemble was also Artist-in-residence at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome. International critics have noted the artistic and interpretative qualities of the Quartetto di Cremona. Following a concert at the Wigmore Hall, the British magazine The Strad wrote \\"Dynamic contouring was as sleek and elegant as an Armani suit, and it tailored the music to perfection.\\" In Australia, the quartet was acclaimed as the \\"glory of the Perth Festival\\" and the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung described them as ‚Äúone of the most exciting quartets of the current generation.‚Äù Radio and television stations around the world (such as RAI, WDR, BBC, VRT, SDR, ABC) regularly broadcast the Quartetto di Cremona concerts in repertoire ranging from the early works of Haydn to contemporary music, particularly works of Fabio Vacchi, Lorenzo Ferrero, Helmut Lachenmann, and Silvia Colasanti. The group collaborates with world-renowned artists such as Bruno Giuranna, Massimo Quarta, Enrico Dindo, Carbonare Alessandro, Andrea Lucchesini, Pietro de Maria, Gloria Campaner, Angela Hewitt, Ivo Pogorelich, Lilya Zilberstein, C√©dric Tiberghien, and Pieter Wispelwey. An important part of the activity is teaching masterclasses throughout Europe. In autumn 2011 the quartet was appointed to the Chair of the String quartet program at the Walter Stauffer Academy in Cremona. Notable recordings include the complete string quartets by Fabio Vacchi, which were released in April 2011 by Decca. For their recordings of the complete string quartets by Beethoven (Audite), the Quartetto di Cremona was awarded the ECHO Klassik 2017 and the ICMA Award 2018.

He travelled to Australia and found employment as a trader of flax in New Zealand in the 1830s. Burns returned to Europe in 1835 and spent most of his remaining years as a showman giving lectures, where he described the customs of the MƒÅori, performed the haka, exhibited his MƒÅori tattoos and recounted his adventures in New Zealand. Early life It is likely that George Burns, later known as Barnet, was baptised in the parish of Kirkby Ireleth on 25 November 1805.

The Elizabeth returned to Sydney on 5 January 1831 and soon afterwards Burns appeared before the Police Magistrates where he was convicted of gross assault. A fellow seaman on the Elizabeth, James Nance, had accused Burns of being a convict and Burns had reacted by \\"leading [Nance] about the decks by his nose, like a pig by the snout\\".

Flax on the coast of New Zealand In January 1831 the Sydney merchant Joseph Barrow Montefiore had just returned from a voyage to New Zealand and required flax traders to be located at various parts of New Zealand. Barnet Burns agreed to return to New Zealand to trade with the MƒÅori for phormium tenax, a New Zealand flax used mainly for rope materials.Wigglesworth, Roger Philip, \\"The New Zealand timber and flax trade 1769‚Äì1840\\", PhD thesis, Massey University, 1981.

The Darling stopped at several places on the west coast of the North Island including Kawhia, Mokau, Taranaki and Kapiti Island before proceeding through Cook Strait to the east coast where Burns was landed at the Mahia peninsula. The Darling continued onto Poverty Bay where John Williams Harris was landed on 16 May 1831. Harris and Burns were among the first European residents in the area.

Southern side of Te Kuri a Paoa and Waihi beach It is likely that Burns and the tribe were located at Nukutaurua on the north-eastern coast of the Mahia peninsula. After 11 months a vessel arrived with orders to close the trading station but Burns refused to leave with the ship as Amotawa was about to give birth. Shortly afterwards most of the tribe went some distance from their pƒÅ to cultivate the potato gardens. Burns learned that the neighbouring Ngati Te Whatu-i-Apiti threatened to plunder the remaining trade goods. Burns escaped with Amotawa and her father in an open waka (canoe) and seven other MƒÅori and they headed north stopping overnight at Whareongaonga before landing at Waihi near Orongo beach on the southern side of Te Kuri a Paoa (Young Nick's Head). The canoe was hauled out of the water and the local MƒÅori, likely the NgƒÅi TƒÅmanuhiri, carried the property for nearly to Poverty Bay. A day later Burns proceeded inland to a stronghold of the Rongowhakaata at Manutuke on the Waipaoa River where there were two strong defensive pƒÅ named Umukapua and Orakaiapu. Soon afterwards at the request of his Chief, Burns went to Maraetai with about seven hundred men to battle but their enemies had fled and they returned and lived again in peace. Barnet Burns in Maori costume, image from National Library of Australia During an inland flax- buying trip with some of the members of his tribe, a party of NgƒÅi Te Rangi attacked, killed and ate the group with the exception of Barnet Burns. He managed to negotiate for his life by agreeing to live, fight and trade with them. Also, as part of the negotiations, Burns had to agree upon the party tattooing him. He was forced to have his full face, chest, thighs, and arms tattooed as a sign of loyalty to the tribe. Even though Burns did not want to, he agreed to save his life. When about a quarter of the tattoo on his face was completed, Burns escaped and found his way back to his own tribe, who sought vengeance without success as the NgƒÅi Te Rangi were not to be found. The Kekeparaoa pƒÅ site was at the location of the dark green trees on the Waikohu River In 1832 subtribes of Te Whakatohea from the Bay of Plenty region had settled in an area inland from Poverty Bay. An alliance of about 600 men from Rongowhakaata, Ngati Kahungunu, Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti and Nga Puhi under Te Wera a Hauraki\\"Te Wera, Hauraki Kaiteke\\", An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, 1966.

Retrieved 15 January 2009. located near the confluence of the Waipaoa River and the Waikohu river. Burns claimed to have led 150 men in the siege which lasted about three weeks. He described how a Whakatohea woman had attempted to escape from the pƒÅ by swimming across a river. She was captured and imprisoned. Resigned to being eaten, she assisted in preparing potatoes and threw herself onto the fire for a hƒÅngi feast. When the pƒÅ at Kekeparaoa had been breached, many of the imprisoned occupants were shared between the victorious tribes. Burns says he witnessed about 60 of the prisoners being killed and eaten; the flesh being cooked in a hƒÅngi or smoked for transportation to fellow tribal members. The schooner Prince of Denmark arrived at Poverty Bay and Burns was then engaged by the captain to continue as a flax trader at ¬£3.0 a month. He agreed to establish himself further north at Uawa which was named Tolaga Bay by Captain James Cook. When he arrived at Uawa, Burns settled on the northern side of the Uawa river with Te Urunga Wera while on the southern side another white man traded for Captain John Rudolphus Kent with Te Aitanga-a-Hauiti. From 1832 to 1834 he sent about 107 tons of flax to Sydney and he considered these his happiest years in New Zealand. Burns claimed to have been made a chief of over 600. The remaining part of his face and parts of his body were tattooed at nearby Waihau (Loisels beach). The Uawa river mouth at Tolaga Bay While at Uawa in about April 1833, Barnet Burns learned that three Englishmen were being held captive on the Waiapu River, near East Cape, the easternmost point of the North Island of New Zealand. A whaling vessel, Elizabeth, captain Black, had stopped at East Cape for provisions and during her stay three of the crew had run away. In return captain Black had seized 15 of the local NgƒÅti Porou and taken them away on the Elizabeth. Burns took a waka with about 60 men and after three days they had travelled from Uawa to Waiapu and found the Englishmen confined at a pƒÅ which was probably at Whakawhitira. The chief Kakatarau Turanga Treaty Kakatarau, known as Cotahrow to Barnet Burns, signed the East Coast copy of the treaty in May 1840 agreed to their release in exchange for a ransom that was to be paid at Uawa. However the NgƒÅti Porou were unfamiliar with the bay at Uawa and their waka capsized with the result that the ransom payment was waived. The schooner, Lord Byron later took the Englishmen to Sydney. The 15 NgƒÅti Porou had been taken to the Bay of Islands, enslaved by Nga Puhi, released and introduced to Christianity by the missionaries. In January 1834 the NgƒÅti Porou were returned to the East Cape on the schooner Fortitude by Rev William Yate and Rev William Williams of the Church Missionary Society. Departure from Uawa In October 1834 the ship , Captain John Thomas Chalmers, arrived at Uawa. Burns loaded his trade of flax and advised Captain Chalmers that he wished to settle with his employer in Sydney and so Burns paid ¬£5 for a passage. He bid farewell to his wife and children and Burns accompanied the ship to Sydney via Cloudy Bay and Queen Charlotte Sound. His children were daughters Tauhinu, Mokoraurangi and son Hori Waiti, who may have been born soon after Burns' departure.

Soon after the Bardaster arrived at Sydney on 2 November 1834, Barnet Burns arranged to transfer his grant of land at Tambourine Bay to Captain John Thomas Chalmers. At that time thousands of convicts resided in New South Wales and as Burns roamed the streets of Sydney his facial tattoo aroused suspicion that he had submitted to the operation of tattooing in order to prevent being recognised.Sydney Gazette, Tuesday, 6 January 1835.

His initial appearances in London included the Surrey Zoological Gardens (later the Royal Surrey Gardens), Victoria Theatre (now the Old Vic), Surrey Theatre and Astley's Amphitheatre. Introduced as Barnet Burns, The New Zealand Chief, he performed various MƒÅori songs and dances, including the haka, and he described customs of the MƒÅori. Upon obtaining an opportunity to appear at the Surrey Zoological Gardens, Barnet Burns had \\"made merry in honour of his engagement\\". The tattooed Englishman was brought before the Police Magistrate at Union Hall, London but Burns was soon \\"discharged and, out of spirits, [he had] taken to water\\".The Atlas, Sunday, 26 July 1835.

Burns proposed the establishment of a small colony of artisans and tradesmen under his protection, and offered to supply the British government and merchants with timber and flax. There is no record of the British government accepting Burns' proposal. Later in April 1836, Burns entertained in the Portsmouth and Portsea Theatre at the conclusion of a romance play. Barnet Burns had styled himself as Pahe-a-Range and in May 1836 he appeared at the Chichester Mechanics' Institution, where his lectures were described as \\"one incongruous jumble of impudence, of ignorance, of low wit, and bare-faced presumption\\".Chichester Garland, Volume 1, No. 1, June 1836, p. 53. This description was criticized by a reporter who attended lectures by Burns at the Town Hall of Brighton and recommended that Burns obtain the assistance of someone to help arrange the lectures. Despite Burns' shortcomings, the reporter stated that \\"those who go to a lecture to obtain information, without caring by what means it is conveyed, could, notwithstanding the rambling and unconnected nature of his address, gather sufficient to remunerate them for the money and time expended in attending it.\\"Brighton Patriot and South of England Free Press, Tuesday, 5 July 1836.

An unsuccessful appearance before the Acad√©mie des sciences at the Institut de France in Paris resulted in the academicians being annoyed at being deceived by Burns, who had apparently claimed to be King of Zealand. In 1837 Burns appeared at Nantes where he exhibited himself at a shop in rue de Gorges with an assurance that he would remain civilized for visitors.

Burns and his wife lived at 16 Rue Pastourelle in the 3rd arrondissement of Paris and had two children who, it appears, died young.

Burns was apparently summoned by Queen Victoria to take part in an English expedition to New Zealand in the capacity of interpreter. Following his departure, Burns' wife, Anne never heard from him again. Possible return visit to New Zealand There is circumstantial evidence for Barnet Burns making a return trip to New Zealand between February 1839 and October 1840. Barnet Burns had expressed a desire to return to New Zealand and had applied to join the expedition of the New Zealand Company on its ship Tory which sailed from London on 4 May 1839. His wife in France, Anne (n√©e Boval) understood that in 1840 Barnet Burns had travelled as an interpreter for an English expedition to New Zealand. Several English newspapers reported on a visit by Barnet Burns in about 1841.The Times, Monday 15 December 1845, p. 6. and it appears that he worked with the Wesleyan missionariesLeicester Journal, Friday, 9 January 1857. The census undertaken in Britain in June 1841 lists Barnet Burns' occupation as mariner which suggests that he had recently sailed. Barnet Burns' son, Hori Waiti, claims to remember his father escaping. Given the short period that Burns initially spent in New Zealand, Hori Waiti would only remember his father if Burns had made a return trip. Finally, Arthur Thomson mentions that: \\"One unemployed tattooed Pakeha Maori visited England, and acted the part of a New Zealand savage in several provincial theatres. Here he married an Englishwoman who accompanied him to New Zealand, but she eloped with a Yankee sailor, because the tattooed actor's old Maori wife met him and obtained an influence over him the white woman could not combat.\\"Thomson, A. S., The Story of New Zealand, 1859, Vol. I, p. 300. There are several similarities between this PƒÅkehƒÅ MƒÅori and Barnet Burns to suggest that they might be the same person. Marriage to Mrs Rosina Crowther The United Kingdom Census 1841 recorded the occupants of every UK household on the night of 6 June 1841 when Barnet Burns, mariner, and Rosina Crowther, pedlar, were lodging at Vincent Street, Sculcoates, Kingston upon Hull. A few days later, The New Zealand Chief, Mr. Burns, delivered two lectures at the Hull Mechanics' Institute.Broadside for two lectures at the Hull Mechanics' Institute in June 1841, F/Broadside F3166, Petherick Reading Room, National Library of Australia The broadside for the lectures explains how he was saved from being eaten by the \\"interposition of one of the Chief's daughters; how he ingratiated himself into their favour, submitted to be tattooed and ultimately became chief of a tribe\\". The broadside continues to advertise that \\"he will also exhibit the real head of a New Zealand Chief, his opponent in battle, and describe the operation of tattooing, &c.;\\" Burns was to be accompanied by Mrs Crowther who would \\"perform several favourite Airs upon The Musical Glasses at Intervals during the Evening.\\" On 18 June 1841, Barnet Burns appeared at the Hull Zoological Gardens to participate in a Grand Gala in commemoration of the Battle of Waterloo, which occurred 26 years previously. In addition to his usual repertoire describing Maori customs, Burns appeared on the lake and showed how the Maori rowed their waka including how a chief excited his comrades to action. The Gala included a display of fireworks, Montgolfier balloons and performances from military bands.Hull Packet, 18 June 1841. In January 1842 Barnet Burns had moved to Birmingham where he lectured before the Mechanics' Institution at Newhall Street and where he had a booklet published. By that time he and Rosina had married as the handbill states that \\"Mrs. Burns will also perform several admired Airs and Waltzes upon the Musical Glasses\\".

He encouraged his audience to consider New Zealand for immigration saying there was \\"no clime better calculated to suit the Englishman\\" and through the efforts of the missionaries New Zealand had \\"become civilized\\". Assembly Room, Truro where Burns lectured in 1853 In about 1850, Burns gave his lectures in Manchester and one of the people in the audience was the wife of William Leonard Williams who was to be sent like his father as a missionary to New Zealand. In 1853 W. L. Williams presented Burns' booklet and a picture of Burns to his son, Hori Waiti, in front of a crowd at Tokomaru Bay. Williams had already checked the veracity of the booklet and picture, but he asked publicly if Burns was recognised and it was confirmed and Hori Waiti learnt that Burns was his father. This picture of Barnet Burns is still in the family. A tour through Cornwall in early 1853 included lectures at the Assembly Room in Truro, the Town Hall in RedruthWest Briton, 14 January 1853. and Union Hall in Penzance.West Briton, 28 January 1853. By this time Barnet Burns' occupation was given as Lecturer and that of Rosina Burns was given as Professor of Music, her musical glasses producing a harmony that was \\"indisputably the most exquisite\\". In November 1856 Barnet Burns and his wife went to Leicester to deliver a course of lectures on New Zealand. Three lectures were advertised, but at the close of the second Burns became ill and was confined to his bed for nearly eight weeks. Rosina Burns sold every available article she possessed but soon they were destitute and an appeal was made for help. By January 1857 Barnet Burns had recovered sufficiently to be able to lecture accompanied, as usual, by Rosina on the musical glasses.Leicester Journal, Friday, 30 January 1857. Further funds were raised from an edition of Burns' booklet published at Leicester. Death Barnet Burns died on 26 December 1860 at Eldad, East Stonehouse, Plymouth. The death certificate stated that George Barnet Burns, lecturer, died at age 53 and the cause of death was \\"morbus cordis cirrhosis of liver ascites\\". There were various times during his life when Burns had been found drunk and it seems that he finally succumbed to his alcoholism. His obituary stated that Barnet Burns was better known as Pahe-a-Range, the New Zealand Chief, that he had suffered a long and painful illness and that he left behind a widow and two children to lament their loss.The Plymouth and Devonport Journal, Thursday, 3 January 1861. The identities of the children mentioned in the obituary are not known. Barnet Burns was buried in a common grave on 30 December 1860 at what is now the Ford Park Cemetery,Ford Park Cemetery formerly the Plymouth Devonport and Stonehouse Cemetery. Plymouth.

Closer ties with ASEAN are supported by all political parties in East Timor. East Timor would have by far the smallest GDP in the ASEAN, less than 15% of the smallest current ASEAN member state Laos.  History  In 2002, East Timor was recognised as an observer of ASEAN and joined the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2005. In January 2007, the country acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, pledging to renounce the use of force and binding East Timor to non- interference in the internal affairs of ASEAN member states. In 2005, East Timor said it wanted to be a member by 2010. In December 2007 President Jos√© Ramos-Horta restated that joining was a top priority, and he hoped to join by 2012. In January 2009, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva said that his country would support East Timor's membership of ASEAN by 2012. East Timor officially applied for membership in ASEAN on 4 March 2011. After elections in 2012, the new government reaffirmed their commitment to joining the association. While Indonesia, which East Timor gained their independence from in 2002, has pushed for them to be granted ASEAN membership, other countries, such as Singapore and Laos, have objected on the grounds that East Timor is not yet developed enough to join. However, after the ASEAN summit in April 2013, Secretary General of ASEAN L√™ L∆∞∆°ng Minh stated that all member states now supported Timor-Leste's admission to the association. Minh also stated that \\"Timor Leste is not yet ready to join ASEAN. So we are pushing them to qualify the obligations\\". Philippine President Benigno Aquino III pledged his country's support to East Timor's ASEAN membership in June 2013. The Philippines has previously supported Timor-Leste's ASEAN membership through official documents in 2002 and 2010. By September 2013, the ASEAN's Coordinating Council Working Group was still evaluating Timor-Leste's membership application, and Minh said that there was no timeline for when the assessment would be completed. Singapore pledged that it would not block Timor-Leste's membership in the association, with their Second Minister for Foreign Affairs, Grace Fu, saying \\"For any member to come into ASEAN and to be ready for 2015 will be quite a big step. Whether Timor Leste is ready, whether it has its eyes on 2015, we like to have a working group to evaluate\\". In November 2013, U Aung Htoo, ASEAN Affairs Department deputy director, said that Timor Leste would not be ready to join in 2014 since they do not have an embassy in all 10 current ASEAN member states, a necessity for membership. In 2015, East Timor said it is now ready to join the association at any time, telling via East Timor's ambassador to Malaysia that their country had at least fulfilled two major requirements for ASEAN membership such as the country was located in this region and it had opened embassies in ASEAN member countries. The Philippines re-echoed its support for East Timor's accession to ASEAN on the same year. In 2017, the Philippines, a close ally of Timor-Leste, became the ASEAN host for 2017. A general meeting is expected to conclude in 17 November, however, foreign reports in 4 November have said that ASEAN would bypass Timor-Leste's membership in 2017, mostly because of its lack of human resources which was pointed out by Singapore. Despite this, it was announced that East Timor Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri will continue East Timor's participation in ASEAN as an observer during the 2017 summit. The Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia reiterated Timor-Leste's membership application during the summits, however, the other 6 ASEAN member states led by Singapore did not support the move. On the last day of the summit, the Philippines was mandated by tradition to pass the ASEAN chairmanship to Singapore, whose chairmanship begins in January. As according to the ASEAN chairman's statement which hosted by the Philippines in 2018, the association is still studying Timor Leste's application for membership. Despite Singapore being historically opposing Timor-Leste's accession to the association due to economic reasons, the country began to openly stating they are welcoming the country's membership application when Timorese Prime Minister visited the latter. In June 2019, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen expressed his country support for Timor-Leste to become the 11th member of ASEAN ahead of a meeting with Timor-Leste Minister of Foreign Affairs Dion√≠sio Babo. Since Thailand took over the chairmanship of the association in 2019, Timor-Leste Foreign Affairs Minister Dion√≠sio noted that a fact-finding mission has been formed to visit their country in September to determine their readiness in joining the association, adding that Brunei has given assurance to support the country's bid to join ASEAN, in which the latter hopes \\"it will happen sooner rather than later\\". Further in July, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah reiterated their support for the country to join ASEAN during his meeting with Dion√≠sio who was in Putrajaya for a visit in the same month, telling their country stand that Malaysia is always consistent to support Timor-Leste's admission into the association ever since the republic submitted its application in 2011. Similar support was expressed by Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi in the same month during the plenary session of the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) in Bangkok, Thailand where she explained that \\"Indonesian support has been expressed many times even since the beginning, not only on political sense, but including through various assistance schemes to prepare and improve Timor-Leste capacity to meet the requirements in joining the association\\".

Johnsen (1857‚Äì1911) was a pioneer U.S. manufacturer of ski equipment and related gear. Johnsen is especially notable for writing the first book on skiing published in America. He was posthumously inducted into the Maine Ski Hall of Fame, a division of the Ski Museum of Maine. Born in Manchester, England, Johnsen emigrated to Portland, Maine, as a 21-year-old apprentice cabinetmaker and was employed in his father‚Äôs woodworking business. He became interested in skiing by reading an article in the April, 1895 issue of Scientific American and took up the sport with passion. Johnsen started his own manufacturing business in Portland in 1904: Tajco Sporting Goods specialized in building gasoline-powered pleasure boats ‚îÄ a novelty at the time ‚îÄ plus snowshoes, ski gear and push sleds. The 1905 Tajco winter sports catalogue lists 12 models of skis at prices from $3.50 to $18. Related gear included five binding models and five styles of ski poles ‚îÄ described as ‚Äúpush sticks.‚Äù To help sell his products, Johnsen published The Winter Sport of Skeeing in 1905. The little book included 38 pages of description and detailed how-to instructions for cross-country, downhill and jumping. The Tajco winter sports catalogue comprised the final 16 pages. A replica edition of The Winter Sport of Skeeing was published in 1994 by the International Skiing History Association. The Winter Sport of Skeeing is notable for Johnsen‚Äôs buoyantly upbeat writing style and his depiction of skiing as a joyous recreational activity. Its numerous photographs show men and women blissfully enjoying themselves on Tajco products. The introductory chapter includes the statement that ‚Äúskeeing is the most exhilarating, most fascinating, most healthful and most delightful of all the winter sports, and that, indulged in sensibly and not to excess, it is indeed an ideal outdoor pastime for everybody young and old.‚Äù Tajco skis sold poorly and Johnsen closed the company in 1907. He died near Boston, Massachusetts in 1911. Johnsen was a visionary with little commercial acumen, according to ski historian Glenn Parkinson‚Äôs book First Tracks: Stories from Maine‚Äôs Skiing Heritage. Parkinson noted that Johnsen‚Äôs catalogue emphasized expensive ski gear at a time when the sport was in its infancy in America and the U.S. market was dominated by cheap products. Parkinson‚Äôs assessment of the pioneer ski manufacturer concludes: ‚ÄúTheo A. Johnsen recognized the fundamental changes about to happen in two sports yet was unable to capitalize on either one. But he had left a bequest to the sport of skiing ‚îÄ America‚Äôs first ski book, a testimonial matched in fervor by few skiers since.‚Äù Johnsen was honored by induction into the 2003 inaugural class of the Maine Ski Hall of Fame, a division of the Ski Museum of Maine. Early in 2009 the museum acquired a collection of 10 hand-made miniature Johnsen skis ‚îÄ 18-inch models that were once used by traveling salesmen. The New England Ski Museum owns and displays the only known extant pair of Tajco skis. References * Johnsen, Theo A.

PEI focuses on the research and observation of the economic and social development, particularly in the Baltic Sea region economies and in the EU‚Äôs eastern neighbouring countries.  Organisation  In terms of administration, PEI is part of the Department of Marketing and International Business at Turku School of Economics. The Institute employs about 10 researchers, most of whom work with project-based funding. The Director of the unit is Professor Kari Liuhto from Turku School of Economics. The operation of the Pan-European Institute is supported by an advisory body, which is composed of the chair and 10 members. In May 2020, the institute's advisory body consisted of: Chair: Juhani Wihanto, CEO, Wihanto Group Members: * Matti Anttonen, Permanent State Secretary, Ministry for Foreign Affairs * Erik Helin, CEO, Spectra * Mikko Ketonen, Chairman of the Board (emeritus), TS-Yhtym√§ Oy * Urpo Kivikari, Professor (emeritus), Turku School of Economics * Henrik Lax, MEP 2004-2009 * Paula Lehtom√§ki, Secretary General, Nordic Council of Ministers * Maarit Lindstr√∂m, Director, Chief Economist, Finnish Forest Industries Federation * Olli Pohjanvirta, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Nurminen Logistics * Aleksi Randell, Director General, Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries * Seppo Remes, Professor of Practice, Lappeenranta-Lahti University of Technology  History  PEI started its operations based on a private initiative and fund-raising in the autumn of 1987. At first, the unit operated under the name the Institute for East-West Trade. In its research and education, the Institute for East-West Trade focused on the socialist economies in Europe and the Soviet Union of the time. Since the establishment of the unit, Baltic Sea region economies were also included among its key subjects of research and education. The first lectures on the topic were held in the academic year 1986‚Äì1987, when the unit also launched its research activities. Soon after the establishment of the Institute for East-West Trade, the European Institute was created. The merger of the two units began to seem sensible after the era of socialism was consigned to history in Europe. The Institute for East-West Trade and the European Institute merged into the Pan-European Institute at the end of the 1990s. In 1987‚Äì2003, Professor Urpo Kivikari acted as the director of the unit. After Professor Kivikari retired, in autumn 2003 Professor Kari Liuhto was invited from Lappeenranta University of Technology to head the Pan- European Institute. In 2015, the Pan-European Institute was awarded the Europe Award by the European Foundation (currently part of the Turku University Foundation). The Pan-European Institute celebrated its 30th anniversary in 2017 by organising a seminar called ‚ÄúRussian enigma ‚Äì Decoding mysteries and turning them into business opportunities‚Äù.  Research  During more than three decades, PEI has conducted dozens of commissioned studies, funded by, for example, the European Union, the Prime Minister's Office, the Finnish ministries and the Academy of Finland. In addition to research, experts of the Pan-European Institute have been involved in the development of the economic systems of several former Soviet republics. As an example, Professor Kari Liuhto's participated in designing the Strategy 2020 for the Russian Government. PEI has been engaged in close research cooperation with the Centrum Balticum Foundation since autumn 2011, when Professor Liuhto began as the Foundation's part-time director. In its research, the Pan-European Institute focuses on the following five themes: * Economic and business development in the Baltic Sea region economies (focusing on the development of the maritime cluster) * Economic relations between the EU and Russia * Flow of foreign direct investments to and from Russia * Socio-economic development in Europe and its neighbourhood * Business development in the EU and in its eastern neighbouring countries. In the following, some examples of PEI research projects: * KAPPAS - Trade policy experts and know-how to Finland (2019-2022): The purpose of the project is to increase trade policy education in Finland, to organise business training related to the topic and to produce scientific research on the current state and future development of trade policy. The project is funded by the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers Foundation. * ECOPRODIGI (2017‚Äì2020): The aim of the project was to increase eco-efficiency of the maritime industry in the Baltic Sea region with the solutions provided by digitalisation. This EU-funded cooperation project involved 21 partners from five different Baltic Sea countries. PEI acted as the main coordinator of the project. * DigiPro (2016‚Äì2018): During the project, proactive project management solutions were developed for business use. The stakeholders in the project were Turku School of Economics, Lappeenranta University of Technology and four Finnish SMEs. * MNEmerge (2014‚Äì2016): This EU-funded project explored the role of multinational enterprises (MNEs) in addressing global development challenges. The project included field research in Brazil, Ghana and India. The project studied such matters as what kind of socio-economic impacts the activities of multinational enterprises have in developing countries and how cooperation between companies and decision-makers could be strengthened to promote responsible business. * Russia's final energy frontier ‚Äì Sustainability challenges of the Russian Far North (2014‚Äì2016): The project examined how energy policy is shaped in Russian Far North through interaction between internal factors, international companies and international politics. The project also examined what kind of a role the socio-economic development of local communities and the environmental responsibility play in the policy. The project was implemented in cooperation with the University of Helsinki and a Japanese research group. * SmartComp (2012‚Äì2013): The EU-funded project analysed the current situation of the maritime cluster in the Baltic Sea region and its prospects in Latvia, Finland and Estonia. * The international dimension of the Russian innovation ecosystem (2011‚Äì2014): The main objective of the research project was to examine the use of international connections and networks and their impact on the Russian innovation system. * Wider Europe ‚Äì Regional Security Report (2010‚Äì2011): The Pan-European Institute followed the security developments in Eastern Central Europe, South Caucasus and Central Asia. The reports were part of the Security and Development Research within the Wider Europe Initiative Security Cluster, which was funded by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in the framework of development cooperation.  Teaching and education  The research carried out by PEI creates foundations for the teaching and education provided by the unit at Turku School of Economics. PEI offers three courses with lectures, which are part of the teaching on offer in the subject of international business: * Business in the Baltic Sea Region: The course discusses the development of the Baltic Sea economic area and the business environment of the region. The lectures are given in English. * Doing Business in Wider Europe: The course explores business in a Wider Europe, or Europe and its neighbourhood. The course is in English. * Trade Policy and International Business: This course taught in Finnish deals with the transformation of trade policy and its impacts on business activities  Activating discussion in the Baltic Sea region  Since 2004, PEI has been publishing a review focusing on the Baltic Sea region, called the ‚ÄúBaltic Rim Economies‚Äù. The distribution list covers tens of thousands of readers in over 80 countries. Some 3,000 experts have contributed articles to the magazine, including EU Commissioners (e.g. Jean- Claude Juncker, Jos√© Manuel Barroso), ministers, diplomats, mayors, businessmen, journalists and representatives of the world of research.

History  LUSAS has its origins back in 1970 when a group of research workers at the University of London (now incorporated into Imperial College London) began work on the London University Stress Analysis System, \\"LUSAS\\". This team was led by Dr. Paul Lyons, who, in 1982, set up an independent company, Finite Element Analysis Ltd., to further develop, and subsequently market the software as a general purpose structural analysis system. In 1997, following the introduction of a range of specialist application software packages, the company, for awareness reasons, then started to trade under the LUSAS name.  Software  LUSAS software consists of a Windows-based Modeller, used for model building and viewing of results, and a Solver for carrying out an analysis. Four commercial application products cater for the following industries: * Civil & Structural - for civil, structural, nuclear, seismic, geotechnical and offshore engineering. * Bridge - for bridge engineering analysis, design, and assessment. * Analyst - for automotive, aerospace, defence, manufacturing and general engineering analysis. * Composite - for engineers designing composite products or components. For Universities, an Academic version which permits the running of any commercial LUSAS software product can be used for teaching and research use.  Example Applications  Civil and structural engineering uses include Anthony Gormley's Quantum Cloud, built alongside the Millennium Dome, (now the O2 Arena), as part of UK's Millennium Commission sponsored celebrations for the year 2000; Spinnaker Tower, the tallest publicly accessible provincial structure in the UK; and Gwangmyeong Velodrome, the largest domed structure built, so far, in South Korea. Bridges designed with the aid of LUSAS include the Lune Millennium Bridge, and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge both also built, coincidentally, as part of the UK's year 2000 celebrations, and the Vasco da Gama cable stayed bridge and associated viaduct structures in Portugal. General mechanical engineering uses are extremely varied and include thermal analysis of marine loading arms - used to transfer Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) from shore to ship and vice versa at a temperature of -163 degrees Celsius, nonlinear analysis of nylon polyamide cable ties used to bundle cables together, and contact analysis of titanium and ceramic hip joint components as used in artificial hip replacement Composites engineering applications involve the analysis of composite material layups for potential delamination, material damage and fatigue modelling of many types of components in the automotive, aviation, and marine industries.

It is a large two storey limestone building set in extensive grounds, with a distinctive square crenellated tower, and was entered in the Register of the National Estate in 1987.State heritage register listing Background In 1847 the General Board of Education was established to oversee school development in the Swan River Colony. After becoming the Central Board of Education, it was superseded by the Education Department in 1893, which classified schools, graded teachers, defined teachers' positions, implemented a salary scale for teachers, abolished school fees, provided for co-educational schools, and made attendance compulsory for children between the ages of six and 14. At this time, the Education Department had \\"external study\\" for student teachers, where they taught in the classroom while studying for examinations set by the Department.http://www.ecu.edu.au/GPPS/rams/Holdings.html In 1902, the College was opened and students could gain qualifications through studying there. It was the only place one could do this until the 1950s when the Churchlands and Graylands colleges opened. The function of teacher education did not pass into the university sector until the 1980s. The College's last Director was Thomas Ryan (1924-2002), who completed his teacher training at the College and graduated in 1947.

Cricket Born in India, Bush played at Gloucestershire as an amateur. He was Gloucestershire's wicket-keeper in their strong side of the 1870s which won the only four championships in their history, one of them shared. Bush was a good friend of captain W.G. Grace and was the best man at his wedding. He toured Australia with a W.G. Grace XI in 1873/74 which caused him to miss a rugby international against Scotland. Bush made just two half centuries in his first-class career, with a highest score of 57 against Yorkshire in an 1879 County Match. Aside from playing at Gloucestershire, Bush also represented the Gentlemen cricket team in a couple of Gentlemen v Players fixtures and also played a match for the South of England cricket team. Rugby Bush was capped five times for England at international rugby, playing as a forward. All but one of those came against Scotland, with games in 1872, 1873, 1875 and 1876. He won his only other cap when he lined up for England against Ireland at Leinster in 1875. Before his England debut, Bush had made five appearances for Blackheath.

Otherwise, we first need to compensate the delays and then sum them up. To reach this goal, we may only add the weighted version of the signals with appropriate weight values. We do this in such a way that the frequency domain output of this weighted sum produces a zero result. This method is called null steering. The generated weights are of course related to each other and this relation is a function of delay and central working frequency of the source. Performance If the transmitter knows the downlink channel state information (CSI) perfectly, ZF-precoding can achieve almost the system capacity when the number of users is large. On the other hand, with limited channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) the performance of ZF-precoding decreases depending on the accuracy of CSIT. ZF-precoding requires the significant feedback overhead with respect to signal-to-noise- ratio (SNR) so as to achieve the full multiplexing gain. Inaccurate CSIT results in the significant throughput loss because of residual multiuser interferences. Multiuser interferences remain since they can not be nulled with beams generated by imperfect CSIT. Mathematical description In a multiple antenna downlink system which comprises an N_t transmit antenna access point (AP) and K single receive antenna users, the received signal of user k is described as :y_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^T\\\\mathbf{x}+n_k, \\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, K where \\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^K s_i P_i \\\\mathbf{w}_i is the N_t \\\\times 1 vector of transmitted symbols, n_k is the noise signal, \\\\mathbf{h}_k is the N_t \\\\times 1 channel vector and \\\\mathbf{w}_i is the N_t \\\\times 1 linear precoding vector. From the fact that each beam generated by ZF-precoding is orthogonal to all the other user channel vectors, one can rewrite the received signal as :y_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^T \\\\sum_{i=1}^K s_i P_i \\\\mathbf{w}_i+n_k = \\\\mathbf{h}_k^T s_k P_k \\\\mathbf{w}_k +n_k, \\\\quad k=1,2, \\\\ldots, K For comparison purpose, we describe the received signal model for multiple antenna uplink systems. In the uplink system with a N_r receiver antenna AP and K K single transmit antenna user, the received signal at the AP is described as :\\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{K} s_i \\\\mathbf{h}_i + \\\\mathbf{n} where s_i is the transmitted signal of user i, \\\\mathbf{n} is the N_r \\\\times 1 noise vector, \\\\mathbf{h}_k is the N_r \\\\times 1 channel vector. = Quantify the feedback amount = Quantify the amount of the feedback resource required to maintain at least a given throughput performance gap between zero-forcing with perfect feedback and with limited feedback, i.e., :\\\\Delta R = R_{ZF} - R_{FB} \\\\leq \\\\log_2 g . Jindal showed that the required feedback bits of a spatially uncorrelated channel should be scaled according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is given by: : B = (M-1) \\\\log_2 \\\\rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \\\\log_2 (g-1) where M is the number of transmit antennas and \\\\rho_{b,m} is the SNR of the downlink channel. To feed back B bits though the uplink channel, the throughput performance of the uplink channel should be larger than or equal to 'B' : b_{FB} \\\\log_2(1+\\\\rho_{FB}) \\\\geq B where b = \\\\Omega_{FB} T_{FB} is the feedback resource consisted by multiplying the feedback frequency resource and the frequency temporal resource subsequently and \\\\rho_{FB} is SNR of the feedback channel. Then, the required feedback resource to satisfy \\\\Delta R \\\\leq \\\\log_2 g is : b_{FB} \\\\geq \\\\frac{B}{\\\\log_2(1+\\\\rho_{FB})} = \\\\frac{(M-1) \\\\log_2 \\\\rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \\\\log_2 (g-1)}{\\\\log_2(1+\\\\rho_{FB})} . Note that differently from the feedback bits case, the required feedback resource is a function of both downlink and uplink channel conditions. It is reasonable to include the uplink channel status in the calculation of the feedback resource since the uplink channel status determines the capacity, i.e., bits/second per unit frequency band (Hz), of the feedback link. Consider a case when SNR of the downlink and uplink are proportion such that \\\\rho_{b,m} / \\\\rho_{FB}) = C_{up,dn} is constant and both SNRs are sufficiently high. Then, the feedback resource will be only proportional to the number of transmit antennas : b_{FB,min}^* = \\\\lim_{\\\\rho_{FB} \\\\to \\\\infty } \\\\frac{(M-1) \\\\log_2 \\\\rho_{b,m} - (M-1) \\\\log_2 (g-1)}{\\\\log_2(1+\\\\rho_{FB})} = M - 1. It follows from the above equation that the feedback resource (b_{FB}) is not necessary to scale according to SNR of the downlink channel, which is almost contradict to the case of the feedback bits. One, hence, sees that the whole systematic analysis can reverse the facts resulted from each reductioned situation.

He immigrated to Israel at the end of Stalinist period in postwar Poland, where he became a professor at Tel Aviv University. He died in Haifa. Muszkat's signature BiographyEarly life= Marian Muszkat was born in Suwa≈Çki (Poland under partitions), where he completed primary and then secondary school. In 1927 he began studies at the University of Warsaw. In Warsaw Muszkat studied law, and simultaneously worked as a clerk in factories and as a school teacher. As a student he belonged to socialist academic organizations. Muszkat was a distinctive student, thereby he soon travelled to France to continue his studies at the University of Nancy. During his stay in Nancy, Muszkat penned some new ideas about public international law, peremptory norm and international problems concerning the Third World countries. In 1931 Muszkat obtained a degree of Master of Law, and in 1936 at the same University he received a degree of Doctor of Law. =During World War II= During World War II, Muszkat relocated to Vilnius first, where worked in Prawda Wile≈Ñska, and lectured at the Vilnius University. In June 1941 he evacuated to the Soviet Union. In 1941‚Äì1943 he was a clerk in a kolkhoz and a teacher in the Gzy‚ÄìOrda Pedagogic Institute. In May 1943 Muszkat joined the People's Army of Poland (Ludowe Wojsko Polskie). Having completed officers course, he served as lieutenant in the Polish 1st Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko Infantry Division. In October 1943 he became a military judge of the Martial Court at Polish First Army. In 1945 he was promoted to a judge of Supreme Court Martial. In the Court, Muszkat was a vice-chairman and chief of the War Crimes Commission. After his return to Poland with the Soviet westward offensive in 1945, he became a member of Polish Workers' Party (PPR). On 5 December 1946 Muszkat was demobilized from army as a colonel. =The Polish People's Republic= After the war he began his work in the Stalinist Ministry of Justice as deputy in the Polish Highest Military Court (Najwy≈ºszy SƒÖd Wojskowy, NSW), investigating German war crimes. Muszkat was a specialist in the field of international public law, therefore the Ministry of Justice dispatched him to Nuremberg, as chairperson of the Polish delegation. At the Nuremberg Trials Mushkat directed Polish delegation which also included Prof Tadeusz Cyprian and prosecutors: Prof Jerzy Sawicki and Dr Stanis≈Çaw Piotrowski. They prepared ‚ÄúPolish indictment‚Äù containing the list of proved Nazi war crimes committed in Polish territory. Having returned to Poland he began scientific and didactic activity. At University of Warsaw he lectured military law and international public law in International Public and Private Law Department, directed by prof Cezary Berezowski. K. Karski, A Brief Review of Instruction on the Public International Law at the University of Warsaw, \\"Miscellanea Iuris Gentium\\" 1991, vol.2; He also lectured at Central Law School, General Headquarters Academy and Polish International Affairs Institute (1950-1951 its director). In 1950, for his dissertation in the Stalinist International criminal law, new domain development he was awarded a professorship. He was co-founder and editor Law and Life magazine. Mushkat wrote from the pro-Soviet point of view. He propagated communist ideals, especially those of his mentor Andriej Wyszynski. Amongst Polish scientist Muszkat has some opponents. For instance prof. Stefan Korbo≈Ñski wrote later that \\"Muszkat's views transformed the courts into a political institution, with prosecutors as masters of life and death of absolutely everyone (...) and barristers, as communist police helpers.\\"S. Korbo≈Ñski, W imieniu Kremla [In Kremlin's Name], Paris 1956.

At Tel Aviv University he lectured international public law and international affairs. In 1961 Yad Vashem Institute designated him as co-ordinator and adviser to Adolf Eichmann trial. Muszkat, at the request of Israel's government, was a consultant in many strategic matters undertook by this country.K. Karski, Marian Muszkat ‚Äì Professor of Law and International Relations, (in:) The Polish Diplomatic Review no 4 (38) 2007 Professor Muszkat became a member of many international institutes, organizations, and associations, for example: the International Peace Institute, the World Academy of Art and Science, American Academy of Political and Social Science, International Bar Association, World Federalist Movement, Institut Fran√ßais de Pol√©mologie, and the National Institute of Justice. He participated in many congresses and symposiums on the whole world to field politic research, peace research and futurology. Muszkat is author of many publications edited in: Polish, English, French, Hebrew, German, Russian, Czech, Hungarian and Chinese, too. He wrote first Polish modern textbook to international public law, Outline of the International Public Law Muszkat M. (edit.), Warsaw 1955 (two volumes). He died September 30, 1995 in Haifa.

The oldest road in the Jurong area, it was first constructed between 1852 to 1853 during the early British colonial period to create a proper road link between the rural areas of Jurong and the rest of Singapore. Later, it was extended towards Bukit Timah Road in 1929. In the 1960s, Jurong Road's original span ran from Bukit Timah Road (directly in front of the former Bukit Timah Fire Station) to a dead end in Tuas (at the present-day junction of Tuas Road and Pioneer Road). The stretch of this roadway between Upper Bukit Timah Road and Jalan Jurong Kechil is now known as Old Jurong Road (). Upper Jurong Road starts from the western end of Boon Lay Way and ends at Pasir Laba Flyover of the Pan Island Expressway (PIE), after which it continues briefly towards Pasir Laba Camp and the SAF Multi-Mission Range Complex (MMRC). Up till 26 September 2020, a short section of the original road (which still bears the historic Jurong Road name) connects Jurong West Avenue 2 and Bukit Batok Road, running roughly parallel to the PIE. Smaller roads (mostly rural tracks formerly serving several villages (kampongs) scattered in the Tengah and Hong Kah localities) along the current Jurong Road spread out further into the largely-forested area of Tengah; these include Track 18, Track 20 and Track 22. Track 22 links to Jalan Chichau and Jalan Lam Sam (located along the southern edge of the Choa Chu Kang area). Both Jalan Chichau and Jalan Lam Sam has been removed from January 2019, and the remaining section were removed from 27 September 2020. A large portion of Jurong Road was permanently closed from 27 September 2020, together with Track 18, Track 20 and Track 22, leaving only a short stretch between Bukit Batok Road and the entrance of the nearby Heavy Vehicle Carpark operational.

History The Glasgow University Athletic Club was founded on 20 April 1881 and its constitution approved by the Senate ten days later. Its founding aim was to \\"promote all forms of Athletic Exercise\\", an aim which continues to this day. In 1903, a women's section was established at Queen Margaret College, the women's section of the University. The Athletic Club provided representation on behalf of all students five years before the foundation of the Students' Representative Council, which now fulfills this role. Along with the Dialectic Society and Medico-Chirurgical Society, the Athletic Club was instrumental in founding the Glasgow University Union in 1885, and the two maintain a close relationship. In 1996, the Club became the Glasgow University Sports Association, a name intended to encapsulate better the work done by the organisation. Activities The Association provides financial, administrative and representational support to individuals and groups involved in sport and recreation at University of Glasgow. The highlight of the Association's year is the GUSA Ball (or Annual Awards Dinner and Dance) in February, a black-tie affair at which Blues, Half-Blues and Awards are presented to successful athletes and teams.

It is located in the district of Konak, roughly bounded by Dr. Mustafa Enver Bey Avenue on the north, 1395th Street, 1396th Street and Bozkurt Avenue on the east, M√ºrsel Pa≈üa Boulevard on the south, and Dr. Refik Saydam and ≈ûair E≈üref boulevards on the west. K√ºlt√ºrpark was founded in 1936 on an area of , which was ruined by the great fire of Smyrna. Since then, it has been hosting the ƒ∞zmir International Fair. In 1939, the park has expanded to . History The third edition of the 9th of September Fair was held in 1933 on an area next to Cumhuriyet Square where Swiss√¥tel B√ºy√ºk Efes exists today. Deputy Mayor Suat Yurtkoru shared his thoughts with Mayor Beh√ßet Uz that the fairground wouldn't be enough in the coming years and the city needs a place like Gorky Park in Moscow. The report prepared by Yurtkoru at Uz's request was accepted in the municipal council on May 14, 1934 and the construction of K√ºlt√ºrpark was approved. Uz went to Moscow in 1935 and had two architects commissioned by Mayor Nikolai Bulganin draft a project. The debris in the -area, which was ruined by the great fire of Smyrna, started to be cleaned in the second half of 1934 and the foundation of K√ºlt√ºrpark was laid on January 1, 1936. Before the fire, there was an Armenian quarter in this area. K√ºlt√ºrpark was opened to the public on September 1, 1936 with the 6th ƒ∞zmir International Fair, inaugurated by Prime Minister ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º. In 1937, ƒ∞zmir Parachute Tower was built in the park. In 1938, ƒ∞zmir Zoo and Vakƒ±flar Pavilion and Clock Tower were opened. In 1939, the park was expanded for southwards and has reached in size. In 1951, the ƒ∞zmir Archaeological Museum moved into the park where it was active until 1984. In September 1952, the ƒ∞zmir Art and Sculpture Museum was opened in the park and moved to its new building, which was built outside the park in 1973. In 2004, ƒ∞zmir Museum of History and Art was established inside the park. With the opening of ƒ∞zmir Wildlife Park in 2008, the zoo in the park was closed and the animals were moved to the new area. In August 2009, an underground car park with 594 vehicle capacity was put into service. In June 2015, free Wi-Fi was made available in the park. All the fairs in the city were organized in K√ºlt√ºrpark before Fuar ƒ∞zmir was built in 2015 in Gaziemir. Today only ƒ∞zmir International Fair and ƒ∞zmir Book Fair are held in the park. In 2017, the K√ºlt√ºrpark Cup tennis tournament was held for the first time. Features K√ºlt√ºrpark, which is surrounded by walls, has five entrance gates: Lozan Gate, Montr√∂ Gate, 9 Eyl√ºl Gate, Cumhuriyet Gate, and 26 Aƒüustos Gate. (The first two refer to two international treaties, the third refer to the liberation of ƒ∞zmir the forth means Republic and the last refer to the Turkish victory at the end of the Turkish War of Independence) Some of the facilities in the park are fourteen indoor exhibition halls, four conference halls, Atat√ºrk Open Air Theater, ƒ∞smet ƒ∞n√∂n√º Art Center, ƒ∞zmir Sanat, a marriage office, Celal Atik Sport Hall, an amusement park, a parachute tower, Youth Theater, a museum, a 1,850-metre long running track, a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a football pitch.

M. G. Le Cl√©zio. The novel tells the story of two teenage girls on the threshold and in the aftermath of World War II. Esther, a French Jew who flees for Jerusalem with her mother just after Italy's occupation of a small section of south-east France ended during World War II; and Nejma, a young Arab orphaned and unable to return to the ancient city of her birth, Akka, after the Israeli declaration of statehood. Esther emigrates to the newborn state of Israel, where she encounters another group of refugees, this time Palestinian. Plot summary In the year 1944 in a mountainous area on the French-Italian border Esther and her mother and all the Jews in the village of Saint-Martin must cross from France to Italy to avoid the SS. After the war, she and her mother, Elizabeth, begin their long journey to France, to the sailing ship Sette FratelliSette Fratelli means \\"Seven Brothers\\" which will take them to Palestine. When Esther finally arrives in Jerusalem, she briefly meets and exchanges names with Nejma, a Palestinian, another wanderer, one who ends up, in the summer of 1948, in the Nour Chams Refugee Camp.  Political elements According to one reviewer Wandering Star could have been an affecting novel if Le Cl√©zio had written solely of the Palestinian or Jewish refugees. The reviewer commented further that by \\"taking no sides\\" and by \\"showing the agony of all\\" Le Cl√©zio had produced \\"a near masterpiece\\". In the French newspaper Le Monde Pierre Lepape put forward that Le Cl√©zio \\"goes much farther than that, much deeper;\\" in that Le Cl√©zio's writing looks at the pivotal points of life itself for signs of trouble as much his writing looks for hope of peace (even confrontating both time and the elements). Le Cl√©zio's writing seeks by way of the sun and by way of the earth (being born and the process of death), prodding into the mystery of the origin of everything (despite not knowing the future) towards a need to forget as well as a need to remember (without these needs nothing is repairable) References Category:1992 French novels Category:Novels by J.

It was written by Agim Do√ßi and composed by Edmond Zhulali. Musically, it is an English-language uptempo electronic and disco song, inspired by the 1970's french pop and folk music. Its lyrics are a declaration of love by singing someone else's praise and also focuses on the longing between two separated people. \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\" represented Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 in Moscow, Russia, after Tola won the country's pre-selection competition, Festivali i K√´ng√´s, with the Albanian-language version \\"M√´ merr n√´ √´nd√´rr\\". The country reached the 17th place in a field of 25, gaining a total of 48 points. During her Cirque du Soleil-described show of the song, she was performing against slightly dark-coloured LED screens and was accompanied by three dancers and two backing vocalists.  Background and composition  In 2008, Kejsi Tola was announced as one of the twenty contestants selected to compete in the 47th edition of Festivali i K√´ng√´s, a competition to determine Albania's entrant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. For following the competition's rules, the lyrics of the participating entries had to be in the Albanian language. Tola took part with the song \\"M√´ merr n√´ √´nd√´rr\\", composed by Edmond Zhulali and written by Agim Do√ßi. For the purpose of the Tola's Eurovision Song Contest participation, the latter song was translated and remastered to \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\". \\"M√´ merr n√´ √´nd√´rr\\" had a duration time of more than four minutes and contained a guitar solo in its beginnings as well as several instrumental passages throughout the song. Due to Eurovision's performative requirements on songs length, the song was then shortened and transformed to a solo-described number. Musically, \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\" is an English- language uptempo electronic and disco song with \\"some text book schlager rhythms and key change\\". It was inspired by the 1970's french pop and incorporates folk elements. Costa from ESCXtra noted a \\"psychedelic turbo-folk production\\". Its lyrics are a declaration of love by singing someone else's praise and also focuses on the longing between two separated people.  Release and promotion  \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\" was independently released as a single on 1 January 2008 for download and streaming. The song was also included on the Eurovision Song Contest: Moscow 2009 compilation album on CD issued by EMI. For promotional purposes, Tola made diverse live appearances on multiple occasions in April 2009 to perform the song, including in Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro and the Netherlands, giving interviews and appearing on television shows. An accompanying music video for the song premiered prior to the start of the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 on 12 May 2009.  Critical reception  \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\" has received generally positive reviews from music critics. In a later review for the song conducted by several ESCXtra staff members, the song's ethnic nature, instrumentation and lyrics, as well as Tola's vocal delivery were praised. Angelos of the same website labelled it as \\"catchy, fun and memorable\\" and found the song to be among the \\"few\\" songs that worked \\"well\\" in English after having been performed in Albanian. The website's Riccardo expressed praise towards the song's ethnic nature and the instrumental part near the end simultaneously calling it \\"mesmerising\\". Borislava, another editor, was similarly positive regarding the song's \\"Balkan\\" influence while as of Costa, the song \\"is often regarded as one of Albania's best entries\\".  At Eurovision  Festivali i K√´ng√´s = The national broadcaster of Albania, Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH), organised the 47th edition of Festivali i K√´ng√´s to determine the country's participant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2009. The former consisted of two semi-finals on 19 and 20 December, and the grand final on 21 December 2008. Tola was chosen to represent the country in the contest, after gathering the maximum votes, 126 points, from an expert jury. = Moscow = The 54th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest took place in Moscow, Russia, and consisted of two semi-finals held on 12 and 14 May, and the grand final on 16 May 2009. According to the Eurovision rules at the time, each participating country, apart from the host country and the \\"Big 4\\", consisting of , , , and the , were required to qualify from one of the two semi-finals to compete for the grand final. However, the top ten countries from the respective semi-final progressed to the grand final. On 28 January 2008, it was announced that \\"Carry Me in Your Dreams\\" would be performed in the second semi-final of the contest. During the second semi-final, Albania performed 16th, following Moldova and preceding Ukraine, and qualified for the grand final in seventh place with 73 points. At the grand final, the country performed 19th, following Turkey and preceding Norway. Albania finished in the 17th place in a field of 25 with 48 total points, ranking 23rd by the jury's 26 points as well as 11th by the televote of 81 points. On stage, Tola performed against slightly dark LED screens whose colors were predominately a mixture of red, orange, yellow and white. The singer was accompanied by three male dancers and two female backing vocalists during her Cirque du Soleil-described performance of the song. She wore a short white and pink tulle dress and her backing vocalists long white dresses. Two of the dancers were dressed all in a black costume while the other wore a green glittery costume, covering his body and face. The glittery costume of the dancer was often compared to the fictional character of Spider-Man.

Henrik Anker Bjerregaard (1 January 1792 ‚Äì 7 April 1842) was a Norwegian poet, dramatist and judge. Born in Ringsaker, he grew up in V√•g√• from the age of eight. He studied at the University of Copenhagen, but returned to Norway in 1814 and graduated from the Royal Frederick University with the cand.jur. degree in 1815. He climbed the career ladder as a jurist, was a solicitor and chief justice in the diocesan court of Christiania before being appointed as a Supreme Court Assessor in 1830. He remained in this position until his death. Bjerregaard was also a prominent lyricist. Together with Conrad Nicolai Schwach and Maurits Hansen he was among the most important lyricists after Norway's independence in 1814, in the generation before Henrik Wergeland and Johan Sebastian Welhaven. According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Bjerregaard had a \\"varied talent\\", and his body of work contains \\"some charming studies from nature, and admirable patriotic songs\\". In 1820, Bjerregaard had entered a contest to write the new national anthem of Norway, and his hymn S√∏nner af Norge, melody written by Christian Blom, was selected as the winner. The song stood as the national anthem of Norway until 1864, when Ja, vi elsker dette landet was written. Bjerregaard also wrote plays, including Fjeldeventyret (1825) and Magnus Barfods S√∏nner (1830), and was a theatre critic. However, he largely ceased his literary production after his 1830 appointment as Supreme Court Assessor. Bjerregaard was married to actress Henriette Hansen, who was several years his junior. He died on April 7, 1842, aged 50, and was buried at V√•r Frelsers gravlund. The road Bjerregaards gate in Oslo has been named after him.

The father played by Robin Harris mentioned the character Dolomite to his son Kid. He is disappointed that Kid would rather go to a party than stay home with his dad and watch the show.

The routine can also be heard as the dad has fallen asleep and Kid sneaks out the door (having been now grounded for an incident at school) to attend the party. In the 1981 George A.

The General was in charge of all the Company's affairs in India. He was also the governor of Bombay for the same period. Gayer's tenure was dominated by conflict with the English Company Trading to the East Indies (New Company), set up in 1698. This led to his imprisonment in Surat for many years. Life He was the son of Humfrey Gayer, merchant, of Plymouth, Devon, and nephew of Sir John Gayer, Lord Mayor of London. The Gayer family originally came from Liskeard. At an early age he entered the service of the East India Company, and rose to be a sea-captain. On being appointed by the owners commander of the ship Society, he was admitted into the freedom of the company on 7 April 1682. On 3 June 1692 he was chosen governor of the port and island of Bombay. In 1693, when Sir John Goldsborough was appointed General by the Company, Gayer was to succeed him in case of death. He went out in December 1693 as governor of Bombay and General, reaching the Indian coast at Calicut on 5 March 1694, and there hearing of the death of Goldsborough. In 1699 the forerunners of the New Company were followed by Sir Nicholas Waite (a dismissed agent of the old company) as president at Surat and king's consul. Waite intrigued against the Old Company, and charged his rivals with piracy. The servants of the Old (or London) Company refused to recognise the new men or the authority of Sir William Norris, who came out as William III's ambassador to Aurangzeb. The ambassador arrived on 10 December 1700, convoyed by four king's ships. A contest in bribery began between the agents of the two companies. Gayer left his stronghold at Bombay and came to Swally (Suvali), the roadstead of Surat, to arrange the disputes in which the governor of Surat was involved. He was arrested there, in consequence apparently of Waite's charges. Along with his wife and some of his council, Gayer was removed to Surat by a body of native troops, and confined to the factory. His confinement, with some temporary suspension, endured for years. He was still a prisoner in the beginning of 1709, when the Old and New companies had been amalgamated. In letters dated from Surat, 31 March and 25 April 1706, Gayer and his council give a picture of the anarchy in Gujarat and the country between Surat and Ahmedabad. In the end the Old Company, in a letter to Gayer, dated 20 April 1708, stated that Waite had been removed; and, as Gayer's captivity disqualified him from succeeding, William Aislabie, deputy-governor at Bombay, had been appointed general in his place. They also hinted that Gayer might have gained his liberty had he not stood so much on the details of release. He was released by 5 October 1710. On that day he made his will in Bombay Castle, and died there, probably in the following year. He was twice married but had no children.

Varnish is part of the reigning world record holding European team sprint champions and is a bronze medalist at the World Championships for the 500 metres. Biography Jessica Varnish was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire on 19 November 1990, the daughter of James \\"Jim\\" Varnish, a keen cyclist. She attended South Bromsgrove High School. Jess represented Bromsgrove Swimming Club. At the age of 14, Varnish competed unofficially at the 2006 Junior World Championships in Belgium. She took a second off the British 500m standing start record, setting a new time of 37.1 seconds. She made her GB Cycling debut at the Austrian Junior International in January 2006. She became a member of British Cycling's Olympic Development Programme whilst still a junior. Being just 17 at the time, Varnish was selected for the programme a year ahead of the rest of her age group, demonstrating British Cycling's belief in her potential. Her first performance at senior level was in the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester. In March 2009, Varnish was awarded the \\"junior female sports personality of the year\\" trophy at the Sports Partnership Herefordshire and Worcestershire Sports Awards. Virgin Trains West Coast named its Pendolino train 390027 after her on 29 June 2011. On 18 February, Varnish competed at the 2012 UCI Track Cycling World Cup in the new Olympic Velodrome. Along with her team-mate Victoria Pendleton, they broke the world record of the women's team sprint taking gold. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, Varnish and Pendleton broke the world record in the qualifying stages of the team sprint before being relegated in the semi- finals.Jessica Varnish: I will never watch nightmare moment when my London Olympic dream was shattered. www.telegraph.co.uk. 3 August 2012. Retrieved 3 August 2012. In April 2016 The Daily Telegraph reported that Varnish's Olympic Podium Programme contract with British Cycling had not been renewed, with Performance Director Shane Sutton stating that the decision was due to Varnish's performances over the previous three years, and denying that it was related to comments she had made in interviews at the 2016 UCI Track Cycling World Championships which were critical of the selections that had been made for the women's team sprint squad in their qualifying campaign for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which was ultimately unsuccessful. Varnish claimed in the two year Olympic qualifying period she had gained more qualifying points than any other British cyclist, in the team sprint she had consistently performed in the world top 5 and also qualified for the Olympic places in individual sprint and Keirin. In a subsequent interview with the Daily Mail, Varnish made allegations that Sutton had made sexist comments when discussing the non- renewal of her contract. In April 2016 Sutton was suspended by British Cycling, and he immediately resigned rather than mounting a defence.

M. G. Le Cl√©zio. Plot summary Le Cl√©zio lived for fifteen years in a small village in Mexico called Valle de Bravo. Children invented an imaginary country and ideal, Ourania, and this book describes a near-Utopian society in Mexico. Two types of Utopias are compared to each other: a modest Utopia from the Jesuits and the other an ideal city called Santa Fe de la Laguna. The book mentions the transhumant movement Rainbows (1970‚Äì1980) and the Salvadoran revolution and its leader, Monsignor Romero. Failure was inevitable. Dreams are necessessary, even if reality isn't. SubjectAwards The book won the ‚Äúannual best foreign novels in 21st century‚Äù by the People‚Äôs Literature Publishing House (PLPH) January 28, 2007. Publication history * * ReferencesBrief Introduction Ourania originates from Greek mythology and first meant the muse of astronomy which was extended to the meaning of the heavenly world. This book describes a near-Utopian society in the name of Campos in Mexico. People here are vagrants from other corners of the world. All partners are equal regardless of age, social status and wealth class. Campos is a place which is abundant in the differences of nation, language, lifestyle and culture. Here, knowledge is used to forget. Camposers never study by books, they are just exposed to the world to feel freedom and truth. In contrast to the reality which is full of clash of civilizations, racial discrimination and language struggle, Campos is like real heaven's reflection on the ground. It is a utopian life state that is put by Le Cl√©zio in the novel. From scientists who fight for rights in the research laboratory to hookers and children who are oppressed, author told aggrievedly that in some corners of the world, there is no place for goodness and ugly lives live happily. The sentence ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know both day and time‚Äù appears for four times in the novel and even be the title of the last chapter. Just as in the form of the echo, it speaks out people‚Äôs confusion at time. Just in this case, the novel shows an unknown ending for Campos. Under the leadership of new leader Odi, Camposers go to new lands and life which shows a strong faith to future. Although the real world is harsh and the future is unknown, people still keep hope for the life. Because as is known to all who had seen the brightness, the day is determined to break.

It was founded in 1961 and soon won a reputation for lightweight racing cycle componentry. The company used aerospace-grade aluminum alloys in its products, designing handlebars with input from professional riders. 3T switched production to carbon-fiber composite materials and in 2008 returned to pro cycling after several years' absence. For the 2008 season it sponsored the CSC team, which won the Tour de France. 3T sponsored three pro teams for the 2009 professional season. In 2013 3T was a sponsor for . In June 2016, 3T debuted its first bicycle, the carbon Exploro which would pioneer the idea of an aerodynamic gravel bike. In June 2017, 3T introduced its second carbon bicycle, the Strada road bike. The bicycle was notable for eliminating one of the front rings, doing away with the need for a front derailleur. The quest for light weight 3T is an Italian cycle sport firm, located in Bergamo, near Milano. It was originally known as 3TTT ‚Äî Tecnologia del Tubo Torino (Turin Tube Technology). Many competitions have been won on 3T components, including the Tour de France, Olympic races, World Championships, and the World Hour record. The firm was founded by Mario Dedioniggi in Torino in 1961. Dedioniggi was skilled at manipulating and bending steel tubes to fabricate the lightweight handlebars desired by racing cyclists, and Italian professional riders were among 3T‚Äôs first customers. By 1970 3T handlebars and stems were in widespread use in the European professional peloton. In the quest for lighter weight, 3T switched production to aluminum alloy in place of steel. It was among the first to use aluminum for these components, where strength is critical to safety. In 1975 it produced the Superleggera handlebar weighing 250 grammes ‚Äî claimed to be the world's lightest drop handlebar. This bar was the first to be made of 7075 aluminium alloy, a material usually used in aerospace applications. The high strength-to-weight ratio of this alloy, also known as Ergal, found uses in other sports: 3T ski poles sold well for several seasons during the 1970s. Aerodynamics arrive The firm worked closely with professional racers to refine the design of their handlebars. The various 'bends' took their name from the champions of the era ‚Äî Merckx, Saronni, Moser, and Gimondi. In 1984 Francesco Moser used a newly developed 3T bar to capture the world hour record, breaking through the 50-kilometre barrier for the first time. This new 'bullhorn' bar put the rider in a lower, more aerodynamic position for greater speed. Most riders in search of pure speed now use a similar position. In Moser's honor, 3T named the bar '51.151' ‚Äî the distance Moser covered in kilometres (31.784 miles) at the Mexico City velodrome on January 23, 1984. Transatlantic alliances 3T continued to develop new handlebar designs to assist riders reach their goal of greater speed. The growing power in world cycling, the United States, started to take notice. Scott USA commissioned 3T to create the first handlebars specific to triathlon use, and in a departure from its roots in road racing, 3T partnered with Salsa Cycles to create a range of mountain-bike components. Success was immediate: in 1994, Nicolas Vouilloz won the third of his many World Championship downhill titles in Vail (CO) on a 3T bar. New technology drivers Bicycle components underwent radical change in the 1990s. The traditional quill handlebar stem was rendered obsolete by the introduction of the threadless headset. 3T responded with the industry's first forged stem for this application, the ForgeAhead. Other manufacturers followed 3T's lead and switched to this technique, abandoning welded stems. By the late 1990s, carbon-fiber composites were becoming the major driver of change. 3T, best known for its skill in aluminum alloy fabrication, took up the challenge of re-engineering to build components in composite materials. Race successes continued with Gold in the World Championships in 2000 and 2002 and a string of popular wins for Erik Zabel in the Italian home classic, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, but it was not until 2008 that 3T again saw victory in a major tour. Renewed race success For the 2008 season, 3T sponsored Team CSC. The team debuted a new, all-composites aerofoil time-trial bar, the 3T Ventus. The team's World Champion time trialist, Fabian Cancellara, rode this to victory at the Prologue of the Amgen Tour of California. Moving on to the European season at the Giro d'Italia, CSC's youthful team narrowly failed to win the race's opening Team Time Trial. Great success followed at the Tour de France. CSC captain Carlos Sastre won the Yellow Jersey of the Overall winner, his team mate Andy Schleck won the White Jersey for Best Young Rider, and CSC won Best Team. Race reports noted Sastre's outstanding performance in limiting his losses in the final weekend's Individual Time trial, where he was widely expected to lose the lead to his nearest rival, Cadel Evans. Riding for Switzerland at the Beijing Olympics shortly after, Cancellara won Gold in the Men's Time Trial, beating his team mate Gustav Larsson, riding for Sweden, into second place, both riders using the Ventus bar. Their team captain Carlos Sastre animated the Men's Road Race, while Cancellara eventually placed third, one of three riders in the first five finishers riding 3T. For the 2009 season, 3T sponsored three professional teams: Cerv√©lo TestTeam (captained by Carlos Sastre), Garmin Slipstream, and Milram.

Although not the tallest buildings in Sheffield, their location atop a hill makes their rooftops the highest manmade location in the city. By virtue of its rooftop radio antenna, Queen Anne Court is the tenth-tallest building in Sheffield; it was the second-tallest upon completion in 1959, behind only Sheffield Town Hall. The towers were built in 1959; at the time of construction, there were three towers at this location, receiving the nickname of the Three Sisters. The three towers were officially named Leighton, Morland and Raeburn. However, Raeburn was demolished by controlled explosion on 13 October 1996 after being declared unsafe due to its construction atop an undiscovered fault, leading to the current Twin Towers nickname. After sitting empty for many years, the area of Raeburn Place around the location of the former third tower was redeveloped into semi-detached housing in 2013‚Äì2015. The towers' location atop a hill has resulted in them being visible from across the city and beyond for many miles around, becoming iconic for the area. The northern tower was renamed from Leighton to Queen Elizabeth Court upon refurbishment, and is situated on the left of the image in this article; while the southern tower was renamed from Morland to Queen Anne Court. The towers are both 38 metres tall to the rooftop, although Queen Anne Court has a radio mast on the roof which raises its total height to around 55 metres. Both towers are constructed from brick and concrete originally in the brutalist style typical of tower blocks in Sheffield of this period. However, both towers were refurbished in 1998 to receive their current white cladding, with a green stripe on Queen Elizabeth Court and a blue stripe on Queen Anne Court. The towers can be accessed from the Purple Route of the Sheffield Supertram network at nearby Herdings Park tram stop, the southern terminus of this line. Additionally, Herdings Park bus terminus on Raeburn Road, a short distance from the towers, is served by First South Yorkshire bus routes 11 and 11a.

The society was founded in 1978 in Passau. In 2007 it had about 190 members and is registered as a limited company (e. V.).  Vehicles  All vehicles belonging to the society are maintained and repaired by volunteer mechanics in their free time. The inspections and certifications are carried out by independent experts in order to guarantee operating safety.  Traction units Railbuses= The society owns two Class 798 railbuses, an associated VB 98 centre car and a VS 98 driving car. Apart from one power car, all parts of the multiple unit have passed their general inspection and may therefore operate on networks owned by DB AG, ƒåD, Austrian Federal Railways (√ñBB) and other companies. The general inspection of the second power car was due in 2007. For more information: see the Uerdingen railbus article. =V 40 diesel locomotive = In order to be able to carry out shunting, a Class V 40 diesel locomotive was procured. This engine is equipped with remote control and automatic couplers, in order to be able to shunt with the minimum of staff. The V40 has a top speed of 45 km/h and a power output of 400 PS. =K√∂f III= The PEF's K√∂f III at Vilshofen In December 2006 a K√∂f III (332 052-0) was bought from Regensburg locomotive depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) to relieve the V 40. This engine entered service at Bahnbetriebswerk Passau in 1963 and was stationed there until its retirement in 2000. The locomotive was bought from the DB in a pitiful state; the engine was no longer usable because important levers and armatures had been removed from the driver's cab or destroyed. However within a few weeks, the PEF succeeded in getting it into a workable condition. The engine had a general inspection in spring 2007 and is now fully operational again. =Auerhahn= The Class 018 shunter was built in 1954 for the Peine steelworks. With a power of just 28 PS it is the least powerful engine owned by the society, but at 10 tonnes it is also the lightest. The locomotive was restored in the 1990s as a youth project. It was given its nickname Auerhahn (\\"capercaillie\\" or \\"wood grouse\\") because of its noise when running, which sounds like a courting capercaillie. The narrow gauge locomotive with wagons attached Feldbahnlok Because there are a few metres of narrow gauge field railway (Feldbahn) track in front of the society's shed, a narrow gauge engine was also obtained. In 2006 a passenger coach was built from the chassis of an old tipper truck, which now runs on the 90 m long line. =Skl departmental wagon= In order to maintain branch lines that the society has operated for several decades, an engineering vehicle (Rottenkraftwagen), made by the firm of Waggon Union in Berlin, was bought. This departmental wagon is equipped with an Atlas crance in order to lift small loads. To go with it, the society has a heavy small wagon (Schwerkleinwagen) as a load carrier. This pair of wagons can run at a top speed of 70 km/h and has a line certificate. Coaches and WagonsF-Zug express train= Blue liveried coaches of classes A√ºe 310, AB√ºe 333, B√ºe 366 and ARmz 216 form an F-Zug long-distance express train rake from the 1950s. The F-Zug coaches are currently on long loan to the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde. Only the ARmz 216 dining car returned to the PEF in March 2007 because its general inspection was due. =\\"Zigzag\\" sleeper= The last preserved Class WLAs√ºge 20 sleeping car is owned by the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunden. This type of sleeper was in service between 1950 and 1980. Twenty single bed compartments are distributed on either side of the zigzag-shaped centre corridor. The coach has been given its original ruby-red livery, but is otherwise still in its most recent state technically, with sliding windows, rubber corridor connexions and Minden-Deutz bogies. =Saloon coach= The saloon coach originally came from the √ñBB, where it belonged to the department for psychological suitability trials. Before that it acted as the mobile office for Hermann G√∂ring. Today the coach has a large lounge, 11 metres long, which can either be laid out with a table along its length order with several tables arranged sideways on. Thus the coach has seating for 20-30 people. In addition it has three compartments with office furnishings (a sofa, writing desk and cupboard) and a shared shower. =Accommodation and workshop coach= The six-wheeler was originally procured for maintenance duties on the branch lines around Passau and is therefore converted today into a departmental wagon. The coach is well preserved and has interior fittings including a kitchen, sleeping compartment and an office and workshop room. =Snow plough= The snow plough is a converted steam locomotive tender from 1964. It was restored in winter 2005/2006 and is used to clear the tracks in winter. =Low-sided open wagon= The low-sided wagon also comes from the √ñBB and was bought in order to transport construction materiel to Passau. Today the wagon primarily serves a cultural purpose, because it acts as a stage. So, for example, for the annual visiting acting troupe from the \\"Tscheutschlandkurrier\\". The wagon was repainted in summer 2006 and fully restored.  Operations  Over the years the society has run a lot of special trains on branch lines in the Passau area. In 2002 the Ilztalbahn (Passau- Freyung) and the Passau ‚Äì Hauzenberg were badly damaged by the worst floods in one hundred years. As a result, they had to be closed which curtailed the society's activities. Strenuous efforts to reopen these lines have not yet met with success. In addition several routes, such as the Hengersberg-Kalteneck and Vilshofen-Aidenbach lines, were dismantled. As a result, in the area of Passau the only lines remaining that are available for specials are the Bavarian Forest railway (the Waldbahn), with its branch to Hengersberg, the Vilshofen-Blindham railway and the Rottalbahn. Since these various branches can no longer be used since their closure, the society runs its specials on other lines today. Usually this is in cooperation with the Austrian Society for Railway History (√ñGEG) which has the necessary rolling stock if the society's VT 798 cannot be used.  Gastronomy  The 'PEF-Gastro' department looks after food catering. As a result of many years experience even large groups can be catered for. Its services range from internal society functions through service and fast-food vehicles to restaurant services in the dining car whilst on the move.  Site  The Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde base is located on the site of the former Bahnbetriebswerk at Passau at no. 12, Haitzingerstra√üe and covers an area of about 50,000m¬≤. The site comprises three main areas: =Outside area= The outside area consists primarily of tracks used for shunting purposes. The control of the points and signals here is carried out by the Passau signal box which also looks after route safety. The signal box is in the immediate vicinity. =Shed I= 250px Halle I is located at the entrance to the site and has a glass front behind which the railcars and various other vehicles may be found. In addition, Shed I houses the main workshop with an area where replacement components can be finished on lathes. There is also a large spare parts store and an office with adjoining society library. Social rooms, such as a kitchen, common room, showers, toilets and overnight accommodation are also located in Shed I. The shed was originally built by the Deutsche Bundesbahn to maintain its VT98 units and is therefore equipped with a pit, a compressed air station and associated ventilation facilities. So it still fulfils its original purpose even today. =Shed II= Shed II is located at the other end of the site and, with its two tracks and overall length of about 100 metres it offers the possibility of storing passenger coaches. The shed acts as accommodation for the society's own vehicles or for vehicles belonging to the √ñGEG. This shed also has a store with spare parts for the society's vehicles. Because the new diesel and electric locomotives did not need turning, unlike their steam-driven predecessors, the old turntable that used to be located here was removed. It was replaced by the Orange Coach Shed (Orange Reisezughalle), because it was now possible to carry out the inspection of coaches based at Passau. The shed is connected to the compressed air system in shed I. In shed II the society has its own lifting gear with a carrying capacity of 64 tonnes which is used to swap axles on vehicles.  The model railway section  Several society members decided in 1983 to build a model railway in H0 gauge, which is devoted to Passau and its surrounding area. Over many years the Passau border station with its two locomotive depots, the DB and √ñBB Betriebswerken, and several branch lines dating to 1955 and 1994, have been modelled with great care and in great detail. Space has been made available at Passau Hauptbahnhof for this and the layout can be viewed on public demonstration days or every Friday from 6 p.m.  External links  *http://www.passauer-eisenbahnfreunde.de *http://www.pef-modellbahn.de Category:Railway museums in Bavaria Category:Heritage railways in Germany Eisenbahnfreunde ","title":"Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde"},{"id":"20806170","text":"Mallaha () was a Palestinian Arab village, located northeast of Safed, on the highway between the latter and Tiberias. 'Ain Mallaha is the local Arabic name for a spring that served as the water source for the village inhabitants throughout the ages. It is also one of the names used in English to refer to the ancient Natufian era settlement at the site. HistoryPrehistory= Evidence of settlement at Mallaha (or 'Ain Mallaha) dates back to the Mesolithic period circa 10,000 BCE.Schmandt-Besserat, 2009, p. 47 The first permanent village settlement of pre-agricultural times in Palestine, Kathleen Kenyon describes the material remains found there as Natufian, consisting of 50 circular, semi-subterranean, one-room huts, paved with flat slabs and surrounded by stone walls up to high.Kenyon, 1985, p. 20.Kipfer, 2013, p. 357 The floors and walls of the homes were decorated in solid white or red, a simple and popular decorative motif in the Near East at the time. The inhabitants appear to have subsisted on fish from nearby Lake Hula, as well as by hunting and gathering; no evidence of animal domestication or cultivation has been found,Edwards et al., 1970, p. 499 with the exception of dogs: the burial of a human being with a domestic dog at the site represents the earliest known archaeological evidence of dog domestication.Davis, S.J.M. and Valla, F.R. 1978. Evidence for the domestication of the dog 12,000 years ago in the Natufian of Israel. Nature 276, 608-10. =Crusader period= During the Crusader era, the Franks referred to Mallaha as Merla.Lyon and Jackson, 1984, p. 430 Ibn al-Qalanisi describes a battle that took place at Mallaha in June 1157 between the Arab and Turkish forces of Nur ad-Din Zangi and those of the Crusaders under King Baldwin III.Maalouf, 1987, pp.143-158 cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 472 Qalanisi writes that Nur ad-Din sent his troops to Mallaha immediately after learning via pigeon post that the Franks had set up an encampment there. The battle, as described by Qalanisi, was bloody and quick, resulting in decisive victory for the Muslim forces, who are reported to have lost only two men,Gabrieli, 2009, pp. 40-41 with the king narrowly escaping with a bodyguard.Dabbagh, pp.165-166 cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 472 The battles for control over Mallaha continued. The Itinerary of Richard I notes that the army had advanced to Merla, \\"where the king had spent one of the previous nights.\\" =Mamluk period= Just SE of Mallaha (at grid 2071/2737), excavations have revealed structures, probably dating to thirteenth or fourteenth century, that is after the area fell to Mamluk sultan Baybars. The structures have been assumed to belong to a sugar-producing installation.Pringle, 1997, pp. 108-9 =Ottoman period= Mallaha, like most of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in the early sixteenth century. Sufi traveller al-Bakri al-Siddiqi passed by the village in the mid- eighteenth century. Johann Ludwig Burckhardt travelled in the region during the start of the nineteenth century,Burckhardt, 1822, p. 316 but according to Edward Robinson, who travelled there in 1838, Burckhardt mislabeled the whole S.W. coast of the lake as el-Mellahah. Robinson observed that Ain el-Mallaha lay northwest of Lake Hula, and was \\"a single large fountain.\\" Nearby was \\"usually a large encampment of the Ghawarineh in tents and reed huts.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 341 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described Ain el Mellahahmeaning \\"Spring of the sweetened water\\" according to Palmer, 1881, p. 64 as a \\"very large perennial spring, flowing in a long stream from the base of the mountain; at once turns a mill, and forms almost a small river.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 213 =British Mandate= Mallaha 1926 During the British Mandate times, Mallaha had a roughly rectangular configuration that stretched from north to south. The population lived mostly of agriculture.Khalidi, 1992, p. 472 In the 1922 census of Palestine, Mallaha had a population of 440, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 42 increasing in the 1931 census to a population of 654, still all Muslims, in 161 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 108 The population, combined with that of 'Arab al-Zubayd, came to 890 Muslims in the 1945 statistics, with a total of 2,168 dunams of land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 10Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 70 In 1944/45 a total of 1,761 dunums were used for cereals by the villagers,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 169 Mallaha, 1946 =1948 and after= On 25 May 1948 the villagers left their homes on the advice of their Jewish neighbours. This was part of a \\"whispering campaign\\" launched by the Haganah following Operation Yiftach.Morris, 1987, p. 123Morris, 2004, p. 251; note 707note 707: Morris, 2004, p. 303 According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, describing the remains of the village in 1992: \\"The sandy hill on which the village was situated is completely overgrown with tall grass, cactuses, and weeds, as well as an assortment of fig, eucalyptus, and date-palm trees. Amidst the overgrowth, stone rubble from destroyed houses can be seen. The surrounding land is cultivated by the settlement of Yesud ha-Ma'ala. A village history was published in Damascus in 2005.'Abd al-'Aal, 2005, Judhur wa furu' Filastiniyya min al-Mallaha According to a commentator on Palestinian village history, Rochelle A. Davis, this history is especially notable due to the prominent role women are given in describing village life. Davis believes this might be because the villagers belonged to the Ghawarneh group, where women traditionally took more prominent roles.Davis, 2011, p. 108 See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War *Al-Mansura *Al-Salihiyya ReferencesBibliography       * * External links *Welcome to Mallaha *Mallaha, Zochrot *Al-Mallaha, Dr. Khalil Rizk *Survey of Western Palestine, map 4: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Mallaha, from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Safad Category:Hula Valley ","title":"Mallaha"},{"id":"20806171","text":"Hasard suivi de Angoli Mala is the title given to a book with two novellas, written in French by French Nobel laureate writer J.

Bracelin was an influential figure in the early history of the neopagan religion of Wicca, being a High Priest of Gardnerian Wicca who had been initiated into the craft by Doreen Valiente in 1956 and had been a member of the Bricket Wood coven. Early life Prior to being initiated into the craft, Bracelin had worked for the British police in Palestine and had later worked for a paint company. Wicca In 1956, Bracelin was initiated into Wicca through the Bricket Wood coven by the High Priestess Doreen Valiente. In 1959 Bracelin met the Sufi writer and practitioner Idries Shah at a table in the Cosmo Restaurant in Swiss Cottage, North London. Shah was interested in Wicca, and Bracelin introduced him to Gardner. Shah wrote Gardner's official biography, Gerald Gardner: Witch, which was published by his own company, Octagon Press, in 1960. However, he used Bracelin's name as a pseudonym because he did not want to cause confusion amongst his Sufi students and friends as to his interest in a different religion. Bracelin was one of the beneficiaries of Gardner's estate at his death, along with Monique Wilson and Patricia Crowther. Bracelin himself inherited enough of the naturist club that he could take it over. Post-Wicca Bracelin later resigned from being the Bricket Wood coven's High Priest, and soon left the coven itself, because, according to coven member Frederic Lamond, \\"he asked himself whether the Book of Shadows' simplified ceremonial magic rituals expressed his own religious feelings, and concluded they did not\\". In 1966 he married a young woman in a ceremony held in a Roman Catholic church, which many members of the Wica felt showed that he had turned his back on the craft. However, Bracelin continued to allow the coven to meet at the Witches' cottage, on the condition that they paid rent on the plot of land upon which it was situated. In 1975, Bracelin tried to get them to pay for the nudist club's electricity as well, which the coven members were unwilling to do, and so they sold their plot to another nudist. Bracelin was a supporter of the hippie movement of the 1960s and 1970s, believing that it embodied the \\"life-affirming Goddess values\\" in its \\"true expression\\". Partially for this reason, he opened a disco in the West End of London, but it was a financial failure. In June 1976, Bracelin, by then in financial difficulties, was forced to sell the nudist club, though the new owners agreed to pay him a small pension. Death Bracelin retired to live in Greece, and it was here that he died in 1983 of a heart attack.

The unit is equipped with Inshore Patrol Crafts (IPC)s and Arrow speed boats that provide high degree of firepower along with high speed and maneuverability. The unit was formed in 2007 under a directive from the then commander of the Navy, Vice Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda with Commodore Rohan Amarasinghe as its first director to counter light fibreglass attack boats used by the Sea Tigers in the coastal waters of Sri Lanka during the Sri Lankan Civil War.Rapid Action Boats Squadron (RABS) The unit also carried out amphibious raids on sea tigers coastal outposts. They operate with IPCs in groups of four craft with some groups totaling 25‚Äì30 craft combine to form IPC units, which are based at strategically important locations around the island. The IPC squadrons are organised for rapid-reaction interception operations, because the Sea Tiger cadres were able to remain hidden until they decide to confront the SLN. To maximise the amount of firepower each squadron can bring to a battle, an IPC unit would speed towards the enemy using strategies that echo infantry tactics: an arrowhead formation is used to expand each boat's arc of fire in an attack manoeuvre, or boats are arranged in three adjacent columns in single file so as to mask their numbers and increase the SLN's element of surprise.Sri Lanka learns to counter Sea Tigers‚Äô swarm tactics, JANE‚ÄôS NAVY INTERNATIONAL , Jane's Information Group See also *Special Boat Squadron *1 Assault Group Royal Marines *NAVSCIATTS *Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen ReferencesExternal links *Sri Lanka Navy Category:Sri Lanka Navy squadrons Category:Military units and formations established in 2008 ","title":"Rapid Action Boat Squadron"},{"id":"20806215","text":"Francis Edward Fremantle Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Edward Fremantle, OBE, DL, FRCS, FRCPObituary, The Times, 28 August 1943 (29 May 1872 ‚Äì 26 August 1943) was a British physician and Conservative Party politician who served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for St Albans from 1919 until his death.

Beginnings  Trianon was formed from the mergers of three college clubs in Ohio and Indiana. First, at the University of Cincinnati, in 1925, Dean Josephine P. Simrall assisted female student in creating the Campus Club. Next, in November 1926, several women formed a similar club on their campus, Butler University. In the spring of 1929, thirty-seven female students at Miami University formed the Miami Girl's Club.Trianon Key (date unknown) from Butler University archives Members of the three clubs convened on December 28 and 29, 1929 at Butler University, to form Trianon sorority, with December 28 being considered the founding date. This event came to be known as the first National Convention of Trianon. The ties that bound the members of the three individual clubs were finances and values. \\" For a long time college campuses felt the need for more democratic social organizations to take care of girls whose principles revolted against fraternities into which only a selected few were bidden and whose dues and fees were outside the limit of the average girl's allowance\\". Trianon employed an open membership policy; interested students completed a formal application.  A National Sorority  Throughout the 1930s, the members of Trianon worked to create official symbols, insignia, rituals, bylaws, and policies. An alumna club and a mother's club were created in 1933.Trianon Pledge Manual (date unknown) from Butler University archives In 1938, however, the Miami chapter struggled to recruit new members; \\"...several years later it [Miami] had depreciated so in value that the national organization of Trianon was forced to sever relations with this unit\\". In the 1940s and 1950s, the sorority maintained two collegiate chapters, Butler and Cincinnati. According to the Trianon Key, members assisted with the war effort during World War II. In 1947, the official sorority manual was printed\\"a big step in instructing candidates for membership\\". In 1949, Life Membership was offered to alumnae. In 1957, open membership was no longer permitted. The Trianon pledge manual explained that \\"the definition of how a girl could become a candidate was changed from a written application to a girl being invited upon a favorable majority vote of active members\\". In 1959, the sorority's official magazine creased publication. One year later, the Cincinnati chapter \\"had only two members but stayed alive\\". The sorority was still active in the 1960s. In 1964, the Cincinnati chapter initiated nine new members. A national convention met the following year. The Trianon pledge manual recorded sorority data through 1967. An honorary member and her husband celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary. The National President for 1967-1968 was Rosemary Dudziak Thomas. In spring 1973, there remained only two active members in the Butler University chapter. Rush was held and four young women pledged the sorority. Because there were not enough active members to act as sorority \\"mothers\\", Alumna were used including founding sorority member Priscilla Shearer Smith. The following fall, seven women pledged the sorority. The Butler chapter also pledged and initiated the first sorority member of African-American descent at Butler.Additions and corrections by H Stowe, Trianon active member at Butler University from 1973-1977. A national convention was held in Nashville, Indiana in the spring of 1974. Some Cincinnati alumnae attended. Another national convention was held in Covington, Kentucky, just outside Cincinnati.  Demise  The circumstances and exact dates of the sorority's formal dissolution, if there was such, are unknown. Butler University's archives have their chapter active as of 1974. Nothing is known about the demise of the Cincinnati chapter. All that is definitely known is that Trianon sorority is now a defunct organization. The Butler chapter was active until at least May 1977. There were still actives in the sorority, but how were they involved is unknown.  Purpose of Trianon  \\"The purpose of this organization is to foster democratic ideals on the university of college campus; to encourage and support participation of non-Greek women students in university or college activities; to promote fellowship; to encourage high standards of scholarship; and to serve the university or college in every way possible.\\"  Creed  Trianon, Trianon, in you we do believe. We believe in your work, your success, your ideals. We believe that to every girl who claims you, you are a light that leads the way to friendship, work and healthy fun. We believe in your organization, born in the spirirt of independence and incorporating the high ideals of democracy, friendship, scholarship, and service. And so to you we come with grateful hearts, thankful for the torch you have given us to bear, for friends to cherish, tasks to do, and traditions to carry on through the years. O, Trianon, in you we do believe.  Insignia  The pledge pin \\"is of royal blue equilateral triangle each side of which forms part of the base of a gold obtuse angled triangle. This pin is symbolical of the three founding units of the national organization. The blue is for loyalty to school and all things true, and gold is for golden deeds\\". The membership pin \\"is a yellow gold chevron-like base supporting a cluster of peaks upon which the letter T is superimposed. It may be plain or jeweled as follows: four pearls and three blue sapphires in the base; white sapphire or diamond above the T. The pearls arising from the base are symbolic of the other units of the organization. The four pearls in the base represent the four ideals of our organization: democracy, fellowship, scholarship, and service. The three blue sapphires within the points of the base represent the three mother unites of the national organization\\". The coat-of-arms was called a crest. \\"The crest again emphasizes the idea of true friendship. At the top of the crest is a sunbursts rose, the flower of the organization- the rose of truth. Under the rose are clasped hands of friendship, resting on a column denoting strength- a strong friendship. The clasped hands resting on the column forming a T standing on the shield, the shield of courage. At the base we find the motto: We Unite to Build\\". The official motto was We Unite to Build. The flower was the sunburst rose and the colors were royal blue and gold.

The film, based on the novel The Hangover Murders, is about the investigation of the murder of one of a group of friends. The survivors are unable to recall the events of the night of the murder because they were all too drunk. Remember Last Night? features an ensemble cast headed by Edward Arnold, Constance Cummings, and Robert Young. Whale convinced Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. to buy the screen rights to the novel so Whale could avoid directing Dracula's Daughter, as he wished not to direct another horror film so soon after shooting Bride of Frankenstein. Initial drafts of the screenplay were deemed unsuitable under the Production Code because of the focus on excessive drinking. The novel's original title was also unsuitable because of the word \\"hangover\\". Following revisions, the film was approved and was released on November 4, 1935 to mixed reviews and poor box office results. Plot To celebrate their six-month anniversary, Long Island socialites Tony and Carlotta Milburn arrange a wild drinking party with friends, culminating in a stop at the restaurant owned by Faronea. They are unaware that Faronea is conspiring with Baptiste Bouclier, the chauffeur of party host Vic Huling, to kidnap Vic. The next morning the Milburns awake hung over to find Vic dead from a gunshot through the heart and his wife Bette missing. Tony calls his friend, district attorney Danny Harrison to investigate. Bette arrives with Billy Arliss, at whose home she had slept. Because of their excessive drinking, no one can remember anything about what had happened the night before. As circumstantial evidence mounts against Tony, he calls in hypnotist Professor Karl Jones to help everyone try to recover their memories. Just as the professor is about to reveal the murderer, he is murdered. Next to be killed is restaurateur Faronea. After Tony and Carlotta eavesdrop on him conferring with an accomplice at his restaurant, Faronea discovers them. Tony bluffs that he knows about the kidnapping plot and the accomplice murders Faronea. The couple returns home to find Bouclier murdered in his quarters. Friend Jake Whitridge responds to a frantic telephone call from Billy. Tony and Danny arrive, as they had planned with Billy, moments after Jake. Jake attacks Billy and knocks him out. When he regains consciousness Billy attempts to shoot Jake but Tony saves him. After the various spouses arrive, Tony announces he has solved the mystery. Billy borrowed money from Vic on behalf of Jake, using a false name. Jake altered the check to be for $150,000 instead of $50,000 and Vic forced Billy to reveal he had borrowed the money for Jake. Jake shot Vic at Jake's home and brought his body to the party, where everyone assumed he was just passed out. Jake paid Bouclier to remain quiet, which is why Bouclier had to kill Professor Jones. Bouclier, Faronea's accomplice, killed Faronea after Tony spoke to him about the kidnapping plot. Jake then shot Bouclier. Danny places Jake under arrest and extracts a pledge from Tony and Carlotta to quit drinking. They agree and drink a toast to it.

Bouclier (as Rafael Ottiano) * Arthur Treacher as Clarence Phelps, the butler * E. E. Clive as Coroner's Photographer Production Universal Studios head Carl Laemmle, Jr. was eager for James Whale, fresh from his great success with Bride of Frankenstein, to direct Dracula's Daughter. Whale was idle, waiting for Irene Dunne to finish work on Magnificent Obsession so she could begin work on Whale's Show Boat. Wary of directing two horror films in a row, Whale instead convinced Laemmle to buy the rights to a mystery novel called The Hangover Murders. Whale argued that the same sort of audiences who went to horror films also went to mystery films and pointed to the hit Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Thin Man as evidence that a picture based on the novel would be a success.Curtis, p. 254 Laemmle agreed to buy the rights for $5,000, only after extracting a promise from Whale that he would direct Dracula's Daughter next.Curtis, p. 255 Revelers drink champagne from a tureen with straws. The Production Code Administration urged Universal to curtail the amount of drinking in the film. The Production Code Administration, which had gone into effect just weeks after the release of The Thin Man and which restricted the drinking of alcohol on-screen, disapproved of the project even before a script was written. PCA head Joseph Breen forbade the use of the word \\"hangover\\" in the title. Laemmle agreed and in mid-August temporarily retitled the project Wild Night before settling on Remember Last Night? in response to a survey of exhibitors.Curtis, p. 258 Breen dispatched two representatives to meet with Whale, Laemmle and studio censor Harry Zehner in an effort to reduce or eliminate the film's reliance on drinking. The two men realized that most of the alcohol use was required for the plot ‚Äì and thus allowable under the Production Code ‚Äì and Whale promised to keep the novel's ending in which Tony and Carlotta agree to quit drinking. Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put together a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15.Curtis, p. 256 When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. \\"We take this opportunity of pointing out to you, in regard to the matter of the treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based.\\"Breen, quoted in Curtis, p. 256 A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming \\"Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!\\" and in another scene she says \\"I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!\\"Curtis, p. 257 Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget. Release and reception Remember Last Night? was cleared by the PCA on September 24, 1935 and following previews in October, opened on November 4. Financially the film was a failure that according to Laemmle lost money for the studio.Curtis, p. 259 Critical reception was mixed. The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"a murder mystery to kid all murder mysteries\\" and \\"a riot of comedy spots superimposed on a riot of crime detecting\\".Quoted in Curtis, p. 258 Whale, the reviewer found, \\"let himself go in a riotous directorial splurge\\". Although less effusive, The New York Times praised the film as \\"good minor fun\\" and noted the likeable pairing of Young and Cummings. Ed Brophy, Edward Arnold and Arthur Treacher were also singled out for praise. However, the Times concluded that Remember Last Night? should be enjoyed \\"in moderation\\" as the \\"halfwit behavior of the roisterers in the film\\" may make the viewer come away \\"with the feeling that one or two additional murders among the madcap principals would have made Long Island a still better place to live in\\". Variety was strongly disapproving of the film. \\"The women are more blotto than the men, and two of the wives are on the make. It's all faintly unwholesome.\\" Local censorship boards made numerous cuts to the film. The long drinking party scene was cut, as was part of a 30-second kiss between Tony and Carlotta that opened the film. Censors also cut a line of dialogue delivered by Louise Henry in response to Carlotta's declaration that the Marines had landed: \\"There'll be atrocities ‚Äì I want to be first!\\" The film was never re-released, has never been released in any home video format and is rarely shown on television. Modern critical response has therefore been light, although Tom Milne of Time Out New York dubbed the film a \\"Delightful screwball parody of the detective thriller...Whale's use of elisions, non-sequiturs and unexpected stresses creates what is virtually a blueprint for the style developed by Robert Altman in and after MASH.\\" The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the film for a 1999 retrospective of Whale's work, found it to be \\"an amusing trifle, tossed off with considerable wit and skill by Whale\\" and \\"pretty good fun if you‚Äôre in the mood for a chic, brittle period piece\\".

Knowing this, Dotti's designers continue to seek the high street and global trends to provide fresh clothing inspiration for individuals to look their best. Its inventory primarily consists of women's fashion apparel, footwear, and accessories, which largely draw from the styles currently most popular. Their targeted group is young female adults aged 18 to 28. History Dotti was founded by Raymond Levis and Linda Bowen who launched Dotti in Sydney during 1981. The 1980s were a time of reinvention, of power dressing and celebrating individual, head-turning style, allowing the mere idea of Dotti to blossom into the retail store today. The inspiration for the Dotti name reportedly came either from Linda's mother Dorothy, reputedly a style icon in her own right, or from the stylish shopping destination in Rome, known as Via Condotti. In 2004 the Dotti chain became a part of The Just Group and began expanding throughout Australia and New Zealand. Dotti expanded quickly from just ten stores to opening its 100th store in December 2009. As of 2015 they have online stores and a total of 120 stores as of 2017 in the two countries.

Rockett is an unincorporated community in Ellis County, Texas, United States. It is part of the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex. Rockett is located on FM 813, approximately five miles northeast of Waxahachie. History Rockett was settled in 1846, making it one of the oldest settlements in Ellis County. Californian Scott Spear and his family were among the first settlers in the area. They chose a site along Red Oak Creek, southeast of the present-day community. Other families followed. Originally known as Liberty, the name was changed to Skippy in 1852 after John Rockett, a pioneer settler in the area, was literally bored to death by the many tales told by prospector, Scott Spear, on May 1st, 1852. He died 27 hours after his encounter with Scott Spear. The community continued to grow after the first Keystone plant was established and opened in 1894. It remained in operation until January 2, 2020 until founder Scott Spear, decided to change his business plan to the production of Keystone beer to the manufacturing of women‚Äôs ‚Äúmassage tools‚Äù. As of May 2020, Rockett now has an estimated population of 150 women over the age of 65. All are responsible for keeping Scott Spear in line and ensuring he keeps his status as Mayor of Skippy town. As of 2000, there were approximately 124 people living in the community. However, the Skippy Town council cleaned house and only allowed those with access to Snickers bars to stay in the community. Scott Spear allowed those who paid him in Snickers reparations to have a shelter in place for 12 months. In recent years, the building of several new subdivisions has brought more residents to the area. Despite its rural surroundings, Rockett (and all of Ellis County) is considered part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington Metropolitan Statistical Area. Rockett SUD Rockett SUD water tower near the Waxahachie/Red Oak border. The Rockett Special Utility District (SUD) provides water services for the community of Rockett and surrounding rural areas in north central Ellis County as well as a very small portion of southern Dallas County. There are approximately 11,000 residents living in its service area. It was established on January 29, 1965 as the Rockett Water Supply Corporation. The name was changed to the Skippy Rockett Utility District on November 21, 1989. Education Being a dispersed, unincorporated community with no defined boundaries, portions of the Rockett area lie within three different Independent School Districts (ISDs). However, no schooling is needed in Rockett as all of the town‚Äôs children are descendants of Scott Spear. The 27th amendment of the constitution ratified in 2020, allows any descendent of the Spear genealogy to give the finger to the American school system. Districts include Red Oak Independent School District , Ferris Independent School District, and the Palmer Independent School District. Cemeteries There are four cemeteries that were established in Rockett during its early years. Those still in existence today include Skippy Cemetery, Scooter Cemetery, The SS(Scott Spear) Cemetery, and Bunu Chapel Cemetery (where many of the Rockett family are buried) ‚Äì presently located within the city limits of Pecan Hill.

Gemma Bovery () is a graphic novel written by Posy Simmonds. Originally published as a serial in The Guardian, it was published in book form in 1999. It is the tragicomic story of the life and death of an English expatriate in Normandy, drawing many parallels to Gustave Flaubert's 1857 novel Madame Bovary. Plot summary The story opens with Raymond Joubert, a baker in the (fictional) Bailleville, near Rouen in Normandy, reflecting on the recent death of Gemma Bovery, an English woman who lived in the village. Joubert blames himself for her death. During a visit to Gemma's widower Charlie, Joubert discovers that Gemma kept a journal, which Charlie has not had the heart to read. Anxious about what the journal may reveal, Joubert steals several of the most recent volumes. Using the journal and personal recollection, Joubert tells the story of Gemma's final few months: Magazine illustrator Gemma Tate has just been dumped by her supercilious lover Patrick Large and is taken in by kindly but impoverished furniture restorer Charlie Bovery, whom she soon marries. Depressed by London life and infuriated by the demands made by Charlie's shrewish ex-wife Judi, Gemma persuades Charlie to sell up and move to Bailleville in Normandy. Gemma's initial delight at her simple new life soon gives way to ennui: their crumbling cottage is smelly and uncomfortable, and Charlie (who settles in Normandy far better) maddens her with his laid-back attitude to everything. Despite doing some piece work for rich, boorish neighbours Mark and Wizzy Rankin, the Boverys are soon considerably in debt. The sensual Gemma has made a considerable impact in Bailleville: The pompous baker Joubert is soon obsessed with her and while following her one night discovers she is having an affair with Herv√© de Bressigny, the son of a local landed family. Enraged with jealousy and disturbed by the uncanny parallels between Gemma's life and that of the heroine of Flaubert's Madame Bovary, Joubert anonymously sends Gemma some photocopied extracts from the book as a warning that she may suffer the same fate as Emma Bovary. Herv√©, terrified of the impact the affair may have on his relationship with his family and girlfriend, soon breaks off the affair. Despite this, Gemma has been energised by the affair and starts to take up the illustrating assignments she had abandoned and is able to start earning good money again. Unfortunately this is not enough to sustain the massive spending spree she undertakes to transform her own appearance and that of the cottage. Charlie, meanwhile, returns to England having found out about Gemma's affair and being appalled by it. Gemma's old lover Patrick turns up in Normandy as a guest of his friends the Rankins - he has been thrown out of his house by his wife Pandora (whom he left Gemma for). Gemma, unable to resist, makes love to him (again witnessed by the furious Joubert) but then realises to her delight that she is now able to resist his charms. She writes to Charlie, asking for his forgiveness, realising he is the steadying influence her life needs. Gemma finds out that it was Joubert who sent her the pages from Madame Bovary and reacts with fury. Mortified with guilt, Joubert sends her a peace offering of freshly baked bread. As she is eating this, she is visited by Patrick, whom she rejects again. However she starts to choke on the bread. Patrick desperately tries the Heimlich maneuver but is disturbed by Charlie, who has just returned from England prompted by Gemma's letter. Charlie misreads the scene and attacks Patrick. As they struggle, Patrick desperately trying to tell Charlie what is really happening, Gemma dies. Furnished with all the facts, Joubert realises his culpability in Gemma's death is small although he is still concerned about Charlie as in Madame Bovary Charles Bovary dies soon after his wife. He is relieved when Charlie reveals his real (never used) name is Cyril. In the epilogue, Joubert observes as a new couple moves into the Boverys' house: an older man and his wife, named Jane Eyre.

It was awarded a Newbery Honor in 2000 and is an ALA Notable Children's Book. The book's target age range is for readers between the ages of 10 to 14. Getting Near to Baby was influenced by the author's personal experience as a child, as her aunt experienced the death of her child due to cystic fibrosis. At the same time a family living nearby had died of a bacterial illness by drinking tainted water. Plot summary In the novel, the characters Willa Jo and Little Sister are dealing with their grief after the passing of their baby sister who drank contaminated water. Their mother is unable to handle her own feelings of dejection while caring for the two girls and sends them to stay with her sister, Patty. Aunt Patty has no children, and her household is full of rules. Aside from moving into a home with their aunt, things become even more difficult for the girls due to the fact that Aunt Patty does not fully understand them. When Willa Jo and Little Sister climb up on Aunt Patty's roof to watch the sunrise, then decide not to come down for a while, Patty realizes she has not been fulfilling the girls' emotional needs. Willa Jo reflects on her time at her Aunt Patty's house, like meeting Liz, the Piggly-Wiggly pickle, and much more.  Characters *Baby: Baby is the youngest child of Noreen. She drank contaminated water at a carnival, was sick through the night, and died in her mother's arms the next morning. *Noreen: Noreen is the mother of Willa Jo, Baby, and Little Sister. After the passing of her youngest daughter, the grief almost seems unbearable. Noreen sends Willa Jo and little sister to Noreen‚Äôs sister Patty‚Äôs house *Willa Jo: Willa Jo is thirteen years old and ends up living with her Aunt Patty after the passing of her baby sister. In the story, Aunt Patty calls Willa Jo by her full name, Willa Jo Dean. *Little Sister: Little Sisters real name is Jo Ann but everyone calls her little sister. Little Sister is seven years old and also goes to live with Aunt Patty after the passing of her baby sister. As a result of Baby's death, she has ceased to speak. *Aunt Patty: Aunt Patty is Noreen's older sister. Throughout the story, Patty comes off as very controlling, having several rules in her household. According to Willa Jo, Aunt Patty is described as a short and wide woman. *Uncle Hob: Uncle Hob is Aunt Patty‚Äôs husband. He is more calm and relaxed than his wife, who tends to come off a bit controlling at times.  Reviews of the book  \\"Couloumbis' first novel wears its heart on one sleeve and its humor on the other. Together, they make a splendid fit.\\" - Booklist, boxed review \\"Willa Jo tells the tale in a nonlinear, back-and- forth fashion that not only prepares readers emotionally for her heartrending account of Baby's death but also artfully illuminates each character's depths and foibles...The author creates a cast founded on likable, real-seeming people who grow and change in response to the tragedy.\\" - Kirkus Reviews, pointer review Theatrical adaptation A theatrical version of Getting Near to Baby was written by Y. York and premiered by People's Light and Theatre Company (Malvern, Pennsylvania) in 2008.

Signs and symptoms Punding, a possible symptom of DDS, is the repetition of complex motor behaviors such as collecting or arranging objects. A slot machine, commonly used for gambling. The most common symptom is craving for dopaminergic medication. However other behavioral symptoms can appear independently of craving or co-occur with it. Craving is an intense impulse of the subject to obtain medication even in the absence of symptoms that indicate its intake. To fulfill this need the person will self-administer extra doses. When self-administration is not possible, aggressive outbursts or the use of strategies such as symptom simulation or bribery to access additional medication can also appear. Hypomania, manifesting with feelings of euphoria, omnipotence, or grandiosity, are prone to appear in those moments when medication effects are maximum; dysphoria, characterized by sadness, psychomotor slowing, fatigue or apathy are typical with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT) withdrawal. Different impulse control disorders have been described including gambling, compulsive shopping, eating disorders and hypersexuality. Behavioral disturbances, most commonly aggressive tendencies, are the norm. Psychosis is also common. Causes Parkinson's disease is a common neurological disorder characterized by a degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and a loss of dopamine in the putamen. It is described as a motor disease, but it also produces cognitive and behavioral symptoms. The most common treatment is dopamine replacement therapy, which consists in the administration of levodopa (L-Dopa) or dopamine agonists (such as pramipexole or ropinirole) to patients. Dopamine replacement therapy is well known to improve motor symptoms but its effects in cognitive and behavioral symptoms are more complex. Dopamine has been related to the normal learning of stimuli with behavioral and motivational significance, attention, and most importantly the reward system. In accordance with the role of dopamine in reward processing, addictive drugs stimulate dopamine release. Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, the role of dopamine in the reward system and addiction has been proposed as the origin of DDS. Models of addiction have been used to explain how dopamine replacement therapy produces DDS. One of these models of addiction proposes that over the usage course of a drug there is a habituation to the rewarding that it produces at the initial stages. This habituation is thought to be dopamine mediated. With long-term administration of L-dopa the reward system gets used to it and needs higher quantities. As the user increases drug intake there is a loss of dopaminergic receptors in the striatum which acts in addition to an impairment in goal-direction mental functions to produce an enhancement of sensitization to dopamine therapy. The behavioral and mood symptoms of the syndrome are produced by the dopamine overdose. Diagnosis Diagnosis of the syndrome is clinical since there are no laboratory tests to confirm it. For diagnosis a person with documented responsiveness to medication has to increase medication intake beyond dosage needed to relieve their parkinsonian symptoms in a pathological addiction-like pattern. A current mood disorder (depression, anxiety, hypomanic state or euphoria), behavioral disorder (excessive gambling, shopping or sexual tendency, aggression, or social isolation) or an altered perception about the effect of medication also have to be present. A questionnaire on the typical symptoms of DDS has also been developed and can help in the diagnosis process. Prevention The main prevention measure proposed is the prescription of the lowest possible dose of dopamine replacement therapy to individuals at risk. The minimization of the use of dopamine agonists, and of short duration formulations of L-Dopa can also decrease risk of the syndrome. Management First choice management measure consists in the enforcement of a dopaminergic drug dosage reduction. If this decrease is maintained, dysregulation syndrome features soon decrease. Cessation of dopamine agonists therapy may also be of use. Some behavioral characteristics may respond to psychotherapy; and social support is important to control risk factors. In some cases antipsychotic drugs may also be of use in the presence of psychosis, aggression, gambling or hypersexuality. Based upon five case reports, valproic acid may have efficacy in controlling the symptoms of levodopa-induced DDS that arise from the use of levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Epidemiology DDS is not common among PD patients. Prevalence may be around 4%. Its prevalence is higher among males with an early onset of the disease. Previous substance abuse such as heavy drinking or drug intake seems to be the main risk factor along with a history of affective disorder. History PD was first formally described in 1817; however, L-dopa did not enter clinical practice until almost 1970. In these initial works there were already reports of neuropsychiatric complications. During the following decades cases featuring DDS symptoms in relation to dopamine therapy such as hypersexuality, gambling or punding, appeared. DDS was first described as a syndrome in the year 2000. Three years later the first review articles on the syndrome were written, showing an increasing awareness of the DDS importance. Diagnostic criteria were proposed in 2005.

Her best results with Romania were a fourth place in the 1989 World Championship and a fifth place on the World event three years earlier. Following the cessation of her club, the left back moved to Hungary in January 1992, having signed by Debrecen. From 1993 to 1997 M√°t√©fi played for Gy≈ëri ETO KC. In 1995 she obtained the Hungarian citizenship thus became eligible to get picked for the Hungarian national team, and M√°t√©fi won the silver medal right on her first major tournament, the 1995 World Championship. A year later on the Olympic Games in Atlanta she collected the bronze medal. M√°t√©fi spent her the final years of her active career by Dunaferr, with them she achieved her biggest successes on club level: beside the domestic double in 1998 and 1999 she first won the EHF Cup title (1998), then triumphed in the EHF Champions Leaguge (1999). M√°t√©fi received her coaching diploma yet in 1998 and after retiring from professional handball in 1999 she began to train the youth sides of Dunaferr. Later she was promoted to assistant coach and also had spells by the Hungarian national team in younger age categories. She got her first head coaching job in 2007 from B√©k√©scsabai El≈ëre NKSE.

Founder of the Empire Club, a powerful political organization in New York during the mid-19th century, his \\"sluggers\\" committed voter intimidation and election fraud on behalf of Tammany Hall throughout the 1840s and 1850s before Tammany became an exclusively Irish-dominated institution. He held considerable influence in Tammany Hall for twenty-five years and was credited for delivering New York to James K. Polk and securing his election as President of the United States. He was similarly successful in the presidential elections of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, the latter appointing him U.S. Marshal of the Southern District of New York. Although Rynders Street (now part of Centre Street) is sometimes said to have been named in his honor,Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld.

Albany, N.Y, 1921. (pg. 256) Although nominally loyal to Tammany for the majority of his career, his Empire Cub heading the fight against the nativist Know Nothing movement for over a decade, Rynders aligned himself with the Know Nothings for a brief period during the 1850s. This eventually brought him into conflict with his former prot√©g√© John Morrissey who would eventually replace him as political boss of the Sixth Ward.Asbury, Herbert.

(pg. 26-28) Rynders first appeared in New York City during the mid-1830s, after a brief career as a professional gambler and pistol-and-knife fighter on the Mississippi River, and soon became involved in local politics. An enthusiastic supporter of Tammany Hall, he established himself as one of the most politically skilled organizers in the city. He was said to have \\"sometimes permitted his love of the Irish and hatred for the English to upset his judgment\\", however he also recognized the value of using the numerous street gangs for Tammany Hall. Owner of at least half a dozen green-groceries in Paradise Square, he was able to win the predominantly Irish-American gangs to the cause of Tammany Hall and organize them into a voting block. He later established a network of saloons and gambling parlors which supported his political club and generated revenue for Tammany Hall. He originally operated from Sweeney's House of Refreshment, an Ann Street tavern popular with volunteer firefighters, before founding the Empire Club in 1843.Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pp. 312-13) The Park Row clubhouse quickly became the political hub of the Sixth Ward and, through a heavy campaign of voter intimidation and election fraud, he was credited for securing the presidency of Democratic candidate James K. Polk during the United States presidential election of 1844. It was also the headquarters from which he directed his lieutenants such as Country McCleester, Edward Z.C. Judson, Paudeen McLaughlin, Jim Turner, Lew Baker and John Morrissey and the Dead Rabbits against the Know Nothings and their Bowery supporters which included the Atlantic Guards and the Bowery Boys. Rynders was alleged to have been involved in instigating the Astor Place Riot in 1849 Walling, George W.. Recollections of a New York Chief of Police. New York: Caxton Book Concern, 1887. (pg. 47) and later made trips to Philadelphia, Baltimore and New Orleans where he advised local Democratic leaders on Tammany-style machine politics. By the end of the decade, he was considered to be the de facto leader of the Five Points street gangs and was often requested by authorities to use his influence to cease rioting and gang-related violence which the police were unable to stop. He was a particularly important figure in civil disturbances against abolitionists during the period encountering such people as Frederick Douglass and Abby Gibbons.Bacon, Margaret Hope. Abby Hopper Gibbons: Prison Reformer and Social Activist. Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000. (pg. 64); On one occasion, Wendell Phillips was stopped from speaking at the Broadway Tabernacle when Rynders publicly threatened that he and his men would \\"wreck the building and mob the audience\\". Henry Ward Beecher invited Phillips to speak at Plymouth Church and, when a mob led by Rynders followed Phillips, he and his followers were met by a group of well-armed men who defended the building. It was during this meeting that Phillips not only spoke out against slavery but also of the corruption of Tammany Hall. Rynders was involved in the successful presidential elections of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, during the presidential elections of 1852 and 1856 respectively, and was appointed by Buchanan as U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York in 1857.Blake, E. Vale. History of the Tammany Society or Columbian Order From its Organization to the Present Time. New York: Souvenir Publishing Company, 1901. (pg. 68) On June 9, 1854, Rynders married 20-year- old Phoebe Shotwell, the last surviving child of real estate mogul John Shotwell and Phoebe Byron, in Washington, DC.Shotwell, Ambrose M. Annals of Our Colonial Ancestors and Their Descendants, Or, Our Quaker Forefathers and Their Posterity. Lansing, Michigan: Robert Smith & Co., 1895. (pp. 145, 151) For a brief time during this period, he renamed his political organization the Americus Club and switched his allegiances to the Know Nothings causing a deep rift between him and his Irish supporters, most notably his prot√©g√© John Morrissey. This decision would lead to his downfall as the political boss of the Sixth Ward when, during the Dead Rabbits Riot in 1857, he was attacked and pelted with rocks while attempting to persuade the warring gangsters to cease fighting. His reputation suffered considerably after this point and Morrissey eventually replaced Rynders as head of the Sixth Ward.Asbury, Herbert.

(pg. 213-214, 295) In early 1861, he was ordered by Chairman Morris to find William Hepburn Russell and return him to Washington, D.C. but telegraphed the capitol on March 2 that he was unable to locate him. Rynders reported that he had heard rumors that Russell was residing in Philadelphia but that he did not believe the report.Raymond W. and Mary Lund Settle. Empire on Wheels. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1949. (pg. 112) He was among several Tammany political leaders who opposed the American Civil War, going so far as to support Mayor Fernando Wood's proposal to take New York City out of the Union, and later fought the federal government over conscription prior to the New York Draft Riots in 1863.Bernstein, Iver.

(pg. 49) While also acting in his capacity as a U.S. marshal, he was responsible for the attempted capture of fellow Tammany operative Isaac Vanderbeck Fowler. Upon entry to the hotel where Fowler was staying, Rynders made such a ruckus that Fowler was able to escape and eventually landed in Mexico. Rynders was portrayed in the historical novel The Furies (1976) by John Jakes and Lucrecia Mott (1999) by Dorothy Sterling. ReferencesFurther reading *Asbury, Herbert.

One of the most notorious criminals in New York City, he was involved in several major robberies in the post-American Civil War era. Among his exploits included the daylight robbery of the Royal Insurance Company in 1866 and was an alleged participant in the theft of $1,000,000 from industrialist Rufus L. Lord arraigned by George Leonidas Leslie in 1876.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 313) Moss, Frank.

(pg. 249-266) BiographyEarly life and criminal career= Dan Noble was born in England and immigrated to the United States in 1857, when not yet properly into his teens. His parents followed shortly after and his father opened a porterhouse on the corner of Twenty-Fourth Street and Ninth Avenue. It soon became a popular spot for thieves, burglars and other underworld figures, where Noble became closely associated with the \\"Long Doctor\\", \\"Big\\" Jack Connolly and Johnny Murphy under whose tutelage he was encouraged to enter the trade himself. In his first attempt at burglary however, he was caught trying to rob a house on East Twenty-Third Street, and had in his possession nippers, a jimmy and a skeleton key. Although these were the tools used by an experienced thief, it was later found that the 15-year- old Noble had borrowed the tools from an elderly thief who was boarding with his father. Because of his youth and lack of a criminal record, as well as some outside influence, the charges against him were dropped.Farley, Philip. Criminals of America, Or, Tales of the Lives of Thieves: Enabling Every One to be His Own Detective, With Portraits, Making a Complete Rogues' Gallery. New York: Author's Edition, 1876. (pg. 486-487) Noble continued to be involved in burglary, but eventually became a butcher as he reached adulthood. Although he was successful in this trade, he was drawn back into crime after becoming acquainted with a group of \\"till-tappers\\", Jimmy Price and brothers Fred, Scott and George Newton, whom he later joined. After a time learning under them, he returned to burglary and also pickpocketing. He felt more comfortable as a pickpocket apparently believing the activity to require less skill and provided lower risk for arrest. He typically targeted young women, as well as men on occasion. \\"He considered it required less skill, less adroitness, and less nerve to slip his fingers into a woman's pocket, and secure the contents, than to jump into a basement and scurry off with whatever he could catch.\\". Despite his success, he was arrested twice in a two-year period while in the pocket picking line. He was released on these two occasions but was sentenced to six months at Blackwell's Island. Shortly after his release, he became partners with Hettie Thompson, sister of the infamous Maria Thompson, and they traveled together throughout the country. He later headed a group of sneak thieves including Jimmy Griffin, Frank Knapp and Jack Tierney, whose activities he planned and financed. Though primarily based in New York City, they were also active in other major cities across the country. One of the most celebrated thieves in the city at this time, he was once invited to an underworld gathering hosted by saloonkeeper Mush Riley. It was at this banquet that the guest were treated to a mystery main course which Riley later revealed to be a Newfoundland dog. He operated with a great deal of cooperation from the New York Police Department, reportedly having as many as 30 police officers on his payroll, until his eventual arrest.Moss, Frank. The American Metropolis from Knickerbocker Days to the Present Time. London: The Authors' Syndicate, 1897. (pg. 25, 26) =Encounter with Allen Pinkerton= Noble ran a faro house on Broadway during the American Civil War, as well a faro bank with Charles Brockway. It was during this time that he fell prey to a practical joke by Allen Pinkerton, famed detective and founder of the Pinkerton Detective Agency.Pinkerton, Allen. Thirty Years a Detective: A Thorough and Comprehensive Expos√© on Criminal Practices of All Grades and Classes. New York: G.W. Dillingham, 1884. (pg. 393) Pinkerton, then head of the US Secret Service, was originally in New York visiting Colonel Thomas Key. On the day of his arrival, he checked into the St. Nicholas late in the afternoon and planned to meet with Key at the Fifth Avenue Hotel later that evening. He intended to return to Washington, DC that same night or early the next morning however, while wandering around the rotunda and public rooms of the hotel Pinkerton was approached by two men. Instantly recognizing the two as confidence men, their old con games well known to the veteran detective, Pinkerton played along allowing the men to lure him to Noble's faro house nearby. He convinced the men that he was an army contractor, in town to buy a thousand cavalry horses, and implied that he was carrying a considerable sum. Upon gaining entry into the gambling resort, and armed with a pistol concealed in his pocket, he bided his time as the two \\"steerers\\" as well as other gamblers encouraged him to play. He eventually announced that was leaving, claiming that he did not understand the games, to which the dealers protested including Noble. Inviting the confidence man to have a drink with him at the bar, causing some surprise and confusion among the patrons. Noble hesitantly agreed; however, he soon became suspicious demanding to know his identity. Pinkerton obliged Noble by identifying he and others in the room as gamblers, swindlers and other criminals. When Noble then asked if Pinkerton was after him or anyone else, Pinkerton replied he had not and casually dismissed himself to the astonishment of the crowd. =Robbery of the Royal Insurance Company= On December 10, 1866, the Broadway office of the Liverpool and London-based Royal Insurance Company was robbed of over a quarter of a million dollars in bonds. The day of the robbery, a meeting of the American company directors was to take place at noon. At half-past 10:00 am, a tin box containing $25,000 in government bonds and negotiable securities was brought to the firm's office from the Merchants' Bank. Although deposited and kept in its vaults for safekeeping, it was customary at these meetings for the board of directors to use or inspect the box for any change in stock. The box was placed in the vault opening from the back room of the office of company agent Anthony B. McDonald. The inner iron door of the safe was closed but not locked. At around 11:20 am, two well-dressed men respectable looking men entered the building expressing an interest in life insurance and were shown into McDonnell's office. One of the men, described as \\"a young man about 30 years of age and having the appearance of an able commercial traveler on a fine salary\\", took a seat on the opposite side of the table of McDonald and immediately began speaking to him about terms of life insurance policies. He then explained that he and several others were preparing to go down the Mississippi River to New Orleans on business for their respective companies and were interested in obtaining life insurance during their extended trip to the South. The young man continued further by stating that he and his group were as yet undecided whether they should take a \\"traveler's risk\\" or purchase insurance. He himself was in favor of getting life insurance as he claimed to be a married man. His companion also commented occasionally and supported his claim that the young man had been appointed the group's spokesman and would negotiate the terms of the policies. While the young man and the agent continued speaking, the second man excused himself and left the room for a few moments. The vault was situated to one side and to the rear of McDonald's office. The agent was, at this time, engrossed in tables and statements which he displayed for the young man and from which he calculated from a table of risks so as to satisfy the inquiries of his potential client. Meanwhile, the second man spent a few moments and walked the halls examining various portraits and other ornaments hanging on the walls. He returned to the office where he casually informed his friend that he would have to leave or would miss an important appointment. Agreeing to meet him later during the day, the second man wished the men a good day and left the office. A few minutes later, the young man concluded his business with the agent, thanking him for his kindness and attention, and promised to call him after consulting his friends. The meeting was held as scheduled and at the time the directors were to examine the box, it was found to be missing. An alarm was quickly raised and police quickly deduced that the two gentlemen served to distract McDonald while sneak thieves infiltrated the office and stole the tin box. These men were under the employ of Noble who somehow found out about the meeting and was believed to have planned the operation. He and Jack Tierney waited outside in a horse-drawn carriage, either to take off with the box or to provide the thieves to escape if they were caught, while the two salesmen Frank Knapp and Jimmy Griffin posed as the salesmen who spoke to McDonald. Knapp stayed in the office with McDonald, purposely taking a seat in which McDonald's back was to the vault, while Griffin excused himself then slipped back into the office where he took the box from the vault. He returned to the office, with the box hidden under his overcoat, and said he had to go out for a few minutes. Griffin met Noble and Tierney outside to delivering the box then returned to the office where he made his excuses and left the building with Knapp following soon after. =Later years= Noble and his partners went into hiding immediately following the robbery. Knapp and Griffin fled to Canada on the advice of Noble; however, there was a falling out between the men when their shares amounted to $27,000 each. This was a meager sum considering the heist netted over a quarter of a million dollars. The argument between Noble and his partners eventually led to his arrest, conviction and brief imprisonment. The insurance company eventually recovered $55,000 bonds, on payment of a premium or reward of 15%. Noble eluded authorities for over four years until his arrest and conviction in Oswego, New York in February 1871. His wealth, by this time, had all been used up during his time on the run and his trial. Noble was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at Sing Sing but escaped after serving less than a year. According to an alternate version by George W. Walling, former police chief of the New York Police Department, Noble was sentenced to five years imprisonment for a burglary in Elmira, New York when he became acquainted with Jimmy Hope and James Brady while in Auburn State Prison and eventually escaped with them. He fled to England soon after where he was largely associated with \\"sporting swells\\". He visited France for a brief time, on the Paris Bourse in 1873, he was caught attempting to rob a broker's office and sentenced to five years penal servitude. Released after serving his sentence, he was liberated in time to attend the Paris Exposition in the summer of 1878. He eventually moved back to England where he was eventually convicted for forgery, arrested after attempting to use bank notes printed by forger George Engles at a London bank, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.Bidwell, George. Forging His Own Chains: The Wonderful Life-Story of George Bidwell. Hartford, Connecticut: Bidwell Publishing Company, 1891. (pg. 597) He served roughly half of his term, his health failing in his old age, and died in prison.

It was built using materials from Goriƒçane Castle, which stood just above the site and of which only a few foundation stones are visible. Goriƒçane Castle was owned by the Ljubljana Diocese and, when it fell into ruin, Bishop Oton Buckheim (1606‚Äì1664) made the decision to build the manor. Construction took place from 1641 to 1644 In 1934 the manor was the site of a regional conference of the Communist Party of Slovenia, which Josip Broz Tito took part in under the pseudonym Rudi. The manor remained the property of the Ljubljana Diocese until the end of the Second World War, when it was nationalized. It was initially used as residential apartments, but renovation began in 1962 to use the structure for museum purposes. In 1964 the Museum of Non-European Cultures (a branch of the Slovene Ethnographic Museum) was set up in the building. After Slovenia's independence in 1991, the Ljubljana Archdiocese launched a denationalization suit to have the property returned to it. This was initially denied in 1995. The mansion was used as a museum and exhibition venue until 2001, but it and its surrounding estate were returned by the government to the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. The manor is currently managed by the Parish of Preska. The manor has been undergoing restoration since 2004 and is currently closed to the public.Goriƒçane on the Medvode municipal site Gallery File:Goricane Slovenia - wayside shrine.JPGWayside shrine in Goriƒçane ReferencesExternal links * *Goriƒçane on Geopedia Category:Populated places in the Municipality of Medvode ","title":"Goriƒçane"},{"id":"20807057","text":"Teji Harivansh Rai Srivastava Bachchan (n√©e Tejwant Kaur Suri) (12 August 1914 ‚Äì 21 December 2007) was an Indian social activist, the wife of Hindi poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and mother of Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.

Biography Elbin started out as a caddie at the Cumberland Country Club in Cumberland, Maryland, where he developed his golfing skills and won the club's Caddie Championship as a teenager. While at the practice green preparing to compete in the 1939 Bedford Springs Open at the Bedford Springs Hotel, he met Lew Worsham, the pro at the Burning Tree Club in Bethesda, Maryland. Worsham hired Elbin in 1940 as his assistant at Burning Tree for $19 per week. During the winter, Elbin worked at the Indian Creek Club in Miami Beach, Florida for $25 per week. During World War II, Elbin joined the United States Army Air Corps in 1942, serving as crew chief on a B-29 Superfortress that saw action over New Guinea, the Philippines and Tokyo.

The suburb is located in Wollongong's southern suburbs, on the northern shore of Lake Illawarra, and is one of the city's most populous suburbs. At the , it had a population of 7,605.  History  Historically a farming community situated between the hills and Lake Illawarra, Berkeley became one of the Illawarra's solutions to a public housing shortage in the early years. Subsequently, several public housing developments were established and most of these are still in existence today in certain parts of the suburb. To date approximately close to one in four dwellings consist of public housing owned by Housing NSW. The suburb has however enjoyed significant growth in the last two decades, with younger working families moving into the district in search of new homes. Berkeley's distance from Wollongong and vast space at the time identified it as an attractive option to new families and today much of the farmland is occupied by housing estates marketed as Regency Heights. The Berkeley of today houses a rich mix of Wollongong's community, different from that typically associated with the area in the 1980s.  Overview  The suburb is home to a small shopping precinct that contains a supermarket, petrol station, pub, post office, community swimming pool and The Berkeley Life Centre Church located in Kelly street. A Community Centre provides a meeting place for local residents. By the lake there are stretches of parkland and several jetties which provide locals with lakeside recreation options. The Easts Group owns and operates the local Berkeley Sports and Social Club located just outside the shopping precinct. Fred Finch Park is home to baseball fields and both indoor and outdoor basketball courts, acting as a hub for sports in the local area. Several of the early streets in Berkeley are named after the original farm owners of the district. There are currently two primary schools in the area, the Berkeley Public School and Berkeley West Public School. Berkeley South Public School was closed at the end of the 2009 school year due to low attendance and students were reassigned between the other two primary schools. Berkeley is also home to a public high school, the Illawarra Sports High School. Originally known as Berkeley High School, the school changed its name in 1998 in line with becoming a sports-oriented school. Public transport is provided by Premier Illawarra, a bus company contracted by the New South Wales Ministry of Transport to provide services to most of the Illawarra region. Due to a history of drug abuse problems in Berkeley and the surrounding suburbs, the area houses several specialist drug and alcohol treatment centres, which includes the Wollongong Crisis Centre and Kedesh House. The Lake Illawarra Local Area Command provides police response to the suburb with NSW Ambulance Service providing response from its Warrawong Station. The church offers many programs such as the Alpha course and celebrate recovery for people with addictions.

Symptoms are typically vague. They may include vomiting, loss of appetite, confusion, blurred vision, changes in color perception, and decreased energy. Potential complications include an irregular heartbeat, which can be either too fast or too slow. Toxicity may occur over a short period of time following an overdose or gradually during long-term treatment. Risk factors include low potassium, low magnesium, and high calcium. Digoxin is a medication used for heart failure or atrial fibrillation. An electrocardiogram is a routine part of diagnosis. Blood levels are only useful more than six hours following the last dose. Activated charcoal may be used if it can be given within two hours of the person taking the medication. Atropine may be used if the heart rate is slow while magnesium sulfate may be used in those with premature ventricular contractions. Treatment of severe toxicity is with digoxin-specific antibody fragments. Its use is recommended in those who have a serious dysrhythmia, are in cardiac arrest, or have a potassium of greater than 5 mmol/L. Low blood potassium or magnesium should also be corrected. Toxicity may reoccur within a few days after treatment. In Australia in 2012 there were about 140 documented cases. This is a decrease by half since 1994 as a result of decreased usage of digoxin. In the United States 2500 cases were reported in 2011 which resulted in 27 deaths. The condition was first described in 1785 by William Withering. Signs and symptoms Digoxin toxicity is often divided into acute or chronic toxicity. In both of these toxicity, cardiac effects are of the greatest concern. With an acute ingestion, symptoms such as nausea, vertigo, and vomiting are prominent. On the other hand, nonspecific symptoms are predominant in chronic toxicity. These symptoms include fatigue, malaise, and visual disturbances. The classic features of digoxin toxicity are nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, confusion, delirium, vision disturbance (blurred or yellow vision). It is also associated with cardiac disturbances including irregular heartbeat, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, sinoatrial block and AV block. Diagnosis In individuals with suspected digoxin toxicity, a serum digoxin concentration, serum potassium concentration, creatinine, BUN, and serial electrocardiograms is obtained. =ECG= An ECG showing digoxin toxicity with the classic \\"scooped out\\" ST segment In digoxin toxicity, the finding of frequent premature ventricular beats (PVCs) is the most common and the earliest dysrhythmia. Sinus bradycardia is also very common. In addition, depressed conduction is a predominant feature of digoxin toxicity. Other ECG changes that suggest digoxin toxicity include bigeminal and trigeminal rhythms, ventricular bigeminy, and bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. =Blood test= The level of digoxin for treatment is typically 0.5-2 ng/mL. Since this is a narrow therapeutic index, digoxin overdose can happen. A serum digoxin concentration of 0.5-0.9 ng/mL among those with heart failure is associated with reduced heart failure deaths and hospitalizations. It is therefore recommended that digoxin concentration be maintained in approximately this range if it is used in heart failure patients. High amounts of the electrolyte potassium (K+) in the blood (hyperkalemia) is characteristic of digoxin toxicity. Digoxin toxicity increases in individuals who have kidney impairment. This is most often seen in elderly or those with chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease. Treatment Digoxin immune Fab used to treat digoxin toxicity The primary treatment of digoxin toxicity is digoxin immune fab, which is an antibody made up of anti-digoxin immunoglobulin fragments. This antidote has been shown to be highly effective in treating life-threatening signs of digoxin toxicity such as hyperkalemia, hemodynamic instability, and arrhythmias. Fab dose can be determined by two different methods. First method is based on the amount of digoxin ingested whereas the second method is based on the serum digoxin concentration and the weight of the person. Other treatment that may be used to treat life- threatening arrhythmias until Fab is acquired are magnesium, phenytoin, and lidocaine.

Retrieved: December 22, 2008. Originally released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication.Pierce, David. \\"Forgotten faces: Why some of our cinema heritage is part of the public domain.\\" Film History: An International Journal, Volume 19, Issue 2, June 2007, pp. 125‚Äì143. ISSN 0892-2160. Described as a \\"lighthearted and lightweight story\\" by Turner Classic Movies, Three Guys Named Mike chronicles the story of an airline stewardess (the term at that time) and her three suitors. Plot Marcy Lewis is a young woman from Indiana with an ambition to become an airline stewardess and see the world. She takes an American Airlines training course and passes. Her first flight is nearly her last when, after inadvertently offending the pilot, Mike Jamison, she forgets the passengers' food. Mike's intervention earns Marcy a second chance. Marcy's home base is moved to Los Angeles and she finds an apartment with one friend from stewardess school. She meets a passenger, Mike Lawrence, who is a graduate research student in science, then also nearly loses her job again by permitting a young passenger to keep her dog in the cabin, against the airline's rules. Marcy is suspended for a week. When a man named Mike Tracy helps give her stalled car a push, Marcy learns that he works for a Chicago advertising agency. An idea of hers, to let stewardesses endorse soap, pleases Tracy's client, and soon Marcy is invited by a photographer to pose for magazine ads herself. When all three show up to help Marcy move into her new bungalow she is now sharing with three of her friends from stewardess training, she tries to keep the Mikes straight. Marcy names her male companions, Mike for Mike Tracey, Mikey for Mike Lawrence and Michael for Mike Jamison. All of them are jealous of each other and vie for Marcy's attention. During a party later at her bungalow, Marcy is called away when her photographer requests one more picture to send out with the rest of the ad campaign for approval. Marcy finds herself dressed in a very short sarong, totally unlike the regulation company uniform in which all the other pictures were taken. The photographer also is only interested in fixing her a drink and having her relax on the cushion placed on the floor which is part of the props. She objects strenuously, but he is not hearing her. The three Mikes arrive in time to start a brawl, which makes the newspapers and gets both Marcy and her pilot friend suspended from their jobs, as well as costing Mikey his account. Mike's job as a graduate research student and consideration for a special fellowship award for an outstanding scientist, is in jeopardy. The award would get him a teaching position at the college, and allow him to continue his research there as well. Marcy goes to the superiors of all three men personally to plead for their reinstatement. After she is successful, all three Mikes propose marriage to her. Not positive what to do, Marcy reacts favorably to Mike Lawrence's \\"I love you,\\" and the other two Mikes concede that he is the guy for her.

Contemporary publicity states that Wells was a flight attendant for American Airlines; she appeared in a bit part in one scene, playing herself. She is also credited as \\"Technical Advisor.\\" Since Jane Wyman was a major star at that time, her co-stars were equally notable, with Van Johnson being one of MGM's leading actors and Keel having recently achieved stardom in Annie Get Your Gun.Morella and Epstein 1985, p. 157. American Airlines provided advertising in the film and allowed the producers of the film to use American Airlines aircraft for no charge; during that time aircraft were considered to be expensive props in films. Some early scenes in the film portrayed the training given at the American Airlines school for flight attendants. Sidney Sheldon wrote the screenplay. American Airlines Douglas DC-6 and Convair 240 airliners were featured in Three Guys Named Mike.Santoir, Christian. \\"Vebnus in Uniform: Three Guys Named Mike.\\" Aeromovies.

Reviewer Bosley Crowther of The New York Times criticized Three Guys Named Mike, stating that \\"for services rendered in the advertising line, that company should award her a gold star (its advertising is all over the film), but if she's still hostessing, it should keep an eye on her. We suspect she spends too much time reading those leather-bound slick magazines rather than attending to the business of serving her real-life passengers\\" in relation to the glamorized portrayal of airline travel.

The piece has established itself as a core member of the piano trio repertoire. It is also the only work by Chopin that features the violin (excluding orchestral parts).

This is a perennial herb producing an unbranching stem around 10 centimeters tall. There is generally one basal leaf about 20 centimeters long which persists in flowering, and one smaller leaf higher up on the stem. The inflorescence is a pair of erect, bell-shaped flowers with pinkish-purple sepals and petals 3.5 to 4 centimeter in length. The petals have bright yellow hairs near the bases. The fruit is a winged capsule about a centimeter long. Threats to this rare species include invasive species, wildfire suppression, and construction and maintenance of roads and radio towers. The non-native noxious weed dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria) directly competes with the mariposa lily by monopolizing water and nutrients and producing allelopathic substances which inhibit its germination. Fire suppression efforts at the California sites have resulted in overgrowth of native trees and shrubs such as Oregon-grape (Mahonia aquifolium) and curl-leaf mountain mahogany (Cercocarpus ledifolius), which shade out small wildflowers such as mariposa lilies.

History  As part of the procurement of 2-4-0 locomotives in the early 1870s, a total of eight batches of Class IV c engines were ordered. These locomotives were used above all on lines with steep inclines in the Black Forest and the Odenwald. As a result, several engines were equipped with a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake.  Design features  Then dimensions of these engines were largely the same as those of the Class IV b. However the double frame was dropped and replaced by a simple plate frame. The engine had a very short wheelbase and as a result good curve-running performance. In addition the carrying axle had a side play of 10 mm. It was returned to its centre position by sloping bearing surfaces (geneigte Doppelfl√§chen). The grate area of the firebox turned out to be very small; as a result its steam generation was not particularly satisfactory. Trials with ribbed tubes did not produce any improvements. The large steam dome sat on the rear boiler section. The outside wet-steam engine had inside valves and drove the first coupled axle. The wheels were sprung with leaf springs located over the top, that were linked by a compensating lever between the coupled wheels.

The trust comprises Warrington Hospital, Halton General Hospital in Runcorn and Houghton Hall in Warrington and is responsible for a budget of around ¬£200 million per annum. 4,100 staff work across the hospitals and provide access to care for a population of over 500,000 people. In 2019 it began discussions of a merger with Bridgewater Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. My choice The trust introduced what they called the My Choice system in 2013, which enabled people to pay themselves for procedures the NHS would not provide for patients who had been denied varicose vein procedures. This is not described as a private patients service. According to the trust: \\"All procedures are carried out as part of the Trust‚Äôs normal elective programme.\\" In 2019 it was expanded. The price list includes ¬£8,500 for revision of knee replacement surgery, ¬£7,000 for a hip replacement or hip resurfacing, and ¬£2,000 for circumcision. Information technology Warrington Hospital has what is said to be the oldest fax machine in the NHS, purchased by the trust in 1998. The trust says use of HealthRoster software has permitted them to reduce the use of bank and agency staff. Lorenzo patient record systems are being introduced to the Trust during 2015.  Houghton Hall  Opened in December 2008 this 39-bed facility in the Orford area of Warrington was run by the hospital trust and offered therapy and rehabilitation for people who no longer require medical care in an acute hospital bed but need some further support before returning home. Houghton Hall closed in March 2011 with services provided in other settings in the town. Performance Four-hour target in the emergency department quarterly figures from NHS England Data from https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting- times-and-activity/ The trust was one of 26 responsible for half of the national growth in patients waiting more than four hours in accident and emergency over the 2014/15 winter. In June 2019 it was advertising that patients could pay privately for operations on the NHS treatments blacklist which the NHS would not pay for, but withdrew the advertisement after widespread criticism.

The facilities collect wastewater samples, conduct chemical and/or biological tests of the samples, and submit reports to a state agency or the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). All point source dischargers to ‚ÄùWaters of the U.S.‚Äù must obtain a National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from the appropriate agency, and many permittees are required to file DMRs.Note: Some permittees, notably stormwater dischargers (e.g., construction site operators and municipal separate storm sewer systems), may not be required to file DMRs. These facilities prepare stormwater pollution prevention plans and may be required to submit other reports, which vary from state to state. See EPA, \\"Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plans for Construction Activities.\\" (Accessed 2016-03-17.) NPDES permits and DMR reporting process For permits other than stormwater permits, the agencies issue effluent limitations for specific pollutants, pursuant to the Clean Water Act (CWA). The basis for these limitations depends on the type of discharging facility, the discharge characteristics and status of the specific surface water body receiving the discharge. * National technology-based standards apply to many industries (these standards are called \\"effluent guidelines\\"), and to municipal sewage treatment plants.EPA. \\"Secondary Treatment Regulation.\\" Code of Federal Regulations, . * Some dischargers are subject to water quality-based effluent limitations, derived from water quality standards for the adjacent water body. * For pollutants not covered by the above circumstances, the agency may set technology-based limitations based on its \\"best professional judgment\\" (BPJ). Most NPDES permits require facilities to submit monthly DMRs, but some permits require seasonal or semi- annual reporting. Facilities may collect and analyze samples more frequently, e.g. weekly, and summarize the results for the prescribed reporting period. Permits typically require reporting of wastewater flow and the results of one or more chemical tests corresponding to the effluent limitations. Typical monitoring parameters include pH, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (nitrates and phosphorus), various toxic pollutants, temperature, etc. Some permits also require aquatic biomonitoring of the receiving waterbody.  Accessing DMR Data  The CWA defines DMR data as publicly available information (except for data that would reveal trade secrets).United States. Clean Water Act, section 308(b), . EPA houses DMR data in its Integrated Compliance Information System (ICIS). The NPDES e-reporting Tool Discharge Monitoring Report (NetDMR) is an EPA web-based tool that allows NPDES permittees to electronically sign and submit their discharge monitoring reports to EPA via a secure internet connection (NetDMR is the new tool that replaced the previous Permit Compliance System (PCS)). Information from ICIS database is available through EPA's \\"Envirofacts\\" website and \\"Enforcement and Compliance History Online\\" (ECHO). The Agency provides a DMR \\"Pollutant Loading Tool\\" to help users determine who is discharging, what pollutants they are discharging and how much, and where they are discharging. EPA also allows users to search its Facility Registry System, to compare a facility's compliance with air, water and solid waste permits and regulations.

Early life Kaufmann was born in Manhattan on November 10, 1918, to Charles and Antoinette Kaufmann. His father died when Kaufmann was 10 years old. He attended The Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut, where his classmates included John F. Kennedy. He attended Yale University, earning a bachelor's degree in international studies in 1939. Career Kaufmann served in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. After the war, he returned to Yale and earned a master's degree in 1947 and a doctorate in 1948, both in international studies.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"William Kaufmann, Nuclear Strategist Who Helped Reshape Policy, Dies at 90 \\", The New York Times, December 21, 2008. Accessed December 22, 2008. He was on the faculty at the Yale Institute of International Studies until 1951, when he was part of a group that left and founded Princeton University's Center of International Studies. While at Princeton in the mid-1950s, he wrote \\"Limited War\\", a, paper that argued for expansion of the conventional armies of Western Europe, instead of a reliance on nuclear weapons, to forestall an invasion by the Soviet Union. In 1956, he was hired by the RAND Corporation. He became a member of the political science faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961 and also took a position that same year with the United States Department of Defense, splitting his time between both for several years. The vision of counterforce, developed by Kaufmann and others, was that the response to an invasion of Western Europe by the Soviet Union should be a measured sequence of responses, which would start with targeted attacks of military assets that could escalate to attacks on cities if hostilities were not suspended. The hope was that an all-out nuclear war could be avoided. The counterforce proposal stood in contrast to the massive retaliation approach advocated by United States Air Force General Curtis LeMay at Strategic Air Command in which the US response to a Soviet invasion, even one without nuclear attacks, would be nuclear weapons on all major military and civilian sites in the Soviet Union and its allies, which could have resulted in hundreds of millions of deaths. Kaufmann was hired by United States Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara after President John F. Kennedy took office, as one of McNamara's Whiz Kids. McNamara included parts of Kaufmann's counterforce proposals into the nuclear strategy that he was developing. A 1986 article in Foreign Affairs called Kaufmann \\"the man who may well be the most knowledgeable individual in this country on the defense budgets of the past quarter-century.\\"Bernstein, Adam. \\"Defense Expert William Kaufmann\\", The Washington Post, December 17, 2008. Accessed December 22, 2008. In a report written with John D. Steinbruner in 1991 for the Brookings Institution, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Kaufman opined that the US could meet its post-Cold War defense obligations after cutting military spending by a third. The report noted that \\"the future ability of the United States to maintain the conditions of its security will depend as much on its moral authority, diplomatic skills and economic assets as on its military capabilities.\\" Kaufmann died at 90 years of age on December 14, 2008, in Woburn, Massachusetts, of complications from Alzheimer's disease.

It was located in Niinisalo from 1977 to 1997. In 1997 it was relocated to H√§meenlinna. History The exhibition building of the museum A museum dedicated to the field artillery was discussed in Finland already in the 1930s but the war years put an end to that discussion. The idea was revived again in the beginning of the 1970s. A possibility of establishing the museum seemed feasible but the location was problematic. Proximity of some large artillery garrison was considered best for the museum. In the heart of Satakunta, in Niinisalo, a suitable building was found. An empty school of Saloharju was rented to Tykkimiehet Association by the borough of Kankaanp√§√§. The large artillery garrison of Niinisalo was placed quite near. The museum was founded on 2 July 1977 in Niinisalo under the name Artillery Museum (Tykist√∂museo in Finnish). The great public did not, however, quite find its way to the museum, probably because of its remoteness. A campaign for finding a new location was launched. Linnankasarmi at H√§meenlinna, with its vacant barracks, begun to feel attractive. The new Artillery Museum was opened to the public on 12 May 1997. The name of the museum was changed 1.1.2004 to The Artillery Museum of Finland. Location and opening hours The Artillery Museum of Finland is located at H√§meenlinna in the Linnakasarmi area. The buildings of Linnankasarmi date back to the Russian regime, to the Autonomy 1809‚Äì1917. The construction of the barracks started in 1850 and was completed in 1913. The archaeological committee values Linnankasarmi quite highly as a traditional military area and prehistoric site because the medieval town of H√§meenlinna has once been here and its remains are still under the barrack yard. Moreover, H√§me Castle is right next door and its century's long tradition includes also artillery. The Artillery Museum of Finland is open all year round 24.8.-31.3 open from 11 to 17 and 1.4-23.8 open from 10 to 18 In the museum there is also a cafeteria run by the volunteer women who work with conscripts. Permanent exhibition The permanent exhibition displays in three floors the history of artillery in Finland and the military history on the nation. =First floor= On the ground floor of the main building the birth of our artillery centuries ago is on display. The story proceeds from the War of Finland 1808-1809 through the period of Autonomy to the Finnish Civil War and to the J√§ger Movement. A muzzleloader called Helvig, a cannon dating back to the War of Finland 1808-1809 is one of the guns worth mentioning. On the center passage of each floor there are projectiles from different periods and different guns. =Second floor= The second floor brings the visitor to the times of the winter and Continuation Wars. The firing methods of the field artillery and of the subjects connected, demonstrate the high technical know-how of the Finnish artillery. The study of the Artillery General Vilho Nenonen is also in this floor. The proto type of the Nenon ‚Äì camera is on display in this room. The floor of the artillery veterans ends with the present time and with its objects. Special branches, such as artillery intelligence, communications and survey activities are placed on this floor. On display is also the uniform of V√§in√∂ Myllyrinne, the largest Finnish soldier ever at 226 centimeters some 7 foot and 5 inches tall. =Third floor= The third floor displays the life of the Marshal of Finland Gustaf Mannerheim, and for example the honorary gun, a Finnish 105 H 37 light howitzer on which gun carriage Mannerheim was escorted to the eternal rest in the winter 1951 is on display. Also is shown the life in the Finnish army after the Second World War and the technological development of artillery is also given special consideration. Gun hall 120 K 78-16 in front of the gun hall. The gun collection of the museum is unique, the most comprehensive in the Scandinavia. As far as it is known there is no other museum outside Russia with a collection on Russian and Soviet artillery equipment as exhaustive as this. The amount of the pieces in the museum is now 90 different cannons plus heavy grenade launchers and rocket launchers. In the gun hall are located the rarest guns in the museum.

State ‚Äì 78% Special education In December 2010, the district administration reported that 144 pupils or 13% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 48% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, the District administration reported that 147 pupils or 13% of the district's pupils received Special Education services, with 47.6% of the identified pupils having specific learning disabilities. To comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the school district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. Brockway Area School District received a $698,231 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2012‚Äì13 and 2011‚Äì12 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010‚Äì11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 63 or 5.74% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Enrollment Brockway Area School District has a low enrollment which is projected to continue to decline through 2015. The Class of 2013 has 58 pupils. The class of 2011, was 79 pupils. The Class of 2007 had 90 pupils.Pennsylvania DEpartment of Education, Enrollment and projections by LEA, July 20, 2010 Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater).The Center for Rural Pennsylvania., \\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", October 2009 As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools continue to rise. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the United States. In Pennsylvania, 80% of school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts had enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007.

Designated funds and any other funds, such as capital reserves, are allocated to specific projects. School districts are required by state law to keep 5 percent of their annual spending in the undesignated reserve funds to preserve bond ratings. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, from 2003 to 2010, as a whole, Pennsylvania school districts amassed nearly $3 billion in reserved funds.Murphy, Jan., Pennsylvania's public schools boost reserves, CentreDaily Times, September 22, 2010 In October 2010, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted a performance audit of the District. The findings were reported to the school board and administration. In December 2012, the Pennsylvania Auditor General conducted another performance audit of the District. Students who live in the District's attendance range may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. Or a student living in a neighboring public school district may seek admission to Brockway Area School District. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. Elementary School ‚Äì $8,985.70, High School ‚Äì $10,087.22 The district is funded by a combination of: a local income tax ‚Äì 1%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government.

The state's hold harmless policy regarding state basic education funding continued where a district received at least the same amount as the year before, even where enrollment had significantly declined. The amount of increase each school district receives was set by Governor Edward G. Rendell and then Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak, as a part of the state budget proposal given each February. This was the second year of Governor Rendell's policy to fund some districts at a far greater rate than others.

This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students. For 2010‚Äì11, Brockway Area School District applied for and received $216,490 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The District used the funding to provide full-day kindergarten. Classrooms for the Future grant The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and paid for teacher training to optimize the computers use. The program was funded from 2006 to 2009. The Brockway Area School District did not apply to participate in 2006‚Äì07 or in 2007‚Äì08. The district received $83,715 in 2008‚Äì09. In Jefferson County, the highest award, $807,235, was given to Punxsutawney Area School District. The highest funding statewide was awarded to Philadelphia City School District in Philadelphia County ‚Äì $9,409,073. Other grants Brockway Area School District did not participate in the following grants: PA Department of Environmental Protection Environmental Education grants, Science Its Elementary grants, Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning Grants and Safe Schools Target grant 2012. =Common Cents state initiative= Brockway Area School Board elected to not participate in the Pennsylvania Department of Education Common Cents program. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars. After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. =Federal Stimulus grant= The district received an extra $2,203,974 in ARRA ‚Äì Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. Race to the Top grant District officials applied for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided over one million dollars in additional federal funding to improve student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010. =Real estate taxes= Property tax rates in 2012‚Äì13 were set by the school board at 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and mills in 20.8500 Elk County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate ‚Äì land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75‚Äì85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. The school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, necessitating a State board equalization of the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. *2011-11 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 20.7700 mills in Elk CountyPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2011 *2010‚Äì11 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 21.1000 mills in Elk CountyPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2010 *2009‚Äì10 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 22.0000 mills in Elk County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District 2009‚Äì10, 2009 *2008‚Äì09 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 22.0000 mills in Elk County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District 2008‚Äì09, 2008 *2007‚Äì08 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 23.6000 mills in Elk County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2007 *2006‚Äì07 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 23.6000 mills in Elk County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 *2005‚Äì06 ‚Äì 16.0000 mills in Jefferson County and 60.4000 mills in Elk County.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2005 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008‚Äì09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances ‚Äì Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010‚Äì11, 2011 The average yearly property tax paid by Jefferson County residents amounts to about 2.52% of their yearly income. Jefferson County is ranked 949th of the 3143 United States counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. The average yearly property tax paid by Elk County residents amounts to about 2.89% of their yearly income. Elk County is ranked 668th for property taxes as a percentage of median income.Tax-rates.org., County Property Taxes 2012, 2012 Act 1 Adjusted Index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

For the exception for pension costs, 194 school districts received approval to exceed the Index. For special education costs, 129 districts received approval to exceed the tax limit.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Report on Referendum Exceptions For School Year 2012‚Äì2013, March 30, 2012 For the 2011‚Äì12 school year, the Brockway Area School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index. Each year, the Brockway Area School Board has the option of adopting either 1) a resolution in January certifying they will not increase taxes above their index or 2) a preliminary budget in February. A school district adopting the resolution may not apply for referendum exceptions or ask voters for a tax increase above the inflation index. A specific timeline for these decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. According to a state report, for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year budgets, 247 school districts adopted a resolution certifying that tax rates would not be increased above their index; 250 school districts adopted a preliminary budget. Of the 250 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget, 231 adopted real estate tax rates that exceeded their index. Tax rate increases in the other 19 school districts that adopted a preliminary budget did not exceed the school district's index. Of the districts who sought exceptions: 221 used the pension costs exemption and 171 sought a Special Education costs exemption. Only 1 school district sought an exemption for Nonacademic School Construction Project, while 1 sought an exception for Electoral debt for school construction. The Brockway Area School Board did not apply for any exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budget in 2011. For 2009‚Äì10 school budget, the board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Index. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases.

However, he turned down offers to play professional sports, and instead accepted a nomination to attend the United States Military Academy at West Point. While there, Guckeyson was no longer eligible to play football, but was named a first-team All-American in soccer in 1941.Award Winners (PDF), 2002 NCAA Soccer Records Book, p. 69, National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2002, retrieved 22 December 2008. Once again, he was elected as class president. Guckeyson graduated from West Point in 1942 and received a commission as an officer in the United States Army. He again turned down offers for a professional sports career when the former Washington Senators manager, Clark Griffith, and pitcher, Walter Johnson, asked him to join the major league. He attended flight school and was certified as a fighter pilot in the United States Army Air Forces before being deployed overseas in December 1942. As a fighter pilot, Guckeyson earned a Purple Heart, three Air Medals, and two Distinguished Flying Crosses‚Äîthe fourth-highest award for combat valor in flight. While serving in the 375th Fighter Squadron, 361st Fighter Group, Guckeyson flew a P-47 Thunderbolt (\\"Contrary Mary\\") and, after his unit transitioned to the newer airframe, a P-51 Mustang (serial: 42-103349) fighter aircraft. He was credited with at least 2.5 enemy aircraft kills in aerial combat: two Bf 109 fighters and a Ju-188 night fighter, which was destroyed with the assistance of another pilot.Encounter Report (I), WWII Aircraft Performance, retrieved 24 December 2008.Encounter Report (II), WWII Aircraft Performance, retrieved 24 December 2008.Encounter Report (III), WWII Aircraft Performance, retrieved 24 December 2008.

Designed by architect Thomas Fulljames, building started in 1844 and completed in 1848. Initially a hospital for up to 200 people with psychiatric illness, by the mid-20th century it housed 1,500 patients. The institution was wound down as a healthcare facility from 1991, finally closing in 1995. There was much damage caused to the structure and its contents in the years subsequent to closure. The site was compulsorily purchased by Denbighshire Council in 2018 and plans were announced late that year for its redevelopment as housing. HistoryBackground= This north-east view of the hospital at Denbigh, for the treatment of the insane The origins of North Wales Hospital lay in a reform movement for care of insane people that began in the late 18th century and continued until a few years after its opening as the Denbigh Asylum in 1848. Prior to this time the belief had been that the afflictions of insane people should be dealt with by such methods as bloodletting and flagellation to disperse their inner demons, together with seclusion and manacling as means of control if they posed some sort of threat. There were privately operated care institutions of dubious merit but such civic responsibility as was felt to exist was deemed to be within the purview of the penal and Poor Law systems until the passing of the County Asylums Act in 1808, which provided for publicly administered specialist facilities. Treatment remained degrading, loosely monitored and poor until the passing of the 1845 Lunacy Act but the intervening years saw an increased recognition, both in parliament and elsewhere, that something needed to be done to harmonise and improve standards of care. =Foundation= Official reports as late as 1844 noted that there was almost no civic provision for care of the insane in Wales, the condition and treatment of whom was often appalling. However, a meeting of some of the great and the good of North Wales - nobility, gentry and clergy - at Denbighshire Infirmary in October 1842 had resolved that they should subscribe to action for improved care and that this should take the form of a hospital for the insane. Historian M. Rolf Olsen summarised the resolutions of this meetings as clearly stating Despite these hopes, some of which were indeed achieved when the hospital opened, the enterprise remained reliant on private subscription almost until its target was achieved, with the Welsh county authorities refusing to take any financial responsibility until late in the process and amidst much legal wrangling. Determined to proceed despite their petition to the authorities having failed at first instance, progress in raising funds was initially slow but received a significant fillip following an inspired appeal to the royal family, from whom they received in excess of ¬£200 and then many other donations from elsewhere as a consequence of that patronage. Eventually, the counties of Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Merionethshire were persuaded to become parties to the project and the law was changed to enable them to combine for that purpose. Designed by architect Thomas Fulljames and constructed on of land donated by a local benefactor, Joseph Ablett of Llanbedr Hall, the hospital was initially intended to accommodate 200 patients. The capital cost was around ¬£27,500, including the ¬£2,000 value attributed to the land. This was reasonable when compared to other asylums of the time but, at ¬£137 per bed, was substantially greater than the ¬£40 cost per person that applied to workhouse accommodation. =Deviation from intent= In one significant aspect, the new hospital soon took on some of the characteristics of the system that it intended to replace. The subscribers had hoped that the hospital would provide a sympathetic environment for restorative treatment rather than just being a costly unwelcome dumping ground away from general society, as the workhouses were deemed to be. A change in national concerns from emphasis on conditions of care to that of protecting wider society, which ultimately led to the 1890 Lunacy Act, meant that the hospital assumed a character similar to that of the workhouse. Patient welfare and therapeutics became of little importance when set against the primary requirement of a strict admissions procedure and a custodial role, leading to stigmatisation of those who were admitted. According to Olsen, the tendency towards a custodial role is evident in the increased density of the patient population: in all but 15 of the years between 1848 and 1938, more patients were admitted than the total of those who were discharged or died. That the capacity was set at 200 beds when the number of identified cases in the six counties of North Wales was then around 450 may have reflected the initial optimism of treatment rather than custody. Following the initial building works of 1844-1848, there were ongoing, sometimes acrimonious, debates concerning the extent of overcrowding and how to resolve it, which included the possibility of building another asylum to cater for three of the counties and thus spread the load. There were substantial extensions between 1862-1865 that resulted in a new wing designed by Thomas Lockwood to house an additional 150 patients, then additional adjoining farms were purchased to improve hospital self-sufficiency and Glanywern Hall was purchased as overflow accommodation. There were further expansions on the original site in 1881, between 1895-1910 and in 1931. By 1956, the hospital was catering for 1500 patients. Subsequent to that time, patient numbers decreased. Aside from the desires of the founders being impeded by changing attitudes to function, their belief that the hospital would also save the public purse also proved to be misguided. The problem in that instance was a misunderstanding: their forecast that savings of five shillings per week per patient were possible was undermined by the reality that, at the time of foundation, very few Welsh people in need of treatment were in fact being treated and thus the absolute costs involved in such treatment were trivial. For example, contemporary records indicated that only 36 \\"pauper lunatics\\" were being treated in the equivalent English county asylums, paid for by the Welsh public purse, in 1842 while 1,010 were recorded as living with friends and a small number were elsewhere. The total number of people actually in need of treatment far exceeded the number in English institutions, and thus costs associated with the hospital became a burden on public finances rather than a relief. Charges levied by the hospital varied according to the classification of the patient: private patients paid as much as 46 shillings per week (¬£120 per annum) in 1849 whilst at the other extreme the pauper lunatics from contributing authorities were charged at nine shillings. =Administration and staffing= Until the formation of the National Health Service in 1948, the hospital was governed by a Committee of Visitors comprising representatives of the five subscribing counties and also other individual subscribers. These people were influential outside the hospital as well as within it. Day-to-day management was the responsibility of the Medical Superintendent, who was assisted by the holder of the office of Steward and Clerk. The Commissioners in Lunacy, which was an inspectorate that existed from around 1845 to 1913, regularly criticised the hospital's staffing arrangements and overcrowding. At the time of opening, the hospital had a staff of 20, including a married couple who acted as gatekeepers, a clerk, cook, kitchen maid, housemaid, smith/engineer and two laundry maids. Until 1860, the patients were left to their own devices between 10 pm and 6 am, when no staff were assigned to duties; thereafter, for many years one member of staff was assigned during those hours to each side of the hospital. Clwyd Wynne, who has studied the history of the hospital, says From the outset and for many years thereafter, attendant staff were selected on the basis of their musical and/or sporting ability, size and ability to speak the Welsh language. They first received training in 1892, when 42 passed the examinations of the St John's Ambulance Association. =Treatment= Male and female patients were housed in separate wings and those who were able were employed in tasks within the hospital grounds. The males worked the gardens and in the gardens and the on-site farm, as well as being engaged in tailoring, shoemaking and joinery; the females were assigned duties in the wash-house and with sewing. Other labouring tasks were assigned at various times, such as painting and decorating the structure, while those patients who might abscond were in the early years made continuously to pump water so that they could be more easily monitored. Wynne notes that \\"The only 'treatments' available for many years were employment, recreational and spiritual activities and physical care\\", and that the hospital departmental infrastructure would not have been able to function if the patient labour had not been available. Aside from employment within the hospital and social activities, such as dances and concerts, which often were led by the staff but also involved visits from or to external organisations, treatment was initially limited to sedation using chloral hydrate and, from 1871, Turkish baths. It seems from the comments of the Medical Superintendent of the time that the baths were intended to treat the body odours that he thought to be a symptom of insanity. The hospital spent more on alcohol than on drugs until the early 1900s. It was from around the same time, with the arrival of a new Assistant Medical Officer, that social events expanded to include sports such as tennis and football. There were also dramas and magic lantern shows, as well as picnics, concerts and dances. That doctor, Frank Jones, later became Medical Superintendent (1913-1940) and encouraged many other changes, including to treatment and training, which resulted in what Wynne describes as \\"a more liberal attitude towards mental illness\\". Patients who died were initially buried at Llanfarchell and later, from the 1880s, at Denbigh's town cemetery. =Closure= Plans for closure were drawn up in 1987 as part of the national Care in the Community initiative which could trace its roots to the thoughts of Enoch Powell when he was Minister for Health in the 1960s. The North Wales Hospital was eventually closed in sections from 1991 to 2002, with the main unit being shut down in 1995. The Wellcome Foundation provided a grant of ¬£130,000 in 2017 to assist with cataloguing and preservation of the hospital records, which form the largest single such collection held by Denbighshire Archives. Comprising material such as patient records, annual reports and committee minutes, financial records, plans and staff records, much of the material has limited access arrangements due to issues relating to patient confidentiality. Subsequent developments The hospital site was sold in 1999 for ¬£155,000, after various proposals to convert it for use as a college, hotel or army barracks had come to nothing; a subsequent suggestion around 2012 that it might be used as the site for a new super-prison also faltered. It was purchased by Acebench Investments in 2003 for ¬£310,000, then transferred to an offshore company, Freemont, that was registered in the British Virgin Islands, and then to Freemont (Denbigh) Limited. There were claims of obfuscation and \\"playing silly games\\" regarding the true ownership, with one person at various times claiming to be involved with all three of those companies and at other times claiming otherwise. Since closure, the hospital buildings have been subject to wide-scale looting and vandalism, as well as numerous arson attacks, such as those of November 2008 and April 2018. Fires in February and July 2017 resulted in an announcement that sections of the hospital would have to be demolished due to them being beyond repair. Some of the early damage to the structures following closure, such as the blowing up of doors, was a consequence of the site being used for a joint exercise by North Wales Police and the armed forces. \\"Enabling\\" planning permission was granted to the owners, with the purpose of development being to provide the funds to restore the listed buildings. This permission, which involved construction of up to 280 houses, together with business and community facilities, lapsed in 2009. The developers, Freemont, said that the world economic downturn from the late 2000s had stymied their plans; they had also refused to take action to remedy the deterioration of the structures, which resulted in Denbighshire Council serving an urgent works notice in June 2011 and then soon after issuing a dangerous structures notice. The Council spent over ¬£930,000 in resolution of the emergency work required by the notice but the owners refused to recompense, claiming several concerns including the actual amount being claimed. From around 2012, Denbighshire Council were intending to compulsorily purchase the property and then transfer ownership to the North Wales Building Preservation Trust (NWBPT), which had been established in 2012 specifically to enable conservation of the site. NWBPT's non-profit status was claimed to provide a means of doing so in a situation where the costs were such that margins were too slim to make the project commercially viable; however, Freemont kept raising the asking price for transfer of ownership. A compulsory purchase order had been granted against Freemont in 2015 after they had failed to comply with a Repairs Notice but the completion of the transfer was still subject to procedural niceties. The owners had unsuccessfully attempted various appeals to overturn the costs and compulsory purchase orders. They then tried to sell the site at auction in May 2016, which would have necessitated the council pursuing the new owners for compulsory purchase, but it failed to reach its ¬£2.25m reserve price. Working in partnership with The Prince's Regeneration Trust, NWBPT obtained enabling planning consent to convert some of the buildings into apartments, demolish others and also a part of the main listed structure, and build up to 200 houses and business units in the grounds. A counter-proposal emerged in April 2018, involving the construction of two hotels and some housing by Signature Living, who claimed that unlike the other proposals theirs would retain all of the extant original buildings. In September 2018, the Council successfully took over ownership under the terms of the compulsory purchase order. By that time, the Council was intending to work in concert with Jones Bros. Civil Engineering, a construction company based in Ruthin that was partnering with NWBPT. The decision to prefer this solution to that proposed by Signature Living had been made in April of that year. Plans for development of 300 houses on the site were revealed in December 2018, with the proposals expected to require demolition of half of the remaining listed structures. The site at that time was reported to comprise around , although an earlier report at the time of the auction had stated . Notable patients George Maitland Lloyd Davies, nonconformist minister and pacifist politician, died there in 1949. Architecture Writing in 1974, Olsen noted that the location, whilst geographically central for the counties that it served, was remote from the point of view of many potential visitors and that this may have impeded social interaction, which is nowadays considered an important element of mental health care. He said that The original 1840s main range of North Wales Hospital building, constructed from local limestone in the Jacobean style, is listed as Grade II*. The range had three wings round a quadrangle and subsequently a central clock tower housing a chapel was installed; the latter was the gift of Joseph Ablett's widow, Ablett having died early in 1848 prior to the hospital opening. Other structures, including a later chapel, nurses home, isolation hospital and Erddig Ward, have been listed as Grade II. The new chapel, designed in the Gothic style by Lloyd Williams and Underwood, dates from 1862, may have been amended by 1899. Lighting initially came from candles and oil lamps, with heating by coal fire. During 1862-1865, when Lockwood's new wing was constructed, a separate house was also built for the Medical Superintendent. The expansion of 1881 saw a new dining hall capable of seating 440 people and also a new wing to house 160 males. The substantial further expansion that took place between 1895-1910 required demolition of some existing facilities and provided new wards, accommodation for staff, an isolation hospital, new kitchen and laundry facilities, and boilers. These complex works, involving designs by Lockwood's firm and that of Ellison and Son, of Liverpool, also saw plans to convert to electric lighting: coal gas lights supplied from an on-site gasworks had replaced the candles and lamps but was proving to be inadequate.

So this heroine is suddenly doing this terrible thing.\\" \\"I was supposed to be this monument of goodness.\\" StorylinePenny and Jeff= One of the first love stories of the show was that of Penny Hughes and Jeff Baker. When they fell in love Penny's mother, Nancy Hughes disapproved of the relationship. Penny then accused her mother of loving her dead sister more than her. Penny eloped with Jeff and they were going to run away but decided to turn around. Nancy insisted the marriage be annulled. Al James, one of their classmates, called Penny a tramp and teased Jeff so one day Jeff got into a fight with him and ended up killing him and being charged with murder. Penny started to date Tom Pope and Nancy was happy. When Tom overheard Jeff declare his love for Penny, Tom left her and she and Jeff get married in a church. Jeff's mother Grace wanted him to resign for the business but when Jeff overheard that he began to drink and left Oakdale and went to another town and assumed the name of Jack Baily. Penny was saddened by it and Nancy wanted her to divorce Jeff but she wouldn't. Penny and Greg Williams made a date which Meg Blaine overheard and doesn't tell her Jeff is in the hospital. Jeff returned to town and Penny was about to divorce him but decided to take him back. They get married again with their parents blessing' but tragedy struck when they got into a car accident which killed Jeff instantly and put Penny into a coma. =Penny's new love= As Penny was walking in the park she met a guy by the name of Neil Wade. Neil was really a doctor but didn't want anybody to know that but they soon found out. Penny and Neil marry and live in an apartment. Neil then decided to open the \\"Wade Book Shop.\\" The accident had left Penny with a bout of amnesia. With no memory of who she was, Penny became friends with Neil Wade and started to fall in love with him. Neil was estranged from his mother and Penny felt an urge to help them reconcile. Then, finally, on one stormy night, Penny regained her memory. Realizing that Jeff had been killed in the accident, distraught, Penny ran out into the rain calling his name. After dealing with Jeff's death, Penny soon married Neil. During this time, Neil's family pressured him into returning to medicine. However, the stress of medicine became too much for him and, when he almost lost a patient due to his ineptness, he lashed out at everyone and quit. Finally, he realized that Penny was not the cause of his problems and, with some help from his father, Dr. Doug Cassen, he opened a bookstore. For the next few years the Wades were blissfully happy until Neil's tragic death. Several years later, Penny found romance again with Roy McGuire, her sister- in-law, Sandy's, ex-husband. When Sandy became ill, Penny helped Roy care for his son, Jimmy. Soon, Penny became attached to Jimmy and convinced Roy to marry her so that they could get custody. Eventually, though Roy decided that Jimmy belonged with his mother and dropped the suit. Realizing that she only married Roy because of Jimmy, Penny had the marriage annulled. Feeling that Oakdale had nothing left to offer, Penny moved to New York City and later England where she met and married Anton Cunningham, a race car driver. In 1972, Penny sent her adopted daughter, Amy Lin, to stay with Nancy and Chris when she had a major disagreement with Anton. A well-spoken, intelligent young lady, Amy was welcomed warmly by the Hugheses but felt like an outcast with most of the Americans her age. Penny‚Äôs nephew, Tom, discovered that Amy's grandmother, Mrs. Parsons, was by coincidence, a resident of Oakdale and a patient of Dr. Rick Ryan's. Mrs. Parsons and her husband were overjoyed to find their granddaughter. However, uncomfortable in her new surroundings, Amy soon returned to Penny and Anton in England. =Later years= Penny has returned to Oakdale on occasion, including Bob and Kim's wedding, her parents' 50th anniversary, her father's funeral, her mother's 80th birthday (during which she uttered the immortal line, \\"Who are all these people?\\" when a flock of new characters interrupted Nancy's party). In 2000 Penny returned for a Christmas visit paid for by Emily Stewart, Ellen's granddaughter.

He was also one of the most notorious prisoner escapees of his time, popularly referred to as the \\"American Jack Sheppard\\", successfully escaping from virtually every major prison in the eastern United States including The Tombs and Sing Sing. Mahaney also escaped from custody which included well-publicized incidents where he jumped from a train without injury.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 222-223) Sifakis, Carl. The Dictionary of Historic Nicknames: A Treasury of More Than 7,500 Famous and Infamous Nicknames from World History. New York: Facts on File Publications, 1984. (pg. 13) Biography Jack Mahaney was born in New York City in 1844. When he was 10, his father died and he was sent to a boarding school by his mother. He was, by all accounts, a mischievous student who was frequently in trouble at the school and eventually ran away after being flogged repeatedly by teachers. When police found him, Mahaney was in company with a gang of teenage \\"dock rats\\" and was placed in the House of Refuge. He escaped from the juvenile institution, along with a dozen other youths, and fled to the Five Points. Mahaney joined the gang of Italian Dave, the famed sneak thief and fagin, whose group of street urchins and pickpockets were among the notorious thieves of the Five Points. Italian Dave had between 30-40 youths, between the ages of 9 and 15, whom he housed in a Paradise Square tenement building. It was here that Mahaney was trained to steal along with Italian Dave's other pupils.Johnson, Claudia Durst. Youth Gangs in Literature: Exploring Social Issues Through Literature. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. (pg. 21) Practicing on dummies dressed as men and women, Mahaney and the others learned how to pickpocket and snatch valuables such as purses and muffs. They were also instructed on begging and stealing from store windows and counters. Whenever a student was clumsy or otherwise displeased Italian Dave, their leader, dressed in a policeman's uniform, would hit them with a nightstick. Mahaney was very successful in this trade and, becoming a noted pickpocket and sneak thief in his own right, was personally taken under the wing of Italian Dave and made his prot√©g√©. He was also allowed privileges given to few others including going on marauding expeditions where he and Italian Dave would roll a drunk or snatch a purse. Mahaney eventually left the gang as he entered adulthood and formed his own gang of butcher cart thieves active in the Five Points. He also became a noted confidence man and swindler in his later years.

History Macedonia and the Chalcidice In the spring of 432 BCE, during the first phase of the Peloponnesian War, several cities of Chalcidice broke away from the Athenian-dominated Delian League. The inhabitants of these cities abandoned them and moved to Olynthos in an act of synoecism, forming a single state and adopting the demonym \\"Chalcidians\\". Exactly what form it took is a matter of academic dispute. By the terms of the Peace of Nicias of 421 BCE, Athens and Sparta agreed that it should be broken up, but it seems clear that Athens failed to enforce this. Luckily for the Chalcidians, the attention of the two great powers was soon diverted away from them‚Äîindeed for this reason nothing is heard of Olynthos and the Chalcidians until 393/2 BCE‚Äî and the Spartan governors installed by Brasidas were soon withdrawn. In the aftermath of the Peace of Nicias, the city-states of Argilus, Akanthos, and Stageira, as well as other unnamed ones, joined. The League continued to expand in the early 4th century BCE. In 393/2, Amyntas III of Macedon temporarily transferred some territory to Olynthos, during a period when he was driven out of Macedon by the Illyrians. It was restored when Amyntas regained power. Eight years later, Amyntas, who was again in trouble, handed over territory, this time to the entire League. The League were not so ready to return what they held, which now included Pella, the Macedonian capital. In 383, Amyntas appealed to Sparta and at the same time a similar appeal came from Akanthos and Apollonia, two League members who claimed that membership of the League was not voluntary but had been forced upon them at the point of the sword.The Historians' History of the World, editor: Henry Smith Williams, vol. 4 pp. 129-30 Sparta was keen to respond to the request. Among Sparta's allies there was no animosity against the Chalcidian League. Nevertheless, when the question was put, fear of annoying Sparta ensured that the proposal was carried, and a force of 10,000 was authorized to be sent.History of Greece by G. Grote, 1862, vol. 9, p. 49 An advance force of 2,000 was sent under Eudamidas which succeeded in separating Potidaea from the League.Xenophon, Hellenica 5.2 The fighting was long and arduous. Teleutias, the half-brother of the Spartan king, Agesilaus II, was killed and King Agesipolis suffered heavy losses before dying of fever. However, in 379 BCE the cities of the former League became \\"autonomous\\" and subject allies of Sparta. Freeman [who is Freeman?] regards the Spartan dissolution of the League as one of the most \\"calamitous events\\" in Hellenic history for, in his view, the League uniting the northern Greek cities with the most Hellenised cities of Macedonia would have prevented the rise of Philip II of Macedon.History of federal government, Edward Augustus Freeman, p. 191 Already in 375 BCE the Chalcidians threw off Spartan control and re-established the League, joining the Second Athenian League. They soon fell out with Athens over control of Amphipolis, and in the subsequent war lost a number of cities, including Torone and Potidaea. As a result the Chalcidians allied themselves with Philip II of Macedon, and the League once again expanded to include 34 cities, but in 348 BCE Philip captured and destroyed Olynthos, putting an end to the League. Internal organization The actual form of the League is uncertain. It seems it was a genuinely federal state (sympoliteia), although Olynthos played the dominant role. The League had a federal citizenship, common laws, foreign policy, coinage, and military. There was a citizen assembly that also had judicial functions. The League was apparently headed by an eponymous official, possibly a strategos. Its constitution was probably based on the Boeotian League. Political rights are likely to have been reserved to a group of 8000 designated by a property qualification. It included most but not all the Euboean colonies of Chalcidice. The symbol of the Chalcidians was the lyre, struck upon the coins the League.

Her music has been noted for combining elements of electronic, industrial, classical, and goth. Born in Phoenix, Arizona, she spent her formative years in northern Wisconsin, where she began writing and recording music independently while attending college. During her second year of studies, she released two singles through the independent label Sacred Bones, followed by two EPs. Her debut album, The Spoils, was released in 2009. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, she released her second full-length record, Stridulum II (2010), followed by Conatus (2011). Her fourth album, Taiga (2014), released by Mute Records, marked a departure from her previous releases, and featured a more prominent pop-influenced sound. Her fifth studio album, Okovi, was released in 2017. Biography1989‚Äì2008: Early life and career beginnings= Nicole Rose Hummel was born April 11, 1989 in Phoenix, Arizona, where she spent her early years. Her parents are first-generation Americans, with combinations of Russian as well as German, Slovenian, and Ukrainian descent. Her grandparents immigrated to the United States from Odessa, Ukraine, and settled in North Dakota. Honoring her ancestry, she formally goes by her Slavic name, Nika Roza Danilova. She has one older brother. During her childhood, she and her family relocated to Merrill, Wisconsin, where they lived on a rural property situated in of forest. \\"I resented my parents for having moved me away from Phoenix because I thought Phoenix was much more interesting than Wisconsin,\\" she said. \\"It's a great place and it's very interesting there, beautiful.\\" She attended Wausau West High School, and after, enrolled at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee to study business. She began recording music at home while still in college, using keyboards, drum machines and other instruments. Her performing name, Zola Jesus, is a compound derived from the French writer √âmile Zola, and the Christian messiah. While studying at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, she debuted the singles \\"Poor Sons\\" on Die Stasi and \\"Soeur Sewer\\", released in 2008 by Sacred Bones Records, after which she transferred to the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In 2009, while still in college, she recorded her debut full-length The Spoils, released by Sacred Bones in July 2009. In 2010, she graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison with a double major in French and philosophy. =2009‚Äì2012: Stridulum II and Conatus= Zola Jesus performing in Manchester, 2010 Then followed Tsar Bomba EP (on Troubleman), New Amsterdam compilation on Sacred Bones and an untitled, limited-edition vinyl split with Burial Hex (Aurora Borealis). For touring she recruited Dead Luke (synths), bassist Lindsay Mikkola and drummer Max Elliott. Later the line-up changed to Shane Verwey and Nick Turco (synth), Alex DeGroot, and Nick Johnson, a drummer with metal band Jex Thoth. Zola Jesus has also played with Former Ghosts. On Fever Ray's 2010 European tour, she performed as a support act and also toured with The xx. In the late 2009 collaboration between Zola Jesus and Rory Kane took shape (as Nika+Rory), a demo being put out on MySpace. In March 2010, Zola Jesus released the Stridulum EP, named after the 1979 horror film of the same name by director Giulio Paradisi. After the release Zola Jesus performed at the SXSW Festival, for her second time. The same year, she issued a second EP, Valusia, also released on Sacred Bones. In July 2010, a collaborative third EP LA Vampires Meets Zola Jesus, was released. A collaboration with Amanda Brown of Pocahaunted, this EP presented \\"a dingy, lower-than-lo-fi sound and very little of what one would call traditional songwriting,\\" according to Larry Fitzmaurice of Pitchfork. Danilova followed these three EPs with her second full-length album, Stridulum II, which was released in August 2010, one month after LA Vampires Meets Zola Jesus. This album marked her feature full-length release in the United Kingdom, combining all six songs from the Stridulum EP (in a different sequence), along with three of the four tracks on the Valusia EP; the cover artwork is a slightly-altered version of the artwork from the Stridulum EP. Laura Snapes of NME praised the album as a \\"gorgeously ethereal soundscape of a thousand years of heartbreak unleashed into one might howl.\\" Additionally, NME ranked it the seventh-best album of the year. In 2011, Danilova began composing her third full-length studio album, Conatus, which she co-produced with Brian Foote of Jackie-O Motherfucker and Cloudland Canyon. The album, released in September 2011 and named for the Latin word for \\"moving forward,\\" featured less electronic components than Danilova's previous records, and included cello, double bass, violin, and viola. \\"I just wanted to try out new ways to produce and different ways to write,\\" Danilova commented. \\"And with this new record it's a lot more stripped down and there are way more acoustic elements as opposed to no acoustic elements ... I just wanted more breathing room, so people could insert their own experiences into the song, their own feelings into the song, as opposed to me forcing it on them with the densest sound possible.\\" Additionally, Danilova provided guest vocals on the song \\"Intro\\" by M83 from their 2011 album Hurry Up, We're Dreaming. She also sang on \\"New France\\" by Orbital, from their 2012 album Wonky. =2013‚Äìpresent: Taiga and Okovi= Zola Jesus performing at Webster Hall, New York City, 2014 In August 2013, Versions, a set of neo-classical reworkings of previous tracks from Zola Jesus releases, in a collaboration with producer JG Thirlwell, was released through Sacred Bones. After having resided in Los Angeles for a period, Danilova found living in a large city was negatively impacting her ability to concentrate, and relocated to Vermont, followed by her native Wisconsin, before settling in Washington to begin completing her new record. On June 18, 2014, she announced the release of her fourth studio album, Taiga. This album, released by Mute Records, features a more prominent pop influence than her previous releases, with Danilova drawing inspiration from popular vocalists such as Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand. \\"I was a child of the Nineties,\\" she commented. \\"I grew up on Britney Spears, the Spice Girls, and I was listening to a lot of vocal music. You know, divas ‚Äî Mariah Carey, Aaliyah, Barbra Streisand ‚Äî strong female vocals. [On this record] I wanted to be really confident in my voice, which is usually very intense.\\" In 2017, Danilova relocated to her hometown of Merrill, Wisconsin, and built a home on her family's property. In September 2017, she returned to Sacred Bones to release her fifth studio album, Okovi, which she wrote after a protracted bout of depression. Prior to composing the album, Danilova said she spent time \\"watching movies, reading books, then I moved back to Wisconsin, started building my house, but mostly I was just trying to give myself time to live, because you write an album, then you tour and you forget you are a human being, you become a gipsy in a way, so it has been important to me to give myself more time to live outside of the music.\\" The album marked her first to feature guitar instrumentation. In May 2020, Danilova announced the release of her first live album, Live at Roadburn 2018, which features 12 live tracks from the 2018 Roadburn Festival in the Netherlands. It was initially made available via Bandcamp, and scheduled for a CD and double-LP release in June 2020. ArtistryInfluences= Danilova has stated that she has been influenced by a number of singers and bands, including Ian Curtis, Lydia Lunch, Diamanda Gal√°s, Throbbing Gristle, and Swans. On her fourth album, Taiga, she mentioned mainstream pop artists such as Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand as being influences on her vocal performance. =Vocals and musical style= Her style has been described variously as \\"commanded by ominous lyrics and a sultry Goth delivery,\\" According to the NME, Zola Jesus \\"wails like Kate Bush\\" on a music sometimes evoking Joy Division. Q magazine noted her for her \\"haunting vocals and swirling, electronic atmospherics... located midway between Florence Welch and Siouxsie and the Banshees.\\"Cottingham, Chris. Q magazine. #294 January 2011. The 10 New Faces of 2011. P.46 She has also been compared to Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance and Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. Numerous Zola Jesus music videos have been directed by Canadian-American director Jacqueline Castel, including \\"Vessel,\\" \\"Seekir,\\" \\"Night,\\" \\"Nail,\\" and \\"Exhumed.\\" Since 2012, Zola Jesus has collaborated with New York-based costume designer and wardrobe stylist Jenni Hensler, whose work can be seen in the videos for \\"Dangerous Days,\\" \\"Seekir,\\" and \\"Hunger,\\" and who also co-directed the remix video for \\"Ash to Bone\\" Personal life She is a cousin of Minnesota Senator and former 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar.

Perceived as race riots between communities, the main motives were related to racial tension and inner city deprivation.Kettle, Martin & Hodges, Lucy (1982) Uprising!: Police, the People and the Riots in Britain's Cities The riots were caused by a distrust of the police and authority. The most serious riots that occurred were the Brixton riots in London, the Toxteth riots in Liverpool, the Handsworth riots in Birmingham, the Chapeltown riots in Leeds, and the Moss Side riots in Manchester. There were also a series of less serious riots in other towns and cities. Context Racial tensions= In all four main cases, the areas had large ethnic minority communities, who had largely immigrated from the Commonwealth in the 1950s and 1960s to do low paid manual jobs. All the areas suffered from poor housing (mostly dating from the 19th and early 20th centuries), high unemployment and particular problems with racial tensions. According to the Scarman report which was subsequently commissioned by the UK government, the riots were a spontaneous outburst of built-up resentment sparked by particular incidents. Lord Scarman stated that \\"complex political, social and economic factors\\" created a \\"disposition towards violent protest\\". The Scarman report highlighted problems of racial disadvantage and inner-city decline, warning that \\"urgent action\\" was needed to prevent racial disadvantage becoming an \\"endemic, ineradicable disease threatening the very survival of our society\\". Brixton (London), Toxteth (Liverpool) and Chapeltown (Leeds) were originally built as affluent areas of these cities. However the relocation of industry, rising popularity of homes on new private housing estates since the 1930s, poor connections and the influx of migrant workers had led to a downfall in their fortunes and the large Victorian terraces and villas were often divided up into low rent bed sits, and many of those still existing as houses had been bought by landlords who let them to tenants. The First Thatcher ministry (Conservative Party) elected in May 1979 had instituted new powers for the police under the Vagrancy Act 1824 to stop and search people based on only a 'reasonable suspicion' that an offence had been committed - hence their common name of \\"sus laws\\". These were applied disproportionately to the black community, and caused widespread resentment amongst young black men. The majority of these were not immigrants; they were the British-born children of immigrants, mostly born in the late 1950s or the first half of the 1960s (Baby boomers). = Economic circumstances= The election of the Conservatives in 1979 had also seen the implementation by the Thatcher government of monetarist economic policies which were designed to tackle inflation, which had peaked at 27% just before the election, dropped merely to 22% in 1980 and was still above 10% by 1981. In 1979, the second oil price crisis started. Although inflation was falling by 1981, unemployment was still rising and the recession was now in its second year. By April 1981, unemployment exceeded 2.5 million, having stood at 1.5 million two years earlier. Less than a decade earlier, unemployment had still been in six figures and it had stood at less than 400,000 as recently as the early 1960s. The inner city areas affected by the 1981 riots were among those hit particularly hard by the recession and the unemployment and other social issues which came with it. This level of unemployment, not seen since the 1930s (Great Depression in the United Kingdom), had led to mass discontent in the working class areas of Britain most affected by the recession. = Police powers= The Asian community also felt isolated and vulnerable to racist attack. The police were given new powers to question people about their immigration status. Resentment arose that these laws were applied, but the police were failing to protect the Asian community from violence. On 11 July 1981, the \\"Bradford 12\\" -- a group of Asian youths, members of the \\"United Black Youth League\\" -- were arrested for manufacturing petrol bombs, allegedly to protect their community from a threatened attack. At the subsequent trial, they were acquitted by a jury, on the grounds of self defence. On 18 January 1981, thirteen Black youths died in the New Cross Fire in London when a house was reportedly petrol bombed. The police quickly dismissed a racial motive for the apparent arson attack;In the aftermath, an inquest held soon after the fire recorded an \\"open verdict\\"; and a second inquest in 2004 confirmed the conclusion. It was only with advances in forensic science in the intervening 23 years that it was finally determined that the fire was likely to have been an accident. and the local Black community were dismayed by the indifference shown in the press towards the deaths. 15,000 people marched demanding action to Central London, in the largest Black issue demonstration seen in the UK. Racial tensions continued to rise in the early part of the year. On 28 March 1981, Enoch Powell -- by then an Ulster Unionist MP, but still an influence on the Conservative Party -- gave a speech in which he warned of the dangers of a \\"racial civil war\\" in Britain. Powell had been dismissed from the shadow cabinet in 1968 by the then Tory leader Edward Heath following his controversial Rivers of Blood speech in which he predicted mass civil unrest if Commonwealth immigration continued. Three years later, when still a Tory MP, he warned of an \\"explosion\\" unless there was a massive repatriation scheme for the immigrants. Racial tension had been particularly high in Wolverhampton, where Powell was an MP, and the town was one of those affected by the less serious waves of rioting during 1981. By 6 April, overall unemployment had risen from 1.5 million to 2.5 million in 12 months; and that joblessness among ethnic minorities had risen faster, up 82% in the same period.\\"1981 riots timeline\\", Untold History (Channel Four Television), accessed 5 March 2009. During March and April, the Metropolitan Police began \\"Operation Swamp 81\\", a London-wide campaign against burglary and robbery. In Brixton, over only six days, 120 plain-clothes officers stopped 943 people, arresting 118 -- predominantly Black youths. The police justified their heavy-handed policing by statistics showing that while street robberies had increased 38% across London between 1976-80; in Brixton it had risen 138%. The first disturbances began in Brixton over the weekend of 10-12 April 1981, and were followed in July by a series of similar disturbances in more than 35 cities and towns, especially Liverpool. In London, these included Dalston, Stoke Newington, Clapham, Hounslow and Acton. Kenneth Leech, the Race Relations Field Officer of the Church of England's Board for Social Responsibility, noted \\"Here these were not race riots - riots between races. Rather the conflict was with police as symbols of white authority, with state racism and criminalisation of black communities\\".Kenneth Leech Struggle in Babylon (Sheldon Press 1988) Aftermath These riots by the unemployed called the Government to attention that strategies for helping young people into work were not working. The Youth Training Scheme and similar schemes were brought in for school leavers. The Association of Chief Police Officers, who develop police policy in England, produced their Public Order Manual in response to the riots. This was subsequently used in training by police forces throughout Britain. The UK government commissioned the Scarman report two days after the Brixton Riots. The terms of reference for the enquiry were \\"to inquire urgently into the serious disorder in Brixton on 10‚Äì12 April 1981 and to report, with the power to make recommendations\\". Scarman was concerned with the \\"plight\\" of the ethnic communities in UK inner cities and their relationship with the rest of the national \\"community\\". He concluded that it was essential that \\"people are encouraged to secure a stake in, feel a pride in, and have a sense of responsibility for their own area\\". He called for a policy of \\"direct coordinated attack on racial disadvantage\\". As a consequence of the Scarman report a new code for police behaviour was put forward in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; and the act also created an independent Police Complaints Authority, established in 1985, to attempt to restore public confidence in the police. The sus law was repealed on 27 August 1981, when the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 received Royal Assent.section 8, Criminal Attempts Act 1981, by section 11 (commencement), one month after date of assent Triggers While there were common root causes, the triggers of the riots were different. =Brixton= On the evening of 10 April, at around 17:15, a black youth was stabbed by three other black youths in an attack seen by a police patrol in Atlantic Road. As he was being helped, a large hostile crowd gathered. As the police tried to take him to a waiting car on Railton Road, the crowd intervened. The police were attacked and the struggle only ended when more police officers arrived; the youth was taken to a hospital. The crowd is reported to have believed that the police stopped and questioned the stabbed youth, rather than help him. Rumours spread that the youth had been left to die by the police or that the police looked on as the stabbed youth was lying on the street. Over 200 youths reportedly turned on the police. In response the police decided to increase the number of police foot patrols in Railton Road, despite the tensions, and continue \\"Operation Swamp 81\\" throughout the night of Friday the 10th and into the following day, Saturday the 11th of April. During the disturbances, 299 police were injured, and at least 65 civilians. 61 private vehicles and 56 police vehicles were damaged or destroyed. 28 premises were burned and another 117 damaged and looted. 82 arrests were made.Brixton Riots, 1981 (MPS), accessed 6 March 2009. Reports suggested that up to 5,000 people were involved in the riot.The Guardian ‚Äî How smouldering tension erupted to set Brixton aflame, 13 April 1981. =Handsworth= The first riot in Handsworth took place on 10 July 1981. A second riot, which would prove more serious, took place in the area four years later. The riots were reportedly sparked by the arrest of a man near the Acapulco Cafe, Lozells and a police raid on the Villa Cross public house in the same area. Hundreds of people attacked police and property, looting and smashing, even setting off fire bombs. =Chapeltown= The exact trigger for the riots is unclear, although much speculation took place in the local and national press. By 1981, Chapeltown was experiencing a high level of violent crime, tensions were high, particularly amongst the area's Caribbean majority. The high crime brought about a police purge and the riots took place in July 1981. =Toxteth= The Merseyside police force had, at the time, a poor reputation within the black community for stopping and searching young black men in the area, under the \\"sus\\" laws, and the perceived heavy-handed arrest of Leroy Alphonse Cooper on Friday 3 July, watched by an angry crowd, led to a disturbance in which three policemen were injured. By 1981, Liverpool had one of the highest unemployment rates in Britain, with Toxteth having one of the city's highest unemployment rates. =Moss SideOther riots= There was also rioting during 1981 in a number of other English cities and towns, although most of these riots were less serious and attracted less media attention than the highly publicised rioting in areas like Brixton and Toxteth. Rioting also occurred in the Dingle, Liverpool, and the Cantril Farm district of Liverpool, although neither of these riots were as serious as the Toxeth riots. Brixton was not the only part of London to be affected by rioting. Disturbances in the districts of Southall and Battersea resulted in fire stations being targeted by rioters and ultimately evacuated for the safety of staff. There was also rioting in Ellesmere Port, Wolverhampton, Nottingham and parts of Tyneside and Humberside. Several of these areas were already known for racial tension and most of them had high levels of unemployment.

The streams flowing north from the forest are known as brooks - those east of Colgate eventually form the River Mole while those west of Colgate flow into Chennells Brook to join those flowing south (called gills) and together form the River Arun. The latter have cut down exposing bedrock in places. The Forest Ridge east of Colgate is therefore the watershed between the River Thames and the South Coast. The southern edge of the forest drains into the River Adur, and the Ouse drains the south-eastern corner. Forest Road runs along the top of the anticline, the beds dipping to the north and south at Pease Pottage, to the north west and South West at Colgate, to the west at Horsham and further west the sandstone is covered by the Weald clay. The most western point is at the A24 Broadbridge Heath Roundabout so Horsham is within the forest geologically speaking. The northern boundary is very distinct, the Holmbush Fault which has a throw of some 30 metres runs from Warnham Mill through Faygate Roundabout on the A264, along the northern edge of Douster and Broadfield Ponds and is best seen immediately north of the top carpark in Tilgate Park. It is marked by a sudden increase in slope when travelling north to south. The southern edge is much more complicated with a large number of faults and folds, but approximates to the A272. The geology continues east into Tilgate and Worth Forests. The geology consists of beds of sandstones, siltstones and clays, often with a high iron content, called the Tunbridge Wells Sand Formation which are at the top of the Hastings Beds, the lower part of the Wealden Group. Although mainly sandstones and siltstones there are several layers of clay revealed by muddy sections on the paths and tracks. There are few exposures except in the beds of the streams. The fields are mainly on the sandstones. Those with a constant slope are locally called plains (Shelley Plain and Plummers Plain for example). There are three named sandstones along the ridge, each about three metres thick, but sometimes split by a bed of clay. The lowest is the Shelley Plain sandstone, above that the Colgate sandstone forms the crest of the anticline in Colgate and Pease Pottage. The highest bed is the Roffey Park sandstone which forms the top of Blackhill. Further south a particularly strong sandstone bed is known as Tilgate Stone, but this term has also been used for the whole formation. It was frequently quarried for buildings. A thinly bedded layer is known as Horsham Stone, being quarried to the SW of Horsham, and was used for pavements and roofs. In some examples it has a corrugated surface of ripple marks. Although at a lower altitude it is part of the Wealden Clay formation, deposited later than the Hastings Beds, and is exposed in the forest between the Sidnye Farm and Borde Hill faults SE of Lower Beeding, and between Crabtree and Cowfold, again due to faulting. The beds in the western part of the forest have sufficient iron to have been worth mining ‚Äì clays, silts and sandstones were all mined. These rocks were laid down in an early Cretaceous floodplain of either a braided or meandering river whose source was in the high ground of Londinia to the north east. The clays indicate rising sea levels turned the flood plain into a coastal lagoon at times. Several thousand feet of Weald clay, greensands and chalk have been eroded from the top of the anticline. The main source for the above is The Horsham Memoir.Geological Succession in the Horsham District HMSO 1993 HistoryEarly history= The forest was part of the large wooded area now known as the Weald which extended from Hampshire east to the sea between Eastbourne and Dover, and bounded by the North and South Downs which are formed of chalk and hence have a very different vegetation. The Weald was mainly impenetrable, but vegetation must have been thinner on the poor sandy beds that top the forest ridge because Mesolithic people created a trackway along the top and have left tumuli and worked flints along its route. The forest was opened up to a limited extent by the South Saxons pushing north from the South Coast, and the Middle Saxons south from the North Downs. However, the boundary between the two was not along the watershed, but along the Clay Ridge to the north (the Surrey/Sussex border). =St. Leonard of Limousin= The forest's name is believed to have come from St Leonard (AD c485-559), a Frankish nobleman who was baptised at the court of King Clovis in 498 by St Remigius, Bishop of Rheims, and then settled for a religious life. St. Leonard's prayers ensured the safe delivery of Clovis's child, and he was given as a reward as much land as he could ride round on a donkey in a day. He established a monastery on this land at Noblac near Limoges, and became its abbot. In his old age he became a forest hermit. Noblac became a place of pilgrimage and was visited by crusaders including Richard Coeur de Lion, and it may be that this is how the story came to the south of England where some one hundred churches are named after the saint. However, local legend says that St. Leonard's hermitage was in this forest although this seems extremely unlikely. The tithes for the forest were granted to Sele Priory in Upper Beeding and St. Leonard was regarded by the Benedictines who built a hermitage dedicated to him in the forest although the site is unknown. This may be the same place as the Chapel of St. Leonard built by the Braoses of Bramber Castle. =The dragons= There is also a legend of St. Leonard the Dragon Slayer who lived in the forest and slew the last dragon in England. √Üthelweard's Chronicle of 770AD mentions \\"Monstrous serpents were seen in the country of the Southern Angles that is called Sussex\\". St. Leonard was injured and Lilies of the Valley grow where his blood fell - an area of the forest is still called The Lily Beds. As a reward he requested that snakes be banished and the nightingales which interrupted his prayers should be silenced. However, dragons were still around in August 1614 as a pamphlet was published with the title \\"Discourse relating a strange and monstrous Serpent (or Dragon) lately discovered, and yet living, to the great Annoyance and divers Slaughters both of Men and Cattell, by his strong and violent Poyson. In Sussex, two miles from Horsam, in a Woode called St. Leonards Forrest, and thirtie miles from London, this present month of August, 1614\\". Today the only dragons are the public house at Colgate or the 2001 bronze dragon statue in Horsham Park. =The Middle Ages= In 1086 the Sauvage family held Sedgwick Park on the west of the forest, and it was subsequently held by the Braoses of Bramber Castle who were given a licence to crenellate Sedgwick Castle in 1258. At this time the main use of the forest was pannage with the lords of Bramber and Bewbush holding the rights. The tithes of pannage and herbage were given to Sele Priory in 1235. The forest also had wild horses, and this may be the origins of the name Horsham which dates back to the 10th century. A horse fair was held on St Leonard's Day in the 15th century. Deer and timber belonged to the lord. Timber from the forest was sent to Dover in 1214 for use in the new great hall. Oak was given to the Bishop of Chichester in 1234 for the cathedral. Sele Priory had the rights to the underwood in 1234 - this was used to produce charcoal, hence the name Colgate (a charcoal burner was known as a collier). In 1295 the forest contained deer, hares, rabbits, pheasants and herons. Later the forest was surrounded by a pale or fence and was technically a chase rather than a forest (used for hunting but not under forest law). There were gates into the forest, some of whose names still remain - Faygate in the north, Monk's Gate in the south west and Pease Pottage Gate (the gate was dropped from the name in 1877) in the east. Other gates were between subdivisions within the forest such as Colgate. Some names refer to clearings - Doomsday Green and Mannings Heath for example. Little is known of the forest apart from legal records until the building of the hermitage or chapel, by which time it was known as Lower Beeding - Lower meaning inferior or new. The forest was larger than the modern parish, effectively the part of the Rape of Bramber in the High Weald including Rusper, Ifield, the eastern part of modern Horsham and Nuthurst. The eastern boundary was the border of the Rape of Bramber, to the east of which it became Worth Forest in the Rape of Lewes although today there is not a clear boundary between the two. The Hundred of Burbeach consisted of Upper Beeding in the south and Lower Beeding and Ifield in the north and the whole of this northern part was known as St Leonards, but it extended further to the west. The first large scale map of Sussex by Saxton in 1575 shows Crawley and Slaugham churches, The Forest of St Leonard's extending north to nearly the Surrey border, and Word Forest, but just white space between them. Speed's map of 1610 (surveyed by John Nordon about 1595) also shows three enclosed parks - St. Leonard's, Schelley and Bewbush, with the Rape border and Tylgate Forest on the east. Neither map shows any roads. =16th century= In the 16th century the forest was divided into bailiwicks - Roffey, Bewbush, Alkynburne (Hawksbourne), Horningbrook, Hyde, Shelley, Whitebarrow, Thrustlehole, Herony, Gosden and Patchgate, many of which are still recognisable today. It was around this time that the forest started to be cleared, wood being used for barrels, buildings and charcoal, the latter being used for both iron production and by the townsfolk of Horsham. In 1553 it was reported that there were no deer or other game in the forest. By the end of the century there were some 40 farms in the forest. These were not very successful except in Bewbush because of the poor soil. It is not known when ironworking started in the forest, but it was well established by the middle of the century. It is known that the Romans worked iron nearby at Crawley, and there may have been workings earlier than the 16th century, but there are no remains or records, except for a thousand horseshoes produced at a forge at Roffey in 1327. The most obvious remains today are Hawkins Pond and Hammer Pond on the sources of the Arun, the dams of which are used by Hammerpond Road to cross the deep gills. There was a blast furnace at Bewbush which produced pig iron, and this was converted to wrought iron by the finery forges below the two ponds. The water was required to drive a waterwheel which in turn raised the trip hammers. Around 1584 a blast furnace was built at Hammer Pond to process ore from near Colgate, up to a 1000 loads of ore per year. Another furnace was built at Crabtree in about 1580, the ore coming from Minepits Wood, and 49 miners were employed in 1587. There were also furnaces at Slaugham which obtained their ore from the forest - Furnace Pond is in both Slaugham and Lower Beeding. The main iron products were cannon and firebacks. Graveslabs are also found in some churches. Iron production in the area finished about 1650 when the iron works were destroyed by a parliamentary force. The iron industry was not solely responsible for the loss of the woods because although a few large timbers were used for buildings and machinery, the main requirement was for charcoal which was produced initially from the undertimber and later by coppicing. =17th century= The Crown had the rights to the timber in 1602 and during the first half of the century much of the large timber had been used for shipbuilding. Other timber was used for charcoal, and by the middle of the century large areas had been cleared, especially Bewbush and Shelley Plain. Cattle, sheep and rabbits prevented regrowth and these two areas remained arable. Elsewhere the forest degenerated into heathland, although there were intermittent attempts to farm it. =18th century= Rabbits were the main produce of the forest. The first warrens are mentioned in 1614. At the beginning of the 18th century there were five including the Great Warren to the south of Colgate, Plummers Plain and Sibballs (now known as Holmbush). By the end of the century the latter had some twelve thousand rabbits, London being the main market. The forest was described as bleak and barren as the Cumberland and Yorkshire moorland, and William Cobbett who travelled from Pease Pottage to Horsham in 1823 described it as \\"six of the worst miles in England...The first two of these miserable miles go through the estate of Lord ERSKINE [Lord Chancellor]. It was a bare heath here and there, in the better parts of it, some scrubby birch. It has been, in part, planted with fir-trees, which are as ugly as the heath was; and, in short, it is a most villainous track\\". However Michael Mills planted a straight avenue of trees around 1720, and although these were blown down in 1836, the line of the avenue remains as a long narrow clearing (legend says that Mick Mills raced the devil and won - he went so fast that he burnt the trees on either side and they would never regrow). =19th century= Much of the heathland was converted into pasture, but trees, mainly larch, fir, oak, sweet chestnut and spruce, were also planted, mainly in the large estates such as Holmbush, Bewbush and Buchan Hill. Exotic gardens containing magnolias, rhododendrons etc. were developed in the second half of the century, Leonardslee and South Lodge being two well known examples. New dams were built to create lakes for ornamentation at Leonardslee, fishing and boating at Buchan Hill. A tower 106 feet high was built at Holmbush, hence the name Tower Road which replaced Beacon Hill which gives an indication of its former use, probably in Napoleonic times. =20th century= The main change in the 20th century as far as vegetation was concerned was the spread of rhododendron throughout the forest except where the dense planting by the Forestry Commission prevented it growing. The proportion of heathland diminished except where it was deliberately preserved, as in Buchan Country Park. The opening of this park and also Owlbeech and Leechpool Woods near Horsham took place in the second half of the century and these together with the Forestry Commission land afford public access to parts of the forest. Building has increased throughout the forest although it is now an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Two large golf courses were constructed at Mannings Heath and Buchan Hill. Both have 36 holes, and the first at Mannings Heath dates back to 1905. Buchan Hill is post second world war. =21st century= There is a campaign to reduce the area covered by rhododendron - unfortunately the more it is cut back the more it regrows. The value of the Forestry Commission trees has dropped to the point where it is hardly economic to fell them. The proportion of native woodland will be increased over the next thirty years. Popular culture In The Dragon's Eye, Part 1 of The Dragonology Chronicles, St. Leonard's Forest is where many dragons live. St Leonard's Forest and its dragons also features in the Hellboy story The Nature of The Beast. In Episode 4 of BBC's Elizabeth R, Horrible Conspiracies, Mary, Queen of Scots complaining of her captivity, mentions Saint Leonard's forest as a \\"wood where nightingales never sing,\\" because \\"some unseen evil drives them away\\".

Mission  EU INTCEN's mission is to provide intelligence analysis, early warning and situational awareness to the EU High Representative and to the European External Action Service, to the various EU decision making bodies in the fields of the Common Security and Foreign Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy and Counter- Terrorism, as well as to the EU Member States. EU INTCEN does this by monitoring and assessing international events, focusing particularly on sensitive geographical areas, terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and other global threats.  History  The EU INTCEN has its roots in the European Security and Defence Policy of 1999, which put a group of analysts working on open source intelligence under the supervision of the High Representative Javier Solana in what was then called the Joint Situation Centre. In the wake of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington of 11 September 2001, Solana decided to use the existing Joint Situation Centre to start producing intelligence based classified assessments.What could be called the \\"foundational act\\" of SITCEN was signed by Javier Solana on 15 November 2001. In 2002, the Joint Situation Centre started to be a forum for exchange of sensitive information between the external intelligence services of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. At that time, the Centre's mission was: * Contribute to early warning (in conjunction with other Council military staff). Sources: open source material, military intelligence, non-military intelligence and diplomatic reporting; * Conduct situation monitoring and assessment; * Provide facilities for crisis task force; and * To provide an operational point of contact for the High Representative. At the request of Solana, the Council of the European Union agreed in June 2004 to establish within SITCEN a Counter Terrorist Cell. This Cell was tasked to produce Counter Terrorist intelligence analyses with the support of Member States' Security Services. Since 2005, the SITCEN generally used the name EU Situation Centre.See, for example, In 2012, it was officially renamed European Union Intelligence Analysis Centre (EU INTCEN). It assumed its current name in 2015. Since January 2011, the EU INTCEN is part of the European External Action Service (EEAS)http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/sede/dv/sede041011cvsalmi_/sede041011cvsalmi_en.pdf under the authority of the EU's High Representative.

As the C-47 descended for landing, it crashed near Sarakawa.Packer, George. The Village of Waiting. Macmillan, 2001, pg. 104. Eyad√©ma survived, but claimed his French pilot and all three other passengers died.Sundkler, Bengt. A History of the church in Africa. Cambridge University Press, 2000, pg. 938. Eyad√©ma claimed the aircraft had been sabotaged after he had reneged on an agreement with a French company over the use of a phosphate mine. Eyad√©ma attributed his survival to mystical powers and declared 24 January to be \\"Economic Liberation Day.\\" Eyad√©ma even changed his first name from √âtienne to Gnassingb√© to remember the date of the day he survived the crash. Following the incident, a monument was established by the Togolese government near the crash site. The monument features a statue of Eyad√©ma standing on a plinth, flanked by images of his generals who died in the crash. Eyad√©ma was not the sole survivor of the crash, but he deliberately misrepresented the details of the accident to make himself look like a hero with superhuman strength who miraculously survived the disaster when everyone else was killed. Eyad√©ma claimed that the crash was not an accident but was a conspiracy to kill him, plotted by French imperialists who did not like his plan (announced on 10 January 1974) to nationalize Brock Opperman (CTMB or Cotomib). His C-47 was replaced by a new presidential jet, a Gulfstream II (registered as 5V-TAA) which was itself damaged beyond repair in a crash on 26 December of the same year, which killed three members of the crew, but which all three of the passengers on board survived. Eyad√©ma was not on board the jet at the time.

It was broadcast by the transmitter \\"Sender Bisamberg\\", on the frequency 1476 on medium wave, hence the name of the station. To extend to the programming offer, different program elements of √ñ1 were used, as well as some productions made by the ORF.  History  In 1933, a transmitter with a 100 kW performance was put in operation and was blown up in 1945, at the end of the Second World War by SS troops. In 1950 a provisional transmitter was built with a performance of 35 kW and only 9 years later, in 1959, the new radio station was went on air with four 120 kW transmitters, which expanded in 1975 with another 600 kW transmitter. After the end of the Cold War ORF ended medium wave broadcasts. Only two years later, in 1997, the radio station was restarted with the name \\"Radio 1476\\" using the same four old 120 kW-transmitters, but reduced power of just 60 kW. For the \\"Nachbar in Not\\" campaign, the 600 kW transmitter was turned on again. In 2000, the old 120 kW transmitters were replaced by a brand-new 100 kW transistor transmitter. On January 1, 2009, \\"Radio 1476\\" was closed, after 12 years of broadcasting. It was replaced by oe1campus, a web- only station. Programming When Radio 1476 was launched in 1997, the program consisted mostly of elements from √ñ1 and other radio stations. From May 3, 1999, the radio was very engaged with Nachbar in Not, a charity project for the Balkan area. After the re-commissioning of the 600 kW transmitter, it was possible to send information to the conflict areas in Yugoslavia, which were affected by the war.

Combined with the City Engineer position, which was held by Sir Herbert Manzoni, the City Architect designed or had an important say in all city council building projects. The position was created in the 1950s by the Public Works department to assist the design and construction of large building projects that were prompted by the demands of the growing population and by the vast amounts of money being invested into regenerating areas that had been devastated by the Luftwaffe in the Birmingham Blitz. In the 1950s, Birmingham was suffering from a housing shortage for approximately 65,000 families and the council's initial attitude was to construct temporary prefabricated homes. However, as demand for longer-lasting flats grew, the council decided that it these were necessary and that the five redevelopment areas, designated by Manzoni, were to be the key foci for modern housing provision. 1952‚Äì63: Alwyn Sheppard Fidler The first architect to be given the position of City Architect of Birmingham was Alwyn Sheppard Fidler, who moved from the chief architect for the new town of Crawley in 1952. In 1954, Fidler established his own Architect's Department as the work load increased. His initial commissions were small-scale projects such as the former Register Office on Broad Street, although he was given the opportunity to exhibit his preference towards mixed- use provision ‚Äì usually a combination of residential properties and retail units. He also advocated the approach by the council towards high-density housing. In his first few years of being City Architect, Fidler witnessed the construction of many five and six story residential schemes designed by Manzoni such as the Marston Green estate. Fidler expressed his distate towards the designs of these estates, calling Manzoni's designs 'mud pies'. When Fidler created the Architect's Department, he was able to enforce three policies that would change the quality of housing design. Firstly, he ensured that he was responsible for all the housing projects that were being built by national contractors such as Wimpey that the city council was working with. Secondly, he ended the construction of Manzoni's six storey blocks and replaced them with schemes that were more specific towards the individual site and reflected for the need for the type of housing in the area. Finally, he called for the appointment of a landscape architect to improve the layout of large housing estate, a policy that surprised many Birmingham councillors. These policies did take time to come into effect as many of his designs were still affected by external forces and practices. Under Manzoni, the designs for housing blocks had been negotiated with the contractors to bring down construction costs and times. But the formation of his own department that gave him independence from Manzoni made it easier for Fidler to have a free hand in design. The change in the quality of design was almost immediate with Fidler's designs for suburban flats in Rubery and the Hankley Farm estate being selected for an exhibition at the Royal Academy and also being published by the Review in 1954 for its annual Preview. The designs consisted of six storey blocks built of load-bearing brickwork. The brickwork was used for both the exterior and the thin infill walls. The first tower blocks to be constructed by the council was the construction of four tower blocks in Duddeston. Collectively known as the Duddeston Four, the 12-storey High, Queens, Home and South Towers, were all completed between 1954 and 1955 to a design by S. N. Cooke and Partners. The design was expensive and upon their completion, they were criticised by the council over their cost, despite receiving positive reviews from the Municipal Journal and Architectural Review. These would be the last privately designed high-density residential properties constructed by the council. As well as designing residential schemes, Fidler also collaborated with private architect's firms to produce designs for schemes such as Hall Green Technology College, designed in association with S. T. Walker and Partners and completed in 1958. The use of reinforced concrete, cedar boards and aluminium frames for windows and the lack of brickwork showed how much influence S. T. Walker and Partners had on the design. Another educational building designed by Fidler is Ladywood County Primary School in 1961. Part of the City Architect's work involved conservation and repairing buildings which had been damaged in World War II. An example of this is the reconstructed Edmund Street elevation above the entrance to Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery in 1958. A project that Fidler became involved with was the Civic Centre scheme which had started just before World War II and resulted in the partially completed Baskerville House. In 1958, he produced a less formal layout with four residential tower blocks linked municipal offices on their north side. Whilst this was never constructed in his time as City Architect, it was generally approved and modified by the successor to Fidler. At the turn of the 1960s, the council began to propose and construct larger and more dramatic schemes. Manzoni's lack of experience in high-rise schemes led to Fidler being commissioned to design these more ambitious schemes. The Lyndhurst estate in Erdington was completed in 1960 to a design by Fidler and featured five tower blocks, including Harlech Tower which was the tallest tower block in the city upon completion. In the following year, the entire estate won a Civic Design Award reflecting the quality of the design and the use of materials. Whilst there had been opposition towards the demolition of the upmarket Victorian villas that were demolished to allow for the construction of the estate, much praise was given towards the masterplan which incorporated the existing mature trees. However, the council's increasing demand for more housing estates led to a lesser focus over quality of design. Fidler was a supporter of a phased approach to development, unlike the council who wanted schemes to be built all at once. In 1962, at a time when more homes were being demolished than being constructed by the council, Fidler urged the council to adopt the French Camus system which consisted of housing at a density of approximately 50 houses per hectare and 80 people per acre. The council refused this and demanded 48 homes per hectare with 75 people per acre. In 1963, following the rejection of his plan of a 'garden city' for the Castle Vale estate, Fidler resigned from his position. One of his final works was the expansion of the College of Advanced Technology (now Aston University) which was carried out in phases between 1957 and 1965. He was quickly succeeded by J. R. Sheridan-Shedden, the deputy City Architect who held the position temporarily. Upon taking the position, he designed a revised masterplan for the Castle Vale estate. The new masterplan used the Radburn Layout which consisted of super-blocks of housing, schools, retail and offices around a communal open space, a concept which was created by Clarence Stein in Radburn, New Jersey in 1929. The council attempted to limit the damage caused to their reputation as a result of the scandal surrounding the resignation of Fidler by embarking on a major building project at Castle Vale with five new goals. They increased housing output at the estate by an extra 4,000 homes, aimed to reduce the cost of dwellings, introducing industrialised forms of construction to save labour, attracting new national contractors to work in Birmingham, and increase capacity by providing continuous work for contractors. Between 1968 and 1969, 30,000 had been constructed on the estate and the council boasted a 'world record'. Despite the vast increase in housing output since Fidler, the quality of design had deteriorated. Reinforced concrete became the main material used due to its low cost and ease of use. Following Fidler's departure, the council removed some of the power that the City Architect had in housing decisions. They also sought a new architect that shared their attitude towards construction. 1966‚Äì73: Alan Maudsley The council gained a reputation for large ambitious schemes as a result of the Castle Vale estate. The council even extended out of its own boundaries to take over and construct the Water Orton estate, which is now known as Chelmsley Wood. Alan Maudsley was a supporter of the council's plans for Castle Vale and introduced Bryants, a contractor, to the council and a relationship between the two ensued. Bryant was intent on creating a brand image through the construction of homes for councils and Birmingham City Council gave them this opportunity. Due to the reduced powers the city architect had over housing design, Bryant had an influential say in housing designs. They won two-thirds of high-rise housing contracts in the city, mainly due to their use of the Bison design system. One of their largest contracts was for the Druids Heath estate in the south of Birmingham which the company boasted would be \\"the largest industrialised building project in Britain\\". The main reason for Bryants' success in Birmingham was their adoption of the Bison method of industrialised system building. The relationship between the council and Bryants was aided by an ex- Birmingham councillor and West Midlands MP who handled the firm's publicity. His influence in the company assisted them in awarding contracts in other Labour-controlled areas in the Black Country. To aid their position in securing contracts in Birmingham and the Black Country, Bryants gave gifts to senior members of the councils. The process in awarding contracts became less and less transparent. However, in November 1973, Alan Maudsley along with private architects John Sharp and Evan Ebery were arrested and charged with corruption relating to the awarding of contracts to Bryants. The two private architects were also arrested for corruptly conspiring to give money towards paying transport costs, hotel bills and the provision of a London flat for Maudsley. Alan Maudsley pleaded guilty to entering a corrupt relationship with Sharp and Ebery at Birmingham Crown Court in 1975. In 1977, four Bryants directors were guilty on numerous counts of giving gifts to councillors. In 1978, Christoper Bryant, the owner of Bryants, went on trial at the Old Bailey denying two counts of plotting to bribe Maudsley. Despite this, Maudsley did produce some designs for the city council. His focus was more towards public facilities, in a period when housing output was reaching its peak in Birmingham. Examples of facilities he designed or assisted in the design of include the Cannon Hill Park Boat House in 1967, which was designed in association with Edward L. Preston. The same two architects worked together to design the Perry Barr Refuse Disposal Works in 1969, although the design was changed significantly, including the removal of a tall chimney. Although the design for Birmingham Central Library is largely accredited to John Madin, a prolific local architect, Alan Maudsley played a vital part in the design of the building. His changes to the original design by Madin to reduce costs are said to be the main causes for the problems that the structure is now experiencing, for example the decision to construct it out of pre-cast concrete panels as opposed to Travertine marble which had been suggested by Madin. Conservation projects were also part of Maudsley's work load and in 1969 he designed the renovation of the Kingston Row terraced houses which date back to 1780. Maudsley still assisted in the design of major housing projects, such as Bromford Bridge in the Bromford area of Erdington. The housing estate housed approximately 6,000 people when opened in 1968 with numerous high-rise tower blocks and low-rise blocks set alongside the M6 motorway. Maudsley also designed and masterplanned an estate of 64 single storey houses on Kingstanding Beacon in the Kingstanding area. W.G. Reed ‚Äì the last City Architect While Maudsley was being prosecuted, his deputy William G. Reed fulfilled the role of City Architect, and following Maudsley's conviction he was appointed City Architect. The quantity surveying division was separated into the new City Building Finance Department. Reed sought to improve both the quality of architectural design, and the methods of managing the department. The post of Deputy was abolished and four Assistant City Architects each headed major areas of work: Housing; Education and Social Services. He appointed Granville Lewis, formerly at Coventry City Council, as Assistant City Architect responsible for a new wave of social housing estates on the City's Worcestershire border. Reed also appointed a number of new generation architects to introduce fresh design ideas. The resulting North Worcestershire estates broke new ground in layout and dwelling design being more open and attractive than their predecessors. In the early 1970s a backlash developed to post-war wholesale slum clearance. It became recognised that dwellings scheduled for clearance could be refurbished to provide decent homes. Birmingham, at the forefront of this new thinking, established an Urban Renewal section in the Environmental Health Department. This based 8 multi- disciplinary project teams around the city working with residents on the improvement of their neighbourhoods. In a far-sighted and progressive move, Reed established project team architects in each team with a dedicated central group of architectural staff under architect Ken Gething, who had joined the Department following the merger of Sutton Coldfield into Birmingham. Reed also appointed a project planner to assist in clarifying the sequence and timescale of the work. The result was a major contribution to Birmingham‚Äôs national pre- eminence in the urban renewal field. Meanwhile, the programme of new social housing that had been the core of the department‚Äôs role was reducing year by year, and Reed was faced with the delicate task of reducing the size of the department and adapting it to a different mix of work, and this remained a constant challenge throughout his tenure. A further challenge arose when the Chief Executive, Tom Caulcott, launched a consultant‚Äôs review of the department to establish its viability and benefit to the city. After an intensive investigation by Coopers & Lybrand, the conclusion was that the department, though capable of improvement, was indeed a viable operation. Reed had long supported the use of information technology and one outcome of the investigation together with the emergence of affordable mini and PC computers was the introduction of better project financial systems and the progressive roll out of computer aided design. Throughout, Reed‚Äôs dedication to design and designers never wavered and led to a National RIBA Architecture Award in 1987 for social housing in Belgrave Middleway, and RIBA President‚Äôs Building of the Year in 1989 for Nelson Mandela School, both by Reed appointee Will Howland. Reed had to manage the process of selecting the architects for the Birmingham International Convention Centre and Symphony Hall, requiring great tact in balancing the competing interests of local, national and international companies. In the 1990 New Years Honours list Reed was appointed CBE for services to architecture. In 1991 the Departments of Planning and Architecture were merged and Les Sparks formerly Director of Planning at Bath headed the new organisation, with Reed as Associate Director of Planning and Architecture. The following year he retired, and the title City Architect was discontinued Heads of Architecture The role of City Architect was jointly fulfilled by Pat Eve, formerly the Practice Architect and Ken Gething. Following the merger of the building structural and M&E; engineering functions, the combination became Birmingham Design Services. When Eve and Gething retired, Will Howland headed the organisation until 1997, and Trevor Skempton was then appointed, leaving in 2000. A further merger subsequently took place with the council‚Äôs building maintenance division, and the once prestigious and influential department effectively ceased to exist.

It is endemic to Sonoma County, California, where it is known only from The Cedars, an unincorporated area outside Guerneville north of Cazadero, just west of Austin Creek State Recreation Area. The species is named for botanist Roger Raiche, who collected it in flower in 1982 and it was published by Farwig & Girard as a distinct new species in 1987.McConahey, M. Enchanted Canyon.The Press Democrat May 8, 2003. It is limited to the ultramafic rock (serpentine soil) at the headwaters of Big Austin and East Austin Creeks which are part of the Russian River watershed. In the East Austin headwaters, it is not only in The Cedars, but extends SE in a contiguous band of ultramafic rock that crosses parts of Murray, Devil, Thompson, Morrison and Gilliam Creeks where it occurs on the flanking slopes. It also occurs in Grasshopper, Danfield, Cedar and House Creeks, which are part of the Wheatfield Fork of the Gualala River watershed. Description Calochortus raichei is a perennial herb from a membranous coated bulb, producing a stem which is typically 2 - 5 dm tall, but can reach 1 meter tall in some years. The gray basal leaf is up to 40 centimeters long, typically withered at flowering; there may be smaller leaves farther up the stem. The herbage of the plant is generally very waxy in texture. The inflorescence typically bears only one or two nodding flowers as the side branches usually do not develop, but in favored sites the side branches may produce additional flowers (3 - 12), spherical in shape with their petal tips touching. The three sepals are about 2 centimeters long and dull tan to greenish, and the three petals about 4 centimeters in length and yellow,. Both sepals and petals age to orange-bronze. The petals are coated inside and fringed with hairs.

Staprans was born in 1926 in Riga, Latvia. He now lives in San Francisco, California with his wife, scientist Ilona StaprƒÅns. He has two daughters, Maretta StaprƒÅns-Barlow and Alda StaprƒÅns-Mednis. After living in occupied Latvia and in a Displaced Persons camp during World War II, Staprans immigrated to the United States with his family in 1947. He studied art at the University of Washington under Alexander Archipenko and Mark Tobey, then moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to begin graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. He studied with Hans Hofmann and Karl Kasten, among others, and graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts in 1954. Staprans began exhibiting his art in the Maxwell Galleries in San Francisco. He currently exhibits at the Hackett  Mill Gallery in San Francisco and at the Peter Mendenhall Gallery in Los Angeles. Staprans' work is held in the permanent collections in the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the San Jose Museum of Art, and the Portland Art Museum, among others. A career retrospective of his art opened at the Pasadena Museum of California Art in March, 2006, was shown at the Hackett-Freedman Gallery and traveled to Riga, Latvia where it was exhibited in the Latvian National Museum of Art later that year. A 60-year retrospective exhibit entitled \\"Full Spectrum: Paintings by Raimonds Staprans,\\" opened in June, 2017 at the Crocker Art Museumhttps://www.crockerart.org/exhibitions/full-spectrum in Sacramento, California and then moved to the San Jose Museum of Art in San Jose, California in February, 2018. Staprans' skillfully constructed still life and landscape paintings are notable for the artist's sensitive response to light and color. A recent review of his work exhibited in Los Angeles compared the \\"tasteful seriousness\\" of his paintings to that of C√©zanne. Staprans is said to examine the \\"architecture\\" of everyday objects in his art using explosive color and flattened compositions, creating a \\"tension between representation and abstraction that plays with viewers' expectations.\\" Staprans is also an accomplished playwright. Most of his plays are set in Latvia during the 20th century. His play \\"The Freezing\\" was produced in 1979 by the San Francisco Little Theater and the Latvian National Theater in 1980. His 1989 play, \\"Four Days in June\\", depicted the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940. It was performed in Riga to more than 100 sold-out audiences, and later won first prize in the Baltic Theatre Festival. \\"Four Days in June\\" is regarded as having played an integral part in the pro-democracy movement in Latvia during the momentous changes following the end of the Soviet Union. In 2003, Staprans was awarded Latvia's highest civilian honor, the Order of the Three Stars, the Latvian equivalent of the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom. An extensive interview with Raimonds Staprans was conducted by the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, by Paul Karlstrom in 1997. Karlstrom later published a fully illustrated book entitled \\"Raimonds Staprans: Art of Tranquility and Turbulence\\".  References  Further reading  *Shields, Scott A. and Pagel, David.

M. G. Le Cl√©zio. Historical Basis According to the author this is a true story about the whaler Charles Melville Scammon (1825‚Äì1911). In December 1857, Charles Scammon, in the brig Boston, along with his schooner- tender Marin, entered Laguna Ojo de Liebre (Jack-Rabbit Spring Lagoon), later known as Scammon's Lagoon, and found one of the Gray Whale's last refuges. The story resembles the tale of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, who was also on the deck of a wooden ship searching for a white whale. Pawana is about the discovery of a lagoon in Mexico at the end of the 19th century where gray whales went to reproduce. After Captain Scammon mistakenly decided to exterminate the whales, he realized that he had made a mistake so terrible it could become irreparable. Captain Scammon then set about dedicating his life's work to saving these whales (and was helped by a Mexican revolutionary in doing so). Meaning of \\"Await√© Pawana\\" \\"Await√© Pawana\\" is the cry uttered by the lookout when he spies the whales. Narrative Araceli, the old Indian slave from Nantucket tells a young cabin boy about the exploits of the Indians of the past through mime and gesture.

His mother was his first art instructor, Lou Scott Royston, who was also a well-known Texas painter. He studied under such diverse mentors as Pompeo Coppini, Texas Culptro (\\"Confederate Soldier\\", DeLeon Plaza, Victoria), J. Ferdinand McCan of Victoria, Robert Henri, Walt Kuhn, Lawton Parker, and I.R. Wilson. Nave continued to paint the landscape he was so fond of, as well as commissioned portraits. One of his most well-known, a portrait of Rebecca Fisher, the \\"Mother of Texas,\\" is in the extensive collection of the State Capitol in Austin. He had many exhibitions in New York, The National Academy, the Pennsylvania Academy and the Cargneie International Exhibition of 1919 in Pittsburgh. As an artist, he enjoyed a prolific and successful painting career both in Texas and New York, He traveled widely, painting and sketching as he went. His primary interests were people and outdoors. He loved the landscape of Texas. It was in New York that Nave became renowned for his portrait work, of which he had many one-man exhibitions. He left New York to serve in the U.S. Army in World War I, after which he traveled the western United States. He returned to New York to have several more one-man shows, and then returned to Victoria to study with his mentor J. Ferdinand McCan. It was at this time that he met and married his wife Emma. In 1931 he suffered a fatal heart attack while visiting his brother in Harlingen. In 1932, his widow Emma Nave built the Nave Museum in Victoria, Texas to exhibit his works. She commissioned San Antonio architect Atlee Ayers to design and build the Museum. At first, the museum housed the Nave paintings, and then for a while it served as the first library in Victoria, with the Nave paintings hanging above the bookshelves. When the new public library opened in 1976, the Nave became a fine arts museum. It currently hosts 5 to 6 diverse exhibits per year, featuring local, regional and state wide artists, and occasionally nationally known artists as well. The Victoria Regional Museum Association, Inc. runs the museum, and still has possession of 43 of the Nave paintings. The Nave paintings have traveled to many museums for display, and are currently being restored and will soon be on display at the Nave on a rotating basis, until a full show happens at the end of 2021.

In 1775 Steuart sailed to Scotland, deciding at age 75 that \\"he could not turn rebel in his old age\\". He remained there until his death in 1784. Early life Steuart was born in Argaty, Perthshire (now Stirling), in around 1695‚Äì1700,Papenfeuse, p.773 the second son of George Steuart and Mary Hume. His family were members of the Balquhidder Stewart clan, descendants of Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany, executed by King James I of Scotland in 1425. It is likely that Steuart spoke both Gaelic and English. According to the Old Statistical Account of 1799, Scottish Gaelic was the language of the \\"common people\\" of Balquhidder and the surrounding area, although English would have been spoken in the \\"low country\\", around Stirling. This would in fact have been the Scots language of the Stirlingshire area, rather than Standard English.\\"Parish of Balquhidder\\", Old Statistical Account of Scotland, Vol. 12, 1799. Steuart's elder brother David stood to inherit the family estates, and Steuart studied medicine, receiving his MD at the University of Edinburgh. In 1721 he emigrated to Annapolis, in the colony of Maryland, where he settled and established a medical practice.Papenfeuse, p.773American Swedish 1973, Edited by Leif Sjoberg, at p.69 Retrieved 15 January 2010 In the early 18th century Maryland was a sparsely settled, largely rural society.

His most successful horse was Dungannon, which he had brought from England to compete against the stable of his rival, Charles Carroll of Annapolis (1703‚Äì1783), whose son Charles Carroll of Carrollton would later sign the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Dungannon won the Annapolis Subscription Plate, the first recorded formal horse race in Maryland, in May 1743.Nelker, p.118 The race took place in Parole and the original silver cup is now displayed in the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Many Scots had fled to the colonies following the crushing of the Jacobite rising of 1745, and had little appetite for further rebellion. However, like other Marylanders, Steuart opposed the taxes imposed by London and in 1764 he traveled to England where he made representations to the government at Westminster. Steuart's grandson, Richard Sprigg Steuart (1797‚Äì1876), recalled in his memoirs: :\\"When he went over [to England] in 1764, to take my father [James Steuart] to school, he was commissioned by a number of Marylanders to call upon Lord North, England's new Chancellor of the Exchequer, hostile to America, on his way through London, and make representations on the subject of taxation.

However, such highly personalised attacks did little to reduce the political temperature.McWilliams, Jane W., p.68 Retrieved June 2012 =War with Great Britain= War broke out in 1775, and the fact of owning estates in both Scotland and Maryland caused Steuart considerable political difficulties. As Richard Sprigg Steuart recalled: :\\"He was an ardent admirer of the American Colonies, and believed the principles for which the colonists contended were just, and truly English. But though he sympathised with his American friends, he said he could not turn rebel in his old age, being 75 years old when the Revolution broke out...he would have forfeited [his Scottish estates] if he had joined the Revolutionists. He therefore went over to Scotland and saved his property there. He gave all his estates in Maryland to his wife [Ann], telling her by letter...how to leave the property in America, which was finally done.\\"Nelker, p.123, memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart Ann therefore remained in America despite her own Loyalist sympathies. She would never again see her husband, and she continued to live at Dodon until her death in 1814. According to Richard Sprigg Steuart: :\\"My Grandmother's family, the Digges, were at heart all Torys but kept quiet...they were called non-jurors and paid double taxes. [After the War] she lived comfortably, but she kept at home because her good husband was called by the mob a Tory, which he was not....he never while in Scotland heard of a battle that he did not express his regret and call it a fratricidal war.\\"Nelker, 128, memoirs of Richard Sprigg Steuart =Aftermath= Steuart never returned to Maryland, and he died in 1784 in Scotland, one year after the Revolutionary War ended.

Synopsis The pictures are evidence of Riefenstahl's passion for Africa and an attempt to capture the region's soul before it lost its innocence to the technical age.Leni Riefenstahl-Africa Reception The most well-known critical reaction to Riefenstahl's photography of the Nuba came from the American intellectual, Susan Sontag. Sontag scrutinized the \\"fascist aesthetics\\" of the works in her widely read essay \\"Fascinating Fascism\\". Writing in the New York Review of Books in 1975, she stated: \\"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\\". She continued \\"Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing. Sontag wrote that the collection was the \\"final, necessary step in Riefenstahl's rehabilitation. It is the final rewrite of the past; or, for her partisans, the definitive confirmation that she was always a beauty-freak rather than a horrid propagandist.\\" References Category:1982 books Category:German books Category:Sudanese culture Category:Books by Leni Riefenstahl ","title":"Vanishing Africa"},{"id":"20808862","text":"Jonas Brignoni Dos Santos (born 4 July 1983, in Ibirub√°), or simply Jonas, is a Brazilian footballer who plays as a defender.

It is a large greyish- brown snail that cannot fully retract into its shell. Description For terms see gastropod shell. The body of this semi-slug is too large to be contained in the very flat and depressed ear-shaped shell. The shell body whorl is ¬æ of the total breadth viewed from above. It is very thin, fragile and transparent. Shell colour is greenish or yellowish. The shell aperture has a mouth membrane which runs from the umbilicus along the inside of the outer lip. The animal is pale to dark grey or black, paler forms have large dark grey areas. The mantle lobe is very large. Genitalia:Penis with appendix, joins vagina below the insertion of spermatheca duct. Distribution and habitat This species is known to occur in Brittany, the French Pyrenees, Andorra, Spain and southwestern Ireland. This is called a Lusitanian distribution and was at one time thought to represent the survival of species in an ice-free land mass that served as a refugium during the last ice age. This theory has now been discredited as Ireland is thought to have been entirely covered by ice during the height of the Quaternary glaciation. It now seems likely that these species were re-introduced into Ireland after the last glaciation, probably accidentally with human migration in the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic. It typically inhabits humid and shady places, between rocks, or in Ireland in woodland amongst moist ground litter, usually on non- calcareous soils. It is not usually found in areas grazed by livestock.

Williams Term Professor (1993‚Äì1998) at the University of Pennsylvania. He is a pioneer in the field of cognitive psychology in the development of experimental techniques to study human information processing. Sternberg received a B.A. in mathematics in 1954 from Swarthmore College and a PhD in social psychology from Harvard University in 1959. He completed a postdoctoral fellowship in mathematical statistics at the University of Cambridge in 1960, and he subsequently worked as a research scientist in the linguistics and artificial intelligence research department at Bell Laboratories, where he continued to work as a member of the technical staff for over twenty years. Sternberg's first academic position was at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was employed from 1961‚Äì1964, and where he has remained since 1985. He has also served as a visiting professor at University College, London, the University of California, Berkeley, and Rutgers University. The impact of Sternberg's theoretical and empirical contributions to the field of cognitive psychology have been recognized by many organizations, and he has been elected to fellowship in the American Psychological Association, the Association for Psychological Science, the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Academy of Sciences.  Additive factors method  Sternberg is best known for his introduction of the additive factor method. This is a method that uses reaction time measures over a range of tasks in order to identify different cognitive processing stages. The logic of this method has been disputed . The Sternberg Task In the early 1960s, Sternberg published an original experiment demonstrating the mechanics of cognitive information processing. The experiment entails memorization of a positive set, a list of items such as numbers or words. The subject is then asked about a particular test item that may or may not have actually been present in the set, and is asked to respond \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" accordingly. The time taken for the subject to respond is recorded. This process is then repeated over several trials. What Sternberg found was that response time varied with the size of the positive set. In particular, response time tended to increase with the size of the list. This is significant because it demonstrates evidence for what is known today as the Serial Exhaustive Search Theory, which contends that when questioned regarding the presence of an item in a memory set, people will search every item in short-term memory without stopping, even if the item was found.

Players can play on the Hero team or as the Zombies. A modular board randomly determines the layout of the town at the start of each game and there are several different scenarios to play. Seven supplements have been released. To achieve a horror movie feel, all of the art for the game is photographic and the game comes with a CD soundtrack of original music. The game borrows from horror film stereotypes and zombie film plots. Game Contents *1 Full Color Rulebook *1 Town Center Game Board *6 L-Shaped Outer Boards *8 Unique Hero Figures (Grey) *14 Zombie Figures (7 Green, 7 Brown) *40 Card Hero Deck (Basic Game) *40 Card Zombie Deck (Basic Game) *20 Advanced Cards for the Hero Deck *20 Advanced Cards for the Zombie Deck *6 Reference Cards *8 Large Hero Character Sheets *5 Large Scenario Cards *2 Full Color sheets of Die-Cut Counters *16 Dice (12mm D6) *1 CD Soundtrack of Original Music Gameplay An example of Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game gameplay. Zombie cosplayer playing Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game at Gen Con 2007. Before playing, the board is set up. A double-sided square board, with the Town Center on one side and the Manor House on the other, is placed either side up depending on the scenario. Four L-shaped boards are then randomly chosen and placed around the center square. Players are split into two teams, the Zombies and the Heroes. Up to two Zombie players and four Hero players can play and players are split into teams differently depending on the number of players. Four Hero characters are chosen randomly by the Hero team and split amongst the players. Depending on the scenario, each Hero character has their own starting location, special rules, and number of wounds they can take before they are dead. Zombie players roll a die to determine how many Zombies are placed on the board before play. A Scenario then needs to be chosen, randomly or by vote. Each Scenario has a certain limit of turns, winning conditions, and other objectives. Each team has their own deck of cards. The Hero Deck contains Events and Items, and the Zombie Deck contains Zombie Events. Each Hero character can only hold four Items at a time, two of them being Weapons. Cards may be played at any time, unless noted on the card or after a card has caused dice to be rolled. Gameplay is split into two turns, the Zombie Turn and the Hero Turn. On the Zombie Turn, the Sun Track marker is moved to show the number of turns that have been taken so far. Zombie players then draw cards to bring their collective hand of cards up to four. They have the option of discarding one card per player at this point. Up to 14 Zombie miniatures can be in play at one time. To determine if more Zombies are spawned, two dice are rolled and if the sum is higher than the number of Zombies on the board, more Zombies are placed later in the turn. Zombies on the board are each moved up to one square on the board. Building walls do not block movement of the Zombies. If any of these moves causes a Zombie to be in a square adjacent from a Hero character, they automatically move into the same space. Any Zombie in the same square as a Hero must now fight them. A Zombie player rolls one die, but wins on a tie and the Hero player rolls two dice and uses their higher number. If the Hero wins the fight, the Zombie is \\"fended off\\" but remains in place. If a Hero rolls doubles, however, the Zombie is killed and removed from the board. Cards, such as Hand Weapons or Events may be used to change the outcome of a fight. The Zombie players now roll a die to see how many new Zombies are spawned, up to 6. When spawning Zombies they must be placed on one of the four Spawning Pits. Each L-shaped board has a single Spawning Pit. Before placing more than one Zombie on a Spawning Pit, each of the four Spawning Pits must first contain one of the newly spawned Zombies. On the Hero Turn each Hero character takes their turn separately in any character order they wish. They first move or search. To move, a die is rolled and the Hero may move up to that many spaces. Some buildings have \\"Pick Ups\\", that let the player take a specific Item out of the discard pile instead of the top of the Hero Deck. If a Hero is in the same space as another Hero, Items may be exchanged between the characters. A ranged attack may now be made if the Hero has a Ranged Weapon. Each Ranged Weapon has a specific range and die roll needed to be successful. If successful, the Zombie is killed and removed from play. The Hero must now fight any Zombies sharing their space, as described in the Zombie Turn. Once all Hero characters have completed their individual turn, the Hero Turn ends. Either team wins by completing their Scenario Objective. In addition, the Zombie team wins automatically by killing four Hero characters or causing the last card of the Hero Deck to be discarded. Depending on the Scenario, one team loses if they do not complete their Scenario Objective before the turn limit has been reached. ExpansionsGrowing Hunger (2008)= This expansion adds three new scenarios as well as a two player mini-game. It introduces new game mechanics including a modular 'Dots' system to incorporate different rules to any existing scenario.

Among its facilities are Stead Recreation Center, located at 1625 P Street NW; a lighted basketball court; an athletic field with a baseball diamond; and a playground. Public events such as Summer Movie Mania, an outdoor screening sponsored by the city's government, are held at the park. Stead Park is also used as a practice field by the Washington Renegades RFC, the first rugby union club in the United States to recruit gay men and men of color. The park and its small staff are administered by the city's Department of Parks and Recreation. Stead Park, whose property was valued at $8,659,560 in 2009, is partially funded by a private trust created by Washington architect Robert Stead (1846-1943). The park is named for Stead's wife, Mary Force Stead. History Stead Park playground, after 2008 renovation The portion of the park next to P Street once held 19th-century row houses. During a 2008 renovation, archaeological work uncovered artifacts and brick foundations from the houses that once occupied 1613 and 1625 P Street. Researchers concluded that the latter supported a house built in 1878 by Henry Hurt, a Confederate Army veteran and president of the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company. In 1951, work began on Stead Park, an explicitly unsegregated recreational facility. The single-story fuel sheds from the row houses at 1621, 1623, and 1625 were consolidated, expanded, and topped with a second story; this structure became the park's recreation center. The park was eventually completed at a cost of $80,000 ($ today), and formally opened on November 13, 1953. In 2003, plans for a four-story, multimillion-dollar gay community center to be built on a small section of the aging park sparked a dispute among Dupont Circle residents and the Washington D.C. Center for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender People. The plans were ultimately abandoned. In 2008, the recreation center and playground were renovated. Work began in April and the park reopened on December 15. ReferencesExternal links *Friends of Stead Park *2008 archaeological survey at Stead Park Category:1953 establishments in Washington, D.C.

History The four locomotives were built in 1904 by the firm of Borsig. The frame was designed as a water tank. Due to the steep inclines it had a large boiler, the boiler barrel consisting of two shells. It had an Allan valve gear with trick valves. The connecting rods drove the third coupled wheels. The loco had an Exter counterweight brake for the engine and a K√∂rting vacuum brake for the train. This was probably replaced in 1926 by a Westinghouse compressed-air brake. When the Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the operational running of the state-owned by privately operated line from the Deutsche Eisenbahn-Betriebsgesellschaft, a subsidiary of the firm of Vering & Waechter who had built the line, these engines were incorporated into their fleet as numbers 99 7201 to 99 7204. In 1964/1965 the steam locomotives were retired and replaced by diesel locomotives. Until then they had managed all the traffic, no other locomotives were even employed in a temporary role.

A Dictionary of British Place-Names Oxford University Press History The village of Titley has been occupied for over a thousand years and there is evidence of a pre- conquest priory in the village originally dedicated to an obscure Welsh saint and later subordinate to the abbey of Tiron in France. Titley lies at the junction of two drovers' roads and a local pub was, at one time, used for the weighing of wool. Buildings Titley's parish church, dedicated to Saint Peter was rebuilt in 1869. The Stagg Inn, known as The Balance until 1833, became in 2001 the first pub in the United Kingdom to be awarded a Michelin Star. Eywood House was built just west of the village in 1705. A landscaped park was laid out around the house, and an existing kettle lake, Titley Pool, was enlarged. The house was demolished in 1958. Titley Pool is now a nature reserve.

It was adapted from the 1867 stage play Le juif polonais by Erckmann- Chatrian. The 1867 play was translated into English in 1871 as The Bells by Leopold Lewis and for years was one of actor Henry Irving's most successful roles.George Rowell (1953) Nineteenth Century Plays Plot A melodramatic climax occurs when the sound of sleigh bells at his daughter's wedding (in Act II) reminds the innkeeper Mathias of the Jew he had murdered 15 years previously. Dreaming (in Act III) that he is being tried for the murder, he confesses the details of the attack and his disposal of the body, and dies of a heart attack. Performances The opera was first performed in Paris at the Op√©ra Comique on 11 April 1900, when the cast included Gustave Huberdeau, the tenor Edmond Cl√©ment as Christian and Victor Maurel as Mathias. The role of Mathias's daughter Suzelle was created by Julia Guirandon.New York Times review of the premiere, April 29, 1900 Gustav Mahler chose to present the work in Vienna in 1906, where it proved a dismal failure. The plot was found to be thin, and the music insufficient to support interest. According to Alma Mahler, her husband had been reminded, when he heard the work in Paris, of his own Fourth Symphony by the sleighbells. Viennese critics rated the work as inferior to another on the same theme by Karel Weis, produced in Vienna in 1902.La Grange (1999) pp. 485‚Äì7 Nevertheless the opera remained in the repertory in France until the 1930s.Tchamkerten, Grove Music Online Bibliography *La Grange, Henry-Louis, de.

It is a single-engined monoplane with a fixed tricycle undercarriage, conventional control stick, and is, unusually, fitted with a V-tail. Due to the large bubble canopy, visibility is excellent. Its benign flight characteristics, moderate speeds and low fuel consumption, as well as some unique details, like an engine starter button which can only be pressed when the fuel selector switch is open, made the ATL a good trainer. Development and design In the early 1980s, Avions Pierre Robin started design of an ultra-lightweight two-seat light aircraft intended to meet the requirements of French flying clubs for a low-cost light trainer, as existing American training aircraft were becoming increasingly expensive, which was not helped by an unfavourable exchange rate, which resulted in a competition to supply a new light trainer, which could be mass-produced for supply to subsidised French flying clubs. Robin won the competition in 1983 with their ATL design, a single-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage and a V-tail. The ATL's fuselage was of Glass-reinforced plastic construction, with a wooden wing, while the V-tail is a conventional all-metal construction.Blech 1985, p.26. The first prototype flew on 17 June 1983, powered by a single 35 kW (47 hp) JPX PAL 1300, a new design of two stroke, three-cylinder radial engine. However, testing showed that the new engine was prone to vibration, and in order to speed development and certification, the prototype was re-engined with a converted Volkswagen car engine,Flight International 26 November 1983, p.1418. which formed the basis for production. As the four-cylinder car engine was heavier than the original engine, the aircraft's wings were swept forward to maintain the aircraft's centre of gravity in an acceptable position. Operational history First orders, for 30 ATLs were placed by the French National Aviation Federation in November 1983, with initial deliveries starting (under a limited airworthiness approval) in April 1985. Full French certification followed on 15 January 1986. The ATL was prone to engine problems, however, which forced the recall of early production aircraft for modification, and limited the attractiveness of the aircraft, particularly for export.Donald 1997, p.775. One solution to this problem was re-engining with a more reliable engine, and Robin developed a version for the German market powered by a 52.5 kW (70 hp) Limbach. While the Limbach was also a modified VW car engine, crucially, it had dual ignition instead of the single ignition on the JPX- modified engines normally used, this being certified in 1989.Flight International 1 July 1989, p.20 This came too late, however, and production ended in 1991 after the completion of 132 aircraft, of which 10 were powered by the Limbach engine. Variants ;ATL Club :Initial production version, named Bijou in the UK. ;ATL Club Model 88 :Late production version, with smaller propellor giving greater ground clearance and more fuel. ;ATL Club Model 89 :Limbach powered version.

Life  Braulio Arenas lived most of his youth in the north of Chile, moving in his teens to Talca to study. There he encountered Te√≥filo Cid and Enrique G√≥mez Correa among others, and participated to literary activities with them. Years later, he started law studies in Santiago, which he soon abandoned to focus on writing. Through Eduardo Anguita, he met Vicente Huidobro, father of \\"Creationism\\" literary movement, which disputed literary innovations with Dada and Surrealism. Influenced by these European currents, Arenas founded with some friends, in 1938, the Surrealist group Mandr√°gora. This circle supported the Popular Front government. The same year, one of his short story, Gehenna, was published in Miguel Serrano's Antolog√≠a del verdadero cuento en Chile. Arenas received in 1984 the Chilean National Prize for Literature, winning some recognition albeit confidential editions of his works (often less than 800 exemplaries).

The club, located in Walbrzych's neighborhood of Bialy Kamien, is the most famous for its football team. History The club was founded in 1945, when former German city of Waldenburg became part of Poland. Its founders were Polish emigrees from France and Belgium, who named the club Thorez, after Maurice Thorez, a French communist leader. The name was disliked by most fans and was changed in 1968 into Zaglebie, which means coal basin in Polish, as Walbrzych was an important center of mining. In 1968, Zaglebie Walbrzych won promotion to the Ekstraklasa, and in the 1970/1971 season, it finished in the 3rd spot, after Gornik Zabrze and Legia Warszawa. Zaglebie participated in the games of the UEFA Cup, advancing to the second round. In the first round, it beat Czechoslovakian team FK Teplice (1-0, 3-2), in the second round it lost to Romanian side UT Arad (1-1, 1-2). Team's most famous player is goalkeeper Marian Szeja, participant of the 1972 Olympic Games. Logo used after fierce rivals G√≥rnik Wa≈Çbrzych and Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych were merged, a decision which several years later de facto ultimately ended Zag≈Çƒôbie's existence. After the 1974 season, Zag≈Çƒôbie was relegated from the First Division and has never returned. A difficult financial situation of sports clubs in Wa≈Çbrzych meant that in the early 1990s the club merged with fierce rivals G√≥rnik Wa≈Çbrzych much to the shock of both sets of fans after over 40 years of rivalry. The new merged club then became \\"KP Wa≈Çbrzych\\", then \\"KP G√≥rnik/Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych\\". Matches were played at Zag≈Çƒôbie's stadium but eventually the Zag≈Çƒôbie part was dropped from the name and the club de facto ceased to exist.http://rfbl.pl/feniks-odradzajacy-sie-z-popiolow/ On 6 April 2006 the \\"Stowarzyszenie GKS Zag≈Çƒôbie Wa≈Çbrzych\\", was created, reactivating the football section of the club.

The BeL also houses a biosurety-compliant, secure, state-of-the-art cold storage capability. =Forensic Analytical Center= The Forensic Analytical Center, a chemistry/biology laboratory built in 1993, allows scientists to analyze hundreds of relatively routine samples and conduct highly sophisticated chemical analysis on samples that may contain unusual materials and trace amounts of materials, including chemical and biological warfare agents for which results may be expected within hours or days. The lab and its specialized equipment are independently accredited by international organizations to ISO 9001 and ISO Guide 25/17025. Primary facilities in the Forensic Analytical Center include gas chromatographs, Fourier transform spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, ion chromatograph, capillary zone electrophoresis, nuclear magnetic resonance and bio identification. =Engineering & test facilities= Toxic Test Chambers were built 1943. Another facility was built 1971. Both hazardous material test facilities have chambers, equipped with 5000 CFM CBR filter systems with an air change approximately every three minutes maintaining the chambers under negative pressure, uniquely designed for total containment in the testing of chemical (military and industrial) related equipment, and explosive/toxic munitions/materials. Chemical warfare agents and explosives may be tested simultaneously. An onsite surety lab is equipped with GC/MS, HPLC, Dynatherm, and wet lab capabilities to perform agent analysis to RDTE drinking standards. =Prototype Detonation Test and Destruction Facility= The Prototype Detonation Test and Destruction Facility (PDTDF) is capable of testing technologies that require various site layouts. The facility is located at J-Field in the Edgewood Area of Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. The PDTDF can accommodate the heaviest of the transportable systems that are currently in use. Some previous systems that have been tested include Large Item Transportable Access and Neutralization System (LITANS), Explosive Destruction System (EDS), and the Transportable Detonation Chamber (TDC). The environmentally controlled chamber is monitored by an onsite monitoring room and has the capability of providing supplied air and decontamination services. Personal protective equipment storage and changing rooms are connected to the chamber to allow ease of egress and ingress. The PDTDF permits have been approved for up to 1 pound TNT-equivalent. However, current destructions systems located at the site have been approved for 62.5 pounds TNT-equivalent explosives. =Berger Engineering Complex= The Berger Lab Complex, built in 1989, is a multi-purpose building with professional offices, 100 seat auditorium, general purpose labs, and high bay test areas for handling combat vehicles. Berger‚Äôs laboratories help to develop defensive equipment used by Warfighters under nuclear, biological and chemical attack and to conduct biological research. The complex includes a Test Bay Area, which is composed of five test bays that are two stories high. The bays are specifically designed so that a typical combat vehicle can be driven into them for any functional testing. They are also equipped with movable and detachable engine exhaust hoses and rooftop ventilators. The high bay area serves as a production line area with space for up to 10 High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs) at one time. Computer Aided Design, experimental fabrication, and the electronics lab can be accessed from this area. This facility allows items to be assembled, tested and delivered from a single location. Recent facilities constructionStandoff Detection Technology Evaluation Facility= The Standoff Detection Technology Evaluation facility allows researchers to release a known amount of material while maintaining a calibrated material scatter so that a standoff detector‚Äôs ability to ‚Äúsee‚Äù can be accurately measured from up to several kilometers away. This increased precision reduces uncertainty about the potential field performance of standoff detectors. The Standoff Detection Technology Evaluation Facility was designed for use in the Artemis Chemical Standoff Detection Program to allow aerosol backscatter and vapor measurements with a frequency-agile carbon dioxide (CO2) Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) standoff detector. The chamber utilizes curtains of air produced by an interior vortex and balanced by an exterior counter flow of air to contain the material cloud. This also prevents the backscatter off of conventional hard windows from corrupting the desired measurements on the cloud inside the chamber. The prevention of backscatter is critical because the CO2 LIDAR has a long (1 microsecond) pulse and the backscatter off the window cannot be temporally separated from the backscatter off of an aerosol in the chamber. With modifications, this ECBC asset can be used with all passive and active, chemical and biological standoff technologies and systems at any stage of development. The chamber was designed for testing with a variety of CB simulants, interferents and selected toxic industrial chemicals in both vapor and aerosol form. ECBC is exploring the regulatory acceptability of extending the operations to include ‚Äúkill‚Äù pathogens, which would produce a tremendous benefit for the CBDP if permitted. Using ground truth instrumentation, the Standoff Detection Technology Evaluation Facility has been shown to successfully contain a homogenous aerosol cloud. =Sample Receipt Facility (SRF)= The Sample Receipt Facility, is the first full-range, interagency resource, funded by the U.S. Army, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, to receive, triage, sample and screen ‚Äúunknowns‚Äù with the potential of chemical, biological, radiological or explosive configurations. =Chemical Transfer (single small- scale) Facility= The Chemical Transfer Facility (CTF), built in 1983, is the only U.S. single small-scale facility, a single repository for the Army‚Äôs research and development stock of toxic chemical agents. The CTF is a Category II Security/Storage Facility, which houses bulk storage of chemical agents in accessible containers intended for withdrawal and issue to support research, development, testing and/or training operations. The CTF is the only location within the U.S. where chemical compounds defined by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) can be produced in amounts greater than 100 ml per year.

Archimage created Escape From Diab and Nanoswarm: Invasion from Inner Space, two multimillion-dollar PC games funded by the National Institutes of Health to combat obesity and type 2 diabetes in children. Early history Archimage, Inc was formed in Houston, Texas in 1990. The firm is the successor to Buday Wells, Architects, (Richard Buday, AIA and Dwayne Wells, AIA, RIBA partners) formed in 1983. Throughout most of its history, Archimage has been the poster child for creative companies successfully adapting to rapidly changing market conditions. Buday Wells, Architects, which opened during a severe contraction in Houston's oil-based economy, was an early pioneer in the use of computers in architecture. When founding partner Dwayne Wells died in 1990, the company incorporated as Archimage to more fully reflect its hybrid design practice. A variety of non- traditional architecture commissions such as broadcast television commercials resulted in the company winning 14 Caddie awards for its innovative computer- based design work in the architecture world. The visibility Archimage gained from its commissions and awards resulted in work expanding into mainstream animation. In 1992, Nintendo of America used the firm to create an animated trade show presentation, and business from the Walt Disney Company soon followed with the design of \\"Happy Castle.\\" In 1994, Archimage was enlisted to create 3D games and environments for 3D Dinosaur Adventure. Serious Video Game Design and Production Much of Archimage's recent work has been in a new area of interactive media called Games for Health, a genera of serious games. Their work in this field began by creating interactive tools for researchers at Baylor College of Medicine in the early '90s, which was later followed by the production and design of several multimedia behavioral interventions research projects created for kids. Archimage is one of the few design firms in this specialized area of game design. In 2003, the firm was awarded a Small Business Innovative Research Grant from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a division of the National Institutes of Health, to create two computer-based interventions for childhood obesity and Type 2 Diabetes.2003 NIH SBIR Grant #5U44DK066724-02 Archimage worked with behavior psychologists, nutritionists, and physical activity experts at the Children's Nutrition Research Center of Baylor College of Medicine to create two epic PC adventure video games about healthy eating and exercise entitled Escape from Diab and Nanoswarm: Invasion from Inner Space. Escape From Diab won several design awards including a Horizon Interactive Media Award, a Webby Award Nomination and an INDEX Award. Both games have gone under extensive clinical testing by BCM for efficacy in changing children's diet and exercise behaviors. With the knowledge gained from these two large serious game projects, Archimage transformed its design practice again in 2007 with a new focus on Web-based health game development. Playnormous was created as a way to give the general public access to research-based health games. Playnormous games are also created with the guidance of the medical community from Baylor College of Medicine and The University of Texas Health Science Center and are designed to change nutrition and physical activity lifestyle behaviors in children and their parents.

The Steirische Harmonika is distinguished from other diatonic button accordions by its typically richer bass notes, and by the presence of one key per scale row that has the same tone on both compression and expansion of the bellows, called a Gleichton. The bass notes earn the distinction Helikonb√§sse because they use bigger reeds with duralumin reed frames and a special chamber construction that amplifies its bass tones to give it a loud sound reminiscent of a Helicon tuba. The name \\"Steirische Harmonika\\" literally translates from German as Styrian accordion; the use of the adjective steirische stems from the Viennese dialect. Steirische refers to the state of Steiermark (Styria), or ≈†tajerska in Slovenian. This type of harmonika originated in Styria in the city of Windischgraz (or Slovenj Gradec in Slovenian), after the invention of the helikon bass reed by Franz Lubas in 1878.  Description  The Steirische Harmonika has melody side on the right, and a bass side on the left. On the melody side, there are three to five rows of buttons where each row has its own key. Accordions with five rows are used mostly in Austria. On the compression of the bellows, the buttons of one row play the tones from the key's tonic, and on the expansion of the bellows, the buttons of one row play tones from the key's dominant seventh. The button which plays the same tone on both the expansion and compression of the bellows is called the Gleichton, (\\"same-tone\\" in German). Often melodies require playing buttons from different rows because they cannot be decomposed into tones from the tonic and dominant seventh of a given key. Originally, there were two systems for the diatonic Steirische, the Slovenian System, which had no Gleichton and a flat keyboard, and the German or Austrian System with Gleichton and a stepped keyboard. The Slovenian System is no longer much used; even the Slovenian players today play the German or Austrian System. There is also a chromatic version of the Steirische, with the same treble system as the regular chromatic accordion. This is referred to as a \\"Semi-chromatic\\" (polkromatiƒçna harmonika), a \\"Half-chromatic\\", or a \\"12-bass chromatic\\". The treble side therefore sounds the same note in either bellows direction. The bass system does however sound different notes depending on bellows direction, but arranged so that all 12 notes of the scale can be played. This type of chromatic Steirische was popularized in America by Matt Hoyer, Johnny Pecon, and Lou Trebar. For each row on the right hand melody side, there are two associated buttons on the outer row of the bass side: one for the root, and one for the harmony. On compression, they play the tonic, and on expansion, the dominant. The function of the inner row, however, varies by manufacturer. Technical Steirische Accordion playing is very advanced especially in Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia.

To help aid playing the Steirische Harmonika, the Verlag Helbling publishers patented in 1916 a tablature, which no longer is in current use. It has come to be replaced by a notation called Griffschrift, which was invented by a music teacher from B√§rnbach in Styria named Max Rosenzopf. The notation appears similar to modern notation but maps tones to positions on the staff differently. In 1975 Rosenzopf founded the Verlag Preissler publishing company and printed the first book using the Griffschrift to teach reading notes. Now all notes for the Steirische Harmonika are printed using this notation. There is also a related instrument in Czechia and Slovakia called the heligonka harmonika.

The community could be a metropolitan area, region, or an entire country.  Overview  In 1997, The American Assembly published a report titled \\"Community Capitalism: Rediscovering the Markets of America's Urban Neighborhoods\\", which they distributed to business leaders, President Clinton, cabinet members, members of Congress and governors, and the general public. In 2013, George R. Tyler published the book What Went Wrong: How the 1% Hijacked the American Middle Class ... and What Other Countries Got Right, which describes the community capitalism models (which Tyler calls family capitalism) used by countries that have helped their citizens to prosper, despite the forces of globalization. He contrasts the experience of the U.S. over the past 30 years to that of Australia and the major nations of northern Europe (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden). In the United States, there is a growing opinion by some citizens across the political spectrum that the laissez-faire model of capitalism might be fundamentally flawed in some way. By re-framing the debate around how people can leverage the positive aspects of capitalism to strengthen communities, the hope is that the country can move beyond partisan politics and towards a collective plan of action.  In Kalamazoo, Michigan  Community capitalism is the long-term strategy for economic growth of Kalamazoo, Michigan. The system uses focused and organized philanthropy and business investment occurring simultaneously. It focuses community resources into five key areas: place, capital, infrastructure, talent and education. After a long period of corporate downsizings and results of mergers and acquisitions (most notably by Upjohn/Pharmacia/Pfizer, General Motors, First of America/National City and the paper industry), the Kalamazoo region went about changing the face of its downtown. It set up one of the nation's only community-based venture funds; establishing the \\"Southwest Michigan First Life Science Fund\\"; refurbishing a abandoned automotive stamping plant; building a life science accelerator; embracing the concept of talent-driven organizations; and funding the Kalamazoo Promise scholarship program. The community has since seen resurgence in job creation and overall economic growth. The term community capitalism was used by Fast Company magazine in naming Kalamazoo in its \\"Fast 50\\" list in 2007.

Many such books are declared prescribed books for the course of BUMS at the Indian System of Medicine and HomeopathyThe first-ever complete portal Unani medical science which was launched on 25 Aug. 2001 was also dedicated to him and his contribution towards Unani. Besides Unani professional institutions, he was also attached to various education and non-Unani Institutions serving the cause of Humanity. He was also associated with Rotary in a big way. Hakim Hammad Usmani sahib died on 30 December 2000 at Allahabad, leaving behind his widow, Begum Shakeela Khatoon, his five sons ((Late) Dr.Saad Usmani, Shimweel Usmani, Yasmaneel Usmani, Sufyan Usmani, Zeyad Usmani) and five daughters. Hammad Sahib was 72. After his death, his eldest son Dr. Saad Usmani further consolidated the cause he worked for.

The process has finite moments distinguishing it from many L√©vy processes. There is no diffusion component in the VG process and it is thus a pure jump process. The increments are independent and follow a Variance-gamma distribution, which is a generalization of the Laplace distribution. There are several representations of the VG process that relate it to other processes. It can for example be written as a Brownian motion W(t) with drift \\\\theta t subjected to a random time change which follows a gamma process \\\\Gamma(t; 1, u) (equivalently one finds in literature the notation \\\\Gamma(t;\\\\gamma=1/ u,\\\\lambda=1/ u)): : X^{VG}(t; \\\\sigma, u, \\\\theta) \\\\;:=\\\\; \\\\theta \\\\,\\\\Gamma(t; 1, u) + \\\\sigma\\\\,W(\\\\Gamma(t; 1, u)) \\\\quad. An alternative way of stating this is that the variance gamma process is a Brownian motion subordinated to a Gamma subordinator. Since the VG process is of finite variation it can be written as the difference of two independent gamma processes: : X^{VG}(t; \\\\sigma, u, \\\\theta) \\\\;:=\\\\; \\\\Gamma(t; \\\\mu_p, \\\\mu_p^2\\\\, u) - \\\\Gamma(t; \\\\mu_q, \\\\mu_q^2\\\\, u) where : \\\\mu_p := \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta^2 + \\\\frac{2\\\\sigma^2}{ u}} + \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\quad\\\\quad\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\mu_q := \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\sqrt{\\\\theta^2 + \\\\frac{2\\\\sigma^2}{ u}} - \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{2} \\\\quad. Alternatively it can be approximated by a compound Poisson process that leads to a representation with explicitly given (independent) jumps and their locations. This last characterization gives an understanding of the structure of the sample path with location and sizes of jumps. On the early history of the variance-gamma process see Seneta (2000).  Moments  The mean of a variance gamma process is independent of \\\\sigma and u and is given by :E[X(t)] = \\\\theta t The variance is given as :Var[X(t)] = (\\\\theta^2 u + \\\\sigma^2)t The 3rd central moment is :E[(X(t) - E[X(t)])^3] = (2 \\\\theta^3 u^2 + 3 \\\\sigma^2 \\\\theta u)t The 4th central moment is :E[(X(t) - E[X(t)])^4] = (3 \\\\sigma^4 u + 12 \\\\sigma^2 \\\\theta^2 u^2 + 6 \\\\theta^4 u^3)t + (3 \\\\sigma^4 + 6 \\\\sigma^2 \\\\theta^2 u + 3 \\\\theta^4 u^2)t^2  Option pricing  The VG process can be advantageous to use when pricing options since it allows for a wider modeling of skewness and kurtosis than the Brownian motion does. As such the variance gamma model allows to consistently price options with different strikes and maturities using a single set of parameters. Madan and Seneta present a symmetric version of the variance gamma process. Madan, Carr and Chang extend the model to allow for an asymmetric form and present a formula to price European options under the variance gamma process. Hirsa and Madan show how to price American options under variance gamma. Fiorani presents numerical solutions for European and American barrier options under variance gamma process. PDF. He also provides computer programming code to price vanilla and barrier European and American barrier options under variance gamma process. Lemmens et al. construct bounds for arithmetic Asian options for several L√©vy models including the variance gamma model.  Applications to Credit Risk Modeling  The variance gamma process has been successfully applied in the modeling of credit risk in structural models. The pure jump nature of the process and the possibility to control skewness and kurtosis of the distribution allow the model to price correctly the risk of default of securities having a short maturity, something that is generally not possible with structural models in which the underlying assets follow a Brownian motion.

In an extensive empirical test they show the overperformance of the pricing under variance gamma, compared to alternative models presented in literature. Simulation Monte Carlo methods for the variance gamma process are described by Fu (2000). Algorithms are presented by Korn et al. (2010).

Life  Eduardo Anguita was raised in San Bernardo, before integrating the College of the Augustine Fathers in Santiago. At 16, he began law studies in the Catholic University of Chile, which he dropped three years later in order to dedicate himself to literature. From then on, he collaborated to many reviews and newspapers, such as Ercilla, Plan, Atenea, La Naci√≥n, El Mercurio, etc. He also worked in advertising agencies and in various radios. His first poems were published in 1934 under the name Tr√°nsito al fin, and translated in English in 1942. A member of the Generation of 38, Eduardo Anguita started his literary career during a period marked by Surrealism and Creationism, a movement headed by Vicente Huidobro, to whom he became a close friend. Alongside Volodia Teitelboim, Anguita published in 1935 the Antolog√≠a de Poes√≠a Chilena Nueva, which included poems by Vicente Huidobro, Rosamel del Valle, Pablo de Rokha, Pablo Neruda, Humberto D√≠az Casanueva, Omar C√°ceres, Angel Cruchaga Santa Mar√≠a, Juvencio Valle and both Anguita himself and Teitelboim. Three years later, a short story by Anguita (Las Hormigas Devoran a un Hombre Llamado David) was included in Miguel Serrano's Antolog√≠a del verdadero cuento en Chile. The US New Directions Publishers selected him in 1944, along with his friend Pablo Neruda, to be part of its yearly anthology of Latin-American contemporary poetry. During Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo's government (1955), he was named cultural attache in Mexico, where he published Palabras al o√≠do de M√©xico in 1960. At the end of his life he worked at the Editorial Universitaria as a publisher.  Works  Topics = Anguita has been considered a metaphysical poet due to the nature of the topics he writes about and the philosophical reflection he makes about them in his poetry. His principal subjects include beauty, death, the temporary nature of man, and memory. There is also space in his work for the topic of religion, as the poet was openly associated with Catholicism. However, he was not an orthodox catholic and was influenced by various ideas. These include the pagan idea of an animated reality and the repeal of \\"myself\\" from Buddhism, as well as ideals from profane poets connected with the appraisal of the body and eroticism. It is due to the latter influence that an erotic relationship with divinity can be seen in some of his poems. His work is summarized as a metaphysical and erotic poetry, always linked to a religious character. = His conception of poetry = It is necessary to depart from the idea that Anguita focuses on a poetry completely separated from mimesis; it's an intellectual poetry. In the introduction to the anthology he creates alongside fellow Chilean author Teitelboim, both expound upon the concept of the function of poetry. In this manner of thought, poetry would be a way for the soul to speak and ask that it be considered in the universe; it cannot be simply thought of as an item of entertainment. Anguita has said that for him, poetry is first the vision of something and should always be expressed this way the first time. He establishes a radical difference between the language of poetry and everyday language. The commonly used tongue would be developing in a vigilant state of conscience, while poetry is produced by the clashing of the conscience and the subconscious.

Public safety divers differ from recreational, scientific and commercial divers who can generally plan the date, time, and location of a dive, and dive only if the conditions are conducive to the task. Public safety divers respond to emergencies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and may be required to dive in the middle of the night, during inclement weather, in zero visibility \\"black water,\\" or in waters polluted by chemicals and biohazards. Specialized skills In addition to basic diving skills training, public safety divers require specialized training for recognizing hazards, conducting risk assessments, search procedures, diving in zero visibility, using full- face masks with communication systems, and recovering evidence that is admissible in court. Some of the water they are required to dive in is contaminated, and they may be required to wear vulcanized drysuits, with diving helmets sealed to the suit, and utilize surface supplied air. At times, the decontamination process that takes place out of the water can be longer than the dive time. Public safety diving personnel In the US, many public safety divers are volunteers, but career law enforcement or fire rescue personnel also often take on these additional responsibilities as part of their occupation. Firefighters will find the diving equipment has similarities to the full face masks and breathing apparatus worn in smoke filled environments. Law enforcement personnel are also trained as public safety divers because of their training and experience in handling evidence and presenting evidence in court. Health and Safety aspectsJurisdiction=USA Depending on state legislation, public safety divers in the USA may fall under state or federal occupational safety and health legislation. Federal legislation applies where there is no relevant state legislation and the divers are employees diving as part of their occupation. If they fall under federal legislation they are exempt (excluded) from specific requirements of 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart T, Commercial Diving Operations, only during diving activities incidental to police and public-safety functions the purpose of which is to provide search, rescue, or public-safety diving services. The exemption was written to include the ability to deviate from safe diving practices under limited conditions where compliance would be impracticable due to time constraints or the possible consequences of failing to perform the task overwhelm the risks taken using available facilities. This exclusion does not apply during training, recovery operations, searches where there is no reasonable probability of rescue of a living person or there is no real and immediate public safety hazard. The specific federal legislation does not apply to volunteers where there is no employer/employee relationship.

He was killed by Catholics for opposition to the Union of Brest. Saint Athanasius is commemorated on September 5. Athanasius Filipovich was born to a petty Lithuanian nobleman in Brest-Litovsk, then part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. As a well-educated man in modern and ancient languages, the writings of the Church Fathers, and the works of Western philosophers and theologians, Athanasius worked for several years as a private tutor. In 1627 he entered the Monastery of the Holy Spirit in Vilnius. He later moved to other monasteries and was ordained a priest. In 1637, he transferred to the Monastery of Kupyatitsk near Minsk. He was sent to collect donations for the restoration of the church. The journey was accompanied by visions, miraculous signs, and physical dangers. In 1640, Athanasius became hegumen of the Monastery of St Simeon Stylites in Brest-Litovsk. From then on, he advocated against Roman proselytism and the Union of Brest. In 1643, he spoke before the Polish sejm (parliament) in favor of Orthodoxy and against the Union. He was proclaimed insane, arrested, and stripped of his monastic titles. Athanasius was then sent to Peter Mogila, Metropolitan of Kiev, who sent him back to Brest-Litovsk. That did not stop his protests and Athanasius was arrested again in 1664, but was released a year later. The Khmelnytsky Uprising among the Ukrainian Cossacks started in 1648. Athanasius was accused of ties with the rebels. He was arrested, tortured, and executed. His remains were found on July 20, 1649 ‚Äì the day is sometimes commemorated as an alternative feast day.

He was born in Paris and spent most of his life there.  Biography  Nordling's father, Carl Gustav Nordling, arrived in Paris from Sweden at the end of the 1870s, and established the paper-paste firm \\"Gustav Nordling\\". Born in Paris, Raoul studied at the lyc√©e Janson-de- Sailly, and then joined his father's company, eventually succeeding him at its helm. He was appointed as Swedish vice-consul in Paris in 1905 at the age of 24, becoming consul in 1917 and consul-general in 1926, on the death of his father. Although Nordling was Swedish by nationality, he felt himself to be above all a \\"citizen of Paris\\". He spoke French much more often than Swedish, having to virtually learn his national language when he went to Sweden as a young man to complete his military service. Throughout his working life, Nordling played an important role in mediating between Sweden and France, but he is best remembered for his efforts to mediate between French and German forces during the occupation and Liberation of Paris during the Second World War. He played an important role in ensuring Red Cross access to prisoners of war, and during the uprising of the French resistance in August 1944 he negotiated with the German commander General Dietrich von Choltitz, to try to limit the bloodshed and damage to the city. Many accounts of these events attribute him a major role in doing so, and he was honoured by France after the Liberation with the highest available medal, the Croix de guerre avec palme. A play area in the 11th Arrondissement, the \\"Square Raoul Nordling\\" is named in his honour, as is a street in Neuilly. He continued to play an active role in Parisian social life after the end of the war. He lived in a house called \\"Le Mas du Gay Savoir\\" in Sainte-Maxime, which made him an honorary citizen. During the late 1940s, he intervened with the Danish and French security services to secure more lenient treatment for the writer Louis- Ferdinand C√©line, who had been imprisoned in Denmark while the French authorities sought his extradition because his openly expressed antisemitism led to charges of collaboration with the occupying Germans and the Vichy r√©gime during the war.Hewitt, N. (1999).The Life of C√©line: A critical biography. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 250 In popular culture Nordling is played by Orson Welles in the film Is Paris Burning? (1966) and by Andr√© Dussollier in the film Diplomacy (2014).

Gardner (born 19 March 1953) is a former British, Commonwealth, and European Heavyweight Champion. A stocky, game, pressure fighter, his speed and aggression made him a marginal top ten contender for the World Heavyweight Title. Gardner was active in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His best arena was the British and European boxing scene. Early life and career John Lewis Gardner was born in his hometown of Hackney, England. He won the North West London Heavyweight Championship as an amateur in 1973 and turned professional at age twenty. His managers were G. Steene and Terry Lawless. Professional boxer Gardner won his first 24 fights in a row, remaining undefeated for almost five years, most of his fights won by TKO against a collection of British, European and American journeymen. He defeated Neville Meade, a future British Heavyweight Champion, and the fairly useful Bjorn Rudi and Ngozika Ekwelum during this period, before being caught cold in the first round in 1977 by Ibar Arrington (Gardner was a notoriously slow starter). However, he earned his first title shot that year in 1977 when he defeated Denton Ruddock by TKO for the Southern Area British Heavyweight Championship. British and Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship Gardner, a contender for the vacant British and Commonwealth Heavyweight Championship in 1978, defeated Billy Aird by TKO for the title. Gardner then defeated Greg Sorrentini and the useful American contender Mike Koranicki. Afterwards, Gardner defended his title against the notorious Paul Sykes in 1979, winning by TKO after six rounds forcing his opponent to back down. Later that year, he vacanted the title and lost a points decision to top contender Jimmy Young over ten rounds. European Heavyweight Championship Gardner defeated Belgium's Rudy Gauwe by TKO in 1980 for the Vacant European Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Gardner knocked out European rated Italian Lorenzo Zanon in his first title defense in 1980 after five rounds. Gardner, who never lost a title fight during his career, vacanted the title in hopes of a world title. Gardner then defeated world rated Ossie Ocasio, the future world cruiserweight champion, in 1980 by KO after six rounds. Heavyweight contender Gardner then signed a contract to fight Muhammad Ali, the legendary Heavyweight Champion of the World. The fighters were scheduled to fight in Hawaii, but Ali backed out of the deal, retiring. He did however in the late 1970s fight a televised three round exhibition with Ali in London. Ali clearly got the upper hand but it was interesting and a big moment for British fans. In 1981 Gardner traveled to Detroit, Michigan, to fight the fast moving top rated Michael Dokes. Although Gardner had the better fighting record but against lesser opponents, Dokes was in his prime and the Englishman was knocked out after four rounds. Gardner soon retired at age 28, taking a year off before making an attempted comeback. He defeated American fringe fighters Ricky James and Lou Benson, Jr before being knocked out in two rounds with Noel Quarless.

Theory Consider a binary that consists of two massive objects (stars, black holes etc.) and that is embedded in a stellar system containing a large number of stars. Let M_1 and M_2 be the masses of the two components of the binary whose total mass is M_{12}=M_1+M_2. A field star that approaches the binary with impact parameter p and velocity V passes a distance r_p from the binary, where p^2=r_p^2\\\\left(1+2GM_{12}/V^2r_p\\\\right) \\\\approx 2GM_{12}r_p/V^2; the latter expression is valid in the limit that gravitational focusing dominates the encounter rate. The rate of encounters with stars that interact strongly with the binary, i.e. that satisfy r_p < a, is approximately n\\\\pi p^2 \\\\sigma =2\\\\pi GM_{12} n a/\\\\sigma where n and \\\\sigma are the number density and velocity dispersion of the field stars and a is the semi-major axis of the binary. As it passes near the binary, the field star experiences a change in velocity of order \\\\Delta V \\\\approx V_{\\\\rm bin} = \\\\sqrt{GM_{12}/a} , where V_{\\\\rm bin} is the relative velocity of the two stars in the binary. The change in the field star's specific angular momentum with respect to the binary, l, is then Œîl ‚âà a Vbin. Conservation of angular momentum implies that the binary's angular momentum changes by Œîlbin ‚âà -(m/Œº12)Œîl where m is the mass of a field star and Œº12 is the binary reduced mass. Changes in the magnitude of lbin correspond to changes in the binary's orbital eccentricity via the relation e = 1 - lb2/GM12Œº12a. Changes in the direction of lbin correspond to changes in the orientation of the binary, leading to rotational diffusion. The rotational diffusion coefficient is \\\\langle\\\\Delta\\\\xi^2\\\\rangle = \\\\langle\\\\Delta l_{\\\\rm bin}^2\\\\rangle / l_{\\\\rm bin}^2 \\\\approx \\\\left({m\\\\over M_{12}}\\\\right)^2 \\\\langle\\\\Delta l^2\\\\rangle/GM_{12}a \\\\approx {m\\\\over M_{12}} {G\\\\rho a\\\\over\\\\sigma} where œÅ = mn is the mass density of field stars. Let F(Œ∏,t) be the probability that the rotation axis of the binary is oriented at angle Œ∏ at time t. The evolution equation for F is {\\\\partial F\\\\over\\\\partial t} = {1\\\\over\\\\sin\\\\theta} {\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\theta} \\\\left(\\\\sin\\\\theta{\\\\langle\\\\Delta\\\\xi^2\\\\rangle\\\\over 4} {\\\\partial F\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\theta}\\\\right). If <ŒîŒæ2>, a, œÅ and œÉ are constant in time, this becomes {\\\\partial F\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\tau} = {1\\\\over 2} {\\\\partial\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\mu} \\\\left[(1-\\\\mu^2) {\\\\partial F\\\\over\\\\partial\\\\mu}\\\\right] where Œº = cos Œ∏ and œÑ is the time in units of the relaxation time trel, where t_{\\\\rm rel} \\\\approx {M_{12}\\\\over m} {\\\\sigma\\\\over G\\\\rho a}. The solution to this equation states that the expectation value of Œº decays with time as \\\\overline\\\\mu = \\\\overline{\\\\mu}_0 e^{-\\\\tau}. Hence, trel is the time constant for the binary's orientation to be randomized by torques from field stars. Applications Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed in the context of binary supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.Merritt, D. (2002), Rotational Brownian Motion of a Massive Binary, The Astrophysical Journal, 568, 998-1003. Perturbations from passing stars can alter the orbital plane of such a binary, which in turn alters the direction of the spin axis of the single black hole that forms when the two coalesce. Rotational Brownian motion is often observed in N-body simulations of galaxies containing binary black holes.L√∂ckmann, U. and Baumgardt, H. (2008), Tracing intermediate-mass black holes in the Galactic Centre, Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 384, 323-330. Matsubayashi, T., Makino, J. and Ebisuzaki, T. (2007), Evolution of an IMBH in the Galactic Nucleus with a Massive Central Black Hole, The Astrophysical Journal, 656, 879-896 The massive binary sinks to the center of the galaxy via dynamical friction where it interacts with passing stars. The same gravitational perturbations that induce a random walk in the orientation of the binary, also cause the binary to shrink, via the gravitational slingshot. It can be shown that the rms change in the binary's orientation, from the time the binary forms until the two black holes collide, is roughly \\\\delta\\\\theta\\\\approx \\\\sqrt{20m/M_{12}}. In a real galaxy, the two black holes would eventually coalesce due to emission of gravitational waves. The spin axis of the coalesced hole will be aligned with the angular momentum axis of the orbit of the pre-existing binary. Hence, a mechanism like rotational Brownian motion that affects the orbits of binary black holes can also affect the distribution of black hole spins. This may explain in part why the spin axes of supermassive black holes appear to be randomly aligned with respect to their host galaxies.Kinney, A. et al.

In the standard frictionless Arrow-Debreu model, since the nonmonetary competitive equilibria are already Pareto optimal, money can't facilitate exchange or is at best useless. A common approach in monetary economics is to either require that agents hold money for institutional reasons (for example, to pay taxes, or because the government forces individuals to accept it), to enter money holdings directly into individual's utility functions (the so-called \\"money in utility\\" or Sidrauski model), or to impose an arbitrary Cash-in-advance constraint (the so-called Clower constraint). However all of these approaches are somewhat ad hoc and do not explain why intrinsically worthless money can have value as medium of exchange. The turnpike model of money is one of the possible resolutions of this theoretical problem.Townsend R.

Commonly used in business-to-business, business-to-government, or longer business-to- consumer sales cycles, demand generation involves multiple areas of marketing and is really the marriage of marketing programs coupled with a structured sales process. There are multiple components of a stepped demand generation process that vary based on the size and complexity of a sale. These components include, among other things: building awareness, positioning relevance, supporting validation and mitigating customer evaluation. Useful demand generation methodologies include AIDA (attract Attention, maintain Interest, create Desire, get Action), developed by E. St. Elmo Lewis. Building awareness Demand generation is a holistic approach to marketing and sales cohesion within the company. Through various nurture campaigns and marketing approaches, demand generation efforts aim to both create a long-term relationship between a brand and a potential buyer, and at the same time gauge and develop a prospect's purchasing interest in said brand's products/services. Building brand or product/service awareness is a vital component in the demand generation process, and often takes a continued effort and involves multiple facets of marketing. Advanced demand generation programs typically rely on some form of proactive Lead Generation activities supported by more traditional market programs and processes. This is because demand generation programs tend to assume that prospective customers are aware that they have a need or problem, and are attempting to solve it when they search for solutions. If the prospect is unaware (consciously or, at least, subconsciously) that they have the problem, then demand generation may not be effective - thus the need for adjunct lead generation activities. Facilitating discovery The second key area of focus for a marketer focused on demand generation is ensuring that when a prospect decides to seek a vendor to provide a solution in a given solution category, they discover the vendor that the marketer serves. This is again accomplished with a variety of techniques and tools, often overlapping with the tools used for creating awareness of the category, but with a different emphasis. * Search engine advertising ‚Äì the purchase of advertisements on search engines to appear when keywords on the specific category, or known competitors in the solution space, are searched for. * Search engine optimization ‚Äì the use of a variety of techniques to increase a web site‚Äôs natural position in search engine results when keywords on the specific category, or known competitors in the solution space, are searched for * Webinars or seminars ‚Äì online web based seminars, or in person seminars to allow prospective buyers to discover and understand a vendor‚Äôs solution, how it can be used, and who else is using it, in detail * Demonstrations and free trials ‚Äì easily accessed, often online, tools for demonstrating a solution or accessing a time-limited or feature-constrained trial version to assist prospective buyers in discovering the solution and its fit with their need Again, in this phase of the demand generation process, many approaches and tools are used and this list is only a selection of the more common approaches. Guiding solution validation Often confused with demand generation is the lead process itself. Converting demand into sales is a totally separate task. Many companies, however, will call themselves demand generation organizations when they are really lead generating. This later phase of the buying process involves validating that a selected vendor will meet specified requirements, coming to an agreement with the vendor on costs, contract terms, support and services, and finalizing the purchase process. This often involves coordinating the involvement of other organizational and extra-organizational resources such as sales representatives and reference clients. * Marketing tools as detailed above ‚Äì trials, demonstrations, whitepapers, and seminars designed for a more detailed evaluation and validation of the solution in question * Reference management ‚Äì cultivation, management, and selection of client references willing to provide a potential purchaser with the perspective of a current (or past) client. * Sales involvement ‚Äì coordination of the right sales resource to interact with the prospect to navigate the final stages of the buying process including contract negotiation, legal terms and conditions, and signoff. The coordination of sales involvement, the selection of the right sales resource, and the timing of the involvement can be difficult to determine. The scoring, ranking, and routing of leads into sales is a sufficiently deep topic to warrant further exploration. =Sales involvement= The involvement of sales professionals in the solution validation process involves three main aspects. These are the same whether inside sales or field sales professionals are being involved. * Lead scoring - understanding which prospective buyers warrant being contacted by a sales professional. Lead scoring involves scoring two distinct aspects of the prospect; whether he or she is qualified to be a buyer, and whether he or she is interested in being a buyer. The former looks at explicit information such as title, industry, and revenues to understand whether that individual is able to make a buying decision, while the latter examines implicit information such as recent online activity and marketing response in order to determine whether the individual is currently interested in making a buying decision. Many Marketers will take a simple approach by labelling lead scoring criteria on two foundations: behavioral scoring and demographic scoring. * Lead ranking ‚Äì based on the scoring of leads, leads can be assigned ranks based on the business process sales should follow in interacting with the leads. For example, if explicit scoring leads to a 1, 2, or 3 ranking on how qualified the lead is, while implicit scoring leads to an A, B, or C ranking on how interested the lead is, a follow-up process may have 1A leads contacted within 24hrs, 1B leads contacted by a field sales professional within 72hrs, while 1C, 2A, and 2B leads are contacted by an inside sales professional and 2C and all leads ranked as a 3 are not contacted. * Lead routing ‚Äì once a business process is determined, a lead routing process determines which lead should be connected with which salesperson, based on geographic territory, industry, company size, or any other factor. Often this involves management of the notification of the salesperson and monitoring of the time taken to follow up. Related disciplines In order to effectively manage and optimize the required communication, response, and lead management processes outlined above, marketers focused on demand generation must become proficient at two other related disciplines * Data management ‚Äì the centralization, de- duplication, profiling, appending, normalizing and cleansing of marketing data so that it can be effectively used to personalize communications, define target lists and segments, score leads, and route leads to sales. * Marketing analytics ‚Äì the analysis of the effectiveness of marketing efforts, from individual tactics such as email communications or landing pages through to overall campaign performance.

Futures Without Violence is involved in community-based programs, developing educational materials, and in public policy work.  About  For more than 30 years, Futures Without Violence (previously known as Family Violence Prevention Fund) has been developing programs, policies, and campaigns geared toward individuals and organizations working to end violence against women and children around the world. The national nonprofit trains professionals such as doctors, nurses, judges, and athletic coaches on improving responses to violence and abuse. Futures Without Violence also works with advocates, policymakers, and others in an effort to build sustainable community leadership and educate people about the importance of respect and healthy relationships. Origins In 1980, Esta Soler received a federal grant and founded the Family Violence Project. The grant money provided more funding and resources for education and training programs in response to domestic violence calls for police departments to undergo. This police response reform had a domino effect for police departments across the country. Development Soon after the grant for the Family Violence Project and the nationwide police response reform concerning domestic violence cases, Soler partnered up with various organizations to form the Violence Against Women Act. The bill was drafted to provide more funding and services for domestic violence shelters across the country, to change the way police departments and court systems handled domestic violence cases, to provide more training and intervention programs concerning domestic violence, and help support public education campaigns nationwide. The Violence Against Women Act was passed on September 13, 1994. Domestic violence has decreased 80% since 1980 as a result. The Family Violence Project was later renamed as Futures Without Violence in 2011. Esta Soler still serves as the founder and president of the nonprofit. Futures Without Violence is known for its anti-violence education programs, domestic violence advocacy campaigns, and intervention and prevention of domestic violence.  Shaping Public Policy  Futures Without Violence was a driving force behind passage of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994‚Äîthe nation‚Äôs first comprehensive federal response to the violence that plagues families and communities. Congress reauthorized and expanded the law in 2000, 2005, and 2013. The organization is now working with advocates, policymakers, and more to spearhead efforts to pass the International Violence Against Women Act to prevent gender-based violence on a global scale.  Campaigns  Coaching Boys into Men In 2001, Futures Without Violence and the Advertising Council launched a public-education campaign called Coaching Boys into Men. This media campaign encourages men to talk to the boys in their life about the importance of respect and nonviolence. The Coaching Boys into Men media campaign included television, radio, and print public service announcements in multiple languages. In 2004, Coaching Boys Into Men expanded from a media campaign into a sports-based program for athletic coaches to lead with their young male athletes. The Coaching Boys into Men Coaches Leadership Program includes tools and resources to guide coaches in talking to their athletes about respect, non-violence, and relationships. The program provides support materials for coaches to lead weekly activities with their athletes throughout the sports season. Coaching Boys Into Men also includes work outside of the United States. In 2007, Futures Without Violence and UNICEF partnered to develop and distribute an International Coaches Manual that includes quotes and endorsement from stars such as David Beckham, Emmanuel Adebayor, and Thierry Henry. In 2009, Futures Without Violence began an initiative with the Nike Foundation to develop a cricket-based Coaching Boys Into Men program in India. The program has since been introduced in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Start Strong: Building Healthy Teen Relationships Start Strong: Building Healthy Teen Relationships is the largest initiative ever funded to target 11- to- 14-year-olds and rally entire communities to promote healthy relationships as the way to prevent teen dating violence and abuse. A national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in collaboration with Futures Without Violence, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Blue Shield of California Foundation invested $18 million in 11 Start Strong communities across the country to identify and evaluate best practices in prevention to stop dating violence and abuse before it starts. RESPECT! The RESPECT! Campaign is a social action campaign designed to promote respect in relationships and increase awareness about the positive role everyone can play to help end and prevent relationship violence and abuse. =The RESPECT! Campaign was a multi-year initiative supported by Macy‚Äôs, the national founding partner and exclusive retailer of the official RESPECT! bracelet. That's Not Cool In 2009, Futures Without Violence and The Advertising Council launched That‚Äôs Not Cool, a national public service advertising campaign that uses digital examples of controlling behavior online and by cell phone to encourage teens to draw their own line about what is, or is not, okay in a relationship. This multimedia campaign, created pro bono by R/GA, includes an interactive website and mobile app.  Programs  Health Futures Without Violence provides health care providers with resources to help identify and respond to domestic violence. The organization hosts the biennial National Health Conference on Domestic Violence, convening medical, public health, and domestic violence experts from across the U.S. to advance the health care system‚Äôs response to domestic violence. The organization provides technical assistance and materials to thousands of people each year through the National Health Resource Center on Domestic Violence.http://www.articlearchives.com/society-social/violence-society- domestic-violence/971095-1.html The Center is one of five specialized domestic violence resource centers in the country funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Judicial Education Futures Without Violence‚Äôs National Judicial Institute gives judges guidelines, education, and materials to ensure that their courtrooms provide help to victims of family violence. Early Childhood Trauma The Futures Without Violence Children‚Äôs Initiative works with domestic violence and batterer intervention programs, child welfare agencies, and community organizers to build collaborations and partnerships that promote safe and healthy families. As the national technical assistance provider of Attorney General Eric Holder's Defending Childhood Initiative to prevent and reverse the impact of early exposure to violence on children, the organization leads the prevention, intervention, treatment, and community organizing strategies used by every Defending Childhood site across the nation. Domestic and Sexual Violence Prevention in the Workplace Futures Without Violence's Workplace Project is a collaboration with employers and unions, and offers an online resource kit which includes items like sample workplace domestic violence policies, education and training materials, case studies, and resources.

He primarily plays as a lock. Cannon currently plays for English Championship side Ealing Trailfinders. He joined the side in April 2019. He has previously played for Connacht, Wasps and Northampton Saints, and has had loan spells with Bedford Blues and London Scottish. Early life Cannon was born in Kettering and attended Bishop Stopford School in the town. He is the son of Vince Cannon, who made 438 appearances for Northampton Saints, captained the side and is in the club's Hall of Fame. Despite this Cannon didn't play rugby until he was in secondary school. Cannon also played for local rugby club Kettering RFC, lining out for the team in the Midlands Division 2 East. From Kettering, he was signed to the Northampton Saints academy. Club rugby careerNorthampton Saints= Cannon joined Northampton Saints academy for the 2007‚Äì08 season. He made his debut for the first team in the 2007‚Äì08 National Division One on 4 March 2008. He was still in the academy but an injury crisis meant that he started in the midweek game against Launceston, which Northampton won 72‚Äì7. Cannon was named on the bench against Pertemps Bees four days later, but did not come on. He made his second appearance for the side as a replacement against Exeter Chiefs on 22 March 2016 and started against Nottingham a week later on 29 March. Cannon made a total of three appearances for the Saints in his debut season as they were promoted to the Premiership. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, Cannon's second year in the academy, he didn't feature for Northampton's first team after the club's return to the Premiership. He was an unused replacement in a 2008‚Äì09 EDF Energy Cup game against Bristol. In October 2007, Cannon was sent out on loan to get game time. Loan to Bedford Blues Cannon was loaned to Bedford Blues in the National League 1 for the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his debut for the team on 1 November 2008 when he played the full 80 minutes against Cornish Pirates. Cannon made a total 17 appearances for the Blues during his loan, all but four of these coming as starts, as Bedford finished third in the division. Return to Northampton Cannon stayed with Northampton Saints for the 2009‚Äì10 season. He made his Premiership debut on 31 October 2009 against Leicester Tigers, starting the match and playing 55 minutes in a 29‚Äì15 loss. Cannon featured in two more games in the 2009‚Äì10 Premiership, coming on as a late replacement against Leeds Carnegie and starting against Bath. Saints finished second in the league table, but were beaten in the semi-final by Saracens. He also played three times in the 2009‚Äì10 LV Cup, which Saints ultimately won, and scored his first try in a Cup game against Ospreys. Cannon played in a total of six games for the first team over the course of the season. He left the club at the end of the season having made a total of nine first team appearances. =Wasps= It was announced in April 2010 that Cannon had signed a two-year deal with Wasps. He joined the side ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 season. Cannon made his Wasps debut in a 2010‚Äì11 Premiership against Newcastle Falcons on 10 September 2010. He made his first ever appearance in the Heineken Cup as a replacement against Toulouse on 10 October 2010. Cannon made a total of 15 appearances in the Premiership in his first season with the side and played in four of Wasps' six games in the 2010‚Äì11 Heineken Cup. He also started four games in the 2010‚Äì11 LV Cup. Cannon didn't play in the 2010‚Äì11 Challenge Cup for the side, being an unused replacement in the team's only game in the competition, a 32‚Äì22 defeat to Harlequins in the quarter-finals. All together, he made 23 appearances in his debut season, all but five of these coming as starts. Cannon didn't play as regularly for Wasps in his second season, missing a large part of the season through injury. His first appearance of the year came on 24 February 2012, when he played 80 minutes in a 2011‚Äì12 Premiership match against Sale Sharks in a 46‚Äì34 defeat. He played in a further four Premiership games, as Wasps finished in 11th place avoiding relegation by just one point. Cannon also made a single appearance in the 2011‚Äì12 Challenge Cup, starting in the quarter-final against Biarritz which Wasps lost 26‚Äì23. Despite his lack of game time over the course of the season, Cannon signed a contract extension with Wasps in March 2012. With his return to fitness, Cannon played more regularly in the 2012‚Äì13 season. He made 12 appearances in the 2012‚Äì13 Premiership, with eight of these coming as starts, as Wasps finished 8th. Cannon played in four of Wasps' six pool stage games in the 2012‚Äì13 Challenge Cup and scored his first try for the club against Mogliano, but didn't feature in the quarter-final defeat to Leinster. In addition to the league and Challenge Cup, he also played in four games in the 2012‚Äì13 LV Cup. Cannon played a total of 22 games in his third season with the team, and on the back of these performances was awarded another contract extension. Cannon played 12 times in the 2013‚Äì14 Premiership, starting four of these games. He also played in three games in the 2013‚Äì14 Challenge Cup and four in the 2013‚Äì14 LV Cup, starting all of these. At the end of the season, Wasps finished 7th in the Premiership, which put them into a play-off to qualify for the following season's Champions Cup. Cannon did not take part in the two-leg play-off against Stade Fran√ßais, which Wasps won. In the following season, Cannon continued to have a limited role in the first team, starting five of the team's 2014‚Äì15 Premiership games and coming on as a replacement in a further three. He started all four of the team's games in the 2014‚Äì15 LV Cup, and featured from the replacements bench in a 2014‚Äì15 Champions Cup game against Castres. Despite his lack of game time, Cannon signed another contract extension with Wasps for the 2015‚Äì16 season. Cannon made his first appearance of the 2015‚Äì16 season in a Premiership game against Harlequins on 16 October 2015. In the middle of the season however, Cannon went on loan to London Scottish in the Championship. He made a single appearance for the side during his loan, starting against Rotherham Titans on 5 December 2015. Cannon returned to Wasps in the new year and featured from the bench against his former club Northampton Saints on 29 January 2016. Following this, he played in eight more Premiership fixtures, making a total of 10 appearances for Wasps for the season. After spending the 2016‚Äì17 preseason with Wasps, Cannon left the club in September 2016, having made 93 appearances for the first team. =Connacht= Cannon joined Irish side Connacht in September 2016. He signed on a one-year deal with the club for the 2016‚Äì17 season and was included in the province's European squad. He made 16 appearances in his first season, and signed a two-year extension to his deal in February 2017. In his second season, Cannon was a regular starter for the side. He appeared 21 times in all competitions, starting all but three of his 17 games in the league. The following season he continued to appear regularly, but was primarily used as a replacement coming off the bench in nine games and starting eight. In the Challenge Cup, he started four of the teams group games and also started the quarter-final defeat against Sale Sharks. In April 2019, it was announced that Cannon would leave Connacht at the end of the 2018‚Äì19 season. =Ealing Trailfinders= Following his departure from Connacht, Cannon signed for English Championship side Ealing Trailfinders. International career Cannon has played rugby at under-age level for England. He played for the England under-18 team while he was a student at Bishop Stopford School and won a European Championship with the side in 2006. Cannon was part of the England under-20 squad that won a Grand Slam in the 2008 Six Nations Under 20s Championship. Cannon made his debut for the under-20 side in the final game of the tournament against Ireland on the back of his performance for Northampton Saints in the National League 1. He was not named in the English squad for the 2008 Junior World Cup however. Cannon is also qualified to represent at international level.

In May 1645, Ming rebel leader Li Zicheng (Chinese: ÊùéËá™Êàê) was killed by a tuanlian of local landowners in Hubei province. During the Jiaqing reign, with the corrupt and ineffective official military establishment of the Eight Banners and Green Standard Army incapable of curbing the White Lotus Rebellion, the Qing court began to order local gentry and landowners in all ten provinces to organise tuanlian for self-defense, with both funding and control in the hands of local gentry and landowners. Yong Yong (Chinese:Âãá), literally \\"Braves\\", was the official name for members of the militia, which was recruited from the local civilian population. These \\"braves\\" were grouped into units (ying), known as the \\"Yong Ying\\". Yong were not regarded as part of the official imperial army of Eight Banners or Green Standard, with their funding and logistics provided by civilian society, not the imperial governments. The Xiang Army, a \\"Yung-ying\\" army in Qing Dynasty China, separate from the Manchu Eight Banners and Green Standard Army. They used modern weapons and the officers were never rotated, so relationships formed between officers and the troops, unlike Green Standard and Banner forces.Kwang-ching Liu, Richard J. Smith, \\"The Military Challenge: The North- west and the Coast,\\" in It was recorded that > Although rations came from public funds, the yung-ying troops were > nevertheless grateful to the officers of the battalion for selecting them to > be put on the rolls, as if they had received personal favours from the > officers. Since in ordinary times there existed [between the officers and > the troops] relations of kindness as well as mutual confidence, in battle it > could be expected that they would see each other through hardship and > adversity. Famous Yong Ying leadersZeng Guofan= During the Taiping Rebellion, tuanlian militia was expanded by Zeng Guofan into an army force of thirteen battalions consisted of 6500 men, a navy of ten battalions consisted of 5000 men, of a total of 17,000 men, was given the name of Xiang Army, with Zeng Guofan as the Commander-in-chief, accepting orders from Zeng alone. The new rule was termed \\"Soldiers followed the general, soldiers belonged to the general\\"(Chinese: ÂÖµÈö®Â∞áËΩâÔºåÂÖµÁÇ∫Â∞áÊúâ), contrary to the old military rule before the Northern Song Dynasty's \\"Soldiers had no fixed commander, commander had no fixed soldiers\\" (Chinese:ÂÖµÁÑ°Â∏∏Â∏•ÔºåÂ∏•ÁÑ°Â∏∏ÂÖµ). This new military rule was the direct cause of the Warlord era.

Developed as an enclosed mall in 1968, it was demolished and rebuilt in 2001 as a power center composed of big box tenants. Its anchor stores include Best Buy, DSW, Lowe's, Meijer, Michaels, Office Depot and PetSmart. The complex is owned and managed by Ramco- Gershenson Properties Trust, the same company that developed it. History Tel-Twelve Mall opened in 1968 along Telegraph Road just north of Interstate 696 in Southfield, Michigan. The mall initially comprised two anchor stores: Kmart at the northern end and Montgomery Ward at the southern end, with a Chatham supermarket as a junior anchor in between. It was designed by A&W; Properties (now Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust), with Charles N. Agree as architect. It originally featured a fountain and Astroturf floors. At the time of its opening, Tel-Twelve Mall's viability was questioned by retailers, as Southfield already had a larger shopping mall, Northland Center. Tel-Twelve was expanded four times in its history, eventually gaining a Crowley's department store as a third anchor in 1985, as well as a food court. By 1990, the mall had gained a Kids \\"R\\" Us, and Silver's Office Supplies had replaced the Chatham. In 1994, a renovation of the mall added many stores, including Ruby Tuesday, Old Country Buffet, DSW Shoe Warehouse, and Gap Warehouse, which later became Media Play. The Montgomery Ward store was downsized to make room for MC Sports and Office Depot, the former of which became Circuit City by 1996. Due to space limitations, a portion of the store had to be located across the mall hallway from the rest of the store. It was also the first Circuit City store to be located inside an enclosed shopping mall. Crowley's closed in 2000, followed by Montgomery Ward a year later. Although the mall was still 85% occupied at the time, its tenant roster was largely composed of local stores. Ramco-Gershenson had made a decision to demolish everything except for Kmart, Montgomery Ward, Office Depot, and Circuit City, and replace the rest of the complex with a strip mall. Kmart closed soon afterward, and its former location at the mall was demolished for a Meijer. The former Montgomery Ward was replaced with Michaels and Pier One, while other big box stores such as Lowe's supplanted the rest of the former enclosed mall space. DSW also relocated to a new store on the site of the mall. Media Play became Best Buy, while the former Circuit City slot eventually became a PetSmart. The Office Depot closed in 2019, and an Ulta Beauty store opened in its place by 2020.

Geography Lobo is located in the Trans-Pecos region of West Texas, between the Van Horn Mountains and Wylie Mountains in southern Culberson County. It is situated along U.S. Highway 90, about south of Van Horn and west of Valentine. History The community's history dates back to the mid-19th century, when a bolson aquifer named Van Horn Wells was discovered in the area. These wells were the only known water sources within a radius of . The springs became a stop on the San Antonio-El Paso Road, followed by emigrants travelling to the West. It was followed by the San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line and Butterfield Overland Mail and other mail routes from 1857 until the railroads arrived. In 1882, the area became a watering stop and depot for the Southern Pacific Railroad. A post office was established in 1907 under the name Lobo, after the Mexican wolves (Canis lupus baileyi) that formerly roamed the area. Two years later, a town site was laid out. With the creation of Culberson County in 1911, Lobo vied unsuccessfully with nearby Van Horn to become the new county's seat of government. By 1915, the community had a population around 20 with a general store and several other businesses. A 1929 earthquake destroyed Lobo's hotel. Another powerful earthquake struck the community in 1931. By the mid-1930s, the number of inhabitants had fallen to 10. The post office closed in 1942, but the arrival of the Texas Mica Company and two railroad houses caused a slight increase in the population. Large-scale irrigation commenced in the late 1940s and in the following years, cotton became an important crop in the local economy. Anderson, Clayton and Company set up a gin in Lobo, but in 1962, the railroad stop shut down. The population approached 90 by the mid-1960s. Around that time, the water table dropped dramatically and the wells were unable to supply enough water for residents and businesses. The cost of keeping the irrigation pumps operational skyrocketed, and the cotton gin shut down. In 1969, Bill Christ bought the entire community and opened a new gas station and a general store. Although business was initially good, the sale of alcoholic beverages caused an increase in crime. The store was destroyed by fire in 1976. In 1988, Christ placed the community on the market for $60,000. By 1991, with no purchaser and faced with personal problems, Christ abandoned his effort to save Lobo. It became a modern ghost town with limited water and an annual rainfall around per year. On November 5, 2001, three residents from Frankfurt, Germany, purchased Lobo. Their plans included fixing up dilapidated buildings and holding local arts and music festivals. The Desert Dust Cinema festival was held in Lobo in 2011, 2012,, 2016, and September 2018,[][] but no future dates are planned.

He fired a few shots in the air, before shooting indiscriminately at the people who were trying to seek refuge within the temple from the gunman. Though many initial news reports named 12 civilians killed, the official report states that only 11 people were shot to death and 19 others wounded by the more than 200 shots fired, before Thapa himself was killed. According to RNA statements, Thapa committed suicide, though many witnesses said that he was killed by one of his colleagues, while he was still firing at the villagers. An investigation of Thapa's body found that he died of a chest wound that could not possibly have been self-inflicted, thus contradicting the official version.Local fair turns into nightmare, People's Daily Online (December 16, 2005)Soldier kills 11 civilians in Nepal, Asian Tribune (December 16, 2005) Victims { style=\\"background-color: transparent; width: 100%\\"  width=\\"40%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Ram Lal Nagarkoti, 40 *Nani Nagarkoti, 19, daughter of Ram Lal Nagarkoti *Chola Kanta Panta *Sujan Shreshta  width=\\"25%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Aaite Tamang *Bhagwan Tamang *Dipak Tamang, 5 *Dhamai Singh Tamang, 11  width=\\"30%\\" align=\\"left\\" valign=\\"top\\"  *Kale Tamang *Maya Tamang *Niru Tamang } Aftermath The next day the RNA commenced to clean the crime scene, deliberately destroying evidence, presumably in an attempt to cover up the incident. When a second rifle was found in a pool about 60 metres away from Thapa's body, questions arose if there might have been a second gunman. In consequence human rights activists and opposition parties, as well as the people from Nagarkot demonstrated, demanding an impartial investigation and denouncing frequent human rights violations by and severe corruptness and indiscipline within the RNA. As a response the government formed a three-member judicial commission to investigate the incident and proposed to pay compensations of 150,000 Nepalese rupees to each of the victims families and to bear the expenses for treating the injured. Further the RNA also established a probe committee to scrutinise the massacre. The official report was released on January 3, 2006 and stated, that \\"Thapa committed suicide by shooting himself and no evidence was found of the involvement of any other person except Thapa in the incident\\". Further it was noted that Thapa had a history of indiscipline and obstructing work and that the leading officer of the Nagarkot barracks had failed to maintain discipline among his personnel.

The club colours are red, purple and black. History Athboy Rugby Football Club was founded in 1978 and the subsequent years have been tough but rewarding time for those who originally came together in the town with the idea of establishing the oval ball game in the area and indeed the many people who have come along since. Edmund Carroll from Athboy and local Vet Rafe Warner were both instrumental in the formation of the club which boasted, in its first year, one team and about a dozen alickadoos, The initial season of 1978‚Äì79 constituted a series of friendlies but in the summer of 1979 the club was officially affiliated to the Leinster Branch of the IRFU. Since its establishment, the club has had its ups and downs, coming from small beginnings to grow into a progressive unit playing at both Junior 3 and 4 level. In the 1995‚Äì96 season when the club failed to field a team for the first time since 1978, senior rugby activity was suspended. In the 1999‚Äì2000 season, sufficient numbers of players and interest resulted in a re-launch at J3 level and the addition of a women's team, later in that season. Success on the field has brought home 5 trophies, those 5 triumphs ‚Äì 4 in the Magee Cup (North-East J3 League) 1987,1988 & 1990 and 2010 and the Michael Dunne Cup (Provincial J4) in 1982. Playing as a Junior 4 side the club only had to wait 3 seasons before bringing home the first trophy home to the Bawn Inn where the club was then based. It may have taken a replay to see off Kilkenny in the Dunne Cup Final but the 10‚Äì6 victory was a great boost for a fledgling club and the Jimmy McCann led XV was toasted at many celebrations in the following weeks. With growing success in area and provincial rugby the club sought and was granted by the Leinster Branch a move up to Junior 3 in 1982. A second XV was started and the club boasted up to 40 players and several officials. With the club finding success on the field the decision was taken to locate to a new home and this was achieved when land was acquired on the edge of the town . The 2 teams began playing there in 1986 and over ¬£2000 was spent installing floodlights for training. The Clubs 1stXV currently play in Division 2b of the Leinster League In the summer of 1999 a meeting was held with the aim of fielding again at senior level this was achieved with a mixture of players who had played both at senior and underage level for the club plus several who had moved into the area and a few new recruits to the oval ball. As with the first team the new team spent its first year playing friendlies and in the 2000‚Äì01 season played in the Provincial Thirds League, The Anderson Cup and the Dunne Cup. The Women's team was also started in 1999‚Äì00 season playing a number of friendlies and played in the National Conference in 2000‚Äì01 In 2001-2002 season the women's XV shared the All Ireland League Division 3 title with Trinity College and the following year lost out in an all Meath final against Navan Since 1985 Athboy has had fielded under 10's and 12 teams and this has grown to include under 8's under 14's,16's and in 03/04 an Under 18's (in conjunction with Ardee) The 18's went on to win leinster Under 18's Division 1 the same season. Several players have gone on to represent Leinster at several levels including U17, U18, Women's U19, Women's Leinster B and the Senior Leinster Women's Team also former player Richie Feeney (now UL Bohs) made his Ireland U19 debut V England in 2004. The membership of the club reflects a broad level of interest in rugby throughout the area with players from Athboy, Trim and other parts of South Meath.

It is believed to be responsible for the numbing and tingling sensation caused by eating food cooked with Sichuan peppercorns and Uzazi. The term sanshool in the compound's name is derived from the Japanese term for the Sichuan pepper, (literally, mountain pepper), to which was appended the suffix -ol, indicating an alcohol. Mechanism The chemical structure of hydroxy- alpha sanshool is similar to that of capsaicin, but the mechanism of action by which it induces nerve sensations has been a matter of debate. Although the compound is an agonist at the pain integration channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 like capsaicin, newer evidence suggests that the tandem pore domain potassium channels KCNK3, KCNK9, and KCNK18 are primarily responsible for sanshool's effects. Hydroxy-alpha sanshool excites D-hair afferent nerve fibers, a distinct subset of the sensitive light touch receptors in the skin, and targets novel populations of AŒ≤ and C-fiber nerve fibers.  Extraction  To isolate the molecule from the pepper in form of an extract, steam distillation can be used: Dried peels of the fruit are immersed in a mixture of lower alcohols (for example ethanol) and water with a mass percentage between 35-65% of the alcohol. The solution gets heated up in the process of steam distillation where the aqueous part evaporates and takes parts of the hydroxy- alpha- sanshool up, too. The distillate separates in two phases: the aqueous ethanol phase and the oil phase which contains the desired molecule. A problem with this extraction method is the low yield which is most times below 60%.

Biography Morgan served as Ginsberg's personal archivist and bibliographer from the early-'80s until the author's death from cancer in 1997. Over their 20-year professional relationship, Morgan became quite close to Ginsberg, and has written extensively on the Beat Generation and its key figures. Bill Morgan's interest in the Beats goes back to the early 1970s, when he was attending school at the University of Pittsburgh. For his master's degree thesis, he compiled a bibliography of the works of Lawrence Ferlinghetti, poet and owner of City Lights Books, the famous San Francisco bookstore and one of the most important publishers of the early Beat writers, most notably Allen Ginsberg. After finishing his thesis, Morgan was encouraged by the editors at the University of Pittsburgh Press to pursue this project with a view toward eventual publication. He did indeed continue his research, working in close collaboration with Ferlinghetti as his personal bibliographer, and, after a decade of research, he published Lawrence Ferlinghetti: A Comprehensive Bibliography (New York: Garland Publishing, 1982). By 1980 Morgan had moved to New York City. While he was still working on the Ferlinghetti book, the San Francisco poet had referred him to Allen Ginsberg, whose own personal library and archive were invaluable sources of information on the Beats. Early consultations with the poet grew into an enduring relationship that lasted from the early 1980s until Ginsberg's death in 1997. During these years Morgan served as Ginsberg's archivist and bibliographer, helping the poet to organize and maintain his ever-increasing library and records. As Ginsberg's bibliographer, Morgan spent fifteen years corresponding with and visiting numerous publishers, editors, scholars, and library collections in order to gather sufficient information to document the history of Ginsberg's prodigious output and the worldwide attention it has drawn. The results of his research appeared in a two-volume bibliography: The Works of Allen Ginsberg, 1941-1994: A Descriptive Bibliography and The Response to Allen Ginsberg, 1926-1994: A Bibliography of Secondary Sources (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1995, 1997). In 2006, Morgan published I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg (New York: Viking, 2006). He followed that in 2010 with The Typewriter Is Holy: The Complete, Uncensored History of the Beat Generation (New York, NY: Free Press, 2010). Morgan has also authored or edited a half- dozen other works relating to the Beats, including collections of Ginsberg's essays (Deliberate Prose: Selected Essays, 1952‚Äì1995, New York: HarperCollins, 2000), of the poet's last poems (Death & Fame: Poems, 1993-1997; coedited with Bob Rosenthal and Peter Hale, New York: HarperFlamingo, 1999), and of Gregory Corso's correspondence (An Accidental Autobiography: The Selected Letters of Gregory Corso, New York: New Directions, 2003). Through City Lights in San Francisco, he has published two guides, The Beat Generation in New York: A Walking Tour of Jack Kerouac's City (1997) and The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour (2003). The latter appeared during the fiftieth anniversary celebration of City Lights, to which Morgan also contributed with a series of free walking tours of the North Beach section of San Francisco, once a center of bohemian life in the city and home for many of the Beats in the 1950s and 1960s. In the course of his decades of research on the Beats, Morgan gathered perhaps the largest private collections of printed works by and about Ferlinghetti and Ginsberg in private hands. He found it increasingly difficult to maintain these two very large and valuable collections in his New York apartment, and reluctantly decided to part with them. Knowing that Ferlinghetti was a UNC-Chapel Hill alumnus, he decided in the fall of 2001 to offer his collection of the San Francisco poet to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill libraries. Discussions with library officials led to the transfer of the collection to Chapel Hill in December of that year, partly as sale and partly as gift. Pleased with the outcome, Morgan then offered a similar arrangement for his even more extensive Allen Ginsberg collection. The materials were delivered to the Rare Book Collection in Wilson Library in August 2002.http://www.lib.unc.edu/rbc/beats/morgan.html Major works *The Beat Generation in New York: A Walking Tour of Jack Kerouac's City (City Lights, 1997). *The Beat Generation in San Francisco: A Literary Tour.

The church building is located on the corner of Bredisholm Road and Muirhead Road, Baillieston, Glasgow, Scotland. The church today serves the town of Baillieston. History The congregation of Baillieston St Andrew's was established in November 1966, by the union of the Baillieston Old Parish and Rhinsdale Churches. =Baillieston Parish Church= The origins of Baillieston Parish Church go back to the late 1820s when George Scott of Daldowie donated a site on Crosshill Farm for the building of a church, to be known as the Crosshill Chapel of Ease, and provision of a cemetery for the village.Baillieston: Old Parish Church (Crosshill Church): an indexed record of information on gravestones, Jenny Gilmour, Glasgow & West of Scotland Family History Society Plans were prepared and building proceeded; the first church in Scotland under the First Church Extension Scheme of the Church of Scotland. The church in Church Street, Crosshill (now closed) only cost ¬£507 to build and was opened on 7 July 1833 with seating for 500. Prior to this the only church in the area was Old Monklands Parish Church.Old Baillieston, Garrowhill and Easterhouse, Rhona Wilson, Stenlake Publishing The first minister was the Rev. Andrew Gray who as a probationer of the Church also taught in the local school. He remained as minister until the Disruption in 1843 when he was called to be minister at Dumbarton. Over the next 123 years Baillieston Parish Church had a further six ministers until the union with Rhinsdale Church in 1966. In June 1967 Rev. John J.C. Owen, took up his first charge at Baillieston Old Parish Church where he remained until December 1979, a period of twelve years. During his ministry a fund for the building of a new church was started and with the generosity of the congregation and members of the public, sufficient money was collected over some years to allow the building of the new church to proceed.Baillieston Is Beautiful - So It Is, Scots Magazine, December 1980, Elizabeth Sutherland The \\"Old Church\\" had served its purpose well, having been in constant use for about 140 years, but was now in need of almost continual and costly maintenance. This, coupled with the closure of Rhinsdale Church whose congregation had united with the \\"Old Church\\" in November 1966 causing a very considerable increase in its membership, made it necessary to build a new church.My Ain Folk - History of Baillieston and District, Stewart Jackson, 1981 =Baillieston Parish Church War Memorial= The War Memorial to those who had fallen in the 1914-18 war was extended to include the names of those who gave their lives in the 2nd World War, 1939‚Äì45, and on Sunday, 15 April 1951 an Unveiling and Dedication Service was held. The Rev. Roy McVicar officiated. The memorial was unveiled by William Reid (VC). who also gave the address to a very full church. Other gifts were given by members of the congregation and these included a full suite of chairs for the choir along with a special chair in keeping with the design of the Communion chairs as a memorial. =Rhinsdale Parish Church= Rhinsdale Church, originally known in Baillieston as the U.P. Kirk (United Presbyterian) was first started by a number of people from Baillieston and district in March 1862. They met for services at school building at Fauldshill known as a preaching U.P. Church, getting their preachers from the U.P. Presbytery of Glasgow. James Hunter, a Glasgow merchant, who lived in Rhinsdale House then, and in all probability owned Fauldshill where the old school stood, was one who was responsible for the beginning of the congregation. While the early members were using the school they resolved to have a church of their own and began to collect subscriptions for this purpose. In due course, with their subscriptions, plus assistance from the U.P. Building Fund and the Ferguson Bequest Fund, they had a total of ¬£1,200. A site which latterly became well known in Baillieston was chosen. It was given to the church by James Beaumont Neilson, the inventor of hot blast which revolutionised iron smelting in Coatbridge in the 1830s. By October 1863 construction of the buildings was well ahead so the members, 81 of them, petitioned the Glasgow Presbytery of the U. P. Church for permission to form a congregation of the U.P. Church in Baillieston. This was granted and in January 1864 the U.P. Church in Baillieston was born. It was opened for worship on 17 February 1864. The new buildings were the church and at the rear the Session House and Vestry and above a small hail. It was almost five months later before the new congregation called its first minister. He was the Rev. John Mcintyre and he was ordained on 1 June 1865. Over the next 100 years Rhinsdale Church had a further eight ministers until the union with Baillieston Old Parish Church in 1966. Rhinsdale Church War Memorial: Many men from the Rhinsdale congregation saw active service, sixteen of them being killed in action. Their names were inscribed on a memorial plaque incorporated in the Communion Table. The new church The congregation of Baillieston St Andrew's was established in November 1966, by the union of the Baillieston Old and Rhinsdale Churches. The new congregation appointed its first minister, the Rev John Owen in June 1967. During the first seven years of his ministry the Rev Owen worked with his congregation to plan and oversee the building of a new church building to replace the \\"Old\\" parish church. The new church was dedicated in December 1974.An Account of the building of Baillieston St Andrew's Church, 1968-1974, Rev J.J.C.

A ;Acetaldehyde : The main aldehyde found in wines, most notably Sherry. ;Acetic acid : One of the primary volatile acids in wine. ;Acetification : The process through which acetic acid is produced in wine. ;Acetobacter : A bacterium found in wine that causes acetification resulting in the conversion of wine to vinegar. ;Acidity : The quality of wine that gives it its crispiness and vitality. A proper balance of acidity must be struck with the other elements of a wine, or else the wine may be said to be too sharp ‚Äì having disproportionately high levels of acidity ‚Äì or too flat ‚Äì having disproportionately low levels of acidity. The three main acids found in wine are tartaric acid, malic acid and lactic acid. The first two come from the grapes and the third from Malolactic fermentation which often occurs in the winemaking process. ;Active acidity :The concentration of acids in the wine with positively charged hydrogen ions. Used to gauge the \\"total acidity\\" in the wine. Measured using the pH scale. ; Actual alcohol :The amount of ethanol present in wine, usually measured as a percent of total volume (ABV) taken at 20¬∞C ;Aerobic conditions :Winemaking conditions that promote exposure to oxygen, such wine barrels kept partially full in order to oxidatively age the wine Aging barrels ;Aging barrel : A barrel, often made of oak, used to age wine or distilled spirits. ;Alcohol : Generally refers to ethanol, a chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages. It is also commonly used to refer to alcoholic beverages in general. ; Alcoholic fermentation : The conversion by yeast of sugar into alcohol compounds ;Aldehyde : A component of wine that is formed during the oxidation of alcohol. It is midway between an acid and an alcohol. ;Alternative wine closures : Various substitutes used in the wine industry for sealing wine bottles in place of traditional cork closures. ;Amino acids : Protein found in wine grapes that are formed by fruit esters and consumed during the fermentation process and/or autolysis. They contribute to the sense of complexity in a wine. ;Amphora : A type of ceramic vase, used for transporting and storing wine in ancient times. ;Anaerobic : The opposite of aerobic, referring to a chemical process that takes place in the absence of oxygen. As a wine ages in a sealed wine bottle, it is going through anaerobic changes. ; Analyzer :The first column in a Coffey still, outlawed for the production of Cognac but can be used in other regions for wine-based spirits, where the pre-heated wash is vaporized by steam ;Angel's share : The portion of a wine in an aging barrel that is lost to evaporation. ; Anreicherung : German winemaking term for must enrichment ;Anthocyanin : Phenolic pigments that give red wine its color. ;Antioxidant : Chemicals, such as sulfur dioxide, that are used to prevent the grape must from oxidizing. ;Aromatized wine : A wine that has been flavored with herbs, fruit, flowers and spices.

The average internal pressure inside a bottle of sparkling wine is 6 atmospheres. ;Autolysis : The breakdown of dead yeast cells (or lees) and the process through which desirable or undesirable traits maybe imparted to the wine. Wines that are deliberately aged sur lie such as Muscadet or some white Burgundies derive certain flavors and textures from this process. B ;Back-Blend : Blending unfermented, fresh grape juice into a fully fermented wine in order to add sweetness. Synonymous with the German winemaking technique Sussreserve. ;Barrel fermented : A wine fermented in oak barrels as opposed to stainless steel or concrete. Traditional with white Burgundies, some Chardonnays and some Champagne. ; Barrique : French term for a 225 liter cask that is traditionally used in Bordeaux and now adopted worldwide ;Baum√© : French measurement of the sugar concentration in the juice or wine. ;Beeswing : A light sediment, chiefly mucilage, found in Port. ;Bentonite : A type of clay of volcanic origins used in wine as a clarifying agent. ;Blanc de Blancs : A white wine, usually sparkling, made exclusively from white grapes, often Chardonnay. ;Blanc de Noirs : A white wine, usually sparkling, made from red grapes. ;Blending : The mixing of two or more different parcels of wine together by winemakers to produce a consistent finished wine that is ready for bottling. Laws generally dictate what wines can be blended together, and what is subsequently printed on the wine label. ; Blue fining : The use of potassium ferrocyanide to remove iron or copper casse from a wine ;Blush wine : A pale, pinkish color wine. It may refer to a sweet ros√© such as White Zinfandel. ; Bonne chauffe : The second distillation that takes place during Cognac production where the cloudy brouillis (first distillate with alcohol levels between 28-32%) gets converted into the clear eau de vie ;Botrytized grapes : Grapes that have been rotted by botrytis cinerea. ; Botte (plural botti) :Italian term for a very large barrel that can hold up to ; Bottiglia : Italian term for a wine bottle ;Bottle Age : The length of time that wine has been allowed to age and mature in bottle. ;Bottle shock : Also known as bottle-sickness, a temporary condition of wine characterized by muted or disjointed fruit flavors. It often occurs immediately after bottling or when wines (usually fragile wines) are shaken in travel. After several days the condition usually disappears. ;Bottle variation : The degree to which bottled wine of the same style and vintage can vary. ;Box wine : Wine packaged in a bag usually made of flexible plastic and protected by a box, usually made of cardboard. The bag is sealed by a simple plastic tap. ;Brettanomyces : A wine spoilage yeast that produces taints in wine commonly described as barnyard or band-aids. ;Brix/Balling : A measurement of the dissolved sucrose level in a wine ; Brouillis : The product of the first distillation in the production of Cognac ;Brut : A French term for a very dry Champagne or sparkling wine. Drier than extra dry. ;Bung : A stopper used to seal a bottle or barrel. Commonly used term for corks. ;Burnt wine : Another name for Brandy, a liquor made from distilled wine.

In Sherry production, a butt traditionally holds around C ;Cap: The layer of grape skins that are forced by rising carbon dioxide gas to the top of the fermentation vessel during cuvaison. ;Carbonic acid: Carbon dioxide gas dissolved in the water content of wine. It is a volatile acid that held in equilibrium with the dissolved carbon dioxide gas and can not be isolated in a pure form. ;Carbonic gas: A natural by product of the fermentation process in which yeast cells convert sugar into nearly equal parts alcohol and carbonic gas. While a small amount stays presence in the wine as carbonic acid, most of the gas will rise to the surface of the fermentation vessel and attempt to escape into the air. If the fermentation vessel is closed (such as a sealed wine bottle used to make sparkling wine), the gas will dissolve into the wine and when released will make the wine sparkling. ;Carbonic maceration: A winemaking practice of fermenting whole grapes that have not been crushed.

It is the closest settlement to the headquarters of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, which contains Guadalupe Peak, the highest point in the state of Texas. Pine Springs is located on U.S. Routes 62 and 180. The last population read 51 residents.Pine Springs at Lonestar.net ClimateOverview= Pine Springs experiences a semi-arid climate with hot summers and cool winters. Pine Springs is located at the base of the Guadalupe Mountains, at a higher elevation than most of the Chihuahuan Desert. As a result, Pine Springs is substantially cooler and receives more precipitation than the vast majority of the desert. Due to Pine Springs' elevation and aridity, temperatures drop sharply after sunset. Most precipitation falls in the summer and early fall, as thunderstorms sweep across the desert. Bitterly cold temperatures close to zero are rare, but can occur in winter months. =Spring= Temperatures and the likelihood of precipitation both tend to increase as Spring progresses. Rapid and substantial swings in temperature, associated with wind shifts and the passage of weather fronts, are common through the Spring, with hot daytime temperatures possible as early as the month of March, and freezing cold nighttime temperatures possible as late as the month of May. =Summer= In late May or early June, the weather stabilizes for the summer, and remains so until the passage of the first cold front, usually in September. Most precipitation occurs in the summer months, in the form of fast moving and short lived thunderstorms. Days are dry and hot, although temperatures are not as extreme as in the lower areas of the Chihuahuan Desert. Summer nights are comfortably cool, and cool breezes often gently blow across the desert after dark. =Fall= Fall begins with the passage of the first cold front from the north, often in late September or early October. After the last of the summer thunderstorms, usually in August or September, fall is dry. As the season progresses, the weather alternates between warm periods where the wind is predominately from the south, and cold periods of increasing severity as cold fronts move down from the north. The first frost may be as early as late September, or as late as early December. =Winter= Winter consists of alternating periods of warm and cold weather. Winter days are usually mild, sometimes even warm, but nighttime temperatures often fall below freezing. Due to Pine Springs' low latitude, prolonged, severe cold is rare. While the day and night after the passage of a strong cold front from the north might see bitterly cold weather, temperatures rapidly warm afterwards. Light snowfall after the passage of a strong cold front is occasional during winter months, but snow usually melts quickly. Heavy snowfall is extremely rare in Pine Springs.

Dave Mattacks and Steve Peer (drums) both had brief stints in the band.  History  Nelson formed Red Noise after dissolving Be-Bop Deluxe, while metamorphosing from blues, progressive and glam rock to more new wave and electronic sounds following the last Be-Bop Deluxe album Drastic Plastic, released early 1978. EMI's Harvest Records subsidiary, to whom Be-Bop had been contracted, insisted on his name being added ‚Äì hence Bill Nelson's Red Noise. Clark had also been a member of Be-Bop Deluxe, while Ian Nelson had collaborated on the song (and hit single) \\"Ships in the Night\\" from the Sunburst Finish album (1976). Peer was previously in TV Toy, only joining the band for touring purposes after the album had been recorded (he can be heard on a number of Red Noise live and Bill Nelson-credited B-side studio tracks plus the one Red Noise-credited track on Nelson's later Quit Dreaming And Get on the Beam). In the studio, Nelson recorded most of the drum parts himself, hiring former Fairport Convention drummer Dave Mattacks for more complex tracks. Red Noise released only one album, Sound-on-Sound, plus two singles, \\"Furniture Music\\" and \\"Revolt into Style\\", in February and April 1979. After that, Bill Nelson continued as a solo artist, with Ian frequently collaborating on his brother's recordings throughout the eighties. Clark would later appear, among other places, on \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" and other tracks on David Bowie's Scary Monsters (1980), and \\"Big Time\\" and \\"Don't Give Up\\" on Peter Gabriel's So (1986). Rick Ford played with Hazel O'Connor and Joe Jackson and now composes soundtrack music for the entertainment industry in California, while Steve Peer returned to work with TV Toy. In the early '80's he formed Custom Made Country, a cow-punk band that hailed from the easternmost town in the USA, Lubec, Maine. While in Maine he started Reversing Recordings, a label that features Down East musicians and most anyone else who wants to align with the Vacationland movement. He co-wrote and played drums on two Puzzle Monkey albums, and continues to tour and record with Trisha Mason, The Larks and Doug Hoyt and The Crown Vics. Red Noise is also considered by some Be-Bop fans as a Be-Bop Deluxe continuation because of Sound-on-Sound similarity to the emerging electronic character of Be-Bop's final studio album, Drastic Plastic, released the previous year. An interview with Bill Nelson in 1979 hints that several of the songs in Sound-on-Sound were written during his Be-Bop Deluxe days and might have been included in any Be-Bop album subsequent to Drastic Plastic had that band remained together. However, Nelson also makes clear that he regarded Red Noise as an escape from Be-Bop Deluxe rather than its continuation: \\"Drastic Plastic was the last-ditch attempt to get the band to change a bit but it was difficult for people to accept.\\" Touring England to promote the album, Red Noise performed a Be-Bop song from Drastic Plastic, \\"Possession.\\" In a 1984 interview, Nelson revealed that he had recorded a second Red Noise album immediately after Sound-on-Sound but that his record company Harvest Records didn't like it: \\"EMI wouldn't release it, and it sat on the shelf.\\" Nelson's manager eventually purchased some of the unreleased songs back from EMI so that Nelson could release them as a solo artist under his own label, Cocteau Records. One of these was \\"Do You Dream in Colour\\", which received generous radio airplay and press coverage for its original music video. This track and one on the B-side featured all vocals and instruments by Nelson himself apart from sax by Ian Nelson. Two other tracks, \\"Ideal Homes\\" and \\"Instantly Yours\\", featured the Nelson/Nelson/Ford/Clark/Peer line-up. This release attracted the attention of Phonogram, who secured the remaining tracks for Cocteau to release the full album, Quit Dreaming And Get on the Beam, credited simply to Bill Nelson, on their subsidiary label Mercury Records in 1981. Red Noise had not been originally intended as a band so much as a name under which Nelson could bring in musicians as required without being tied down to a fixed band line-up. However, the commercial pressures of the music business meant that it didn't work out that way. Where only one track on Quit Dreaming was credited to Red Noise, it clearly referred to the band: \\"Disposable\\" featured the Bill Nelson/Ford/Clark/Peer line-up. Many other tracks featured both Bill and Ian Nelson. The Sound-on-Sound album title inspired the publishers of Sound on Sound to name their magazine after it. Harvest's 2012 CD reissue of Sound-on- Sound contained not only tracks from single B-sides previously unreleased on that format, but also a BBC Radio 1 Friday Rock Show session from 17 February 1979 previously unreleased on any format.

Lying four miles (6 km) west of the town of Chloride, Grasshopper Junction provides access to a lone surviving mining camp along County Road 125. The area features the Grasshopper Junction restaurant as a roadside attraction. History The \\"Smoky\\" shot of Operation Plumbbob In January 1951, the United States government established the Nevada Test Site, a nuclear weapons testing reservation located in Nye County, Nevada, about 180 miles (290 km) northwest Grasshopper Junction. During the 1950s, the mushroom cloud from these tests could be seen for almost in either direction, including in the city of Las Vegas where the tests became tourist attractions. Between May 28 and October 7, 1957, the Nevada Test Site ran a series of nuclear tests called Operation Plumbbob. In 1958, the site carried out low-yield atmospheric and underground tests identified as Operation Hardtack II. As a result of Operation Plumbbob and Operation Hardtack, Grasshopper Junction became part of the June 22-26, 1959 hearings before the Special Subcommittee on Radiation of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. At the time, the population of Grasshopper Junction was two, and the first session of the 86th United States Congress determined that the estimated radiation dose received by the Grasshopper Junction population was 0.03 roentgen (8 microcoulombs per kilogram) before Operation Plumbbob (Pre-Plumbbob) and 0.03 roentgen (8 ¬µC/kg) after Operation Hardtack II (Cumulative). 2007 photo of the Mini Mart at Grasshopper Junction, Arizona In December 1975, a marker was erected across from Grasshopper Junction to honor the bicentennial of Chloride. 2006 United States Geological Survey of the depth to water and water-level altitude in Grasshopper Junction, Arizona From 1988 to 1991, Grasshopper Junction had a population of six, which included Dean Morrison and Jackie Appelhans as co- owners of a store and restaurant and their four children. Although their children had moved away by 1991, they were included in the population count. In May 1991, both Morrison (age 65) and Appelhans (age 60) were found murdered in their home. Brothers Robert and Roger Murray were each convicted on June 12, 1992 of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of armed robbery, and were sentenced to death. In October 1995, the sentencing was affirmed by the Arizona Supreme Court. In May 2008, Roger Murray's petition for writ of habeas corpus was denied.Murray v. Schriro, May 30, 2008, United States District Court Arizona, No. CV-03-775-PHX-DGC In July 2005, the Twin Mills wildfire was ignited by lightning and burned Grasshopper Junction, which received air drops of flame retardant. In a 2006 United States Geological Survey survey of the depth to water and water-level altitude in Arizona, the younger alluvium surficial deposits atop Grasshopper Junction were viewed as ranging from unconsolidated to strongly consolidated alluvial deposits. Residing in the Detrital basin, the ground water in Grasshopper Junction is contained in a basin-fill aquifer and other water-bearing sediments at a depth of approximately below the land surface. Additionally, the underground water level resides approximately at an altitude of 3700 feet (1130 m) above mean sea level and is moving directly South.
