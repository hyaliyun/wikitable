In addition to his pioneering air and space efforts, he is often cited as an example of Canadian brain drain to the U.S. In the early 1960s, he was one of the key people that proposed and moved that Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) was the best option for landing a crew on the Moon, the method eventually used on Apollo lunar landing missions. He left NASA in 1970 and worked for McDonnell Douglas, in their Houston offices, until his death in 1981. Early life Chamberlin was born in Kamloops, British Columbia on May 23, 1915, the son of Walter Chamberlin and Theresa Goldie. His father was killed at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, in 1917. Having maintained a keen interest in model aircraft during high school at the University of Toronto Schools, he took mechanical engineering degrees at the University of Toronto (1936) and Imperial College London (1939). Career Chamberlin began his engineering career with the British aircraft company (and later ejection seat manufacturers) Martin-Baker before returning to Canada. He worked on the production of the British Avro Anson at Federal Aircraft Ltd. in Montreal (1940–1941), and later, on training and anti-submarine aircraft as chief engineer at Clarke Ruse Aircraft in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia (1941–1942). His longest tenure began as a research engineer (1942–1945) at Noorduyn Aircraft in Montreal, working on the Norseman and serving in this position until the end of the Second World War. =Avro Canada= In February 1946, Chamberlin joined Avro Aircraft Ltd. in Toronto, the Canadian subsidiary of the British Avro, itself part of the Hawker Siddeley Group, where Chamberlin was chief aerodynamicist on the C102 Jetliner and CF-100 Canuck jet interceptor. Later, as chief of technical design for the CF-105 Avro Arrow jet interceptor, he generated many of the ideas that would make the design famous.Gainor 2001, pp. 19-33. Jim Chamberlin in the Gemini Project Manager's Office, Houston, 1962 =NASA= Following the Canadian government's cancellation of the Avro Arrow project in 1959, Chamberlin led a team of 25 engineers from Avro who joined NASA's Space Task Group. This group eventually grew to 32 former Avro engineers, collectively known as the \\"Avro Group\\", who joined NASA and become emblematic of what many Canadians viewed as a brain drain to the United States.McArthur, Scott. \\"James Arthur Chamberlin, 1915–1981.\\" Arrow Digital Archives: Arrow Recovery Canada. Retrieved: January 4, 2013. As head of engineering for Project Mercury, chief designer and NASA's first Project Manager for the Gemini spacecraft built by McDonnell Aircraft, and then troubleshooter on Apollo, Chamberlin played an instrumental role in creating and implementing the first three generations of American crewed spacecraft. Chamberlin was chiefly responsible for designing the Gemini spacecraft and was the first Project Manager for Gemini (Gemini 7 shown in a photo from Gemini 6 on December 15, 1965). While designing the Gemini spacecraft in 1961, Chamberlin proposed that Gemini be paired with a \\"bug\\" that would land a single astronaut on the Moon. Chamberlin had been impressed with NASA engineer John Houbolt's advocacy of Lunar orbit rendezvous as the method to go to the Moon. Although Chamberlin's idea of flying Gemini to the Moon was rejected, it helped lead NASA to its decision in 1962 to use Lunar Orbit Rendezvous in the Apollo program, which involved using the Lunar Module (LM) to descend to the lunar surface.Hansen, James R. \\"Enchanted Rendezvous: John Houbolt and the Genesis of the Lunar-Orbit Rendezvous Concept.\\" NASA-TM-111236: Monographs in Aerospace History Series #4, NASA, December 1995. Retrieved: August 13, 2011. Chamberlin was described by space historian David Baker as \\"probably one of the most brilliant men ever to work for NASA.\\"Baker 1982, p. 182. Chamberlin left NASA in 1970 to join McDonnell Douglas Astronautics, where he prepared an ultimately unsuccessful space shuttle bid before becoming technical director for the company's facility at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, a position he held until his death on March 8, 1981. He and his wife had a son and a daughter. Honors NASA awarded Chamberlin its Exceptional Scientific Achievement, Exceptional Service and Exceptional Engineering Achievement medals. Chamberlin was a Professional Engineer of the Province of Ontario, a member of the Institute of Aeronautical Scientists and an Associate Fellow of the Canadian Aeronautical Institute. The minor planet 14148 Jimchamberlin, discovered at Kitt Peak National Observatory in 1998, is named in his honor. In 2001, he was inducted into Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame.\\"James Arthur Chamberlin.\\" Canada's Aviation Hall of Fame. Retrieved: January 4, 2013.

The capital of Latvia, Riga, is situated in the southwestern part of the region. Population: around 1.3 million (year?). Literally meaning \\"the Middle Land\\", it is situated in north- central Latvia north of the Daugava River. Sometimes in German, it is also known as Livland, the German form from Latin Livonia, though it comprises only a small part of Medieval Livonia and about half (the Latvian part) of Swedish Livonia. Vidzemes guberņa – Livland Governorate is also bigger than Vidzeme, since it corresponds roughly to Swedish Livonia. History In ancient times the territory of Vidzeme was inhabited by Latgalians and Livs (near the coast of the Gulf of Riga and along the lower reaches of the Daugava and Gauja rivers). Until the German conquest in the 13th century the Daugava, which now forms the south-east border of Vidzeme, was the boundary between the lands of the Livs and Latgalians on the right bank and those of the Semigallians and Selonians on the left bank of the river. The most notable Latgalian region in today’s Vidzeme was Tālava. After the Livonian War part of the Livonian Confederation on the right bank of the Daugava river and the Patrimony of Riga was ceded to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and the Duchy of Livonia (the left bank forming the Duchy of Courland and Semigalia). After the Polish- Swedish War concluded by the Truce of Altmark in 1629 Sweden acquired the western part of the Duchy of Livonia roughly as far as the Aiviekste River, since then forming Vidzeme's eastern border. During the course of the Great Northern War Swedish Livonia was conquered by the Russian Empire and ceded to Russia at the Treaty of Nystad in 1721. In place of Livonia the Russians created the Riga Governorate, but in 1796 the Riga Governorate was renamed the Governorate of Livonia (, , Russian: Лифляндская губерния / Liflyandskaya guberniya, ), administered autonomously by the local German Baltic nobility through a feudal . After the end of World War I it was split between the newly independent countries of Latvia and Estonia. Historical regions of Latvia, together with Latvian cultural groups.

A portion of the Florida Canal in back of Arabi. On the back side of the canal the levee and floodwall can be seen. The canal was built in the 18th century colonial era of Louisiana, stretching from what is now the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans, roughly paralleling the Mississippi River on the East Bank down through modern Saint Bernard Parish and part of the East Bank of Plaquemines. Colonial land grants commonly stretched 40 arpents back from the Mississippi River. The canal thus marked the back end of properties, mostly originally plantations. In this area this line happened to generally be about the limit of land useful for cultivation where the higher land of the natural river levee ended in swamp. The \\"40 Arpent Canal\\" was used by small vessels for commerce between nearby plantations; larger vessels and longer range shipping used the Mississippi. The earth moved to dig the canal was used to create a raised roadway on the river side of the canal, called the \\"Florida Walk\\". With development and the construction of additional perpendicular canals in the 19th and 20th century, the old 40 Arpent Canal was divided into several discontinuous canals. Florida Walk became Florida Avenue, although discontinued in some areas either by being developed over or being allowed to fall back into wilderness. In some places such as New Orleans the remaining pieces of the canal became known as the \\"Florida Canal\\", while in parts of Saint Bernard and Plaquemines the old \\"40 Arpent Canal\\" name is still used. No longer used for shipping, the canal is still used for drainage, and in places some small pleasure and fishing boats. Down river from the Industrial Canal, the Florida Canal still marks the inland boundary of the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood of New Orleans and communities such as Arabi and Chalmette. Levees and floodwalls constructed on the back side of the canal help protect settled areas from flooding. These levees in back of the canal were overtopped by storm surges during Hurricane Katrina in 2005; to do this the storm surge needed to first top the larger levees abutting the MR-GO and travel through the wetlands between MR-GO and the 40 Arpent Canal back levee. In December 2005 it was announced that in Saint Bernard Parish the 40 Arpent Canal back levee would be increased in height to help offer some temporary protection until more comprehensive work could be done on MR-GO.

Biography =Early career= Rhind was born in New York City, New York, the son of Charles Rhind, a prominent shipowner who also served as Minister to Turkey from 1827. His mother, Susan Fell, was a descendant of Cadwallader Colden, the Governor of the colonial Province of New York from 1769 to 1771. Rhind was appointed midshipman on September 3, 1838, and between 1839 and 1841 he served on the Mediterranean Station aboard the frigate and the sloop . He then served aboard the sloop in the West Indies in 1842-43, then on the frigate off the coast of Africa in 1843-44, before attending the Philadelphia Naval School in 1844-45. Promoted to passed midshipman on July 2, 1845, Rhind served on the brig on the Coast Survey in 1845-46, which was then attached the Home Squadron on the coast of Mexico during the Mexican–American War, being present at Alvarado and Tabasco. Rhind served on the steamer in 1848, before rejoining the Coast Survey aboard the schooner Ewing on a voyage to the coast of California in 1849-50. He then served aboard the sloop in the East Indies in 1850-51, before returning to the Coast Survey, where he remained until 1854, receiving promotion to the rank of master on April 30, 1853. Rhind was commissioned as a lieutenant on February 17, 1854, and served on the sloop on the Pacific Station, but in May 1855 was court-martialed after a disagreement with his commander, and left the Navy in September 1855. Eventually reinstated, Rhind served on the sloop , the flagship of the Africa Squadron from 1859-61. =Civil War= On December 14, 1861, during the American Civil War, Rhind was ordered to take command of the screw steamer ; and, while commanding her, earned the Thanks of the Navy Department in a letter dated September 7, 1864, for the capture and destruction of Confederate works commanding the South Edisto, Dawho, and Pon- Pon Rivers, in April 1862, and received promotion to lieutenant commander on July 16, 1862. Promoted to commander on January 2, 1863, in that year he participated in the attacks on Charleston's defenses as commanding officer of the ironclad ram . During the attack on April 7, 1863, Keokuk was struck over 90 times in 30 minutes, suffering 19 holes at or near her waterline. Retiring, she was kept afloat until the following morning, before finally sinking, by which time the crew had been taken off. Later, after commanding the gunboat and the screw frigate , on October 23, 1863, he assumed command of the side- wheel gunboat on the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, and earned praise from Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee for the \\"gallantry and endurance displayed\\" by himself and his crew during an engagement with three batteries at Deep Bottom on August 13, 1864. In December 1864 he was detailed to command the powder boat , which was loaded with 215 tons of gunpowder, then towed by to a point 250 yards off Fort Fisher. There Commander Rhind and his crew set the fuzes and started a fire before escaping to Wilderness. The blast from the explosion, although loud, did little damage and two days later Rhind returned to close proximity to the fort to plant a marker buoy as near to the fort as possible to allow the fleet to bombard Fort Fisher at close range. Admiral Porter, in his official report to the Navy Department, wrote; : \\"In conclusion, allow me to draw your attention to Commander Rhind and Lieutenant Preston. They engaged in the most perilous adventure that was, perhaps, ever undertaken. As an incentive to others I beg leave to recommend them for promotion. No one in the squadron considered that their lives would be saved, and Commander Rhind and Lieutenant Preston had made an arrangement to sacrifice themselves in case the vessel was boarded, a thing likely to happen.\\" In 1866 he became a Companion of the First Class of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) - a military society composed of the officers of Union armed forces and their descendants. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 208. =Post-war career= After the war, Rhind served as the commander of the receiving ship at New York City, then as commander of the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1869-70, finally receiving promotion to the rank of captain on March 2, 1870. He commanded the screw sloop from 1872-76 on the European Station, receiving promotion to commodore on September 30, 1876, then serving as a Lighthouse Inspector until 1879. He was President of the Board of Inspection and Survey from 1880–1882, and then Governor of the Naval Asylum in 1883. He was promoted to rear admiral on October 30, 1883, the day before his retirement, having reached the mandatory age. In 1890 he became a Veteran Member of the Aztec Club of 1847.

The church is a contributing property of the Middlebush Village Historic District that was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 24, 2007. The church is a part of the Reformed Church in America. History It was organized by Dutch settlers on March 19, 1834 in the Colonial Farms area of what is now Franklin Township, Somerset County, New Jersey. The initial three member committee included the first Reverend of the church Jacob Schultz. The settlers had \\"migrated from Manhattan Island seeking more tillable land\\".Words from Wes: Through Tradition into Mission at Middlebush Reformed Church Reformed Church Press, 23 March 2009. Residents were previously traveling to Reformed churches in Hillsborough, New Jersey; Franklin Park, New Jersey; or New Brunswick. The few Dutch families initially met in a barn \\"in what is now O'Connor's Beef 'N Chowder House on Amwell Road\\" owned by the Voorhees family. One descendant, Mary Amanda Voorhees, \\"Miss Amanda\\", later served as the church's organist for forty-five years. \\"[S]ervices continued there until 1835, when the white frame church was completed\\". Three locations for the church building were considered: one on Amwell Road north of the current location, one on South Middlebush Road south of the railroad tracks, and the current location on the corner of South Middlebush Road and Amwell Avenue. One acre of land was given for the church lot and about five more acres continuing along South Middlebush Road were purchased by the church. The acreage was divided into smaller lots and sold off in 1839. The cornerstone of the church building was laid on June 7, 1834. During construction, the search for a pastor began. Jacob I. Schultz (1792-1852), the pastor at Whitehouse Station, New Jersey and Lebanon, New Jersey was contacted. The new church building was dedicated on February 19, 1835. The final cost was $3,989. Schultz was formally installed as pastor on December 30, 1835. Lightning destroyed the church building on July 2, 1917, the New York Times noted part of the furniture was saved and the loss was estimated at $50,000. Congregation members who lived nearby rescued furniture and the church membership book. A kerosene lamp was saved, and is currently hanging in the church. Planning for the new building at the same site started immediately but construction was delayed by World War I. The Gothic revival building was rebuilt using stone from the Martinsville, New Jersey quarry. The church was rededicated in 1919. In 1972 the church set up a \\"mini\\" school. In 2003 the church started a living nativity which includes four readings from the Bible and ends with the adoration of the magi.\\"Church in Franklin to host annual living Nativity\\", Mary Ann Bourbeau, MyCentralJersey.com (combined website of Home News Tribune and Courier News), 4 December 2009.\\"Living Nativity being staged in Somerset\\", MyCentralJersey.com (combined website of Home News Tribune and Courier News), 5 December 2008.

She received her early education and musical training in Christiania, Norway. When she was 12 years of age her parents moved to America, settling in Minneapolis. Even before leaving Christiania, her progress on the piano had been such that she had appeared as an infant prodigy. She began her vocal training in New York City with Frederick Bristol in 1890 after singing in church choirs, then studied in Berlin with Lilli Lehmann before making her operatic debut as a mezzo-soprano as Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore at the Cologne Opera in 1895. She remained there for at least three years, before going on to Vienna, Munich, Bayreuth and London. Career She appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1903 until 1914, specializing in Wagnerian roles. By that time she was singing as a dramatic soprano. Fremstad appeared before the public 351 times as a member of the Met's stellar roster, most frequently as Venus in Tannhäuser, Kundry in Parsifal, Sieglinde, Isolde and Elsa in Lohengrin. American audiences never warmed much to her interpretation of the title role in Bizet's Carmen, but she had sung the role opposite Enrico Caruso in San Francisco the night before the city was wrecked by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and ensuing fire. (She and Caruso escaped the disaster unharmed.) Olive Fremstad as Carmen (Metropolitan Magazine 1905) Later in her career, Fremstad experienced difficulties with the top notes of the dramatic soprano range. She retired from professional singing in 1920 and briefly attempted teaching, but her patience for anything less than perfection in her pupils proved to be slim. One \\"lesson\\" involved the close examination of a dissected human head preserved in a jar. She was mystified when her few students fled in horror, unwilling to study the human larynx in such a setting. She used this head as a tool for determining whether or not prospective students had the \\"mettle\\" for an opera career. For Fremstad herself this wasn't anything special; when studying for the role of Salome in the Metropolitan's premier production, she had gone to the morgue in New York to find out just how much she should stagger under the weight of the head of John the Baptist. Her output of recordings is meager. She made approximately 40 recordings between 1911 and 1915, only 15 of which were ever released. Music critic J.B. Steane has called Fremstad \\"one of the greatest of Wagnerians\\";Steane (1974) p. 46 but in his The Record of Singing, Volume 1, the opera historian Michael Scott describes her as always being more of a mezzo-soprano than a genuine soprano. Scott, however, acknowledges her impressive qualities as an interpretive artist. Fremstad allegedly professed to have no interest in romantic entanglements. However, she wed twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. She and her secretary, Mary Watkins Cushing, also lived together for some time. She died in Irvington, New York, but was buried alongside her parents in a family plot in the village cemetery in Grantsburg, Wisconsin. Fremstad was the model for Thea Kronborg, the heroine of Willa Cather's novel The Song of the Lark. Her relationship with Cushing was fictionalized in the novel Of Lena Geyer, by Marcia Davenport.

The estimated cost of construction in 1973 was $450 million. By 1979, the amount had grown to $3.4 billion. On June 2, 1979, just two months after the partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania, a group of people climbed over the barbed wire fence that surrounded the Black Fox Power Plant. Protesters carried their backpacks, tents and acoustic guitars in an attempt to disrupt construction and camp out overnight. About 500 people were arrested for protesting. On February 16, 1982, Public Service Company of Oklahoma canceled the Black Fox project.

She first appears as the sub-boss and playable character in The King of Fighters 2000; she enters as a normal participant in her other appearances. Originally a member of the organization NESTS, Kula is the result of an experiment to kill the rebellious K', earning the title of . However, during NESTS' destruction, Kula forms a bond with K' and his allies to the point of joining his team. In following titles she lives with K' under the care of the cyborg Maxima. She is also present in a number of spin-off games in the franchise, most notably SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy as well as Akihiko Ureshino's novelizations of the games and comic books from China. Kula was created to add more characters to the NESTS syndicate and to add more depth to the series' second story arc. Designed carefully to appeal to female players, SNK was satisfied with her physical appearance. Yumi Kakazu has voiced Kula in all of her appearances, while Kat Cassteneda provides her English voice in the spin-off game KOF: Maximum Impact 2. At first the character got a mixed reception as comparisons were made between her and earlier SNK fighters. Subsequently, journalists and video game reviewers have been largely positive about Kula liking her fighting style, mostly for her use of ice, as well as her contrast with K'. However, the character's attractiveness also earned a mixed reaction. Critics were divided over her beauty and her skimpy designs in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. Creation and design Although Kula has been given different outfits in some games, for Kimi wa Hero she was redesigned as an adult. Art by Falcoon SNK created Kula Diamond to bring more complexity to the NESTS' story arc in the series. Her character added another dimension to the villainous NESTS organization in the NESTS Chronicles. She was to add excitement to the story as an enemy and a foil of K'. Newly hired female staff designed her to depict a \\"14-year-old girl\\" with \\"appropriately girlish\\" gestures. The unnamed character designer was pleased with Kula's design saying: \\"Kula had an easy delivery. She didn't give me any pain.\\" Despite being Ks foil, Kula's was designed to closely resemble her rival as both fighters wear similar leather outfits with contrasting colors. According to artist Hiroaki, Kula does not look like a 14 year old girl in the illustrations. Nevertheless, he claims he grew attached to drawing her alongside K'. Yumi Kakazu has voiced Kula in all of her appearances. In KOF: Maximum Impact 2, Falcoon gave her a color palette that makes her look like fighter Ash Crimson as well as the robot Candy. Her alternative costume is that of a coquettish ice skater. Falcoon also once envisioned an adult version of Kula for the game Kimi wa Hero. For The King of Fighters XIII, the staff decided to make Kula similar to her original incarnation in The King of Fighters 2000. The team had no problems in designing her gameplay and added taunts where the character becomes boring. Similar to K's moves, the developers wanted Kula's trademarks, most notably her ice moves, to be appealing to see. A move that exemplifies this was the \\"Crow Bites\\". Kula's \\"Diamond Breath\\" move was recommended for new players, while the \\"Reispin\\" was designed to make the gameplay more complex and challenging as Kula becomes stronger when executing it. Kula's strongest technique in the game involves the appearance of Foxy and Diana who attack the enemy alongside her. This technique went through numerous trials before it was added to the game. When developing The King of Fighters XIV with the Unreal Engine, the original game had more realistic visuals but they clashed with character designs of Kula and Athena Asamiya. The designs looked like those in an anime series so the designers opted for the current look. A programmer with the alias of \\"Ando\\" designed the blades on Kula's boots during special attacks. Kula was the first character in KOF XIV to be given this type of design, requiring multiple attempts to work with her 3D character model. Ando further believed Kula could wield other type of weapons based on the variety used by the cast but in the end felt using blades could prove to be more challenging. An extra outfit for Kula was released for The King of Fighters XIV as downloadable content. In SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy, Kula appears wearing Angel's skimpy clothing. Director Kaito Soranaka said during an interview that Kula was his favorite character in the game. Ogura said that having Kula wear Angel's outfit brought up the fact that Kula hates Angel, so the game's villain, Kukri, gave her that appearance to humiliate her. Appearances Kula Diamond is a teenage girl who was experimented on by NESTS in order to exterminate the cartel's traitor, K'. Despite the fact their subject was a mindless puppet with no sign of emotions, the NESTS cartel created an android called Candy Diamond to monitor Kula's behavior and to ensure that she would accomplish her missions. During KOF 2000, Kula can be fought as a mid-boss during her debut. Shortly afterwards, Kula destroys the main Zero Cannon from its titular creator who is betraying NESTS. Candy shields Kula's descent from space by sacrificing her body in the process, as it is badly burned by Earth's atmosphere. While recovering from the trauma of Candy's destruction, in the following game, The King of Fighters 2001, Kula enters into the fighting tournament with fellow NESTS' agents Foxy, K9999 and Angel to capture K'. During the story, Kula and Foxy are betrayed by K9999 and Angel. However, in K's Team ending among others, she is seen as being safe and forms a friendship with her original target and allies. In the story-less game, KOF 2002, Kula appears as member of a team with Angel and K9999. In KOF 2003, she appears in the ending of K' Team where the group go to recruit her following an apparent threat. She participates in KOF XI and KOF XIII with K' and Maxima as her allies, having also joined forces with the Ikari Team. They are assigned to investigate a group known as \\"Those From The Past\\". In KOF XIV, she once again participates in the tournament following the Ikari's orders to investigate NESTS' agents. During these games, the K' Team become allied with the Ikari Team to help them on missions though they tend to avoid them. Kula is also present in the spin- off games, Neowave which does not feature a story and KOF: Maximum Impact 2 where looks for a doctor to repair Maxima's cybernetic body. She also appears in The King of Fighters '98: Unlimited Match Online and The King of Fighters Online. She is also present KOF: Sky Stage, Neo Geo Heroes: Ultimate Shooting and SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy. In SNK Heroines the female fighters must fight their way home but are confronted by Kukri and defeat him before he can initiate his grand plan on the kidnapped female fighters. She also makes a cameo appearance alongside Maxima in the ending of K' from NeoGeo Battle Coliseum. She is playable in the mobile phone game Kimi wa Hero (as an adult) and Brave Frontier, while also making a cameo in the dating sim Days of Memories should the player interact with K'. She has since made guest appearances in more games, including the role-playing game Valkyrie Connect. She also appears as a downloadble character in Koei Tecmo's fighting game Dead or Alive 6. In her story chapter, NiCO pulls her into the Dead or Alive dimension while experimenting with subspace portals. Kula and NiCO briefly spar, and NiCO later thanks her for providing \\"interesting data\\" while swearing her to secrecy. The printed adaptations of The King of Fighters retell Kula's role in the NESTS' story arc where she constantly clashes with K', having a more antagonistic characterization until the events of 2001 and 2002. She also appears in the CD dramas from KOF 2000, in which she attacks K' before the events of her the story. However, this ends when K' is knocked out by Maxima for fighting with his wounded arm and the fugitive escapes with the unconscious K' from Kula. A cyborg named Rugal Bernstein kidnaps Kula during the 2002 storyline to absorb her powers. Using this, Rugal manages to defeat the fighters Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, but in the end he is stopped by K' and Maxima who rescue their former enemy. In the comic of The King of Fighters XII, Kula engages the mysterious Magaki alongside K' and former NESTS' agent Nameless. Reception Kula's character has been mostly well received. Den of Geek listed her as the 35th best character of the franchise, citing her appealing upbeat characterization while liking the idea of her not only being a foil for K', but how she \\"simply centers him by being his loving opposite\\". In an article on the history of SNK, GameSpot described Kula as the yin to the yang due of K' to how different both characters are in terms of the elements they control while fighting. Falcoon noted the character had become popular with fans of the series as after a poll on his Twitter account asking what character he should draw. GameSpot, however, criticized Kula and Hinako as the least interesting additions to the cast of The King of Fighters 2000. IGN found Kula to be one of the most appealing characters in The King of Fighters 2000 though the reviewer felt newcomer Lin might be superior. In another article, the same site liked the fact Kula was as a regular playable character unlike the original version, but felt she was still overshadowed by Lin. In a later review, IGN lamented the lack of Geese Howard but believed both Kula and K' could fill the gap. IGN felt Kula's inclusion in The King of Fighters 2002 alongside K', rather than other famous characters in the series, works with those that are included. Eurogamer and other publications enjoyed return of the originally \\"inexplicably\\" absent from The King of Fighters XII in following titles of \\"familiar faces\\" alongside Maxima and K'. 4thLetter enjoyed the contrast between K's characterization from that of his teammates, Maxima and Kula, noting that the team's ending from XIII had him enjoying his vacation by beating up unknown enemies. PlayStation Universe opined fans should look forward to Kula and K' in The King of Fighters XIV as their game styles would appeal to gamers. In a review for KOF: Maximum Impact 2, GameSpot felt Kula and Billy Kane were two of the best new characters. In a museum of videogames sponsored by the municipality of Rome, a special illustration lists Kula as the mascot of the new millennium era of Neo Geo. GameZone enjoyed her fighting mechanics in The King of Fighters XI, comparing her style to \\"athletes participating in the acclaimed Olympic event\\" enjoying SNK's execution of the character despite the reviewer's dislike of the concept. 3DJuegos felt that Kula's moves in The King of Fighters XI were overpowered; she was far more balanced in XIV. Siliconera found her fighting style in SNK Heroines: Tag Team Frenzy to be ridiculous due to the use of \\"cups of what appears to be sorbet\\". Other reviewers focused on the character's sex appeal. Cheat Code Central referred to Kula as one of the most sexually appealing female characters in gaming thanks to her design, abilities, and traits, comparing her looks to those of Hatsune Miku. Universo Nintendo also enjoyed the alternative outfits for Kula, especially her dancer costume. Shoryuken liked Kula's alternative outfits in SNK Heroines, noting how they give her distinct looks. However, the site noted the fact that Kula can wear skimpy dresses might divide players and make them uncomfortable due to her young age. Atomix was more critical of the release of SNK Heroines for having their female characters fight in skimpy dresses. A similar response was given when Kula appeared as a guest character in Dead or Alive 6 for her young age. Nevertheless, Destructoid found the character's moves appealing.

He was notable for creating the market for decorative lunch boxes. The company was further diversified under Johnson's leadership. He was a businessman in Nashville, Tennessee.  Aladdin Industries  Aladdin was founded by his father Victor S. Johnson Sr.. The younger Johnson graduated from Yale Law School in 1941. When his father died in 1943, the younger Johnson took over the company after his discharge as a second lieutenant from the United States Army in February 1946. = Lunch boxes = Johnson moved Aladdin's operation from Chicago, Illinois in 1949 to Nashville to save money on natural gas needed for glass making. In 1950, in an effort to increase vacuum flask sales, Aladdin attached Hopalong Cassidy decals to plain metal lunch boxes they had been selling since the 1940s. Sales jumped from 50,000 to 600,000 units the first year and transformed the lunch box industry. = Litigation over \\"thermos\\" = Because their lunch boxes included a vacuum flask for holding beverages, Aladdin became embroiled with King-Seeley over use of the term Thermos, which was a trademark. According to the Smithsonian Institution, \\"In a 1963 court ruling, it was established that Aladdin and its customers use the word thermos in all lowercase, never use the word in solid capitals letters and can only have an initial capital letter if the rules of grammar require it. Additionally, the word thermos must be preceded by a possessive of the name Aladdin and in advertising it must clearly identify material as Aladdin.\\"  Development of downtown Nashville  In 1956 Johnson was elected president of the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. Johnson worked on the consolidation of city and county governments in 1963. Aladdin, in 1958, was selected as the subject of a New Horizons network television documentary, with special emphasis on its clean, efficient manufacturing, a welcomed improvement over smokestack factories prevalent at that time. In 1963, Aladdin was honored with presentation of an E-Award as designated by the late President John F. Kennedy for excellence in export expansion. Johnson was one of the developers for MetroCenter during the redevelopment of downtown Nashville in the 1970s. Nashville banker William F. Earthman said in 1979, \\"Without Victor Johnson, we never would have had Metropolitan government. He had a vision and absolute determination to see it through when an awful lot of people didn't like the idea.\\"  Later life  Johnson remained active in philanthropic causes throughout his life. He was chairman of the board of trustees of Meharry Medical College in Nashville from 1956 to 1983 and was honored with a life membership on the board. He was also a member of the board of trustees of George Peabody College for Teachers from 1954 to 1964. The Judge William E. Miller Prize at Yale Law is a gift from Victor S. Johnson Jr. in memory of judge William E. Miller. He and his wife founded the Nancy and Victor S. Johnson Jr. Foundation. In 2005, Johnson figured by happenstance in the Seigenthaler incident, a controversy over a hoax posted as a Wikipedia article about prominent Nashville resident John Seigenthaler Sr. Seigenthaler told reporters that Johnson was the first person who alerted him about the article. Johnson died in Nashville of colon cancer, at the age of 91. He was survived by wife Nancy, son Victor S. Johnson III, daughter Christine Tyler, and five grandchildren.

HD 1237 differs from the sun in that HD 1237 is much younger, has high metallicity, has much cooler temperature and is in a binary system. As of 2000, it has been confirmed that an extrasolar planet orbits the star. It is of note for being a relatively Sun-like star not very far from the Sun that is home to an extrasolar planet. Stellar components As a nearby Sun-like star, the last decade has seen HD 1237 A being studied carefully for the first time, especially after its substellar companion was discovered. It is currently believed that it is 800 million years old, though age estimates range from 150 million to 8.8 billion years old depending on the method used for the determination. The star is more enriched with iron than the Sun, is chromospherically active, and rotates around its axis more quickly than the Sun. The secondary star was discovered in 2006 during a deep imaging survey conducted at the European Southern Observatory using the Very Large Telescope.

Planetary system Announced in 2000, the Jovian planet GJ 3021 b (GJ 3021 being an alternate less-used designation for this star) orbits about 0.5 astronomical units from HD 1237 A with a minimum mass 3.37 times that of Jupiter, as determined by measuring variations in the radial velocity of the star. A study published in 2001 suggested that the usual inability to determine the orbital inclination of an extrasolar planet through radial velocity measurement had caused this mass to be severely underestimated. The astrometric orbit gives an orbital inclination of 11.8° and a mass of 16 Jupiter masses, which would make the object a brown dwarf. However, later analysis showed that Hipparcos was not sensitive enough to accurately determine astrometric orbits for substellar companions, which means the inclination (and hence the true mass) of the planet are still unknown.

The airfield was named after the village of Parham in Suffolk famously linked to the Aldeburgh poet George Crabbe. Control tower at Parham Airfield Overview The museum comprises the 390th Bombardment Group Memorial Air Museum and the Museum of the British Resistance Organisation operating under one Management Committee. Its continued existence relies on volunteer support and donations to help with maintenance necessary to ensure continued preservation of the building and its contents. It is a wonderful day out for all ages. All of the volunteers are lively and full of information. 390th Bombardment Group Memorial Air Museum The 390th Bombardment Group Memorial Air Museum is housed in the original World War II control tower of Framlingham Station 153. Exhibits focus on the history of the U.S 8th Air Force, the Royal Air Force and the German Luftwaffe in the Second World War. Displays include recovered Second World War aircraft engines, parts of Allied and German aircraft, uniforms, photographs, documents, combat records, paintings and memorabilia. The museum opened in 1981.390th Bombardment Group Memorial Air Museum , UK. Museum of the British Resistance Organisation Opened in 1997, the Museum of the British Resistance Organisation is located in a Quonset hut adjacent to the control tower, and is dedicated to the Auxiliary Units, or as they were officially known ‘Auxunits’. In case the Germans succeeded in invading Britain, the men and women of the Auxiliary Units were trained to operate as the British underground resistance. They were to remain undetected in carefully constructed bunkers (Operating Bases \\\\- OBs) as the invading German Army made its way through Britain. The museum includes a replica underground Operational Base, as well as photographs, special weapons such as time pencil fuses and other explosives, dead letter boxes, agent instruction papers, and information about the special radio communications network installed by the Royal Corps of Signals. History of the museum After World War II in Europe, the Parham Airfield runways were broken up and the buildings were allowed to deteriorate and, when not pulled apart, were used for farm storage. Among them was the control tower, shot up and abandoned after the Americans held a riotous farewell party there in August 1945. Framlingham Station 153, as the 390th bomb group knew the airfield, now stood neglected, windowless and derelict. In 1976, it was then that a small band of determined enthusiasts decided to restore the decaying building as a museum in tribute to the endeavours of the 390th Bomb Group, 8th US Army Air Force and other Allied airmen operating from bases throughout East Anglia during the Second World War. A five-year restoration programme began, using volunteer labour and funded from their own resources and the Tower was finally dedicated as the 390th Bombardment Group Memorial Air Museum of the USAAF on 13 May 1981 and, since then, has remained in active contact with, and received support from US veterans, their relatives, supporters and Friends. Reconstruction of an Operational base at the museum. The Museum of the British Resistance Organisation was created in 1997, with the opening ceremony being carried out by Lieutenant Colonel J.W. Stuart Edmundsun, TD, RE, one of the founders of the nondescript ‘Most Secret’ GHQ. Auxiliary Units, as they were officially known. The ‘Auxunits’ were one of Britain’s nine secret services of World War II, alongside better known clandestine organisations such as the Security Service (MI5), the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), and the Special Operations Executive.

Penny played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Florida / Miami Marlins, Los Angeles Dodgers, Boston Red Sox, San Francisco Giants, St. Louis Cardinals, and Detroit Tigers, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. He was an All Star in 2006 and 2007. Early life and career Penny was born in Blackwell, Oklahoma. He graduated from Broken Arrow Senior High where he was an All-State selection and Frontier Conference Pitcher of the Year. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 5th round of the 1996 MLB draft, and signed with the Diamondbacks on June 4, 1996. He was immediately sent to the Arizona Summer League, where he ranked fourth in the league in ERA (2.36) and was named Arizona's Organizational Pitcher of the Month in August. With the South Bend Silver Hawks in 1997, he was 10–5 with an ERA of 2.73 in 25 starts. In 1998, with the High Desert Mavericks, he went 14–5 with a 2.96 ERA in 28 starts and was named to Baseball America's first team Minor League All-Stars, the California League Pitcher of the Year, California League Most Valuable Player, Arizona Diamondbacks Minor League Player of the Year and \\"A\\" Level Player of the Year. In 1999, he started the year with the El Paso Diablos at the Diamondbacks Double-A level, and had a 2–7 record with a 4.80 ERA when he was traded to the Florida Marlins along with Abraham Núñez and Vladimir Núñez in exchange for relief pitcher Matt Mantei. The Marlins assigned him to their Double-A team in Portland. Penny combined with Luis Arroyo for the first no-hitter in Portland history in his first game in the Marlins' organization on August 8. Major League career =Florida Marlins= After a good spring, he made the Marlins starting rotation in 2000. He made his first MLB appearance and first start on April 7, 2000, against the Colorado Rockies. Penny pitched seven innings, giving up only one run, to get his first MLB win in the Marlins' 4–3 victory. At the end of the season, he ranked second among NL rookies in winning percentage (.533), third in wins, tied for fourth with 22 games started and was sixth in both innings pitched () and strikeouts (80). In 2001, Penny pitched 205 innings for the Marlins. He finished 10-10 in 31 starts. In 2002, due to injuries and ineffectiveness, Penny saw his ERA rise from the previous season, from 3.69 in 2001, his ERA in 2002 was at 4.66 in just 24 starts. In 2003, Penny bounced back, finishing the 2003 campaign with 14 wins for the Marlins and helping them reach the playoffs. Penny collected the win in Florida's NLCS clinching victory over the Chicago Cubs and in the World Series against the New York Yankees he went 2–0 with a 2.19 ERA in his two starts. Penny started the 2004 season with an 8-8 record with a 3.15 ERA in 21 starts before being traded to the Dodgers. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Penny pitching for the Los Angeles Dodgers during spring training action in Arizona, 2008. On July 30, 2004, Penny was traded along with Hee-Seop Choi and pitching prospect Bill Murphy to the Los Angeles Dodgers in exchange for Guillermo Mota, Juan Encarnación, and Paul Lo Duca. However, in the first inning of his second start with the Dodgers he suffered a serious arm injury and went on the disabled list.http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040815&content;_id=828758&vkey;=news_la&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=la He returned in September, only to promptly reinjure himself after three innings in his first start off the DL. His recovery time from his injury caused him to begin the following season on the disabled list, but he rejoined the Dodgers on April 24, 2005, and proceeded to have a solid season. On June 12, 2005, Penny signed a three-year contract extension worth a guaranteed $25 million and a team option for the 2009 season. Penny was named by Houston Astros manager Phil Garner as the National League's starting pitcher in the 2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He hurled two innings, allowing one home run to Vladimir Guerrero, striking out the side (Ichiro Suzuki, Derek Jeter, and David Ortiz) in the first inning, and receiving a no-decision. On September 23, 2006, against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Penny joined the small club of pitchers who have struck out four batters in one inning. Due to the uncaught third strike rule, Penny was credited with striking out Chad Tracy, but because catcher Russell Martin failed to catch the ball cleanly, Tracy was allowed to attempt to run to first base, and made it there before he could be thrown out. Despite giving up three runs in the inning, Penny recorded three more strikeouts to complete the four-strikeout inning. He also threw the fastest fastball of all NL starters in 2006, averaging 93.9 miles per hour. Penny had a strong start to 2007 that continued throughout the season, with an ERA of 3.03 for the season and was the first Dodger pitcher to start out with a 12–1 record since Phil Regan went 14–1 in 1966. Penny was selected to the All-Star game for a second consecutive year. Penny had several memorable outings in 2007, including on May 7, 2007, against his former team, the Florida Marlins, Penny struck out a career-high 14 in a Dodger 6–1 win. Another memorable performance was against the San Diego Padres in a pitcher's duel against All-Star teammate Jake Peavy just before the All-Star break. The match ended in a draw with both pitchers going seven innings giving up one earned run on five hits. Penny struck out seven, while Peavy struck out six. The Padres would eventually win the game 3–1 in 12 innings. He also threw the fastest fastball of all NL starters in 2007, averaging 93.4 miles per hour. Besides being a hard throwing pitcher, Penny developed into a good hitting pitcher since being traded to the Dodgers. In 2006, his batting average was .185, but was above .200 for most of the season and was as high as .240 before Penny ended the year in an 0 for 12 slump. He batted .246 in 2007. Penny also had six doubles, seven RBI, and seven runs scored. For the 2008 season, Penny was selected as opening day starter against the San Francisco Giants, shutting them out over seven innings, but he struggled in 2008 overall, going 6–9 with a 6.27 ERA and a stint on the DL. After coming back from the DL in September, Penny made a few appearances out of the bullpen but struggled in that role and returned to the DL. After the season, the Dodgers declined his option year, making Penny a free agent. =Boston Red Sox= Penny during his tenure with the Boston Red Sox in 2009. On January 9, 2009, Penny signed a one-year deal with the Boston Red Sox with a base salary of $5M. Incentives and performance bonuses were included to increase the total deal another $3M.Red Sox Reach Deals With Free Agents Penny, Bard Penny recorded his 100th career win on June 17, 2009, against his former team the Florida Marlins, in a five inning effort only giving up one unearned run. The win came on the Red Sox's 500th consecutive sell out at Fenway Park. During his last five starts with the Red Sox, Penny was 0–4 with a 9.11 ERA. After a disastrous start against the rival Yankees, it was decided on August 22, 2009, that Penny would be replaced in the rotation by veteran knuckleballer Tim Wakefield who was coming off the disabled list soon. During Wakefield's August 26 start, Penny was placed in the bullpen as insurance, but was never needed with Wakefield pitching a strong seven inning effort giving up only one run. With Wakefield completing a healthy start, reliever Billy Wagner being added to the roster, and Penny not wanting to be a reliever, the Red Sox granted his wish to be released late that night. During his time in Boston, Penny's record was 7–8, with a 5.61 ERA. =San Francisco Giants= On August 31, 2009, Penny signed with the San Francisco Giants after clearing waivers. The Giants paid Penny only the pro- rated remnant of a $400k MLB minimum salary (i.e. under $100k), with the Boston Red Sox picking up the remainder of his $5M salary for the year. In his debut, Penny pitched eight shutout innings in a 4–0 win over Philadelphia. Penny demonstrated his past success in the National League, going 4-1 in 6 starts for the Giants. He became a free agent after the season. =St. Louis Cardinals= On December 10, 2009, Penny agreed to a one-year contract with the St. Louis Cardinals. On May 21, 2010, Penny hit his first career grand slam, to give his team an 8–4 lead during interleague play against the Angels. He was pulled the next inning with an injury and therefore did not earn the win. The injury was an aggravation of a pre-existing oblique muscle strain that landed him on the disabled list for the remainder of the season. =Detroit Tigers= Penny with the Tigers in 2011 On January 18, 2011, Penny agreed to a one-year $3 million contract with the Detroit Tigers.Tigers finalize Penny deal, designate Galarraga MLB.com January 18, 2011 Being added to the Tigers roster reunited Penny with past teammates in Miguel Cabrera from the Marlins and Victor Martinez from the Red Sox. Penny started off the season with the Tigers as their number two starter, behind Justin Verlander and in front of Max Scherzer. In exception to May, in which Penny went 3–1 in five starts with an ERA of 3.24, Penny had a sub-par first half of the season, going 6–6 with a 4.50 ERA, and with the Tigers' acquisition of Doug Fister in July, in addition to the success of Scherzer, Penny was moved to the number four spot in the rotation. Penny had a worse second half, going 5–5 with a 6.53 ERA after the All-Star break. When the Tigers went to the Postseason, he was added to the roster in the bullpen. He appeared in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series against the Texas Rangers, his only appearance in both the Division and Championship series, and pitched 1.2 innings while giving up 5 runs. The Tigers went on to lose that game 15–5, which sent the Rangers to the World Series. The Rangers lost in 7 games to Penny's former club, the St. Louis Cardinals. = Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks = On February 5, 2012, Penny agreed to a one-year $3 million contract with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks.Brad Penny signs with Softbank Hawks ESPN, February 5, 2012 However, after allowing six runs and five stolen bases in only innings in his NPB debut game, Penny claimed that he injured his elbow and asked to be removed from the game.

Penny was released from his contract a month later, on May 8. He was a \\"huge disappointment,\\" and a local newspaper reported that signing Penny was \\"the worst decision in franchise history.\\" = Second stint with the San Francisco Giants = On May 18, 2012, Penny signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants. On June 30, Penny faced the Cincinnati Reds in his first game of the season. He went 2.1 innings, giving up 0 hits and 0 earned runs while striking out 1 batter.

It was devised by the sociologist James Cooke Brown. Victory conditions (a secret \\"Success Formula\\") consist of a minimum amount of fame, happiness and money that the player must gain. Players (from two to six) set their own victory conditions before the game begins, the total of which must be sixty (or one hundred, recommended when only two are playing).  Gameplay  The square- shaped board consists of an outer track and several minor loops (called occupation paths), each of which starts and ends at a space on the outer track. Originally there were eight loops, but that was later simplified to six. Some fame, happiness and money (\\"victory points\\") can be obtained on the outer track. These victory points can be obtained more quickly on the occupation paths. Each occupation path has more opportunities for certain types of victory points than others (e.g., in Hollywood there are many opportunities to get fame points). Each occupation also has certain minimum entry requirements. In the oldest versions of the game, players landing on a square occupied by another player are \\"knocked to the park bench\\" in one corner of the board, where they must throw a 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, or 12 to move on. Another corner has a square for a \\"Bermuda holiday\\" where players throwing below 7 can stay and accumulate happiness points. Another corner has a square for hospital fees, which must be paid to the bank or to another player who has obtained a medical degree by going to the 'university' occupation path. Occupation paths offer opportunities to collect extra points and to increase the annual salary, which is collected when passing the start square, or doubled if a player lands on it. However, there are a number of squares in the occupation paths with negative consequences, such as being sent to the park bench, having a salary cut or paying hospital fees. Completion of an occupation path enables a player to pick up an 'experience' card, which they can use instead of rolling the dice. These enable the player to move on one, two or three squares. If a player completes a single occupation path several times, they can pick up multiple experience cards. Other 'opportunity' cards are collected when landing on particular squares on the outer track which gives a player the option to move to an occupation path. Some of these cards are special or golden opportunities and enable the player to begin the occupation path without the usual prerequisites (usually a payment, a particular degree or having completed another occupation path). An unusual feature of this game compared to more modern board games is that individual players need to record much information on their own scoresheet, such as annual salary, degrees earned and number of times occupation paths have been completed. Towards the end of the game, players can trade cards for money or other favours (such as not knocking to the park bench).

Russell (2008). Two Cheers for Minority Government: The Evolution of Canadian Parliamentary Democracy. p. 167. The term is rooted in an assertion that the interviewer may be supporting a hidden agenda, and aims to make film or sound recordings of the interviewee which may be selectively edited, compiled, and broadcast or published in order to intentionally show the subject in an unfavorable light.\\"Be A Freelance Writer\\". Surayud Chulanont. Global Media. , The term derives from the word gotcha, a contracted form of \\"got you\\", and emerged in political journalism during the 1980s and 1990s.  Techniques  \\"Gotcha\\" journalism can be used to get a subject with something genuinely discreditable to hide to reveal wrongdoing; there can be a fine line between robust and gotcha journalism. Some methods claimed to be gotcha journalism by those involved include moving away from the agreed upon topic of the interview and switching to an embarrassing subject that was agreed to be out-of-bounds and leading the interviewee to discuss it and commit to a certain answer, then, confronting them with prepared material designed to contradict or discredit that position. Gotcha journalism is often designed to keep the interviewee on the defensive by, for example, being required to explain some of their own statements taken out of context thus effectively preventing the interviewee from clearly presenting their position. The intent of gotcha journalism is always premeditated and used to defame or discredit the interviewees by portraying them as self-contradictory, malevolent, unqualified or immoral.With Malice Toward All? Patricia Moy, Michael Pfau. p. 43. It has also been used as an excuse to evade a question to which the interviewee does not know the answer, where their lack of knowledge would make them appear foolish or uninformed, or a subject where their intellectual position contradicts their past statements.  History  The notion of Gotcha journalism was highlighted during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic where daily press briefings were held in numerous countries by heads of government with journalists frequently asking similar, repetitive questions designed to 'catch out' politicians as opposed to asking questions pertinent to the concerns of members of the public during the pandemic. It was hypothesised that the public were frustrated with 'repetitive' gotcha political questions at the press conferences, and a poll during the pandemic by YouGov found that in the United Kingdom the public trusted politicians more than television and newspaper journalists. In the United Kingdom, members of the public were invited to ask questions to government ministers from 27 April onwards.

This means that the chief rays (oblique rays that pass through the center of the aperture stop) are parallel to the optical axis in front of or behind the system, respectively. The simplest way to make a lens telecentric is to put the aperture stop at one of the lens's focal points. An entrance pupil at infinity makes the lens object-space telecentric. Such lenses are used in machine vision systems because image magnification is independent of the object's distance or position in the field of view. An exit pupil at infinity makes the lens image-space telecentric. Such lenses are used with image sensors that do not tolerate a wide range of angles of incidence. For example, a three-CCD color beamsplitter prism assembly works best with a telecentric lens, and many digital image sensors have a minimum of color crosstalk and shading problems when used with telecentric lenses. If both pupils are at infinity, the lens is double telecentric (or bi-telecentric). Object-space telecentric lenses An idealized object-space telecentric lens, with one thin positive-powered element, has its aperture one focal length behind that element Non-telecentric lenses exhibit varying magnification for objects at different distances from the lens. Most lenses are entocentric—objects further away have lower magnification. For pericentric lenses, objects further away have higher magnification. The variation of magnification with distance causes several problems for machine vision and other applications: * The apparent size of objects changes with distance from the camera. * Some features or objects may be hidden by objects that are closer to the lens. * The apparent shape of objects varies with distance from the center of the field of view (FOV). Objects appearing close to the edges are viewed from an angle, while objects near the centre of the FOV are viewed frontally (circles near the centre of the FOV become egg-shaped when moved towards the periphery). Telecentric lenses, on the other hand, provide an orthographic projection, providing the same magnification at all distances. An object that is too close or too far from the lens may still be out of focus, but the resulting blurry image will have the same size as the correctly focused image would. Because their images have constant magnification and geometry, telecentric lenses are used for metrology applications, when a machine vision system must determine the precise size of objects independently from their position within the FOV and even when their distance is affected by some degree of unknown variations. These lenses are also commonly used in optical lithography for forming patterns in semiconductor chips. Object-space telecentric lenses have an entrance pupil infinitely far behind the lens; that is, if one looks in the front of the lens, the image of the aperture is very far away. Telecentric lenses tend to be larger, heavier, and more expensive than normal lenses of similar focal length and f-number. This is partly due to the extra components needed to achieve telecentricity, and partly because the object or image lens elements of an object or image-space telecentric lens must be at least as large as the largest object to be photographed or image to be formed. , these lenses can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of US dollars or euros, depending on quality. Because of their intended applications, telecentric lenses often have higher resolution and transmit more light than normal photographic lenses. In order to optimize the telecentric effect, these lenses are often used in conjunction with telecentric (or \\"collimated\\") illuminators, which produce a parallel light flow, often from LED sources. Image-space telecentric lenses An image-space (or image-side) telecentric lens produces images of the same size regardless of the distance between the lens and the film or image sensor. This allows the lens to be focused to different distances without changing the size of the image. Image-space telecentric lenses have an exit pupil infinitely far in front of the lens; that is, if one looks in the back of the lens, the image of the aperture is very far away. At the film or image sensor, all of the chief rays from these lenses hit \\"straight on\\", or at zero angle of incidence. This property minimizes any angle-of-incidence dependence of the sensor, or of any beam-splitter prism assembly behind the lens, such as a color separation prism in a three-CCD camera. Many lenses that have been specially optimized for digital SLR cameras are nearly telecentric on the image side, to avoid the vignetting and color crosstalk that occur in color filter array-based digital image sensors with oblique incident rays. The Four Thirds System uses this approach. Since the ray cones approaching the detector surface have the same angle of incidence and angular subtense everywhere in the image plane, the image is evenly illuminated. This feature is commonly used in photography and is very useful for radiometric and color measurement applications, where one would need the irradiance to be the same regardless of the field position. Lenses that are double-telecentric have magnification that is more precisely constant than those that are only object-side telecentric, because the principal ray intercept position on the detector does not change. This property allows precise measurement of objects regardless of position.

Her body is said to have been thrown into the Guadalquivir, but was rescued by the Christians. Her relics were kept and venerated in Old Castile at two churches, the priory of St. Columba and the royal Abbey of Our Lady at Nájera.Capes, Florence. \\"St. Columba (of Spain).\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

These were Columba of Sens and Columba of Spain. A Galician legend held that before becoming a virtuous virgin martyr, Comba was a witch. This legend relates that one day, the witch Comba, encountering Jesus Christ on a Galician road, changed her life after Christ remarked, “Go ahead and be the witch, but you will not enter my kingdom.”Allyson M. Poska, Women and Authority in Early Modern Spain: The Peasants of Galicia (Oxford University Press, 2005), 224. The tale states that Comba converted to Christianity and was martyred for her faith after refusing to deny it, or after refusing the sexual advances of men. She became the patron saint of witches in Galicia, acting both as an intercessor on behalf of witches and as an intercessor against witches.Allyson M. Poska, Women and Authority in Early Modern Spain: The Peasants of Galicia (Oxford University Press, 2005), 224-25.

He became a popular hero and martyr figure for Spain's subsequent War of Independence from the French Empire. A statue of Pedro Velarde y Santillán in Santander, Cantabria. Born to a Cantabrian family in Muriedas, Camargo, Velarde enrolled in the Artillery College (Colegio de Artillería) at the Alcázar de Segovia in 1793. He graduated near the top of his class and was promoted to Sub-Lieutenant in 1799. He fought in the War of the Oranges against Portugal in 1800 and was promoted to Lieutenant in 1801. Velarde returned to the Artillery College after the war and worked as an instructor of mathematics and ballistics, in which he became something of an expert. In 1806 he was made a secretary of the Artillery Corps' Junta Superior Económica and established himself in Madrid. Plaza del Dos de Mayo, Madrid When the mass uprisings broke out against the French occupiers on May 2, 1808, Velarde took up arms and rallied his men. Acting on orders from the local junta, Velarde led 37 soldiers to defend the Monteleón artillery barracks against the French. Velarde, along with his comrade Luís Daoíz de Torres and most of his soldiers, fell in the day's heavy fighting in which hundreds died. He was 28 years old. The name of one of the two lions standing at the Congreso de los Diputados is Velarde. The other lion's name is Daoiz. His body was recovered from the battlefield and carried off to a burial. Velarde's epic last stand, immortalized in artwork and monuments, assured him a central place in the pantheon of heroes from the national resistance to Napoleon that has since formed part of Spain's national mythology.

Early years Winston was born at Windsor, North Carolina, to Patrick Henry Winston and Martha Elizabeth Byrd, and the brother of Francis D. Winston. Winston entered the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill at the age of thirteen, where he was a member of the Chi Phi Fraternity and the Philanthropic Society. He then studied at the United States Naval Academy from 1868 to 1870, standing at the head of his class of seventy. He could not overcome violent nausea at sea and resigned. In 1870 he went to Cornell University, where he received a bachelor's in literature in 1874 and won membership in Phi Beta Kappa. Later honorary degrees included an A.M. from Davidson College in 1877 and LL.D. degrees from both Duke University and the University of North Carolina in 1911. Career =University of North Carolina = When the University of North Carolina was reopened after the Civil War, Winston, although only twenty-three years old, was elected adjunct professor of Latin and German. Promoted to professor the next year, he taught Latin and German and served as secretary of the faculty until 1891, when he was elected president of the university at the age of thirty-nine. He went to work with great energy and ability to make the state conscious of the university. He had a difficult task for North Carolina was still miserably poor from the effects of the war, but in five years the university's income was doubled, and its enrollment was almost tripled. =University of Texas = Winston was invited to deliver the commencement address at the University of Texas at Austin in June 1896. Discussing the influence of universities and public schools on national life and character, he spoke so effectively that the board of regents shortly elected him the university's first regular president. Leslie Waggener had been president ad interim. Winston entered on his work in Texas with the same vigor that he had shown in North Carolina. He made speeches, wrote articles, attended conventions, and labored with all classes of people to make them look upon the university as their own. The curriculum was revised, able instructors were brought to the faculty, the University Record was inaugurated, B. Hall and the Main Building were enlarged, but Winston was unhappy over slowness in improvements and accepted the presidency of the North Carolina State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts in 1899. =North Carolina State University= During his tenure as president of the North Carolina College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, now North Carolina State University, the college developed a new textiles curriculum and began offering summer courses. Winston's poor health led him to accept a Carnegie Pension and retire in 1908. He died in Durham, North Carolina, on August 26, 1932. Winston received many honors, among them the presidency of the Association of Southern Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1895. His publications included numerous reports, addresses, and articles, and one book, Daniel Augustus Tompkins, a Builder of the New South (1920). Winston Hall on the campus of North Carolina State University is named in his honor. Built in 1910 and renovated in 1988, Winston Hall currently houses the College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Personal life He was married on June 5, 1876, to Caroline S. Taylor of Hinsdale, New Hampshire; they became parents of four children.

It refers to a hand gesture or thumb signal used by Ancient Roman crowds to pass judgment on a defeated gladiator. The precise gesture described by the phrase pollice verso, and its meaning, are the subject of much scholarly debate. Ancient Rome The exact gesture described by the phrase ' is unclear. From historical, archaeological, and literary records it is uncertain whether the thumb was turned up, turned down, held horizontally, or concealed inside the hand to indicate positive or negative opinions.James Grout: The Gladiator and the Thumb, part of the Encyclopædia RomanaDesmond Morris, Peter Collett, Peter Marsh, and Marie O'Shaughnessy, 1979 Webified by Bernd Wechner: Gestures: Their Origin and Meanings, The Thumb Up Juvenal uses verso pollice in the Satires: {  ...Juvenal, Satirae 3.34-37 style=\\"padding-left:2em;\\"These men once were horn-blowers, who went the round of every provincial show, and whose puffed-out cheeks were known in every village; to-day they hold shows of their own, and win applause by slaying whomsoever the crowd with a turn of the thumb bids them slay.Juvenal Satires, translated by George Gilbert Ramsay (1839–1921) } Prudentius mentions the thumb gesture (converso pollice), used by a Vestal virgin who delights in the carnage: > inde ad consessum caveae pudor almus et expers sanguinis it pietas hominum > visura cruentos congressus mortesque et vulnera vendita pastu spectatura > sacris oculis. sedet illa verendis vittarum insignis phaleris fruiturque > lanistis. o tenerum mitemque animum! consurgit ad ictus et, quotiens victor > ferrum iugulo inserit, illa delicias ait esse suas, pectusque iacentis virgo > modesta iubet converso pollice rumpi, ne lateat pars ulla animae vitalibus > imis altius inpresso dum palpitat ense secutor. > Then on to the gathering in the amphitheatre passes this figure of life- > giving purity and bloodless piety [the Vestal], to see bloody battles and > deaths of human beings and look on with holy eyes at wounds men suffer for > the price of their keep.

Reply to > Symmachus, Book II, in Prudentius Volume II, translated by H. J. Thomson, > Loeb Classical Library 398, pp. 93-95. Popular culture The notion of the ' thumb signal was brought to modern popular attention by an 1872 painting by French history painter Jean-Léon Gérôme entitled Pollice Verso (usually translated into English as Thumbs Down). It is a large canvas that depicts the Vestal Virgins signifying to a murmillo that they decree death on a fallen gladiator in the arena. The picture was purchased from Gérôme by U.S. department-store magnate Alexander Turney Stewart, who exhibited it in New York City, and it is now in the Phoenix Art Museum in Arizona. Title page with illustration from \\"Pollice Verso\\": To the Lovers of Truth in Classic Art, This is Most Respectfully Addressed, 1879 The painting almost immediately kicked off a controversy over the accuracy of Gerome's use of the thumbs-down gesture by spectators in the Colosseum. A 26-page pamphlet published in 1879, \\"Pollice Verso\\": To the Lovers of Truth in Classic Art, This is Most Respectfully Addressed, reprinted evidence for and against the accuracy of the painting, including a letter dated 8 December, 1878 from Gérôme himself.\\"Pollice Verso\\": To the Lovers of Truth in Classic Art, This is Most Respectfully Addressed, pamphlet dated April 10, 1879, Paris. Gérôme's painting greatly popularized the idea that thumbs up signaled life, and thumbs down signaled death, for a defeated gladiator. The gesture is used in many movies about Ancient Rome, including the 2000 film Gladiator, in which the Roman emperor Commodus uses a thumbs-up to spare the life of the film's eponymous hero, Maximus. ' is also the title of a controversial 1904 drawing of the Crucifixion by Australian artist Norman Lindsay., depicting Christ being rejected by nude pagans.

Kneass is credited with designing the \\"Classic Head\\" motif, which appeared on numerous denominations of American currency, including the gold quarter eagle ($2.50) and half eagle ($5.00) gold pieces from 1834 to 1839. He also modified John Reich's \\"Capped Bust\\" design for use on the half dime through half-dollar from 1829 to 1837. Early life and career William Kneass was born September 25, 1780 in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He served in the War of 1812 as a volunteer associate of the field engineers, and helped construct fortifications on the western front of Philadelphia. He ran an engraving office on Fourth above Chestnut Street, Philadelphia, which was a popular meeting place for \\"leading wits and men of culture\\". Kneass also worked as an engraver of plates for bookwork. Although he mainly worked in line engraving, he was also known for producing aquatints. He also worked in two other engraving firms that bore his name: Kneass & Dellaker, and Young & Kneass & Co. Chief engraver of the U.S. Mint On January 29, 1824, Kneass was appointed Chief Engraver of the United States Mint. During his tenure as Chief Engraver, he oversaw production of gold coinage, and circulating coinage. In 1830, Kneass redesigned the quarter, and in 1834, redesigned the gold coinage. He also introduced a new Liberty head on the half dollar, a design that was modified several times over the next two years. In 1835 Mint director Samuel Moore wrote of him: \\"Mr. Kneass, our present engraver ... is an acceptable, popular and very useful Officer, perhaps one of the most rapid in execution in the U. States. I do not know whether another could be found, whose celerity in his profession could have sufficed to furnish all the dies we have necessarily employed within the last five years.\\"Taxay, p. 170 On August 27, 1835, Kneass suffered a debilitating stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side. Once second engraver Christian Gobrecht was hired, he did most pattern and die work until Kneass died in office on August 27, 1840. Kneass was succeeded by Gobrecht as Chief Engraver on December 21 of that year. Personal life and legacy Kneass was married to Mary Turner Honeyman Kneass. One of their 6 children, Samuel Honeyman Kneass (1806-1858), was a notable civil engineer and architect, based in Philadelphia. Another, Strickland Kneass (1821–1884), was an engineer. Kneass was remembered as \\"a warm gentleman of the old-school, who had the rare quality of engaging and winning the esteem and affection of children and youth\\" References Bibliography *  External links  * Category:1780 births Category:1840 deaths Category:United States Mint engravers Category:Artists from Lancaster, Pennsylvania ","title":"William Kneass"},{"id":"3397879","text":"The Bra Boys are a gang centred on surf culture, founded and based in Maroubra, an eastern suburb of Sydney, New South Wales in the 1990s. The gang has gained notoriety through violence and alleged links to organised crime, as well as some community activism. The Bra Boys achieved national and international media attention in 2007 with the release of a feature-length documentary entitled Bra Boys: Blood Is Thicker than Water, written and directed by members of the group, and narrated by Academy Award-winning actor Russell Crowe. Origins The Bra Boys are held together by surfing as well as community ties to the Maroubra area. The group is often linked with the Maroubra Surfers Association, with which a number of its members are associated. In an interview on Triple J radio, Koby Abberton pointed out that \\"Bra\\" is a reference to the gang's suburb, Maroubra, and partly after the street slang for brother. Some members of the gang tattoo \\"My Brother's Keeper\\" across the front of their chest, \\"Bra Boys\\" and Maroubra's postcode \\"2035\\" on their backs. With a reputation of being territorial, the group is known to have taken control of a Sydney reef break, known as 'Cape Solander', located in Kurnell, and renaming the break 'Ours'. In July 2007, The Sydney Morning Herald reported an altercation that took place between professional bodyboarder Mitch Rawlins and a group of several Bra Boys members, including Koby Abberton. Rawlins was allegedly approached by a Bra Boy member and told to \\"fuck off\\". It is believed an argument broke out and then turned physical with Rawlins being punched in the head. A spokesman for the Bra Boys confirmed there had been \\"some sort of small incident\\" but denied any major violence. Notoriety and violence Prominent Bra Boys members include rugby league players Reni Maitua, John Sutton, as well as the Abberton brothers, Sunny, Jai, Dakota, and Koby, with the last being the most notorious of the brothers. =Criminal matters= In late 2002, around 160 members of the gang attending a birthday party at the Coogee-Randwick RSL Club were involved in a brawl with off-duty Waverley police officers leaving a Christmas party on the same premises. News reports numbered the combatants in the incident at around 120, with 30 police officers left injured after the event. In 2005, Jai Abberton was acquitted of the 2003 murder of stand-over man Anthony 'Tony' Hines. However, his brother Koby was handed a suspended nine-month jail sentence after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice with regards to the same matter. In November 2008, Koby Abberton was jailed for three days by a US court after being found guilty of assaulting an off-duty police officer in a fight outside a nightclub in Honolulu, Hawaii. In November 2009 Jai Abberton was jailed for eight months for breaching a good behaviour bond. In 2009 a syndicate with alleged links to members of the Bra Boys were caught smuggling cocaine following interceptions of conversations dating back to 1997. It was alleged that syndicate members were granted security passes to restricted areas within Sydney Airport, bypassing Australian Customs, that enabled them to smuggle prohibited narcotics from Los Angeles concealed in on- board catering refuse. =2005 Cronulla race riots= In the lead up to the 2005 Cronulla riots in Cronulla, Koby Abberton spoke to The Daily Telegraph about the assault of a lifeguard that sparked the incident, claiming: > \\"The reason why it's not happening at Maroubra is because of the Bra Boys. > Girls go to Cronulla, Bondi, everywhere else in Sydney and get harassed, but > they come to Maroubra and nothing happens to them. I read all this stuff > about kids getting harassed because they want to have a surf and I say 'are > you kidding?' The beach should be for Aussie kids. But if you want to go to > beaches and act tough in groups you better be able to back it up. If these > fellas come out to Maroubra and start something they know it's going to be > on, so they stay away.\\" Members of the Bra Boys joined in the racial violence when the riots spread to Maroubra soon afterwards. Afterwards the Abberton brothers then held a joint media conference with members the Comanchero Motorcycle Club (a bikie gang, who include many Lebanese as their members) to help ease tensions, declaring peace. \\"I think that this is the start, the boys have agreed to come down and talk to us, to start some dialogue between the groups, you know, to try and ease some tension\\", said Sunny Abberton in a group interview on The 7.30 Report. =General community activism= In August 2005, the Bra Boys led a 100-person non-violent protest against plans by Randwick Council to introduce parking meters near the local beaches. MBK Clothing Inspired by the friendship and brotherhood codes instilled by the Bra Boys, the Abberton brothers created a clothing line entitled MyBrothersKeeper Clothing.  Documentary  A 90-minute documentary film about the surf gang entitled Bra Boys: Blood is Thicker than Water premiered in Sydney on 7 March 2007 and was released on 15 March 2007. The film details a story of the Bra Boys from the viewpoint of the gang, particularly the Abbertons. Sunny Abberton wrote and co-directed the film with Macario De Souza. Actor Russell Crowe provided narration. The film's official cast included 49 well-known surfers from Bra Boys members Evan Faulks and Richie 'Vas' Vaculik to eleven-time world champion Kelly Slater and surfing legends including Mark Occhilupo, Bruce Irons, and Laird Hamilton. Australian reviewer Margaret Pomeranz gave the movie an overall positive review, while her At the Movies co-host David Stratton criticised Sunny's amateurish direction and questioned how objective a documentary can be when it is directed by its subject. The documentary became Australia's highest-grossing non-IMAX documentary film and won the Best Documentary at the 2008 Movie EXTRA Filmink Awards. The movie saw a limited release in the United States that began on 11 April 2008 in 23 select locations in Southern California, New York and Hawaii. The film was distributed in Australia by Hopscotch Films and internationally by boutique distributor Berkela Films. The film was released on DVD on 16 August 2007 with extras including the documentary The Making of Bra Boys, extended surfing footage, coverage of the film's premiere, history of Australian surf culture, a fitness program presented by one of the Bra Boys, and music videos. In popular culture The Bra Boys were made the subject of satire by The Chaser's War on Everything, episode 29, aired on 11 April 2007. In the skit Julian Morrow approached gang members while wearing a pill-filled brassiere and sporting a tattoo similar to Koby Abberton's saying \\"mybrothersalibi\\". A gang member responded by slipping off one of his thong sandals and flinging it at Morrow. Long-running Australian television soap opera Home and Away has produced a thinly veiled reference to the Bra Boys in the fictional storyline of \\"the River Boys\\" that was broadcast in Australia commencing 16 February 2011. The 2011 Chris Lilley mockumentary Angry Boys featured fictional surf gangs the Mucca Mad Boys and the Fennel Hell Men, which have been described as similar to the Bra Boys.http://www.couriermail.com.au/ipad/lilley-keeps-his- feet-on-the-ground/story-fn6ck8la-1226032456574 References Further reading * External links *Maroubra Surfers Association Category:Australian fringe and underground culture Category:Surfing in Australia Category:Gangs in Australia ","title":"Bra Boys"},{"id":"3397921","text":"Lady's Secret (April 8, 1982 - March 4, 2003) was an American Eclipse Award winning Thoroughbred racemare that was listed in the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. Lady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in Oklahoma. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein (former owner of the San Diego Chargers), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds. Breeding and background Lady's Secret was sired by U.S. Triple Crown champion Secretariat and out of Great Lady M., a daughter of Icecapade who was a half brother to Ruffian. Lady's Secret was also closely related to Ruffian on her sire's side since Secretariat and Reviewer (Ruffian's sire) shared a sire in Bold Ruler. Lady's Secret was bred by Robert H. Spreen at Lucas Farm in Oklahoma. Spreen sold her for $200,000 to Mr. and Mrs. Eugene Klein (former owner of the San Diego Chargers), and she was prepared for racing by Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. She was a small horse, weighing no more than about 900 pounds. Racing record Lady's Secret, who was a front runner, won twenty-five of her forty-five races and had nine second-place finishes. The daughter of Secretariat dominated the fillies she raced against and was also competitive against males. After winning the Moccasin Stakes at age two, Lady's Secret won three important races at age three, including two Grade I events, and ran second to stablemate Life's Magic in the 1985 Breeders' Cup Distaff. In 1986, four-year-old Lady's Secret defeated the nation's best male horses four times, winning ten of her fifteen starts that season, all graded stakes races. Eight of these stakes wins were Grade 1 events, a single-season Grade 1 winning record only equaled by the champion Cigar during his undefeated 1995 campaign. Nicknamed \\"The Iron Lady,\\" Lady's Secret was the first female to win the Whitney Stakes since Gallorette in 1948. She finished her year by winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff with Pat Day aboard. Her lifetime earnings equaled $3,021,325. Her performance throughout the 1986 racing season earned her the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse plus the most prestigious honor of all, and a rarity for fillies, the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year for 1986. Lady's Secret is ranked at number 76 by Blood-Horse magazine in their list of the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century. Stud record Retired at age five, in 1989 Lady's Secret was sold to Fares Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, as a broodmare. She and Azeri (horse) are the only two female winners of the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year to have produced foals by more than one stallion who was also Horse of the Year (Lady's Secret produced foals by Seattle Slew and Skip Away). Lady's Secret died suddenly on March 4, 2003 at Valley Creek Farm in Valley Center, California, as a result of complications in foaling. She produced 12 foals, with 10 starters and 5 winners. None of her progeny were of particular note. In 1992, Lady's Secret was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The Lady's Secret Café at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey is named in her honor. In 1993, a major race at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California, was named in her honor, but from 2012 it was known as the Zenyatta Stakes, after the 2010 American Horse of the Year who won that race in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Lady's Secret Drive in Del Rayo Estates, Rancho Santa Fe, California, where her owner lived, was also named in her memory. Valley Creek Farm has since been sold. The new owner is in the process of developing The Lady's Secret Memorial Garden as a tribute to the great race mare.

The population in 2011 was 13,193,Instituto Nacional de Estatística in an area of 91.29 km². It includes four civil parishes () that provide local services. History Painting of the Battle of Roliça, showing French troops in the hilltops attacking the much larger British force in the valley It is known that the area of Bombarral was occupied during the geological period, and there exist vestiges of human settlement throughout the municipality, including pre-historic remnants in Gruta Nova, Lapa do Suão and the Neolithic fortifications of Columbeira and the Castro de São Mamede. Most documented references to Bombarral begin in the 14th century, when the area was under the dominion of the Monastery of Alcobaça. With the creation of Portugal, King Afonso Henriques donated the lands to Cistercian monks, around 1153. Before, the Battle of Aljubarrota King John of Portugal stayed in Bombarral with his Knight, Luís Henriques, in the strong-house that would later be converted into the municipality's council hall. In the 18th century it was recognized as \\"Queens lands\\", and part of the municipality of Cadaval until 1852. During the Peninsular War, 15000 Anglo-Portuguese troops confronted a much smaller army of French infantry and cavalry (5000 total) in Roliça in the first engagement by British forces. The Battle of Roliça, along the northern frontier with Óbidos, was a confrontation between English General Arthur Wellesley and French General Henri François, Comte Delaborde, who were sent by General Jean- Andoche Junot, to harass and hold British forces until a much larger force could confront the English. The valleys and gullies of Roliça allowed the small French contingent to confront the much larger British force, yet they were unable to defeat them. Although successful, Wellesley did not press the fleeing French troops (who withdrew to Montachique near Torres Vedras), and instead went to support the landing of 4000 troops arriving from England along the coast. The railway connecting Bombarral to Lisbon and Leiria came in 1887, starting a period of accelerated economic development. Until 1914, Bombarral was a parish of the municipality of neighbouring Óbidos. The present-day municipality was created that year. Geography =Physical geography= Bombarral is situated in a privileged geographic region in the extreme southern part of the District of Leiria, in the centre of Western Tourist Region (), 75 kilometres from Lisbon and 20 kilometres from the Atlantic Ocean.

It was released on March 29, 1948, as a single by Capitol Records, and later appeared on the album, The Nat King Cole Story. The song was written in 1947 by eden ahbez and is partly autobiographical. It is a tribute to ahbez's mentor Bill Pester, who had originally introduced him to Naturmensch and Lebensreform philosophies, which ahbez practiced. When Cole was performing in 1947 at the Lincoln Theater, ahbez wanted to present the song to him, but was ignored. He left the copy with Cole's valet, and from him the singer came to know of \\"Nature Boy\\". After receiving appreciation for his performance of the song, Cole wanted to record it but needed consent from the writer. Eventually, he tracked down ahbez. The recording took place on August 22, 1947, and featured an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol—the in-house arranger of Capitol Records. He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song, to capture the \\"enchanting\\" vibe of the track. The lyrics are a self-portrait of ahbez and his life. The final line—\\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, Is just to love and be loved in return\\"—is considered a poignant moment in the song, with multiple interpretations of it. \\"Nature Boy\\" was released amidst the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) ban of 1948, but became commercially successful, reaching the top of the Billboard music charts and selling over a million copies, helping to establish the artist's solo career. Receiving critical acclaim also, \\"Nature Boy\\" helped to introduce Cole to a wider audience, especially the white music market, and generated royalties for ahbez. In 1999, the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame Award. However, \\"Nature Boy\\" was also the subject of lawsuits, with Yiddish composer Herman Yablokoff claiming that it was plagiarized from his song \\"\\" (, \\"Be Still My Heart\\"). In the end, ahbez and Yablokoff settled out of court. Following Cole's success with the song, rival record companies released cover versions of \\"Nature Boy\\" by other artists like Frank Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan, which were also successful. It ultimately became a pop and jazz standard, with many artists interpreting the song, including Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, who recorded it for their jazz collaborative album, Cheek to Cheek (2014). It was also used in numerous films like The Boy with Green Hair, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and the 2001 musical Moulin Rouge!, for which singer David Bowie recorded a version. Background and development In 1941, a 33-year-old George McGrew arrived in Los Angeles and began playing piano in the Eutropheon, a small health food store and raw food restaurant on Laurel Canyon Boulevard. The café was owned by John and Vera Richter, who followed a (nature person) and (life reform) philosophy influenced by the (Wandering Bird) movement in Germany. Their followers, known as \\"Nature Boys\\", wore long hair and beards and ate only raw fruits and vegetables. McGrew adopted the philosophy and chose the name \\"eden ahbez\\", writing and spelling his name with lower-case letters. It was there, while living in a cave near Palm Springs, that ahbez wrote \\"Nature Boy\\". Partly autobiographical, the song was a tribute to his mentor Bill Pester, who had originally introduced him to and . In 1947, at the prompting of Cowboy Jack Patton and Johnny Mercer, ahbez approached Nat King Cole's manager backstage at the Lincoln Theater in Los Angeles, handed him a tattered copy of \\"Nature Boy\\", and asked him to show it to Cole. However, his pleas were ignored and a disappointed ahbez left the sheet music of \\"Nature Boy\\" with Cole's valet, Otis Pollard. From him, Cole came to know of the song and loved it. Cole began playing \\"Nature Boy\\" for live audiences, and he received much acclaim. Irving Berlin, who was present during one of the performances, initially offered to buy the track from Cole, but Cole decided to record it for himself. He needed to get permission from ahbez, however, before releasing it as a single, but he was not able to find the songwriter since ahbez had disappeared without providing any contact details. After ahbez was discovered living under the Hollywood Sign, Cole got his permission and recorded the song. Recording and composition Cole's recording, which took place on August 22, 1947, featured an orchestra conducted by Frank De Vol—the in-house arranger of Capitol Records. He used strings and flute as instrumentation in the song, to capture the \\"enchanting\\" vibe of the track. The first two measures of the song's melody parallel the melody of the second movement in composer Antonín Dvořák's Piano Quintet No. 2 (1887). Written as a pop ballad, \\"Nature Boy\\" follows an \\"A,B\\" format, with the primary three notes descending on a minor triad above the pickup note. An ascending line over the diminished ii chord returns to the initial minor triad. The harmonic structure makes frequent use of the standard ii–V–I progression in the key of D minor. The second 4-bar section featured a chromatic descending line based on the lowering of the tonic (Dm–Dmmaj7–Dm7–Dm6). The same descending line then continues through Gm6–Dm, then finally ending with a whole-step down to the G in the chord Em75. The lyrics of the song relate to a 1940s Los Angeles-based group called \\"Nature Boys\\", a subculture of proto-hippies of which ahbez was a member. Instrumentalist Chris Tyle noted that the lyrics are a musical self- portrait of ahbez, with the lines like \\"There was a boy, A very strange, enchanted boy, They say he wandered very far, Very far, over land and sea\\". But he believed that it was the song's last line that made it the most poignant: \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn, Is just to love and be loved in return\\". Various interpretations of the line are given by academics, with the eponymous nature boy being a child, advising on love and relationship, or an adult hippie talking about his journey and inner-love. According to author Jeffrey P. Dennis, the song presented a homo-romantic theme, with the eponymous nature boy visiting Cole on a \\"magic day\\" and explaining that \\"the greatest thing you'll ever learn, is just to love and be loved in return\\". Author Raymond Knapp described the track as a \\"mystically charged vagabond song\\" whose lyrics evoked an intense sense of loss and haplessness, with the final line delivering a universal truth, described by Knapp as \\"indestructible\\" and \\"salvaged somehow from the perilous journey of life\\". According to Joe Romersa, an engineer/drummer in Los Angeles, to whom ahbez bequeathed master tapes, photos, and final works, ahbez wanted a correction made to the lyrics saying \\"To be loved in return, is too much of a deal, and there's no deal in love.\\", and that instead it should read \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved, just to love, and be loved.\\" Romersa has stated that, because these lyrics did not fit with the original ending melody, ahbez re-wrote it. Release and reception \\"Nature Boy\\" helped Nat King Cole to further popularize his singing career, and made him reach the white audience. In 1948, a second \\"Petrillo ban\\" on music recording were enforced by American Federation of Musicians (AFM) in response to the Taft–Hartley Act. Capitol Records was desperate to release something for sustaining any profit, and ultimately released \\"Nature Boy\\" as a single on March 29, 1948, with catalog number 15054. Crestview Music, which owned the publishing rights to Cole's songs, sold the rights for \\"Nature Boy\\" to Burke- Van Heusen, who acted as distributor and selling agent. The record debuted on the Billboard charts of April 16, 1948, and stayed there for 15 weeks, ultimately peaking at number one. It also reached a peak of number two on the R&B; charts. \\"Nature Boy\\" went on to sell a million copies in 1948 and Billboard DJs listed it as the greatest record of the year, with the song accumulating a total of 743 points. The 1940s, American music market was divided by race and for a black artist to cross over to mainstream pop music was difficult. Author Krin Gabbard noted in his book Jammin' at the Margins: Jazz and the American Cinema that Cole had to wear white makeup while filming for the performance of the song. Although he had come into prominence in 1930 as a leader of the jazz trio named King Cole Trio, it was with \\"Nature Boy\\" that he received widespread recognition, and it was his rendition that appealed to the white audience. Cole would later use the success of the song to cancel the trio and pursue a solo recording career; he later described \\"Nature Boy\\" as one of his favorites among his recordings.. Retrieved September 6, 2014. The success of the song allowed ahbez to accumulate about US$20,000 ($ in dollars) in royalty. However, Billboard reported that ahbez kept only 50% of the royalty for himself, and distributed the rest among people who had helped him in bringing the song to limelight. About 25% was shared with Mrs. Loraine Tatum for helping him with the lyrics and the rest with Pollard, for bringing the song to Cole's notice. \\"Nature Boy\\" has received wide acclaim from critics and contemporary reviewers. Author Ted Gioia noted in his book, The Jazz Standards: A Guide to the Repertoire, that all the musicians \\"who had created the golden age of American popular song had their quirks and idiosyncrasies, but eden ahbez demands pride and place as the most eccentric of them all\\". He added that along with promoting the hippie culture, with \\"Nature Boy\\", ahbez and Cole was able to introduce a new era of black artists in white popular music. In his book Sinatra! the Song is You: A Singer's Art, author Will Friedwald complimented Cole's version, saying that it had been the \\"startingly fresh\\" combination of the singer's vocals along with the string section, which had made \\"Nature Boy\\" a hit. Stephen Cook from AllMusic said that the song transformed Cole into \\"one of the most famous and beloved pop singing stars of the postwar years.\\" Billboard noted that such was the popularity of the song that audiences would only stay in theaters to see Cole perform \\"Nature Boy\\", and leave once he finished. A 1975 poll by the magazine listed it as the \\"Greatest All-Round Record\\" as well as the \\"Favorite Pop Recording\\" of the previous years. In 1999, the song was awarded the Grammy Hall of Fame, a special Grammy Award established in 1973 to honor recordings that are at least twenty-five years old and that have \\"qualitative or historical significance\\". Steve Erickson from Los Angeles magazine gave a detailed positive review of the song: > \\"Nature Boy\\" is so otherworldly in its melody and lyric that any number of > interpretations over the decades, from Nat Cole's to Alex Chilton's, have > never been able to make it ordinary. It sounds like something that, from the > minute it was written, existed out of time and place—all thousand and one > Arabian Nights compressed into two and a half minutes as mediated by a > cracked Mojave Debussy slugging down the last of the absinthe from his > canteen. Yiddish theatre composer Herman Yablokoff claimed in his biography, Memoirs of the Yiddish Stage, that the melody to \\"Nature Boy\\" was plagiarized from his song \\"Shvayg mayn harts\\" (\\"Hush My Heart\\"), which he wrote for his play Papirosn (1935). When met with a lawsuit in 1951 for the plagiarization, ahbez first proclaimed his innocence, and telephoned Yablokoff to explain that he \\"had heard the melody as if angels were singing it... in the California mountains. He offered me $10,000 to withdraw the suit. I said that the money was not important, but I wanted him to admit that the song was geganvet [stolen]; and if he heard angels, they must have bought a copy of my song.\\" Eventually ahbez's lawyers offered to have an out-of-court settlement, offering $25,000 ($ in dollars) to Yablokoff, which he accepted. Freidwald remarked that \\"it struck no one as ironic that a song with message of love and peace should come to symbolize how cutthroat the pop music business was becoming\\". Other versions The success of \\"Nature Boy\\" soon led to the release of a number of cover versions of the track. However, due to the AFM ban, other record companies could not release full versions with strings, only a cappella tracks. Following Cole's version of \\"Nature Boy\\", the Dick Haymes recording was released by Decca Records as catalog number 24439. The record first appeared on the Billboard charts on June 4, 1948, and peaked at number 11. Frank Sinatra also recorded a musicianless version, which was his only recording during the ban. Sinatra's version of \\"Nature Boy\\" replaced the string sounds of the original recording with a choir conducted by Jeff Alexander, which, according to Friedwald, made the song sound like a Gregorian chant. The recording was released by Columbia Records as catalog number 38210. It debuted on the Billboard charts on May 28, 1948, and peaked at number seven. Sinatra later performed the song on the radio show, Your Hit Parade, accompanied by a choir and orchestral arrangement. RCA Records planned to release versions by singers Perry Como and Bing Crosby, but they were subsequently cancelled due to the ban. Musicraft Records released Sarah Vaughan's a cappella version on April 8, 1948. It was a commercial success, selling 20,000 copies on the first day and peaking at number 11 on the Billboard chart. A parody named \\"Serutan Yob\\" was recorded by The Unnatural Seven, an offshoot of Red Ingle and his Natural Seven that did not include Ingle due to the 1948 AFM recording ban. \\"Serutan Yob\\" featured vocals from Karen Tedder and Los Angeles DJ Jim Hawthorne. It was released by Capitol with catalog number 15210, reached the Billboard charts on October 1, 1948, and stayed there for a total of four weeks, peaking at number 24. In 1955, Miles Davis recorded the song with Charles Mingus as bassist. The recording for the song was filled with tension due to an ongoing conflict between Davis and Mingus, resulting in a charged version of the song. They were assisted by Teddy Charles on vibraphone and Elvin Jones on drums. Another version was recorded by singer Bobby Darin, released in 1961 reached number 24 in the UK singles chart. A psychedelic rock version was recorded in 1965 by 1960s San Francisco rock band The Great Society, with lead vocals from singer Grace Slick, released on their 1968 post-breakup album How it Was. Same year, Marvin Gaye recorded and released his version on the Cole tribute album, A Tribute to the Great Nat \\"King\\" Cole. A version by George Benson reached number 26 in the UK singles chart in 1977 and in 1983 soul band Central Line reached number 21. Peggy Lee's version of \\"Nature Boy\\" was recorded in 1948, but released in 1995 as part of the compilation album, Why Don't You Do Right? Peggy Lee, 1947–1948. Johnny Hartman made a 1972 recording that was included on Blue Note's 1995 album For Trane. Abbey Lincoln recorded a version of the song for her 1995 album A Turtle's Dream. Howard Reich from the Chicago Tribune was impressed with the cover saying that \\"the mood of reverie and awe [that Lincoln] expresses in 'Nature Boy' epitomize this album's haunting appeal.\\" Celine Dion performed the song as part of her A New Day... concert at Caesars Palace. The song appeared on her 2002 studio album, A New Day Has Come, and on her 2004 live album, A New Day... Live in Las Vegas. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic said that the decision to include \\"Nature Boy\\" in A New Day Has Come was inspired by the song's appearance in Baz Luhrmann's musical, Moulin Rouge! (2001). With Billboard, Dion expressed her feelings while recording the track: \\"This is the one I had the most kick out of in the studio. I could hear the pedal of the piano and the touch of the keys while I was singing. We were following each other, this is the real thing. This was such my pleasure.\\" Initially strings and other instrumentation were added in post-production, but were later removed to maintain the simplicity of Cole's version. Aaron Neville's interpretation of the track was released in 2003 on his jazz standard album, titled Nature Boy: The Jazz Album. That year in December, Harry Connick, Jr. released a holiday themed rendition of \\"Nature Boy\\", on his holiday album, Harry for the Holidays. At the tenth season of American Idol, contestant Casey Abrams presented a jazz version of the song, which was received with a standing ovation from the audience, but faced criticism from the media for the \\"strange\\" musical arrangements. =Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga version= Gaga and Bennett performing \\"Nature Boy\\" on their Cheek to Cheek Tour, 2014 After recording the jazz standard \\"The Lady Is a Tramp\\", American singer Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga began working on a collaborative jazz album, titled Cheek to Cheek. The recording took place over a year in New York City, and featured jazz musicians associated with both artists. Bennett's quartet was present, including Mike Renzi, Gray Sargent, Harold Jones and Marshall Wood as well as pianist Tom Lanier. Along with Evans, jazz trumpeter Brian Newman, a long-time friend and colleague of Gaga, played on the album with his New York City based jazz quintet. Tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano and flautist Paul Horn were also enlisted as musicians. The songs were handpicked by Bennett and Gaga; they selected tracks from the Great American Songbook including \\"Nature Boy\\". It features instrumentation from flutes and drums, and has an orchestral arrangement. According to Kory Grow of Rolling Stone, Gaga sings in a Liza Minnelli inspired voice with a breathy range, followed by Bennett complimenting her with the story of meeting the titular character. \\"Nature Boy\\" was released for streaming on Gaga's Vevo channel from September 16, 2014. Preceding the release, Gaga tweeted about the background of the song, about the death of flautist Horn, as well as about ahbez, saying \\"This composer was part of a sub-culture of nomadic hippies! We channeled our own Gypsy lives in this performance\\". Gil Kaufman from MTV News gave a positive review, saying that \\"This song sounds like what you imagine a smoky jazz club in 1940s New York would feel like.\\" Grow praised it as \\"sublime\\", describing the track as a \\"loungier\\" version Gaga and Bennett's collaboration. Dave Lewis from HitFix believed that the \\"magic\\" of the song really happened once Bennett's vocals were heard, following Gaga's singing and the orchestration. Lewis said that \\"It's not exactly 'Do What You Want with My Body', but Gaga and Bennett generate a different kind of heat.\\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the song was \\"treated with the greatest delicacy\\". He praised the flute sounds and the contrast between Gaga's \\"vulnerable\\" vocals and Bennett's \\"assured\\" one. Alexa Camp from Slant Magazine gave a negative review, saying that her timbre in \\"Nature Boy\\" appeared inconsistent, \\"shifting from soft and almost pleasant to parodic and comical, often within just a few short bars.\\" \\"Nature Boy\\" reached number 22 on the Billboard Jazz Digital Songs chart. In Russia, it peaked at number 259 on the official Tophit airplay chart. Usage in films Singer David Bowie's version in Moulin Rouge! was critically appreciated The song was a primary theme of the film score for The Boy with Green Hair (1948), for which the original version was used. The producers of the film reportedly paid $10,000 to ahbez for using the song, which was cumulatively more than what the author of the story, Betsy Beaton, was paid. A recording by Kate Ceberano was featured in the film The Crossing (1990). The tune and lyrics feature prominently in the film Untamed Heart (1993), for which Cole's version was used during the closing credits, while a piano version by Roger Williams served as the opener for the film. The song was also played in intermediate scenes featuring the principal cast. Miles Davis' recording of \\"Nature Boy\\" was used in the film The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999). In the book Music, Movies, Meanings, and Markets: Cinemajazzamatazz, author Morris Holbrook described the song as a \\"nondiegetic performance\\", exemplifying the plot development and sexual tension in the scene featuring Matt Damon and Jude Law play chess, naked and later in a bathtub scene. The song is performed at a jazz club in the film Angel Eyes, (2001). A version recorded by Jon Hassell on trumpet and Ronu Majumdar on flute is featured on the soundtrack. The writing of \\"Nature Boy\\" was the theme of a 2000 Canadian TV film of the same title, directed by Kari Skogland. Callum Keith Rennie played ahbez, writing the song for Cole, played by Terence Carson, after falling in love with a woman named Anna Jacobs, portrayed by Tanya Allen. The song was a central theme in Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge! \\"Nature Boy\\" was initially arranged as a techno song with singer David Bowie's vocals, before being sent to the group Massive Attack, whose remix was used in the film's closing credits. Bowie described the rendition as \\"slinky and mysterious\\", adding that Robert '3D' Del Naja from the group had \\"put together a riveting piece of work,\\" and that Bowie was \\"totally pleased with the end result.\\" Both Bowie's version and Massive Attack's remix appeared on the soundtrack. The version used in Moulin Rouge! was sung by John Leguizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, during the introductory scenes, as well as by Ewan McGregor's character, Christian. Some of the film's premise was based on the lyrics, in particular the opening lines. The closing lyric, \\"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return\\" is used throughout the film. While reviewing Moulin Rouge!, Erickson noted that \\"[by] itself, ['Nature Boy'] redeems the wonderful idea behind Luhrmann's flawed but often wonderful movie.\\" The song was performed by Rodrigo Santoro in the film Heleno (2012), during the radio interview when he asks if he could sing a song for his wife and son. Cole's version was again played at the start of Mike Tyson's one-man show, Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth, directed by Spike Lee that aired on HBO. On December 25, 2016, 20th Century Fox released a teaser trailer for the British-American science-fiction horror film, Alien: Covenant, using a cover of \\"Nature Boy\\" by singer Aurora, as the background score.

Production and history This book was compiled towards the end of the 14th century at the castle of Ballymote for Tonnaltagh McDonagh, who was then in occupation of the castle. The chief compiler was Manus O'Duignan, one of a family who were ollavs and scribes to the McDonagh and the McDermots. Other scribes of the book were Solomon O'Droma, a member of a famous Co. Fermanagh family, and a Robert McSheedy. The book is a compilation of older works, mostly loose manuscripts and valuable documents handed down from antiquity that came into possession of McDonagh. The first page of the work contains a drawing of Noah's Ark as conceived by the scribe. The first written page is missing and the second opens with a description of the ages of the world. Patrick and his household; Cormac's instructions to a king; and a physical and geological survey of Ireland. Part of the work is devoted to the sagas of Finn and Brian Boru, and the Lebor na Cert (Book of Rights). It also contains treatises on metre and the profession of a poet, and on the Ogham writing and language. The book ends with several translations from the Greek: the destruction of Troy and the wanderings of Ulysses, followed by a resume of Virgil's 'Aeneid', beginning with Nestor's speech to the Greeks. The Book of Ballymote, like many of its kind, has made history by its wanderings. For over a hundred years it was a treasured possession of the McDonaghs of Corran. About the beginning of the 16th century, it fell into the possession of the O'Donnells with whom it remained until the Flight of the Earls in 1603. From 1620 until 1767 it was in the library of Trinity College, Dublin. It disappeared from the library and was later found in Burgundy, France. In 1785 it was returned to the Royal Irish Academy where it remained as one of the Academy's most treasured possessions. The work was photographed by the Academy in 1887 and two hundred copies of it were made. One copy is in the diocesan archives and others in libraries.

Paper at: Joint Organic Congress, Odense, Denmark, May 30–31, 2006 The aim of the principles is both to inspire the organic movement and to describe the purpose of organic agriculture to the wider world. Background The first set of principles of organic agriculture to be published by any organic association was a set of ten principles published by the Australian Organic Farming and Gardening Society (1944–1955).Paull, John \\"The Lost History of Organic Farming in Australia\\", Journal of Organic Systems, 2008, 3(2):2-17. The organic sector has grown significantly in recent years. Along with that growth have come opportunities and challenges. The IFOAM General Assembly concluded that there was a need to elaborate the basic values of organic agriculture. The principles are intended to \\"apply to agriculture in the broadest sense, including the way people tend soils, water, plants and animals in order to produce, prepare and distribute goods. They concern the way people interact with living landscapes, relate to one another and shape the legacy of future generations.\\" The principles The four Principles of Organic Farming are: *Organic farming should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plants, animals and humans as one and indivisible. *Organic farming should be based on the living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them. *Organic agriculture should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to common environment and life processes. *Organic farming should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well being of current and future generations and the environment.

Excluding Gille Christ he is counted as sixth Mormaer or Earl of Mar. In 1284 he joined with other Scottish noblemen who acknowledged Margaret of Norway as the heir to King Alexander III.Foedera, p228 Domhnall was later a strong supporter of the Bruce cause during the crisis of the late 13th century. He was at Norham in 1292, probably in the camp of Robert de Brus, then Earl of Carrick. He married to Helen (sometimes called Ellen), possibly the natural daughter of Llywelyn the Great of Wales, who herself had previously been married to Mormaer Maol Choluim II, Earl of Fife. By Helen, he had three sons, including his successor Gartnait, and two daughters. His daughter Isabella of Mar was the first wife of Robert I of Scotland and mother of Marjorie Bruce who married Walter, 6th High Steward, the parents of Robert II and the Royal Stewart Kings of Scotland. The last record of a living Domhnall comes from 1297, and the earliest record of his son Gartnait as Mormaer is from 1305, creating the range of Domhnall's possible year of death to somewhere in between these two points. However, a document dating to 1302, containing terms of reconciliation between Edward I and Robert, stipulates that Robert should act as warden of Gartnait, implying that Domhnall had just died.

The title character was one of the earliest blackface characters in the United States. He was based largely on the tall-tale riverboatsmen and frontiersmen characters that were popular in fiction during the Jacksonian Era. \\"Gumbo Chaff\\" merged these frontier elements with stereotypes of black slaves, creating a new character who lives \\"On de Ohio bluff in de state of Indiana\\" and who \\"jump into [his] kiff / And . . . down de river driff, / And . . . cotch as many cat fish as ever nigger liff.\\"Nathan 173.

His name is sometimes rendered as Gartney or Gratney. A son of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar, and his wife, Elen ferch Llywelyn, Gartnait of Mar died in about 1305. Support for Edward I, King of England During the Scottish war against King Edward I of England, Andrew Moray, son of Sir Andrew Moray of Petty, took action in the Highlands in 1297, besieging Urquhart Castle near Inverness, which was under the control of the English constable, Sir William FitzWarin. Moray failed in this attempt but moved on to Moray and Aberdeenshire. In response, Edward sent three Scottish nobles deemed favorable to him at the time to quell this rebellion—Henry le Chen, Bishop of Aberdeen; John Comyn, Earl of Buchan; and Gartnait of Mar, whose father had just been released from the Tower of London and was under oath to support King Edward. These three, along with Euphemia, Countess of Ross, engaged Moray near the River Spey on 17 July but, instead of apprehending him, allowed him to withdraw without pursuit. To explain themselves, they sent a letter to King Edward on 25 July, saying they had encountered “Andrew de Moray with a great body of rogues. . . and the aforesaid rogues betook themselves into a very great stronghold of bog and wood where no horseman could be of service.” To provide the king with details, the three sent Andrew de Rait with a letter of credence. Along the way, Rait met with Hugh de Cressingham, treasurer of the English administration in Scotland, and showed him the letter. Cressingham, however, seems not to have placed much confidence in the veracity of the letter and, on 5 August, told Edward “to give little weight to it, for it is false in many points and obscure, as will be well known hereafter, I fear.” Cressingham had the right of it, as Moray joined forces with Sir William Wallace and continued the struggle against the English king. Earldom Gartnait’s father, the 7th earl of Mar, died at Kildrummy Castle on 25 July 1297, the same day on which Chen’s letter to Edward was composed. The exact date on which Gartnait succeeded his father as earl of Mar is unknown, but it has been argued that this may have occurred soon after Gartnait’s mission in the north against Moray. There is no surviving document mentioning Gartnait as earl of Mar during his lifetime, but writs composed after his death refer to him thus. Family Though the wife of Gartnait of Mar has historically been identified as Christina Bruce, sister of Robert the Bruce, it is now argued that Mar married not Christina, but an elder sister of Robert. Mar and his wife were the parents of two children: * Helen of Mar, who married, first, Sir John Menteith, Lord of Arran, and, secondly, Sir James Garioch * Domhnhall, 9th Earl of Mar (d. 12 August 1332) Death The date of the death of Gartnait, earl of Mar, is not certain. However, since Robert the Bruce as earl of Carrick was holding Kildrummy Castle in 1305, it has been suggested that Mar died before then and that Carrick was, at that time, the guardian of his nephew, the Earl’s heir.

It is composed of the Prime Minister, who is the head of government, and both junior and senior ministers. Senior ministers are titled as Ministers (), whereas junior ministers are titled as Secretaries of State (). The Council of Ministers is the main executive organ of the government, established in the Constitution and presided over by the President of the Republic.  Composition and formation  All members of the French government are appointed by the President of the Republic on the advice of the Prime Minister.Constitution of the French Republic (Title II, Article 8) Members of the government are ranked in a precise order, which is established at the time of government formation. In this hierarchy, the Prime Minister is the head of government. He is appointed by the President of the Republic. While the President is constitutionally free to appoint whomever he likes, in practice, he must nominate a candidate that reflects the will of the majority of the National Assembly, as the government is responsible to the French Parliament. After being nominated to lead a government, the Prime Minister nominee must propose a list of ministers to the President. The President can either accept or reject these proposed ministers. Ministers are ranked by importance: *Ministers of State () are senior ministers and are members of the Council of Ministers. It is an honorary rank, granted to some Ministers as a sign of prestige. *Ministers () are senior ministers and are members of the Council of Ministers. They lead government ministries. *Secretaries of State () are junior ministers. This is the lowest rank in the French ministerial hierarchy. Secretaries work directly under a Minister, or sometimes directly under the Prime Minister. While the Council of Ministers does not include Secretaries of State as members, Secretaries may attend meetings of the Council if their portfolio is up for discussion. Functions According to the Constitution of the French Fifth Republic, the government directs and decides the policy of the nation.Constitution of the French Republic (Title III, Article 20) In practice, the government writes bills to be introduced to parliament, and also writes and issues decrees. All political decisions made by the government must be registered in the government gazette. =Council of Ministers= The Council of Ministers () is established by the Constitution. It is composed only of the senior ministers, though some Secretaries of State may attend Council meetings. The Council of Ministers is chaired by the President, unlike the government, but is still led by the Prime Minister, who was officially titled as the President of the Council of Ministers () during the Third and Fourth Republics. All bills and some decrees must be approved by the Council of Ministers. Furthermore, it is the Council of Ministers that defines the collective political and policy direction of the government, and takes practical steps to implement that direction. In addition to writing and implementing policy, the government is responsible for national defense, and directs the actions of the French Armed Forces. The workings of the government of France are based on the principle of collegiality. Meetings of the Council of Ministers take place every Wednesday morning at the Élysée Palace. They are presided over by the President of the Republic, who promotes solidarity and collegiality amongst government ministers.Constitution of the French Republic (Title II, Article 9) These meetings follow a set format. In the first part of a meeting, the Council deliberates over general interest bills, ordinances, and decrees. In the second part, the Council discusses individual decisions by each Minister regarding the appointment of senior civil servants. In the third part, usually, either one Minister will give a presentation about some reform or project that he or she is directing, or the President will ask for advice on some subject from the Ministers. In addition, the Minister of Foreign Affairs provides the Council with weekly updates on important international issues. =Ministries= Most government work, however, is done elsewhere. Much of it is done by each individual ministry, under the direction of the Minister responsible for that ministry. Ministers each have their own staff, called a \\"ministerial cabinet\\" (). Each ministerial cabinet consists of around ten to twenty members, who are political appointees. Cabinet members assist the Minister in running a ministry. Members of ministerial cabinets are powerful figures within the government and work in both the political and administrative spheres. The hierarchy in each ministerial cabinet is determined by the Minister. Working groups consisting of representatives from several ministries are commonplace. It is the duty of the Prime Minister to oversee these inter-ministry meetings and to ensure that government work is done effectively and efficiently. =Budget= The government is responsible for the economic and financial policy of the French Republic, must authorize all expenditures made by each ministry, and also manage all revenue. Expenditures are made through what is called a \\"finance law\\" (), which is equivalent to an appropriation bill. Each minister must prepare a list of requests for funds annually, and submit it to the Budget Ministry. This ministry decides whether to grant or deny requests for funding by ministers. The ministry also calculates the state budget for the coming year. The parliament must vote on all applications of finance law. Separation of powers Members of the French Government cannot occupy any position of occupational or trade leadership at the national level, any public employment, or any professional activity.Constitution of the French Republic (Title III, Article 23) These restrictions are in place to alleviate external pressure and influence on ministers, and to enable them to focus on their governmental work. Despite these restrictions, members of the government are allowed to keep local elected positions, such as those of city mayor or regional councilor. Whilst the Constitution of the French Republic does not prohibit ministers from being the leader of a political party, it is customary that ministers should not occupy such a post. The government is responsible for the French Parliament. In particular, the government must assume responsibility for its actions before the National Assembly, and the National Assembly can dismiss the government with a motion of censure.Constitution of the French Republic (Title V, Article 49) The government cannot function during the tenure of acting (interim) president, as that position is granted either to the President of the Senate or the Prime Minister, compromising separation of powers. If the government decides to launch an armed operation with a duration of longer than four months, it must first consult parliament and request an authorization.Constitution of the French Republic (Title V, Article 35) The Prime Minister may convene parliament for extraordinary sessions, or add additional sitting days to the legislative calendar.Constitution of the French Republic (Title IV, Articles 28 and 29) Current government =Ministries= The names of ministries change often in France. This is a list of current ministries: * Ministry of the Interior * Ministry for the Ecological Transition * Ministry of Justice * Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs * Ministry of the Armed Forces * Ministry of Territorial Cohesion * Ministry of Solidarity and Health * Ministry of the Economy and Finance * Ministry of Culture * Ministry of Labour * Ministry of National Education and Youth * Ministry of Agriculture and Food * Ministry of Public Action and Accounts * Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation * Ministry of the Overseas * Ministry of Sports  References  External links * France ","title":"Government of France"},{"id":"3398118","text":"The is a small river in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, a right tributary of the Neckar.

Her paternal uncle Antony Chiramel Mankidiyan was her godfather and his wife Anna was the godmother. Her family was once rich though became poor when her grandfather married off seven daughters after selling property for each costly dowry; this led to her brothers and her father taking up drinking. Her mother was her father's second wife; her father's first wife Mariamkutty died during childbirth in 1872. She had two sisters and two brothers and were in exact order: Porinchu, Mariamkutty, Ouseph and Ittianam – she was born in between Mariamkutty and Ouseph. In 1884 her mother tried in vain to dissuade the pious girl from her severe fasts and night vigils. Her mother died on 2 March 1888 after blessing her children who gathered at her deathbed. Her mother's death marked the conclusion of her studies and she instead dedicated herself to contemplation in her local parish church. She made a private vow to remain chaste in 1886. In 1891 she hatched a scheme to sneak from home to lead a life of penance in the hills but soon decided against this and instead returned home. Since 1904 she desired to be called \\"Mariam\\" under the belief she had a vision from the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she was instructed to add it to her name. From 1902 to 1905 she was subjected to several exorcisms from Venerable Joseph Vithayathil – under the orders of the local bishop – and from 1902 it was Vithayathil who became her spiritual director until her death. In 1903 she requested Mar John Menachery – the Archbishop of Thrissur – to build a house of retreat but it was turned down. This happened after she had formed a group with three other friends and engaged in apostolic work with poor families. Menachery instead suggested she make an effort to join a religious congregation and encouraged her to join the new Congregation of the Franciscan Clarists but left since she didn't feel called to it. Mankidiyan later accepted the mar's request in 1912 to join the Carmelites at Ollur and was there since November 26, 1912 until she left on 27 January 1913 because she did not feel drawn to them either. In 1913 she set up a house at Puthenchira and on 14 May 1914 founded the Congregation of the Holy Family to which she was professed in and vested in its habit; she was the first superior of the order. Stigmata She was said to have had a range of spiritual experiences such as receiving the stigmata and hid this from public view; she first had this in 1905 though became more visible on 27 January 1909. She also purportedly suffered a series of demonic attacks. In 1926 a falling object struck her on the leg and the wound soon festered. Mankidiyan was admitted to the local hospital though doctors deemed her condition fatal and she was moved by bullock cart back to her convent where on 7 June 1926 she received the final sacraments and the Viaticum. Death She died at 10 pm on 8 June 1926 from her leg wound that her diabetes exacerbated. Her final words were: \\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph; I give you my heart and my soul\\" – she then closed her eyes and died. On the morning of her death she was laid on the floor on a mat at her request with her spiritual director and fellow religious huddled around her. Her funeral was celebrated on 9 June and in accordance with her wishes her remains were not washed prior to her funeral. Canonization The beatification process opened in Irinjalakuda on 12 July 1982 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints (C.C.S.) titled her as a Servant of God and issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (nothing against) to the cause while the cognitional process opened on 14 May 1983 and concluded its business on 24 September 1983; the C.C.S. later validated the process after its conclusion in Rome on 8 November 1985 and received the Positio dossier from the postulation a decade later in 1997. The board of historians met to assess the cause and to determine if historical obstacles existed before issuing their approval for the cause on 27 May 1997 at which point the theologians approved it on 9 October 1998 as did the C.C.S. on 19 April 1999. Pope John Paul II named the late religious as Venerable on 28 June 1999 after he confirmed that she had lived a life of heroic virtue. The investigation of the miracle required for beatification was held in the Trissur eparchy from 28 April 1992 to 26 July 1993 and was validated on 22 January 1999 before receiving the approval of the medical board on 16 November 1999. Theologians then voiced their own approval on 5 January 2000 . The miracle was that of the cure of one Mathew D. Pellissery, who was born in 1956 with congenital club feet. He could barely walk with great difficulty on the sides of his feet until he was fourteen. After 33 days of fasting and prayer by the whole family, invoking the help of Mariam Thresia, his right foot was straightened during sleep on the night of 21 August 1970. Similarly after 39 days of fasting and prayer his left foot was also straightened overnight during sleep on 28 August 1971. Since then, Mathew has been able to walk normally. This double healing was declared inexplicable in terms of medical science by as many as nine doctors in India and Italy and thus met the last canonical requirement for her beatification. It was declared a miracle obtained through the intercession of Mariam Thresia by the C.C.S. on 18 January 2000 before the Pope himself issued final approval on it on 27 January 2000. John Paul II beatified Mariam Thresia on 9 April 2000 in Saint Peter's Square. Mathew Pellissery was present there during the beatification ceremony at St. Peter's Square. The second miracle – and the one needed for her canonization – was investigated in the diocese of its origin and later received the formal validation of the C.C.S. in Rome on 24 June 2014. The miraculous healing of the child Christopher received approval from the medical board in Rome in March 2018 and theologians later confirmed it in October 2018. Pope Francis approved this miracle on 12 February 2019 which cleared her for canonization; it was celebrated on 13 October 2019. The postulator for this cause was the Jesuit priest George Nedungatt.

Located in Oak Hill, Ohio, it was founded by a group of Welshmen led by Thomas. T. Jones and John D. Davis. Management was paid a rate of $500 to $600 a year while the workers were paid $0.80 to $1.25 an hour ($1670-2610/yr, for the current federal standard of 2087 hours in a full-time work year). During the American Civil War, much of the iron it produced was used to make the famous Union warship the Monitor, as well as the seven-ton guns at Harper's Ferry. The last use of the Jefferson Furnace was at 11:40 p.m. on December 26th, 1916, when the final cast was poured.

He retired from teaching in 1979. =Fandom= Rothman was an active science fiction fan from an early age. Besides co-founding the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society, he also organized the first Philcon science fiction convention in October 1936. The event consisted of 9 people, including future science fiction author/editors Frederik Pohl and Donald A. Wollheim, and was held, in part, in Rothman's home. It is often cited as the world's first science-fiction convention, although that is disputed. Rothman also published his fanzine \\"Milty's Mag\\" sporadically over a few years in the early forties. Later Rothman chaired the 1947 and 1953 Philcons. The first Hugo award was presented at the 1953 Philcon.

His weapons have been subjects of mythical adoration. According to legends, his sword was so heavy that only his arm could wield it. It was also said to be so sharp that it could slice a man vertically from head to waist with little effort and cut a huge boulder in half with a single blow. Of all of Skanderbeg's belongings, but four objects remain: two swords, a helmet, and a prayer book. Currently the weapons (helmet and swords) are on display in the Collection of Arms and Armour at the Neue Burg (affiliated with the Kunsthistorisches Museum) in Vienna after having passed through the hands of countless noblemen since the 15th century when they were first brought over to Italy from Albania by Skanderbeg’s wife, Donika Kastrioti. The prayer book is archived at the Shelley Publishing House in Chelsea, London in England. The swords The straight sword on display in Vienna. The sheath of the straight sword. According to Dhimitër Frëngu, Skanderbeg's scribe and one of his biographers, the first sword was curved (In the original Italian: una schimitarra storta), with a sharp edge and elegantly made of Damascened steel. There are also accounts which report that at one point he kept two swords sheathed in the same scabbard. Frengu then adds, rather colourfully, that Skanderbeg brought a master sword-maker over from Italy, who produced three better swords for him. One of them, \\"that could cut through steel,\\" he sent it as a present to the Ottoman Sultan. It is also known that in Skanderbeg's last visit to the Holy See, Pope Paul II presented the Albanian hero with a sword and a cap (It: una spada ed un elmo). The straight sword, which lies at the Museum of Ambras along with the helmet, is double-edged. The blade is dressed in gold. It is 85.5 centimeters long, 5.7 cm wide, and weighs 1.3 kilograms. Its scabbard is made of leather. According to Faik Konitza, who viewed the sword at the beginning of the 20th century, there were still stains of blood on the blade. On the other hand, the curved sword, including the hilt, measures 121 cm in length and weighs 3.2 kg. This sword is fashioned after Ottoman styles of the time, and just as Dhimiter Frengu reported five centuries earlier, is a damascene steel, highly ornamented. There is an inscription in Turkish, which according to Faik Konica is not correct. The inscription reads: (Libehadur Allah Iskander beg – Champion of God, Skanderbeg). Still, according to Faik Konica, only the blade belongs to the original sword held by Skanderbeg. The hilt, dressed in silver, and the velvet scabbard belong to a subsequent time. Both swords were reproduced in Vienna, for exclusive display in Tirana. Of these two swords, the one which Skanderbeg used in times of war could have been the curved one. The straight sword was rather short for his tall frame, whereas the other one afforded the flexibility required for cavalry charges and the fighting style of the day. In addition, having been trained in Turkey, and having learned there his skills in martial arts, it is more likely that he would have been more comfortable with that sword. The helmet The helmet of Skanderbeg. The helmet, seen from the front. Skanderbeg’s helmet is made of white metal, adorned with a strip dressed in gold. On its top lies the head of a horned goat made of bronze, also dressed in gold. The bottom part bears a copper strip adorned with a monogram separated by rosettes * IN * PE * RA * TO * RE * BT *, which means: Jhezus Nazarenus * Principi Emathie * Regi Albaniae * Terrori Osmanorum * Regi Epirotarum * Benedictat Te (Jesus Nazarene Blesses Thee [Skanderbeg], Prince of Emathia (the central region of Albania called Mat), King of Albania, Terror of the Ottomans, King of Epirus). It is thought that the copper strip with the monogram is the work of the descendants of Skanderbeg and was placed there by them, as Skanderbeg never held any other title but “Lord of Albania” (): It should be said however that the correct Latin translation of Regi is Kingdom since it is Rex that refers to King. Thus the inscriptions on the helmet may refer to the unsettled name by which Albania was known at the time, as a means to identify Skanderbeg's leadership over all Albanians across regional denominative identifications. Contemporary sources show that 14th century Albanians were invariably identified as tribal people, with no state of their own. Thus, depending on where they lived - North or South, in the plains or in the mountains, and to which civilization they subscribed to - we have Turkish: Arnaut, Greek: Arbanas, Arbanensis, Italian: Albanian, Epirotarum, Albanensis, Albanian: Arber, Arben, Arberesh,Jens-Schmitt, Oliver. \\"Arberia Vendike (1392-1479)\\" [Das Venezianische Albanien (1392-1479)]. Tirane: K&B;, 2007. 63-85. . According to a report by historian Shefqet Pllana, Sami Frasheri in his Kamus-al-Alam maintains that the wording \\"Dhu lKarnejn\\" (owner of the two horns) was an appellative attributed to Alexander the Great of Macedon, the very name which Skanderbeg bore in the Islamic form. At the request of the pre-WWII Albanian government, an identical copy of the helmet of Skanderbeg lies now in the National Museum of Tirana, Albania. The copy was manufactured by an Austrian master in 1937. The helmet is depicted on the reverse of the Albanian 5000 lekë banknote, issued since 1996.Bank of Albania. Currency: Banknotes in circulation . – Retrieved on 23 March 2009. The long journey of the weapons The helmet and swords have a dark and confusing history. After the death of Skanderbeg, they were taken to Italy by Skanderbeg’s wife Donika and his son Gjoni. Who inherited them after their death is unknown. The weapons reappeared in the last decade of the 16th century. By 1590 the helmet and one sword were under the ownership of Count Eolfang of Sturnberg while the other sword lay in the inventory of the Arms Museum of the Archduke Karl of Styria, son of the Holy Roman Emperor in Graz, Austria (they appear in the inventory of 30 October 1590). The person who brought the weapons together was the son of the Emperor and brother of Karl, Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol, who, acting under the advice of his Chancellor Jacob Schrenk von Gotzing, bought the weapons and brought them under the same roof. Later, this prince erected the Museum of Ambras, near Tyrol, which he filled with all sorts of war-related material, as well as paintings and portraits of celebrities of that age. In 1806 the weapons were transferred to the Imperial Museum in Vienna, still apart from each other. The helmet and the straight sword were placed in the Maximilian Hall (hall XXV, no. 71 & 92 respectively), whereas the curved sword found its way to the Karl V Hall (hall XXVII, no. 345). The weapons were separated by the curators of the museum, who were uncertain whether or not the swords indeed belonged to Skanderbeg. After the Second World War, the doubts evaporated. On the eve of Skanderbeg’s 500th anniversary, the arms were reunited, not only in the same hall, but in the same display window of the Neue Burg Collection of Arms and Armour in Vienna.  In Albania  The arms were returned to Albania in November 2012 as part of the 100th Anniversary of the Independence of Albania.http://albparajsa.com/lajme/lajme/mberrine-shpata.html Notes References Sources * *Kristo Frasheri, Skenderbeu: Jeta dhe Vepra (Tirane: Botimet Toena, 2002), 258-263 External links * Scanderbeg's helmet and Sword in Austrian Museum * Prunkhelm (in German) * Orientalisches Schwert (in German) Category:Warfare by Skanderbeg Category:Crown jewels Category:National symbols of Albania ","title":"Arms of Skanderbeg"},{"id":"3398297","text":"Sharyland High School is a high school in Mission, Texas, United States.

The single contains the songs \\"Real Emotion\\" and \\"1000 no Kotoba\\", which were featured in the game Final Fantasy X-2. This was Kumi's first single to chart in the top 10 on Oricon, coming in at No. 3. Since its release, it has sold over 283,000 copies. Background and release \\"Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba\\" is Japanese R&B; singer-songwriter Kumi Koda's seventh single and first double A-side. The single became the artist's first the chart in the top ten on the weekly Oricon Singles Charts, charting at No. 3, and remained on the charts for twenty-eight weeks. Since its release, it has sold over 283,000 copies. She would not have another single surpass the physical sales of \\"Real Emotion/1000 no Kotoba\\" until her 2006 single \\"4 Hot Wave\\". \\"1000 no Kotoba\\" was arranged by Takahito Eguchi and Noriko Matsueda, who arranged much of the music for Final Fantasy X-2. It was published by Rhythm Zone on March 5, 2003, with the catalog number \\"RZCD-45080\\". An orchestra version was included in limited editions of her album Grow into One as a bonus track, which played during the credits of Final Fantasy X-2. The song was also included on the game's soundtrack, Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack. An alternate orchestra version was included on her 2007 compilation album Best: Bounce & Lovers. Concerning the single's release, Kumi had said, \\"If this song doesn’t sell, it means that I don’t have what it takes to be an artist. If that happens, then I’ll give up with good grace.\\" After the chart failures of her past singles, Koda Kumi decided that the single would decide her fate as an artist. When the single had a high success rate on the charts, Kumi felt that it was the starting point of her career, but grew discouraged when the following singles didn't chart well, saying, \\"Once people will listen to my songs, I will certainly be able to keep their interest.\\" Because my hopes had been so high, the fall was really too hard.\\" On November 18, 2003, a Final Fantasy X-2 single was released under Avex with the title \\"Kuon: Memories of Waves and Light\\" in November of the same year. The single contained three tracks: \\"Kuon: Memories of Waves and Light\\", \\"Besaid\\", and \\"Yuna's Ballad\\". Shortly after the release of Kuon ~Memories of Light and Waves~, a Taiwanese bootlegging company known as Alion International Records Co.,LTD unofficially released a single with an identical title. The bootleg was distributed on several sites in the early 2000s. An orchestra version of \\"1000 no Kotoba\\" would be placed on limited editions of the corresponding album, Grow into One, as a bonus track. This was the version of the song used during the ending credits, which could also be found on disc two of the Final Fantasy X-2 Original Soundtrack. She would release an alternate orchestra version on her third compilation album, Best ~Bounce & Lovers~, which was released in 2007. Music video \\"Real Emotion\\" had a music video, appearing in the DVD 7 Spirits, and released alongside her corresponding album Grow into One. This would be the first time an artist took part in creating the dance for a video game, with Kumi's dance being digitized into the game for the opening number. The music video showed aspects of creating the in-game video, with Kumi on the platform that would be used to track her movements, so as to layer them over the Yuna character. =Appearance in Final Fantasy X-2= \\"Real Emotion\\" was used as the opening song for the Square Enix role-playing video game Final Fantasy X-2, with the dance Kumi performed being overlapped and digitized onto the Yuna character. While \\"1000 no Kotoba\\" was considered an a-side, the song did not receive an official music video. Instead, it received a music video in the game. The music video for the song was of the Yuna character singing the song in the Thunder Plains in the world of Spira. In the segment, Yuna sings the love song, written by the character Lenne, to her lover, Shuyin – both who had died 1000 years ago in Zanarkand.

In Venezuela, the Hiwi live in the states of Apure, Guarico, Bolivar, and Amazonas. Seventeenth- and eighteenth-century historians described the Hiwi as nomadic hunter-gatherers. Their long history of violent conflict, extending well into the twentieth century, has meant dramatic changes in their way of life. Today, when the Hiwi visit criollo towns, they wear European-style clothing: shirts and pants for the men, and cotton dresses for the women. In their own villages, many continue to wear traditional loincloths made of cloth or of a vegetable bark called marima. Traditional clothing also includes body ornaments. The Hiwi make necklaces of glass beads as well as shamanic amulet necklaces for ceremonial use, made with animal teeth, hooves, and beaks. Textile crafts are an important part of their material culture. Using looms, the Hiwi weave high-quality hammocks with moriche or cumare fibers. Historically, basketry has been a male occupation among the Hiwi, and the baskets they weave for transporting and storing foodstuffs are decorated with red and black geometric designs. Recently, women have begun to make baskets for commercial sale. Some Hiwi still make pottery, although far fewer since the introduction of aluminum pots and plastic containers. Traditionally an activity of the dry season, vessels are made by rolling rings of clay over a base. After they dry, they are burned over an open fire and then decorated with vegetable dyes such as cumare and caruto. Despite a reputation as less than excellent navigators, the Hiwi do make curiaras and oars. The curiaras are made from a tree similar to the cedar. After the bark is removed, they use fire, hatchets, and machetes to shape the wood. From the same wood, they produce oars with round handles and oval paddles. Although made by hand, the completed curiara looks newly manufactured. The Hiwi make wind and percussion musical instruments for festivities and ceremonial rituals, such as flutes with three holes made from large deer bones. Pan flutes, made with five or six tubes of caña amarga, often are played with another musical instrument made from the skull and antlers of the deer. The maraca, the shaman’s principal musical instrument, is traditionally used for healing. The body of a maraca is made from a dried gourd, which is then painted with geometric patterns. It is often decorated as well with a tuft of curassow feathers.

The field first emerged in venues like the journal Social Studies of Science by scholars working in science and technology studies and communication studies; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, sound art, deaf studies, architecture, and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a \\"soundscape\\", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in Western philosophy and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book \\"The Audible Past\\", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts, Jacques Attali's \\"Noise\\" (1985) and R. Murray Schafer's \\"The Soundscape\\" (1994). Initial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently, the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to race, gender, and colonialism. Hearing and listening Two significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schafer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%. For the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a venn diagram, with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement. Three modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning. Spaces, sites and scapes Sound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe \\"a total appreciation of the sonic environment,\\" and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand \\"the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change\\". In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real. Schafer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise. Transduce and record Our perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before. Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening. In a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation. What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly. Part of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as \\"telephonic:\\" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a \\"point of audition\\" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity. This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.  See also  * Audiophile References Further reading * R.

His father, Charles Jocelyn Hambro, was a merchant banker who was descended from Robert the Bruce. His mother, Pamela Cobbold, of the East Anglian brewing family, who also claimed royal descent via George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle, died when he was 21 months old. He grew up at Delcombe Manor in Dorset.Pamela Hambro and the lost world of Milton Abbey, Dorset Life, December 2009 After his mother's death, his stepmother became Dorothy Mackay, who was banker Marcus Wallenberg's ex- wife.

In a stepwise reaction, not all bonds are broken and formed at the same time. Hence, intermediates appear in the reaction pathway going from the reactants to the products. A stepwise reaction distinguishes itself from an elementary reaction in which the transformation is assumed to occur in a single step and to pass through a single transition state.IUPAC Gold Book definition Many other terminologies are used for stepwise reactions: overall reaction, global reaction, apparent reaction, operational reaction, complex reaction, composite reaction, multiple step reaction, multistep reaction, etc. In contrast to elementary reactions which follow the law of mass action, the rate law of stepwise reactions is obtained by combining the rate laws of the multiple elementary steps, and can become rather complex. Moreover, when speaking about catalytic reactions, the diffusion may also limit the reaction. In general, however, there is one very slow step, which is the rate-determining step, i.e. the reaction doesn't proceed any faster than the rate-determining step proceeds. Organic reactions, especially when involving catalysis, are often stepwise. For example, a typical enol reaction consists of at least these elementary steps: #Deprotonation next to (α to) the carbonyl: HC-C=O → C=C-O- #Attack of enolate: Rδ+ \\\\+ C=C-O- → R-C-C=O Rδ+ is an electron acceptor, for example, the carbon of a carbonyl (C=O). A very strong base, usually an alkoxide, is needed for the first step. Reaction intermediates may be trapped in a trapping reaction. This proves the stepwise nature of the reaction and the structure of the intermediate. For example, superacids were used to prove the existence of carbocations.

Bānbishn was a Middle Persian title meaning \\"queen\\", and was held by royal women in Sasanian Iran who were the king's daughters and sisters, and also by the consorts of the Sasanian princes that ruled parts of the country as governors. The full version of the title was bānbishnān bānbishn (\\"Queen of Queens\\"). Etymology Although the Old Persian form of bānbishn is not found in any source, it was most likely spelled māna-pashnī, matching the Avestan dəmąnō.paθnī (\\"mistress\\"), which is from Old Iranian dmāna-paθnī. The word was later absorbed into the Armenian language, where it was spelled bambishn. The Sogdian version of the word is bāmbusht.  History  In the Sasanian inscriptions, banbishn is the female equivalent of shah (king). The title is first attested in 262/3 in Shapur I's inscription at the Ka'ba-ye Zartosht, being held by a certain Denak. Shapur I's daughter Adur-Anahid held the title of bānbishnān bānbishn (\\"Queen of Queens\\"), which matched the title of shahanshah (\\"King of Kings\\"). Other titles related to banbishn were; shahr banbishn (\\"Queen of the empire\\"), held by Shapur I's wife Khwarranzem; sagan banbishn (\\"Queen of the Sakas\\") held by Shapurdukhtak, the wife of Narseh; and Meshan banbishn (\\"Queen of Meshan\\"), held by another Denak, the wife of Shapur Meshanshah.

Sherred (August 27, 1915 - April 16, 1985) was an American science fiction writer. Sherred was the author of a slim body of science fiction, consisting of a collection of stories, a novel, and the beginning of a novel that was completed by another author after Sherred's death in 1985. Sherred's stories were often set in Detroit and featured the down-to-earth laborers with whom the author was acquainted through his career in the automotive field, where he advanced from tool rooms to technical writing and public relations. He published few works of fiction, but his novella \\"E for Effort\\" (1947), about a time viewer, was voted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame. Algis Budrys wrote, \\"With one story, 'E for Effort', in the ASF [Astounding Science Fiction] of the wartime Forties, he handed the field such a knock that many old plinths are still loose in their sockets.\\" Sherred published his only novel, Alien Island, in 1970. A darkly humorous tale, Alien Island revolves around the devastating events that occur when aliens covertly inhabit Earth. Budrys found it disappointing, saying \\"It reads padded, uncoordinated, and unintentionally whimsical.\\"\\"Galaxy Bookshelf\\", Galaxy, June 1970, p.27-29 At his death in 1985, Sherred left an unfinished sequel to Alien Island, which author Lloyd Biggle, Jr. completed and published as Alien Main. Set on Earth some two hundred years after aliens had nearly destroyed life on the planet, the novel finds descendants of the aliens returning to atone for the atrocities committed by their ancestors. They find that the inhabitants of Earth are now living in tribes, with no connections except for a common belief in a goddess, whose return they await. While reviewer Gerald Jonas deemed Alien Main \\"not very ambitious,\\" he nevertheless found the work offers a \\"pleasant blend of surprise and predictability,\\" concluding: \\"Books such as this are the nourishing bread and butter of science fiction.\\"Jonas, Gerald, \\"Science Fiction,\\" New York Times, 9 September 1985].

A pioneer of modern rock climbing, he was also one of the fathers of sports medicine and physical medicine and rehabilitation and was elected to the U.S. National Ski Hall of Fame in 1974.  Career  Born in the future nation of Italy, then a part of the 1867–1918 Austro-Hungarian Empire, Kraus attended medical school in Vienna in the 1920s, against his father's wishes, becoming an orthopedic surgeon. Through his subsequent practice he developed a philosophy of treatment at odds with traditional medicine of the time. He would evolve this method, called \\"immediate mobilization\\", over his entire medical career. Passing his medical exams in New York, Kraus continued developing unique methods of fracture treatment, applying them to all kinds of athletes. He became especially well known in skiing circles. In the 1950s, Kraus was behind a push by the Appalachian Mountain Club to regulate climbing in the Shawangunks, and to install a safety code to prevent climbing accidents. This safety code led to conflicts with Lester Germer and The Vulgarians, and was later abandoned. Kraus warned Americans that children were not getting enough exercise and were watching too much television. Along with Bonnie Prudden, he campaigned for better physical exercise programs for children, and authored several books on exercise, sports medicine, and physical therapy. Eisenhower championed Kraus and his campaign to get Americans to exercise. However, by 1957, it was clear that Kraus was unsuccessful. Kraus was broadly opposed by the AMA and gym teachers (who felt Kraus was disparaging to their leadership) and many Americans, as Sports Illustrated reported in 1957, who worried that mandatory exercise programs for children would \\"Hitlerize American youth.\\"Sports Illustrated – \\"A Measure of Fitness.\\" – Sports IllustratedSports Illustrated  August 5, 1957  \\"A Measure of Fitness.\\"  Dorthy Stull Kraus also continued to develop a unique approach to treating back pain in collaboration with another doctor, Sonja Weber. They developed an understanding of the underlying causes of back pain and devised the Kraus–Weber test (also called K–W test) and exercises to alleviate it. Kraus was an associate professor at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center College of Medicine. His studies on children led to President Dwight D. Eisenhower establishing the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. In October 1961, Kraus became President Kennedy's secret White House back doctor.An exercise guru helped ease JFK's back pain – The Boston Globe The story of Kennedy's back had never prior been reported, although there was much speculation; but Kraus and Kennedy's two other White House doctors had sworn confidentiality. In April 2006, over ten years after Kraus's death, Kraus's widow donated Kraus's White House medical records on Kennedy to the Kennedy Library. They are now available to historians as well as the general public.Hans Kraus, M.D. (#345) – John F. Kennedy Presidential Library & Museum Additionally, some of author Susan E.B. Schwartz’s book interview tapes of Hans Kraus are also archived in the Kennedy Library and available for research. Kraus's medical records show that by the time of Kennedy's death in Dallas, Kraus's therapy had nearly cured Kennedy of his lifelong back pain.New Finding Reveals President John F. Kennedy's New Exercise Routine Was Healing His Back Pain Kraus's White House medical records also contain several entries about Kennedy's back corset, which he had worn since Harvard. Kraus recorded that he had grown convinced that the corset was impeding Kennedy's recovery and that Kennedy needed to permanently stop wearing it. In October 1963, Kennedy told Kraus that he would stop wearing his corset indefinitely starting in January 1964. Several leading presidential historians, including James Reston and Robert Dallek, have theorized that Kennedy might have survived Dallas had he not been wearing his corset.The Standard – How steel back brace made JFK a sitting duck in Dallas – Opinion Section The Atlantic  December 2002  The Medical Ordeals of JFK  Dallek He has also treated other celebrities, including Arthur Godfrey and Katharine Hepburn. Kraus maintained a multi-tiered, elastic billing system; for climbers and people he knew personally, or anyone who he thought would have trouble paying, he charged nothing; he charged partial payment for middle class patients, and regular rates for wealthy patients and celebrities.  Climbing  As a young man Kraus fell in love with the mountains, spending as much time as possible hiking and climbing. In his teenage years, Hans learned to climb in the Dolomites. Among his friends and climbing partners were Emilio Comici and Gino Soldà. He would later bring the Dolomite techniques of high-angle face climbing to the United States In 1940 he met Fritz Wiessner, who would become a lifelong friend and climbing partner. Wiessner had discovered the Shawangunks in 1935, and together Kraus and Wiessner spent every spare day developing routes in the area. Wiessner was known for his outstanding free climbing technique; Kraus's specialty was aid climbing. Thus, the two men's climbing skills complemented each other. While both men enjoyed climbing with women (notably with Bonnie Prudden, an accomplished climber in her own right), they continued to climb together, with often spectacular results. One of Kraus's and Wiessner's most significant efforts at the Gunks was High Exposure, a bold 5.6 that involves a blind reach around an overhung corner 150 feet up in the air; the route still confounds novice climbers. Done in 1941, with a hemp rope and three soft-iron pitons for protection, High Exposure was a world-class accomplishment. In November 1975, Kraus reclimbed the route – his favorite – to celebrate his 70th birthday. Other significant Kraus's first ascents in the Gunks included: Northern Pillar 5.2 (The first technical rock climb in The Trapps; Three Pines 5.3; Horseman 5.5; Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst 5.6; Easy Overhang 5.2; Bitchy Virgin 5.7R (the first \\"R\\" rated climb in the Shawangunks); and Emilio 5.7 (the first aid climb in the Gunks – Kraus and Wiessner employed a shoulder stand). By the end of the 1940s, the Shawangunks had fifty-eight documented climbing routes. Twenty-six of these were first ascents by Kraus; 23 were by Wiessner.  Personal life  Kraus was born in current day Trieste, Italy, which at the time was part of the 1867–1918 Austro-Hungarian Empire and was taught English as a youth by James Joyce. In 1938 the Kraus family fled Europe, just ahead of World War II, this time to the United States. They settled in New York City. Kraus was not allowed to enlist in the U.S. military because he had been born in Trieste, which had belonged to the Habsburg Empire at the time of Kraus's birth. Therefore, he was technically considered an \\"enemy alien\\", even though he was a legal immigrant, and a Jew. He became a U.S. citizen in 1945. Sometime in the late 1930s (precise date unknown; pre-1938), Kraus married Susanne Simon. The marriage was apparently not a happy one, and they separated in 1944 and were divorced in the 1950s. In 1951, Kraus made the acquaintance of Jim McCarthy, a young Princeton University undergraduate and up and coming climber. The two soon became fast friends and climbing partners, and McCarthy would go on to be Kraus's personal lawyer. In 1959, Kraus married Madi Springer-Miller, a champion skier and the first woman to ski the \\"Lip\\" of Tuckerman's Ravine on Mount Washington. They had two daughters, Ann and Mary. In 1984 at the age of 79, Kraus stopped climbing completely, due to arthritis, and the cumulative effects of various injuries. His last climb was Easy Overhang, a route he had done the first ascent of in 1941. In 1995 Kraus was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He died peacefully on the morning of March 6, 1996, in his New York City apartment, holding his daughter's hand. His ashes were carried up the High Exposure buttress by an old friend and scattered into the air at the top.

It is a main stop on the Manchester- Southport Line. It is run by Northern Trains. A bus interchange has recently been constructed next to the station, including a shop and cafe (both now closed). The station has been identified by Merseytravel as a possible interchange between the Liverpool to Ormskirk line and the Southport to Wigan line in its Liverpool City Region Long Term Rail Strategy.  History  The station was built by the Manchester and Southport Railway and opened on 9 April 1855, and from January 1885 was part of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (L&YR;). The main stone-built station building (no longer in use) was built during this time, in the standard L&YR; style. The L&YR; amalgamated with the London and North Western Railway on 1 January 1922 and in turn was grouped into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) in 1923. Nationalisation followed in 1948. When Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Rail. Until 1962, when this passenger service was withdrawn, trains from Southport to Burscough Bridge could continue to Burscough Junction and onto Ormskirk by means of one of the two curves that linked Wigan to Southport route with the ex-East Lancashire Railway main line between and . Both connections have since been lifted, but the formations remain and there have been calls from various parties to reopen them to allow through running from Southport to both Ormskirk and Preston.https://www.lancs.live/news/lancashire- news/southport-preston-west-lancs-mps-18001679 The main buildings on the Wigan-bound platform still stand, but are now in private residential use.  Interchange  This station is not to be confused with Burscough Junction, which is also in Burscough, but on the Ormskirk - Preston line. A bus interchange has been constructed next to the station to transport passengers between Burscough Bridge and Burscough Junction, including a shop and cafe. A ticket office was built within the complex; this opened in 2005, but was closed on 25 June 2016 due to council budget cuts. A public notice from Lancashire County Council informs passages that the nearest staffed station is either Ormskirk or Parbold.\\"Burscough Bridge ticket office closes\\" McCoid-Sou, Sophie Southport Visiter news article 28-06-2016; Retrieved 19 December 2016 There is step-free access to both platforms.Burscough Bridge station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 19 December 2016  Burscough Curves  During the rail restructuring of the 1960s and 1970s, the \\"Burscough Curves\\", which formed a link between the Ormskirk-Preston and Southport-Wigan lines were removed, although the formation survives. The North Curve was taken out of use and severed in July 1969, being lifted in 1973: it was last used for a Saturdays only empty train from Blackpool to Southport.British Railways London Midland Region Working Timetable May 1969-May 1970. The South Curve was singled in 1970, but remained in use to serve the extensive sidings at the MOD depot located just to the north of Burscough Junction station. It saw its last train in 1982. The passenger service from Ormskirk to Burscough Junction and on to Southport, which used the southern curve, was withdrawn in 1962 as can be seen from the British Rail London Midland Region Timetable of that year. Pressure from local transport groups, West Lancashire Borough Council and former Southport MP John Pugh has not so far persuaded Network Rail to reinstate the curves. Various schemes have been proposed, including the full electrification of the line from Southport via Burscough to Ormskirk using the same third rail system as Merseyrail. This proposal would allow users of the Ormskirk branch of Merseyrail's Northern Line to reach Southport without having to travel via Sandhills. In June 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies, in its Connecting Communities: Expanding Access to the Rail Network report, called for funding for the reopening of this line as part of a £500m scheme to open 33 stations on 14 lines closed in the Beeching Axe, including seven new parkway stations. The uses of the curves in a new service pattern has been identified by Network Rail, if electrified along with the through lines. Additionally, Network Rail has identified electrification of Wigan to Southport, together with the Ormskirk to Preston Line and the Burscough Curves as a possible source of new services. =Battery trains as enabler to open the curves= The New Merseyrail Fleet A Platform For Future Innovations document, mentions regarding Ormskirk-Preston enhancements, that there is the potential to use battery powered Merseyrail units that may improve the business case for opening the curves. The document states there will be a review after the Merseyrail units have been tested for battery operation in 2020.https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021632/http://moderngov.merseytravel.uk.net/documents/s21686/Enc.%201%20for%20Updated%20Long%20term%20Rail%20Strategy.pdf =MP unification= In March 2020, the MPs for Southport, South Ribble, West Lancs and Preston (Damien Moore, Katherine Fletcher, Rosie Cooper and Sir Mark Hendrick) along with Lancashire County Council leader Geoff Driver united in a bid to pressure Network Rail and the Government to reinstate the curves.  Services  On Monday to Saturday daytimes, there are two trains an hour westbound to Southport and eastbound to Wigan. Since the May 2019 timetable change, eastbound trains now continue via to both Manchester stations. One runs to Manchester Victoria and and the other to via Manchester Piccadilly and . Only a small number of business peak and late evening trains run via - passengers otherwise must change trains at Wigan to reach stations on this route. On Sundays there is an hourly service to Southport and via Manchester Victoria.  Gallery  File:Burscough Bridge railway station, Wigan platform.JPGThe old station building on the Wigan platform.

He is sometimes styled Mormaer of Mar since mormaer was the Scottish equivalent of the English word earl. Because the identification and numbering of the ancient earls of Mar is debatable, Thomas is variously numbered the ninth, tenth, or thirteenth. of the ancient earls. He was a son of Domhnall II of Mar, who fell at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332. Life Since Thomas was still in his minority at the time of his father's death, King Edward III of England, with whom Scotland was battling in the Scottish Wars of Independence, placed Thomas in the care of his (Thomas's) step-father, William Carsewell. He was prevented from receiving the earldom by Richard Talbot, 2nd Baron Talbot, who claimed the title Lord of Mar in the right of his wife, Elizabeth de Comyn. In the tumultuous years that followed Dupplin Moor, Thomas's grandmother, Lady Christina Bruce, held the seat of the earls of Mar, Kildrummy Castle. When she died in 1357, the castle passed to Thomas along with her lands and lordship, which were called the Earldom of Garioch. In 1351, Thomas was one of the ambassadors sent to England to negotiate the ransom of Scotland's king, David II, who was prisoner there. When David was eventually released in 1357, Thomas was one of the seven lords “from whom three were to be selected as hostages” until the king's ransom was paid. As Earl of Mar (as he was styled in 1357), Thomas was made Great Chamberlain of Scotland in 1358. Thomas is said to have favored England's king, Edward III, inasmuch as the English king had granted him a pension of 600 merks per annum. In addition, the English king agreed to pay Thomas £600 sterling yearly if he lost his lands in Scotland. Thomas agreed to serve the English king by fighting in England's war with France in 1360. In 1362, he was sent as a Scottish ambassador to negotiate with England, and in 1369 he was one of the guarantees of a truce between the two nations. Earl Thomas was in both England and France frequently in his life, as John Mackintosh has laid out in his book Historic Earls and Earldoms of Scotland: > In March, 1359, he had a passport through England for himself and thirty > persons in his retinue, and three merchants; while in August, 1359, he had a > safe conduct for himself and one hundred horsemen in his train. The same > year, in October, he had a passport to France with twenty-four horsemen. In > November, 1362, he had a safe conduct to the shrine of St. Thomas a Becket > at Canterbury for himself and twelve horsemen. He had passports for himself > and twelve horsemen in February, 1363, in March the same year, and in > February, 1365. In July, 1365, he had a licence to send eight horsemen to > Newcastle-on-Tyne with one hundred and twenty oxen, which he had sold to > merchants in that city. In October, 1368, he had a passport for himself and > twelve gentlemen on their way through England in pilgrimage to St. [John of] > Amiens, in France. In 1363, he fell out of favor with David II, perhaps due to David's resentment of Thomas's alliance with the English or perhaps because of the extortions Thomas was alleged to have committed on his people. For whatever reason, David besieged and took his Castle of Kildrummy. However, in 1368, upon payment of a composition, Thomas received it back and was restored to the king's good favor. Marriages Thomas married twice. His first wife was Margaret Graham of Menteith, whom he divorced because she bore him no children, or, as one old chronicler put it, “at the instigation of the Devil.” His second wife was Margaret Stewart, Countess of Angus, but this marriage produced no children either. Death and Burial Thomas died childless, some say in 1374, others in 1377, the confusion arising from the fact that his brother-in-law was already claiming the title Earl of Mar in 1374. However, some scholars argue that Earl Thomas must have died in early 1377 because of a charter dated August 10th of that year, in which Douglas confirmed a charter previously made by Thomas. Thomas of Mar was the last of the Celtic earls of Mar, and was buried within the walls of Kildrummy Castle. He was succeeded by his sister Margaret, through whom the title Earl of Mar did indeed pass to her husband, William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas.

Concept Regifting differs from straightforward giving in that goods are not acquired specifically for donation. Typically, goods that have been received as a gift are offered to others, unbeknown to them that it was originally a gift to the person offering it. Often the motives are principally charitable but also includes giving items which are surplus to one's needs. However, re-gifting also refers to the act of giving away unwanted gifts as a way of disposing them. Regiving differs from recycling in that recycling is most often associated with breaking components down and rebuilding into new products. Wednesday, July 22, 2020 Origin of the term  The term was popularized by an episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld (\\"The Label Maker\\"), although the practice pre-dates the term considerably.\\"Word of the Week\\" , by Kerry Maxwell, Macmillan English Dictionary. Retrieved April 17, 2007. In the episode, the character Elaine calls Dr. Tim Whatley a \\"regifter\\" after he gives Jerry Seinfeld a label-maker that was originally given to Whatley by Elaine. Another variant introduced in Seinfeld is degifting (see Indian giver), which refers to the act of demanding a gift back from the receiver. Etiquette Several rules of etiquette are proposed in popular media regarding regifting; they include rewrapping the gift, not using the gift before regifting it, and not giving the gift back to the original gift- giver.12 rules for 'regifting' without fear , by MP Dunleavey, MSN Money. Retrieved April 17, 2007 Regifting has become a popular addition to many white elephant gift exchanges or yankee swap events. There are no rules that specifically prohibit or encourage the practice of regifting at these parties, but generally the host of the party suggests regifting if it is an option. However, if the host suggests a spending limit for the party, it is generally poor etiquette to regift in lieu of making a purchase. The online variations of these exchanges eliminate this situation through their online purchasing requirements. One example of a formalization of this activity are the white elephant gift exchanges, in which items can be regifted from year to year. A variant of regifting was mentioned as one of Oprah's Favorite Things during the recession-themed 2008 episode. A Fairleigh Dickinson University PublicMind Poll in Dec. 2010 showed that regifting was \\"commonplace.\\"Leslie Kwoh, \\"Four in 10 New Jerseyans have regifted presents, poll finds,\\" Star-Ledger, Dec. 21, 2010, p. C1. Burçak Ertimur, one of the investigators in the study, and a professor of marketing at FDU, said “The popularity of regifting is driven by many things for different people. For some, it’s thrift in difficult economic times, or it’s a way to get around annoyingly high expectations about gift- giving. It’s also awareness of, or guilt over, how much stuff goes into the landfill. But the main reason might be just the sheer volume of stuff we have,” she said.Tom Hester, Sr., \\"Regifting’s popularity driven by many factors,\\" New Jersey Newsroom. Dec. 20, 2010 accessed at http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/style/regiftings-popularity-driven-by-many- factors Regifting has recently become more acceptable when it was adopted by environmentally and budgetary conscious people that encourage the Green Gifting concept. Commercial and other uses of the term In the USA, National Regifting Day is December 18, created by a debt-counselling group called Money Management International. Many office holiday parties are held on this day, and research shows that 40% of office party gifts are regifted without use. On October 24, 2008, the Governor of Colorado, Bill Ritter, Jr., declared December 18, 2008, \\"National Regifting Day\\".

However, the earliest version of the work was written around 1300, about 10 years before Tirel's birth. The original author is unknown, but it was common for medieval recipe collections to be plagiarized, complemented with additional material and presented as the work of later authors. Le Viandier is one of the earliest and best-known recipe collections of the Middle Ages, along with the Latin Liber de Coquina (early 14th century) and the English Forme of Cury (c. 1390). Among other things, it contains the first detailed description of an entremet.  Manuscripts  There are four extant manuscripts of Le Viandier.; Scully 1988 is the first edition to collate all four extant manuscripts; an English translation of the 220 recipes is included. The oldest, found in the Archives cantonales du Valais (Sion, Switzerland), was written in the late 13th or very early 14th century, and was largely overlooked until the 1950s. It is this manuscript that calls into question the authorship of Tirel, but a portion of it is missing at the beginning, so the title and author given for this earlier work are unknown. A manuscript from the 14th century housed in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Paris), was formerly thought to be the oldest. The version in the Biblioteca Vaticana (Vatican City), is from the early 15th century. The fourth extant version is in the Bibliothèque Mazarine (Paris) and also dates to the 15th century. There was a fifth version from the 15th century in Saint-Lô, in the Archives de la Manche. It was mentioned by Jérôme Pichon and Georges Vicaire in their 1892 monograph, Le Viandier; however, the Saint-Lô manuscript was destroyed by fire on 6 June 1944 during the invasion of Normandy. In the Valais manuscript there are about 130 recipes. There are variations from manuscript to manuscript, both in their original form and in what has been preserved or lost over the centuries.  Haute Cuisine  Le Viandier was one of the first \\"haute cuisine\\" cookbooks, offering a framework for its preparation and presentation at table. Taillevent was a master cook to Charles V, which gave him extensive experience in serving French nobility. Taillevent divided the book into various sections, including sections specific to the preparation of meats, entremets, fish, sauces, and other recipes. Taillevent also goes into detail on the spices that should be used for various dishes. According to Taillevent, there are three themes in haute cuisine; the use of spices, the separation of preparation for the meat and fish dishes from the sauces, and the way a dish should be presented. These were all carefully outlined in Le Viandier. To further this idea of \\"medieval haute cuisine\\", Taillevent also mentions how much emphasis was placed on presentation by noting that often dyes were used to color sauces and meat roasts were covered with gold and silver leaves. Print About 1486, Le Viandier went into print without a title-page date or place, but this was undoubtedly Paris. The 1486 version contained an additional 142 recipes not found in the manuscripts. Twenty-four editions were produced between 1486 and 1615.

Initially it consisted only of the Third Estate, with representatives of the three cities of Bruges, Ghent and Ypres. Around 1350 the rural Liberty of Bruges also obtained representation in the States. History In the Burgundian Netherlands, the States of Flanders were the first host of the States-General of the Netherlands, convened in Bruges on 9 January 1464. In 1579–1581, during the Eighty Years' War, the cities and the States of Flanders subscribed to the Union of Utrecht and the Act of Abjuration declaring independence from Habsburg rule, but royal troops reconquered most of the Flemish territory (excepting Zeelandic Flanders) and restored Habsburg rule. Under the government of the Archdukes Albert and Isabella a representation of the First Estate was included in the composition of the States of Flanders. From 1754 smaller towns in Flanders were granted representation in the States, and the responsibilities of the body were extended from voting taxes and levying troops to oversight of public works and public assets. On 4 January 1790, the States of Flanders declared independence from Austrian rule, and seven days later, on 11 January 1790, joined the United States of Belgium.

We're Being Shot At!) is a 1966 French-British comedy film set in 1942 about French civilians who help the crew of a Royal Air Force bomber shot down over Paris to make their way through German-occupied France to safe territory. For over forty years La Grande Vadrouille was the most successful French film in France, topping the box office with over 17,200,000 cinema admissions. It remains the fifth most successful film ever in France (on the basis of admissions), of any nationality, behind the 1997 version of Titanic, French hits Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis (2008) and Intouchables (2011), which were seen by over 19,000,000 cinemagoers and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.Data on :fr:Allociné\\"Les Ch'tis plus forts que La Grande vadrouille\\", Olivier Corriez, TF1  Plot  On a summer day in 1942 a damaged RAF bomber strays over Paris and is shot down by German flak. After planning to reconvene in the Turkish baths at the Grand Mosque of Paris, three crew members parachute out safely. Sir Reginald lands in Vincennes Zoo and, given civilian clothes by a friendly zoo keeper, heads for the baths. Peter Cunningham lands on the platform of a house painter, Augustin, from where he is clothed and hidden by a puppet show operator, Juliette, while Augustin goes to the baths on his behalf. Alan MacIntosh lands on the Opéra Garnier, where he is reluctantly clothed and hidden by the chief conductor, Stanislas, who goes to the baths for him. All this time, the German military under Major Achbach furiously pursue the three and their helpers. By nightfall the Resistance has arranged for the aviators, together with Augustin and Stanislas who are now wanted men, to be conducted by Juliette to a safe hotel at Meursault, from where they can cross the line of demarcation to the free zone, or “Vichy France.” After numerous misadventures the fugitives are rescued from German-occupied territory by a Resistance nun with a horse-drawn wagon. Pursued by half-track armored vehicles and a spotter plane, she wisks them to a shuttered gliding club, where all six launch two gliders and through machine-gun fire fly to safety.

It was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris with extensive location shooting around France. The film's sets were designed by the art director Jean André.  Reception  The film was the most popular of 1966 at the French box office (and the most popular and highest-grossing of all-time) with admissions of 17,275,169 and a gross of $32,994,000. (This was almost twice as much as the second most popular, Dr Zhivago, which had 9,816,305 admissions and a gross of $16,536,000.) The film features in the 2018 film Roma.

The Jíbaro is a self-subsistence farmer, and an iconic reflection of the Puerto Rican people. Traditional jíbaros were also farmer-salesmen who would grow enough crops to sell in the towns near their farms in order to purchase clothing, etc., for their families. In contemporary times, both white-collar and blue-collar Puerto Ricans are identifying themselves as jibaros in a proud connection with their Puerto Rican history and culture in general.  Historical context  As early as 1820, Miguel Cabrera identified many of the Jibaro's ideas and characteristics in his set of poems known as The Jíbaro’s Verses. Then, some 80 years later, in his 1898 book Cuba and Porto Rico, Robert Thomas Hill listed jíbaros as one of four socio-economic classes he perceived existed in Puerto Rico at the time: \\"The native people, as a whole, may be divided into four classes: the better class of Creoles, who call themselves Spaniards; the lower class of white peasantry, known as gibaros; the colored people, or mestizos; and the blacks.\\" Under Operation Bootstrap, in the middle of the twentieth century, Puerto Rico experienced an island-wide shift from an agrarian to a cosmopolitan society. Industries incorporated cheap labor, which led to the migration of many Jíbaros from the mountain towns to the larger urban areas. Jíbaros had a significant impact on the culture, political life, and language of Puerto Rico. Jíbaros were viewed differently by different Puerto Ricans. A jibaro on a horse In the political arena, when Luis Muñoz Marín ran for office, he often invoked the Jíbaro as a means of uniting the working class of Puerto Rico under a populist party. To his own political gain, he sought to represent them as possessing ideals of hard-working Puerto Ricans. Muñoz Marín also adopted as the symbol of his party the silhouette of a Puerto Rican farmer with a pava,LAS ELECCIONES DE 1964 EN PUERTO RICO: UNA EVALUACION. ROBERT W. ANDERSON. Revista de Ciencias Socisles. Vol IX. Num 3. September 1965. Universidad de Puerto Rico. p. 263. Accessed 2 August 2019. the straw hat that field laborers often wore. It served to bolster their image as that of a proud people who worked and toiled the land to earn an honest living. Simultaneously, Muñoz Marín developed as his party's motto the phrase \\"Pan, Tierra, Libertad\\" (Bread, Land, Liberty). Muñoz Marín himself, in an attempt to court the votes of the large segment of the electorate represented by the Jíbaro population, at times dressed like his portrayals of the Jíbaro. By idealizing the Jíbaro, Luis Muñoz Marín was also able to captivate the attention and goodwill of much of the cultural elite of Puerto Rico because many of them viewed Jíbaros as the \\"essence of the Puerto Rican soul\\". His campaign, in effect, portrayed the Jíbaro through a lens of whiteness, much like Manuel A. Alonso had done before. In 1941, Oscar Colón Delgado created Jíbaro Negro (black jíbaro) which represents a dark-skinned \\"jíbaro farmer\\". Andrés Jiménez, \\"el Jíbaro\\", a Puerto Rican troubadour, would work on changing that perception with his song describing \\"El Puertorriqueño\\" as having a dark skin tone. Social, family and work aspects The jíbaro values and way of life are oftentimes associated with the rich heritage and positive culture of Puerto Rico, as well as with the authenticity, resourcefulness and craftsmanship of the Puerto Rican people. These values and way of life include a sense of community, family, and hospitality. From young, children were taught to contribute to the family by, for example, assisting with cleaning and cooking family meals, and for older children, by ironing their own school clothes and polishing their own shoes. Some children were encouraged to look for ways to make money in order to buy anything that was not deemed a “need”.Unapologetically Jibaro. Mariela Oyola-Brauch. Culebra Ventures. 2017.

Mari Mut tells us that the traditional clothing of jíbaro men consisted of a long-sleeved white shirt and white pants, a fringe-less hat, and no shoes. According to him, the jíbaro woman (\\"jíbara\\") would also usually dress in white with a long shirt, shoulders and neck often covered, and would sometimes wear a hat or a bandana as a hair cover. She, too, would wear no shoes. The custom of not wearing shoes was not associated with poverty. Many instances of jíbaros were documented by American photographer Walter B. Townsend—both in writing and via his photographs—who were adequately dressed but wearing no shoes. The custom is thus attributed to comfort and convenience. Young jíbaro toddler boys would oftentimes be seen at their home naked, even while the jíbaro family hosted visitors. But the notion that this custom was also true for girls, or that jíbaro boys went to school naked, was debunked by over 3,000 pictures that Townsend took throughout Puerto Rico in 1900.El Libro y La Gente. Las fotos de Puerto Rico en 'Our Islands and Their People'. Jose A. Mari Mut. 2013. Vol I, pages 4-5. (Digital version page 4.) Entertainment A Cockfighting club in Puerto Rico in 1937. A jíbaro's almost exclusive form of entertainment was cock-fighting. The pastime was performed mostly on Sunday afternoons, but saint days, feast days, or any other festive holidays would bring out particularly huge crowds to the event. Every town in Puerto Rico would have at least one cock-fighting pit. The upper classes of society would sometimes come to one of these events, but would not ordinarily be participants. Unlike the birds in the United States which were outfitted with metal razor-sharp blades strapped to their legs, Puerto Rico jíbaros fought their cocks with their own gaffs.William Dinwiddie. Cock-fighting in Puerto Rico. Harper's Weekly. Vol 52, No. 2189, p. 1174. 3 December 1898. Occupations Many jíbaros were self-subsistence farmers, but there were also those who owned no land but instead worked as agricultural land tenants, sharecroppers, and fieldworkers of various types.Man in a sugar-cane field during harvest, vicinity of Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico. Jack Delano. Library of Congress. Prints and Photographs Division. Washington, D.C. December 1941. Accessed 10 December 2018. Some of those that did own their own plot of land would were also farmer-salesmen who would grow enough crops to sell in the towns near their farms in order to purchase clothing, etc.. Their crops would consist of whatever the land would grow: bananas, plantains, avocados, ñames, yautías, batatas, yucas, malangas, apio, etc. However, chickens, hens, eggs, and even charcoal were also traded.Odilio Jimenez. Un Jíbaro en San Juan. Accessed 10 December 2018. Political participation  The Jibaro population was also the main component of many of the struggles against the ruling colonial powers in the Island. They were the primary driving force in revolutions in Puerto Rico against the Spaniards, including the well-known 1868 Grito de Lares (Cry of Lares). Even after that revolution failed, the Jíbaro were credited with keeping the spirit of Puerto Rican freedom alive through other revolts including the 1897 Intentona de Yauco. After the Americans became the new colonial power in Puerto Rico in 1898, many Jíbaros organized Bandas Sediciosas (Seditious Bands) to protest American colonial rule. Jíbaros continued their struggle against American rule in Puerto Rico via the 1930s armed clashes of members of the Nationalist Party of Puerto Rico against the repressive police forces of the colonial regime and via the Nationalist Party's revolts of 1950.

A jíbaro can mean someone who is considered ignorant or impressionable due to a lack of a more formal form of education, as are many country or \\"hillbilly\\" people of several other countries. Despite this negative connotation, the primary image is now that of the a person representing the idea of a \\"traditional Puerto Rican\\": simple but hard- working, independent but prudently wise.

Another name for them is subchondral cortico-spongious progenitors. They have euchromatic nuclei and stain by basic dyes. These cells are extremely important in chondrogenesis due to their role in forming both the chondrocytes and cartilage matrix which will eventually form cartilage. Use of the term is technically inaccurate since mesenchymal progenitors can also technically differentiate into osteoblasts or fat. Chondroblasts are called chondrocytes when they embed themselves in the cartilage matrix, consisting of proteoglycan and collagen fibers, until they lie in the matrix lacunae. Once they embed themselves into the cartilage matrix, they grow the cartilage matrix by growing more cartilage extracellular matrix rather than by dividing further. Structure Within adults and developing adults, most chondroblasts are located in the perichondrium. This is a thin layer of connective tissue which protects cartilage and is where chondroblasts help to expand cartilage size whenever prompted to by hormones such as GH, TH, and glycosaminoglycans. They are located on the perichondrium because the perichondrium, located on the outside of developing bone, is not as heavily ensheathed in cartilage extracellular matrix as the interior and because here where capillaries are located. The type of growth maintained by chondroblasts is called appositional bone growth and increases the birth of the affected tissue. It is important to note that perichondrium, and thus chondroblasts, are not found on the articular cartilage surfaces of joints. =Matrix formation and composition= The extracellular matrix secreted by chondroblasts is composed of fibers, collagen, hyaluronic acid, proteoglycans, glycoproteins, water, and a host of macromolecules. Within finished cartilage, collagen fibers compose 10-20% of the volume, water 65-80%, and the proteoglycan-hyaluronic acid aggregates the remaining portion. Due to the proliferative nature of Chondroblasts, cells compose a larger portion of the composition than what is normally found within completed cartilage. Collagen Type II fibers are responsible for giving the future cartilage matrix its tensile strength. The structure of these fibers, like the majority of collagen fibers, forms a triple helix structure. Proteoglycans resist the compression generally put upon cartilage and generate the swelling pressure responsible for stress shielding the matrix from compression loading. They attach themselves to up to 100 Chondroitin sulfate molecules and up to 50 keratan sulfate glycoaminoglycan chains. These chains together are attached to a hyaluronic acid backbone which, in conjunction with the collagen fibrils, create an interstitial intrafibrillar space in which water is held in by the negative charge of the proteoglycans. Development As suggested in the name, mesenchymal progenitors originate from the mesoderm. These cells, when forming from the mesoderm, specifically form from embryonic stem cells via induction through BMP4 and fibroblast growth factor FGF2 while the fetus is inside the womb. It has been suggested that differentiating embryonic stem cells with these growth factors could prevent stem cells, once injected into potential patients, from forming teratomas, or stem cell caused tumors. =Signaling, transcription and environmental factors responsible for chondroblast creation= Transcription factors An important genetic component of this process is Sox9, a HMG box transcription factor, which marks progenitor cells for chondrogenic differentiation. Inactivation of the Sox9 gene will result in the loss of all Cartilage, and thus Chondroblast, formation. This factor is also expressed alongside Sox5 and Sox6. Runx2 is another important genetic component of Chondroblast formation. It has been found that expressing this gene will result in the suppression of the differentiation of chondroblasts. Expression of this gene will also prompt already formed cartilage to undergo endochondral ossification which will prompt the cartilage to form bone. It is important to note here that these genes are not the only factors which determine whether chondroblasts will form. General inactivation or activation of these gene doesn't turn all affected cells into one type or another. Extrinsic environmental factors act upstream in determining what cell type will form out of any particular mesenchymal progenitor cell.  Wnt/β-catenin signaling  Wnt14 is controlled by Col2a1 and is put through the β-Catenin mediated Wnt pathway. Higher levels of Wnt14 prevented chondrocyte differentiation whereas lower levels appeared to allow it. If the Wnt/ β-Catenin pathway is upregulated, then endochondral ossification is encouraged which promotes ossification of the formed cartilage. This pathway is a canonical Wnt pathway because of the β-Catenin that accumulates once Wnt14 signalling is initiated. After Wnt14 is initiated, phosphorylation of the β-Catenin that would normally mark the protein for destruction is suppressed which allows it to accumulate and eventually go into the cell nucleus to bind to the LEF/TCF transcription factors which lead both to the destruction of any remaining phosphorylated β-Catenin as well as the differentiation of mesenchymal progenitor cells into osteoblasts. Testing of this pathway has indicated that the Wnt/β-Catenin increases β-Catenin levels before the activation of the Runx2 and Osx transcription factors which seems to suggest that early β-Catenin levels can be a sign of whether an early mesenchymal progenitor cell will progress to a chondrocyte or to an osteoblast. Retinoic acid Retinoic acid, part of a family of molecules called retinoids, need to be repressed in order for Chondroblasts to form. A 2003 study using transgenic mice with a weak, constitutively active retinoic acid receptor found that retinoids maintain cells within condensations in a prechondrogenic, mesenchymal cell state which prevents cell differentiation. It has also been suggested that the inhibition of receptor mediated retinoid signaling induces Sox9 expression which is considered a “master switch” for the differentiation of chondroblasts. Environmental factors Differentiation of chondroblasts is favored in an environment with high compressive force and low partial oxygen pressure which combine to inhibit protein 3, a protein which inhibits cartilage differentiation. These preferences are important since mature cartilage tissue is avascular and thus would be ill-suited to a high oxygen environment. Function Chondroblasts appear to migrate to cartilage whenever chondrocytes are destroyed via mechanical force. Remaining chondrocytes divide in order to form more chondroblasts. HMGB-1, a growth factor which promotes chondrocyte division while receptors for advanced glycation products (RAGE) mediated chemotaxis to clean up cell debris resulting from the damage. Chondroblasts then secrete cartilage matrix around themselves in order to reform the lost cartilage tissue. However, regeneration is still too slow for patient care to effectively rely on this mechanism of repair. Part of this inability to regenerate quickly from injury results from the relative avascular nature of cartilage as compared to other connective tissues of the human body. Pathology Chondroblastomas can sometimes form, which are benign tumors that form at the sites of endochondral ossification due to over stimulation of the chondroblasts. When they form, they are usually found on the upper or lower tibia as well as the upper humerus where chondroblast activity is most apparent. Rarely, they can be found on the feet, hands, flat bones, or spine. 30–50% of these sarcomas have an accompanying osteoblastoma which is similarly benign. Chondrosarcoma is a more malignant type of tumor, but most are low grade tumors and often appear in the axial skeletal region. It constitutes 20% of skeletal system tumors in the United States.

The term F-value or \\"FTref/z\\" is defined as the equivalent number of minutes to a certain reference temperature (Tref) for a certain control microorganism with an established Z-value.Stumbo C.R., Thermobacteriology in Food Processing, 1973. , 9780080886473 Z-value is a term used in microbial thermal death time calculations. It is the number of degrees the temperature has to be increased to achieve a tenfold (i.e. 1 log10) reduction in the D-value. The D-value of an organism is the time required in a given medium, at a given temperature, for a ten-fold reduction in the number of organisms. It is useful when examining the effectiveness of thermal inactivations under different conditions, for example in food cooking and preservation. The z-value is a measure of the change of the D-value with varying temperature, and is a simplified version of an Arrhenius equation and it is equivalent to z=2.303 RT Tref/E.Holdsworth S.D, Aseptic Processing and Packaging of Food Products, 1992. , 9781851667758 The z-value of an organism in a particular medium is the temperature change required for the D-value to change by a factor of ten, or put another way, the temperature required for the thermal destruction curve to move one log cycle. It is the reciprocal of the slope resulting from the plot of the logarithm of the D-value versus the temperature at which the D-value was obtained. While the D-value gives the time needed at a certain temperature to kill 90% of the organisms, the z-value relates the resistance of an organism to differing temperatures. The z-value allows calculation of the equivalency of two thermal processes, if the D-value and the z-value are known. Example: if it takes an increase of 10 °C (18 °F) to move the curve one log, then our z-value is 10. Given a D-value of 4.5 minutes at 150 °C, the D-value can be calculated for 160 °C by reducing the time by 1 log. The new D-value for 160 °C given the z-value is 0.45 minutes. This means that each 10°C (18 °F) increase in temperature will reduce our D-value by 1 log. Conversely, a 10 °C (18 °F) decrease in temperature will increase our D-value by 1 log. So, the D-value for a temperature of 140 °C would be 45 minutes.

The system was first proposed in 1982 by the economist Robert Hall. ANCAP is an example of a commodity standard. Background of a commodity standard In order to understand the uniqueness behind the ANCAP proposal, one must understand the history of the monetary system in the United States, which currently operates under a fiat currency standard. In such a standard, the value of currency is set by the federal government. Not long ago, America’s monetary system was built on a commodity standard, where the value of currency depended on a fixed exchange rate between money and a single good or a basket of goods. For a significant portion of American history, the value of the dollar was linked to gold. The price of an ounce of gold was set at a specific dollar amount, and the remaining goods in the economy were set relative to the value of gold. Problems of a commodity standard Economists have noted various problems and benefits associated with a commodity standard. A potential problem arises when the price of the anchor good (or goods) regularly fluctuates. Since the prices of all other goods in the economy are determined by the price of the anchor good(s), they adjust to price fluctuations of the anchor good. Take for example an economy operating under a commodity standard where gasoline is the anchor good. Gas station signs show that the price of gasoline fluctuates on a daily basis. In such a scenario, the prices of every other good are adjusted on a daily basis. Facing daily changes in prices would be a nuisance for consumers, whose natural desire is to see stable prices. A way to avoid this problem is to select an anchor good whose price does not fluctuate, or to choose a basket of goods whose price remains stable over long periods of time. It is questionable whether an economy under a commodity standard would indeed have less inflation than under a fiat currency system. The reason for this is that the commodity content of a fiat currency can be redefined by the government at any time. That is, the government would have the power to create inflation simply by raising the dollar price of the commodity base(s). Such an act would have the same effect as increasing the amount of dollars in the monetary base. Details of ANCAP In 1982, the University of Chicago Press published Robert Hall's idea of ANCAP as an alternative to the gold standard. Explorations in the Gold Standard and Related Policies for Stabilizing the Dollar ANCAP is based on a weighted average of four commodities-- ammonium nitrate, copper, aluminum and plywood (or ANCAP as an abbreviation). Hall chose the four commodities (which he calls \\"resource units\\") from a list also containing wheat, sugar, heating oil, soybean oil, tin, zinc, nylon, cotton, latex, and mercury. One unit of ANCAP would consist of 33 cents' worth of ammonium nitrate, 12 cents' worth of copper, 36 cents' worth of aluminum, and 19 cents' worth of plywood (all prices are in 1967 values). In his proposal, Hall states his position against the idea of a government holding reserves under any type of a commodity standard. He argues that by allowing the government to manipulate the market, the anti-inflationary purpose of the commodity standard would be invalidated. This statement by Hall allows for a wider variation in commodities to be used as the bundle. For example, if the government wanted to hold reserves of a certain commodity, it would certainly not choose plywood because of the size (compared to gold, which has relatively concentrated wealth) and potential deterioration. Hall argues that any commodity can serve as the base as long as it is (1) sufficiently homogenous and (2) easily measured. However, he claimed that ANCAP was a particularly good choice because the index followed the Consumer Price Index very well from the postwar era up until the year he published the idea, 1982. Hall claims that one possible goal of a commodity standard is to stabilize the cost of living (trying to stabilize all prices is likely unrealistic). To do this, commodities whose value changes in accordance with changes in the cost of living should be chosen as the base.

The formal name to refer to this particular population is ', short for the very formal ', but this self-appellation technically includes all inhabitants of the New Caledonian archipelago, not just the Caldoche. Another \\"white\\" demographic element (although they may well be French people of different ethnic backgrounds) in the territory is expatriates from metropolitan France who live there temporarily as civil servants. Caldoches emphasise their own position as permanent locals by referring to the temporary expatriates as ' (short for ') or as Zoreilles (informally ') in local slang. New Caledonia was used as a penal colony from 1854 to 1922 by France. From this period and on, many Europeans (particularly of French and, to some extent, German origin) settled in the territory and they intermingled with Asian and Polynesian settlers. Code de l'indigénat, introduced in 1887, provided the free settler population with an advantageous status over the indigenous Melanesian peoples, known collectively as Kanak. Caldoches settled and gained property on the dry west coast of the main island Grande Terre where the capital Nouméa is also located, pushing the Kanaks onto small reservations in the north and east. With the superior position, they constituted the ruling class of the colony and they were the ones who widened the usage of the word Canaque as a pejorative. Caldoches tend to be political loyalists (in the context of New Caledonia, they oppose independence from France). They were seen as supporters of the strongly Caldoche Rally for Caledonia in the Republic (Rally for Caledonia inside the Republic) until 2004, when their support shifted considerably towards Avenir ensemble (\\"Future Together\\"), which has the vision of a multiracial New Caledonia within the framework of the French Republic. Etymology There are many theories on the origin of the term \\"Caldoche\\". The most widespread story, as told by the collective lexicon 1001 Caledonian Words, attributes the term to local journalist and polemicist Jacqueline Schmidt, who participated actively towards the end of the 1960s in the debate concerning the Billotte laws (in particular the first law, which transferred mining responsibilities in New Caledonia to the state), and signed her articles with the pseudonym \\"Caldoche\\", a portmanteau of the prefix \\"Cald-\\", referring to her strong feeling of belonging to New Caledonia, where her family settled almost 100 years earlier, and the suffix \\"-oche\\", referring to the pejorative term \\"dirty Boche\\", having been called that by some of her schoolfriends' parents due to her German heritage (the Schmidts form part of an important German community from the Rhineland, having fled Germany to escape Prussian domination in the 1860sP. O'REILLY, Calédoniens : Répertoire bio-bibliographique de la Nouvelle-Calédonie, éd. Société des Océanistes, n°3, Paris, 1953, p.235-236). The owner of the newspaper D1TO, Gerald Rousseau, found the name amusing, and popularised it.Article « Caldoche », Dico de la Brousse en Folie Origins of the Caldoche people =Free colonists= Many colonists either came to New Caledonia through personal initiative or were supported by government programmes and policies to populate New Caledonia. Examples of different waves of settlement include the following: * 'Paddon' colonists, named after the English merchant James Paddon. In exchange for selling his own land on Île Nou to the French state in 1857 to become part of the infrastructure of the penal colony there, he was given 4000 hectares of farmland in the Karikouié and Katiramona river basins in Païta, on condition that they be populated with at least 22 'males of the white race' together with their families. In the end he received 18 families, including some of Paddon's own nephews who inherited the land after Paddon's death, with the first 5 families, mostly of German origin, arriving in 1859. These settlers mostly cultivated vegetables, with sugarcane cultivation having been abandoned early on. However, difficult conditions forced many of the settlers to move either to the capital or to Australia.Présentation des colons Paddon, Ibid.S. FORMIS, « La Saga Martin », Sagas calédoniennes : 50 grandes familles, Tome II, éd. Dimanche Matin, Nouméa, 2000, p.130-133 * 'Cheval' colonists, named after the Norman restorator Timothée Cheval, who sought his fortune in New Caledonia in the 1860s and received 1800 hectares by a decree from the governor, on condition that he bring 6 to 8 European settlers, 100 horned livestock, 16 mares and one stallion. These settlers arrived on La Gazelle from Australia in 1862, followed by Cheval's own brother Hippolyte in 1866. As with the Paddon colonists, many subsequently resettled in Nouméa or outside New Caledonia.P. O'REILLY, Calédoniens, 1853 * Bourbonnais colonists, made up of Reunionese Creoles who settled in New Caledonia between 1864 and 1880 when the Mascarene Islands entered a period of economic crisis linked with droughts and diseases that attacked the islands' sugar cane crops. Many of these families brought Malbar and Cafre indentured labourers with them and settled on 10,000 hectares of land, used for sugar cane plantation, scattered around the island particularly in Nakety, Canala and Houaïlou on the East coast and Dumbéa, La Foa, La Ouaménie and Koné on the West coast.L'Usine sucrière de La Ouaménie sur le site de la Province Sud These plantations were initially a success, and by 1875 at least 454 Reunionese people had arrived to the island. However, locust invasions and the Kanak revolt of 1878 put an end to sugar cane cultivation on the island, and so many of the Reunionese settlers either emigrated back to Réunion or to Metropolitan France or found other careers in the government administration. By 1884 only 173 Reunionese settlers remained.Populations, ASTER du Caillou, d'après les chiffres avancés par J.C. ROUX dans le bulletin de la SEHNC n° 11, année 1976 As well as these planned colonisation projects, many other settlers arrived through their own initiative, for various reasons including poverty at home (such as in the case of Irish and Italian settlers, as well as peasants from mountainous areas of France which were hit hard by the rural crisis of the 19th century), the possibility of acquiring wealth, politics (e.g. republican militants who fled Metropolitan France during the 1851 Coup, or people from Germany and Alsace who refused to live under Prussian rule), or simply overstaying their posts in the civil service or the military. =Penal colonists= The first 250 prisoners arrived in Port-de-France on board the ship L'Iphigénie. Alain Saussol estimates that 75 different convoys brought around 21,630 prisoners to the penal colony between 1864 and 1897. By 1877, there were 11,110 penal colonists present in New Caledonia, making up around two-thirds of the European population at the time. The last prison colonies were closed in 1922 and 1931. The prisoner population could be divided into roughly three groups. The 'transported' were convicts sentenced under common law, ranging from eight years up to life, for crimes ranging from physical and sexual assault to murder. These were mostly taken to the prison at Île Nou and worked on the construction of roads and buildings in the colony. Political prisoners, or the 'deported', made up the second group. Many of these participated in the Paris Commune of 1871, 4250 of whom were sent either to Île des Pins or Ducos, including Louise Michel and Henri Rochefort. After they were all granted amnesty in 1880, less than 40 families decided to stay in New Caledonia. Another group of 'deportees' were participants in the Mokrani Revolt of 1871-72 in Algeria, the majority of whom decided to stay in New Caledonia following the granting of amnesty in 1895 and from whom the majority of Algerian New Caledonians in Bourail are descended. Recidivists, or the 'relegated', made up the third group, 3757 of whom were sent from 1885 onwards to New Caledonia, particularly to Île des Pins, Prony or Boulouparis. The 'transported' and 'relegated' stopped being brought to New Caledonia in 1897. Following being condemned to forced labour, the prisoners had to atone for their crimes by working on penitentiary farms, and once freed were given a portion of the land. Overall around 1300 pieces of land, totalling around 260,000 hectares largely taken from the indigenous Kanak people, were awarded to freed prisoners, particularly around Bourail, La Foa-Farino, Ouégoa and Pouembout, where many of the descendants of the prisoner population remain to this day. =Geographical origins= The vast majority of Caldoche people are of French origin. Notable French immigration waves include those who fled Alsace and Lorraine following the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Creole people from Réunion who fled during the sugar crisis of the 1860s and 1870s, merchants and ship owners from Bordeaux and Nantes drawn to the island at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries by economic opportunities related to the discovery of nickel reserves, and colonists from the Nord and Picardy regions. Other French people who settled the island included sailors and adventurers from Normandy and Brittany, as well as settlers from the poorest regions of France in what is now the Empty diagonal. However, as previously mentioned, there were also a large number of Paddon and Cheval colonists of British and Irish origin (many of the latter having fled Ireland during the Great Famine) who came to the island via Australia, as well as a sizeable number of Italians, Germans (particularly from the Rhineland), Belgians, Swiss, Spaniards, Croatians and Poles. A significant number of non- Europeans are also grouped under the Caldoche people despite often being of mixed race origin, notably those from Indonesia, Vietnam, Japan, India (via Réunion) and Algeria (the latter particularly concentrated around Bourail) Geographical distribution There is usually a division among the Caldoche people between those in the capital Nouméa and those in the countryside or 'the Brush' (French: les Broussards). The former are among the most established in the island, arriving in waves of pioneer colonisation in the 1850s to 1870s before the establishment of the penal colony, many of whom having formerly lived in 'the Brush' before either having moved to the capital for economic reasons or witnessing their farms being swallowed up by the expanding urban area of Nouméa itself, and often these people still own rural properties outside of the city. The large number of White people in the capital has led to the city being commonly known as \\"Nouméa the White\\", with the combined self-declared European population comprising a plurality of 37.28% (61,034) of the population of Greater Nouméa and 43.4% of the population of Nouméa proper according to the 2009 census, despite more recent waves of immigration of workers from Wallis and Futuna as well as the rural exodus of the indigenous Kanak people from the Brush. Taking into account both the mixed-race metis population and people who put down an alternative ethnic designation on the census (e.g. 'Caledonian'), this proportion increases to 54.19% (88,728) of Greater Nouméa and 58.17% of Nouméa proper, although this figure could also include other populations such as immigrants from Asia or the French Caribbean. The term Broussard refers to people of European descent in the countryside who live a rural lifestyle, usually raising cattle but also cervids, poultry and rabbits. They are particularly concentrated on the West coast of the main island, from Païta in the South to Koumac in the North, with the proportion decreasing with increasing distance from the capital. Smaller communities also exist on the East coast, notably in Touho and Poindimié as well as in the mining villages of Kouaoua and Thio, where the proportion oscillates between about 7-20% of the population according to the 2009 census. By contrast, they are almost completely absent from the Loyalty Islands, which remains customary property of the indigenous population. It is difficult to gauge the total Caledonian population in New Caledonia today, since the most recent census in 2009 only distinguishes those of European descent (71,721 people, or 29.2% of the total population) from those of mixed origin or 'several communities' (20,398 people or 8.31%), Indonesians (5003 people, 2.5%), Vietnamese people (2822, 1.43%) and those who simply refer to themselves as 'Caledonian' (12,177 people, 4.96%), many of whom consider themselves Caldoche, while the census makes no distinction between people of European descent who consider themselves 'Caldoche' and more recent immigrants from Metropolitan France (the so-called 'Zoreilles').Recensement ISEE, 2009 .

The term describes both a bucket bong and a waterfall bong, since both use air pressure and water to draw smoke. A lung uses similar equipment but instead of water draws the smoke by removing a compacted plastic bag or similar from the chamber. The bucket bong is made out of two containers, with the larger, open top container filled with water. The smaller has an attached bowl and open bottom, and the smaller is placed into the larger. Once the bowl is lit, the operator must move the small container up, causing a pressure difference. Smoke slowly fills the small jar until the user removes the bowl and inhales the contents. A waterfall bong is made up of only one container. The container must have a bowl and a small hole near the base so the water can drain easily. As the water flows out of the container, air is forced through the bowl and causes the substance to burn and accumulate smoke in the bong. Description =Cup bong= The bottle's lid The bong, ready for operation The construction of a bucket bong (or simply a \\"bucket\\") calls for a plastic bottle (about ), a Hex Bit Socket used as the bowl, an aerator screen cut to fit the bowl, and a large bucket or other container into which both the bottle and a sufficient amount of water will properly go. The plastic bottle's base is cut off, and the bottle's cap has a small hole in the center which will eventually hold a bowl. The screen is placed inside of the bowl. The cut nozzle is threaded into the hole outside the cap. Diagram of bucket bong in operation The cap is then packed with a smokable substance and screwed onto the bottle once it is immersed to its neck in liquid. While lighting the bowl with (preferably) a lighter or match, the bottle is gradually lifted until it is about to come out of the water or when the substance ceases burning. While the bottle is held in place, the lid is removed, the user's mouth is placed on the bottle opening, and the user inhales as the bottle is pushed back down into the water. The cause of the smoke being expelled by the bottle's movement is the rise in internal pressure, created when the water volume increases; the smoke enters the lungs in a \\"smoother\\" manner than inhaling from a joint, blunt, or bowl by itself. This will give the smoker a sudden dose with hardly any smoke lost, rather than the amount of smoke lost with joints and blunts.Delahunty, Brendan; Putt, Judy. \\"http://www.ndlerf.gov.au/pub/Monograph_15.pdf\\" (2006), Monograph Series No. 15. National Drug Law Enforcement Research Fund. National Drug Strategy. However, once it is burnt and raised, the smoke can simply be breathed in while suspended in the chamber, with returning the bottle into the water to create additional upward pressure during inhalation essentially a matter of preference. Author Brian Griffin—who also wrote under a pseudonym—noted the aesthetic downside of a gravity bong to be that it looks like \\"something a janitor whipped up using items from his closet.\\" Griffin also wrote that the bong is quite difficult to conceal, saying: \\"they can be hard to hide if civic-minded parents or parole officers plan on making visits.\\" An author under the pseudonym Will B. High insisted that the bucket bong's existences was \\"indisputable evidence\\" that marijuana smokers were more intelligent and inventive than one might assume. I. M. Stoned, author of Weed: 420 Things You Didn't Know (or Remember) about Cannabis called the bucket bong \\"out of the world\\" and \\"killer sweet.\\" The Gravity Bong is often referred to as a \\"Buckie\\" in the Southern Hemisphere. =Waterfall bong= Diagram of waterfall bong in operation A waterfall bong (or reverse bucket bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle to act as a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke. =Lung= A \\"lung\\" or \\"parachute bong\\" with the bag pulled out of the chamber. A lung, also known as a parachute pipe/bong and a bread bag bong, is a device similar to both a gravity bucket bong and a waterfall, but which does not use water (and therefore is more portable), instead using suction created by placing an airtight malleable object into the smoke chamber, which is withdrawn to pull smoke into the vacated space. In its crudest form, it requires only an upper chamber and a taped plastic grocery bag or similar to provide the suction.How To : Bongs, Frederick Foote, Lulu.com, 2011, Strings are often added by solo users to assist the pulling, as the device requires to be both held upright and burned using hands, but can be raised steadily with the string (anchored) holding the bag in its original position to create the vacuum. In the early 21st century, more sophisticated commercial smoking devices were produced for countries where cannabis was decriminalised. One example, with a flat base and a concertina-style chamber that would expand to create the suction smoke chamber and contract to force the smoke into the users lungs, and for storage, was named Bukket but more similar to a lung in its method.The Bukket Bong, Namaste Vapes Comparison to other herbal consumption methods The bong is typically used for smoking cannabis and is generally not recommended for smoking tobacco or other herbal substances. The bong is, however, often marketed for use of tobacco, especially where marijuana smoking is illegal. The pressure created by the action of inhaling smoke into the user's lungs is very low when using a waterfall, contrary to other smoking devices, as gravity fills the chamber with smoke, creating less work for the smoker's lungs. The gravity bong differs from water pipes and water bongs in that it does not bubble the smoke through the water. Vaporizers do not produce smoke, but the inhalation process is similar. A joint can contain from 0.4 g to well over 1 g and blunts can contain up to 3 g of cannabis, while the bucket bong only uses about 0.1 to 0.3 g. Legal status Internationally, the sale of gravity bongs is often prohibited in countries where marijuana is illegal due to its association with the herb. In the United States, under the Federal Drug Paraphernalia Statute, which is part of the Controlled Substances Act, it is illegal to sell, transport through the mail, transport across state lines, import, or export drug paraphernalia, meaning that the bong is illegal.See United States v. Angelos, 433 F.3d 738 (10th Cir. 2006) (55 years for three sales of marijuana). Since Colorado, Oregon, and Washington have legalized recreational use of the herb, gravity bongs (along with other related paraphernalia) can be legally sold to anyone over the age of 21. In countries and states where use of cannabis is illegal, some retailers insist that bongs are intended for use with tobacco in an attempt to circumvent laws against selling drug paraphernalia. While technically the term \\"bong\\" does not mean a device used for smoking mainly marijuana, drug-related connotations have been formed with the word itself (partly due to punning with Sanskrit bhangah, meaning \\"hemp\\"). Thus for fear of the law some head shops will not serve customers who use the word \\"bong\\" or \\"bongs\\", typically insisting instead on the term \\"water pipe\\".

It is analogous to Boys Nation. The first American Legion Auxiliary Girls Nation was held August 9-August 14, 1947, with 82 girls and 41 states participating. It has been held each year subsequently. In order to attend the event, participating Girls State sessions select two participants to represent the state at Girls Nation. It, much like Girls State, is a \\"hands on\\" election simulation, only focusing on federal government rather than state government. These representatives, the Girls Nation \\"senators,\\" are divided into two political parties. The parties do not reflect the two major political parties in today's system, but allow citizens to gain a special knowledge of how the system works. Girls Nation is funded by the national organization of the Auxiliary, with some support from each participating state. Little or no expense is required of the representative or her family. The Auxiliary has been recognized many times by Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP) for outstanding Girls State and Girls Nation programs. It has also been recognized through the media in \\"Career World\\" magazine, WAM!, Children's Television Network (Encore Media Corporation), and many newspapers. The delegates of Girls Nation, alongside the American Legion's Boys Nation delegates, are additionally given the opportunity to meet the president as well as other House Representatives and Senators during their week long program. At this point in time, 100 girls attend Girls Nation. Hawaii began participation in Girls Nation in 2016. Program Goals The official goals of the program are to * Develop leadership and pride in American citizens; * Educate participants about our system of government; * Instill in participants a greater understanding of American traditions; * Stimulate a desire to maintain our government processes.

The French were led by Emperor Napoleon and the coalition army was under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher. The battle took place in severe weather conditions (wet snowstorm). The French were defeated but managed to hold until they could retreat under cover of darkness. Prelude On the 25 January 1814, Blücher entered Nancy, and, moving rapidly up the valley of the Moselle, was in communication with the Austrian advanced guard near La Rothière on the afternoon of the 28 January. On 29 January Napoleon attacked the Prussians. Blücher's headquarters were surprised and he himself nearly captured by a sudden rush of French troops (Battle of Brienne). Learning at the same time that the French Emperor in person was at hand, Blücher accordingly fell back a few miles next morning to a strong position covering the exits from the Bar-sur-Aube defile. The Austrian advance guard joined the Prussians and together they decided to accept battle—indeed they had no alternative, as the roads in rear were so choked with traffic that retreat was out of the question. Order of battle The French army counted about 45,000 men in 57 battalions and 62 squadrons, supported by 128 artillery pieces. The Imperial Guard was commanded by General of Division Philibert Jean-Baptiste Curial. Marshal Claude Perrin Victor led the II Corps with three infantry divisions under Generals of Division François Antoine Teste, Jean Corbineau, and Georges Mouton. General of Division Emmanuel Grouchy led the cavalry. On the Coalition side, Prince Scherbatov led the Russian 6th Corps, General-Leutnant Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev directed the Russian 9th Corps, Count Liewen III commanded the Russian 11th Corps, Feldzeugmeister Ignaz Gyulai led the Austrian 3rd Corps, Crown Prince Frederick William of Württemberg directed the 4th Corps, General der Kavallerie Karl Philipp von Wrede commanded the Austro-Bavarian 5th Corps, and there were several independent cavalry divisions. The multinational coalition forces used white shoulder bands to distinguish friends from foes during the battle. Battle About noon the 2 February Napoleon attacked, but the weather was terrible, and the ground so heavy that his favourite artillery, the mainstay of his whole system of warfare, was useless and in the drifts of snow which at intervals swept across the field, the columns lost their direction and many were severely handled by the Cossacks. At nightfall the fighting ceased and the French retired to Lesmont, leaving Marmont behind to observe Coalition movements. Historian Digby Smith stated that French losses numbered 4,600 killed and wounded. The Coalition captured an additional 1,000 soldiers and 73 guns. The large loss of artillery was partly due to Coalition cavalry superiority and partly due to the soggy condition of the ground, which made it difficult to withdraw the pieces. The Coalition lost between 6,000 and 7,000 casualties. Aftermath From Lesmont, the French moved to Troyes. Owing to the state of the roads, more perhaps to the extraordinary lethargy which always characterized Schwarzenberg's headquarters, no pursuit was attempted.

The three estates were also called the States. Supported by the economic strength of the cities Antwerp, Brussels and Leuven, the States always were an important power before the rulers of the country, as was reflected by the charter of the duchy. After the duchy of Brabant and all Seventeen Provinces of the Netherlands came under the rule of the dukes of Burgundy, the States of Brabant became the host of the States-General of the Netherlands, who used to assemble in Brussels. In 1579 and 1580, during the Eighty Years' War, most cities and States of Brabant joined Dutch independence declaration (Union of Utrecht and Act of Abjuration), but Spanish troops reconquered most of the territory of the duchy and restored Spanish Catholic rule (except for North Brabant. See also Siege of Antwerp (1584-1585)). By the end of 1789, the States of Brabant again declared independence, this time from Austrian imperial rule, and, on January 11, 1790, they joined the United States of Belgium. All Southern Netherlands \\"States\\" disappeared four years later because of the French revolutionary occupation.

It intersects the neighbourhoods of South Calgary, Altadore, Garrison Woods and the southeastern part of the community of Richmond - Knob Hill. The Marda Loop name originated with the BIA, but also applies generically to the surrounding community, and also to the residential Marda Loop Communities Association. This entry is primarily about the Marda Loop BIA. (Note, until recently it was Marda Loop BRZ) Marda Loop Square The area has become one of Calgary's most popular outdoor shopping venues. Businesses consist of small-scale retailers, coffee shops, and pubs. The BIA hosts an annual street festival, the Marda Gras Street Festival, on the second Sunday in August. The area is named after Marc and Mada Jenkins, who were the owners of the local Marda Theatre (later Odeon Theatre), the name being a combination of their two names. (The theatre was opened in 1953, closed in 1989 and was demolished in 1990.) The \\"Loop\\" refers to the street car loop, and later a trolley bus turnaround, that was a feature of the area. The name was chosen in a contest conducted by the BIA (ex. BRZ) in 1985. Historically, the area has always been a hub of commercial activity for that part of the city. In the late 1990s the community saw a major change due to the departure of nearby Canadian Forces Base Calgary and the closure of the PMQ (Permanent Married Quarters) area. In the early 2000s the PMQs were redeveloped as Garrison Woods, including a residential area and many new shops grew the Marda Loop business district. Since around 2010 there has been a large upswing in the business and residential community due to substantial redevelopment in the area and the community has regained some of its historical vibrancy. Recently there has been a significant increase in housing density in the surrounding neighbourhoods, as older homes are giving way to new higher density condominiums. Marda Loop is becoming a trendy area with an influx of higher income households and new businesses. Evidence of the shift towards a younger and more dynamic population can be seen in new and emerging community events and facilities. The area hosts an annual film festival, a Yoga & Meditation Community Center, and an annual street festival aptly named \\"Marda Gras\\".

While airborne, the skateboarder makes two-and-a-half turns about their longitudinal axis, thereby facing down when coming down. It is considered one of skateboarding's most technically demanding tricks. Pre-Hawk A number of opinions exist about pre-1999 900s. The most prominent of these is the argument that Danny Way landed the 900 in 1989, and it appears in an early Santa Cruz film. In 1999 Tony Hawk said: Tony Hawk, one of the most successful vertical pro skateboarders in the world, landed \\"The 900\\" at the 1999 X-Games after ten failed attempts. It was past regulation time but, as one announcer said, \\"We make up the rules as we go along. Let's give him another try.\\" Other skaters protested, but Hawk continued. Hawk twice landed on his board, but it flew out from under him. When he finally completed the trick, his arms windmilled and his hand barely grazed the ramp. Nonetheless, he rode away. Even though he landed the 900 (after the time limit), he was not awarded 1st place in the \\"Best Trick\\" event. In his book, the 900 was the last on the wishlist of tricks Hawk had written a decade earlier. Other tricks on the list included the ollie 540, kickflip 540, and varial 720. In a 1999 interview, Hawk said he does not have \\"any desire to spin further\\". He did, however, successfully land the trick during press interviews for the video game Tony Hawk: Ride and at the \\"Tony Hawk: RIDE Presents Stand Up for Skate Parks\\" event. In 2011 Hawk was still able to land his famous 900 and posted a video of the trick via his Twitter account stating \\"I'm 43 and I did a 900 today.\\" On June 27, 2016, Hawk successfully landed another 900 at age 48, 17 years to the day from when he completed his first at the X-Games, and indicated that it would likely be his last 900.

In May of 2020, 11 year-old Brazilian Gui Khury became the first person to land a 1080 using only a vert ramp (no mega ramp, or lead in). Other sports The 900 can also be attempted on a BMX bike, skis, snowboard, inline skates or a scooter. BMX-Rider Mat Hoffman was the first person to successfully land the 900 on film at a competition in Canada in 1989. At the 2002 X Games, Hoffman took the trick a step further by landing a no-handed 900. Simon Tabron's signature trick is the 900. In the 2007 X Games 13 Simon Tabron landed the first back-to-back 900s. Because the gear of snowboarders, skiers, and inline skaters is affixed to their feet, the 900 is not considered to be a difficult trick for professionals in those sports and is performed rather often. 1620 and 1800 degree spins have been landed on skis, a 1620 has been performed on a snowboard as well as on inline skates, 1080 on BMX, 1080 on scooter.

Journalist Born Joseph Brand Whitlock in Urbana, Ohio, son of the Rev. Elias and Mollie Lavinia (Brand) Whitlock, he was educated in the public schools and by private tutors. Rather than attend college, Whitlock began working as a reporter for several papers in Toledo, Ohio, including The Toledo Blade. In 1891, he moved to Chicago to work for The Chicago Herald. He covered baseball, including longtime Chicago captain- manager Cap Anson, whom he sometimes referred to in print as \\"Grampa.\\" He also covered the 1892 Republican National Convention and the 1892 Illinois legislative session. Whitlock joined the Whitechapel Club. Springfield, Illinois The Holy Trinity, as Ohio mayors (L-R) Henry Thomas Hunt of Cincinnati, Brand Whitlock of Toledo, and Newton D. Baker of Cleveland were called following the mayoral elections of November 4, 1911. His political writing attracted attention by Illinois politicians, and Whitlock was offered a job as Gov. John Peter Altgeld's personal secretary; instead he took a position with the Secretary of State. While in Springfield, he also studied the law under Senator J. M. Palmer; he was admitted to the bar in 1894, at the age of 25. Whitlock had married Susan Brainerd in 1892, but she died four months after their wedding. In 1895 he married again, choosing her sister Nell Brainerd. In 1893, Whitlock prepared the pardon documents for the Haymarket Affair's convicted men: Fielden, Neebe, and Schwab. After Gov. Altgeld signed the pardons, Whitlock commented, \\"The storm will break now,\\" to which the governor replied, \\"It was merely doing right.\\" Whitlock became very active in Illinois Democratic Party politics. In 1894, he was Chair of the Democratic Finance Committee and in charge of arrangements for the state convention. Attorney and mayor of Toledo, Ohio After the defeat of Gov. Altgeld in 1896, Whitlock returned to Toledo in 1897, where he established a successful legal practice. Whitlock provided legal services to the Mayor of Toledo, Samuel M. Jones, a.k.a. \\"Golden Rule\\" Jones. In one case, Whitlock successfully argued to overturn the Ohio state statutes that governed municipalities. Whitlock entered politics more directly in Toledo, running on the Independent ticket for mayor; he was elected four times from 1906 to 1914. He was one of a number of Progressive politicians elected as mayors of major Midwestern cities in 1911. He declined a fifth nomination as mayor when recruited for a diplomatic post. Ambassador to Belgium Brand Whitlock and his wife in New York City in 1915 Mayor Brand Whitlock, Newsboys' Building Site Ground Breaking Ceremony, 1908, Toledo, Ohio After finishing his last term as mayor, in 1913 Whitlock was appointed minister to Belgium by President Wilson. When the First World War broke out, his responsibilities were increased as he was given representation for seven additional countries in wartime. His position was extremely sensitive after the German occupation of Belgium. His adroit performance of his duties in the office won him an international reputation for tact, zeal, and efficiency. Whitlock ensured food aid sent by the Committee for Relief in Belgium went to Belgian citizens rather than the German occupation forces. With the United States' declaration of war against Germany in April 1917, Whitlock needed to leave Belgium. He insisted on ensuring he accompanied other Americans out of Belgium, and crossed into Switzerland, which was neutral. During the war, he visited King Albert of Belgium at the Allied battle front. After the signing of the armistice in November 1918 and the restoration of the Belgian government, Whitlock returned to Brussels as minister. In 1919, he went to the United States for a visit. While he was at home, the United States' representation in Belgium was raised to rank of an embassy, and Whitlock became an ambassador. Writings Whitlock wrote numerous newspaper articles, short stories, novels, essays, biographies, non-fiction and memoirs. His novels dealt with political and social issues. The anarchist activist Emma Goldman described Whitlock's novel The Turn of the Balance as \\"the greatest American exposé of crime in the making\\" and argued that its characters demonstrate \\"how the legal aspects of crime, and the methods of dealing with it, help to create the disease which is undermining our entire social life.\\" Non-fiction * (1908).

It was commanded by General Vasily Volsky during the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942. The corps entered the sector south of Stalingrad as part of Operation Uranus. The plan was to attack through the 51st Army's sector to obtain an encirclement by cutting through the Romanian Fourth Army led by Constantin Constantinescu. On 20 November 1942, the Corps started feeding its initial units into the attack, between Lake Tsatsa and Barmatsak when the 126th and 302nd Rifle Divisions of 51st Army began to advance on a three-mile front supported by the 55th and 158th Independent Tank Regiments from 4th Mech Corps. The advance was made against the Romanian 6th Corps, whose units, Erickson says, began to surrender as the tanks got in among their positions. The Corps's main attack opened late, further down the line, with three mechanised brigades hugging one road instead of the planned three, and the left-flank brigades, 36th and 59th, running into minefields. However the attack went on, until a pause at Zety on the evening on 21 November for fuel and ammunition. On the morning of 23 November, 4 Mechanised Corps linked up with 4th and 26th Tank Corps in the Sovietskii-Marinovka area and the northern and southern pincers had met. The German Sixth Army was surrounded in Stalingrad. In December 1942 the Corps gained a Guards title and became the 3rd Guards Mechanised Corps. It fought at the Battle of Kursk as part of Steppe Front. In June 1944, for Operation Bagration, it was assigned to Chernyakhovsky's 3rd Belorussian Front as part of a Cavalry Mechanized Group which also included 3rd Cavalry Corps and was tasked to hit Bogushevsk in conjunction with 5th Army and 39th Army.Erickson, Road to Berlin, 1982, p.213 Its units included 64th Guards Heavy Tank Regiment, which operated IS-2 heavy tanks while fighting as part of the 1st Baltic Front in the Šiauliai ('Shaulay') area during July 1944.The Russian Battlefield It was then moved to the Far East and took part in the invasion of Manchuria as part of the Transbaikal Front.Soviet Far East Command, 9 August 1945  Post War  The Corps, which gained the honorific Stalingrad-Krivorozhskaya, became 3rd Guards Mechanised Division in November 1945, and later 47th Guards Motor Rifle Division in 1957.

It was demolished in 1957-58.YouTube video of visit to the site of the Hall History The Hall dated from the reign of King Henry III and at one time was given by Henry VIII to his daughter, Princess Elizabeth (Queen Elizabeth I of England). The Hall was once a possession of the Knights of St John of Jerusalem. It was owned by the Hibbit family for over forty years between 1823 and 1867. The owner William Hibbit (c1770–1840) inherited the titles lord of the manor and 'patron of the living'. During this period the Hibbit's were responsible for many alterations to both the Hall and the grounds. These included construction of a hospital wing and extensive landscaping of the gardens. The stable block was a focal meeting point for the Blakesley Hunt during their residence. The family connections with Blakesley extended to the local church St Mary The Virgin, where they were celebrated patrons (a plaque is on display near the altar). The beautiful sandstone font, donated by one of William's sons, the Reverend Arthur Hibbit BA (Cambridge) (1818–1893), the vicar of St. Mary's, is still in use for baptisms. Ownership of the Hall for the years between 1867 and 1875 was shrouded in mystery and intrigue with contestation of wills and estate claims abounding. The hall was owned by Charles William Bartholomew, a civil engineer, from 1876 to 1919. In 1903, Bartholemew constructed a -gauge ridable Blakesley Miniature Railway. The narrow-gauge line ran the half a mile from Blakesley station on the closed Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway to the Hall. It carried coal, farm supplies and the occasional passenger and when the Hall became a military hospital during the first world war, the line was used to rehabilitate patients. The track was lifted in 1940. One of the engines run on the miniature railway was a 4-4-4T internal combustion locomotive (with a steam outline) named Blackolvesley and built by Bassett-Lowke of Northampton in 1909.Blackolvesley at the Saltburn Miniature Railway normally at Ravenglass & Eskdale Railway Recent developments More recently, local architectural designers, the Roger Coy Partnership based in Eydon, have been granted planning permission to undertake work on their proposed recreation of the hall.Roger Cot Partnership, accessed 23 December 2015 The current owner discovered a stream by landscape gardeners, James Pulham and Son (a firm which specialized in the production of simulated rock, known as Pulham Rock, for garden features in the 19th century)The Pulham Legacy - about James Pulham and Son while clearing the grounds in readiness for the redevelopment.

On June 12, 2007 the casino was purchased by the CIM Group for over $100 million. Workers tearing down portions of the casino for renovation in October 2012.In July 2008 the city was investigating rezoning the nearby land containing the transit center to unrestricted gaming. With the transit center relocated, the land would be available for development. Mayor Oscar Goodman applauded the attempt to re- invigorate the plans to renovate the Lady Luck: \\"For the past several years I have seen a rotting corpse. The Lady Luck structure has been a blight.\\" As of July 2009, Goodman once again said in a council meeting that \\"The Lady Luck is a disaster,\\" and then called the skeletal structure a \\"carcass\\". Las Vegas city leaders wanted CIM Group to raze the unfinished structure at Fourth Street and Stewart Avenue and do a better job of keeping sidewalks and landscaping clean near the site. CIM had until late December 2009 to begin a $100 million renovation of the Lady Luck; otherwise, it would potentially lose an offer from the city which would hand over land around the proposed nearby Mob Museum. On July 23, 2009, some demolition work started on a 4-story concrete building adjacent to the main resort. This work was completed in accordance with the city's request for CIM Group to raze the condemned structure. On March 15, 2010, CIM Group made an agreement with city officials to have the renovations completed by December 31, 2011. There was the potential that the hotel/casino would reopen in 2012, five years after its originally scheduled reopening in 2007. In October 2011, plans were announced to rename the Lady Luck as the Downtown Grand. The property underwent a $100 million renovation.

It was the last-ditch effort by the Burmese to drive out the British from Lower Burma. The poorly equipped Burmese army despite the advantage in numbers suffered a defeat. The British army's subsequent march toward north threatened Ava, which led to peace negotiation by the Kingdom of Burma. Following the defeat at Danubyu and the death of General Maha Bandula, King Bagyidaw ordered the general Maha Ne Myo to capture Prome with an army. With superiority in number, the Burmese army divided into three divisions and positioned themselves around Prome in Simbaik, Napadi hills, and the western shore of Irrawaddy river. The Burmese army harassed the British position in outlying regions around Prome by leading small raids but did not commit to an attack on Prome itself. The British army, led by Gen. Archibald Campbell, composed of several regiments of Royal Foot infantry and Madras Native infantry and artillery. On 1 December 1825, General Campbell initiated an attack on the left division led by Maha Ne Myo, while distracting the centre division with a cannon barrage. The left division was stormed with a bayonet charge led by Lt. General Willoughby Cotton and a follow up attack by General Campbell caused a complete rout of the left division of the Burmese army. The British army attacked the center division on the Napadi hills the following day, and due to the bravery of the Native infantry, drove the Burmese troops from the hills. An attack on the right division, situated on the western shore of Irrawaddy river, caused a general retreat of the Burmese army. Background After defeating the Burmese army and their commander-in-chief Maha Bandula at Danubyu in April 1825, the British consolidated their gains in Lower Burma (up to Prome), Arakan and Tenasserim coast as well as in Assam and Manipur. Initial peace negotiations were commenced in September 1825 at Ngagyaungbinzeik, 20 miles north of Prome.Phayre, p. 253 The British demanded that the Burmese recognize \\"the independence of Manipur\\" and \\"desist from interference with Assam and Cachar\\", \\"cede Rakhine and its dependencies\\", receive a British Resident at the Court of Ava, and pay an indemnity of two million pounds sterling. Yangon, and Taninthayi would be held until the indemnity was paid.Myint-U, pp. 122–124 The Court of Ava had not expected, and were unwilling to accept, the full dismemberment of their western empire and the crushing penalty demanded. But with the army severely depleted, the Burmese envoy, the lord of Kawlin, replied that his government: # Would give up any claim to Assam and Manipur # Objected to the British choice for the future Manipuri raja # Would cede the Tenasserim coast but not Arakan. The British were unimpressed: \\"The question is not how much you will cede to us but how much we shall return to you\\". The negotiations broke down, and the Burmese decided to fight on despite the fact that the army was severely short of experienced men and arms. (The army's most experienced men had already perished in the previous year. The Burmese lost about 23,000 men in the Battle of Rangoon (May–December 1824) alone.) Over the rainy season of 1825 (June–October), they had raised more men, and the entire Burmese defences now consisted of 30,000 soldiers. However, most of the new conscripts were \\"ill-trained and ill-equipped\\". Combatants =Burmese Army= The Burmese army responsible for attack on Prome consisted mainly of Shans, and the total strength was about 10,000 men.Hteik Tin Htwe, pp. 336-340 By one account, the non-Shan portion of the army was only 1300.Maung Maung Tin, Vol. 2, p. 278 (The post-war British reporting claim a combined Burmese strength of 50,000 to 60,000. However, later British historians such as GE Harvey reassessed that the Konbaung Dynasty could have raised no more than 60,000 men for the entire war.Harvey, pp. 333–335) The Burmese command had also posted a 3,000-strong army led by Minhla Minkhaung at the western bank of the Irrawaddy north of Prome as a defensive measure. =British Army= Under the command of General Cotton: *Royal Foot Infantry: 1st, 41st (270 men), and 89th (260 men) regiments *Madras Native Infantry: 18th and 28th regiments *250 Royal Engineers *100 Pioneers *Some artillery Under the command of General Campbell: *Royal Foot Infantry: 13th, 38th, 47th, and 87th regiments *The Madras European Regiment *Madras Native Infantry: 3rd, 7th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 34th, 43rd, 38th regiment *Bengal Native Infantry: 40th Regiment Defence at Prome: *Four Madras Native Infantry regiments Battle In November 1825, the Burmese forces under Maha Ne Myo mainly consisted of several Shan regiments led by their own Shan sawbwas, made a daring push to recapture Pyay, and nearly succeeded. But by early December, the superior firepower of the British had won out and defeated the last-ditch effort by the Burmese. Following the rainy season, the Burmese army in three columns approached Prome. Both flanks of the British position were threatened, but the control of the river was maintained by the command of the flotilla and a detachment, 26th Madras Native Infantry, at Padaung on the right bank. Despite their superiority in numbers, the Burmese forces remained in the protection of the cover of the jungle for several days after their arrival and maintained harassments against the British flanks. As noted by The Annual Register, Burmese warfare style at that time involved \\"creeping onwards slowly and certainly, stockading and entrenching ... at every step, risking no general engagement ...\\". On 1 December General Campbell left four regiments of native infantry in Prome and marched against the division of Maha Ne Myo at Sinbaik, on the left position. To divert the attention of the centre position, a cannon barrage of the flotilla, led by Sir James Brisbane, commenced against the works on the river coordinated with Campbell's march. The barrage was maintained for approximately two hours to maintain the diversion. At the Nawin (Naweng) river, the British army was divided into two columns, and the two columns marched parallel to each other along the river. The right column, led by Brigadier-General Cotton, first encountered the left division of Burmese army, estimated to be 10,000 men strong. The British stormed the Burmese position with a bayonet charge, and caused the Burmese to rout. The left column encountered the retreating Burmese finished their rout. Despite their swift defeat, the Shans troops were noted for their bravery; according to The Annual Register, the Shans \\" ... fought bravely ... [and] maintained the contest till the greater part of them were cut down.\\" On 2 December, after the rout of Maha Ne Myo of the left division, Campbell was quick to follow up with an attack on the centre division of the Burmese army, led by Kee-Woonghee, on the Napadi hills. An attack against the defence at the base of the hills was led by six companies of the 87th regiment, and the Burmese army was quickly overwhelmed, retreating to the defensive positions on the hills. The Burmese army maintained a strong position on the Napadi hills, which were accessible only by a narrow road and guarded with artillery. The British army employed a multi-prong attack on the hills: the 13th and 38th regiment of the 1st Bengal brigade engaged the Burmese army from the front while the 87th regiment engaged from the right. The Burmese army was driven from the hills subsequently, and as a result, the two divisions positioned on the eastern shore of the Irrawaddy river had been routed. On 5 December an attack on the Burmese division led by Minhla Minkhaung commenced with the transport of the troops to the western shore of Irrawaddy river. A rocket brigade and a mortar battery opened fire at the Burmese position and the Burmese troops retreated from the artillery attack. A manned attack led by General Cotton, Brigadier Richard Armstrong, and Colonel Godwin stormed the Burmese position immediately following the artillery attack and dispersed the remaining Burmese troops. Aftermath With a large portion of the Burmese army dispersed at Prome, the British army led by Campbell advanced toward Ava unimpeded until they encountered a stockaded defence at Bagan. Due to a diminished military power, the Kingdom of Burma was more inclined to negotiate for peace and accept the terms and demands posed by the British. The first of such negotiations took place on 1 January 1826.

A native of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he founded the Knitting Factory, a New York City music performance venue, and City Winery, a chain of restaurants that feature live music and wine. Dorf is also a philanthropist who hosts many charity events and donates the proceeds of his tribute concerts at Carnegie Hall to various charities.  Career  = Knitting Factory era = In 1986, at the age of 23, Dorf started the Knitting Factory in the East Village. The Knitting Factory later became a widely known club for jazz and rock music. A spin-off entertainment company, KnitMedia, eventually established Knitting Factory Records. KnitMedia promoted a number of music festivals, including the \\"What is Jazz Festival.\\" In 1996, Dorf founded the Digital Club Network with partner Andrew Rasiej. During this time they also started the Macintosh Music Festival which became the first live concert streaming. In 1998 they had 250,000 users watching the concert live. The business grew and was eventually acquired by eMusic Group. 2002 was a tough year for the Knitting Factory following the September 11 attacks, resulting in a significant reduction of staff. By 2003 Dorf had diluted himself out of a controlling position in the company. = Post Knitting Factory = Dorf started Tribeca Hebrew as an after-school program for his two boys and several other friends. In 2004, he rented a small storefront in Tribeca and brought in other families to help fund the school, which quickly grew to 120 kids under his leadership as the Chairman in the first two years. In 2009, the school merged with JCP. = City Winery = In 2008, Dorf started City Winery. on June 4, 2017 MSNBC reported that the company generated over $1 million in profits. Since City Winery's inception in 2008, Dorf has expanded the company to five cities which include New York, Chicago, Nashville, Atlanta, and Boston. While City Winery is a concert venue as well as a restaurant, it is also a fully functioning winery, with its New York City location producing around 9,000 cases of wine a year. City Winery has not been without its missteps, with a failure of its Napa Valley location, which Dorf attributed to Napa's lack of urban environment central to the City Winery theme. However, in 2018 he made a deal to purchase the Montgomery Worsted Mills building in Montgomery, New York, in a rural area of Orange County, and turn it into another location. Besides City Winery, Dorf has also opened another restaurant in New York City called City Vineyard. While City Vineyard at Pier 26 has ties to City Winery, it's a stand alone restaurant that does not make wine like its sibling restaurants. City Winery is similar to its predecessor, Riverwalk in Chicago, which is also tied to City Winery. In September 2017 City Winery signed a 5 year lease extension on its original 155 Varick St.NYC location, a deal which included a $2m renovation of the upper floor into a new venue 'The Loft', which opened in May 2018. In July 2018, just as renovations were finished, the landlord Trinity Church announced they had leased the entire block to the Walt Disney Company for redevelopment. and that City Winery was to be evicted via a \\"demolition clause\\" in the lease. In January 2019 Dorf sued Trinity Church for $2m to recover his investment. On July 28, 2019 the New York Daily News published a lengthy op-ed by Dorf casting the story as a cautionary tale, but also mentioning a forthcoming move to a \\"sparkling new 32,000-square-foot City Winery at Pier 57 at Hudson River Park early next year.\\". The Varick St location closed on July 31, 2019. A New York Post story detailed the difficulties of moving \\"14 huge aluminum tanks and 350 wooden barrels filled with anywhere from 210 to 2,000 gallons of wine\\".  Philanthropy  Dorf is chairman of Labshul, a non profit organization which defines itself as \\"everybody friendly, God-optional, and an experimental community gathering\\" in NYC for primarily Jewish individuals and families. Dorf is also a board member of the American Symphony Orchestra. He is on the boards of The Jewish Week and Newport Festivals, the parent organization of both the Newport Jazz Festival and the Newport Folk Festival.  Michael Dorf Presents  Dorf has produced a number of tribute concerts at Carnegie Hall, the Apollo Theater, Central Park summer stage, Lincoln Center, The Beacon Theatre. To date, he has honored: * Bob Dylan * Bruce Springsteen * R.E.M. * The Who * David Bowie * Jimmy Webb * David Byrne & Talking Heads * Paul Simon * Prince * The Rolling Stones * Robert Johnson * Neil Young * Simon & Garfunkel * I'm Not There * Neil Sedaka * Elton John & Bernie Taupin * Joni Mitchell * Van Morrison  Personal life  Dorf has two siblings, Julie Dorf and Josh Dorf, and is the eldest of them.

Ragnarok is a freeware roguelike video game for DOS, created by Norsehelm Productions (Thomas F. Boyd and Rob Vawter) from 1992 to 1995, also going by the name Valhalla in its European release. It is distinct from many other roguelikes in having a graphical interface, a historical/mythological setting, set quests, the ability to change classes, and the ability to permanently change one's race by polymorphing.  Mythology  Ragnarok is firmly set within the bounds of Norse mythology, with many of the gods, realms, items, and quests drawing directly from it. A few of these present in the game are: * Thor, god of thunder * Jormundgand, god, the world serpent * Loki, god, mischievous troublemaker * Balder, fair god murdered by Loki * Hela, god, queen of Niflheim * Mjollnir, Thor's hammer * Gungnir, Odin's spear * Mimming, Freyr's sword * Gjall, Heimdall's Horn * Skidbladnir, a boat belonging to the gods * Ravens, benevolent monsters, messengers of Odin * Nidhogg, monster, a dragon-like being who chews on the roots of Yggdrasil * Dwarves, monsters, mythological smiths * Giants, monsters, Ymir's kin * Midgard, location, realm of men * Niflheim, location, realm of the dead However, other items and monsters are of a more \\"generic fantasy,\\" Japanese- inspired or Tolkienesque nature, such as orcs and katana.  Character development  Character development is one of the chief draws of Ragnarok. Throughout the game, the player may change forms, to obtain the powers and abilities of almost any monster in the game, with the exception of god and demi-god level creatures. The player can also modify their own body, changing the number of fingers and eyes, and the gender of the character. The player also has the option of changing their class every ten levels, and can gain powers, skills, abilities and permanent status effects. Therefore, it is quite possible to begin the game as a male sage, and end the game as a lycanthropic female Fire Giant conjurer with 14 fingers and 3 eyes that shoot laser beams. Some ways to develop your character are: * Scroll of Knowledge, grants the player one active ability. * Eating a dead body, there are many different creatures in the game that when killed and eaten give you a variety of different passive abilities. And in a few rare cases causes transformation. * Wand of Polymorph, cast on yourself to transform yourself. Be warned however, the transformation is random and sometimes makes your situation worse. You can become any creature in the game, that includes weak monsters such as rats, who cannot carry a proper inventory or wield weaponry. * Potion of Transformation, works just like the Wand of Polymorph but is made with the use of the Alchemy skill. * Werewolves, pass on the curse of Lycanthropy when they attack you. * The sage class gives you the ability to write a scroll that lets you switch into the body of the most powerful creature on your current map. This has a few downsides, though - Your previous body retains your inventory and abilities, so you will have to kill your old body in order to get the items and work to regain all your old abilities. Also, many times you will already be the most powerful creature on the map, due to all the magic items and innate abilities you can collect.  Class system  In the beginning of the game, the player must choose a character class. These classes all have intrinsic statistics. At level ten, the player \\"masters\\" a class, and gains all the skills that the class can use. The player can then choose a new class, or continue as the old class for another ten levels. There are six classes: * Viking - a physically strong character who gains the weaponmaster ability. Weapon mastery allows the player to do maximum damage with all weapons, and gives the player a free second turn from time to time. * Blacksmith - a physically powerful character who gains the ability to work metals into weapons and armor. The blacksmith is able to forge The Runesword, a powerful, one-of-a-kind weapon. * Woodsman - a moderately powerful character, who learns to make arrows from trees, to tame lesser (beast) monsters, to swim, and to terraform the terrain. * Conjurer - a physically weak character who learns to cast spells. In addition to using spells like the touch of death, the conjurer is able to teleport, and funnel charges from one wand to another. * Alchemist - a physically weak character who learns to mix potions. A master alchemist is able to make the Potion of Second Life, which as the name suggests brings the player back to life as soon as he is killed. * Sage - a physically weak character who learns to write scrolls. A master sage can write a powerful, one-of-a-kind Switch Bodies scroll. After the player has mastered every class, their class matters much less. Initially, it is more important, since being a stronger fighter makes the beginning of the game easier, and some classes become powerful once mastered. Ghosts One element of Ragnarok gameplay is that slain player characters leave behind 'ghost data' for the next adventurer to encounter. This data includes the slain adventurer's inventory (minus a few rare items) and the map state as it was at the time of death, including all opponents. From time to time such ghosts present a play challenge, such as might be the case in 'choke point' maps where a player cannot advance due to the large number of ghosts in the area. Quests The game consists of six quests based on Norse mythology. They are: # Free Balder's soul. # Locate and return Mjollnir to Thor. # Locate and return Gjallarhorn to Heimdall. # Locate and return Mimming to Freyr. # Locate and return Gungnir to Odin. # Find a manner for Tyr to fight with one hand.

He is best known for his work in social marketing, spearheading high-profile national social campaigns on designated driving, youth violence, and youth mentoring. He also serves as Senior Communications Advisor to the United Nations Special Envoy for Malaria. Trained as a molecular biologist, Winsten served as co-editor of the three-volume work, Origins of Human Cancer with Nobel laureate James Watson and Howard Hiatt, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health. Winsten's 1985 study, Science and the Media: The Boundaries of Truth, was praised by the Columbia Journalism Review as a \\"landmark study on the relationship between science and the press.\\" Social campaigns =Designated drivers= As founding director of the Center for Health Communication, Winsten was the driving force behind the Harvard Alcohol Project, which introduced and popularized the social concept of the designated driver in the United States in the late 1980s, and is credited for contributing to lower rates of driving under the influence. The Harvard Alcohol Project solicited involvement from the broadcasting industry to spread the concept not only through public service announcements and news coverage, but through the inclusion of designated driving themes and references in popular television programs. The campaign is considered the first successful effort to mobilize the Hollywood creative community on a large scale to promote health messages, having facilitated use of the campaign theme in more than 160 prime time shows during the 1988-1992 television seasons. Sparking a national movement, with endorsements by renowned leaders in a broad range of professional fields, the strategy pioneered by the campaign was later emulated by other interest groups. =Youth violence= Following the success of the Harvard Alcohol Project, Winsten and colleagues used the same approach in a second social marketing initiative, The \\"Squash It!\\" Campaign to Prevent Youth Violence, launched in 1994. \\"Squash It!\\" centered around the use of the \\"squash it\\" phrase and an associated hand gesture to promote a social norm of walking away from potentially violent confrontations by framing it as \\"cool\\" and smart, rather than cowardly. The \\"Squash It!\\" meme was incorporated in a wide variety of television programs, films, and rap songs. The \\"squash\\" gesture, based on the time-out signal in sports, is performed by bringing the palm of a flat hand down onto a vertical clenched fist, forming a stylized \\"T\\". Though not considered as successful as the designated driver campaign, based on a national survey of junior and senior high school students, \\"Squash It!\\" was found to be particularly influential with African-Americans, its primary target group. =Youth mentoring= Winsten headed a communications task force which helped to plan the 1997 Presidents' Summit on America's Future in Philadelphia, chaired by General Colin Powell. As an outgrowth of the Summit, Winsten and colleagues began to shift focus to youth mentoring with the launch of the Harvard Mentoring Project, organizing a year-round national media campaign from 1998 to 2001 with support from the major broadcast television networks. In 2002, the campaign developed into National Mentoring Month, a focused campaign held each January to recruit volunteer mentors for at-risk youth. National Mentoring Month won the support of three successive U.S. presidents, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, helping to establish mentoring as an important national priority.

Her books, particularly The Vampire Diaries and Night World, have been in the New York Times Best Seller list and have been nominated for five awards.  Early life and education  Smith was born in Orange County, California. Her reported date of birth varies, with sources noting as early as 1958 or 1959 or as late as 1965. As a child, she grew up in Villa Park, California and attended Villa Park High School. It was here that her high school English teacher, Zoe Gibbs, gave Smith the confidence to write. Smith studied experimental psychology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She later attended San Francisco State University to obtain teaching credentials.  Career  Smith began her career as an elementary school teacher, but left in 1989 after three years to pursue writing. Smith has said that she realized she wanted to be a writer sometime between kindergarten and first grade, \\"when a teacher praised a horrible poem I'd written\\",L.J. Smith Biography: amazon.com Retrieved 2010-12-23. and she began writing in earnest in elementary school.Interview with Novelist L.J. Smith: nightworld.net Retrieved 2010-12-23. Her first book, The Night of the Solstice, written during high school and college, was published by MacMillan in 1987, followed by Heart of Valor in 1990. They sold poorly, as they were labeled for 9 to 11-year-olds and not for young adults, as Smith wanted. The Vampire Diaries series was commissioned by Elise Donner, editor of Alloy Entertainment in 1990: Smith immediately wrote the scene when Elena, Bonnie and Meredith are decorating the gym and the heroine meets Damon (scene later included in the first novel), while, as for the other characters, she adapted those of The Garden of Earthly Delights, an adult book she was writing. She chose the setting of The Vampire Diaries in Virginia because she has family there and was inspired by the small towns and lifestyles. Three trilogies followed: The Secret Circle (1992), The Forbidden Game (1994) and Dark Visions (1995). The first installment of Night World series was published in 1996, followed by eight more over the next two years.L.J.

The final volume of The Vampire Diaries written entirely by Smith (The Return: Midnight) was released in March 2011. Smith submitted a draft of the next installment (The Hunters: Phantom), but after a dispute regarding a pivotal plot twist, her involvement was terminated by the publisher and the episode was revised by a ghostwriter. Subsequent Vampire Diaries installments have also been ghostwritten. She was also replaced on The Secret Circle series, by ghostwriter Aubrey Clark.  Personal life  Smith previously resided in Concord, California in 1991 and still resides in Northern California with her dog. In 1998, Smith took a decade-long hiatus from writing to take care of her sister's children when her brother-in-law was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma. During this time, her mother died from lung cancer. In late 2015, Smith was diagnosed with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

The neighbourhood is bounded by 17th Avenue SW on the north, 26th Avenue SW on the south, 14th Street SW on the east and 19th Street SW on the west. It is a residential neighbourhood located southwest of the high density Beltline district of the inner city. History William Nimmons purchased the lands of the present day Bankview neighbourhood from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1882, for ranching and farming. He established the 3-D-Bar Ranch on these lands, and later a sandstone quarry and a theater (the Mount Royal Theatre). The Nimmons residence, built in 1884, is now a heritage building, and still stands in the northeast corner of Bankview. By 1902, during a housing shortage due to 1900s economic boom, Nimmons divided the land, and begun selling plots to newly arrived settlers. In 1908, the remainder of the land was bought by the City of Calgary, and was divided in the traditional grid system. Bankview was established as a neighbourhood in 1908. The district saw a major redesign in 1950, allowing for higher density apartment buildings and the community now has an area redevelopment plan in place. Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, Bankview had a population of living in dwellings, a 9.8% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012.

The original stories were: *\\"The Chosen People\\" (Astounding SF, June 1956) *\\"The Promised Land\\" (Astounding SF, August 1956) *False Prophet\\" (Astounding SF, December 1956; also front cover art) All the stories relate to the fictional planet Nidor and the effects on its humanoid inhabitants of the coming of Earthmen, humans with advanced technology and apparently benevolent motives. The common thread is a family, beginning with Kiv peGanz Brajjyd, his daughter Sindi, and her son Norvis. Each contributes to the slow breakdown of Nidorian society, which is apparently what the Earthmen really want. Plot summary The original three stories are bracketed by narrative which lays the foundations for them and details the passage of time between them. =Introduction= Elder Grandfather Kinis peCharnok Yorgen finds himself the subject of alien abduction. Strange beings calling themselves \\"Earthmen\\" conduct him to a place above the clouds. They tell him that they have come from the Great Light to improve Nidor. Kinis peCharnok must commence building a new School of Divine Law, where the Earthmen will teach Nidorians the Law and the Scripture, not to mention science and engineering. Only the best and brightest, the fittest and most favored, will be accepted as students. =Kiv (The Chosen People)= 48 years, 3 Cycles of Nidor, pass. Kiv peGanz Brajjyd enrols at the school, on his way to the priesthood. He marries the irreverent Narla geFulda Sesom. He studies biology, especially the insect pest known as the hugl. Then a new hugl begins appearing, stripping the crops, stripping even dead animals of their flesh. The old Way of dealing with hugl, spreading Edris powder, does not work on these insects. Kiv has the answer - he knows that the hugl breed in ponds. They leave the water to gather food for the next breeding cycle, but out of the water their hard shells resist Edris powder. In water the larvae are vulnerable. Kiv tries to persuade the authorities, who are also the priesthood, to dictate a new way of using Edris, but he is up against millennia of tradition. The old Way indicates that more Edris must be used, but if it does not work there will be none to protect crops that the new hugl have not yet reached. In the end, more Edris only poisons the crops. Desperate for a solution, and with the encouragement of the Earthman known as Jones, Kiv looks for support in Scripture, and finds it. \\"Strike at the root, not at the branch\\". The larvae are the root. Having once failed to persuade a single Elder, Kiv bursts in on the entire High Council with his words. The ploy works, the new Way wipes out the hugl. But tradition has been violated. There is little or no need for Edris powder, so those who made a livelihood from it are impoverished. Kiv is a man to be reckoned with, and when he graduates his path to the Council seems clear. So why does he feel something is wrong? =Sindi (The Promised Land)= Kiv and Narla's daughter, Sindi geKiv Brajjyd, has an odd independent streak. She does not show proper deference to her elders. She too enrolls at the School, where she meets Rahn peDorvis Brajjyd. She falls in love with him, even though marriage within a clan goes against tradition and the Way of the Ancestors. Rahn's family lost its livelihood thanks to Kiv. Kiv, now high in the priesthood, tries to arrange a marriage with a member of the Yorgen clan. He is uneducated, fond of wild living, and not particularly enthusiastic about Sindi. She realizes that he is interested in someone else, a Yorgen. This relative may in fact be carrying his child, which would get them both stoned to death in an earlier time. Depressed, Rahn flees the School, pursued by Sindi. High in the mountains, in the night rains, she finds his transport, a deest, but no sign of Rahn. Then she sees him, a captive of Earthmen, on a patch of strangely flat ground with odd buildings on it. Watching from concealment, she sees the Earthman Jones, who supposedly had gone to the Great Light, never to return, take Rahn inside a building. Rahn then appears, being carried through the air by the Earthmen, who leave him by his deest. Sindi tends to Rahn, finding that he remembers nothing of his encounter with the Earthmen. They return to the School, to find that Jones' replacement, Smith, has persuaded the Elders to allow the Yorgens to marry, because of the girl's condition, clearing the way for Sindi and Rahn to marry as well. Sindi resolves to keep her secrets to herself, until it is the right time. =Norvis (False Prophet)= Norvis peRahn Brajjyd grows up and enrols in the School, as his parents and grandparents did before him. Advised by the Earthman Smith, he finds a growth hormone that doubles the yield of the staple crop, the peych-bean. Suddenly he finds himself expelled, the credit for the hormone going to a blockhead, Dran peNiblo Sesom, apparently with the connivance of Smith. Cast out by his grandfather Kiv, with no source of income, unable to speak his own name, he signs on as a sailor using the name Norvis peKrin Dmorno. His natural abilities mean that he quickly becomes indispensable, being promoted to first mate under the Captain Del peFenn Vyless, with the promise of his own ship, if he re-enlists. Del peFenn is even more irreligious than most sailors. His father used to make a lot of money from Edris powder shipments, before the Elder Kiv peGanz Brajjyd eliminated the need for it. All too aware of what Del peFenn would think of Kiv's grandson, Norvis declines. He goes ashore to find that some of the Elders have been using his hormone to favor their own farms at the expense of others. He organizes a meeting, under his real name, to address impoverished farmers. However, in attacking the Elders he is accused of blasphemy and stoned, barely escaping with his life by swimming a lake. His assailants assume he has drowned. Norvis abandons his old identity as too dangerous. Returning to Del peFenn, he formulates a plan. He will make hormone more cheaply than the Elders can and sell it to the farmers. The plan backfires when a glut of peych starts an economic depression. In the ensuing troubles, Del's ship is burned and some of his men are killed. The hapless Dran peNiblo Sesom, who had grown rich making and selling the hormone under the protection of the Elders, is lynched by a mob. Norvis is not finished. He and Del now take on the Elders to stop the use of the hormone and persuade farmers to plough the excess crop into the ground, as fertilizer. To do this, they form the Merchant's Party, the first political party on Nidor. Through agitation and occasional strongarm tactics, they force the Elders to follow their plan, ignoring tradition. At the end, Norvis is the Secretary of the new party. Del is its charismatic, anti-priesthood leader. Nidorians who have suffered in the troubles flock to them. They have become a new authority on Nidor. Norvis sees a new dawn, and a way to get rid of the Earthmen and all their works. Starting with Smith ... The saga continues in The Dawning Light. Reception Damon Knight wryly dismissed the novel as badly plotted, saying that the planetary ecology \\"seems to be made up entirely of peych beans, hugl bugs, and simpletons.\\"\\"In The Balance\\", If, December 1958, p.114 Galaxy columnist Floyd C.

He was one of three sons of Alfred Cartier (1841–1925) and Amélie Alice (née Griffeuille) Cartier (1853–1914). His two brothers were Pierre Cartier and Louis Cartier. His grandfather, Louis- François Cartier had taken over the jewellery workshop of his teacher, Adolphe Picard, in 1847, thereby founding the famous Cartier jewelry company. Cartier graduated from Collège Stanislas de Paris. Career Jacques worked with his two older brothers to create the world-famous name and business, 'Cartier', in jewellery and watches. While Jacques opened and managed the store in London, Pierre managed the store in New York City. Jacques took charge of the London operation of Cartier in 1909 and eventually moved to the current location at 175 New Bond Street. Meanwhile, Louis was the designer who created the Cartier style known today. The brothers divided and conquered. Cartier was very lucky in getting the recommendation of Princess Mathilde, the young cousin of Napoleon III, and this contributed to the boosting business. In the early 1900s, \\"Cartier became jewellers to the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, the Fords, the Morgans, King Edward VII, King Zog of Albania, and King Chulalongkorn of Siam, who, in 1907 alone, according to Cartier biographer Hans Nadelhoffer, bought Cartier bracelets to the value of $450,000.\\" Through their continued successes, Louis and Pierre got married, while Jacques kept himself busy by fulfilling royal needs and desires and trips abroad in search of unique and exceptional beauty in gems. Jacques went to the Persian Gulf to find the perfect pearl. Jacques then proceeded to India, carrying magnificent jewellery of local maharajahs back to the London studio to redesign and modify for their own use. Together, Pierre and Jacques purchased a large number of pearls and precious stones from an Indian prince. The uniqueness of the pearls and stones created a sense of each piece of jewellery being special, which helped with the success of their business. Jacques ran the London store until his death in 1941. His brother Louis died the following year in July 1942. The Cartier family of jewellers relinquished control of the family business in 1964 due to the passing of Pierre. Personal life In 1912, Cartier was married to Anna Margaretha \\"Nelly\\" (née Harjes) Gardiner (1878–1972). Nelly, who was divorced from Lion W. Gardiner of Gardiner's Island, was the mother of Mary Dorothy Gardiner (wife of Victor Louis Marie Jean Dupont) and the sister of banker Henry Herman Harjes, a partner of J.P. Morgan in France. Together, they were the parents of four children: * Jacqueline Elma Cartier (b. 1913), who married the America, Sylvester Gardiner Prime of Shelter Island (a descendants of Nathaniel Prime), in 1939. * Alice Cartier (b. 1915), who married Carl Nater, son of the mayor of St. Moritz, in 1945. * Jean-Jacques Cartier (1920–2010), who married Lydia Baels (1920–1990), a daughter of Henri Baels. Lydia's sister, Lilian, Princess of Réthy was the wife of King Leopold III of Belgium. * Alfred Harjes Cartier (1922–1974), who married Elizabeth Conn (1911–1976) in 1945.

The probe is designed to bring the air to rest relative to the aircraft. As the air is brought to rest, kinetic energy is converted to internal energy. The air is compressed and experiences an adiabatic increase in temperature. Therefore, total air temperature is higher than the static (or ambient) air temperature. Total air temperature is an essential input to an air data computer in order to enable computation of static air temperature and hence true airspeed. The relationship between static and total air temperatures is given by: : \\\\frac{T_\\\\mathrm{total}}{T_{s}}={1+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma -1}{2}M_a^2} where: :T_{s}= static air temperature, SAT (kelvins or degrees Rankine) :T_\\\\mathrm{total}= total air temperature, TAT (kelvins or degrees Rankine) :M_{a}= Mach number :\\\\gamma\\\\ =\\\\, ratio of specific heats, approx 1.400 for dry air In practice, the total air temperature probe will not perfectly recover the energy of the airflow, and the temperature rise may not be entirely due to adiabatic process. In this case, an empirical recovery factor (less than 1) may be introduced to compensate: (1) : \\\\frac{T_\\\\mathrm{total}}{T_{s}}={1+\\\\frac{\\\\gamma -1}{2}eM_a^2} Where: :e = recovery factor (also noted Ct) Typical recovery factors Platinum wire ratiometer thermometer (\\"flush bulb type\\"): e ≈ 0.75 - 0.9 Double platinum tube ratiometer thermometer (\\"TAT probe\\"): e ≈ 1 Other notations Total air temperature (TAT) is also called: indicated air temperature (IAT) or ram air temperature (RAT) Static air temperature (SAT) is also called: outside air temperature (OAT) or true air temperature  Ram rise  The difference between TAT and SAT is called ram rise (RR) and is caused by compressibility and friction of the air at high velocities. (2) :RR_\\\\mathrm{total}=TAT-SAT \\\\, In practice the ram rise is negligible for aircraft flying at (true) airspeeds under Mach 0.2 For airspeeds (TAS) over Mach 0.2, as airspeed increases the temperature exceeds that of still air. This is caused by a combination of kinetic (friction) heating and adiabatic compression *Kinetic heating. As the airspeed increases, more and more molecules of air per second hit the aircraft. This causes a temperature rise in the Direct Reading thermometer probe of the aircraft due to friction. Because the airflow is thought to be compressible and isentropic, which, by definition, is adiabatic and reversible, the equations used in this article do not take account of friction heating. This is why the calculation of static air temperature requires the use of the recovery factor, {e} . Kinetic heating for modern passenger jets is almost negligible. *Adiabatic compression. As described above, this is caused by a conversion of energy and not by direct application of heat. At airspeeds over Mach 0.2, in the Remote Reading temperature probe (TAT-probe), the outside airflow, which may be several hundred knots, is brought virtually to rest very rapidly. The energy (Specific Kinetic Energy) of the moving air is then released (converted) in the form of a temperature rise (Specific Enthalpy). Energy cannot be destroyed but only transformed; this means that according to the first law of thermodynamics, the total energy of an isolated system must remain constant. The total of kinetic heating and adiabatic temperature change (caused by adiabatic compression) is the Total Ram Rise. Combining equations (1) & (2), we get: : RR_\\\\mathrm{total}={T_s\\\\frac{\\\\gamma -1}{2}eM_a^2} If we use the Mach number equation for dry air: : M_a={\\\\frac{V}{a}} where a={\\\\sqrt{\\\\gamma R_{sp} T_s}} we get (3) : RR_\\\\mathrm{total}={e V^2 \\\\frac{\\\\gamma -1}{\\\\gamma2R_{sp} }} Which can be simplified to: : RR_{total} = {\\\\frac{V^2}{2 C_p}} e by using R_{sp} = { C_p - C_v } and : \\\\gamma = {\\\\frac{ C_p}{C_v}} : a = local speed of sound. : \\\\gamma = adiabatic index (ratio of heat capacities) and is assumed for aviation purposes to be 7/5 = 1.400. : R_{sp} = specific gas constant. The approximate value of R_{sp} for dry air is 286.9 J·kg−1·K−1. : C_p = heat capacity constant for constant pressure. : C_v = heat capacity constant for constant volume. : T_s = static air temperature, SAT, measured in kelvins. : V = true airspeed of the aircraft, TAS. : e = recovery factor, which has an approximate value of 0.98, typical for a modern TAT-probe.

Several theories and movements of Pan-Asianism have been proposed, specifically from East, South and Southeast Asia. Motivating the movement has been resistance to Western imperialism and colonialism and a belief that \\"Asian values\\" should take precedence over \\"European values\\". Japanese Asianism Greater East Asia Conference in November 1943, the participants were (L–R): Ba Maw, Zhang Jinghui, Wang Jingwei, Hideki Tōjō, Wan Waithayakon, José P. Laurel, Subhas Chandra Bose Pre-World War II Japanese Pan-Asianism was, at its core, the idea that Asia should unite against European imperialism. Japanese Asianism developed in intertwining among debates on solidarity with Asian nations who were under pressure of Europe and on aggressive expansion to the Asian continent. The former debates originated from liberalism. Their ideologues were Tokichi Tarui (1850–1922) who argued for equal Japan-Korea unionization for cooperative defence against the European powers,Tarui, Tokichi (1893) Daito Gappo-ron and Kentaro Oi (1843–1922) who attempted domestic constitutional government in Japan and reforms of Korea.See Osaka Incident of 1885. Pan-Asian thought in Japan began to develop in the late 19th century and was spurred on particularly following the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905). This created interest from Indian poets Rabindranath Tagore and Sri Aurobindo and Chinese politician Sun Yat-sen. A Japanese Pan-Asian writer Shūmei Ōkawa. The growing official interest in broader Asian concerns was shown in the establishment of facilities for Indian Studies. In 1899, Tokyo Imperial University set up a chair in Sanskrit and Kawi, with a further chair in comparative religion being set up in 1903. In this environment, a number of Indian students came to Japan in the early twentieth century, founding the Oriental Youngmen's Association in 1900. Their anti-British political activity caused consternation to the Indian Government, following a report in the London Spectator. However, Japanese society had been strongly inclined to ultranationalism from the Freedom and People's Rights Movement. The latter debates on aggressive expansionism to Asia became clearly apparent. Their representatives were the Black Ocean Society and the Black Dragon Society. The Black Dragon Society (1933) argued for Japanese imperialism and expansionism, and they led to a debate on securing the Asian continent under Japanese control. Exceptionally, Ryōhei Uchida (1874–1937), who was a member of the Black Dragon Society, was a Japan-Korea unionist and activist of Philippines and Chinese revolutions. Tōten Miyazaki (1870–1922) consistently supported a Chinese revolution of Sun Yat-sen with spiritual sacrifice and sympathy under imperial Japan. Okakura Kakuzō (1862–1913) criticized European imperialism as a destroyer of human beauty, and argued for romantic solidarity with diverse \\"Asia as one\\" against European civilization. > ASIA is one. The Himalayas divide, only to accentuate, two mighty > civilisations, the Chinese with its communism of Confucius, and the Indian > with its individualism of the Vedas. But not even the snowy barriers can > interrupt for one moment that broad expanse of love for the Ultimate and > Universal, which is the common thought-inheritance of every Asiatic race, > enabling them to produce all the great religions of the world, and > distinguishing them from those maritime peoples of the Mediterranean and the > Baltic, who love to dwell on the Particular, and to search out the means, > not the end, of life.Okakura, Tenshin (1904) Ideal of the East In this Okakura was utilising the Japanese concept of sangoku, which existed in Japanese culture before the concept of Asia became popularised. Sangoku literally means the \\"three countries\\": Honshu (the largest island of Japan), Kara (China) and Tenjiku (India). However, most Pan-Asianists were nationalistic and imperialistic and were connected with rightist organizations. They discussed self-righteous solidarity which led to ideology such as a \\"new order\\" of East Asia and \\"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\\" based on Japanese supremacy. New Greater Asianism from China From a Chinese perspective, Japanese Asianism was interpreted as a rationalized ideology for Japanese military aggression and political absorption (cf. Twenty-One Demands). In 1917, Li Dazhao (1889–1927) argued for the liberation of Asian nations and equal greater Asian union. In 1924, Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925) stated that the West was hegemonic and the East was Confucian, and he argued for full independence by resisting colonialism with \\"Greater Asianism\\" which unified Asian nations.1924 speech on Greater Asianism Pan- Asianism post World War II Political leaders from Sun Yat-sen in the 1910s and 20s to Mahathir Mohamad in the 1990s argue that the political models and ideologies of Europe lack values and concepts found in Asian societies and philosophies. European values such as individual rights and freedoms would not be suited for Asian societies in this extreme formulation of Pan-Asianism. The idea of \\"Asian values\\" is somewhat of a resurgence of Pan-Asianism. One foremost enthusiast of the idea was the former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. In India, Rammanohar Lohia dreamed of a united socialist Asia.

It is separated from the cochlear duct by the basilar membrane, and it extends from the round window to the helicotrema, where it continues as vestibular duct. The purpose of the perilymph-filled tympanic duct and vestibular duct is to transduce the movement of air that causes the tympanic membrane and the ossicles to vibrate, to movement of liquid and the basilar membrane. This movement is conveyed to the organ of Corti inside the cochlear duct, composed of hair cells attached to the basilar membrane and their stereocilia embedded in the tectorial membrane. The movement of the basilar membrane compared to the tectorial membrane causes the stereocilia to bend. They then depolarise and send impulses to the brain via the cochlear nerve. This produces the sensation of sound. Additional images File:Gray921.pngInterior of right osseous labyrinth. (Scala tympani labeled at right, inside cochlea.

Constructed in the late 19th century, the facility advertises itself as having the world's largest porch. The Grand Hotel is well known for a number of notable visitors, including five U.S. presidents, inventor Thomas Edison, and author Mark Twain. Grand Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. History In 1886, the Michigan Central Railroad, Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and Detroit and Cleveland Steamship Navigation Company formed the Mackinac Island Hotel Company. The group purchased the land on which the hotel was built and construction began, based upon the design by Detroit architects Mason and Rice. When it opened the following year, the hotel was advertised to Chicago, Erie, Montreal and Detroit residents as a summer retreat for vacationers who arrived by lake steamer and by rail from across the continent. The hotel opened on July 10, 1887 and took a mere 93 days to complete. At its opening, nightly rates at the hotel ranged from $3 to $5 a night (equivalent to $– in ). In 1957, the Grand Hotel was designated a State Historic Building. In 1972, the hotel was named to the National Register of Historic Places, and on June 29, 1989, the hotel was made a National Historic Landmark. In September 2019, Dan Musser III announced that his family, which owned the hotel \\"for nearly nine decades\\", is selling it to KSL Capital Partners. Facilities A catamaran used to transport people to and from the island Grand Hotel, Michigan, summer 1990 Carleton Varney, a protégé of Dorothy Draper, designed the Grand Hotel in its late 19th-century decor, including Pelargonium geraniums. Varney purposely designed the hotel so that all the rooms are different from each other in at least one aspect. There are four types of rooms: Category I, Category II, Category III, and Named Rooms. There are six two-bedroom suites consisting of two bedrooms connected by a parlor, of which two, the Grand Suite and the Carleton Varney Suite, overlook the Mackinac Bridge and the Straits of Mackinac. The presidential suite is located in the center of the hotel with a balcony over the porch. A detached structure added in early 2000 was named the Masco Cottage. Additionally, seven suites are named for and designed by seven former First Ladies of the United States. These are the Jacqueline Kennedy Suite (with carpet that includes the gold presidential eagle on a navy blue background and walls painted gold), Lady Bird Johnson Suite (yellow damask-covered walls with blue and gold wildflowers), Betty Ford Suite (green with cream and a dash of red), Rosalynn Carter Suite (with a sample of china designed for the Carter White House and wall coverings in Georgia peach), Nancy Reagan Suite (with signature red walls and Mrs. Reagan's personal touches), Barbara Bush Suite (designed with pale blue and pearl and with both Maine and Texas influences), and the Laura Bush Suite (decorated with bright cream and floral patterns inspired by the Texas prairie). Grand Hotel's front porch is the longest in the world at some in length, overlooking a vast Tea Garden and the resort-scale Esther Williams swimming pool. These areas are often used by guests on a casual family vacation, for large conventions, or concerts during the hotel's annual Labor Day Jazz Festival. The hotel has drawn some criticism for its policy of charging a $10 fee for non-guests to enter the building and enjoy the view from the famous porch. docks to the hotel via horse-drawn carriage. Before 2007, air conditioning was only available in public rooms, such as the lobby, parlor and Salle a Manger (main dining room). Due to the building's design it was difficult to add air conditioning to the guest rooms. That year, the entire hotel became air conditioned after 170 guest rooms were installed with heat exchangers which cool the air through contact with the bathroom cold water system. Mackinac Island does not permit motor vehicles (except for emergency vehicles and, in winter, snowmobiles), and transport to and from the dock to the hotel is via horse-drawn carriage. The only other motor vehicles allowed in recent history were cars brought over for the filming of Somewhere in Time. During the winter months, when ice prevents ferry transport from the mainland, the hotel is closed. The island also has a small airport (no fuel or services) for private aircraft. The horse-drawn taxis will take guests from the airport to the hotel or any other destination. Notable events President Gerald Ford golfing on the \\"Grand\\" (front) nine of Grand Hotel's golf course, The Jewel, on July 13, 1975 U.S. Presidents Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton have visited the hotel. The hotel also hosted the first public demonstration of Thomas Edison's phonograph on the porch, as well as regular demonstrations of Edison's other new inventions. Mark Twain also made this a regular location on his speaking tours in the Midwest. In May each year, the Grand Hotel serves as the headquarters for the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce's Mackinac Policy Conference that attracts politicians, businessmen and labor leaders from across the state and the northern Midwest region. Acclaim Conde Nast Traveler \\"Gold Lists\\" the hotel as one of the \\"Best Places to Stay in the Whole World\\" and Travel + Leisure magazine's lists it as among the \\"Top 100 Hotels in the World.\\" The Wine Spectator noted the Grand Hotel with an \\"Award of Excellence\\" and it was included in Gourmet magazine's \\"Top 25 Hotels in the World\\" list. The American Automobile Association (AAA) rates the facilities as a four-diamond resort. and in 2009 named the Grand Hotel one of the top 10 U.S. historic hotels. In popular culture The Grand Hotel served as a backdrop and one of the settings for the 1980 film Somewhere in Time starring Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour. Every October the hotel hosts an annual convention for fans of the cult classic. The hotel also served as the setting for the 1947 musical comedy This Time for Keeps starring Jimmy Durante and Esther Williams (after whom the hotel's swimming pool is named). The hotel was the origin of the first World Sauntering Day in the 1970s.

It developed in the 17th century from caïques which were used elsewhere in the Mediterranean. In the past, kajjikki were equipped with sails and oars, but today the fishing boats are powered by inboard motors. Variants of the boat participate in the rowing regattas held twice every year. History The kajjik developed in the 17th century from the caïques which accompanied galleys of the navy of the Order of Saint John. The boats were usually used as fishing boats, but some were also used to carry passengers. Variants of the kajjik included the kajjik tal-kopp and the kajjik tal-lampara. The latter had a light source attached to the bow which allowed fishing at night. Another variant was the kajjik tal-gangmu, which had a low bow and a short forestem originally intended for fishing for seashells. This was also used to recover coal which had fallen to the seabed while being loaded onto ships in the Grand Harbour. The flat stern of a kajjik as opposed to the double-ended hull of the luzzu From about 1920, inboard motors were installed on some kajjikki which were used for fishing. Today, the boats are no longer being built and they are on the decline. However, many examples still exist and remain in use as fishing boats, particularly at St. Paul's Bay and Marsaxlokk. Description The kajjik bears similarities to the dgħajsa tal-pass, but it is of stronger construction and it has a flat stern. The boats were originally equipped with both oars and sails. They would have a single mast rigged with a spritsail. Today they are propelled by engines. Regatta variants A Kalkara kajjik at the regatta of 8 September 2008 Variants of the kajjik are commonly used in the rowing regattas held in the Grand Harbour on 31 March and 8 September each year. They have been participating in the September regatta since 1822. Initially, kajjikki tal- kopp were used in the races, but purpose-built versions of the boats were introduced later. The kajjik used in the modern regatta has two oars, and it is manned by a crew of two, one standing and one seated. It is long, has a beam of and a depth of . Variants of other traditional boats, the dgħajsa and frejgatina, also compete in the regatta.

Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Thompson was not selected in the 2005 NFL Draft due to concerns about his lack of experience at the Division I level. He impressed the Cowboys with his speed during a tryout at Valley Ranch and was eventually signed as an undrafted free agent to compete for the reserve running back and kick returner positions. After making the team, although he was third on the running back depth chart (behind Julius Jones and Marion Barber), a Jones injury allowed him to rush 20 times for 75 yards against the Philadelphia Eagles and was named NFL Rookie of the Week (Week 5). He finished the season with team records for kickoff returns (57) and kickoff return yardage (1,399) while ranking ninth in the NFL with a 24.5-yard average. His 2006 season ended when he broke his left ankle in the seventh game against the Carolina Panthers, after being tackled out of bounds on a kickoff return. In 2007, he was declared inactive in 9 games and was not re- signed at the end of the year, after losing his returner job to Miles Austin. =Las Vegas Locomotives (UFL)= In 2009, Thompson was selected in the UFL Premiere Season Draft by the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.

(today Olympus Corporation) in Japan, and sold as OM-4 from 1983 to 1987 and as OM-4Ti from 1986 to 2002. The OM-4 was the successor to the OM-2N and represented the highest evolution of the Olympus OM-series SLRs (introduced in 1972). Other Olympus OM top models were the OM-1, OM-2, OM-1N, OM-2N, OM-2 Spot Program, OM-3 and OM-3Ti. They all used the same body configuration, but with developing aluminum alloy chassis, electronics, feature levels, and external controls and cosmetics.  Features  Frontal view of an OM-4 camera body, without lens attached Top view of an OM-4 camera body, showing controls The OM-4 used a horizontal cloth focal plane shutter with a manual speed range of one second - 1/2000 second (up to 240 seconds was possible in automatic mode), plus bulb and flash X-sync of 1/60 second. Unlike most SLRs of the era, the OM-4 used a familiar OM-series shutter-speed ring, concentric with the lens mount, instead of a top-mounted shutter speed dial. The OM-4 accepted all Olympus-made OM bayonet-mount lenses, which were marketed under the Zuiko brand name. The OM-4 was a battery-dependent (requiring two 1.5-volt silver oxide SR44, V76, 357 cells - use of a 3-volt 1/3N lithium cell is not recommended) electro-mechanically controlled manual-focus SLR with manual exposure control or aperture-priority auto-exposure. The OM-4 was the first camera with a built-in multi-spot exposure meter (2% of view; 3.3˚ with 50 mm lens) which could take up to eight spot measurements and average them. Another unique feature was the selectable option to assess the darkest or brightest part of the scene, the camera adjusting the exposure based on that measure. The light meter used a dual-concentric segmented silicon photodiode to provide spot or center-weighted readings. It used a graduated, linear LCD shutter speed display at the bottom of the viewfinder to precisely indicate its readings versus the actual camera settings. The major improvements of the OM-4 compared to the OM-2N were the stronger chassis, gasket weatherproofing, permanently affixed, dedicated hot shoe and TTL flash cable connector, linear liquid crystal display (LCD) shutter speed display, provision for spot- metering, and flexible integrated-circuit electronics. Accessories for the OM-4 included all the Olympus motor drives made for the OM-System cameras. Motor Drive 2 was introduced with the OM-4 and, in addition to automatic film advance (up to 5 frames per second), featured motorized film rewind. The camera accepted the Olympus 250-exposure bulk film back (10 meters of film = 250 frames) and the Olympus T-system flashes. The T45 handle-mount electronic flash (guide number 148/45 (feet/meters) at ASA/ISO 100) was also introduced with the OM-4. The original OM-4 was available in only one color: all black. The introductory US list price for the body only (no lens) was $685. Note that SLRs usually sold for 30 to 40 percent below list price. The camera dimensions are 87 mm height, 139 mm width, 50 mm depth and weight.  Design history  The Olympus OM-series SLRs were influential in SLR design changes in the 1970s and 1980s, with intense competition between the major SLR brands: Olympus, Nikon, Canon, Minolta and Pentax. Between about 1975 and 1985, there was a dramatic shift away from heavy all-metal manual mechanical camera bodies to much more compact bodies with integrated-circuit (IC) electronic automation. In addition, because of rapid advances in electronics, the brands continually leapfrogged each other as they brought out models with new or automated features. The OM-1 introduced the compact body size that inspired similar sized SLRs of competing manufacturers (Pentax M series, Nikon FE/FM). Through- the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash control was pioneered by the OM-2 in 1975. The OM-4 and its mechanically controlled companion the OM-3 were quite conservative designs, despite their very sophisticated spot-meters. They can be described as the OM-2 and OM-1 with electronic spot-meter controls grafted on. The OM-4's deliberately limited, but tightly focused, features were not intended to appeal to beginners. Instead of offering every possible automated 'bell and whistle', the OM-4's manual spot-metering represented Olympus's intention to provide precision for the professional and advanced amateur photographer. In 1986, a special ultra-durable version of the OM-4 with champagne-colored titanium top and bottom plates, upgraded electronic circuitry and improved weatherproofing, called the OM-4Ti (OM-4T in the USA), was released, with a US list price of $770. The OM-4Ti also introduced a new electronic flash-control system. Normally focal-plane shutters are limited in their maximum flash synchronization speed, because of the way they provide fast shutter speeds – timing the second shutter curtain to close more quickly after the first shutter curtain opens. This causes a narrowing of the slit \\"wiping\\" the exposure on the film. In effect, a horizontal focal-plane shutter made of cloth is only fully open and usable for flash exposure up to 1/60s. Any faster and a typical one-millisecond flash burst would only partially expose the film - the part open to the slit. The OM-4Ti overcame this problem by having the new Olympus F280 Full Synchro flash pulse its light continuously over 40 milliseconds, long enough to illuminate the slit as it crossed the entire focal plane, even at shutter speeds as fast as 1/2000s. There is, however, a concomitant loss of flash range. A black-finished version of the OM-4T came out in 1990, listing for $1250 (the natural finished body remained available for $1200). In the US market the OM-4T was renamed OM-4Ti in 1997 ($1819 list), without any feature changes, before being discontinued in 2002. Olympus failed to make the transition to autofocus (AF) 35 mm SLRs in the wake of the introduction of the landmark Minolta Maxxum 7000 in 1985. Most manual- focus SLRs disappeared by 1989. The OM-4 and OM-3 models were retained because Olympus had no appropriate successors. Their rugged construction also appealed to professional photographers, and some traditionalist amateurs who preferred manual-focus cameras. The Olympus OM-4 sold steadily to Olympus enthusiasts, but more and more slowly over its lifetime, as it became increasingly outdated. It remained in limited production until 2002, when the rise of digital SLRs gave Olympus an opportunity to get back into the SLR camera business with its Four Thirds System. The OM-4 is tough and reliable, and regarded as one of the finest SLRs of its generation.  References  *Anonymous. \\"Modern Photography's Annual Guide '84: 48 Top Cameras: Olympus OM-4\\" p 86.

She competed for Nazi Germany in Berlin, despite having been forced to leave Germany in 1935 and resettle in the United States because she was Jewish. Mayer had been called the greatest female fencer of all time, and was named by Sports Illustrated as one of the Top 100 Female Athletes of the 20th Century, but her legacy remains clouded. At the Olympics in Berlin, where she was the only German athlete of Jewish origin to win a medal, she gave the Nazi salute during the medal ceremony, and later said it might have protected her family that was still in Germany, in labor camps. Some consider her a traitor and opportunist, while others consider her a tragic figure who was used not only by Nazi Germany but by the International Olympic Committee and the United States Olympic Committee to prevent a boycott of the Games. After the Olympics, she returned to the United States and became a nine-time U.S. champion. She received citizenship in 1941 but returned to Germany in 1952. Mayer died the following year, leaving few interviews and little correspondence. Family and early life Mayer was born in Offenbach am Main, a suburb of Frankfurt. Her mother lda Anna Bertha (née Becker) was Lutheran, and her father Ludwig Karl Mayer, a physician, was Jewish and was born in 1876. Emmanuel Mayer, her paternal great-grandfather, and Jule Weissman, his wife, were the parents of Martin Mayer, her paternal grandfather who was born in 1841 and who married Rosalie Hamburg, her paternal grandmother. Mayer was the subject of the book Foiled: Hitler's Jewish Olympian: the Helene Mayer Story (RDR Books, 2002), which focused on how \\"the Nazis brought Mayer home from self-imposed exile in California to be the token Jew on their team.\\" Her birth certificate listed her as \\"Israelitischen\\"; as Jewish. As a child, she was called the \\"Jewish Mayer,\\" to distinguish her from the \\"Christian Mayer\\", a child who lived next door to her, as was reported by the press of the time. In January 1933, the Offenbach Fencing Club rescinded her membership on the basis of new Nazi legislation banning Jews. Her religious identity reportedly did not become an issue until Adolf Hitler rose to power in the 1930s. Fencing career West German stamp from 1968 featuring Mayer Mayer was only 13 when she won the German women's foil championship in 1924. Her technique and talent were spectacular, according to fencing experts who have seen footage of her fencing. By 1930, she had won six German championships.Fechten - Deutsche Meisterschaften. sport-komplett.de =Olympics= Mayer won a gold medal in fencing at the age of 17 at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, representing Germany, winning 18 bouts and losing only 2. She became a national hero in Germany and was celebrated, with her photo plastered everyone. According to a profile in The Guardian, \\"She was tall, blonde, elegant and vivacious.\\" In 1931, her father died of a heart attack. She finished fifth at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, having learned, two hours prior to the match, that her boyfriend had died in a military training exercise in Germany. She then remained in the U.S. to study for two years as an exchange student at Scripps College, earning a certificate in social work in 1934. She later studied towards a master's degree at the University of California at Berkeley, and fenced for the USC Fencing Club. She hoped to join the German diplomatic corps. After Hitler came to power in 1933, anti-Jewish laws put in place nearly ended her career. Her membership at her German fencing club was terminated, as was her study exchange. She found work teaching German at Mills College in Oakland, California, and later taught at San Francisco City College. She was stripped of her citizenship in Germany in 1935 by the Nuremberg Laws, which considered her non-German. She accepted an invitation to compete for Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. Goebbels required of the press that \\"no comments may be made regarding Helene Mayer's non-Aryan ancestry\\". She won a silver medal in individual women's foil. She gave a Nazi salute on the podium, and later said it might have protected her family that was still in Germany, in labor camps. =International competitions= In 1928 she won the Italian national championship. She was the European champion in 1929 and 1931. She was World Foil Champion in 1929–31 and 1937. =US Championships= Ultimately, she settled in the United States and had a successful fencing career, winning the US women's foil championship 8 times from 1934–1946 (1934, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1941, 1942, and 1946). Return to Germany and death In 1952, Mayer returned to Germany, where she married an old friend, Erwin Falkner von Sonnenburg, in a quiet May ceremony in Munich. The couple moved to the hills above Stuttgart before setting in Heidelberg where she died of breast cancer in October 1953, two months before her 43rd birthday. Legacy Mayer was named one of the top 100 female athletes of the 20th century by Sports Illustrated. She was inducted into the USFA Hall of Fame in 1963.

It was the family's subsequent move to the town of Hornostaypil, from which his appellation, \\"the Steipler\\", was later derived. Around the age of 11 Kanievsky entered the Novardok Yeshiva in Navahrudak, studying under its famed rosh yeshiva, Rabbi Yosef Yoizel Horowitz. By age 19, having progressed rapidly and gained a reputation as a talmid chacham, he was recommended by Rabbi Horowitz \\"to head a yeshiva in Rogatshov\\" \\\\- as a branch of Horowitz's yeshiva. Army service The Bolshevik Revolution was in full swing, and Kanievsky was conscripted into the Red Army. In spite of the harsh conditions, he continued to strictly observe all the mitzvos. Once, during his stint, Kanievsky was court-martialled for \\"failing to do his duty\\" when there was a possibility of breaking the Sabbath. He was forced to walk between two rows of soldiers who were ordered to beat him as he passed. In later years, Kanievsky remarked that the satisfaction he had enjoyed for making a stand for his religious convictions was an achievement never again equaled for the rest of his life; earlier he had insisted on wearing a summer uniform in the winter since there was a problem of shatnez . =Later years= After serving under arms for some time, Kanievsky managed to get discharged. He decided to move to Białystok in Poland, in order to continue learning Torah unhindered from Communist interference. There, he studied under Rabbi Avraham Yoffen. In 1922 (1925), Kanievsky published his first sefer (\\"book\\"), Sha'arei Tevunah (\\"gates of understanding\\"). This was received with great acclaim, and the work eventually reached Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz (known as the Chazon Ish) in Vilna. Without even meeting him, Rabbi Karelitz decided that the author of such a work was worthy of marrying his sister Miriam. Their father was Rabbi Shmaryahu Yosef Karelitz (1852 - 1916) the rabbi of Kosova (now Belarus)\\"Invitation to the Wedding of the Steipler with the Sister of the Chazon Ish\\". Kedem Auction House website for thirty-four years, the father of the Karelitz family, which brought together prominent rabbis and Torah scholars. Kanievsky was then appointed rosh yeshiva of the Novarodok yeshiva in Pinsk. He read each Shabbos from the V'Higadeta series, authored by his friend from Novardok yeshivah, Yaakov Galinsky. The Land of Israel Rabbi Kanievsky is notable for having never left Israel for even a brief visit abroad since his arrival. In 1934, at the urging of his brother-in-law, the Chazon Ish, he left Poland and moved to Israel, settling in Bnei BrakRabbi Zacharia Fishman, \\"צום אפפאר קיין ארץ־ישראל פון דעם ר\\"מ בּישיבת פינסק\\" (news of his immigration to Bnei Brak, Israel in a local Jewish newspaper in Pinsk), Pinsker Vort, February 23, 1934., where his brother-in-law, Rabbi Karelitz, had already been living for about eight months. Immediately upon his arrival he was appointed Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Beis Yosef - Novardok in Bnei brak (the first Yeshiva Gedolah in Bnei Brak and one of the oldest yeshivas in the new settlement in the 20th century). For many years, he was head of two yeshivas there. Rabbi Kanievsky referred to the Chazon Ish as his \\"rabbi and mentor,\\" who in his final years lived with the Kanievsky family, where Rebbetzin Miriam ran the communal household. Alongside Rabbi Elazar Shach, Rabbi Kanievsky was considered the spiritual leader of the Lithuanian ultra- Orthodox community. Though known as a world-class scholar, he shunned publicity, and lived in humble surroundings, teaching, writing, and devoting himself to Torah and good deeds. He was one of the presidents of Kollel Chazon Ish and a member of the Asra Kadisha organization. The Steipler was high-level hearing-impaired and therefore those who turned to him would write their question or request and he would reply and bless them after reading the script. In his last decades, after the Beit Yosef Yeshiva was closed, he performed a yearly shiur at the Kollel Chazon Ish on the death anniversary of the Chazon Ish, with the participation of a large public. He died on Friday night, 23rd of Menachem Av, 5745 (1985), with over 150,000 mourners attending his funeral. He was buried in the Shomrei Shabbos cemetery in Bnei Brak, near the tomb of the Chazon Ish. His son, Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, following in his father's path, is a world-renowned Haredi rabbinical authority. He also has a daughter who currently lives in Bnei Brak. A memorial plaque for Rabbi Ya'akov Kanievski on Rashbam Street in Bnei Brak Political involvement The Steipler strongly criticized the Poalei Agudat Yisrael party, calling it \\"of the parties who damage in the vineyard of the House of the Lord\\", and added: \\"When we be granted the salvation, this party will be on the side of those who ruin and destroy religion.\\"\\"השקפתנו\\" (Our Perspective) Part C: Chapter 6: Letter of Nisan 5732-1972. On the leaders of the party he wrote that they \\"corrupted and turned it into a distinct-materialistic party ... and they put venom of \\"אשר קרך\\" into their ranks,\\" and on its voters he wrote that they \\"violate the name of God in secret and in multitude\\"\\"Our Perspective\\" Part I, Chapter: The PAI Movement: A Letter from Av 5721-1961. In the 1984 elections, he joined Rabbi Shach's view and announced, \\"My family and I will vote Shas.\\" This was the beginning of the process that led to the split of Agudat Yisrael and the establishment of Degel HaTorah prior to the 1989 elections. Commemoration The \\"Kehilot Yaakov Street\\" in the \\"Merkaz Baalei Melacha\\" neighborhood of Bnei Brak was named after him, after his demise, and the neighborhood was also renamed to \\"Kehilot Yaakov\\". The Lithuanian community in this neighborhood is called \\"Mishkenot Ya'akov\\" after him. In addition, the Yeshivat Kehilot Yaakov was established in his name, which was located in Hazon Yehezkel and moved to Modi'in Illit, as well as Yeshivat Tifereth Yisrael in the Givat Shaul neighborhood of Jerusalem. The name of the \\"Derech Emet\\" Talmud Torah in Petach Tikvah was changed to \\"Birchas Yaakov\\" after him and the Talmud Torah network Tiferet Yaakov in Bnei Brak and Jerusalem is named after him. Works The Steipler wrote many works, his magnum opus being the multi-volume Kehillos Yaakov (\\"assembly of Jacob\\"), containing his unique analysis of most of the tractates and concepts of the Talmud; one volume he composed while in the army. He also authored Birkas Peretz (on the Torah) and Chayei Olam. There are several volumes of letters, known as Karyana D'Igarta, and several volumes written by a disciple, Rabbi A Horowitz, describe his daily life. These are known as Orchos Rabbeinu.

Permission is usually granted through a Royal Charter. The charter normally confers a constitution with perpetual succession and the right to sue or be sued independently of the members. The charter also usually provide for rights of recourse to the Queen in Council. Although incorporation is now cheaply and easily obtainable by registration, the distinction of a Royal Charter means that such charters are still sought by and granted to institutions considered to be in the public interest, typically learned professional societies. Although many institutions are formally Royal Colleges, such as the three royal public schools of Westminster, Winchester and Eton, the phrase \\"The Royal Colleges\\" is commonly applied to the medical institutions, such as the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow and the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of Nursing and similar institutions in Australia, Canada, and elsewhere.

After working as a bicycle messenger, his journalistic career started in 1994 with the UK magazine MTB Pro, on which he worked for five years. After the magazine was closed down by its publishers, Future Publishing, who said that there was not enough interest in a magazine about the 'soul' of mountain biking, he left the company and went freelance, contributing to Mountain Biking UK, Total Bike, Maximum Mountain Bike and others. He also wrote for Clarks Originals, for whom he wrote a book about 50 years of the (Clarks) Desert Boot. In early 2000, he started working for 9feet.com, a startup website based on the 'online shop with editorial content' model, specialising in outdoor gear. He worked there for nearly a year until meeting Mark Alker and Shaun Murray, then of www.gofar-mtb.com, a privately run mountain bike website. They suggested he join them and start making a print magazine. The three of them created Singletrack in 2001 with Chippendale as founding editor. He is still the editor and regularly writes and photographs for it. Chippendale is generally credited with popularising singlespeed mountain biking in the UK - an idea he claims to have stolen from Bike magazine's editor Mike Ferrentino - and is a collaborator in The Outcast, an underground singlespeed fanzine. He organised the UK's first Singlespeed National Championships in 1995 (Stow on the Wold) and subsequent ones in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2001 (all in Cheddar, Somerset), culminating in organising the Singlespeed World Championships in Afan Argoed in 2001. He is also the organiser of the Todmorden cyclocross race, held every year since 2009 and based on a well-established event that used to take place in the town. Chipps moved to Todmorden in late 2001, coinciding with Singletrack getting its first office. He has been a resident ever since and now calls it home, despite his southern upbringing. Chippendale was awarded the Cycling Media Legend award at the 2015 Cycling Media Awards.

Arnold Schoenberg (1996), p 63 In the three years between February 1919 and 5 December 1921 (when the Verein had to cease its activities due to Austrian hyperinflation), the organization gave 353 performances of 154 works in 117 concerts that involved a total of 79 individuals and pre-existing ensembles.Verein für Musikalische Privataufführungen (Belmont catalogue) Circumstances permitting, concerts were given at the rate of one per week, with each programme consisting entirely of works from the period 'Mahler to the present'. The range of music included was very wide, the 'allowable' composers not being confined to the 'Schoenberg circle' but drawn from all those who had (as Schoenberg himself put it) 'a real face or name'. During the Society's first two years, in fact, Schoenberg did not allow any of his own music to be performed; instead, the programmes included works by Bartók, Berg, Busoni, Debussy, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Mahler, Ravel, Reger, Satie, Richard Strauss, Stravinsky, Webern, and many others. The players at these events were chosen from among the most gifted young musicians available, and each work was rehearsed intensively, either under Schoenberg himself or by a Vortragsmeister ('Performance Director') specifically appointed by him. (The list of Vortragsmeister included Berg, Webern, Benno Sachs, Rudolf Kolisch, Erwin Stein and Eduard Steuermann). Clarity and comprehensibility of the musical presentation was the over-riding aim, with audiences sometimes being permitted to hear 'open rehearsals', and complex works sometimes being played more than once in the same concert (and as many as five or six times in total).Guittart, Henk (2015). Clarity and Precision: Arnold Schoenberg’s concept of presenting new music to an audience Only those who had joined the organisation were admitted to the events: the intention was to prevent casual attendance by 'sensation-seeking' members of the Viennese public (who would often attend concerts with the express intention of causing disruption, whistling derisively at 'modern' works by blowing across their house-keys) as well as exclude hostile critics who would attack such music in their newspaper columns: a sign displayed on the door - in the manner of a police notice - would state that Kritikern ist der Eintritt verboten ('Critics are forbidden entry'). Such was the didactic seriousness of the Society that an event's programme was not revealed in advance; nor was applause (or any demonstration of disapproval) permitted after the performance of a work.From 'The Prospectus of the Society for Private Musical Performances' (1918), reprinted in It was in an attempt to continue the Society's activities in the face of hyperinflation that Schoenberg tried to raise money by means of an extraordinary concert during the Society's third season. On 27 May 1921, a performance took place of four waltzes by Johann Strauss in chamber arrangements for string quartet, piano and harmonium. \\"Roses From the South\\" and \\"Lagoon Waltz\\" were arranged by Schoenberg; \\"Wine, Woman and Song\\" was arranged by Alban Berg; and \\"The Treasure Waltz\\" (from The Gypsy Baron was arranged by Anton von Webern. Following the performance, the autograph scores of these arrangements were auctioned. However, the Society nevertheless closed down, leaving one of its most ambitious projects - an arrangement by Hans Eisler, Karl Rankl and Erwin Stein of Bruckner's Symphony No 7 - unperformed. A successor Society under the aegis of Alexander von Zemlinsky, with Schoenberg as Honorary President and Heinrich Jalowetz and Viktor Ullmann among the 'Performance Directors', operated in Prague from April 1922 to May 1924. At its peak its membership was over 400, substantially larger than the Vienna Society - and, also unlike the Vienna society (whose membership was largely made up of professional musicians), the membership of the Prague society was chiefly amateurs: a study published in 1974 instances 'civil servants, writers, doctors, lawyers, university and school teachers, businessmen, actors and painters' as well as 'students and musicians of all kinds'.

Many of its clients were among the wealthiest and most powerful families in the state. Founded in 1903, the firm operated until 1935 as a partnership, when Aldrich left for an appointment in Rome. Delano continued in his practice nearly until his death in 1960. History The firm was founded in 1903 by William Adams Delano and Chester Holmes Aldrich, who met when they worked together at the office of Carrère and Hastings in the years before the turn of the 20th century. Almost immediately after the firm was formed, they won commissions from the Rockefeller family, among others. Delano & Aldrich tended to adapt conservative Georgian and Federal architectural styles for their townhouses, churches, schools, and a spate of social clubs for the Astors, Vanderbilts, and the Whitneys. Separately (Delano was the more prolific) and in tandem, they designed a number of buildings at Yale. Their work was part of the architecture event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Aldrich left the partnership in 1935 to become the resident director of the American Academy at Rome, where he died in 1940. Delano continued to practice almost until his death in 1960.

The main effect of the Act was to establish elected county councils in Scotland. In this it followed the pattern introduced in England and Wales by the Local Government Act 1888. County councils The Act provided that a county council should be established in each county, consisting of elected councillors. The county was to be divided into electoral divisions, made up of groupings of parishes, each returning one councillor. In addition police burghs in the county were also regarded as electoral divisions, though the councillors for these areas were co-opted by the members of the burgh's town council. The chairman of each county council, elected by the members, was given the title \\"Convenor of the county\\". Powers transferred to the county councils The county councils received numerous powers and duties previously performed by a number of bodies: *Commissioners of Supply for the county *County road trustees *Justices of the peace of the county in general or special or quarter sessions Among the diverse functions acquired from the justices were inspection of gas meters, regulation of explosive materials, weights and measures, habitual drunkards, control of wild birds and providing visitors to asylums. In addition the county council exercised authority under the Public Health Acts for the entire county outside burghs. They also had jurisdiction under legislation dealing with contagious animal diseases and destructive insects. County councils also took over police functions from burghs with less than 7,000 population. Section 15 of the Act allowed the Secretary for Scotland to transfer further powers to the councils. Areas and boundaries The counties were initially to have the same boundaries as those already existing with some stated exceptions: *The county of Lanark was to be united. Previously, for some administrative purposes it comprised three counties, known as the counties of the lower, middle or upper ward of Lanark. *The counties of Ross and Cromarty were to be united \\"for all purposes whatsoever\\" as the county of Ross and Cromarty. *The boundaries of the counties of Dumbarton and Stirling were to be adjusted, so that the entire parishes of Cumbernauld and Kirkintilloch were to be in Dunbartonshire. This area remained an exclave of Dunbartonshire until the county council's abolition in 1975. Stirling was gained the lands north of Endrick Water as far as the centre-line of Loch Lomond. *Part of the county of Banff was transferred to the county of Aberdeen; and part of the county of Elgin was transferred to the county of Banff. These areas had already been administered by the counties in question under highways legislation. *The county of Orkney and lordship of Zetland were separated to form two counties with those names. =Boundary changes= It was recognised in the Act that the boundaries of the counties would need to be altered. Accordingly, section 45 established a body styled the Boundary Commissioners for Scotland to form county electoral divisions, and to simplify the boundaries of counties, burghs and parishes, so that (1) each burgh and county would be, if expedient, within a single county, (2) no part of a county would be detached therefrom, and (3) no part of a parish would be detached therefrom, and to arbitrate disputes between local authorities arising from boundary changes. All boundary changes made by the commissioners came into full effect on 15 May 1892. For most purposes, however, the bulk of the changes became effective a year earlier, on 15 May 1891. Subsequent to the commissioners' dissolution, the Secretary for Scotland had the power to vary boundaries on the application of a council. =Districts and district committees= Each county (unless it contained fewer than six parishes) was to be divided into districts consisting of groups of electoral divisions. Each district was to have a district committee consisting of the area's county councillors, one representative from each parochial board in the district, and one from each burgh. The committees performed the county council's functions in respect of the Public Health Acts and highways legislation.

Randolph Kirkpatrick (1863 - 1950) was a British spongiologist, cnidariologist and bryozoologist. He was assistant keeper of lower invertebrates at the British Natural History Museum from 1886 until his retirement in 1927. Kirkpatrick published a limited number of papers on the sponges of Antarctica and the Indian Ocean. However, his most significant work was carried out on Merlia, a species of coralline sponge (a sponge which secretes a coral-like limestone skeleton). He was the first to correctly interpret these unusual sponges, but his work was largely ignored until the 1960s when T. F. Goreau and his colleagues W. D. Hartman and Jeremy Jackson rediscovered the coralline sponges in the reefs of the West Indies. It is likely that his important work on the coralline sponges was dismissed by his contemporaries due to his having published a book containing unconventional ideas about the history of life on earth. This was the self- published The Nummulosphere: an account of the Organic Origin of so-called Igneous Rocks and Abyssal Red Clays (1912), printed in four volumes by Lamley & Co. of South Kensington. Kirkpatrick's theory proposed that Earth was originally covered with water and that larger benthic foraminifera of the genus Nummulites eventually accumulated into a layer which he called 'The Nummulosphere'. He additionally proposed that all the Earth's crustal rocks were subsequently derived from this \\"nummulosphaeric\\" layer and in his books he included illustrations of supposed nummulitic textures he had observed in granites and even meteorites.Crazy Old Randolph Kirkpatrick by Stephen Jay Gould, Natural History 87(3), collected in The Panda's Thumb: More Reflections in Natural History (Norton, 1980) References External links * *Text of \\"The Nummulosphere\\" (at archive.org) Category:1863 births Category:1950 deaths Category:Cnidariologists Category:Spongiologists Category:Byrozoologists ","title":"Randolph Kirkpatrick"},{"id":"3399571","text":"Anita Ramasastry is the D.

The project employed a number of technical means, as well as an international network of investigators, to determine the extent and nature of government-run internet filtering programs. Participating academic institutions included the Citizen Lab at the Munk Centre for International Studies, University of Toronto; Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard Law School; the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) at University of Oxford; and, The SecDev Group, which took over from the Advanced Network Research Group at the Cambridge Security Programme, University of Cambridge. In December 2014 the OpenNet Initiative partners announced that they would no longer carry out research under the ONI banner. The ONI website, including all reports and data, is being maintained indefinitely to allow continued public access to ONI's entire archive of published work and data.\\"Looking Forward: A Note of Appreciation and Closure on a Decade of Research\\", OpenNet Initiative, 18 December 2014. Accessed 11 April 2015. Methods ONI used several methods to test and document internet censorship in a country. * Development and deployment of a suite of technical enumeration tools and core methodologies for the study of Internet filtering and surveillance; * Capacity-building among networks of local advocates and researchers; * Advanced studies exploring the consequences of current and future trends and trajectories in filtering and surveillance practices, and their implications for domestic and international law and governance regimes.

It is located in the western part of Rajasthan state forming a part of the Thar Desert. Barmer is the third largest district by area in Rajasthan and fifth largest district in India. Occupying an area of 28,387 km2. Being in the western part of the state, it includes a part of the Thar Desert. Jaisalmer is to the north of this district while Jalore is in its south. Pali and Jodhpur form its eastern border and it shares a border with Pakistan in the west. Partially being a desert, this district has a large variation in temperature. The temperature in summer can rise up to 51 °C and falls near to 0 °C in winter. Luni is the longest river in Barmer district. After travelling a length of almost 500 km, it passes through Jalore and merges in the marshy land of Runn of Kutch. District headquarters is in the town of Barmer. The other major towns in the district are: Balotra, Guda Malani, Baytoo, Siwana, and Chohatan. Recently, a large onshore oil field has been discovered and made functional in Barmer district. In earlier times, the district was known as Malani, in the name of Rawal Mallinath (मल्लिनाथ). Rawal Mallinath was the son of Rao Salkha and Rawal Mallinath is cultural, philanthropical and religious icon in Barmer, He is worshiped as God by local peoples. The whole area around the river Luni was said to have Malani (मलानी), derived from the name Mallinath. Present name of Barmer is derived from its founder ruler Bahada Rao or Bar Rao Parmar (Juna Barmer), it was named Bahadamer (\\"The Hill Fort of Bahada\\"). He built a small town which is presently known as “Juna” which is 25 km from present city of Barmer. After Parmer’s, Rawat Luka -Grand Son of Rawal Mallinath, establish their kingdom in Juna Barmer with help of his brother Rawal Mandalak. They defeated Parmers of Juna & made it their capital. Thereafter, his descendant, Rawat Bhima, who was a great warrior, established the present city of Barmer in 1552 AD and shifted his capital to Barmer from Juna. . Geography Barmer is located in the western part of the state forming a part of the Thar Desert. The district borders Jaisalmer district in the north, Jalore district in the south, Pali district and Jodhpur district in the east, and Pakistan in the west. The total area of the district is . After Jaisalmer district and Bikaner district, it is the third largest district of Rajasthan. It is also the fifth largest district in the country. The district is located between 24,58' to 26, 32'N Latitudes and 70, 05' to 72, 52' E Longitudes. The longest river in the district is the Luni. It is 480 km in length and drain into the Gulf of Kutch passing through Jalore. The variation in temperature in various seasons is quite high owing to arid thar desert and sandy soil. In summers the temperature soars to 46 °C to 51 °C. In winters it drops to 0 °C (41 °F). Primarily Barmer district is a desert where average rainfall in a year is 277 mm. However, extreme rainfall of 549 mm rain between 16 and 25 August 2006 left many dead and huge losses due to flood in a nearby town Kawas and whole town submerged. As many as twenty new lakes formed, with six covering an area of over 10 km2. Poorly planned and rapid urbanisation has increased Barmer's vulnerability to flash flooding. The local ecology and soil type is not equipped to deal with sudden or excessive water accumulation, which causes short- and long-term damage. Other areas suffer the gradual effects of ‘invisible disasters’, which also threaten the lives and livelihoods of the locals.Local approaches to harmonising climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction: Lessons from India, Anshu Sharma, Sahba Chauhan and Sunny Kumar, SEEDS India, 2014 =Climate= Economy In 2016 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named Barmer one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). It is one of the twelve districts in Rajasthan currently receiving funds from the Backward Regions Grant Fund Programme (BRGF).

The park's total area is with Lake Whetsel, a picnic pavilion, a shelter house and a children's playground with equipment. The lake is open for fishing from February though October (7am–7pm). Fort Zumwalt Park hosts O'Fallon's annual Celebration of Lights, a drive-through display of light decorations, every Christmas season, and is home to the St. Charles Model Railroad Club. The site also includes the Darius Heald Home. Formerly a state park since 1939, the State of Missouri sold the property to the City of O'Fallon in 1978 for one dollar. The Heald Home was restored in 2001 and reconstruction of Zumwalt's fort was completed in 2015. Zumwalt's Fort The hill on which Jacob Zumwalt built his home was part of a nearly Spanish land grant that he accepted in 1796, with land on both sides of Belleau Creek. Zumwalt was a Revolutionary War veteran, one of only a few who settled in Saint Charles County, Missouri. His family originally came from Pennsylvania and spent some time in Kentucky before moving to Missouri. Zumwalt's extended family helped him complete the first section of the home in 1798, with additions made in following years. It is believed to have been the first hewn log house north of the Missouri River, and its four rooms, stone foundation, double-fireplace, and other Pennsylvania German construction details set it apart from other homes. The family was of Methodist faith and the first Methodist sacrament in Missouri was in the home in 1807. The home was called \\"Zumwalt's Fort\\" because area families would gather there for protection from raids during the War of 1812. There were seven such homestead forts in St. Charles County. Area fighting with Native Americans ended by 1815, when peace treaties were signed nearby. Zumwalt raised ten children from two wives, and in 1817, moved adjacent to a son-in-law in Callaway County, Missouri, where he died in 1820. =After Zumwalt= Upon moving, Zumwalt sold his homestead fort to Nathan and Rebekah Heald for $1000 in 1817. Their son Darius was born there in 1822 and lived in the homestead for most of his life. After the Heald family owned the land for nearly 100 years, it was sold outside the family in 1914 and then split among three owners. The portion that contained the fort was sold to Fred Gentemann who converted it into use as a barn. In September 1929, primarily through efforts by two Heald family members, a commemorative marker was placed along nearby U.S. Highway 40 (aligned then through St. Peters to St. Charles) to share the history of the site. In 1936, a state historical group presented resolutions to petition the state legislature to buy surrounding the fort for a state park. The following year, funds to expand the state park system were approved and in 1938, the state filed condemnation proceedings to acquire for the park, which it bought from three owners (including Gentemann) for $9,000 in early 1939. Initially, the state park was used mostly by O'Fallon residents, though it gradually became a popular camping and relaxation point for travelers on U.S. 40 (and later Interstate 70). The central chimney was rebuilt in 1960, apparently from only reclaimed pieces of the fort's foundations as no stone was ordered for the job. As part of an archaeological survey of all its parks, and with initial plans for reconstruction of the fort, the state of Missouri sponsored excavations around parts of the fort for several weeks in 1975, the findings of which suggested the prior presence of a smoke house and blacksmithing activity. In 1978, the state sold the park to the City of O'Fallon for $1, requiring that it continue to be maintained as a public park. In 2005, with permission by the city, the O'Fallon Community Foundation resumed long-delayed plans to restore the fort and hired the Archaeology Research Center of St. Louis to complete excavations around it. =Reconstruction and legacy= All that remained of the original Zumwalt home as of September 2008 was its internal stone chimney with two fireplaces, one on either side. In 2008, the O'Fallon Community Foundation began work on the reconstruction of Zumwalt's home. On September 30, 2009, the foundation held a ribbon cutting to celebrate the completion of the first phase of the reconstruction of Jacob Zumwalt's homestead fort. The plan was to have all three phases of Zumwalt's log structures reconstructed by 2012 in timing with the bicentennial of the War of 1812. By the end of 2013, however, delays had put the completion time in doubt. The reconstructed fort opened in 2015. The local Fort Zumwalt School District R-II was renamed after this fort in 1966; the district's first high school has been named for the fort since 1960. A total of four high schools in the district now have the Fort Zumwalt name, appended with their relative compass directions. In the 1970s, a spring on the property was dammed to form Lake Whetsel, named for Ed Whetsel, a member of the O'Fallon Parks Board. Heald Home Darius Heald in 1893, holding his father's sword among other relics Darius Heald built a new large brick home near the fort in 1884 and called it \\"Stony Point\\". Its architecture has been referred to as \\"German- Italianate-Victorian\\" – primarily of German construction, with Italian influence in the porch columns and balcony railing. Heald died in 1904 and a tornado destroyed the upper floor of the house in 1915. Before selling the home in 1916, the family rebuilt its upper story with original recovered bricks, though it was about a foot shorter in height. A state park superintendent is known to have lived in the home in 1959. Beginning in 1961, the state removed what had been the Heald's brick smoke house, and took its bricks to Arrow Rock for reuse, apparently in restoration of the Dr. Hall House. After decades of use and nonuse, the Heald house was in need of repair, and was restored in 2001 by the City of O'Fallon and the O'Fallon Community Foundation.

It worked to make sure software licensed under the GNU General Public License was not used in ways prohibited by the license. Goals The goals of the project were, according to its website, to: * Raise public awareness of the infringing use of free software, and thus putting pressure on the infringers, * Give users who detect or assume GPL-licensed software is being misused a way to report them to the copyright holders, * Assist copyright holders in any action against GPL infringing organizations, and to * Distribute information on how a commercial entity using GPL licensed software in their products can comply with the license. About the GPL-Violations.org Project In May 2008, gpl-violations.org and the Free Software Foundation Europe Freedom Task Force announced that they were to deepen their previous cooperation. The FSFE Freedom Task Force will be focusing on educating and informing, while gpl-violations.org will focus on enforcing the GPL.GPL- Violations.org and FSFE's Freedom Task Force to work more closely together History The gpl-violations.org project was founded in 2004 by Harald Welte. Welte was a kernel developer who had been actively enforcing the GPL license on his netfilter/iptables code since late 2003. Since then, other developers have given gpl-Violations.org legal right to represent them. While the Software Freedom Conservancy's GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers, operates from the USA, gpl-violations.org operates from Germany, Welte's home country. Armijn Hemel has been a notable contributor since 2005. The project has been credited with being the first to prove in court that the GPL is valid and that it will stand up in court. Project creator Harald Welte received the 2007 FSF Award for the Advancement of Free Software, partly because of his work on gpl-violations.org. From January till October, 2015, the website was offline and no longer resolved. It planned to continue its activities in 2016.gpl-violations.org homepage recovers, gpl-violations.org, November 7, 2015 Its activities resumed by November 2015. Notable victories = Fortinet = In 2005, the gpl-violations.org project uncovered evidence that Fortinet had used GPL code in its products against the terms of the license, and used cryptographic tools to conceal the violation. The violation was alleged to have occurred in the FortiOS system, which the gpl- violations.org project said contained elements of the Linux kernel. In response, a Munich court granted a temporary injunction against the company, preventing it from selling products until they were in compliance with the necessary license terms;GPL-Violations.org project was granted a preliminary injunction against Fortinet UK Ltd Fortinet was forced to make their FortiOS available free in compliance with GPL licensing.Fortinet GPL Sources =D-Link= On September 6, 2006, the gpl-violations.org project prevailed in court litigation against D-Link Germany GmbH regarding D-Link's alleged inappropriate and copyright infringing use of parts of the Linux kernel.GPL- Violations.org project prevails in court case on GPL violation by D-Link The judgement Unofficial English translation of the D-Link court judgement finally provided the on-record, legal precedent that the GPL is valid and that it will stand up in German courts.

It is believed to have six subspecies and possibly a seventh existing in southwest Africa. Dik-diks are herbivores, typically of a fawn color that aids in camouflaging themselves in savannah habitats. According to MacDonald (1985), they are also capable of reaching speeds up to 42 km/hour. The lifespan of Kirk's dik-dik in the wild is typically 5 years, but may surpass 10 years. In captivity, males have been known to live up to 16.5 years, while females have lived up to 18.4 years.  Etymology  The dik-dik's name is derived from its call. When they feel threatened, dik-diks lie low to prevent detection. If they are discovered, they run in a swift, zigzag-like pattern until they reach refuge in a nearby thicket. During this ‘flight’, they emit trumpet-like \\"zik-zik\\" calls to raise an alarm or to harass predators and publicize the presence of a mated pair.  Physical characteristics  Dik-diks are some of the world's smallest antelopes, with the largest, the Kirk's dik-dik, standing between 14 and 18 inches tall and weighing no more than . Female dik-diks tend to be 1 to 2 pounds heavier than males. They are dainty creatures with a pointed, mobile snout, large eyes and ears, prominent preorbital glands, pipestem legs, hare- like hind limbs that are significantly larger than their forelimbs, and a vestigial tail. Their coats, depending upon their habitat, range from grey to gray-brown with tan flanks, limbs, and an erectile head crest and whitish eye rings, ear lining, underparts, and rump. Only male dik-diks sport horns, which are about 3 in (8 cm) long, corrugated, and backward-slanted. Horns of male Kirk's dik-diks may be straight or curved backwards from the profile of the face, and the basal half of the horns have seven to nine annular ridges that are frequently covered by the crest. Kirk's dik-diks are sexually dimorphic; females are larger and lack horns, while males sport a more developed muzzle, have a longer crest, and tend to be lighter in color. Though physically very similar, Kirk's dik-dik can be distinguished from Guenthers’ dik-dik by its longer nasals and premaxillae and shorter proboscis, which gives the head a more wedged-shaped profile than that of Guenther's dik-dik.  Adaptations  Kirk's dik-diks are highly adapted to surviving in the arid regions of eastern Africa. They have a hairy proboscis with tiny, slit-like nostrils, a feature that is most pronounced in Guenther's dik-diks. This proboscis contains an enlarged nasal chamber supplied with a rich amount of blood that is cooled by rapid nasal panting. Panting through their snouts leads to airflow and evaporation that cools the blood before it is pumped back into the body. This process is also efficient, because it results in a minimal loss of water in the exhaled air. Water- and energy-conserving methods, such as fluctuating body temperatures, lowered metabolic rates, concentrated urine, and dry feces, all contribute to the ability of the dik-dik to survive harsh arid climates. Further,Hoppe 1977b, Kamau 1988, and Maloiy et al., 1988, they also conserve fluids by licking dew from their nose and reabsorbing water from their feces. When compared to cattle, dik-diks have a significantly lower density of sweat glands. Behaviorally, dik-diks are highly nocturnal, and during the daytime seek shade to rest throughout the hottest parts of the day to help avoid the loss of valuable fluids. Dik-diks are also highly selective when browsing on succulents, herbs, and foliage as to maximize fluid acquisition. The hind legs of Kirk's dik-diks are longer and are structurally more uniform, than the fore legs. Hopwood 1936 suggests this helps the hind legs propel the dik-dik forward, as the relatively short fore legs of dik-diks are more efficient at ascending broken terrain.  Habitat and territoriality  Females, Etosha National Park, Namibia \\"Kirk's dik-dik are endemic to savanna areas of eastern and southwestern Africa, occurring primarily in the Somali and Southwest arid biotic zones, but encroaching into the Southern savanna biotic zone\\". Their distribution can be described as discontinuous and as a result they often occur in dispersed patches due to their unique habitat requirements. In Namibia, Kirk's dik-dik occur in isolated areas along the Fish River and do not reside in the Namib desert, though they may traverse desert thickets along sources of water. They prefer habitats with good cover but lacking tall vegetation. Ideal habitats contain a variety of browse, extensive shade, and an open understory at their eye level. (Tinley, 1969) As a result, they move to different ranges when grass grows too high and obstructs their view. As noted by Tinley (1969), typical habitats of Kirk's dik-dik consist of thicket mosaics characterized by well-developed shrub layers and scant short grass cover. Dik-diks live in pairs on territories of 2–86 acres, depending on cover and resources. If no unfavorable events occur a pair of Kirk's dik-dik may reside within the same territory for life. Males are the main defenders of territories, as females are unable to maintain territories themselves. (Kingdon 1982) According to MacDonald (1985), territorial conflicts over quality habitat are not frequent, however, when do they occur, males charge one another, stopping just short of physical contact, before repeating the process by running from a longer distance. Furthermore, the encounter ends when one male surrenders, which results in both males scratching at the ground, urinating, and defecating\\".  Diet  Dik-dik are herbivorous and their diets consist mainly of foliage, fruits, shoots, and berries. Due to their adaptations, dik-diks are water-independent and rely on vegetation as a source of water. Kirk's dik-diks are concentrate selectors, feeding selectively on dicotyledonous plants that can be rapidly fermented and digested. This includes leaves and fruit high in nutrients and water, but low in fiber and cellulose. Grasses are only consumed when they are germinating and Kirk's dik-diks have stomach capacities and mass that consist of 8.5–10.0% of body mass when full and 2.2% when empty\\". Because of the aforementioned facts and their high food requirements, Kirk's dik-diks feed and ruminate periodically throughout day and night. They consume roughly 3.8% of their body mass daily.  Reproduction and behavior  Similar to other dwarf antelopes, Kirk's dik-diks exist in monogamous pairs on territories. Territories are marked with dung and urine that are deposited in a ritual that is performed to help helps maintain pair bonds. During the ritual, the female will excrete, followed by the male, which samples the female's urine stream to check her reproductive capacity. He paws over and then marks his dung and urine over her deposit. Finally, the pair marks nearby twigs with secretions from their preorbital glands. The male courts the female by running up behind her with his head and neck stretched and his muzzle pointing out in front. Copulation begins with the male standing on his hind legs behind the female and waving his forelegs at an acute angle to his own body in the air over her back\\". Copulation typically occurs three to five times within a 9-hour period. Kirk's dik-diks have a gestation period of 5–6 months, and may produce up to two offspring per year. Females reach sexual maturity between 6 and 8 months of age, while this occurs for males between 8 and 9 months. Dik-diks produce one offspring per gestation. Most births occur between November and December and April through May, which coincides with the timing of the rainy seasons. Dik- diks differ from other ruminants in that offspring are born with their fore legs along the body, rather than extended forward. After birth, the offspring lie concealed away from their mother 2–3 weeks, and survival rates for fawns are roughly 50%. Once offspring reach a certain age, they also begin to participate in the bonding ritual, and remain with the parents until another offspring is born. At this point, the parents chase the older sibling out of their territory. The older offspring then seeks out its own territory and mate.  Genetics  Dik-diks in general have complex chromosomal arrangements. They typically have 2n=46 to 2n=48 arrangements; however, dik- diks with 2n=49 have been discovered, as well. Furthermore, some have 47 chromosomes with X/A translocation. The two common cytotypes (46- and 48-chromosome individuals) are different enough so that resulting hybrids are sterile. Many zoos are now known to harbor hybrids between different cytotypes, with anomalous chromosome numbers and causing unexplained sterility. Examination of these individuals shows a lack of spermatogenesis in males, for example hybrids between Kirk's and Guenther's dik-diks are infertile.  Predators  Dik-diks are susceptible to a myriad of predators including eagles, wildcats, jackals, caracals, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, Cape wild dogs, honey badgers, crocodiles, pythons, lions, monitors, and humans. Young dik-diks are particularly preyed upon by baboons, genets, and eagles. Dik-diks have fine-tuned senses of hearing, sight, and smell. When they feel in danger or hear the alarm calls of other animals, they hide, rather than flee. Only when frightened or disturbed do they emit their iconic \\"zik-zik\\" alarm.  Human impacts and interactions  Humans are the greatest threat to dik-diks, which are sometimes hunted for their hides and bones, often using snares. The bones from their legs and feet are used in traditional jewelry, while their hides are fashioned into suede gloves. An entire dik-dik hide is required to produce a single glove. Nowak (1991) asserted that dik-dik are disliked by local hunters because they flush and warn larger game to the presence of humans. Dik-diks also benefit from the destruction of vegetation via human-mediated slash-and-burn agriculture that results in the subsequent secondary growth of shrubs that serve as a food source and place of refuge for dik-diks. The IUCN Redlist lists Kirk's dik-dik as \\"least concern\\". Subspecies Usually, four subspecies of Kirk's dik-dik are distinguished, but they may represent three or more distinct species: * M. k. kirkii Günther, 1880 * M. k. cavendishi Thomas, 1898 – Cavendish's dik-dik * M. k. damarensis Günther, 1880 – Damara dik-dik * M. k. hindei Thomas, 1898 Gallery File:Damara Dik-Dik.JPGM. k. damarensis female, Etosha National Park, Namibia File:Dikdik Looking.JPGJuvenile File:Dik-Dik, family, Lake Manyara.jpgFamily, Lake Manyara, Tanzania File:Madoqua kirkii.jpgMale, Etosha, Namibia References *Animal, Smithsonian Institution, 2005, pg. 253 Kirk's dik-dik Category:Mammals of Angola Category:Mammals of Namibia Category:Mammals of Kenya Category:Mammals of Tanzania Category:Mammals of Somalia Category:Mammals of Uganda Kirk's dik- dik ","title":"Kirk's dik-dik"},{"id":"3399676","text":"The Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis involved four human rights workers of Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) who were held hostage in Iraq from November 26, 2005 by the Swords of Righteousness Brigade. One hostage, Tom Fox, was killed, and the remaining three freed in a military operation on March 23, 2006.  Capture  On 26 November 2005, masked gunman stopped a car carrying 4 members of the CPTs (Christian Peacemaker Teams) and abducted them; the abduction took place in the university area of Baghdad-an area that had been a scene of trouble since US Marines had arrived in the area, with American troops fighting battles with Fedayeen lasting days.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , p.113-114 The four CPTs had planned to visit the Muslim Clerics Association, an influential group of Sunni religious leaders formed in 2003 after the collapse of the former regime. They were about 100 metres from the entrance to the mosque where the meeting was to take place when they were abducted. Their driver and translator were not taken. The hostages were: * Tom Fox, 54, of Clearbrook, Virginia, U.S., a leader of youth programs at Langley Hill Friends Meeting and Baltimore Yearly Meeting. * Norman Kember, 74, of Pinner, London, U.K., a retired professor of medical physics. * James Loney, 41, of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, program coordinator for CPT Canada. * Harmeet Singh Sooden, 33, a Canadian electrical engineer studying in New Zealand. = The Christian Peacemaker Teams in Iraq = The hostages were members of Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT's) Iraq project, which began working in 2002, before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Their goal is to document and publicize abuses of human rights occurring in the country, especially in relation to detainees, and to advocate for peaceful solutions to conflict. During the crisis, CPT's Iraq team issued statements asking that the hostages be freed so they could continue their work. A distinctive feature of this crisis was the victims' dedication to non- violence. CPT condemned the actions of the kidnappers, but maintained pacifist principles by refusing to call for any violent rescue effort. The kidnappings led to widespread sympathy and support, with calls for their release coming from diverse Muslim, Christian and secular groups in the West and Middle East. However, supporters of the Iraq War have criticized the team's presence in Iraq. Throughout the crisis, CPT continued to campaign for Iraqi human rights, attempting to link support for their own workers to support for \\"thousands of Iraqis who are being detained illegally.\\" CPT continues to hold that the \\"illegal occupation of Iraq...is the root cause of the insecurity that led to this kidnapping\\".CPTers Freed  Major developments  = Kidnappers' demands = The kidnappers called themselves the Swords of Righteousness Brigade, and published a video shown worldwide on November 29, 2005 by Arab satellite channel Al Jazeera, in which they claimed the hostages were spies. They threatened to kill all hostages unless the US freed all Iraqi prisoners held in the US and Iraq by December 8, 2005. They later extended this deadline to December 10, 2005. The complexity of the crisis deepened when Moazzam Begg and Abu Qatada, who was Osama bin Laden's so-called Ambassador in Europe joined in the appeals for Kember's release-but the appeals were ignored by the kidnappers.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin, 2012 , p.114-115 More than a month passed until the next word from the kidnappers. On January 28, 2006, Al Jazeera broadcast a video showing the four hostages alive, dated January 21, 2006. The captors stated that the U.S. and Britain had one last chance to free all Iraqi prisoners or the hostages would be killed. = One hostage found murdered = On March 10, 2006 the body of Tom Fox was found atop a garbage dump in Baghdad, killed by gunshot wounds to the head and chest. The hands of the corpse were bound together. CNN reported that Iraqi policemen claimed Fox's body showed signs of torture. This report was widely repeated in other media outlets, although no further sources were named. This initial report has been challenged by CPT who claim that members of the group saw no evidence of torture upon viewing the body at a stateside funeral home and on examination of Fox's face and hands immediately after the body was recovered.CPTers Freed CPT claims that two independent sources who examined the body more closely also found no evidence of torture. A member of the group added that he believed claims of torture \\"further demonize the other side.\\"denies Fox was tortured. March 2, 2006 London Free Press - National News - The results of an independent autopsy have not been made public. Upon Fox's death the CPT released a statement of condolences, also asking that the world not \\"vilify or demonize others, no matter what they have done.\\" They quoted Fox himself, saying, \\"We reject violence to punish anyone ... We forgive those who consider us their enemies.\\"10 March 2006 CPT Release: We Mourn the Loss of Tom Fox = Military action & recovery of surviving hostages = Following their kidnapping; Task Force Knight-the British special forces task force in Iraq-initiated Operation Lightwater; spearheaded by B squadron, 22nd SAS Regiment, the aim of which was to find and recover the hostages; a small team of JTF2 (the equivalent Canadian Tier 1 special forces unit) and Canadian intelligence experts joined the task force for the operation; the United States provided technical intelligence to the operation. The Task Force prioritised Operation Lightwater over its new operations under JSOC against AQI and other terrorists and insurgents in Iraq. Operation Lightwater involved raiding houses and arresting suspects almost every day and night-with the main purpose of gathering intelligence; intelligence sources and materials seized in the raids revealed more about the terrorist group the kidnappers belonged to and when exploited (particularly of mobile phone sources), resulted in further raids. The total number of building raids amounted to 50, 44 of them being by British special forces including a total detained 47 people, only 4 of the raids were classed as 'dry holes'-places that were not productive of any useful information, the operation was instrumental in finding the hostages.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.122-p.123,p.127-p.128,p.130 In the early hours of 23 March 2006, as part of Operation Lightwater, the SAS carried out Operation Ney 3: their target was a house in Mishahda, 20 miles northwest of Baghdad, they found two men they were looking for, whom revealed under pressure during interrogation/tactical questioning the location of the hostages in western Baghdad. Wary of an ambush, the SAS telephoned the kidnappers moments before the SAS assault on the house and were warned to the kidnappers to leave their location. At 0800, B squadron SAS stormed the house, finding the kidnappers had abandoned the building and rescued the hostages, the hostages were ushered into a waiting Bradley IFV and the SAS exfilled in their Humvees.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.129-130Neville, Leigh, Special Forces in the War on Terror (General Military), Osprey Publishing, 2015 ,p.212 The Times reported that the SAS were supported by 'Task Force Maroon', a support unit made up of British paratroopers and marines. Other sources include the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the rescue effort.CTV.ca  Elite Canadian soldiers helped free hostages: CTV The three surviving hostages were in good medical condition. While captive, they had been allowed to exercise and Kember had received medication he needs. It was reported that the CPT had not cooperated with the SAS officials who coordinated the operation to recover the hostages. CPT co-director Doug Pritchard stated that they did not want a \\"military raid\\" to occur and preferred to work with diplomats. Aftermath = Charges of ingratitude towards military personnel = As they removed the hostages from the scene, the SAS soldiers found Kember hard to get any response from, one SAS soldier said \\"[He] was the most frustrating individual I have ever met in my life. From the point of lifting him he didn't address one word to us.\\" In the UK, the story of that Kember had refused to thank his rescuers quickly gained currency, the soldier added that \\"the following day the Ambassador wheeled him over to our house [MSS Fernandez] and Kember finally said, if I remember his actual words, \\"Thanks for saving my life\\".\\"Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.131 CPT and the victims were criticized for their reluctance to thank the troops who freed them. Following the release of the hostages, CPT's initial statement omitted any expression of gratitude toward the soldiers involved, but issued such a statement 12 hours later, with their gratitude that no shots were fired during the mission. General Sir Mike Jackson, Commander of the British Army, told British Channel 4 news he was \\"saddened that there does not seem to have been a note of gratitude [from Mr. Kember] for the soldiers who risked their lives to save those lives\\". James Loney and Norman Kember later publicly thanked the soldiers for rescuing them. Harmeet Sooden issued a statement thanking the soldiers for saving him as well. = Propaganda = Maj. Gen Rick Lynch, the briefer at Multi-National Force – Iraq Headquarters exploited Operation Lightwater success to counter stories from the previous months of Iraqi prisoner abuse, telling reporters that \\"the key point is it was intelligence-led. It was information provided by a detainee.\\" = Refusal to testify = On December 8, 2006, the three ex- hostages held a press conference at St Ethelburga's Centre for Reconciliation, in London, to announce that they would not testify at the trial of their captors if there was a risk they will face execution. Under Iraqi law, kidnapping is currently punishable by the death penalty. Loney was quoted as saying, \\"We bear no malice towards them and have no wish for retribution.\\" Norman Kember said that if he did testify, it would likely be only to plea for clemency on behalf of their captors.Campbell, D. (2006.) \\"Former Iraq hostages refuse to give evidence against captors in trial\\". The Guardian UK. Retrieved December 9, 2006. Years later, the kidnappers were arrested by the Iraqi police, but Kember still refused to testify.  Books published on crisis  On March 23, 2007, one year after the release of the three hostages, Norman Kember published Hostage in Iraq.We must take risks for peace, says Norman Kember, Ekklesia News Service, March 10, 2007 Published by Darton Longman and Todd, it told the story of his captivity and included previously unseen drawings and notes made by Norman Kember, who during his captivity invented games with his fellow captives. On June 5, 2008, Christian Peacemaker Teams published a collection of essays by those involved in the crisis including Kember, Sooden and Loney.Christian Peacemaker Teams announces publication of \\"118 Days,\\" book detailing Iraq hostage crisis, Christian Peacemaker Teams Press Release The book was initially self-published after two different religious publishing houses insisted on changes to a chapter written by Dan Hunt, Loney's same-sex partner.\\"Why We Self-Published,\\" 118 Days: Christian Peacemaker Teams Held Hostage in Iraq, ed. Tricia Gates Brown The book is now available from Cascadia Publishing House. It examines the events surrounding the captivity from multiple points of view, including CPT members who remained in Baghdad during the crisis; members working on other teams (Palestine, Colombia, the Chicago and Toronto offices); friends, supporters and family members of the hostages. Knopf Canada published a book written by James Loney in the spring of 2011.  Timeline of the crisis  ;November 26: The hostages are abducted. ;November 29: Al Jazeera broadcasts a video from \\"Swords of Righteousness Brigade\\" showing hostages and issuing demands. ;December 3: The Iraq Islamic Party, the main Sunni political party in Iraq, called for the release of the hostages. ;December 5: An online petition calling for the release of the hostages was signed by more than 13000 people, including Noam Chomsky and Arundhati Roy. ;December 6: Another video was released, in which the hostages gave assurances that they were being well-treated. In the video, Sooden and Loney are shown unshackled and eating, while Fox and Kember appear handcuffed. Kember requests that Tony Blair withdraw all British troops from Iraq. :On the same day, Ehab Lotayef, a representative of the Canadian Islamic Congress, left Canada for Baghdad (he arrived in Iraq on December 9 and broadcast televised appeals to the kidnappers, stating that Christian Peacemakers had always been supportive of human rights for Arabs in Iraq and Palestine). As well, Tom Fox's daughter Katherine appeared on ABC's Nightline to plead for his release. ;December 7: An additional plea for the hostages' release was made by the radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada, from a British jail. :Later the same day, another video was released by the kidnappers, in which they extended the deadline for their demands to Saturday, December 10. This video featured only Fox and Kember, clad in orange jumpsuits reminiscent of those worn by detainees in photos from Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. Some commentators, such as BBC correspondent Caroline Hawley, speculated that Loney and Sooden may have been treated differently than Fox and Kember, as the former two are both Canadians, and Canada did not support the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This speculation was based on the apparent differences in the treatment of the hostages in the second video (in which only Fox and Kember are shackled) and the third (in which only Fox and Kember appear). ;December 9: Former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg called for the hostages' release, stating that the orange boiler suits worn by the hostages reminded him of his own imprisonment. Terry Waite also pleaded for Kember's release, however he added that he disputed the Christian Peacemakers' tactic of going into a \\"highly polarised\\" situation in Iraq. The same day, a plea was made by Mohammed Mahdi Akef, president of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. ;December 10: The second deadline passed on the afternoon of December 10, with no information from the Brigade about the status of the hostages. Fox's daughter issued a statement saying that she and her father believe the Iraqi people have legitimate grievances about the U.S. occupation, but \\"these grievances, however, will not be resolved by taking my father's life.\\" As well, prominent American antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan called for the hostages' release in a rally in London. ;December 12: Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor sent his regards and a message of support to a vigil being held in Trafalgar Square, saying that he too prayed for their release, and closed stating \\"I plead with their captors to have mercy, as God is merciful, and to release them.\\" ;December 16: The Toronto Star reported that a confidential source has stated that an unnamed Iraqi hostage negotiator who had allegedly made contact with the kidnappers had himself been abducted. Later that day, Ekklesia reported these claims were unfounded, and that there was no such negotiator. ;December 25: The families of the hostages placed advertisements in many Iraqi newspapers, repeating previous pleas by prominent Muslims for their release. ;January 4: Christian Peacemaker Teams announced that some of its members would hold a public Epiphany fast in Lafayette Park outside the White House from January 6 to January 9, or until they were granted a meeting with President Bush. ;January 7: Al Jazeera ran an interview with a friend of Tom Fox, using a headline emphasising the situation as ongoing. ;January 28: Al Jazeera broadcast a video dated January 21, showing the four hostages. The video appeared with a statement from the captors offering US authorities a \\"last chance\\" to \\"release all Iraqi prisoners in return of freeing the hostages otherwise their fate will be death.\\" ;February 20: Newly appointed Canadian foreign-affairs minister Peter MacKay drew criticism after telling reporters he is confident the hostages will be released. He later apologized to the families of the hostages for his speculation, saying he had no new information. ;March 7: Al Jazeera broadcast a new video, dated to 28 February. It showed Kember, Loney, and Sooden talking into the camera, but it had no sound and contains no demands by the kidnappers. All three were shown alert and apparently well; Tom Fox was not shown. Rebecca Johnson, spokeswoman for CPT, stated that public speculation on the reasons for Fox's absence was \\"unhelpful\\". ;March 10: The U.S. State Department announced that the body of Tom Fox was found in Iraq. ;March 23: News outlets reported at the time that the three remaining hostages are freed in a British-led operation by a multinational force consisting of American and British coalition forces as well as Iraqi forces, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and possibly Canadian military personnel. The identity and extent of the Canadian military contribution and the nature of its participation, if any, are unknown. There were unconfirmed reports and speculation that elements of the Canadian special-operations unit Joint Task Force 2 were involved.

Jones's novelette \\"Stay Off the Moon!\\" was the cover story on the December 1962 issue of Amazing Stories. Raymond Fisher Jones (15 November 1915 - 24 January 1994) was an American science fiction author. He is best known for his 1952 novel This Island Earth, which was adapted into the eponymous 1955 film. Personal life Jones was born at Salt Lake City, Utah, and was a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from birth. He died at Sandy, Utah, in 1994. Career Most of Jones' short fiction was published during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, in magazines such as Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Stories, and Galaxy. His sixteen novels were published between 1951 and 1978. His short story \\"Rat Race\\", first published in the April 1966 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact, was nominated for a Hugo Award.

Scruggs first came to the public eye after successfully suing the asbestos industry on behalf of ill shipyard workers. He later represented the state of Mississippi in the tobacco litigation of the 1990s. He also represented hundreds of homeowners in lawsuits against insurance companies following Hurricane Katrina, and a national class action of patients against HMOs in the early 2000s. Scruggs' legal career was derailed by his indictment in a judicial bribery scheme in 2007. Scruggs pled guilty to conspiracy to bribe Circuit Judge Henry L. Lackey in 2008. He also entered a 2009 guilty plea for a scheme to influence Circuit Judge Bobby DeLaughter. Scruggs was sentenced to five years in prison on June 27, 2008, by U.S. District Judge Neal Biggers; and on February 10, 2009, Judge Glen H. Davidson sentenced him to seven years for the second scheme, to run concurrently. He served six years in federal prison and was released in 2014. Kings of Tort, by Alan Lange and Tom Dawson, released in 2009, documents the rise and fall of Scruggs. The Fall of the House of Zeus: The Rise and Ruin of America's Most Powerful Trial Lawyer, by veteran journalist Curtis Wilkie, was published in 2010. Personal life Scruggs was born in Brookhaven, Mississippi, on May 17, 1946, but grew up in Pascagoula, Mississippi. He told Time that his father left the family when Scruggs was five years old. Scruggs was then raised by his mother, Helen, who worked as a legal secretary at the Ingalls shipyard. She was also an alumnus of Millsaps College. In 1971 he married Diane Thompson, a sister of Tricia Thompson Lott, wife of Trent Lott. The sisters are close, and their families often spent holidays together. Scruggs lived in a five-million-dollar mansion in Oxford, Mississippi. In 2003, he bought the upper floor of a building on Courthouse Square in Oxford in which he housed the Scruggs Law Firm. In 2010, the space was purchased by the firm of W. Roberts Wilson, Jr. following the 2009 settlement of Wilson's longstanding suit against Scruggs for fees resulting from asbestos cases in the 1980s. Scruggs and his wife, Diane, were ardent supporters of the University of Mississippi and made large donations to several organizations on campus. Scruggs Hall, which currently houses the music department, was named in their honor. The Scruggs name was removed from the building following Scruggs guilty plea to bribery in March 2007. The building is now called \\"The Music Building\\". John Grisham reported that Scruggs, while serving his sentence in federal prison, worked to help inmates get GED certificates, and expressed astonishment at the low level of literacy among the inmates. Scruggs took long walks with other white-collar inmates.Federal Bureau of Prisons Inmate Locator for Richard F. Scruggs, retrieved 2009-8-3. He taught nonviolent offenders, many who were imprisoned on drug charges, helping them to acquire their GEDs, and nearly 60 students under his tutelage graduated. Scruggs has partnered with the Mississippi Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training program (MIBEST), which provides a remedial education and marketable skills to students seeking a GED. Education and military career Scruggs was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon as an undergraduate at the University of Mississippi. Upon graduation and commissioning as a naval officer, Scruggs entered flight training and earned his wings as an A6 bomber pilot in 1970. Scruggs was assigned to an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean Sea during the Arab–Israeli conflict of October 1973, where he was stationed aboard the carrier Franklin D. Roosevelt during the nuclear alert triggered by the Soviet threat to intervene in the Arab–Israeli War. He graduated from the University of Mississippi Law School in 1976, where he was a classmate of Mike Moore, a close friend who later became the attorney general of Mississippi. Political activity Scruggs has made monetary contributions to the presidential campaigns of Joe Biden and John McCain; the senatorial campaigns of Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Biden, and McCain; and to numerous other candidates from both major political parties.Federal Election Committee Contribution Receipt http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?27990286979 He also reportedly contributed to Tom Daschle, Susan Collins, and Harry Reid. Scruggs was scheduled to host a fundraiser at his home for Senator Clinton's presidential campaign, on December 15, 2007, to be attended by former President Bill Clinton. However, that fundraiser was canceled after Scruggs' indictment. In the months following Scruggs' indictment, both the McCain and the Biden campaigns returned his contributions. Legal career Scruggs began his career with a prestigious law firm in Jackson, Mississippi, where he often defended insurance companies. Later he moved back to Pascagoula and opened his own office. =Asbestos litigation= One of his first big legal victories was in representing workers at the Pascagoula shipyard who became fatally ill as a result of exposure to asbestos fibers. He encountered his first client in 1984 when he was approached by a shipyard worker looking for help with a lung disease. Scruggs paid for the client's medical tests which revealed the medical ailment to be asbestosis. Scruggs took on 4200 direct clients and served as co-counsel to another 6000. =Tobacco litigation= In the 1990s, Scruggs was hired by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore to assist with a lawsuit against thirteen tobacco companies for state-borne health care costs. Scruggs and his colleagues brought a concerted action, representing several states, which resulted in a settlement of over $248 billion. His performance in this case was portrayed by actor Colm Feore in the movie The Insider.Full cast and crew for The Insider (1999), IMDB, retrieved 2007-12-7 Scruggs himself, as well as his second house in Pascagoula, Mississippi, also appeared in the film. In total, Scruggs' firm Scruggs, Millette, Bozeman and Dent earned about $900 million in legal fees from the judgments, with about one third going to Scruggs. The total in fees Scruggs received resulted in public controversy regarding the amount that lawyers are allowed to take from large settlements. Scruggs stated that his firm held a reserve to help challenge future cases and cover costs, allowing additional financial leverage in addressing the legal infractions of major corporations. =Ritalin lawsuits/medical care litigation= A short time after the tobacco lawsuit, Scruggs led and became a spokesman for the plaintiffs in the Ritalin class action lawsuits. He asserted that the makers of Ritalin \\"manufactured a disease\\" and that Ritalin \\"has been grossly over-prescribed. It is a huge risk.\\" Following a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court stating that HMOs could be sued, as opposed to only doctors, Scruggs led a new set of lawsuits against American HMOs. In June 2004, Scruggs also led a lawsuit against 13 non-profit hospital groups, alleging they hoarded funds gained from tax breaks while dispensing inadequate care. All five class actions in five states were dismissed before trial. =Katrina litigation= In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Scruggs filed a number of lawsuits against insurance companies regarding payment on claims made for storm damage. One of his clients was his brother-in-law Senator Trent Lott, former Majority Leader of the US Senate and Lott's wife, Tricia, in a lawsuit against State Farm Insurance. Numerous other clients and cases followed, most of which resulted in favorable settlements; however, Scruggs eventually dropped the Lott case following his indictment and disqualification. =Other litigation= In 2003, Scruggs tried and won a national class action against Lehman Brothers, with a verdict of $51 million for financing a predatory lending scheme. =Bribery and wire fraud= At the conclusion of one of those Katrina-related trials, a fee dispute arose between Scruggs and other plaintiff's attorneys involved in the case. That fee dispute resulted in a separate trial to determine how to apportion the fees. According to allegations that later surfaced in a criminal prosecution, Scruggs was involved in an attempt to bribe Mississippi Third Circuit Court Judge Henry L. Lackey with $40,000 in exchange for a favorable ruling in the fee dispute. Lackey had contacted the local U.S. Attorney’s office about an improper communication from a third party associated with Scruggs, and at the U.S. Attorney’s request, Lackey solicited a bribe of $40,000 through the third party. Scruggs, who was later recorded saying he would “take care of” what he was told was a request from the judge for an additional payment, pleaded guilty in Federal Court on March 14, 2008. On June 26, 2008, he was sentenced to five years in prison for the bribery charge. In a separate federal indictment, Scruggs was accused of attempting to improperly influence Mississippi judge Bobby DeLaughter. On February 10, 2009, Scruggs pleaded guilty in federal court in Aberdeen, Mississippi, to one count of that indictment charging mail fraud in the corruption of a public official. Scruggs was sentenced to a seven-year term to run concurrently with the five-year sentence, adding two years to the total (the maximum penalty was 20 years/$250,000 fine). He was also fined $100,000. Judge Glen H. Davidson imposed his sentence and quoted the Scottish philosopher William Barclay: \\"The Romans had a proverb that money was like sea water. The more you drink the thirstier you become.\\" The conviction also resulted in Scruggs Hall, which housed the Music department of the University of Mississippi, to be renamed \\"The Music Building\\". In December 2012, a federal judge granted Scruggs' motion to be released from prison on bail pending his appeal of the 2009 conviction. The appeal was unsuccessful and Scruggs returned to jail in April 2013 to complete his sentence. Scruggs was released from jail and placed under house arrest on March 20, 2014. His sentence was completed on September 14, 2014.

Europe  As animals native to Europe and Africa, hedgehogs hold a place in European folklore.. English abstract also available separately. In most European countries, hedgehogs are believed to be a hard-working no-nonsense animal. This partially results from the folk belief that hedgehogs collect apples and mushrooms and carry them to their secret storage. It is unclear exactly how old this belief is, though the Roman author Pliny the Elder mentions hedgehogs gathering grapes by this method in his Naturalis Historia. In medieval bestiaries and other illuminated manuscripts dating from at least the 13th century onwards, hedgehogs are shown rolling on and impaling fruit to carry back to their dens. In fact, however, hedgehogs do not gather food to store for later consumption, relying on their deposited fat to survive hibernation. Nor is apple included in their usual diet (it has been suggested, however, that the hedgehogs may use juice of wild apples in order to get rid of parasites, similar to anting). The image remains an irresistible one to modern illustrators. Therefore, hedgehogs are often portrayed carrying apples – partially, to make them look cuter. Hedgehogs are often pictured as fond of milk; as late as the 19th century, some English villagers even believed that these creatures would suck milk out of cows' udders.\\"Hedgehogs\\" in: In reality, however, hedgehogs are lactose-intolerant. Hedgehogs are also often seen in pictures with an autumn-themed background, since the animal hibernates in piles of leaves. This also adds to the cute reputation of hedgehogs. In Great Britain, however, the human habit of lighting bonfires to celebrate Bonfire Night on 5 November has led to an increased risk to hedgehogs, who often choose to sleep in the piles of wood accumulated in gardens and parks beforehand. Television messages now remind viewers who might be lighting bonfires to check them first for the presence of hibernating hedgehogs. During the 1970s and 1980s, hedgehogs were one of the poster animals for environment activists through Europe. A lot of hedgehogs were killed by traffic, and since the hedgehog already had an aura of a cute little friendly animal, the choice was nearly perfect. In a Veps legend, the (female) hedgehog appears in a creation myth. According to it, early on, there was no dry land; the entire world was just a big lake. It was a giant hedgehog who brought soil and sand with its needles, creating dry land. A hedgehog plays a role in a Lithuanian and Latvian creation story as well: when God made heaven and earth, he did not take good measurements, so the earth was made larger than the heaven; on the hedgehog's wise suggestion, God squeezed the earth, so that it would fit into the heaven. (In some version of the legend, the process of \\"shrinking\\" the earth resulted in the creation of mountain ranges). To reward the clever hedgehog, God equipped him with a suite of needles. A similar legend is attested among the Banat Bulgarians and among Romanians as well. , quoted in: Tales From The Past – Folklore, Fairy Tales, Mythology and Magic The wisdom of the hedgehog is presented in other folk legend in the Balkans as well. In a Bulgarian legend, the Sun decided to marry the Moon, and invited all the animals to the wedding. The hedgehog was the only one who failed to appear. The Sun went to look for the hedgehog, and found him gnawing on a stone. When the Sun inquired what he was doing, the hedgehog explained: \\"I am learning to eat stones. Once you marry, you'll have many Sun children born to you, and when they all shine in the sky, everything will burn, and there will be nothing to eat\\". The Sun then decided to call off the wedding, and the world's inhabitants were saved from starvation.One version of this story, called СОНЧЕВАТА ЖЕНИДБА (The Sun's Wedding), was collected by Marko Cepenkov in the 19th century, in what is today North Macedonia; in it, the hedgehog (who rides a donkey) offers stones to his donkey to eat. In another version of the story, it is a tortoise rather than a hedgehog who warns the sun about the consequences of the wedding; in yet another version, it is an old man who offers a piece of quartz to his donkey. These other two versions can be found e.g. in Predanija i Legendi, ed. Kiril Penuševski, Skopje, 1969. In the Balkan Slavic and Belarusian folklore, the wise hedgehog (along with the tortoise) sometimes appears as the animal capable of finding the raskovnik, a magic plant that could be used to open locks and to find hidden treasures. \\"Raskovnik\\" (Расковник) in: In a number of Balkan (Bulgarian, Macedonian, Song no. 28 (\\"Свадба отъ ракови-те' [Lobsers' Wedding]) in the Bulgarian Folk Songs. Edited by the Miladinov brothers. Zagreb, 1861. Greek, based on Song no. 195 from Panagiotis Aravantinos' \\"Συλλογή δημωδών ασμάτων της Ηπείρου\\" (Athens, 1880)) folk songs the (male) hedgehog often appears romantically interested in a (female) tortoise. His advances are usually unwelcome, the tortoises often resorting to legal means to deal with the harasser.  United States  The common American holiday Groundhog Day originated in Ancient Rome as Hedgehog Day and is still celebrated as such through much of the world. There are no native hedgehogs in the United States, so the early settlers chose the groundhog as a substitute. Hedgehogs remain largely unseen in modern-day American culture. On a number of occasions British educational programs have been revoiced to refer to hedgehogs as porcupines (at least one of such examples being Bob the Builder). The Wacky Wheels video game makes humorous use of hedgehogs as projectiles, and they are also seen reading the newspaper while sitting on the toilet in the middle of the race course. One notable exception is Sonic the Hedgehog, the video game character created by SEGA. May has been designated Hedgehog Month by the International Hedgehog Association.  Oceania  New Zealand's McGillicuddy Serious Party were unsuccessful in their attempt to get a hedgehog elected to Parliament. Also in New Zealand, hedgehogs feature in the Bogor cartoon by Burton Silver, via which they also appeared on a postage stamp.  Technology  A hedgehog transformer is an early type of electrical transformer designed to work at audio frequencies (AF). They resemble hedgehogs in size, color and shape, and were used in the first part of the 20th century. (See http://www.telephonecollecting.org/hedgehog.html)  Cuisine  Pork hedgehogs, with slivered almond quills In some supermarkets in the UK, a type of speciality loaf named Hedgehog Bread can be found for sale. The loaf has a hard top crust shaped before baking into a series of small spikes, resembling a hedgehog. A \\"hedgehog cake\\" recipe appears in English cookbooks as early as the 18th century. \\"Hedgehogs\\" may also be created by moulding ground meat in a teardrop shape, embedding pastry slivers or slivered almonds in the surface to resemble quills, and adding eyes and ears of peppercorns, olives, or whole almonds. The technique dates back to at least 1390,\\"The Forme of Cury, A Roll of Ancient English Cookery, Compiled, about A.D. 1390, by the Master-Cooks of King Richard II, Presented afterwards to Queen Elizabeth, by Edward Lord Stafford\\", contains a recipe for sausages \\"made after an urchoun [i.e., hedgehog] withoute legges\\" with \\"smale prikkes of gode past [pastry]\\". http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Forme-of-Cury2.html and was referenced in an episode of Two Fat Ladies.  Hedgehogs in popular culture  = In books = * In Good to Great by James C. Collins, he describes a fundamental attribute of successful businesses as their \\"Hedgehog Concept\\". * Hans My Hedgehog is a German fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm. A wealthy but childless merchant wishes he had a child, even a hedgehog, and comes home to find that his wife has given birth to a baby boy that is a hedgehog from the waist up. After many trials Hans My Hedgehog marries a princess and becomes a handsome young man. An even more popular tale in this collection, The Hare and the Hedgehog, is about the race between a hare, who is proud of his swift legs, and a hedgehog. The hedgehog teams up with his wife who hides on the other side of the field across which the hare and the hedgehog are to race. The hedgehog does not race all the way but simply cowers in his furrow after a few steps.

Each movement is denoted by the tempo marking, as the individual movements are untitled. Background Bernard de Nevers, the head of the composer's then publisher Alfred Lengnick & Co. asked Arnold to write a suite of dances akin to Antonín Dvořák's Slavonic Dances. This resulted in the first set. The set was premiered on 14 April 1951 by the London Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Adrian Boult. After the success of the first set, de Nevers asked for a second set, which the composer completed the following year. The second set was premiered on 5 August 1952 at the Royal Albert Hall with the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent. The first movement of the second set, Allegro non troppo, was used from 1969 to 2008 as the theme music for the long-running UK television programme What the Papers Say, and was used again for the revived version of the programme on BBC Radio Four. Shades and passages of the third movement of the first set, Mesto, are recognisable in the main title of Maurice Jarre's Oscar-winning music for David Lean's 1965 film Doctor Zhivago.

The Unionist Party mainly represented the interests of the landed gentry and landlords of Punjab, which included Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. The Unionists dominated the political scene in Punjab from World War I to the independence of India and Pakistan (and the partition of the province) in 1947. The party's leaders served as Prime Minister of the Punjab. The creed of the Unionist Party emphasized: \\"Dominion Status and a United Democratic federal constitution for India as a whole\\". Organisation The Unionist Party, a secular party, was formed to represent the interests of Punjab's large feudal classes and gentry. Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, Sir Fazli Husain, Sir Shahab-ud-Din, and Sir Chhotu Ram were the co- founders of the party. Although a majority of Unionists were Muslims, a large number of Hindus and Sikhs also supported and participated in the Unionist Party. In contrast with the Indian National Congress and many other parties of the time, the Unionist Party did not have a mass-based approach. Also, in contrast with the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League, the Unionists supported the British Raj, and contested elections for the Punjab Legislative Council and the central Legislative Council at a time when the Congress and the Muslim League were boycotting them. As a result, the Unionist Party dominated the provincial legislature for a number of years, allowing an elected provincial government to function when other provinces were governed by direct rule. Relations with other political parties Sir Sikander Hayat Khan In the 1937 Indian provincial elections, the Unionist Party soundly defeated the Muslim League in the Punjab. The Muslim elements of the Unionists shared many common points with the Muslim League and followed a rather similar policy and agenda for national interests and issues;Prof. Stanley Wolpert, \\"Jinnah of Pakistan\\", Karachi:Oxford UP, 1999 reprint, pp. 150-151 but the Unionists were virtually an independent political party in the 1920s and 1930s, when the Muslim League was unpopular and divided into feuding factions. The links improved after Muhammad Ali Jinnah became the League's president in the mid-1930s and by October 1937, and then he was able to convince Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan to come to terms with him via the famous Sikandar-Jinnah Pact.Wolpert, p.151 However, the rule of Unionist leader Sir Sikandar remained undisputed in the Punjab and he remained the Punjab's Premier (Chief Minister) from 1937 to 1942, in alliance with the Indian National Congress and the Shiromani Akali Dal despite Jinnah's opposition to both parties. Sir Sikandar thus remained the most popular and influential politician in Punjab during his lifetime, preventing both Jinnah and Sir Muhammad Iqbal from gaining the support of a majority of Punjabi Muslims. Decline After the death of Khan in 1942, the party gradually collapsed. Jinnah and his pro-separatist Muslim League demanded of the new leader, Khizar Hayat Khan Tiwana, that the word \\"Muslim\\" be incorporated into the party name. Tiwana, however, refused to alienate his Hindu and Sikh supporters, and was opposed to the partition of India. As a result, the pro-separatist Muslim League sought to intimidate Tiwana. The Muslim League's Direct Action Day campaign brought the downfall of Sir Khizar's ministry, which depended on Congress and Akali support; inter- community relations were effectively destroyed as communal violence across India claimed the lives of tens of thousands of people. With the partition of India in August 1947 into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, Punjab was itself partitioned between the two new countries, with the Muslim majority West Punjab forming part of Pakistan, and the Hindu-Sikh majority East Punjab forming part of independent India. The Unionist Party's diverse pan-provincial organisation was destroyed, with some Muslim Unionists integrating themselves into the Muslim League; the party ceased to exist in independent India and Pakistan. Legacy In Sindh Province, a Sind United Party modelled on the lines of the Punjab Unionists and representing similar interests. It became the largest party in the province at the 1937 provincial election. In 2013, guar farmers in Rajasthan formed the National Unionist Zamindara Party (or Zamindara Party) to represent their interests. While there is no connection to the historic Punjab Unionists, the new party honours the legacy of Unionist leaders like Sir Chhotu Ram.Guar farmers plan own party in Rajasthan The party was successful in winning 2 seats in the 2013 state election.

His work is often coupled with that of Lucie Rie due to their close association, even though their best known work differs dramatically, with Rie's being less sculptural, while Coper's was much more abstract, but also always functional. The latter point was noted by M. S. Thomas in his recent book \\"The Essential Potness.\\" Coper always made functional vessels, principally containers for flowers (vases), fruit (bowls), candles (candle holders) including work for Coventry Cathedral and Sussex University meeting house. He made a small group of Figures in the fifties, which were not vessels and were never put on sale (see Tony Birks).  Biography  Coper was born in Chemnitz, Germany, and fled to Britain in 1939. He was interned as an enemy alien, and held in Canada for two years; on return to Britain in 1942, he served as a conscientious objector in the Non-Combatant Corps. In 1946, with no previous experience in ceramics, he began working as an assistant in the studio of Lucie Rie. It is from this time you will find tea sets and cups and saucers made by both Rie and Coper. By the time he left in 1958 to establish his own studio at Digswell House in Hertfordshire, he was already well known as a potter in his own right, experimenting with much more abstract forms that were at the time considered very ahead of their time. Because of the success of his work, he went on to become a leading figure in the 20th century studio pottery movement. Throughout the 1960s he taught pottery at the Camberwell School of Art and the Royal College of Art. He died in Frome, Somerset in 1981 of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Coper would characteristically throw his work on the potter's wheel, then alter and assemble pieces by hand to achieve the finished form. Thus, although made on the wheel, his work has a sculptural quality, but is always functional. The surfaces of his pots tend to be roughly textured and coloured with oxides, especially manganese oxide. His distinctive pots take on recognizable \\"forms\\" he termed Spade, Bud, Cup, Egg, Flower and Arrow. Coper's work was widely exhibited and collected even in his lifetime. Today, it is found in the collections of major museums around the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, Museum de Fundatie, the Sainsbury Centre in Norwich UK, and York Art Gallery, as well as in private collections worldwide. Among his best known works is the set of three 7-foot candlesticks on the high altar at Coventry Cathedral, commissioned in 1962.British Council - Visual Arts: Hans Coper References  Bibliography  # Birks, Tony.

It claims to be India's largest student organisation with more than three million members. History The ABVP, founded in 1948 with the initiative of the RSS activist Balraj Madhok, was formally registered on 9 July 1949. Its primary purpose was to counter communist influences on university campuses. Yashwant Rao Kelkar, a lecturer in Bombay, became its main organiser in 1958. According to the ABVP website, he built the organisation into what it is now and is considered to be 'the real architect of the ABVP'. Various branches of the ABVP have been involved in Hindu-Muslim communal riots since 1961. However, in the 1970s, the ABVP also increasingly took on issues concerning the lower middle classes like corruption and government inertia that were also being taken on by communist student groups. The ABVP played a leading role in the agitational politics of the 1970s during the JP Movement. This led to collaboration among student activists in Gujarat and Bihar. The ABVP gained significantly from such efforts after the Emergency and experienced a growth in membership. By 1974, the ABVP had 160,000 members across 790 campuses and had gained control over several prominent universities, including University of Delhi via student elections. By 1983, the organisation had 250,000 members and 1,100 branches. ABVP grew during the 1990s, receiving more support as a result of the Babri Masjid demolition and the economic liberalisation pursued by the P. V. Narasimharao government. It continued to grow after the United Progressive Alliance came to power in 2003, trebling in membership to 3.175 million members as of 2016. It claims to be India's largest student organisation.  Links to the Bharatiya Janata Party  The ABVP spokesmen insist that the ABVP is not affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). They describe it the \\"student wing\\" of the RSS.Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad is not the students' wing of BJP: Shreehari Borikar, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad web site, retrieved 22 April 2018. However, both the BJP and the ABVP are members of the Sangh Parivar, the RSS's \\"family of (affiliated) organisations\\". The BJP is said to gain handsomely from the ABVP's support base and several politicians of the BJP, including the former Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, had their ideological foundation in the ABVP.Atul Chandra, A string of losses on campuses across India: Is the ABVP losing its appeal among students?, Catch News, 29 November 2017. Several scholars make no distinction between the RSS and the BJP, and regard the ABVP as a student wing of both of them or either of them. : \\"Protests and lathi-charges continued throughout January, the former organised by a transitory student organisation...although the role of the BJP-affiliated ABVP student union seems to have been more conspicuous.\\": \\"Thus, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), currently in power in India, demanded the removal of an essay by A.

They included not only Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University and Delhi University, but also the Allahabad University and Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapeeth in Uttar Pradesh, the Gujarat University and the Gauhati University. The loss in the Kashi Vidyapeeth was considered especially significant since it is in Varanasi, the prime minister Narendra Modi's home constituency. This is said to have caused alarm in the BJP, which set up a committee to study the issues causing the ABVP's decline.ABVP loses student union polls on PM Modi turf, The Times of India, 5 November 2017. ABVP was able to resurge in the year 2018 by winning the key posts of president, vice- president and joint secretary of students polls of Delhi university. ABVP won all the six seats in the Hyderabad Central University students union polls after eight years Activities The ABVP's manifesto includes agendas such as educational and university reforms. It competes in student-body elections in colleges and universities. Students for Development (SFD) is an initiative by the ABVP to promote \\"right perspective towards the need of holistic and sustainable development\\" in students.

In some cases, members of the ABVP have been behind property destruction, while they were involved in violence in other cases, even leading to the victims' deaths in some cases. * 5, January 2020: According to the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union, masked ABVP members attacked JNU students, smashing cars and pelted stones, while ABVP accused the left wing organisations. ABVP later confessed the same on national media and in a sting operation, and also the veracity of ABVP's involvement was found out through investigative journalism which was later confirmed by Delhi Police.

History  Because of the general illiteracy of the populace, early store owners used descriptive emblems or figures to advertise their shops' wares; for example, barber poles advertise barber shops, show globes advertised apothecaries and the three gold balls represent pawn shops. American Indians and tobacco had always been associated because American Indians introduced tobacco to Europeans, and the depiction of native people on smoke-shop signs was almost inevitable. As early as the 17th century, European tobacconists used figures of American Indians to advertise their shops. In 1667, King Charles II passed a law which forbade the use of overhead projecting signs because of the danger presented to passing traffic. A Highlander figure indicated the sale of Scottish snuff, and a Blackamoor figure that tobacco from the Caribbean was available.https://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68301/general-view-of-a- victorian-tobacconist Because European carvers had never seen a Native American, these early cigar-store \\"Indians\\" looked more like Africans with feathered headdresses and other fanciful, exotic features. These carvings were called \\"Black Boys\\" or \\"Virginians\\" in the trade. Eventually, the European cigar-store figure began to take on a more \\"authentic\\" yet highly stylized native visage, and by the time the smoke-shop figure arrived in the Americas in the late 18th century, it had become thoroughly \\"Indian.\\"  Today  The cigar store Indian became less common in the 20th century for a variety of reasons. Sidewalk-obstruction laws dating as far back as 1911 were one cause. Later issues included higher manufacturing costs, restrictions on tobacco advertising, and increased sensitivity towards depictions of Native Americans, all of which relegated the figures to museums and antique shops. Many also were destroyed during scrap drives for metal and wood during World War I and World War II. Cigar store figures are now viewed as folk art, and some models have become collector's items, drawing prices up to $500,000. Modern replicas of cigar store Indians are still made for sale, some as cheap as $600. People within the Native American community often view such likenesses as offensive for several reasons. Some objections are because they are used to promote tobacco use as recreational instead of ceremonial. Other objections are that they perpetuate a \\"noble savage\\" or \\"Indian princess\\" caricature or inauthentic stereotypes of Native people, implying that modern individuals \\"are still living in tepees, that we still wear war bonnets and beads.\\" drawing parallels to the African-American lawn jockey.

Prior to its NOAA career, it was in commission in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey from 1967 to 1970 as USC&GS; Rude (ASV 90). It was named for Gilbert T. Rude, former Chief of the Division of Coastal Surveys of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. In 2008, NOAA decommissioned Rude and transferred it to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Renamed R/V Lake Explorer II, it entered EPA service as a research ship in 2009.  USC&GS; and NOAA =Construction and commissioning= Rude (pronounced \\"Rudy\\") was built as an \\"auxiliary survey vessel\\" (ASV) for the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey at the Jackobson Shipyard in Oyster Bay, New York. It was launched on 17 August 1966Polmar, Norman, The Naval Institute Guide to the Ships and Aircraft of the U.S. Fleet, Seventeenth Edition, Naval Institute Press: Annapolis, Maryland, 2001, , p. 617. and commissioned into Coast and Geodetic Survey service on 29 March 1967 as USC&GS; Rude (ASV 90).Silverstone, Paul H., The Navy of the Nuclear Age 1947-2007, New York: Routledge, 2009, , p. 314. When the Coast and Geodetic Survey merged with other United States Government organizations to form NOAA on 3 October 1970, it became a part of the NOAA fleet as NOAAS Rude (S 590). =Technical details= A United States Coast and Geodetic Survey diagram of ca. 1920 of wire-drag hydrographic survey operations as carried out by Rude and its sister ship NOAAS Heck (S 591).. The basic principle is to drag a wire attached to two vessels; if the wire encounters an obstruction it will come taut and form a \\"V.\\"Rude (left) worked with its sister ship NOAAS Heck (S 591) (right) on wire drag operations until 1989.Rude′s hull was 90 feet (27.4 m) long, the smallest in the NOAA fleet. It had a total of 11 bunk spaces. The ship's mess room could seat seven. It carried a complement of four NOAA Corps officers and seven other crew members, including one licensed engineer. Rude′s deck equipment featured one winch and one telescoping boom crane. This equipment gave Rude a lifting capacity of up to 7,500 pounds (3,400 kg). It also had 500 feet (152 meters) of cable that could pull up to 250 pounds (113 kg). For its primary mission of inshore hydrographic surveys, Rude had a differential global positioning system (DGPS), a multibeam sonar system, and side-scan sonar (SSS). It also was equipped for diving operations to allow human investigation of submerged obstacles. It had a 19-foot (5.7 m) fiberglass launch for utility or rescue operations. =Operations= The Coast and Geodetic Survey acquired Rude and a sister ship of identical design, USC&GS; Heck (ASV 91), later NOAAS Heck (S 591) to conduct wire-drag survey operations together, replacing the survey ships USC&GS; Hilgard (ASV 82) and USC&GS; Wainwright (ASV 83) in that role. Like Hilgard and Wainright before them, Rude and Heck worked together under a single command conducting wire drag surveys, clearing large swaths between them with a submerged wire. In 1978, Rude and Heck came to the assistance of the burning research vessel Midnight Sun, rescuing Midnight Sun′s crew and scientists and saving the vessel from total loss. Rude′s crew took aboard all 20 of Midnight Suns crew members and scientists, who were afloat in life rafts near Midnight Sun, administered first aid to them, and transported them to shore. Hecks crew, meanwhile, fought the fire aboard Midnight Sun for 20 consecutive hours and saved Midnight Sun from sinking. For their efforts in saving Midnight Sun and its crew, the crews of Rude and Heck received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal in 1978.NOAA History: Hall of Honor: Commerce Medals Presented For Lifesaving and the Protection of Property 1955-2000 Electronic technologies eventually arrived that allow a single vessel to do the same surveying work using sidescan and multibeam sonar that formerly required two vessels working together using the wire-drag technique. In 1989, Rude and Heck began working independently thanks to the improved technology, and Heck was decommissioned in 1995 and sold in 2001. Rude remained in commission and was sometimes called upon to assist the United States Coast Guard and United States Navy in search, rescue, and recovery operations. It located the wreckage of TWA Flight 800 off Moriches, New York in 1996, receiving a Department of Commerce Gold Medal that year for its efforts, and later located the plane wreckage of John F.

The EPA renamed it R/V Lake Explorer II and earmarked it for environmental research operations on the Great Lakes. =Conversion= R/V Lake Explorer II in 2008 or 2009.After acquiring Lake Explorer II, the EPA converted it for use as a research vessel. The EPA retained all of the ship′s navigation equipment, its A-frame, and its accommodations of 11 bunks located in four double stateroom and one triple stateroom. However, the EPA removed all of its NOAA science equipment and installed new equipment appropriate to its new environmental research role, including a winch and an additional frame. On 22 September 2008, while Lake Explorer II was moored in the Elizabeth River at the NOAA Marine Operations Base at Norfolk, still without its new name painted on its side, it suffered a fracture in a stern tube which ran through its center fuel tank, causing it to spill an estimated 1,400 U.S. gallons (5,300 liters) of diesel fuel into the river.Anonymous, \\"Coast Guard responds to diesel spill in Norfolk, Va.,\\" Coast Guard News, September 22, 2008 Retrieved August 20, 2018Anonymous, \\"Environmental Protection Agency Operated Vessel Spills 1,400 Gallons of Diesel at NOAA Operating Base,\\" The Maritime Executive, undated Retrieved August 20, 2018 Its crew contained the leak, and a combined effort by the U.S. Coast Guard, Norfolk Fire Department, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and an oil spill response organization the EPA hired contained and cleaned up the spill. During the summer of 2009, Lake Explorer II was hauled out of the water at a shipyard in Portsmouth, Virginia, for upgrades to its structural components. A major part of this phase of its conversion was the installation of a new tank to hold all sewage generated aboard the ship, to ensure its compliance with strict zero- discharge standards for sewage on the Great Lakes. While it was out of the water at Portsmouth, the shipyard also replaced shaft tubes, replaced or rebuilt sea valves, painted its bottom with new anti-foul paint, and conducted a routine out-of-water inspection of its equipment and hull. In EPA service, the ship has a crew of four – a captain, first mate, chief engineer, and first engineer – and can embark up to seven scientists. =Operations= On 1 October 2009, with the conversion complete, Lake Explorer II and its crew departed the NOAA Marine Operations Base at Norfolk and, after a two-day transit in Atlantic Ocean waters, arrived in New York Harbor on 3 October 2009. Following a stay at New York City, the ship proceeded up the Hudson River to Albany, New York, where it entered the New York State Canal System. Over the course of four days, it navigated the Erie Canal and Oswego Canal, passing through 30 locks, before entering Lake Ontario at Oswego, New York. Lake Explorer II then crossed Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior, passing through nine more canal locks along the way, before arriving at its new home port, Duluth, Minnesota, on 16 October 2009, completing a 15-day journey of 1,580 miles. Operated throughout the Great Lakes by the EPA′s Mid-Continent Ecology Division, Lake Explorer II conducts research surveys designed to develop a comprehensive environmental assessment of coastal conditions in the Great Lakes and demonstrate a new generation of lakewide assessment designs which include nearshore ecosystems in lakewide assessment.epa.gov United States Environmental Protection Agency Mid-Continent Ecology Division \\"Research Vessel (R/V) Lake Explorer II Overview\\" Retrieved August 20, 2018 Its work includes the use of advanced technologies for sampling aquatic life, water quality, and sediments, including the deployment of advanced in situ environmental sensing system packages, which make continuous synoptic maps of water and plankton properties. allowing for greater efficiency during extensive research surveys.

This area of the Tidewater is not far from where they lived in 1600, prior to English colonization.Wood, Karenne (editor). Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, Charlottesville, VA: Virginia Foundation for the Humanities, 2007. They were officially recognized by the state in 1983 and the federal government in January 2018. The Eastern Chickahominy split from the main tribe in 1983 and were recognized separately by the state. They were also federally recognized in January 2018. They are based in New Kent County, about east of Richmond. Neither tribe has an Indian reservation, having lost their land to English colonists in the 18th century, but they have purchased lands that they devote to communal purposes. Both tribes are among the 11 who have organized and been officially recognized by Virginia since 1983. Federal status was granted to the Chickahominy and Eastern Chickahominy tribes through passage of the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017 on January 30, 2018. History The Chickahominy (\\"The Coarse Ground Corn People\\"Waugaman, Sandra F. and Danielle Moretti-Langholtz, Ph.D. We're Still Here: Contemporary Virginia Indians Tell Their Stories. Richmond: Palari Publishing, 2006 (revised edition).) were among numerous independent Algonquian-speaking tribes who had long occupied the Tidewater area. They were led by mungai (\\"great men\\"), who were part of a council of elders and religious leaders. The Chickahominy's original territory consisted of the land along the Chickahominy River (named by the English after them), from the mouth of the river at its confluence with the James River, near Jamestown in present-day Charles City County, to what is now known as New Kent County, Virginia. English depiction of the negotiation of the 1614 treaty They encountered settlers from the first permanent English settlement founded at Jamestown in 1607. The tribe helped the English survive during the first few winters by trading food for English goods, as the settlers were ill-prepared for farming and developing their frontier site. The Chickahominy taught the English how to grow and preserve crops in local conditions. By 1614, the tribe had signed a treaty with the colonists; it required the tribe to provide 300 warriors to fight the Spanish, which had an established colony in Florida and the lower East Coast.Egloff, Keith and Deborah Woodward. First People: The Early Indians of Virginia, Charlottesville: The University Press of Virginia, 1992. Over time, the English began to expand their settlements and crowded out the Chickahominy from their homeland. The peoples had earlier come into conflict over uses of land, as the Chickahominy expected to travel freely for hunting, and the English wanted to preserve some property as private. Following the Anglo-Powhatan Wars of 1644–46, the tribe was forced to cede most of its land to gain a peace treaty. The tribe resettled on reservation land set aside by the treaty in the Pamunkey Neck area, alongside another Virginia Algonquian tribe, the Pamunkey, between the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers. They stayed there until 1661, when they moved again to the headwaters of the Mattaponi, but their reserved holdings continued to suffer encroachment by the expanding English colony. In 1677, the Chickahominy were among the tribes signing a peace treaty with the King of England. Treaty of Middle Plantation (1677) The people lost title to the last part of their reservation lands in 1718, but continued to live in the area for some time. Those who did not merge with the Pamunkey and other tribes, slowly migrated back to New Kent County and Charles City County, closer to their original homeland. In the 20th century, descendants of these people organized to form the current Eastern Chickahominy and Chickahominy tribes, respectively. The migrations happened before the end of the 18th century, and few records survive in this \\"burnt- over district,\\" disrupted by major wars, by which to establish their dates of migration. While independent, the Chickahominy were at times allied in the 17th century with Chief Powhatan, and his paramount chiefdom, a confederacy of 30 or so Algonquian-speaking tribes. Records found within The National Archives (TNA) at Kew, West London, indicate the Chickahominy tribe may have served in a \\"police\\" role, used by Powhatan to quell rivalries and bring an end to infighting amongst other confederacy tribes. In return, they enjoyed some benefits, such as trading with the confederacy tribes. As part of the alliance between Powhatan's confederacy and the Chickahominy, it appears they were to act as a buffer \\"warrior force\\" between the confederacy tribes and other less friendly or hostile tribes in the event of an attack, thus giving Powhatan's forces time to mobilize.The White letters, The National Archives (TNA) at Kew, West London, – access=2014-06-07 Some 20th-century sources say the Chickahominy joined the Powhatan Confederacy in 1616.Rountree, Helen C. (editor). Powhatan Foreign Relations: 1500–1722. University of Virginia Press, 1993 Others contend they did not become tributaries of the paramount chiefdom until 1677, when Cockacoeske signed the Treaty of Middle Plantation. The treaty acknowledged her as leader of the Chickahominy and several other tribes. Chickahominy today In the early 21st century, the Chickahominy tribe consists of about 840 people who live within a five-mile (8-km) radius of each other and the tribal center, in an area known as Chickahominy Ridge. Several hundred more live in other parts of the United States, including California, Florida, New York, Oklahoma, and Pennsylvania. Current tribal lands of about are in the tribe's traditional territory, present-day Charles City County. The tribal center on the land is the location of an annual Powwow and Fall Festival. Wayne Adkins, a member of the Chickahominy Tribe, represents the tribe in the UK. The Chickahominy are led by a tribal council of 12 men and women, including a chief and two assistant chiefs. These positions are elected by members of the tribe, by vote. The current chief is Stephen Adkins. He served as Director of Human Resources for the Commonwealth of Virginia in the administration of Governor Tim Kaine. Wayne Adkins is an assistant chief, along with Reggie Stewart. Most members of the Chickahominy Tribe are Christian; many attend Samaria Baptist Church, formerly called Samaria Indian Church, in Charles City County. The church was built upon tribal grounds and once served as a school for the children of the tribe. The church is located directly across from the tribal headquarters. Eastern Chickahominy The people of the Chickahominy Tribe Eastern Division shared a history with the Chickahominy until the late 20th century, when they decided to organize their own tribal government. As their community was based in New Kent County, some found it inconvenient always to travel to Charles City County for tribal meetings. Others say the split happened because of disagreements over religious practice and land use. Family ties have kept the two tribes intertwined. Today, the Eastern Chickahominy have about 132 members and own about of land. Tribe members have served in the United States military since World War I. The tribe serves the needs of its community as a nontaxable organization. This is supported through contributions and from members who pay dues. Efforts at recognition The Chickahominy were recognized on January 11, 2018. U.S. Senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner secured passage of the Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act of 2017. Once signed by the President, the legislation granted federal recognition of the following six Virginia tribes: the Chickahominy, the Eastern Chickahominy, the Upper Mattaponi, the Rappahannock, the Monacan, and the Nansemond.Virginia Tribes , Virginia Council on Indians, Commonwealth of Virginia Since the 1990s, the tribes had been seeking federal recognition through an act of Congress. In March 2009, Representative Jim Moran of Virginia sponsored a bill to grant federal recognition to six Virginia Indian \\"landless\\" tribes: the Chickahominy, Eastern Chickahominy, Nansemond, Rappahannock Tribe, Upper Mattaponi, and the Monacan Nation. By June the bill had passed the House of Representatives. A day after it was voted on in the House, a companion bill was sent to the Senate. The Senate referred this bill to their Committee on Indian Affairs, which approved the bill on October 22, 2009. On December 23, 2009, the Senate added the bill to its legislative calendar. This is the farthest the bill has gotten in the congressional process.\\"H.R. 1385, Thomasina E. Jordan Indian Tribes of Virginia Federal Recognition Act\\", GovTrack.us This effort has been supported by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and executives of the Baptist Church, among other groups. The bill was opposed by Senator Tom Coburn (R-OK), who cited \\"jurisdictional concerns\\". The senator believes requests for tribal recognition should be processed through the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Moran and others support the congressional process in part because the Virginia tribes lost their continuity of records due to discriminatory actions of the state government that destroyed their records of Indian identity, under the changes resulting from the Racial Integrity Act of 1924 and the orders of Walter Plecker, the state registrar for the Bureau of Vital Statistics at the time. The Pamunkey and Mattaponi, also state-recognized, gained recognition in separate processes, through the BIA's administrative process. They believed their continuing residency on and control of their reservations demonstrated their historical continuity as tribes.Kimberlain, Joanne. \\"We're Still Here\\", The Virginian-Pilot, June 7–9, 2009 Working to improve its process, in 2013, the BIA announced proposed changes to regulations, which include allowing tribes to document a shorter timeframe to establish historical continuity. This has the potential of making it easier for tribes to establish recent historical continuity and gain recognition, as well as to speed up the bureau's review of documentation.

Emil Julius Gumbel described his body of work, collected in Studies in American Demography, as \\"the type of old-fashioned writings which will continue to be of value notwithstanding all progress achieved in mathematical statistics.\\" In 1911, Willcox claimed there would be \\"no children in the United States under five years of age\\" by the year 2020. Perpetuating ideas of race suicide, Willcox erroneously explained that the United States' birth rate meant that importing babies from France would be the only option for maintaining population levels.https://www.newspapers.com/image/58987567/ Publications * Studies in American Demography, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press (1940). * International Migrations, Volume II: Interpretations (Editor), New York: National Bureau of Economic Research (1931). * Walter Francis Willcox papers, #14-10-504.

Zingerone is a crystalline solid that is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ether. When synthesized and tasted does not have any pungency, suggesting it is more likely that zingerone is a decomposition product of, rather than the direct source of, the pungency of ginger.Steffen Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Materials of Natural Origin, pg. 280 Zingerone is similar in chemical structure to other flavor chemicals such as vanillin and eugenol. It is used as a flavor additive in spice oils and in perfumery to introduce spicy aromas. Fresh ginger does not contain zingerone, but it is produced by cooking or drying of the ginger root, which causes a reverse aldol reaction on gingerol.  Production  = History = Zingerone was first isolated from the ginger root in 1917 by Hiroshi Nomura, a chemistry professor at Tokyo Imperial University. Nomura named the compound and identified the empirical formula of zingerone in his studies at the laboratory of the Agricultural College. = Current methods = Nomura identified and later patented a method for the synthesis of zingerone, in which vanillin and acetone are reacted under basic conditions to form dehydrozingerone. This compound is obtained in about 95% quantity. This reaction is followed by catalytic hydrogenation of the intermediate compound in order to form zingerone, obtained in approximately 100% quantity.Nomura, Hiroshi. \\"Method of preparing 'zingerone' (methyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl-ethyl ketone.\\" U.S. Patent 1,263,796.

Life  = Early years and education= Lucie Gomperz was born in Vienna, Lower Austria, Austria-Hungary the youngest child of Benjamin Gomperz, a Jewish medical doctor who was a consultant to Sigmund Freud. She had two brothers, Paul Gomperz and Teddy Gomperz. Paul Gomperz was killed at the Italian front in 1917. She had a liberal upbringing. She studied pottery under Michael Powolny at the Vienna Kunstgewerbeschule, a school of arts and crafts associated with the Wiener Werkstätte, in which she enrolled in 1922. =Career= Vienna Lucie Rie's workshop, as exhibited in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London While in Vienna, Lucie's uncle from her mother's side had a collection of art that inspired her interest in archeology and architecture. She was first inspired by her uncle's Roman pottery collection which had been excavated from the suburbs of Vienna. She set up her first studio in Vienna in 1925 and exhibited the same year at the Paris International Exhibition. She was influenced by Neoclassicism, Jugendstil, modernism, and Japonism. In 1937, Rie won a silver medal at the Paris International Exhibition (the exhibition for which Pablo Picasso painted Guernica). Rie had her first solo show as a potter in 1949. London In 1938, Rie fled Nazi Austria and emigrated to England, where she settled in London. Around this time she separated from Hans Rie, a businessman whom she had married in Vienna in 1926, and their marriage was dissolved in 1940. For a time she provided accommodation to another Austrian émigré, the physicist Erwin Schrödinger. During and after the war, to make ends meet, she made ceramic buttons and jewellery for couture fashion outlets. Some of these are now displayed at London's Victoria and Albert Museum and as part of the Lisa Sainsbury Collection at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia, Norwich. In 1946, Rie hired Hans Coper, a young man with no experience in ceramics, to help her fire the buttons. Although Coper was interested in learning sculpture, she sent him to a potter named Heber Mathews, who taught him how to make pots on the wheel. Rie and Coper exhibited together in 1948. Coper became a partner in Rie's studio, where he remained until 1958. Their friendship lasted until Coper's death in 1981. Rie's small studio was at 18 Albion Mews, a narrow street of converted stables near Hyde Park in London. She invited many people to her studio and was renowned for giving her visitors tea and cake. The studio remained almost unchanged during the 50 years she occupied it and has been reconstructed in the Victoria and Albert Museum's ceramics gallery. Rie was a friend of Bernard Leach, one of the leading figures in British studio pottery in the mid-20th century, and she was impressed by his views, especially concerning the \\"completeness\\" of a pot. But despite his transient influence, her brightly coloured, delicate, modernist pottery stands apart from Leach's subdued, rustic, oriental work. She taught at Camberwell College of Arts from 1960 until 1972. She received several awards for her work and exhibited with great success. Her most famous creations are vases, bottles and bowls, which drew some inspiration from Japan as well as many other places. There are other works such as buttons, which she bequeathed to her close friend the Japanese designer Issey Miyake. =Death= Blue plaque at her former home on 18 Albion Mews, Paddington, London She stopped making pottery in 1990, when she suffered the first of a series of strokes. She died at home in London on 1 April 1995, aged 93. Legacy Rie's work has been described as cosmopolitan. She is best remembered for her bowl and bottle forms. Her pottery is displayed in collections around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the York Art Gallery in the UK, the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, and Paisley Museum in Scotland. She influenced many during her 60 year career and developed very inventive kiln processing. Her studio was moved and reconstructed in the new ceramics gallery at the Victoria and Albert Museum opened in 2009. She was awarded the title of Dame Commander (DCE) after teaching at the Camberwell School of Art from 1960 until 1971.

It was founded in 1909 by the Sisters of the Assumption, Rygaards is a co-educational day school amalgamated within the Danish School System. It is a private, state-subsidized school directed by a school board. The school is made up of two schools. One is a Danish Private School serving a community permanently resident in Denmark. The other is an International School, whose curriculum is based on the British system/National Curriculum adapted to international needs, and serves those who are in Denmark on a temporary basis. The school is a member of The Council of British International Schools (COBIS), the European Council of International Schools(ECIS), the Association of Catholic Schools in Denmark (FAKS) and the Danish International Schools Network (DISN). History The Sisters of the Assumption started the school in 1909 and the connection with the Order is still strong. In August 2009 they celebrated their 100-year Jubilee. Many activities were organised for this special occasion. There were thousands of people present over the course of the day with so many having travelled from all over the world for the occasion. Therefore, the school started almost 100 years ago when on 13 October 1908, a group of six Sisters (four French, one German and one Belgian) were invited to Denmark by the Bishop of Copenhagen in order to open a private school for girls. The Sisters belonged to the French congregation known as 'Les Religieuses de l'Assomption' – The Assumption Sisters, an order of nuns that already were well established and were running 17 similar schools worldwide, in France, Spain, Nicaragua, The Philippines, Belgium and El Salvador. On 13 September 1909, the Sisters opened their school in Copenhagen with just eight pupils – all girls. It was called “L’Institut de L’Assomption', was entirely French speaking and welcomed girls of all religions. Initially, eleven Sisters came to Denmark to establish and run the new school. They brought with them the mission of their Foundress Mother Marie-Eugénie Milleret: to change the world through the education of children. Mother Marie-Eugénie believed that the world could only be changed by developing the characters of children, especially girls. A good education would provide them with morality and integrity necessary to influence decisions in the wider world and create opportunities for justice in society. The prospect of such an education was not available in Denmark for girls at that time. As the number of pupils began to grow, the school needed a larger building and so moved to St Andrea’s, a Jesuit college, in Ordrup. It was still called “L’Institut de L’Assomption” but was more commonly known as The French School. As the years passed and the school grew more it again became necessary to find new and more suitable accommodation. Therefore, in 1930, the sisters bought a farm in the rural area of Gentofte, outside Copenhagen. The farm was surrounded by stables and fields and was an ideal home for the expanding school and its pupils. The farm was called “Rygaard”. The school continued to be called “L’Institut de l’Assomption” and was now run by a group of Sisters who lived on the premises. It was still managed as a private institution and continued to offer education in French to daughters of Danish and International families. Although the teaching was clearly Christian, the school did not set out to convert or indoctrinate pupils, rather instil in them the values and characteristics found in the Gospel. The aim of the Sisters was to develop the character of each pupil to reach their own potential. In 1935 the Sisters had a church built on the land next to the school. The Mother Superior at the time, Mere Madeleine Eugenie had a special devotion to Saint Therese, from whom the name of the church derives. During the Second World War when Denmark was occupied the Sisters with the help of some local people risked their lives hiding Jewish children from the Nazis under the church. The children were eventually smuggled down to Hellerup harbour and taken by boat across to neutral Sweden. The local Parish Church of St. Theresa is an integral part of the school buildings and is used by the school for both Catholic and Ecumenical services. In 1949 the school was given the official right to hold examinations. Before this, the children had to go the university to take their examinations. In 1958 the Danish government began awarding a financial subsidy to the school and an education in Danish was also offered. For the first time in the school's history, boys were now admitted. In the years that followed, the demand for an education in English grew and the Sisters began teaching in English as well as French. It was in 1965 that the British National Curriculum was adopted in the International Department and two years later, in 1967, the Sisters accepted a government subsidy and merged the Danish and International Departments to form what we now know as Rygaards Skole. The present school continues to follow the goals of those early beginnings, namely to offer an excellent quality of education in a Christian spirit. The aim of the International Department is to provide a sound education, in English, in order to enable students to return to their own national system, or continue at another international school. For both departments particular emphasis is placed upon mutual understanding and respect among the many nationalities in the school. The education given is, above all, in the Christian spirit; great importance is placed upon the religious and moral development of the individual student. Religious Awareness programmes are offered to all students. Roman Catholics are given separate instruction RIS has its own staff of permanently resident, fully qualified, experienced teachers who are native speakers of English. Foreign language teachers - French and German - are native speakers of the languages they teach. Rygaards is one of the best international schools in Copenhagen. Structure The school is actually two schools under one roof, a Danish and an International school. As of August 2015 the school has been in the process of renovation, and will in May 2016 be opening a new Learning Resource Center. =The Danish School= Has approx. 500 students from 6–16 years of age and serves a community that is permanently resident in Denmark. It prepares the students, in Danish, for further education in Danish institutions. At the end of the final year the students take the Danish national examinations (FSA). Most students then go on to Danish gymnasium to continue their secondary education. =The International School= Has approx. 500 students from 4–16 years of age and caters - irrespective of creed and nationality - for those who are only in Denmark on a temporary basis. At the end of the final year the students take IGCSE examinations that are set at Cambridge International Examinations in the UK. Students then go on to other schools, in Denmark and around the world, to continue their secondary education. Motto The school's motto is \\"Semper Ardens\\", this is Latin for always burning. Location The school is in Hellerup, a suburb about north of the centre of Copenhagen. The main building is an old manor house situated in park-like grounds dating from the 18th century. Management Rygaards School is run by a Board of Governors and a leadership team. The board consists of five members. Two of the members are elected by the parents of the school. One parent is elected from the Danish School and represents the Danish parents and the other is elected among the parents of the International School and represents these parents. The third member of the Board is appointed by the Sisters of the Assumption, the fourth is appointed by the local parish church, Skt Theressa and the fifth member is appointed by the Bishop of Denmark. The day-to-day running of the school is carried out by a leadership team made up of a principal and four heads of school.

Some of his skeletal confirmations include John F. Kennedy, victims of John Wayne Gacy, King Tutankhamun, victims of the Oklahoma City bombing, and Dr. Josef Mengele.  Biography  Snow started his higher education at the New Mexico Military Institute where he earned an Associated Degree. He then flunked out of Southern Methodist University. After that, he attended Eastern New Mexico University to earn his Bachelor's Degree. His master's degree in Zoology was then earned at Texas Technical University. Finally, he attended University of Arizona and achieved his Ph.D. in Anthropology. In 1968, Snow became the head of the department of Forensic Anthropology at Civil Aeromedical Institute. On September 25, 1978, Dr. Snow testified before the House Select Committee on Assassinations about various forensic aspects of the Kennedy assassination. He denied that E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis were among the Three tramps found in a railroad car behind the Grassy Knoll. However, he also testified \\"[Hunt] has rather protruding ears and in later photographs, they have been brought back closer to his head\\" with plastic surgery. By 1972, the American Academy of Forensic Sciences recognized forensic work as a specialty of anthropology. Since 1979, Snow turned his focus to forensics exclusively. He worked with various human rights groups and brought to attention mass graves of civilians in Argentina, and spent five years training many of the founding members of the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (Equipo Argentino de Antropología Forense, EAAF). So far at least five officers in Argentina were convicted partially due to Snow's work in the mass graves. The success of this mission led to the creation of Guatemalan Forensic Anthropology Team as well when survivors of the Guatemalan Civil War sought his help in 1991. In 1991, Snow traveled to San Vicente, Bolivia, to search for the remains of the American outlaws Butch Cassidy (Robert Leroy Parker) and the Sundance Kid (Harry Alonzo Longabaugh). However, the exact location of the grave was only known with an accuracy of several yards, and the grave excavated was found to contain the remains of a German miner named Gustav Zimmer. No remains were found whose DNA matched that of Parker and Longabaugh's families. In 1997, Snow worked on mass graves found in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Snow also participated in a re- enactment of an excavation of Butch Masters in Illinois that aired on The Discovery Channel episode Science Detectives on Discover Magazine.Forensics Enterprises, Inc.: The re-enactment of an Excavation for the Discovery Channel: \\"The Master's Case\\" In 2004, Snow appeared on the Unsolved History documentary television series episode Hunting Nazis on The Discovery Channel.Discovery Channel Store: Unsolved History: Hunting Nazis As of 2005, Snow lived with his wife near Oklahoma City. He continued teaching at the University of Oklahoma, and he also did occasional lectures for Forensic Science organizations and law enforcement personnel.

It was known as Warwickshire Constabulary until 2001. It is the second smallest territorial police force in England and Wales after the City of London Police, with only 823 (full-time equivalents) regular officers as of September 2017. The resident population of the force area is 554,002 . History The force was established in 1840 as Warwickshire Constabulary. It did not, however, even cover all the rural areas of the county until 1857. Birmingham, Coventry, Leamington Spa, Stratford-upon-Avon and Warwick originally had their own police forces. The Warwickshire force absorbed Warwick Borough Police in 1875 and Stratford-upon-Avon Borough Police in 1889 with Leamington Borough Police lasting until 1946. In 1969, Coventry City Police amalgamated with Warwickshire Constabulary and the force became Warwickshire and Coventry Constabulary. However, with the inclusion of Coventry in the new county of the West Midlands in 1974, Coventry passed to the new West Midlands Police, which also took over the areas of the Birmingham City Police and part of the northwestern area of Warwickshire (around Solihull and Sutton Coldfield). Warwickshire Constabulary reverted to its old name. Under proposals announced by the then Home Secretary, Charles Clarke, on 6 February 2006, Warwickshire Police would have merged with Staffordshire Police, West Mercia Constabulary and West Midlands Police to form a single strategic force for the West Midlands region. These proposals were subsequently abandoned. Warwickshire Police was until April 2007 a partner alongside three other forces in the Central Motorway Police Group. In August 2010, the second Warwickshire Justice Centre was opened in Newbold Terrace, Leamington Spa. As well as a police station, the complex houses the Magistrates' Court, Crown Court, County Court, and other agencies such as the Probation Service and Victim Support. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 4 March 2011. A similar complex was already in operation in Nuneaton. Organisation The force is run by a Chief Constable, a Deputy Chief Constable, an Assistant Chief Constable, and shared Director of Enabling Services. Director of Finance and Transformation Director with West Mercia Police. The county is divided into Districts and Boroughs (based on local government districts/boroughs). There are 33 local policing teams within Warwickshire Police – called Safer Neighbourhood Teams – which are broken down within each District/Borough as follows: *North Warwickshire Borough North Warwickshire North North Warwickshire East North Warwickshire South North Warwickshire West *Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Nuneaton North Nuneaton West Nuneaton South Nuneaton East Nuneaton Central  Nuneaton Town Centre Bedworth West Bedworth East *Rugby Borough Rugby Town East Rugby Town West Rugby Town Centre Rugby Town North Rugby Rural Central Rugby Rural North Rugby Rural South *Stratford-on-Avon District Alcester North Alcester South Shipston Southam Stratford Town Wellesbourne *Warwick District Kenilworth Warwick Central Leamington North Leamington South Leamington Town Centre Warwick Rural East Warwick Rural West Whitnash *Police Stations (location details and opening hours via link) Nuneaton Justice Centre https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/article/4238/Nuneaton-Justice-Centre Royal Leamington Spa Justice Centre https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/article/4239/Leamington-Spa-Justice-Centre Rugby Police Station https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/article/4235/Rugby- Police-Station Stratford upon Avon Police Station https://www.warwickshire.police.uk/article/4236/Stratford-Police-Station *Other facilities Leek Wootton Current Force Communications Centre *Justice centres Nuneaton Open seven days a week.

North Warwickshire, Nuneaton and Bedworth and Rugby make up the North Warwickshire Policing Area and Stratford-on-Avon and Warwick make up the South Warwickshire Policing Area. The current Chief Constable is Martin Jelley, who was appointed to the role on 7 April 2015 following the retirement of Andy Parker. Andy Parker succeeded Keith Bristow on 1 December 2011. Keith Bristow succeeded John Burbeck, who in turn succeeded Andrew Timpson, who in turn succeeded Peter Joslin. West Mercia alliance On 30 September 2013, Warwickshire Police embarked on an alliance with West Mercia Police which saw one of the biggest reorganisations the force ever had. The force is now committed to the alliance which sees the sharing of back office facilities, force systems and support teams whilst retaining its own identity. It is hoped that the alliance will save £20 million. The alliance has now fully taken place merging all departments, officers and staff below the grade of Deputy Chief constable and Police and Crime Commissioner. On 8 October 2018, West Mercia Police Chief Constable and PCC started formal proceedings to end the alliance. This action was not supported by Warwickshire Police Chief Constable or PCC. The alliance will formally cease to exist on 9 October 2019.

His writings included novels, stories, poetry, journalism, and works not easily classified. He was a mentor to Jorge Luis Borges and other avant-garde Argentine writers. Seventeen years of his correspondence with Borges was published in 2000. His published poetry includes \\"Creía yo\\" (\\"I believed\\").  Life  Macedonio (like Uruguay's Felisberto Hernández, he is commonly referred to by his first name only) was the son of Macedonio Fernández, farmer and military officer, and Rosa del Mazo Aguilar Ramos. In 1887, he enrolled in the Argentine Colegio Nacional Central. In 1891-1892, as a university student, he published in El Progreso, a series of critical essays on customs and manners later included in Papeles antiguos. Like his intimate friend Jorge Guillermo Borges (father of Jorge Luis Borges), he was interested in psychology and in the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer. In 1897 he was granted a degree as a doctor of jurisprudence by the law faculty of the University of Buenos Aires. In this period, he wrote for La Montaña, a socialist daily directed by Leopoldo Lugones and José Ingenieros. He was a personal friend of physician, journalist, politician, and writer Juan B. Justo, with whom he maintained a correspondence. In 1898, he was admitted to the bar, and in 1899 he married Elena de Obieta, with whom he had four children (Macedonio, Adolfo, Maite, plus one) In 1904 he published some poems in a magazine called Martín Fierro (not the more famous magazine of the same name published two decades later). In 1910, he obtained the position of public prosecutor in the Juzgado Letrado de Posadas, which he held for several years. His wife died in 1920, and their children were left in the care of grandparents and aunts. Macedonio abandoned the profession of a lawyer. On the return of the Borges family from Europe in 1921, he renewed his friendship with his old friend, and also began a friendship with Jorge Luis Borges, at this time a young ultraist poet. In 1928 he published No toda es vigilia la de los ojos abiertos, at the request of Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz and Leopoldo Marechal; the next year he published Papeles de Recienvenido. En 1938 he published \\"Novela de Eterna\\" y la Niña del dolor, la \\"Dulce-persona\\" de un amor que no fue sabido, an anticipation of Museo de la Novela de la Eterna (published posthumously in 1967); in 1941 he published, in Chile Una novela que comienza, and in 1944 a new edition of Papeles de Recienvenido. In 1947, Macedonio moved into the home of his son Adolfo de Obieta, where he lived for the rest of his life. Macedonio and Borges Macedonio was Jorge Luis Borges's most important Argentine mentor and influence. The relationship between the writers, however, was far more complex than Borges or his contemporaries represented it to be. In his later years, Borges made a point of naming Macedonio as an early influence whom, in the exuberance of his youth, Borges imitated \\"to the point of plagiarism.\\" At the same time, Borges denied that Macedonio possessed any literary talent or importance, reinforcing the long-held perception of the older man as a kind of local Socratic philosopher, specific to Argentina and constitutive of an Argentine mythic dimension. Recent studies by Ana Camblong, Julio Prieto, Daniel Attala and Todd S. Garth, among others, indicate that Macedonio's literary impact on Borges was far more profound and enduring than Borges ever admitted, and that Borges went to great pains to hide this influence. Many of the most fundamental concepts underpinning Borges' fiction come directly from Macedonio. These include the questioning of space and time and their continuity; the confusion of dreaming and wakefulness; the unreliability of memory and the importance of forgetfulness; the slipperiness (or nonexistence) of personal identity; the denial of originality and the emphasis on texts as being recyclings and translations of prior texts; and the questioning and commingling of the roles of author, reader, editor and commentator. These influences extend to thematic material. Such themes include the conceit of an alternative, fictional dimension, elaborated anonymously in collaboration, that invades the known, tangible world (Borges' \\"Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius\\" and Macedonio's campaign to transform Buenos Aires by turning it into a novel, a component of his Museo de la Novela de la Eterna); and the hermetic world of immigrant working girls who must negotiate the city on their own, secret terms based purely on instinct and passion (Borges' \\"Emma Zunz\\" and Macedonio's Adriana Buenos Aires). While it is evident both men were inspired by ideas they read in the works of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century philosophers (specifically Schopenhauer and Bergson), there is little question that the two Argentines developed some of their most characteristic and enduring ideas together, in conversation, throughout the 1920s. Macedonio appears explicitly in Borges' \\"Dialogue about a Dialogue,\\"Borges , Jorges Luis. Trans. Mildred Boyer and Harold Morland. Dreamtigers. University of Texas Press, 1985, p. 25. in which the two discuss the immortality of the soul. The relationship between these two men began in earnest in 1921, when Borges returned to Buenos Aires with his family after their extended stay in Switzerland (and travels elsewhere in Europe), where he had completed his education. Borges' father, Jorge Guillermo Borges Haslam, had been a close companion to Macedonio and attended law school with him. Upon graduating law school, Macedonio, the elder Borges, and companion Julio Molina y Vedia hatched a plan to found a utopian colony based on the anarchist principles of Élisée Reclus. This plan apparently never went beyond an exploratory visit the three made around 1897 to a plantation the Molina y Vedia family owned in the Argentine Chaco, near the Bolivian border. During the years prior to 1921, Macedonio married, started a law practice and went about raising a family. This idyll came to an end when Macedonio's wife, Elena de Obieta, died suddenly in 1920. Macedonio then shuttered his law practice, dismantled his household and, about the same time as he renewed his friendship with the now adult Jorge Luis Borges, embarked on a life as an idiosyncratic writer- philosopher. Borges and other members of the generación martinfierrista were drawn to Macedonio as a mentor and figurehead who could serve as an anchor to the nascent Buenos Aires avant-garde and a foil to Leopoldo Lugones, leader of the modernista movement of a generation earlier. Macedonio made noteworthy, if infrequent, contributions to the literary gatherings of the ultraísta movement and the related \\"Florida\\" group of writers and artists. Borges was an active participant in Macedonio's intimate tertulias, both in Buenos Aires bars and cafés and in a shack Macedonio sometimes borrowed on a friend's ranch outside the city. He also was one of the collaborators in Macedonio's burlesque campaigns for the presidency of the Argentine Republic (in 1921 and again in 1927), episodes which apparently gave rise to the analogous fictional campaign in Museo. In addition, Borges was responsible for urging Macedonio to publish at least one of the two book-length works printed in Macedonio's lifetime, No toda es vigilia la de los ojos abiertos, in 1926. The relationship between Borges and Macedonio appears to have begun to deteriorate around 1927 or 1928, when correspondence (published and analyzed by Carlos García) indicates a rift between them. This is also about the time that Borges made his famous break with the avant-garde and pronounced the death of Argentine ultraísmo, essentially forcing the closure of its most important publication, the little magazine Martín Fierro, after its sixteenth issue. The two events may not be coincidental. From 1927 onward, Borges not only started to write, publish and promote his characteristic short fiction (beginning with \\"Hombre de la esquina rosada\\"), he aggressively renounced his prior aesthetic production and put considerable energy into burying it forever. A number of sources (Donald Shaw in particular) suggest that Borges began to regard most of his early writings, and the ideas behind them, as potentially pernicious, especially in the hands of nationalists. Supporting this notion is the fact that many of Borges's stories in which Macedonio's influence is most evident imply a warning against concepts and principles Macedonio represented: absolute relativism; the priority of thought, emotion and imagination over a nominal existence; and the implicit heroism of a hermetic existence.

Dermatoscopy is the examination of skin lesions with a dermatoscope. Also known as dermoscopy or epiluminescence microscopy, it allows for inspection of skin lesions unobstructed by skin surface reflections. The dermatoscope consists of a magnifier, a light source (polarized or non-polarised), a transparent plate and sometimes a liquid medium between the instrument and the skin. When the images or video clips are digitally captured or processed, the instrument can be referred to as a digital epiluminescence dermatoscope. This technique is useful to dermatologists in distinguishing benign from malignant (cancerous) lesions, especially in the diagnosis of melanoma. Types of dermatoscopy A dermatoscope is composed of a transilluminating light source and a magnifying optic (usually a 10-fold magnification). There are three main modes of dermoscopy: * Nonpolarized light, contact * Polarized light, contact * Polarized light, noncontact Polarized light allows for visualization of deeper skin structures, while non-polarized light provide information about the superficial skin. Most modern dermatoscopes allow the user to toggle between the two modes, which provide complementary information. Advantages of dermatoscopy With doctors who are experts in dermatoscopy, the diagnostic accuracy for melanoma is significantly better than those who do not have any specialized training. Thus, there is considerable improvement in the sensitivity (detection of melanomas) as well as specificity (percentage of non-melanomas correctly diagnosed as benign), compared with naked eye examination. The accuracy by dermatoscopy was increased up to 20% in the case of sensitivity and up to 10% in the case of specificity, compared with naked eye examination.http://www.bcbstx.com/provider/pdf/medicalpolicies/medicine/201-023.pdf By using dermatoscopy the specificity is thereby increased, reducing the frequency of unnecessary surgical excisions of benign lesions. Application of dermatoscopy # The typical application of dermatoscopy is early detection of melanoma (see above) # Digital dermatoscopy (videodermatoscopy) is used for monitoring skin lesions suspicious of melanoma. Digital dermatoscopy images are stored and compared to images obtained during the patient’s next visit. Suspicious changes in such a lesion are an indication for excision. Skin lesions, which appear unchanged over time are considered benign. Common systems for digital dermoscopy are Fotofinder, Molemax, DermoGenius, Easyscan or HEINE. # Aid in the diagnosis of skin tumors - such as basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, cylindromas, dermatofibromas, angiomas, seborrheic keratosis and many other common skin tumors have classical dermatoscopic findings. # Aid in the diagnosis of scabies and pubic louse. By staining the skin with India ink, a dermatoscope can help identify the location of the mite in the burrow, facilitating scraping of the scabetic burrow. By magnifying pubic louse, it allows for rapid diagnosis of the difficult to see small insects. # Aid in the diagnosis of warts. By allowing a physician to visualize the structure of a wart, to distinguish it from corn, callouses, trauma, or foreign bodies. By examining warts at late stages of treatment, to assure that therapy is not stopped prematurely due to difficult to visualize wart structures. # Aid in the diagnosis of fungal infections. To differentiate \\"black dot\\" tinea, or tinea capitis (fungal scalp infection) from alopecia areata. # Aid in the diagnosis of hair and scalp diseases, such as alopecia areata, female androgenic alopecia, monilethrix, Netherton syndrome, and woolly hair syndrome. Dermoscopy of hair and scalp is called trichoscopy. # Determination of surgical margin of hard to define skin cancers. Examples would be Bowen’s disease, superficial basal cell carcinomas, and lentigo malignas. These tumors have very indistinct margins. By allowing the surgeon to correctly identify the true extent of the tumor, repeat surgery often is decreased. # Differentiation of tinea nigra from malignant melanoma or junctional melanocytic nevus. History Skin surface microscopy started in 1663 by Kolhaus and was improved with the addition of immersion oil in 1878 by Ernst Abbe. The German dermatologist, Johann Saphier, added a built-in light source to the instrument. Goldman was the first dermatologist to coin the term \\"dermascopy\\" and to use the dermatoscope to evaluate pigmented cutaneous lesions. In 1989 dermatologists from the Ludwigs-Maximilian- University of Munich developed a new device for dermoscopy. A team of physicians led by Professor Otto Braun-Falco in collaboration with the medical device manufacturer HEINE Optotechnik developed a dermatoscope, which was hand-held and illuminated by an halogen lamp. It also featured an achromatic lens with a 10-fold magnification. To reduce light reflection the lesion was covered with immersion oil. This dermatoscope helped to diagnose pigmented skin lesions more quickly and easily. The approach was confirmed by Wilhelm Stolz et al. from the Department of Dermatology and Allergology of the University of Munich and published in the \\"Lancet\\"(1989). At the Medical University of Vienna a dermatoscope based on cross-polarization was invented and patented, a methodology further used in digital dermatoscopes such as the MoleMax™-device or by FotoFinder. Following, in 2001, a California medical device manufacturer, 3Gen, introduced the first polarized handheld dermatoscope, the DermLite. Polarized illumination, coupled with a cross- polarised viewer, reduces (polarised) skin surface reflection, thus allowing visualisation of skin structures (the light from which is depolarised) without using an immersion fluid. Examination of several lesions is thus more convenient because physicians no longer have to stop and apply immersion oil, alcohol, or water to the skin before examining each lesion. With the marketing of polarised dermatoscopes, dermatoscopy increased in popularity among physicians worldwide. Although images produced by polarised light dermatoscopes are slightly different from those produced by a traditional skin contact glass dermatoscope, they have certain advantages, such as vascular patterns not being potentially missed through compression of the skin by a glass contact plate. Due to the fairly standardised imaging, and limited amount of diagnoses compared to clinical dermatology, dermatoscopic images became one center of interest for automated medical image analysis. While in the past decades computer vision algorithms and hardware-based method were used , large standardized public image collections such as HAM10000 enabled application of convolutional neural networks. The latter approach has now shown experimental evidence of human-level accuracy in larger/international , and smaller/local trials , but this application is not without dispute .

Treasure Cove! is a side-scrolling educational adventure game whose objective is to restore the destroyed rainbow bridge by collecting gems throughout the cove. To find the gems, the player must correctly answer simple math and reading questions asked by starfish to get clues about where they are hidden. It earned generally positive reviews as well as an award at the 1993 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. Gameplay Treasure Cove! is a side- scrolling educational / adventure game whose objective is to plug pipes that are leaking oil into the ocean. The game takes place in the fictional Treasure Cove which is being polluted with byproducts from experiments done by the Master of Mischief, a common antagonist of The Learning Company's Super Seekers games. The player takes on the role of the Super Seeker, whose job is to plug the pipes leaking oil and rebuild the destroyed bridge to the island by finding gems in the cove in order to stop the pollution at its source. The cove has three separate areas that the player must visit and collect gems to plug the pipes that leak \\"goobies\\" by finding the puffer fish and dropping it on the opening. If a player hits a goobie, one light unit is taken from them. To find the puffer fish, the player must gather clues by catching orange starfish and answering their riddles. There are three clues per stage, each a single descriptive term such as \\"three\\", \\"swimming\\", or \\"eels\\". The player must then shine his flashlight on the group of animals that are described by clues to obtain the puffer fish. Shining light on a group of animals that matches two of the three clues will reveal a gem, adding points towards restoring the Rainbow Bridge. After finding gems and plugging leaks in each of the three areas, the player will surface and add the gems collected during the most recent game to the total gem count. When the player has collected a certain number of gems, the player goes up in star rank and the Rainbow Bridge is extended farther. Higher star ranks means that there are more gems to find, the riddles are more difficult, and the fish that steal light move faster and are harder to avoid. Development Treasure Cove! is one of the four games of The Learning Company's \\"Treasure\\" series along with Treasure Mountain!, Treasure Mathstorm!, and Treasure Galaxy!. The Treasure series is a subgroup of the company's Super Solvers series.

Initially produced by Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH, the firm was acquired in 1996 by Fairchild Aircraft. The resulting firm, named Fairchild-Dornier, manufactured the 328 family in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, conducted sales from San Antonio, Texas, United States, and supported the product line from both locations. A jet- powered version of the aircraft, the Fairchild Dornier 328JET, was also produced. Development =Origins= The Dornier 328 (or Do 328) program was initially started while Dornier was still owned by Deutsche Aerospace. According to Deutsche Aerospace program manager Reinhold Birrenbach, the 328 had its origins in market research conducted in and around 1984; feedback from airlines indicated a desire for a fast, quiet, and easy-to-maintain commuter airliner with a 30-seat capacity.Moxon 1991, p. 69. This market research reportedly led Deutsche Aerospace to formulate a sales prediction of 400 or greater units being purchased overall; this forecast was in part derived from the reasoning that the 328 would be more advanced than its nearest competitors.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, pp. 31–32. Favourable features included a high cruising speed of 345 kt (640 km/h), as well as a higher cruising altitude and range, making the aircraft almost as fast as jet airliners while being more fuel-efficient; a trend away from spoke–and-hub distribution in favour of point-to-point transit was also viewed as being favourable to the 328.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, pp. 32–33. In December 1988, the 328 project was relaunched following the granting of shareholder approval after negotiations between the Dornier family and Daimler Benz. As the result of a six-month evaluation, a selection of powerplants deemed to be appropriate for the 328 was formed, these being the General Electric CT7-9D, the Garrett TPE-341-21, and the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW119A. While the Garrett engine was viewed by Deutsche Aerospace as being technically superior, Pratt & Whitney's powerplant was more advanced in development, thus was chosen.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 34. The engine selection was soon followed by the selection of a six-bladed composite propeller from Hartzell, Hartzell's submission being reportedly substantially lighter than competing bids from Dowty and Hamilton Standard. Following various considerations between electromechanical and digital instrumentation, Dornier opted for a digital glass cockpit and selected Honeywell to provide this after considering options from Saab Group, Rockwell Collins, and Smiths Aerospace.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 38. In May 1991, Horizon Air, a US-based airline, placed an order for 35 aircraft; this was the largest order for the 328 at that point and was larger than any other order for it or its competitors to be placed that year.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 32. In October 1991, the first prototype of the 328 was formally rolled out.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 31. On 6 December 1991, the first prototype conducted the type's maiden flight.Swanborough 1992, p. 123. On 4 June 1992, a second 328 prototype performed its first flight.\\"Second Dornier 328 Joins Test Programme.\\" Flight International, 23 June 1992. p. 9. On 14 December 1992, one of the 328 prototypes suffered a near-catastrophic in-flight propeller failure when all six propeller blades on one engine detached before puncturing the fuselage; the subsequent temporary loss of control caused the aircraft to roll 280° and descend 5,000 ft before control was recovered.Barrie, Douglas. \\"Dornier 328 prototype hit by propeller failure.\\" Flight International, 12 January 1993. p. 4. On 13 October 1993, the 328 formally entered commercial service.Taylor 1999, p. 195.\\"Premiere: Dornier 328.\\" Flight International, 8 October 1991. p. 28. The 328 was launched into the market during a period of large numbers of competing turboprop aircraft, as well as increasing competition from newly launched regional jets, which were becoming increasingly popular during the early 1990s.\\"Fairchild Dornier Gmbh Company Profile, Information, Business Description, History, Background Information on Fairchild Dornier Gmbh.\\" Reference for Business, Retrieved: 5 May 2008.\\"DASA warns of clash in regional launch plans.\\" Flight International, 10 December 1991. p. 6. The 328 had the advantages of being both quieter and faster than many of its rivals, but this did not ensure its commercial success. The latter half of the 328 program took place during a recession, which curtailed demand for new aircraft from operators. Both the 328 and the wider Dornier division of Deutsche Aerospace proved to be losing money; accordingly, Deutsche Aerospace wavered in committing more resources to the regional aircraft market, repeatedly delaying a decision to proceed with a 48-seat stretched model of the 328, which had originally been unveiled in 1991.Barrie, Douglas. \\"Domier details a stretched Do.328.\\" Flight International, 29 October 1991. pp. 4–5.\\"DASA dithers on Dornier 328 stretch.\\" Flight International, 11 May 1993. p. 10.\\"Buyers demand stretched Dornier 328.\\" Flight International, 11 June 1991. p. 5. =Further development= During the early 1990s, Deutsche Aerospace and Fokker explored the prospects of a commercial relationship to mutually engage the regional aircraft market;\\"Decisions, Decisions.\\" Flight International, 2 June 1992. pp. 35, 38. this cumulated in Deutsche Aerospace purchasing a 40% stake in Fokker in 1993. In June 1995, Deutsche Aerospace and Daewoo Heavy Industries were reportedly conducting talks on the establishment of a second 328 assembly line in South Korea for the Asian market.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"DASA in talks over Korean 328 deal production.\\" Flight International, 14 June 1995. In 1995, both Fokker and Deutsche Aerospace suffered substantial financial difficulties, which ultimately led to the end of the latter's ambitions to dominate the European regional aircraft market.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"DASA dealt double blow.\\" Flight International, 23 August 1995.Jeziorski, Andrzej. \\"DASA folds its wings.\\" Flight International, 31 January 1996. In June 1996, Deutsche Aerospace sold the majority of Dornier Luftfahrt GmbH to American manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft, leading to the creation of Fairchild Dornier GmbH. The newly combined Fairchild Dornier company emerged as the third-largest regional aircraft manufacturer in the world, and viewed the 328 as being both a key product in its lineup and the basis for a future family of aircraft. Continuing development of a jet-powered variant of the 328 was initially designated as the Dornier 328-300 and later simply known as the Dornier 328JET, which had been started under Deutsche Aerospace. Fairchild Dornier also sought to develop a stretched version, designated as the Dornier 428JET, and a dedicated freighter model.\\"Dornier sets jet date.\\" Flight International, 17 September 1996. p. 9.Doyle, Andrew. \\"Regional Aviation: Joining the Jet Age.\\" Flight International, 28 September 1999. Additionally, Farchild Dornier developed a larger aircraft, the Fairchild Dornier 728 family. In addition to typical passenger models, business jet configurations of both the 728JET and 928JET were projected, tentatively referred to as Envoy 3 and Envoy 7, respectively. The ambitious family project drew the support of the German government, which guaranteed US$350 million in loans for the scheme. During the late 1990s, Fairchild Dornier struggled to find both capital and strategic partners to support the project, and the company ultimately entered bankruptcy in April 2002. =Dornier aftermath= A Dornier 328, 2006 Following the bankruptcy of Fairchild Dornier, AvCraft Aviation acquired the Dornier 328/328JET rights, but this company entered bankruptcy itself less than three years later. In June 2006, 328 Support Services GmbH acquired the type certificate for the Dornier 328. It provides maintenance, repair, and overhaul services to the existing in-service fleet. In February 2015, US engineering company Sierra Nevada Corporation acquired 328 Support Services GmbH. Shortly thereafter, Sierra Nevada's owner, Turkish-American engineer Fatih Ozmen established a private corporation named Özjet Havacılık Teknolojileri A.Ş. at Technopark of Bilkent University, Ankara, and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Transportation Ministry of Turkey to manufacture the 328 at Ankara. In June 2015, the Turkish government launched the Turkish TR328 and TRJ328 regional aircraft project, a modernized 328/328JET, with either turboprops or jets for civil and military use and a larger TR628/TRJ-628 forecasting a break-even level and market of 500–1000 for each type. While first flight was anticipated in 2019, Turkey abandoned the program in October 2017, after facing increasing costs and being no longer confident of market demand forecasts. Believing in the under 40-seat market, Sierra Nevada Corporation and 328 Support Services GmbH are searching for other means to revive the aircraft, hoping to follow through by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Existing aircraft can be sourced by 328 Support Services and converted for civil transport, military operations, medical evacuation, or freighter or utility missions for $7–9 million, including zero time turboprops. Sierra Nevada Corp. plans to build a new stretched 328 in Germany. =Future development= A 21 August 2019 press-conference should precise the manufacturer establishment in Leipzig, Saxony. On this day, 328 Support Services announced the formation of DRA GmbH to establish its final assembly line for the D328NEU at Leipzig/Halle Airport, creating of up to 250 new jobs there and over 100 jobs in Oberpfaffenhofen, near Munich; the programme should be detailed late in the first quarter of 2020. The company signed a MoU with the German federal state and State of Saxony ministries. To revive the turboprop design, SNC should invest €80 million ($88.75 million) in DRA while the state of Saxony pledged €6.5 million. Design Forward section of a 328 The Dornier 328 is a twin-turboprop engined, regional aircraft, principally designed for short-haul passenger operators; Deutsche Aerospace often promoted the type as being a \\"third-generation airliner\\". The fuselage of the 328 employs an unusual streamlined shape, having been optimised for high cruising speeds; the aircraft is capable of higher cruise and approach speeds than most turboprop-powered aircraft, which allows it to be more readily slotted around jetliners during landing approaches. According to Deutsche Aerospace, the 328 offered the \\"lowest noise level, widest cabin, highest standing room, widest cabin floor, and widest seats in the three-abreast class\\".Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 40. The 328 is capable of operations from semiprepared airstrips and rough runways, incorporating features such as its retractable landing gear being equipped with high-floatation tyres and steerable nose gear and a gravel guard. It is equipped with a pair of Pratt and Whitney PW119C turboprop engines, which drive fully reversible Hartzell HD-E6C-3B propellers. The propeller blades generate notably less noise in comparison to their contemporary counterparts due to features such as their lower rotation speed, propeller synchrophasing, and the use of a six-blade configuration. The propeller system is dual-acting, being capable of adjusting pitch to maintain a constant engine speed. During the early 1990s, the manufacturer claimed that the use of various noise-reduction measures across the aircraft kept the internal cabin noise \\"below that of even some modern jet aircraft\\". The fuselage of 328 allows for a comfortable three-abreast, airline-style seating arrangement to be used, as well as a dense, four-abreast configuration to accommodate greater passenger numbers, of which it is able to carry a maximum of 27.\\"Dornier-328-100.\\" Sierra Nevada Corporation, 2014. A total of six cabin configurations is available for passenger and cargo operations; these include a flexible combi aircraft layout with a movable wall separating passengers and cargo, and a medical evacuation arrangement equipped with biofloors and positions for four litters and medical attendees. The 328 is pressurized, a first for Dornier-built aircraft, which was implemented to achieve a higher level of passenger comfort; the passenger cabin is designed to be more akin to those of much larger passenger aircraft.Moxon 1991, pp. 69–70. A full-sized galley, toilet, and washbasin can also be installed. Forward-facing internal view from the cockpit of an in-flight 328 The 328 is furnished with the same supercritical wing design that had been originally developed for Dornier's earlier Do 228; this wing provides the aircraft with both excellent cruise and climb capabilities. The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials in areas such as the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20%. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and glass fibre-reinforced plastic for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, pp. 38–39. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from isolator brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, p. 39. The two-man glass cockpit of the 328 is equipped with a Honeywell Primus 2000 avionics suite, and the cockpit is outfitted with an electronic flight instrument system comprising five 20 x 17.5 cm cathode ray tube (CRT) monitors. The central CRT serves as the engine-indicating and crew-alerting system, while the two inner CRTs are used as multifunctional displays and the outermost two CRTs perform as the primary flight displays. Addition avionics include a dual integrated avionics computer, a digital databus (a commercial derivative of the MIL- STD-1553 databus), dual Primus II integrated radio system, automatic flight control system, dual digital air data reference units, Primus 650 weather radar, dual mode-S transponder, enhanced ground proximity warning system, and traffic collision avoidance system.Moxon 1991, p. 70.Moxon, Barrie and Goold 1991, pp. 36, 39. Operational history In 2005, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority awarded a contract to AeroRescue to provide long-range search and rescue capability around Australia. Accordingly, five 328-100s were progressively commissioned from April 2006 to February 2007 and stationed around the Australian coastline to provide a 24-hour, 30-minute response capability. These aircraft were equipped with a comprehensive electronic sensor suite by Aerodata AG in Germany including; Israel Aerospace Industries ELTA EL/M 2022A Radar, FSI Star SAFire III Forward Looking Infra Red, Direction Finder and an ARGON ST Infra Red/Ultra Violet scanner. The aircraft are also fitted with an Aeronautical Engineers Australia dispatch system, allowing rescue stores to be dropped from the aircraft through a chute through the underwing emergency exit. These are progressively being upgraded with an in-flight-opening cargo door to allow dispatch of larger items, up to 20-man life rafts, and boat-dewatering pumps for open-water rescues.

It lies at the western foot of Mount Vesuvius, on the Bay of Naples, just southeast of the city of Naples. The medieval town of Resina () was built on the volcanic material left by the eruption of Vesuvius (79 AD) that destroyed the ancient city of Herculaneum, from which the present name is derived. Ercolano is a resort and the starting point for excursions to the excavations of Herculaneum and for the ascent of Vesuvius by bus. The town also manufactures leather goods, buttons, glass, and the wine known as Lacryma Christi (Tears of Christ). History = Ancient Herculaneum = According to legend, Herculaneum was founded by Hercules, who was returning from one of his Twelve Labours. Historically, it was most likely founded by the Oscans, an Italic tribe of the 8th century BC, and later became part of both the Etruscan and Samnite dominions. Under the control of the Romans, the city was a renowned seaside resort where some of the richest Roman citizens spent their summer vacations. It was built according to the standard model of Hippodamus of Miletus with a grid of crossing Decumans and Cardos. The houses were elegant and large and there were public buildings that were abundant and large, compared to the small number of inhabitants (estimated to be 5,000). On 5 February AD 62, the resort city suffered heavy damage from violent earthquakes. Restoration projects were still ongoing at that time and were cut short on 24 August AD 79, when Vesuvius violently erupted and completely buried the small city under thick layers of hot volcanic debris. Unlike neighboring Pompeii, which was buried under pumice and fine ash, the citizens of Herculaneum died of severe thermal shock from successions of superheated pyroclastic surges and lava flows. = Founding of Resina = After the eruption of AD 79 the area was slowly re-populated and in AD 121 the old coast road from Naples to Nocera was probably in place. In the Basilica di Santa Maria a Pugliano are two early Christian marble sarcophagi from the 2nd and 4th centuries AD which give evidence of habitation on the site of the buried Herculaneum. Unfortunately there are no historical records covering the period between the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the year 1000, but it is certain that the coast near Mount Vesuvius would have been exposed to frequent wars as a result of the peoples and armies invading the Empire. The first records of the existence of a village named Resina or Risìna, (… de alio latere est ribum de Risina… ; … de alio capite parte meridiana est resina …, etc.),Bartolomeo Capasso, Monumenta ad Neapolitani Ducatus Historiam pertinentia, Naples 1885 are from the 10th century. The etymology of the name is controversial. Some academics believe that it comes from a corruption of Rectina, the name of the Roman noblewoman from Herculaneum who asked Pliny The Elder for help during the eruption in AD 79. Other explanations are that the name could come from the Latin word raetincula, meaning the nets used by the fishermen of Herculaneum, or from the resin of trees grown on the ancient lava, or from the name of the river that flowed alongside Herculaneum. Finally some suggest that the name is the anagram of sirena (siren): a siren was the symbol of the village and the town of Resina until 1969. Documents from the 11th century indicate the presence of a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary on a hill called Pugliano whose name probably derives from Praedium Pollianum, an ancient estate outside Herculaneum whose owner was called Pollio. = Renaissance = Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano In 1418 Queen Joanna II of Naples granted the Università (villages with local governments) of Torre del Greco, Resina, Portici and Cremano to her favourite Sergianni Caracciolo and later to Antonio Carafa. Thereafter these villages remained in the possession of the Carafa family and were subject to events within the family and the wider history of the Kingdom of Naples. Resina's main industries were agriculture, fishing (including the collecting of corals, an activity performed alongside the inhabitants of Torre del Greco),Antonio Formicola, Il porto borbonico del Granatello, Napoli, 1984, pagg. 19–20 and the cutting and carving of volcanic stone. In the 16th century the worship of the Madonna di Pugliano, who was venerated in the church of Santa Maria a Pugliano, was so widespread that large numbers of pilgrims flooded in from the surrounding areas. In 1574 the church was first mentioned as Basilica pontificia; two years later it became the parish church of Resina, the parish also including the neighbouring town of Portici until 1627. In 1631 Mount Vesuvius erupted violently after a long dormant period and devastated the surrounding area, killing more than 4000 people and changing the local geography. The volcano's eruption was its second most destructive ever, exceeded only by the eruption that destroyed Pompeii and Herculaneum in AD 79. There were two lava flows that approached Resina but these were kept separate as they flowed around the hill of Pugliano, sparing the houses of the village. One of the flows filled the valley on the western side of the hill and when it solidified the village expanded onto the newly-created plain. The wide road via Pugliano was built running straight up to the basilica on the top of the hill. After about three centuries of feudalism, Resina and its neighbours Portici, Torre del Greco and Cremano liberated themselves from their status as baronial subjects in 1699 by paying 106,000 ducats to the Crown (plus an additional 2,500 ducats for ancillary expenses) as \\"baronial ransom\\". Resina paid one third of the total amount. The event is one of the most memorable in the history of Resina and the neighbouring towns. = Re-discovery of Herculaneum = Entrance to the underground theatre of ancient Herculaneum In 1709 Emmanuel Maurice, Duke of Elbeuf was constructing a residence on the Italian coast at Portici when he heard about a man who had discovered ancient marble sculptures and columns while digging a well in the nearby town of Resina. The duke bought the man's farm and began digging shafts and tunnels. He excavated statues, columns and marble sculptures, placing some of them in his Portici residence and giving others as valuable gifts to his friends and relatives and to the monarchs of Europe. The news reached King Charles VII of Naples, who was aware of the importance of the finds. He bought the duke's farm and started methodical excavations with the aim of unearthing all the valuable antiquities buried there. As the discovery of ancient Herculaneum became known around Europe, impetus was given to the Western cultural movement known as Neoclassicism and to the custom among the British and European upper-class of taking of the Grand Tour. A view of the Golden Mile street in the centre Enthusiastic about the large amounts and the beauty of the archaeological finds, the king had the summer Palace of Portici constructed, on the border with Resina. Findings of Herculaneum were housed in a dedicated part of the palace, which was open for the king's guests. The size of the collection increased after 1750, when exploration of the large suburban villa of the Pisoni family brought large amounts of wooden and marble statues to light: the two corridori (racers) or lottatori (wrestlers) and the Sleeping Mercury are the most well-known ones. Of special importance was the discovery in 1752 of the burnt papyrus scrolls of the library of the villa, known today as the Villa dei Papiri.The Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, is a punctual replica of the map of Villa dei Papiri drawn in 1751 by Karl Weber They were carefully unrolled using a special machine made by Fr. Antonio Piaggio, containing the work of the epicurean Greek philosopher Philodemus. = Growth of modern Resina = Following the king's example, nobles of the kingdom started building their summer villas and gardens next to the royal palace and the surrounding area. On the stretch of the main street called Strada Regia delle Calabrie, which is the royal street towards to the region of Calabria, from the centre of Resina to the beginning of nearby Torre del Greco, large and representative villas were constructed. This part of the street is known as the Golden Mile (Miglio d’Oro). Amongst the most outstanding buildings are the Villa Campolieto, designed by Luigi Vanvitelli, and the Villa Favorita, designed by Ferdinando Fuga. The Villa Favorita received its name from Queen Maria Carolina of Austria, because the place reminded her of her childhood's surrounding of Schönbrunn Palace in Vienna. In 1799 during the last days of the Parthenopaean Republic, final fights took place in the streets of Resina and Portici between the king's supporters and the republicans. To celebrate the return of King Ferdinand IV of Naples against the \\"atheist\\" and pro-French republic, the inhabitants of Resina constructed a chapel of thanksgiving with a crucifix on the spot that replaced the republican Tree of Freedom. On 27 June 1802, the king returned in Naples landing to the pier of Villa Favorita. During the kingdom of Joachim Murat Villa Favorita still was used for parties and celebrations held by the king and the winding and narrow leg of the Strada Regia delle Calabrie in Resina was straightened and widened throughout the town centre. = 19th to 20th centuries = The northern entrance to the Archeological Site of Herculaneum from town centre Together with the construction of the first Italian railway in 1839, some industrial facilities were established along the coast (glassworks, tanneries, train wagons, etc.) that altered the previous landscape. Nevertheless, Resina remained an agricultural town, celebrated for its fruit and healthy air and was the well- known destination for the visits to the underground Theatre of Herculaneum and the ascension to the crater of Mt. Vesuvius. In 1845 the Real Osservatorio Vesuviano (Royal Vesuvius Observatory) was inaugurated, the first in the world. In 1863 the local artist Marco De Gregorio founded the School of Resina an art movement that broke with the academic painting tradition. In 1865 the King of Italy Vittorio Emanuele II inaugurated the open-air excavations of Herculaneum. In 1880 the funicular railway on Mount Vesuvius was inaugurated, and the event inspired the world-famous Neapolitan song Funiculì, Funiculà. The funicular was repeatedly wrecked by volcanic eruptions and abandoned after the eruption of 1944. Since 1904 the Circumvesuviana railway operated from Naples to Castellammare di Stabia with a station in Resina-Pugliano, close to the Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano and the funicular to Mt. Vesuvius. In 1927 King Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy inaugurated the new entrance of the archaeological site of Herculaneum on the Miglio d’Oro, and a new street was opened some years later to join the archaeological site to the Circumvesuviana railway and funicular stations. The second oldest Italian motorway was opened in 1930 from Naples to Pompeii, with an exit in Resina. From the second half of the 19th century to modern times, Resina has been a residential and holiday place for both aristocracy and Neapolitan middle class who lived in the celebrated villas of the Miglio d’Oro or modern ones such as Villa Battista, an elegant Art Nouveau building. Among the famous people who lived or used to frequent the town have to be mentioned: the poet and writer Gabriele D’Annunzio, the scientist Arnaldo Cantani, the former Khedive of Egypt Isma’il Pasha, who opened the Suez Canal and lived six years (1879–85) during his exile in Villa Favorita, the Italian prime minister Antonio Salandra, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Carlo Sforza, King Gustav VI of Sweden, amateur archaeologist. To these ones hundreds of artists, scholars, historians, scientists, kings, Roman popes, presidents, prime ministers, ambassadors, politicians, and other celebrities came to Resina to visit the underground theatre and the archaeological site of Herculaneum and Mt. Vesuvius. Famous citizens of Resina were: Benedetto Cozzolino, who founded in 1788 a school for the deaf and dumb, the first in the Kingdom of Naples and the second in Italy after the one in Rome; Amadeo Bordiga, founder with Antonio Gramsci of the Partito Comunista d’Italia, the Communist Party of Italy; the philosopher Adriano Tilgher; the painter Alfonso Marquez as well as the already mentioned Marco De Gregorio. The MAV, The Virtual Archeological Museum In the years after WWII in via Pugliano flourished the street market of Pugliano (or Resina) that quickly became nationwide famous for the selling of used clothes (\\"pezze\\") and a mecca for seekers of vintage clothes and bargains. On 12 February 1969, following a formal request of the Town Council, the President of Italian Republic decreed the change of the name of the town from Resina to Ercolano that is the Italian version of ancient Herculaneum. In 1971 the Ente per le Ville Vesuviane was instituted and it is now a foundation, with the objective of restoring and preserving the main 18th-century villas. The villas that were first restored were Villa Campolieto, Villa Ruggiero and the seaside park of Villa Favorita and its facilities that all now host cultural events and the headquarters of cultural institutions and postgraduate School. In the 1980s and 1990s the town was hit by the industrial crisis with a dramatic growth of unemployment and crime. Since last years of the centuries started a renewed commitment for a U-turn of policy and strategies to boost social and economic growth oriented to a touristic and cultural exploitation. In 1995 the Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio (Mt.Vesuvius National Park) was created and all the area of Ercolano north of motorway is included in the Park; in 1997 the Archaeological site of Herculaneum was listed in the UNESCO World Heritage together with Pompeii and Oplonti and Mt. Vesuvius and the Miglio d'Oro were included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Unesco's Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme; in 2005 the MAV (Virtual Archeologic Museum) was opened and the open-air permanent exhibition Creator Vesevo was inaugurated with 10 stone sculptures of contemporary famous international artists lined up along the street heading to Mt. Vesuvius crater.  Main landmarks  = Archeological Site of Herculaneum = A view of Herculaneum The Archeological site of Herculaneum (in Italian: Scavi di Ercolano) is the area south of the town centre of modern Ercolano where the Roman town of Herculaneum has been excavated. Herculaneum was destroyed and buried by lava and mud during the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79 together with Pompeii, Stabiae and Oplontis. In 1997 the Herculaneum site was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Although Herculaneum was discovered before Pompeii, the excavation was so difficult that it was repeatedly interrupted in favour of the easier excavation of Pompeii. Herculaneum is smaller and less famous than Pompeii, but better preserved due to the different volcanic materials that covered the town. In Herculaneum there are many wooden remains (doors, furniture, beams) and organic goods (fruit, bread, seeds, rope) that were burnt in Pompeii. Many Herculaneum buildings still retain their upper floors either entirely or in part. The excavated area of Herculaneum consists of only one quarter of the entire ancient town because the rest of the site still lies beneath modern Ercolano. A new entrance was recently opened at the eastern side of the archaeological site with a large parking area for cars and buses, souvenir stands, and public gardens. In Corso Resina n. 123 there is the old entrance to the underground Theatre of Herculaneum, the first of the ancient town's monuments to be discovered and made famous around the world. Access to the Theatre has to be negotiated with the office of Scavi di Ercolano depending on the conditions underground. Today the archaeological site is visited by some 300,000 tourists every year. In 2012 it recorded 288,536 visitors and was the 16th most visited monument in Italy.Minbac, Ufficio Statistica, Anno 2012 = Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano = Basilica of Santa Maria a Pugliano: the high altar with the wooden statue of Madonna di Pugliano of the 14th century The Basilica Pontificia of Santa Maria a Pugliano, in Piazza Pugliano, is the main church of Ercolano and the oldest in town and the area all around Mt. Vesuvius. = Il Miglio d’Oro (The Golden Mile) = A view of the Golden Mile from Villa Ruggiero: Villa Battista on the foreground and Villa Favorita with its wood on the back. In the background the Bay of Naples with the Isle of Capri The Miglio d’Oro is the leg of Corso Resina ( the old Strada Regia per le Calabrie) in Ercolano from the Archeological Site of Herculaneum leading to Torre del Greco where are lined the largest, the finest and the most sumptuous villas designed by the best architects of that time and built in the 18th century by the noble families of the Kingdom of Naples around the Royal Palace of Portici. The most famous are Villa Campolieto, Villa Favorita and Villa Aprile. All the villas had backside gardens and woods, some of them rivaling with the ones of the Royal Palace. In 1997 the Miglio d'Oro, together with Mt.Vesuvius, was included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Unesco's Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme. Although the expression Miglio d'Oro was created in the 19th century to highlight the splendor of the buildings along the leg of old Strada Regia per le Calabrie in Ercolano (Resina) and the beginning of Torre del Greco, it was recently and inappropriately expanded to a broader area where the 121 villas of the 18th century listed by the Ente per le Ville Vesuviane were built; this area includes the Neapolitan quarters of Barra, San Giovanni a Teduccio and Ponticelli, and the towns of San Giorgio a Cremano, Portici and the whole territory of Torre del Greco. Villa Campolieto was built in 1755 and designed by Luigi Vanvitelli the architect of the Royal Palace of Caserta who enriched the original project of Mario Gioffredo. Despite its austere and simple façade on the street, the internal side facing the sea opens on a magnificent elliptic exedra with a continuous arcade that also functions as belvedere towards the bay of Naples. The staircase leading to the upper floor is one of the most monumental in private buildings: it is surrounded by large windows and evokes the one of the Royal Palace of Caserta. The rooms of the main floor (piano nobile) preserve the original paintings and decoration of Jacopo Cestaro, Fedele Fischetti and Gaetano Magri. Villa Campolieto hosts the executive office of Fondazione Ente Ville Vesuviane and The School Management Stoà. Also opens for exhibitions, conferences, fairs and festivals. Among the most remarkable events have to be mentioned: the Terrae Motus art exhibition after the earthquake of 1980 and the summer Festival delle Ville Vesuviane. Villa Favorita, also known as Real Villa della Favorita, was designed by architect Ferdinando Fuga in 1762 for the Principe di Jaci e di Campofiorito who bought and restored a pre-existent smaller building. In 1768 the prince gave a sumptuous party in honour of the King Ferdinando of Bourbon and his wife Maria Carolina of Augsburg just arrived from Vienna. The Queen liked the villa that reminded her of Vienna's Schönbrunn palace and since then was called \\"Favorita\\" (favoured). In 1792 the villa joined the Crown property and the King bought a close area by the sea so that created a great park from the main building on the street to the sea and a pier for the access by boat. It was frequently used by the royal couple and their children. While living there, the second son of the King, Leopoldo of Bourbon, enlarged the palace and built some pavilions for entertainment and recreation such as the Casino of Mosaics (so called after its interior decoration with a coloured patchwork of mother-of-pearl and porcelain scraps), the Montagne Russe (wooden switchback), two twin coffeehouses on the pier as well as balancoires and bandstands. He used to open the park to his subjects during public holiday. From 1879 and 1885 Villa Favorita hosted Isma'il Pasha, former Khedive of Egypt who was worldwide famous after the inauguration of Suez Canal. He decorated the interiors of his apartments with a Moorish style and built some Moorish gazebo in the park. In the 20th century the park was split in two: the palace with the upper park was used as military facility and the park on the sea (Parco sul Mare della Villa Favorita) was used as firmland and after the earthquake of 1980 was requisitioned by the Town Council for temporary housing the evacuated families. In the nineties the Fondazione Ente per le Ville Vesuviane acquired and restored the wood, with the pavilions and the pier and now uses it for exhibitions, concerts and other events. The main building alongside Corso Resina is remarkable for its double court and the magnificent semicircular staircase on the backside that connects the main hall of first floor to the park and its visible from Villa Campolieto. The façade was recently restored. The wood needs a major restoration. Villa Aprile also known as Villa Riario Sforza after the first owner who built it in the second half of the 18th century. It is among the largest villas of Miglio d’Oro and keeps one of the most elegant parks still intact nowadays. The author Carlo Celano Carlo Celano: Notizie del bello e del Curioso che contengono le reali Ville di Portici, Resina, lo scavamento pompeiano, Capodimonte, Cartito, Caserta e San Leucio, 1792, Napoli p. 64 described the villa as \\"la regina delle ville\\" (the queen of the villas). Between 1818 and following years the new owner, the niece of the Duke Riario Sforza, transformed the building by elevating the second floor and the woods giving the ultimate shape: the splendid fountain of Prometheus, little temples, statues, fake ruins and Roman columns, an alpine chalet with a water-lily pond, grotto and spring. From 1879 the villa belonged to the Aprile family until recent years and became a well patronized cultural and fashionable salon and also a comfortable hotel. After decades of neglect, the villa and its park were bought and destined into luxury hotel. Other interesting and nice villas of the 18th century are: Villa Ruggiero, owned by Fondazione Ente per le Ville Vesuviane, Villa Durante, Villa Granito di Belmonte, Villa Signorini and the Town Hall although the last three are not lined on the Miglio d’Oro.

It began after the end of WWII in southern Italy (1943) in order to sell cheap clothes and accessories to the impoverished population after the economic collapse of the war, but quickly became a well-known attraction for seekers of original, bizarre and old fashioned clothes. It started at the end of 1943 when Anglo-American troops used some villas and buildings on the Miglio d’Oro as barracks and storage. The lorries transporting these materials towards the motorway north of Pugliano area had to drive along via Pugliano and stop at the Circumvesuviana railway crossing. Here, some adventurous inhabitants of the area silently stole, or in some cases bargained for old parachutes and uniforms to produce bras, corsets and dresses to be sold on the street. Over the years the street market became permanent and some deals were made to import used clothes from the US, Germany and other countries. The clothes arrived at the market in bales that were opened on the street so that people could select from them. Whatever was unsold or too spoiled to be sold was recycled into new clothes or materials in Ercolano or sent to specialized factories in Prato, near Florence. Together with the old clothes the market now also sells leather and fur coats and jackets, some of them of good craftsmanship. The market flourished in the 1960s and 1970s but went to decline in the last decades of the 20th century. In recent years it has been having a slow revival. = The MAV = The Museo Archeologico Virtuale (Virtual Archeologic Museum) opened in 2005 to give a multimedial approach to the history, lifestyle and habits of ancient Herculaneum, and the tragic events of the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. It is an ideal destination for families and students and is centrally located in Via IV Novembre on the way from the Circumvesuviana train station to the northern entrance of the Archeological site from town centre. The building was erected in the late 1920s as a covered food market. Some years later was converted into school and so was operated until 1980 when suffered major damage by the earthquake and abandoned. After years of complete neglect, at the beginning of the new century the Town Council totally restored it and converted into multi-purpose cultural centre, including the museum, a bookshop and a 300-seat theatre. = Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio = The crater of Mt.Vesuvius The National Park of Mt. Vesuvius was created in 1995 by the Italian Government by establishing the Ente Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio, the body in charge of it. It includes Mt. Vesuvius and surrounding Monte Somma, that is what remains of the original larger volcano after the eruption that buried Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae and Oplontis in AD 79. It is the smallest National Park in Italy and one of the smallest in the world but it is very important due to the presence of the most famous volcano in the world. In 1997 Mt. Vesuvius as Somma-Vesuvio was included in the World Network of Biosphere Reserves under the Unesco's Man and Biosphere Reserve Programme together with the Miglio d'Oro area. Ecolano is one of the 13 towns that have their territory (or part of it) included in the area of the Park. From Ercolano starts the main street heading to the Gran Cono (12 km from town centre) where visitors can ascend on foot along a panoramic path up to the edge of the huge crater where some fumarole can be seen. Alongside the first leg of Via Osservatorio are displayed ten stone statues of the permanent exhibition Creator Vesevo that were made in 2005 by as many different international artists. According to the organization of Ente Parco Nazionale del Vesuvio, some paths in the woods around the Gran Cono are accessible. From via Osservatorio it's possible to reach the historic Osservatorio Vesuviano, that was founded in 1845 by the King Ferdinando II of Bourbon and was the first centre for volcanic studies and monitoring in the world. The visits have to be agreed with the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica of Naples.  Culture  Since the time of Roman Herculaneum, the area has attracted famous artists, poets, writers and philosophers. The Villa dei Pisoni, for instance, was an international centre of Epicurean philosophy. In the middle of the 15th century, Antonio Beccadelli, known as Il Panormita, built a villa on the seafront of Resina that was named Plinianum where the fellows of the Porticus Antonianum (also called Accademia Pontaniana after Antonio Pontano) used to gather. Following the discovery of the buried town of Herculaneum and the start of the excavations, artists, scholars and authors from all around Europe begun to converge to Resina and the ruins of Herculaneum were one of main destinations of the Grand Tour. Some of the most famous architects, painters, and sculptors of that time worked in the town to design and build the villas of the Miglio d’Oro (The Golden Mile) and many villas became important literary salons. In 1863 the local painter Marco De Gregorio started the Scuola di Resina (School of Resina), an art movement that broke with the academic tradition in favour of a more realistic and intimate vision of the world around. It had some connection with the Macchiaioli movement, and had as main interpreters, together with De Gregorio: Adriano Cecioni, Giuseppe De Nittis, Federico Rossano, Eduardo Dalbono, Nicola Palizzi and Antonino Leto. Between 1892 and 1893 Gabriele D’Annunzio was guest in Villa D’Amelio in Resina where he found inspiration for his work during those years. After the establishment of the Ente per le Ville Vesuviane and the restoration of Villa Campolieto, the town of Ercolano hosted international events such as the international exhibition of contemporary art Terrae Motus, conceived by Lucio Amelio after the earthquake of 1980. Villa Campolieto is the location of the Festival delle Ville Vesuviane and hosts the School of Management Stoà. The town is also home to the MAV, Virtual Archeological Museum, which gives an original multimedia presentation of the history of Herculaneum and the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in AD 79. In addition there is the Creator Vesevo, alongside the street leading to Mt.Vesuvius, an open air permanent exhibition of stone sculptures created by famous international artists in 2005. Economy The typical industries of Ercolano were agriculture, fishery, extraction and manufacture of lava stone, carpentry and retail. Agriculture was spread all over the town district up to the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius and enjoyed the mild weather and the fertility of the volcanic soil that made the Vesuvian yields excellent all the time. Fishery was practiced along the coast and in Tyrrhenian Sea including the coral fishing together with the neighbour Torre del Greco. The Resinesi were local stonemasons and carpenters employed to pave the main roads and to build up the villas of the 18th century on the local Miglio d’Oro street and in surrounding towns. In the 19th century the first factories were mainly settled along the coastline, already altered by the railway. Among the main plants there were a glass manufacture, tanneries, and train manufacture. After World War II the textile industry flourished around the business of Pugliano street market as well as the nursery gardening mostly on the coastal land that is more suitable for growing flowers and seeds. The need of large facilities for the expanding textile industry clashed against the programs of environment and volcanic prevention and forced many entrepreneurs of Ercolano to move to less-restricted areas of Campania region. This happened to the tanneries and other large factories. The nursery gardening has spread along the coastline south of Naples and Ercolano is one of the largest producers. The flower market on via Benedetto Cozzolino gave a boost to the industry and hosts an international year exhibition focused on cut flower. Tourism is not a main item of local income, notwithstanding of several accommodating facilities, because the archaeological site of Herculaneum and Mt. Vesuvius are a spot destination for tourists who stay in Naples or Sorrento. There are three four-star hotels, and many B&B; mostly located on the Miglio d’Oro and on the streets leading to Mt.Vesuvius. On via Benedetto Cozzolino there are many used-car traders. As concerning the figures of enterprises, the 2011 ISTAT census reports 2,092 enterprises with 4,585 employees. About one half of all (1,011) belong to trade as follows: 545 retail, 334 wholesale, 66 vehicles and motor vehicles (both retail and wholesale). Other main items are professional, scientific and technical consultancies (232 enterprises), manufacture (154), construction (151), social and health assistance (131), accommodation and restaurants (124). As it concerns their status, 21 are stock companies, 274 are limited companies, 19 co-op companies, 1,490 one-man business, professionals and freelances. In 2011 they have been recorded 16.067 income tax returns with a total amount of €346,410,631, that is €21,560 per single declarer and €6,471 per capita.

It is aimed at children ages 5 to 9 and is intended to teach children reading, basic math, and logic skills. Treasure Galaxy is part of the Super Seekers games. Background After being removed from Treasure Cove, the Master of Mischief heads off to Crystal City in deep space. After turning the harmless asteroids into menacing Disasteroids, the Master of Mischief attacks Crystal City and shatters its crystals. The Super Seekers are summoned to recover the crystal shards and save Crystal City from the Master of Mischief. Gameplay The goal of Treasure Galaxy! is to recover all of the crystals and return them to the queen in her palace. To gather crystals, the player must first capture animated fireballs called \\"sunbeams\\" and answer their riddles. If answered correctly, a sunbeam will help the player decode a cipher that must be cracked in order to access the crystals hidden in the satellites. Each stage will have a different cipher that applies to all the satellites in that particular stage. There are three separate stages, or orbits, of play, and the player may not move on to the next stage until he has learned the 4-digit passcode. The passcode can be obtained by completing various challenges posed by aliens that can be found in each stage. The challenges pertain to real-world scenarios such as using a calendar to find a certain date, tangrams, measuring with a ruler, and measuring with a scale. Difficulty of each separate category of puzzle changes according to how well the player does with that type of puzzle. At higher ranks, the game becomes more difficult, as there will be more crystals to find and disasteroids that steal star bucks. Development =Educational focus= Treasure Galaxy! is specifically designed to develop a broad range of math and critical-thinking skills within an environment of interactive and engaging game play. The program helps five-to nine-year-old children build real-world math skills, including identifying basic fractions, measuring length and weight, and locating calendar dates. Automatic educational leveling allows players to learn at appropriate and challenging rates for each individual activity. The program adjusts the level of difficulty, depending on the player's success. =Treasure series= Treasure Galaxy! is one of four games in The Learning Company's \\"Treasure\\" series along with Treasure Cove!, Treasure Mathstorm!, and Treasure Mountain!. The treasure series is a subgroup of the company's Super Seekers games. All the games in this series are math and reading comprehension oriented educational adventure games aimed at younger children.

The temple was founded in 1164 by Taira no Kiyomori for the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa. It is officially known as and belongs to the Myōhō-in temple complex. Sanjūsangen-dō is most famous for its massively long hondō (main hall) dating from 1266 (Kamakura period) and designated a National Treasure of Japan, and the collection of sculptures it houses, including 1001 standing Thousand-armed Kannon, 28 standing attendants, a statue of Fūjin and a statue of Raijin, and the principal image of the temple, a big seated statue of Thousand-armed Kannon, all of them designated National Treasures in the category of sculptures, most of them dating to the Heian to Kamakura periods.  History  Sanjūsangen-dō was founded by the famous samurai and politician Taira no Kiyomori (1118-1181) in 1164 for the cloistered Emperor Go-Shirakawa. He built the temple in the emperor's own compound Hōjūji-dono in order to gain a noble title, that of Chancellor of the Realm, becoming the first samurai to do so. Go-Shirakawa's compound was around 1100 square meters in size, divided into Minamidono (the southern estate) and Kitadono (the northern estate). When Go-Shirakawa died in 1192, he was buried in the temple's east Hokkedō (hall of the Lotus Sutra).Informative panels behind the main hall The temple complex originally included several buildings other than the hondō (main hall), including a gojūnotō (five-storied pagoda), a Kannondō (a hall of Kannon) and a Fudodō (a hall of the Four Heavenly Kings). All of these buildings were completely destroyed in 1249 by a fire that broke out in the city. The Emperor Go-Saga (1220–1272) ordered the reconstruction of the hondō, which began in 1251. The building was completed in 1266 and survives to the present day. From the original 1000 standing Thousand-armed Kannon dating from the temple's construction in the late Heian period, only 124 were saved from the fire. The Emperor also ordered 876 new Kannon statues to replace the lost ones. These were created by three groups of Buddhist sculptors, Keiha, Enpa and Inpa, during the course of 16 years.Informative panels behind the main hall A popular archery tournament known as Tōshiya (\\"passing arrow\\") was held at the west veranda of the temple for 255 years during the Edo period. The contest originated in the late 16th century dating back to 1606 when a samurai named Asaoka Heibei is said to have shot 51 arrows in rapid succession down the length of the veranda. In the beginning, archers shot arrows from the southern end of the veranda to the northern end where a curtain-like ornament was erected as a target. The contest gained popularity during the Edo period and by the late 17th century competitions between participants from the Owari and Kishū provinces were drawing big crowds. The duel between the famous warrior Miyamoto Musashi and Yoshioka Denshichirō, leader of the Yoshioka-ryū, is popularly believed to have been fought just outside Sanjūsangen-dō in 1604. In the second Sunday of January, the temple has an event known as the Rite of the Willow, where worshippers are touched on the head with a sacred willow branch to cure and prevent headaches, and a modern version of the Tōshiya, the Festival of the Great Target, is held on the west veranda, drawing roughly 2,000 participants from throughout Japan. Archers shoot arrows into targets approximately 50 - 100 centimeters in diameter and 60 meters (198 feet) away at the opposite end of the veranda.  Important features  The main deity of the temple is Sahasrabhuja-arya-avalokiteśvara or the Thousand Armed Kannon. The statue of the main deity was created by the Kamakura sculptor Tankei and is a National Treasure of Japan. The temple also contains one thousand life- size statues of the Thousand Armed Kannon which stand on both the right and left sides of the main statue in 10 rows and 50 columns. Of these, 124 statues are from the original temple, rescued from the fire of 1249, while the remaining 876 statues were constructed in the 13th century. The statues are made of Japanese cypress clad in gold leaf. The temple is 120 - meter long. Around the 1000 Kannon statues stand 28 statues of guardian deities. There are also two famous statues of Fūjin and Raijin. =Guardian deities and Hinduism= The 28 guardian deities stand in front of the Buddhist Kannon have their origins in Sanskrit texts of Hinduism. These ideas came to Japan through China, and the presence of both Hindu and Buddhist deities at Sanjūsangen-dō temple in Kyoto suggest various theories of the origin and spread of the spiritual and cultural ideas from India to east Asia.Mark M.

She left a substantial legacy of recordings. Career Born in Merseburg, Schumann trained for a singing career in Berlin and Dresden. She made her stage debut in Hamburg in 1909. Her initial career started in the lighter soubrette roles that expanded into mostly lyrical roles, some coloratura roles, and even a few dramatic roles. She remained at the Hamburg State Opera until 1919, also singing during the 1914/1915 season at the Metropolitan Opera, New York. Schumann and Richard Strauss From 1919 until 1938, she was a star of the Vienna State Opera. Her most famous role was that of Sophie in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier, but she also excelled in Mozart, taking the roles of Pamina in Die Zauberflöte, Zerlina in Don Giovanni, Blonde in Die Entführung aus dem Serail and Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro. The conductor Karl Alwin was her second husband from 1920 until 1938. In 1938, she emigrated to New York City where she lived until her death on 23 April 1952, aged 64. During World War II she gave recitals but mainly taught singing, privately and at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. After the war she gave many recitals in Europe, making a particularly successful comeback in England. She was a much-loved artist, admired for her vivacity, elegance, and beauty. She was closely connected with Richard Strauss, Otto Klemperer, Lotte Lehmann, Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtwängler, and other leading musicians of the first half of the 20th century.

Pictured is the W. M. Keck Observatory, an optical interferometer. The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to astronomy: Astronomy - studies the universe beyond Earth, including its formation and development, and the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects (such as galaxies, planets, etc.) and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of Earth (such as the cosmic background radiation). Nature of astronomy Astronomy can be described as all the following: * An academic discipline: one with academic departments, curricula and degrees; national and international societies; and specialized journals. * A scientific field (a branch of science) - widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies it  A natural science - one that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the natural world using empirical and scientific methods. * A branch or field of space science * A hobby or part-time pursuit for the satisfaction of personal curiosity or appreciation of beauty, the latter especially including astrophotography. Branches of astronomy * Astrobiology - studies the advent and evolution of biological systems in the universe. * Astrophysics - branch of astronomy that deals with the physics of the universe, including the physical properties of celestial objects, as well as their interactions and behavior. Among the objects studied are galaxies, stars, planets, exoplanets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background; and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition. The subdisciplines of theoretical astrophysics are:  Compact objects - this subdiscipline studies very dense matter in white dwarfs and neutron stars and their effects on environments including accretion.  Physical cosmology - origin and evolution of the universe as a whole. The study of cosmology is theoretical astrophysics at its largest scale.  Computational astrophysics - The study of astrophysics using computational methods and tools to develop computational models.  Galactic astronomy - deals with the structure and components of our galaxy and of other galaxies.  High energy astrophysics - studies phenomena occurring at high energies including active galactic nuclei, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, quasars, and shocks.  Interstellar astrophysics - study of the interstellar medium, intergalactic medium and dust.  Extragalactic astronomy - study of objects (mainly galaxies) outside our galaxy, including Galaxy formation and evolution.  Stellar astronomy - concerned with Star formation, physical properties, main sequence life span, variability, stellar evolution and extinction.  Plasma astrophysics - studies properties of plasma in outer space.  Relativistic astrophysics - studies effects of special relativity and general relativity in astrophysical contexts including gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and black holes.  Solar physics - Sun and its interaction with the remainder of the Solar System and interstellar space. * Planetary Science - study of planets, moons, and planetary systems.  Atmospheric science - study of atmospheres and weather.  Exoplanetology - various planets outside of the Solar System  Planetary formation - formation of planets and moons in the context of the formation and evolution of the Solar System.  Planetary rings - dynamics, stability, and composition of planetary rings  Magnetospheres - magnetic fields of planets and moons  Planetary surfaces - surface geology of planets and moons  Planetary interiors - interior composition of planets and moons  Small Solar System bodies - smallest gravitationally bound bodies, including asteroids, comets, and Kuiper belt objects. * Astronomy divided by general technique used for astronomical research:  Astrometry - study of the position of objects in the sky and their changes of position. Defines the system of coordinates used and the kinematics of objects in our galaxy.  Observational astronomy - practice of observing celestial objects by using telescopes and other astronomical apparatus. It is concerned with recording data. The subdisciplines of observational astronomy are generally made by the specifications of the detectors: * Radio astronomy - Above 300 µm * Submillimetre astronomy - 200 µm to 1 mm * Infrared astronomy - 0.7–350 µm * Optical astronomy - 380–750 nm * Ultraviolet astronomy - 10–320 nm * X-ray astronomy - 0.01–10 nm * Gamma-ray astronomy - Below 0.01 nm * Cosmic ray astronomy - Cosmic rays, including plasma * Neutrino astronomy - Neutrinos * Gravitational wave astronomy - Gravitons  Photometry - study of how bright celestial objects are when passed through different filters  Spectroscopy - study of the spectra of astronomical objects * Other disciplines that may be considered part of astronomy:  Archaeoastronomy  Astrochemistry History of astronomy History of astronomy * History of the Center of the Universe  Geocentric model  Heliocentrism * Copernican heliocentrism * Tychonic system * Archaeoastronomy  Archaeoastronomy and Vedic chronology * Pretelescopic astronomy  Babylonian astronomy  Chinese astronomy  Egyptian astronomy  Greek astronomy  Hebrew astronomy  Indian astronomy  Islamic astronomy  Russian astronomy  Astronomy in the Middle Ages * Science in Medieval Western Europe * Astronomy in medieval Islam * History of astronomy in the Renaissance  Scientific developments during the Scientific Revolution * Patronage in astronomy * Copernican Revolution  Copernican heliocentrism  Nicolaus Copernicus * On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres  Tycho Brahe * Tychonic system  Galileo Galilei * Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems defense of the heliocentric system written by Galileo, which led to his trial and house arrest by the Inquisition. * Invention of the telescope  History of visible-light astronomy * History of astronomy in the Age of Reflection * Radio astronomy#History of radio astronomy * History of X-ray astronomy * History of infrared astronomy * History of gamma-ray astronomy * History of supernova observation  List of supernovae Basic astronomical phenomena * Atmosphere * Celestial pole * Eclipse * Ecliptic * Cosmic rays * Kepler's laws * Doppler effect * Nutation * Orbit * Perturbation * Precession * Proper motion * Redshift * Solar eclipse * Tides * Zodiac  Astronomical objects  Astronomical object =Solar System= * Solar System * Geology of solar terrestrial planets * List of Solar System objects  List of Solar System objects by size * Galilean satellites * Halley's comet Sun Sun * Location  Milky Way * Solar System * Stellar classification  Stellar classification#Class G * Internal structure  Standard Solar Model  Solar core  Radiation zone  Convection zone * Stellar atmosphere  Photosphere * Supergranulation * Granule * Facula * Sunspot  Chromosphere * Plage * Spicule * Moreton wave  Solar corona * Solar transition region * Coronal hole * Coronal loop * Coronal mass ejection * Solar prominence * Helmet streamer * Solar variation  Solar cycle * List of solar cycles  Solar maximum  Solar minimum  Wolf number  Solar flare  Helioseismology * Heliosphere  Solar wind * Heliospheric current sheet  Heliosphere#Termination shock  Heliosphere#Heliosheath  Heliosphere#Heliopause  Bow shock * Related phenomena  Solar dynamo  Solar eclipse  Sunlight  Solar energy * Equipment used to study the Sun  Solar telescope  Planets  * Planet  Features * Natural satellites (moons) * Planetary rings * Planets of the Solar System  Mercury  Venus  Earth * Moon  Mars * Moons of Mars  Jupiter * Moons of Jupiter * Rings of Jupiter  Saturn * Moons of Saturn * Rings of Saturn  Uranus * Moons of Uranus * Rings of Uranus  Neptune * Moons of Neptune * Rings of Neptune * Dwarf planets of the Solar System  Ceres  Pluto * Moons of Pluto  Haumea * Moons of Haumea  Makemake  Eris * Dysnomia  Small Solar System bodies  Small Solar System body * Asteroids  Minor planets  :Category:Asteroid groups and families * Vulcanoid asteroids * Near-Earth asteroids * Asteroid belt * Trojan asteroid * Centaur * Neptune Trojans * Minor planet moons * Meteoroids * 2 Pallas * 3 Juno * 4 Vesta * 10 Hygiea  List of asteroids  Meanings of asteroid names * Trans-Neptunian objects Kuiper belt * Plutinos  90482 Orcus  28978 Ixion * Cubewanos  * 20000 Varuna * * * 50000 Quaoar * 38628 Huya * Scattered disc * * * 90377 Sedna  Comets  List of periodic comets  List of non-periodic comets  Damocloids  Hills cloud  Oort cloud = Extrasolar planets = * Extrasolar planet - planet outside the Solar System.

Roberto A. Rivera-Soto (born November 10, 1953) is a former Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the State of New Jersey, U.S.A. His seven-year term expired on August 31, 2011, and he was not nominated to another term. Since leaving the court, he has resumed practicing law, as a partner with the Ballard Spahr law firm, in their Cherry Hill, New Jersey, office. Early life Born in New York City but raised in Puerto Rico, Rivera-Soto graduated with high honors from the Colegio de Nuestra Señora del Pilar, Río Piedras, Puerto Rico in 1970. He graduated from Haverford College as the José Padín Scholar in 1974. At Cornell University School of Law, Rivera-Soto was a Charles K. Burdick Scholar and a member of the Moot Court Board. He received his J.D. from Cornell in 1977.Union City High School Class of 2010 Commencement program; June 23, 2010 Career =Business and legal activities= Rivera-Soto was a member of the Board of Directors of the \\"Please Touch Museum\\", a member of the Board of Directors of the New Jersey Development Authority for Small Businesses, Minorities and Women's Enterprises, an alternate member of the Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board of the State Bar of Nevada, and a former Instructor in Trial Advocacy at Rutgers School of Law—Newark. He had previously served as senior vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary of Caesars World, and was also vice president, general counsel and corporate secretary of Greate Bay Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. From 1980 to 1983, he was a litigation associate at Fox Rothschild. From 1978 to 1980, he served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In 1977, Justice Rivera-Soto was an intern in the Office of the District Attorney of Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Justice Rivera-Soto is currently a Certified Mediator in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, member and the current chair of the District VII Ethics Committee of the Supreme Court of New Jersey. Rivera-Soto's work as an Assistant United States Attorney was recognized by the Attorney General of the United States in 1980 when he received the United States Department of Justice's \\"Director's Award for Superior Performance as an Assistant United States Attorney\\". He also received commendations from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of the United States Treasury Department and the United States Customs Service. When he was nominated, Justice Rivera-Soto was a partner at Fox Rothschild, with offices in Princeton, New Jersey and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Justice Rivera-Soto was nominated by Governor James E. McGreevey on April 20, 2004 to serve on the Supreme Court. He was confirmed by the New Jersey Senate on June 10, 2004, and was sworn in as an Associate Justice by Justice Virginia Long on September 1, 2004 in a private ceremony. On September 14, 2004, he reaffirmed the oath of office in a public ceremony at the Trenton War Memorial. =Supreme Court service= The New Jersey Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct filed a complaint against Justice Rivera-Soto, only the second time in its 33-year history that the Committee filed against a Justice of the Supreme Court. The complaint alleged that Rivera-Soto used his influence as member of the Supreme Court to benefit his son in a dispute with his son and a classmate that escalated into a legal matter.Ramirez, Anthony. \\"New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Accused of Ethics Violation\\", The New York Times, May 13, 2007. Accessed August 11, 2008. Justice Rivera-Soto did not fight the complaint, and the Advisory Committee recommended that the Supreme Court censure the Justice for his actions. The New Jersey Supreme Court, with Justice Rivera-Soto not participating, accepted the report and recommendation of the Advisory Committee and censured the Justice.\\"Justice chided for intervening in son's dispute\\", USA Today, July 20, 2007. Accessed August 11, 2008. The censure, which is the second time the Court has censured a sitting member in more than thirty years, carried no suspension or reduction in pay, and ended the ethics matter. On December 10, 2010, Rivera-Soto stated in an \\"abstaining opinion\\" in an otherwise non-controversial case that he would abstaining from voting on all Supreme Court decisions for an indefinite period due to his belief that the current Court membership violated the State Constitution. A majority of the Court responded in a concurring opinion that the makeup of the Court was constitutional.http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/opinions/supreme/A6909HenryvHumanServices.pdf The dispute centered around the decision of Chief Justice Stuart Rabner in September 2010 to temporarily assign the Presiding Judge of the Appellate Division, Edwin Stern, to fill a long-term vacancy on the Supreme Court, which resulted from an ongoing stalemate between Republican Governor Chris Christie and the Democratic-controlled State Senate over an appointment to fill the vacancy. The New Jersey State Constitution authorizes the Chief Justice to make such temporary assignments when \\"necessary\\"; Rivera-Soto asserted that the temporary appointment was not \\"necessary\\" and was therefore unconstitutional. The president of the Senate called on Rivera-Soto to resign due to his announced intention to refrain from participating in Court decisions,http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/state/nj-supreme-court-justice- rivera-soto-abstaining-from-decisions-in-protest as did the New York Times, saying that Rivera-Soto's move \\"appear[ed] to be driven by politics, not principle.\\"Editorial (2010-12-16) The Politicization of a Respected Court, New York Times On January 3, 2011, Rivera-Soto sent a letter to Governor Christie indicating that he did not wish to be reappointed when his initial seven-year term on the Court expired in September 2011.http://www.newjerseynewsroom.com/state/nj-supreme-court-justice-roberto- rivera-soto-to-resign On January 12, 2011, Rivera-Soto participated in a court decision and wrote an opinion indicating that he had reconsidered his position and would participate in future cases where Judge Stern's vote did not affect the outcome of the case.http://blogs.app.com/capitolquickies/2011/01/12/rivera-soto-reverses- course-will-vote-in-some-supreme-court-cases/ On September 1, 2011, Justice Anne M. Patterson was sworn in to succeed Rivera-Soto. = Federal Court Appointment as a Special Master = Justice Rivera-Soto's abilities and experience also are acknowledged and recognized in our federal courts. On August 2, 2017, the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey appointed Justice Rivera-Soto as special master in a long-running case, Williams, et al. v. BASF Catalysts, LLC., et al., Civil Action No. 11-1754. As described by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the plaintiffs in Williams, a putative class action, allege that \\"BASF Catalysts LLC and Cahill Gordon & Reindel conspired to prevent thousands of asbestos-injury victims from obtaining fair tort recoveries for their injuries.\\" Personal life Rivera-Soto is married to the former Mary Catherine Mullaney; they have three sons, Adam, Christian and Nathan.

If an obligate parasite cannot obtain a host it will fail to reproduce. This is opposed to a facultative parasite, which can act as a parasite but does not rely on its host to continue its life-cycle. Obligate parasites have evolved a variety of parasitic strategies to exploit their hosts. Holoparasites and some hemiparasites are obligate. It is advantageous for the parasite to preserve the health of their host when this is compatible with their nutritional and reproductive requirements, except when the death of the host is necessary for transmission.Combes, C. (1997) Fitness of Parasites: Pathology and Selection International Journal for Parasitology 27 (1): 1–10. Species Obligate parasitism is exhibited in a range of organisms, with examples in viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.Balashov, Yu.S. (2011) Parasitism and Ecological Parasitology. Entomological Review 91 (9): 1216–1223. They are unable to complete their development without passing through at least one parasitic stage which is necessary to their life-cycle. Whether one regards viruses as living organisms or not, they cannot reproduce except by means of resources within living cells. Accordingly, it is convenient and customary to regard them as obligate intracellular parasites. Among the Vespidae family, Vespula austriaca is an example of an obligate reproductive parasite; its common host is Vespula acadica. In the genus Bombus, B. bohemicus is an obligate parasite of B. locurum, B. cryptarum, and B. terrestris. Host- parasite interaction =Life-cycle= Parasitic life cycles involve the exploitation of at least one host. Parasites that infect a single species are said to have direct life-cycles.May, R. M. & Anderson, R. M. (1979) Population biology of infectious diseases. Nature 280: 455–461. For example, the hookworm species Necator americanus. Parasites that infect more than one host are said to have a complex or indirect life-cycle. For example, the malaria plasmodium. Intermediate or final Host An intermediate or secondary host is exploited by the parasite only for a short transition period. A final or primary host is exploited by the parasite and is the only location in which the parasite is able to reach maturity and if possible, reproduce sexually. For example, Ribeiroia ondatrae uses Ramshorn snail as its first intermediate host, amphibians and fish as second intermediate hosts and birds as definitive hosts.Goodman, B. A. & Johnson, PTJ. (2011) Disease and extended phenotype: Parasites control host performance and survival through induced changes in body plan. PLoS ONE 6(5):1–10. =Parasitic permanence= Obligate parasites may not necessarily spend all of their time behaving as parasites. When a parasite is permanent, a number of generations occur in or on the host of an infested individual. Head lice are an example of this. Temporary parasites are organisms whose parasitic mode of life is limited to a few or even one stage of development. An example of this is the larval stage of harvest mites, while the adult stage is non-parasitic. =Location on host= The parasite may live outside of the host ectoparasite; for example, a tick. Alternatively, the parasite may live within the host endoparasite; for example, the fluke. An obligate parasite that does not live directly in or on the host, but rather acts at a distance for example, a cuckoo which hatches and is raised by non- relatives is known as a brood parasite. =Invasion strategies= In order to establish infestation in a susceptible host, obligate parasites must evade defences before, during and after entry into the host. Due to the wide range of obligate parasite types, it is impossible to identify a general invasion strategy. Intracellular parasites use various strategies to invade cells and subvert cellular signalling pathways. Most bacteria and viruses undergo passive uptake, where they rely on the host cell for uptake. However, apicomplexans engage in active entry.Sibley, L. D. (2004) Parasite invasion strategies. Science 304(5668): 284–253. One obligate wasp parasite, Polistes atrimandibularis, infiltrates their hosts' colony by modifying their chemical signature to match that of the hosts'. This tricks the host wasps into thinking the parasite is one of their own. Evasion of host defences A number of obligate intracellular parasites have evolved mechanisms for evading their hosts' cellular defences, including the ability to survive in distinct cellular compartments.Hackstadt, T. (1998) The diverse habitats of obligate intracellular parasites. Current Opinion in Microbiology 1: 82–87. One of the mechanisms that hosts employ in their attempt to reduce the replication and spread of pathogens is apoptosis (programmed cell death). Some obligate parasites have developed ways to suppress this phenomenon, for example Toxoplasma gondii although the mechanism is not yet fully understood.Laliberté, J. & Carruthers, V.B. (2008) Host cell manipulation by the human pathogen toxoplasma gondii. Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences 65: 1900–1915. Manipulation of host behaviour Changes in a host’s behaviour following infection with obligate parasites are extremely common.Poulin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. International Journal for Parasitology 5 (12): 1371–1383. Unusual behaviour observed in infected individuals is noted, and if its complexity suggests that this behaviour will benefit the transmission of the parasite, then this is said to be an example of adaptive manipulation.Hughes, D. (2013) Pathways to understanding the extended phenotype of parasites in their hosts. The Journal of Experimental Biology 216: 142–147. However, there is a difficulty in demonstrating changes in behaviour are the result of a selective process favouring transmission of the parasite.Combes, C. (1991) Ethological aspects of parasite transmission. The American Naturalist 138 (4): 866–880. It has been suggested that these changes may merely be a side-effect of infection.McNair D. M. & Timmons E. H. 1977. Effects of Aspiculuris tetraptera and Syphacia obvelata on exploratory behaviour of an inbred mouse strain. Laboratory Animal Science 27:38–42. Most behaviour changes have not been demonstrated to lead to fitness gains in either the host or the parasite.Pullin, R. (1995) “Adaptive” changes in the behaviour of parasitized animals: A critical review. International Journal for Parasitology 25 (12): 1371–1383. An example of this behaviour is the attraction of rats to cat urine after infection with Toxoplasma gondii.Berdoy, M.F., Webster, J. P & MacDonald, D. W. (2000) Fatal Attraction in rats infected with Toxoplasma gondii. Proceedings of the Royal Society B 267:1591–1594. =Extended phenotype= In some cases the behaviour we observe in an organism is not due to the expression of their genes, but rather to the genes of parasites infecting them. This behaviour is an extended phenotype. =Evolution of host behaviour manipulation= Three main evolutionary routes have been suggested for the appearance of host behaviour manipulation by parasites. The first is a parasite driven scenario of manipulation, while the second and third are host driven scenarios of manipulation. #Manipulation sensu stricto (extended phenotype- abhorrent behaviour displayed by parasitised hosts results from the expression of the parasites genes) this capacity could have been the product of natural selection in an ancestral parasite with the trait.Adamo, S. A. (2012) The strings of the puppet master: How parasites change host behaviour in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. & Thomas, F. (Eds.), Host Manipulation by Parasites (pp. 36–51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. #The mafia-like strategy- retaliation for non-compliance (eg.great spotted cuckoo and magpie) magpies that eject the cuckoos eggs from their nest suffer a much greater rate of cuckoo predation. #The exploitation of compensatory responses induce host compensatory responses since these may at least partially match with the transmission routes of parasites. E.g. the sexually transmitted ectoparasite Chrysomelobia labidomerae, parasitizing the leaf beetle host Labidomera clivicollis~ infected males exhibit increased sexual behaviour and as a result enhance inter- and intra- sexual contacts (copulation and competition) which provide more opportunities for parasite transmission.Abbot, P. & Dll, L. M. (2001). Sexually transmitted parasites and sexual selection in the milkweed leaf beetle, Labidomera clivicollis. Oikos 92: 91–100 It has been suggested that extended phenotype behaviours are not adaptive, but are Exaptative.Gould, S. J. & Vrba, E.S. (1982) Exaptation: a missing term in the science form. Paleobiology. 8:4–15. While they may have a benefit for the parasitic organism, they did not arise with the intention of this benefit. Parasitic mimicry in brood parasites The cowbird and cuckoo require the nests and parental care of other passerines in order for their young to fledge. These are known as brood parasites. The parasitic bird species mimics egg patterns and colours of the host species, which reduces egg rejection.May, R. M., & Robinson, S.K. (1984) Population dynamics of avian brood parasitism. The American Naturalist 126(4):475–494. The chicks of some species are able to manipulate host behaviour by making rapid calls that mimic the sound made by up to four of the host chicks.Kilner, R. M., & Davies, N. B. (1999). How selfish is a cuckoo chick? Animal Behaviour 58:797–808. Mimicry of the host species also occurs in the paper wasp species Polistes semenowi and Polistes sulcifer and the bumblebee species Bombus bohemicus, with the parasite changing its proportions of cuticular hydrocarbons, species- and colony- specific identifying chemicals, to match that of the usurped host species.Kreuter, Kirsten; Elfi Bunk (November 23, 2011). \\"How the social parasitic bumblebee Bombus bohemicus sneaks into power of reproduction\\". Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 66 (3): 475–486. doi:10.1007/s00265-011-1294-z. Retrieved 21 September 2015.Sledge, M.F., Dani, F.R., Cervo, R., Dapporto, L., Turillazzi, S. (2001). “Recognition of social parasites as nestmates: adoption of colony-specific host cuticular odours by the paper wasp parasite Polistes sulcifer”.

Several butterfly species will also exhibit brood parasitic behavior. An example is Niphanda fusca, a butterfly that will release cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) to trick the host ant, C. japonicus, into adopting the larva as their own in their own nest. The ant will then raise the larva of the butterfly, feeding it directly from mouth-to-mouth, until it pupates.Masaru K Hojo, Ayako Wada-Katsumata, Toshiharu Akino, Susumu Yamaguchi, Mamiko Ozaki, Ryohei Yamaoka (2009). Chemical disguise as particular caste of host ants in the ant inquiline parasite Niphanda fusca (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae). Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2009 276 551–558; DOI: 10.1098/rspb.2008.1064. It is proposed that this mimicry has evolved through two processes: either as coevolutionary responses to host defences against brood parasites or modifying pre-existing host provisioning strategies.Langmore, N. E. & Spottiswoode, C. N. (2012) Visual Trickery in avian brood parasites in Hughes, D.P., Brodeur, J. & Thomas, F. (Eds.), Host Manipulation by Parasites (pp. 36–51).Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. Competition between the parasite and host young for parental resources might lead to exaggeration of the aspects of the signal that most effectively exploit host parents.Hauber, M. E. & Kilner, R. M. (2007) Coevolution, communication and host-chick mimicry in parasitic finches: who mimics whom? Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 61: 497–503. The parasitic young are likely to experience stronger selection for exaggerated signals than host young, because they are unrelated to the other chicks in the nest and therefore under selection to behave more selfishly.Lichtensten, G. (2001). Low success of shiny cowbird chicks parasitizing rufous-bellied thrushes: chick-chick competition or parental discrimination? Animal Behaviour 61:401–413. Evolution of obligate parasitism Current theory in evolutionary biology indicates that host-parasite relationships may evolve towards equilibrial states of severe disease.Ewald, P.W. (1983). Host-parasite relations, vectors, and the evolution of disease severity. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 14:465–485. This differs from the conventional belief that commensalism is the ideal equilibrium for both the host and parasite.

After the rule of Alexandru I Aldea (ended in 1436), the house was split by the conflict between the Dănești and the Drăculești, both of which claimed legitimacy. Several late rulers of the Craiovești claimed direct descent from the House after its eventual demise, including Neagoe Basarab, Matei Basarab, Constantin Șerban, Șerban Cantacuzino, and Constantin Brâncoveanu. Rulers usually mentioned as members of the House include (in chronological order of first rule) Mircea the Elder, Dan II, Vlad II Dracul, Vlad III the Impaler, Vlad the Monk, Radu IV the Great, and Radu of Afumați. Name and origins The dynasty was named after Basarab I, who gained the independence of Wallachia from the Kingdom of Hungary.

Controverse istorice, pages 135–138 and 371–386. origin and most likely meant \\"father ruler\\". Basar was the present participle of the verb \\"to rule\\", derivatives attested in both old and modern Kypchak languages. The Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga believed the second part of the name, -aba (\\"father\\"), to be an honorary title, as recognizable in many Cuman names, such as Terteroba, Arslanapa, and Ursoba. Basarab's father Thocomerius also bore an allegedly Cuman name, identified as Toq-tämir, a rather common Cuman and Tatar name in the 13th century. The Russian chronicles around 1295 refer to a Toktomer, a prince of the Mongol Empire present in Crimea. The Cuman or Pecheneg origin of the name is, however, only a conjecture and a matter of dispute among historians. Contemporaries constantly identified Basarab as a Vlach. Charles I of Hungary speaks of him as ' (\\"Bazarab, our treacherous Vlach\\"). Genealogy The following genealogical tree is an oversimplified version, meant to show the ruling princes, their documented brothers and sisters, and the spouses/extramarital liaisons of those who had ruling heirs, following the conventions: * Ruling princes have their name emphasized and their ruling years in Wallachia. * Several members of House of Basarab ruled in Moldavia; those reigning years are marked with M. * Small numbers at the end of each name are meant to indicate the mother of each offspring. * There are two branches of the dynasty: Drăculeşti (DR) and Dăneşti (DA) * If the prince died while ruling, the last year is preceded by a cross. * Spouses and extramarital liaisons are separated by a horizontal line.

Also, even Queen Elizabeth II herself is descended from Princess Stanca of Basarab (1518?-1601), through the eight generation lineage of Claudine Rhédey von Kis-Rhéde of Erdőszentgyörgy, an Austro- Hungarian Countess from the Teck-Cambridge family, making Elizabeth a fifteenth great-grandniece to Prince Vlad III of Dracul/Dracula.

Unveiled in 2004, the designer sought a joint venture with a business aircraft manufacturer before a $1.2–1.4 billion development in 7–8 years. Aerion received 50 letters-of-intent before enlarging the design as the Aerion AS2 in 2014. Powered by two Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engines, the $80 million aircraft would transport 8–12 passengers up to Mach 1.6 and up to . Development In 2003, Aerion commenced a search for a large aerospace partner, including Bombardier Aerospace and Dassault Aviation. The SBJ project was unveiled at the 2004 NBAA convention, backed by US billionaire Robert Bass, with introduction targeted at 2011 for a $1.2–1.4 billion development cost, anticipating a 250–300 aircraft civil market over 10 years. Aerion then planned wind tunnel testing in the second half of 2005, before partnerships and detailed design. Global Express lead designer John Holding joined Aerion in 2008 to lead advanced design. Each customer put a $250,000 deposit. By 2010, the company claimed 50 letters-of-intent. By then, Aerion sought a joint venture with a business aircraft manufacturer for deliveries five to six years later. In March 2012, UK-based Indigo Lyon joined Swiss ExecuJet Aviation Group as sales agents outside North America. By October 2013, the company expected flight testing to begin in 2019, to reach market in 2021. Aerion believes that their design will find a market, despite the US ban on supersonic flight, whereas Gulfstream views the ban as prohibitive. In 2014, the design was updated as the Aerion AS2, with length and takeoff weight increased to accommodate customer requests. Design Aerion SBJ Model The $80 million aircraft would transport 8–12 passengers up to Mach 1.6 and up to . It would have a conventional aluminium fuselage and a composite supersonic natural laminar flow wing, with existing Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 engine for a 40,800 kg (90,000 lb) gross-weight. When necessary, it could also cruise efficiently just below the speed of sound at Mach .95-.99. If produced, it would allow practical non-stop travel from Europe to North America and back within one business day. The Aerion SBJ's key enabling technology, supersonic natural Laminar flow, has been conclusively demonstrated in transonic wind tunnel tests and in supersonic flight tests conducted in conjunction with NASA. In the summer of 2010, an Aerion-designed calibration fixture was tested aboard a NASA F-15B. The experiments were intended to influence future laminar flow airfoil manufacturing standards for surface quality and assembly tolerances. A second test surface was flown during the first half of 2013, its design guided by the 2010 test. The new test surface was designed to provide large extents of laminar flow and be shaped so boundary layer instabilities grow relatively slowly and smoothly. These characteristics should facilitate good boundary layer imaging of the roughness and step-height experiments performed in next phase.

In combustion engines, idle speed is generally measured in revolutions per minute (rpm) of the crankshaft. At idle speed, the engine generates enough power to run reasonably smoothly and operate its ancillaries (water pump, alternator, and, if equipped, other accessories such as power steering), but usually not enough to perform useful work, such as moving an automobile. Car, truck, and motorcycle engines For a passenger car engine, idle speed is customarily between 600 and 1000 rpm. For medium and heavy duty trucks, it is approximately 600 rpm. For many single-cylinder motorcycle engines, idle speed is set between 1200 and 1500 rpm. Two-cylinder motorcycle engines are often set around 1000 rpm. If the engine is operating a large number of accessories, particularly air conditioning, the idle speed must be raised to ensure that the engine generates enough power to run smoothly and operate the accessories. Most air conditioning-equipped engines have an automatic adjustment feature in the carburetor or fuel injection system that raises the idle when the air conditioning is running. Engines modified for power at high engine speeds, such as auto racing engines, tend to have very rough idle unless the idle speed is raised significantly. Idle speed may refer to the idle creep of a vehicle with an automatic transmission. Aircraft engines Commercial aircraft descend with a minimum thrust, that is, the engines are operating at idle speed. This situation happens when an aircraft is gliding or landing.

It was formally dissolved in late 2014 with its official Web site no longer active.http://www.canadianislamiccongress.com The group was founded by Mohamed Elmasry of the University of Waterloo, a world expert in microchip design, with a 1994 meeting of Muslim leaders from across the country and it was formally incorporated as a non-profit organization in 1998. Issues =Israeli-Palestinian Conflict= In March 2006, the CIC issued a communique in which it condemned the government of Stephen Harper for \\"blindly following the lead of Washington and of the influential pro-Israel Jewish lobby in both countries.\\" The CIC called Canada's withdrawal of all aid and support to the Gaza Strip \\"a resounding slap in the face to Canadian values... It makes a mockery of our traditional stand as a nation concerned with peace and justice.\\" The CIC also stated that in refusing to recognize the Hamas government elected in the Palestinian territories, \\"Prime Minister Harper and his government are saying loudly and clearly that Canada no longer cares about the plight of Palestine and Palestinians ... This is beyond hypocrisy; it is a shameful devaluation of Canada's international reputation for fair-minded, ethical and constructive diplomacy.\\" In January 2008, the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation issued a media communique which stated \\"the Apartheid regime of the Jewish state escalated its genocidal crimes against the indigenous people of Palestine\\" and that \\"Palestinians continue to endure death, deprivation and destruction under more than 40 years of brutal Israeli occupation that has become an insidious and unremitting genocide.\\" The communique concluded by stating that \\"The world can no longer afford to stand by and watch from the sidelines as an entire people slowly bleeds to death.\\" =2008 essay contest= In 2008 the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) launched an essay contest that \\"invites Canadian high school and university students (ages 17 through 27) to write an essay on the theme \\"The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\\" and is part of activities commemorating the 60th anniversary of Al Nakba - the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their homeland in 1947-48.\\" Bnai Brith Canada, a Canadian Jewish Organization, criticized the contest, stating that it is a \\"blatant propagandistic initiative that distorts reality, delegitimizing the existence of the Jewish state in any shape or form. The national essay contest announced by these groups encouraging youth to write on \\"Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine\\", is based on the false assumption that the Jewish presence in the Jewish People's ancestral homeland is illegal\\" and that \\"This sham of a contest joins together Canadian-Arab groups, which purport to reflect mainstream positions, but which clearly hold extremist notions that deny Israel's right to exist.\\" The Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation (CAF) criticized B'nai B'rith Canada, stating that \\"This call to shutdown academic research and free speech is typical of B’nai Brith's contempt for the basic principles of academic institutions. These tactics of intimidation are becoming an all too common refrain of pro- Israel organizations, and are simply designed to stem the growing public awareness of Israel's apartheid policies\\" and that \\"Israel was founded upon the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people. Between 1947 and 1948, nearly 800,000 Palestinians were expelled from their homes and lands and over 500 Palestinian villages and neighborhoods were destroyed, and their inhabitants prevented from ever returning to their homeland.\\" =Relations with non-Muslims= The CIC has established \\"Canadian Islam Awareness Week\\" held each October in an effort to improve understanding of the Muslim community by non-Muslims. It has also worked with mosques across the country to organize \\"open houses\\" each fall where non-Muslim neighbours are invited into mosques. It has also lobbied provincial education ministries to make a high school course on world religions compulsory. Explaining the initiative, CIC vice-president Valiante said \\"We don't want schools to preach our religion, but we live in a complex world and religions play a large role, young people need to be given a chance to understand them.\\"Carmichael, Amy, \\"Muslim Canadians say that year after September 11 they feel disliked by others\\", Canadian Press, September 9, 2002 =National Post= CIC criticism Since 1998, the CIC has been active monitoring media coverage for anti-Muslim or anti-Islam sentiment and has issued reports highlighting its findings. It has opposed the use of phrases such as \\"Islamic guerrillas\\", \\"Islamic insurgency\\" and \\"Muslim militants\\" saying that terms like \\"militant\\" or \\"terrorist\\" should be used without a religious association \\"since no religion teaches or endorses terrorism, militancy or extremism. Although, the rise of major terrorist attacks by groups who claim they are waging a holy war on the west confuses this issue as the reasons behind their attacks comes from the base of their faith. and\\"Hess, Henry, \\"Media's portrayal of Islam criticized\\", Globe and Mail, September 24, 1998 The Congress has singled out the National Post as being \\"consistently is No. 1\\" as an anti-Islam media outlet.Petricevic, Mirko, \\"When religion's in the news; Faith groups often voice outrage about unfair media reports, so scholars are trying to determine if the complaints are valid\\", Kitchener- Waterloo Record, August 25, 2007 Response from the National Post A number of writers for the National Post have subsequently criticized the CIC over accusations that it is anti-Islam. Alexander Rose, wrote that \\"judging by its [CIC's] support for the [2001] Durban Conference, during which hook-nosed Jews were equated with apartheid and genocide, the CIC doesn't seem to have problems with some kinds of truly inflammatory racist language\\" and that the CIC's \\"fetish for censorship in the interest of \\"social harmony\\", as the CIC puts it, reeks of the very authoritarianism oppressing Muslims in Egypt, Iraq, Iran, and Saudi Arabia.\\" In addition, Rose stated that \\"By editing out bad language, it seems, the CIC believes that correct thoughts will result, even at the necessary expense of reporting the truth.\\" Robert Fulford wrote that the CIC \\"justifies its existence mainly by complaining about acts of prejudice that haven't happened\\" and that \\"it's ridiculous to suggest that we avoid the subject of religion when crimes are committed in the name of that religion by men and women considered part of it.\\" while Jonathan Kay wrote that \\"the folks at the Canadian Islamic Congress purport to be the arbiters of what can and can't be said in this country\\" and that CIC President Elmasry is \\"the country's self-appointed judge of all that is hateful.\\" =Statement and apology to Daniel Pipes= In the April 29, 2005 edition of the Friday Bulletin, CIC VP Wahida C. Valiante wrote that Daniel Pipes, a Conservative American political commentator, \\"is a follower of Hitler\\", \\"uses the tactics of Hitler\\" and \\"wants to ethnically cleanse America of its Muslim presence.\\" Pipes denied he ever made these statements and subsequently filed a notice of libel. The CIC subsequently apologized \\"without reservation\\" and \\"retract[ed the] remarks in the column.\\" The CIC also sent funds to cover Pipes' legal expenses and made a donation in his name to a Canadian charity. Pipes stated that the CIC's apology establishes that, in Canada, \\"Islamist groups do not have impunity to fabricate lies about their opponents.\\" =Human Rights complaint against Maclean's= In December 2007, the CIC launched complaints with the Canadian Human Rights Commission, British Columbia Human Rights Commission and the Ontario Human Rights Commission against Maclean's Magazine accusing the magazine of publishing 18 articles between January 2005 and July 2007 that they considered Islamophobic in nature including a column by Mark Steyn titled \\"The Future of Islam\\".Canadian Islamic Congress, \\"Human Rights Complaints Launched Against Maclean's Magazine\\", Canada NewsWire, December 4, 2007 According to the CIC complaint, Maclean's is \\"flagrantly Islamophobic\\" and \\"subjects Canadian Muslims to hatred and contempt.\\" In April, 2008 the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC) stated that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the complaint based on a gap in the legislation (the relevant portions of Ontario Human Rights Code only address discrimination via signs or symbols, not printed material). Despite not having jurisdiction, the Commission published a statement condemning the articles published by Maclean's as \\"xenophobic\\", \\"destructive\\", \\"Islamophobic\\" and \\"promoting prejudice\\". The Commission indicated that more discussion on the topic of Islamophobia in the media was warranted. Ontario Human Rights Public Statement The British Columbia Human Rights Commission heard the complaint in June 2008. The complaint was later dismissed. The Federal Human Rights Commission also dismissed the complaint. At the Niagara-on-the-Lake conference of the Canadian Association of Statutory Human Rights Agencies in June 2008, Wahida C. Valiante, national vice-president of the Canadian Islamic Congress, compared Mark Steyn to James Keegstra, an Alberta high school teacher who taught and tested his students on how Jews \\"created the Holocaust to gain sympathy. They basically talk about the same theories. This is not a civil dialogue.\\" She said that, in Germany, long before the Holocaust, \\"it was the words that set the stage for what happened later on.... We may end up with the same fate, and that is at the heart of why [the complainants] wanted to take this on.\\" =Opposition to extremism= The organization has warned Muslim parents to monitor the on-line habits of teenagers and discourage membership in foreign political organizations or preoccupation with religious rituals. It has also cautioned mosques to be on the alert against infiltration of the congregation by \\"foreign Muslim groups who may have hidden agendas.\\"Jiminez, Marina, \\"For Muslims, guilt by association\\", Globe and Mail, September 8, 2006. It has distributed a brochure warning that \\"some misguided Muslims may try to recruit Canadian Muslims, especially our young people, and use them to commit crimes against our country, or abroad\\" and urged the community to reject \\"extremist imported ideologies\\".Goodspeed, Peter, \\"Defenders of Islam: Far from being part of a homogenous culture, many Canadian Muslims are in a fierce battle to protect their religion from takeover by extremists\\", National Post, June 10, 2006 The CIC urged a moderate response to Danish cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad published in 2005. Anger at the depictions resulted in violent rallies and attacks on Danish institutions in Europe and the Muslim world. Elmasry urged Canadian Muslims to have a \\"controlled and calm\\" response consisting of writing letters to the editor and the Danish government. He also urged Muslims to engage in outreach by inviting non-Muslims into their homes and have open houses in mosques. He discouraged attendance at demonstrations saying that \\"[d]uring demonstrations, you don't have control of who will do what. Opposing sides who are anti-Muslim or supporters of freedom of expression could show up and a shouting match can turn violent. Instead, we've encouraged a more proactive approach to plead with the government to recognize anti-Islam the way it does anti-Semitism.\\"\\"Mohamed Elmasry; 'Many innocent people paid the price'\\", Toronto Star, February 12, 2006 =War in Afghanistan= The CIC called for Canada's military mission in Afghanistan to end in 2009 and for Canada to urge the United Nations to sponsor a peace conference involving all parties.Woods, Allan, \\"Manley's war panel flooded with proposals; Advisory group on Canada's role in Afghanistan extends its deadline for public comment by a week\\", Toronto Star, December 3, 2007 =Veiled voters= The CIC has opposed a proposed law by the federal Conservative government that would require all voters to show their faces before being allowed to cast ballots. The proposal is a response to Elections Canada issuing a directive to poll clerks to permit women wearing veils for religious reasons to vote. The CIC states that the proposed Tory law is unnecessary and will only promote discrimination against Muslims and provide \\"political mileage among Islamophobes.\\"Bryden, Joan, \\"New bill to ban veiled voters\\", Globe and Mail, October 27, 2007 =Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, 2001= In 2007, the CIC voiced its opposition to proposals to renew provisions of the 2001 Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act allowing investigative hearings and preventive arrests which had lapsed in early 2006. Speaking on behalf of the conference, Elmasry said \\"We object to any special courts that deal specifically with terror activities, because at the end of the day it will compromise the civil liberties of Canadians.\\"Foot, Richard & O'Neill, Juliet, \\"Two expired terrorism laws reintroduced; Legislation is tabled in senate Allows preventive arrests, secret hearings\\", Ottawa Citizen, October 24, 2007 =Sharia tribunals= The Canadian Islamic Congress supported recommendations by Marion Boyd that the government of Ontario permit sharia tribunals to which Muslims could voluntarily submit civil disputes and whose findings would then have legal weight under the Arbitration Act. The proposal was opposed by the Muslim Canadian Congress, the Canadian Council of Muslim Women and non-Muslim women's groups.Boase, Sharon, \\"Women's groups fight sharia in Ontario; Two reports submitted by a Muslim women's organization say introducing Islamic law into the province will harm the rights of vulnerable women\\", Hamilton Spectator, September 16, 2004Ogilvie, Megan, \\"Canadian Muslims give mixed reviews on moratorium; Debate urged on Islamic penal code Proposal would halt death penalty Proposal would halt stoning, death penalty Debate urged on Islamic penal code\\", Toronto Star, April 1, 2005. The provincial government ended up rejecting the proposal and scrapping existing religious arbitration tribunals for Jews and Christians in the process.\\"Ontario rejects sharia law: Jews, Christians to lose their religious tribunals as Premier vows 'one law for all'\\", National Post, September 12, 2005 The CIC raised controversy when CIC President Elmasry wrote that Canadian Muslims \\" [should] not to make a cause of publicly deriding their religion, badmouthing the Prophet, ridiculing the Qur'an and mounting uninformed crusades to smear their Islamic Law, the Shariah.\\" In the aftermath, the Muslim Canadian Congress demanded that the CIC apologize for \\"false\\" accusations that those who criticize sharia are \\"smearing Islam, ridiculing the Koran [and] badmouthing Muhammad.\\" The MCC stated that CIC President Elmasry accused the group of blasphemy, a crime that carries the death sentence in several Islamic countries, leading some MCC members to fear they will be arrested if they travel certain Islamic countries..\\" Arif Raza, MCC's lawyer wrote that \\"Your [Elmasry's] false and utterly irresponsible accusations of blasphemy have exposed these active, dynamic and prominent members of the Canadian Muslim community and their families to enormously dangerous consequences\\" and that \\"you [Elmasry] have defamed their good reputation and exposed them to ridicule and hatred within their own communities in Canada.\\" Elmasry responded by stating that Islam has no punishment for denouncing the religion, its holy book or the Prophet Mohammed, and he dismissed as \\"nonsense\\" the notion that his words could be construed as a death sentence. =Public funding of faith-based schools= The Congress expressed support for Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leader John Tory's proposal during the 2007 Ontario provincial election campaign to publicly fund faith-based schools arguing that rejecting the proposal would signify a retreat from multiculturalism.Travers, James, \\"Faith-based funding affects all of Canada\\", Toronto Star, October 1, 2007 The proposal, which was also supported by Jewish and some Christian groups, proved unpopular with the electorate and is cited as a key reason for the Conservative party's defeat in the election. =Support for Hezbollah and Hamas= During the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, the Canadian Islamic Congress and the Canadian Arab Federation urged the Canadian government to take Hezbollah and Hamas off its list of designated terrorist organizations. CIC president Elmasry wrote that the Canadian Government should \\"review its 2002 decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on its list of banned alleged terrorist organizations\\" because doing so \\"is an unconscionable act of hypocrisy and a mockery of justice\\" since Canada has not placed Israel on the same list. Elmasry also stated that the decision to place Hezbollah and Hamas on this list was \\"dictated by special interest groups with agendas that are contrary to peace with justice.\\" =Islamophobia= The CIC has been outspoken in its criticism of a perceived increase in Islamophobia since the September 11, 2001 attacks. It has accused governments and school boards of failing to address harassment and discrimination against Muslims and Arabs and has called for the province of Ontario to launch a public inquiry. At a press conference at Queen's Park, CIC official Wahida C. Valiante said that \\"Islamophobia does exist and it's growing.\\" and that \\"[s]ince 9/11, there has been no effort on behalf of the Ontario government, including the Ministry of Education, to have a comprehensive policy to address the growing isolation and marginalization of Muslim and Arab youth.\\"Marlow, Iain, \\"Address harassment, coalition urges\\", Toronto Star, July 6, 2007 =Claim that \\"Pro-Israeli Zionists\\" are \\"Playing Manipulative Mind-Games\\"= In 2006, CIC Vice-President Wahida C. Valiante criticized \\"pro-Israeli Zionists... promote fear of Islam and Muslims through propaganda, and by playing manipulative mind- games on unsuspecting, decent mainstream Canadian and Americans.\\" She also wrote that \\"the Zionist zealots (neo-conservative Likud Party supporters who yoke Israel's interests to those of America) and rightwing evangelical \\"millennial\\" or end-time Christians, both raise the spectre of \\"Islamic terrorism\\" as a force that threatens free people everywhere. They know that fear destroys reason, leaving the individual's conscience in the hands of those who instill the fear.\\" She also wrote that \\"Similarly, Fascism and Zionism achieved their objectives through fear.\\"The New Syndrome - F.e.a.r. -- Fear Everything Anxiety Reaction by Wahida C. Valiante, Canadian Islamic Congress Friday Magazine, Apr 28, 2006. Controversies =Controversies involving the Former CIC President, Dr. Mohamed Elmasry= Michael Coren Show On October 19, 2004 CIC President Elmasry appeared in a panel discussion on The Michael Coren Show to discuss the topic of \\"What is a terrorist?\\". During an exchange with the show's host, he stated that anyone in Israel over the age of 18 was a justifiable target of Palestinian attacks. He also criticized the recent bombing of hotels in Taba, Egypt on the grounds that some of the victims there were not Israelis. At first, Elmasry defended his remarks by insisting that he was merely sharing the standard Palestinian point of view. This led to further charges from his critics, who accused him of using the Palestinians as a scapegoat. In a letter to the Toronto Star, he denied having said what he was reported to have said. These remarks prompted harshly-worded responses from representatives of the Canadian Jewish Congress and several prominent Canadian Muslims. Elmasry later apologized for his remarks calling them his \\"biggest mistake\\" in 30 years of public life and offered his resignation which was not accepted by the CIC's board. The Elmasry affair led to criticisms that the media focussed entirely on the comments of the CIC president while neglecting controversial comments made on the same program by a B'nai B'rith official, Adam Aptowitzer who stated that \\"When Israel uses terror . . . to destroy a home and convince people . . . to be terrified of what the possible consequences are, I'd say that's an acceptable use to terrify somebody.\\" The remarks only received attention several weeks after the broadcast, and after Elmasry's apology and proffered resignation, when a press release by the Canadian Arab Federation highlighted them. Following the CAF press release, Aptowitzer retracted his comments and resigned his position with the B'nai B'rith. Toronto Star city editor John Ferri told the Toronto Star's ombud, Don Sellar, \\"we all had egg on our faces...[i]t was embarrassing for every paper in the city not to get the whole story from the outset.\\"Sellar, Don, \\"Arab group got the rest of the story\\", Toronto Star, November 6, 2004 In a letter to the Toronto Star following Sellar's column, Elmasary complained about the affair: > Canadian news media - including the Star - launched a relentless and unfair > attack against the Canadian Islamic Congress (CIC) and me while covering up > for weeks the outrageous statements made on the same show by Adam > Aptowitzer, then the Ontario chairman of the B'nai Brith Institute of > International Affairs.

Rachael Turkienicz, a professor of Jewish studies and education and an officer of Canadian Jewish Congress’ Ontario region, wrote, in a letter to Valiante, that she had \\"badly misinterpreted the concept of ‘the chosen people,’ which in fact refers to the relationship between Jews and God and that \\"It certainly does not connote ‘racial superiority,’\\" Turkienicz said.

Aerion initially partnered with Airbus on the project in September 2014. In December 2017, Airbus was replaced as a partner by Lockheed Martin. Its General Electric Affinity engine for the AS2 was unveiled in October 2018. In February 2019, Boeing replaced Lockheed Martin as a partner. The 12-passenger aircraft aims for Mach 1.4 with a supersonic natural laminar flow wing for a minimum projected range of 4,750 nm (8,800 km). A $4 billion development cost is anticipated, for a market for 300 over 10 years and 500 overall for $120 million each.

Born in Naples, he studied piano and composition in Italy before emigrating in 1903 to the United States as a university graduate. His career encompassed songwriting and movie music. He died in New York. Cardillo's richly scored and still popular 1911 romance Core 'ngrato (Ungrateful Heart) — also known by its lyric Catarì, Catarì, pecchè me dici sti parole amare — was written in America to a text in Neapolitan dialect by Alessandro Sisca; it is in fact the only famous Neapolitan song by an Italian- American immigrant. The song's first exponent was the operatic tenor Enrico Caruso, but it is not clear whether he commissioned it. Franco Corelli, Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo, José Carreras and, more recently, Roberto Alagna and Jonas Kaufmann are among the tenors to have included Core 'ngrato in their repertories. The composer also wrote the songs Barcarola, to a text by Edoardo San Giovanni, and Oi luna (O Silvery Moon), to a text by Riccardo Cordiferro.

It was an important and active U.S. Army installation from 1826 through 1946. It is the oldest operating U.S. military installation west of the Mississippi River, and it is now used as a base for the Army and Air National Guard. A Veterans Affairs healthcare system campus is located on the southern portion of the base and is also the headquarters for the Veterans Canteen Service.

Jefferson Barracks Hospital Wards in December 10, 1942. Army Air Forces Postcard from Jefferson Barracks during World War II. In 1826 General Edmund P. Gaines (Commander of the Western Department of the Army), Brig. General Henry Atkinson (commanding officer of the sixth infantry regiment), explorer William Clark, and Missouri Governor John Miller spent several days searching the banks of the Mississippi River for the perfect location for a new post to replace Fort Bellefontaine. A site near the city of \\"Vide Poche\\" or Carondelet, ten miles (16 km) south of St. Louis, was recommended and then approved by Major General Jacob J. Brown, Commanding General of the Army. On July 10, 1826, two days after the deed to the land was signed, the first military troops—six officers and 245 enlisted men of Companies A, B, H and I of the 1st Infantry Regiment, commanded by Brevet Major Stephen Watts Kearny—arrived at the new post and started building temporary quarters that they named Cantonment Miller in honor of Governor Miller. In 1827 the military post was formally named Jefferson Barracks in honor of Thomas Jefferson who had died the year before. Even William Clark's son, Meriwether Lewis Clark, Sr., would join the ranks of Jefferson Barracks. It was also designated the first \\"Infantry School of Practice.\\" The first conflict that the men of Jefferson Barracks were involved with was the Black Hawk War in 1832. Troops were deployed from Jefferson Barracks to push \\"hostile Indians\\" back into their village in present-day Iowa. Chief Black Hawk was captured and brought back to Jefferson Barracks. In 1832, the United States Regiment of Dragoons were formed and stationed at Jefferson Baracks. The dragoons, trained to fight mounted or dismounted, were the first unit of permanent cavalry in the United States Army and were later called the 1st U.S. Dragoons. Mexican–American War Jefferson Barracks became a major military post during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) when it served as a rest and supply station for most U.S. troops deploying to Mexico. Jefferson Barracks was the recruiting center for outfitting and training most of the regiments organized for the Mexican War in 1846, and upon the return of the triumphant U.S. forces in 1848, many were deployed to Jefferson Barracks due to its strategic location and healthful situation. In 1853, newly elected President Franklin Pierce, who had served as a brigadier general during the Mexican War, appointed Jefferson Davis as his Secretary of War. At Jefferson Barracks, in 1855, Davis soon organized the First and Second Regiments of Cavalry, known derisively as \\"Jeff Davis's Pets,\\" because the commissioned personnel assigned to them were the best in the Army. Albert Sidney Johnston served as colonel and Robert E. Lee as lieutenant colonel of the Second Regiment of Cavalry. A list of the officers of the Second Regiment of Cavalry includes some of the ablest commanders of the U.S. Civil War. The Second Regiment of Cavalry was redesignated as the Fifth Regiment of Cavalry in 1861. The 2d U.S. Dragoons were redesignated as the 2d Regiment of Cavalry in 1861 when the War Department discontinued the use of Dragoons as a unit designation.http://www.history.army.mil/books/R&H;/R&H-5CV.htm; Civil War During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Jefferson Barracks served as a military hospital for both sides and a recruitment depot for the North. In 1862 construction of the Western Sanitary Commission's hospital facilities began at Jefferson Barracks. By the time that the hospital complex was complete, it could hold 3,000 patients. By the end of the first year of the war, over 5,000 sick and wounded had been admitted and, by the end of the war, well over 18,000 soldiers had been treated at Jefferson Barracks Hospital. In 2002, The Missouri Civil War Museum was founded, which is still being restored today. The MCWM is being brought to life in the old 1905 Post Exchange Building. Spanish–American War With the declaration of the Spanish–American War in 1898, many regular army and volunteer regiments were, once again, formed and outfitted at Jefferson Barracks. Jefferson Barracks was permanently designated as a recruiting depot in 1906; it had been used intermittently as such through generations. World War I On March 1, 1912 Jefferson Barracks became the main base for the first experiments in aviation parachuting. Albert Berry became the first person to successfully parachute from an airplane, which was being flown by Anthony Jannus over the field. During World War I, Jefferson Barracks served as a training and recruitment station for soldiers heading to Europe. Jefferson Barracks was included in the Sixth Corps Area from 1920–1940. During the 1930s, the Citizens Military Training Camp or CMTC was held at Jefferson Barracks. Young men could spend one month a year at the post being trained as a soldier, and after three years they could enter the military. Also during that time the Works Progress Administration (WPA) had camps at Jefferson Barracks. World War II During World War II, Jefferson Barracks was a major reception center for U.S. troops being drafted into the military. It also served as an important basic training site for the Army, then later was the first Army Air Corps Training Site. Elements of the Central (later Eastern) Technical Training Command were stationed at the barracks. During World War II, Jefferson Barracks had a peak area of 1,518 acres (6.14 km²), and had billeting space for 16 officers and 1,500 enlisted persons. Jefferson Barracks was decommissioned as a military post in 1946 with the end of World War II. Post-World War II After Jefferson Barracks was decommissioned, portions of the grounds were sold off for construction of houses. Some of the barracks were acquired by the St. Louis County Housing Authority as temporary low-cost housing. Those were demolished in the 1960s and replaced by the current Jefferson Townhomes development. Bishop DuBourg High School was located on the Jefferson Barracks property for several years in the early 1950s. The former Jefferson Barracks School is now used for storage and maintenance; and the former theater is St. Bernadette Catholic Church. It is now the site of two St. Louis County Parks (Jefferson Barracks County Park and Sylvan Springs County Park), a National Guard Base (Army and Air), the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery and the Department of Veterans Affairs St. Louis Health Care System - Jefferson Barracks Division. Part of the hospital grounds were donated to the Mehlville School District in the 1960s to build Charles S. Beasley Elementary School. Today, the 135-acre National Guard post at Jefferson Barracks is home to the 70th Troop Command, the Missouri Army National Guard's largest brigade. The post is also headquarters for the Region 7 Homeland Response Force; the Missouri Air National Guard's 157th Air Operations Group and the 10th Psychological Operations Battalion of the U.S. Army Reserve. During the 1960s and 1970s, portions of Jefferson Barracks County Park were used as a landfill. During the 1980s, an annual balloon race was held in the park. Today, because of its large size, high school cross country races are often held in the park in the fall months, most notably the Hancock Invitational. Museums =Jefferson Barracks Museums= Jefferson Barracks County Park includes the several museums, museums that house artifacts and history of Jefferson Barracks while it was an active United States Military Post. The Powder Magazine Museum focuses on the history of Jefferson Barracks from its inception in 1826 until its closure in 1946.

He was a strong advocate of New Orleans jazz as played by veteran African-American musicians. In the 1960s, he led his own group, the Easy Riders Jazz Band, formed his own label, Jazz Crusade, and organized northern tours for Kid Thomas Valentine, George Lewis, and Jim Robinson. He produced over 100 recorded jazz sessions for Jazz Crusade and appeared as trombonist or drummer on over 50 recording sessions of New Orleans jazz. The Easy Riders Jazz Band was one of the most acclaimed revival bands of the 1960s. Bissonnette brought Sammy Rimington to the United States. During his career, he worked with Alvin Alcorn, Red Allen, Jimmy Archey, Polo Barnes, Albert Burbank, Alex Bigard, Don Ewell, Pops Foster, George Guesnon, Edmond Hall, Bob Helm, Tuba Fats Lacen, George Lewis, Fred Lonzo, Alcide Pavageau, George Probert, Kid Sheik, Zutty Singleton, Victoria Spivey, Gregg Stafford, Michael White, and Kid Thomas Valentine. Bissonnette came in first place as \\"New Young Artist\\" in the 1965 Jazzology Jazz Poll. Over 30 years later he placed No. 5 among all jazz trombonists in the same poll. After a period out of music, he published his memoir, The Jazz Crusade, in 1992, reactivated his label, and began to play again. He spent much of the 1990s documenting the British jazz scene with his \\"Best of the Brits\\" album series. He retired in 2006 and died a dozen years later, in June 2018 at the age of 81.

Biography Lucrezia Bori was born on December 24, 1887, in Valencia, Spain. Her real name was Lucrecia Borja y González de Riancho. Her father was an officer in the Spanish army. Her family were descended from the influential family of the Italian Renaissance, the House of Borgia and she herself was named after her ancestor, Lucrezia Borgia. Her voice had a unique timbre and transparent quality unlike any present-day singer. She studied in Milan with Vidal and made her debut at the Teatro Adriano in Rome as Micaëla in Bizet's Carmen on October 31, 1908. In December 1910, she made her debut at La Scala as Carolina in Cimarosa's Il matrimonio segreto; the following year, she sang Octavian in the Italian premiere of Der Rosenkavalier there. Her career at the Metropolitan Opera began in the summer of 1910 during the Met's first visit to Paris. On June 9 of that year she replaced a singer who had become ill in the role of Manon in Puccini's Manon Lescaut. On the opening night of the 1912/13 season, she made her debut with the Met in New York when she sang Manon opposite Enrico Caruso. In 1915 she was forced to stop singing for a surgical operation to remove nodes on her vocal cords. Following a lengthy convalescence, she returned to the stage in 1921. During the course of her career with the opera, she appeared a total of 629 times and sang the leading role in 39 operas. In 1930 Bori appeared on the cover of Time. She was famous for her portrayals of Manon in Massenet's opera; Mimì in La bohème; Fiora in L'amore dei tre re; Mélisande in Pelléas et Mélisande; and Violetta in La traviata. Beginning late in 1932, Bori began a career as fundraiser. When the Great Depression struck, the Met continued to sell tickets to performances with no difficulty, but the contributions of its stockholders fell off dramatically and by the end of 1932 the board of directors found that a great deal of money would be needed if the next season were to be held. Early in 1933, Bori agreed to work with the Met's managers to obtain the funds. In this work she was not just a figurehead. She headed an organization called the Committee to Save the Metropolitan Opera House and, in actions that were widely reported in the press, she made appeals by flyer, letter, and in personal contacts with potential benefactors. After a personal appeal from her during a radio broadcast of Wagner's Tristan und Isolde on 11 March 1933, she sent personal acknowledgements to the thousands of people who responded.She also traveled widely and participated in numerous benefits, at which she performed. During this period of fundraising, she continued to carry out an arduous schedule of performance. It took only two months to raise the $300,000 that was needed. In May 1933, the chairman of the Metropolitan board publicly thanked Bori, saying she had accomplished a feat that was thought to be impossible. He said she \\"took command of the situation and applied to the fulfillment of the purpose in hand the same qualities of imagination and genius which have, in her own work made her one of the greatest artists of all time.\\" From 1933 to 1935 Bori served as chair of the \\"Maintain the Metropolitan\\" committee which had succeeded the \\"Save the Metropolitan\\" committee. To assure the viability of the 1934/35 opera season, this committee raised an amount approximately equal to the sum raised the previous year. In 1935, she was the first performer to be elected to the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Opera Association. In joining the board she continued to sit on its opera management committee. Her farewell gala on March 29, 1936, was one of the great events at the Metropolitan. Bori sang scenes from Manon and La traviata, with contributions from Flagstad, Melchior, Rethberg, Pinza, Ponselle, Martinelli, Tibbett and Richard Crooks. Bori continued to perform in recitals and record for some years after her Metropolitan retirement; she can be heard, for example, in \\"off-the-air\\" recordings of a Hollywood Bowl concert from 1937, singing \\"Si, mi chiamano Mimì\\" and \\"O soave fanciulla\\" with tenor Joseph Bentonelli, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under Otto Klemperer. After her retirement from singing she was named chairman of the Metropolitan Opera Guild. Under her leadership the Guild collected musical instruments for military hospitals and performed other war activities as well as boosting opera throughout the country. Bori suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on May 2, 1960, and she died in Roosevelt Hospital on May 14. She had never married, believing that artists should not do so.

It can be extremely painful for an injury of its size, although otherwise it is not a serious medical condition. Nature A laceration of the nail bed causes bleeding into the constricted area underneath the hard nail plate. The blood pools under the nail, giving a reddish, brownish, blueish, or grey/blackish discoloration. The blood puts pressure on the nail. Throbbing pain is common. Subungual hematomas typically heal without incident, though infection may occur. The pressure of the blood blister may cause separation of nail plate from the nail bed (onycholysis), but the nail should not be pulled off, as this can cause scarring of the nailbed and deformed nails. Nail discolouration may last some months. The nail plate may also become thicker and more brittle as a result of the injury (onychochauxis). The deformed nail plate will gradually grow out and be replaced by new, normal-appearing nail plate in several months' time. Infrequently, the nail may become painful and require surgical drainage. Causes ease for foot to extend. Left: Proper fit A foot which has lost a toenail, due to running injuries exacerbated by poorly-fitting shoes, badly- cut nails, and mild Morton's toe The condition is caused by a traumatic injury, such as slamming a finger in a door, or from sports activities, especially those involving sudden accelerations, such as soccer, basketball, and tennis, or going downhill, such as running or hiking rugged terrain, and ill-fitting footwear. Repeatedly thrusting the toes against a shoe's toe box can cause a subungual hematoma called jogger's toe runner's toe, or black toenail. In a marathon, several percent of runners may be affected. Wearing footwear which fits helps prevent runner's toe. If the shoe is too loose on the midfoot, the foot can slide forwards in the shoe, especially when going downhill. This may jam the toes into the end of the toebox. If the foot is sliding forwards because the shoe is too loose around the midfoot, it may be restrained by lacing the shoe carefully, or placing bulky padding between the tongue and the lacing, or by wrapping a strap in a figure-eight around the foot and ankle (image). Excessively tight or uneven fit around the midfoot may, however, cause tendon problems. Separately, if there is not enough space around the toes, the toes will also hit the toebox repeatedly. Feet become longer and wider when weight is put on them, because the arches flatten, and the toes also splay and bend. (this is the publication of a four-year review into the footwear of the US military by the Army Shoe Board, of which the author, a physician and senior officer of the United States Army Medical Corps, is president. At the end of a long journey on foot, the arches flatten, the metatarsals spread, and the foot swells more than after a short one. The toes also need vertical space; a toe cap which is low enough to press on the top of the toe may also cause bruising under the nail, especially if the toe cap is stiff. If the toebox is pointed, the toes may be wedged forwards into the area with inadequate height. Nails which protrude unevenly may concentrate force on the toenail; properly-cut nails are therefore also important. Some susceptible runners may also have Morton's toe. In this variant of human foot anatomy, the second toe extends further out than the great toe. This can make it harder to find shoes with adequate space around the toes. Treatment Subungual hematomas can resolve on their own, without treatment being necessary. If they are acutely painful, they may be drained. Subungual hematomas are treated by either releasing the pressure conservatively, by drilling a hole through the nail into the hematoma (trephining) within 48 hours of injury, or by removing the entire nail. Trephining is generally accomplished by using a heated instrument to pass through the nail into the blood clot. Removal of the nail is typically done when the nail itself is disrupted, a large laceration requiring suturing is suspected, or a fracture of the tip of the finger occurs. Although general anesthesia is generally not required, a digital nerve block is recommended if the nail is to be removed. For trephination, the block is often more painful than the procedure.

Building  =First theatre – 1818 to 1823= The first theatre was commissioned in 1810 by King Maximilian I of Bavaria because the nearby Cuvilliés Theatre had too little space. It was designed by Karl von Fischer, with the 1782 Odéon in Paris as architectural precedent. Construction began on 26 October 1811 but was interrupted in 1813 by financing problems. In 1817 a fire occurred in the unfinished building. The new theatre finally opened on 12 October 1818 with a performance of Die Weihe by Ferdinand Fränzl, but was soon destroyed by another fire on 14 January 1823; the stage décor caught fire during a performance of Die beyden Füchse by Étienne Méhul and the fire could not be put out because the water supply was frozen. Coincidentally the Paris Odéon itself burnt down in 1818. =Second theatre – 1825 to 1943= Designed by Leo von Klenze, the second theatre incorporated Neo-Grec features in its portico and triangular pediment and an entrance supported by Corinthian columns. In 1925 it was modified to create an enlarged stage area with updated equipment. The building was gutted in an air raid on the night of 3 October 1943. =Third theatre – 1963 to present= The third and present theatre (1963) recreates Karl von Fischer's original neo-classical design, though on a slightly larger, 2,100-seat scale. The magnificent royal box is the centre of the interior rondel, decorated with two large caryatids. The new stage covers , and is thus the world's third largest, after the Opéra Bastille in Paris and the Grand Theatre, Warsaw. Through the consistent use of wood as a building material, the auditorium has excellent acoustics. Architect Gerhard Moritz Graubner closely preserved the original look of the foyer and main staircase. It opened on 21 November 1963 with an invitation-only performance of Die Frau ohne Schatten under the baton of Joseph Keilberth. Two nights later came the first public performance, of Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, again under Keilberth. Interior of the National Theatre  Music  During its early years, the National Theatre saw the premières of a significant number of operas, including many by German composers. These included Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde (1865), Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (1868), Das Rheingold (1869) and Die Walküre (1870), after which Wagner chose to build the Festspielhaus in Bayreuth and held further premières of his works there. During the latter part of the 19th century, it was Richard Strauss who would make his mark on the theatre in the city in which he was born in 1864. After accepting the position of conductor for a short time, Strauss returned to the theatre to become principal conductor from 1894 to 1898. In the pre-War period, his Friedenstag (1938) and Capriccio were premièred in Munich. In the post-War period, the house has seen significant productions and many world premieres. = World premieres = :The list refers only to those premières of the Bavarian State Opera staged in the National Theatre. The Bavarian State Opera had additional premieres also in other theatres. The Bayerisches Staatsballett had also premieres in the National Theatre. * 7 October 1849, Benvenuto Cellini by Franz Lachner, Henri Auguste Barbier and Léon de Wailly * 10 June 1865, Tristan and Isolde by Richard Wagner * 21 June 1868, Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg by Richard Wagner * 22 September 1869, Das Rheingold by Richard Wagner * 26 June 1870, Die Walküre by Richard Wagner * 29 June 1888, Die Feen by Richard Wagner * 23 January 1897, Königskinder (Melodrama edition) by Engelbert Humperdinck and Elsa Bernstein * 10 October 1897, Sarema by Alexander von Zemlinsky, Adolf von Zemlinszky and Arnold Schönberg * 22 January 1899, Der Bärenhäuter by Siegfried Wagner * 19 March 1906, I quatro rusteghi (Die vier Grobiane) by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and Giuseppe Pizzolato (German by Hermann Teibler) * 11 December 1906, Das Christ- Elflein by Hans Pfitzner and Ilse von Stach * 4 December 1909, Il segreto di Susanna (Susannens Geheimnis) by Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari and Enrico Golisciani (German by Max Kalbeck) * 28 March 1916, Der Ring des Polykrates by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Leo Feld and Julius Korngold and Violanta by Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Hans Müller-Einigen * 30 November 1920, Die Vögel by Walter Braunfels (freely adapted from Aristophanes) * 15 November 1924, Don Gil von den grünen Hosen by Walter Braunfels (after Tirso de Molina) * 12 November 1931, Das Herz by Hans Pfitzner and Hans Mahner-Mons * 24 July 1938, Friedenstag by Richard Strauss, Joseph Gregor and Stefan Zweig * 5 February 1939, Der Mond by Carl Orff * 28 October 1942, Capriccio by Richard Strauss and Clemens Krauss * 27 November 1963, Die Verlobung in San Domingo by Werner Egk (after Heinrich von Kleist) * 1 August 1972, Sim Tjong by Yun I-sang and Harald Kunz * 9 July 1978, Lear by Aribert Reimann and Claus H.

This novel traces the shifting relations among three people and a magnificent collection of art, decorative arts, and furniture arrayed like jewels in a country house called Poynton. Mrs. Gereth, a widow of impeccable taste and iron will, formed the collection over decades only to have it torn away from her when her son Owen decides to marry a frivolous woman. The story is largely told from the viewpoint of Fleda Vetch, a keenly intelligent young woman of straitened circumstances who, shortly after becoming the intimate friend and companion of Mrs. Gereth, falls in love with Owen. Sympathetic to Mrs. Gereth's anguish over losing the fine things she patiently collected, Fleda shuttles between the estranged mother and son, becoming ever more involved in their affairs. Plot summary Widow Adela Gereth tells the sensitive and tasteful Fleda Vetch that she's afraid her son Owen (heir to the family home Poynton) will marry the coarse Mona Brigstock. Mrs Gereth dreads the prospect of her painstakingly collected furniture and other art objects being given up to a philistine wife, while being left to live alone in Ricks, a small and coarsely designed cottage bequeathed to her. Owen in turn enlists Fleda to get his mother to leave with a minimum of fuss. Fleda is shocked to find that Mrs Gereth has decorated Ricks with many of the best pieces from Poynton. Owen reports that Mona is angry with the 'theft' of the valuable heirlooms, and consequently becomes colder towards him. Meanwhile, he begins to show an attraction to Fleda and eventually declares his love for her. Fleda insists that he honour his engagement to Mona unless she breaks it off. Mrs Gereth returns the fine furniture to Poynton on the assumption that Fleda has secured Owen for herself. After a few days Owen and Mona are reported to be married, and they go abroad. Fleda gets a letter from Owen asking her to select any one piece from Poynton as hers to keep, and she goes to Poynton some days later only to find it has been consumed by fire. Main themes This tightly constructed novel treats several themes common throughout James' work. Fleda Vetch is one of James' typically sensitive central characters, very scrupulous and thus sometimes victimized by the more decisive if less fastidious people around her. Mrs. Gereth is a memorable example of James' unprincipled dominators, who try to bulldoze their way over other people. Disregarding Fleda's scruples, she attempts to force a marriage between Owen and Fleda because she believes it will give her a better chance to retain the \\"spoils\\" she so lovingly collected. Mrs. Gereth also shows the acquisitive collector's mania that James often, though not always, saw as an insidious form of corruption. Owen is a brainless youth of no great harm, though he's easily and obviously confused. James plays Mona mostly for laughs as a bumptious barbarian, though she can turn nasty over acquiring what is due to her. Literary significance and criticism Although The Spoils of Poynton is rarely considered one of James' greatest works, most critics have enjoyed the entertaining and well-paced conflict in the novel. The poetic justice of the book's conclusion has also been widely accepted as the best way to finish the struggle. James' portrayal of Mrs. Gereth has received particular acclaim. She sometimes seems almost unbalanced in her passionate devotion to her fine furniture and art objects: \\"There isn’t one of them I don’t know and love-- yes, as one remembers and cherishes the happiest moments of one’s life. Blindfold, in the dark, with the brush of a finger, I could tell one from another. They’re living things to me; they know me, they return the touch of my hand.\\" Fleda Vetch has earned most critics' sympathy for steering the right course through an almost impossible situation. And there are the usual touches of understated but much-appreciated humor, as when Mrs. Gereth throws one of the Brigstocks' tacky magazines out the door at Mona, and the coarse but athletic girl deftly snares it on the fly. \\"Good catch!\\" is Owen's reaction. However, some critics, among them William Veeder, argue that Owen ultimately makes a stronger choice in Mona, because Fleda is too manipulative and mentally unsound a character. Adaptations In 1970, the BBC produced a highly regarded 4-part television program based on the book, starring Gemma Jones and Ian Ogilvy. This was broadcast in the U.S. by PBS in 1971 as part of the first season of Masterpiece Theatre. Cultural references In the 2004 Booker Prize–winning novel The Line of Beauty, written by Alan Hollinghurst, two of the main characters attempt to get financing for a film production of the story; this plot point is also included in the 2006 three-part BBC Two serial of the same name, adapted for television by Andrew Davies. In the novel In a Summer Season by Elizabeth Taylor (novelist), the character of Kate Heron fondly recalls reading The Spoils of Poynton with her late husband and friends Charles and Dorothea. They called Lady Asperley, a mutual friend, The Spoils of Poynton because her obsession with objects reminded them of Mrs. Gereth. In the novel Mystery by Peter Straub, the character of teacher Dennis Handley describes “...his greatest bookfinding coup, the discovery of a typed manuscript of “The Spoils of Poynton””. Handley describes how James dictated the novel, in part, to typist William McAlpine, and how he, Handley, couldn’t prove this was THE original manuscript, but he didn’t need to do so; he knew what he had. His telling of this story is spoiled when his audience, student Tom Pasmore, appears to not listen, instead steering the conversation to discussion of a local murder.

When Worlds of Wonder declared bankruptcy in 1988 the line was severely hurt by the crisis and ultimately cancelled. Demise With the strength of its line of toys, Worlds of Wonder’s fortunes rose well beyond its assets. This culminated in a rather spectacular tumble as stock trades by company officers spooked investors. The company also received much negative press after the death of Leonard Falcon, who was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy after the deputy mistook the Lazer Tag toy he was using for a real gun. Attempting to stem the tide, WoW issued Non-Investment Grade Bonds, commonly known as junk bonds, in an effort to buoy itself. Although there is some contention as to whether this strategy would have helped, the attempt was made moot by the 1987 stock market crash. Worlds of Wonder filed for bankruptcy protection and was liquidated in 1988NY Times article about the bankruptcy petition and went through a series of layoffs. The creditors continued to operate the company in receivership until finally closing its doors in late 1990.

Despite being filmed in Canada, the series was broadcast first in the United States. It first aired on August 17, 1998, and ran for one season, ending on November 9, 1998. As this was part of a crop of new shows produced in 1998 by Sci Fi Channel and it was not successful beyond the first season, it was never placed in syndication. Betaville was the original title for the series. The series is an anthology hybrid. The stories all took place in the fictional future city of \\"Betaville\\", a nod to Jean-Luc Godard's Alphaville. However, the majority of the stories were adapted from short stories that originally didn't have anything to do with the fictional city. The stories were adapted from older works by famous science fiction authors which explored the impact of certain technologies on the human body and psyche, and the theme of humanity being overwhelmed by hostile technologies. Each episode had a host—originally to be named \\"Paradox\\" until the concept was dropped—that served as a narrator, adding a prologue and epilogue to the show as with The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits. The Volkswagen New Beetle was chosen to be the transportation of Betaville. Any time it was called for a car to be featured in an episode, a New Beetle was used. Setting Betaville is the setting for all the stories of Welcome to Paradox. Set in an unspecified time in the future, Betaville is a city of Utopian ideals. There is no crime, violence, disease, or any other problems of modern society. However, there is a dark undercurrent in Betaville that impacts some citizens directly. Technology has invaded daily life to the point that simulated reality is preferred to actual reality, perfect machines are wresting control from their wealthy and pampered owners, and humanity is challenged by genetic engineering and social engineering programs that push the limits of arrogance and sanity.

In the book, Dear explained that he feels the incident was misrepresented by the news media. Summary Egbert was a 16-year-old child prodigy who was battling intense academic pressure, drug addiction, and personal issues. He had entered the school's utility tunnels with the intent of committing suicide and went into hiding after that attempt. After learning that Egbert had played Dungeons & Dragons, Dear, who was unfamiliar with the game, suggested that Egbert may have entered the tunnels to play a live-action version of the game. This theory was taken as fact by the media and caused intense controversy over the psychological effects of role playing games. After several weeks, Egbert gave himself up to Dear. In 1980, less than a year after the incident, Egbert committed suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wound. Dear kept the true circumstances of the disappearance a secret until four years after Egbert's death, due to a promise he made to the boy not to reveal them.

Webb was the brother of Alex Webb, the nephew of actress Sylvia Syms, and appeared as a child in The Punch and Judy Man, British comedian Tony Hancock's second starring film, in which Syms played the wife of his character. Career Nick Webb was born in Manchester, Lancashire and educated at Berkhamsted School, Ashlyns School Berkhamsted, LAMDA, and Leeds College of Music. Captivated by the folk musicians of the 1960s, particularly John Martyn, he began playing and performing as a teenager and ran The Portcullis Club in Berkhamsted. At the beginning of the 1980s, Webb met classical and flamenco guitarist Simon James and founded Acoustic Alchemy as a duo, recording a self-financed, self-produced album in 1981. James left the partnership to study flamenco guitar in Spain, leaving Webb to promote the record. He turned to rock guitarist Greg Carmichael, whose background complemented his own. Webb had studied jazz at Leeds while Carmichael had studied classical music at London College of Music. The duo worked for Virgin Airlines, recording in-flight music for trans-Atlantic flights, then signed to MCA, which released their 1987 debut album Red Dust & Spanish Lace. The album included assistance from percussionist Mario Aragandoña and drummer Bart Smaak and was the first of many to be produced by German audio engineer Klaus Genuit at Hansa Haus Studios in Bonn. After Natural Elements in 1988 and Blue Chip in 1989, Acoustic Alchemy signed with GRP, which released Reference Point in 1990. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award. GRP released Back on the Case (1991), The New Edge (1993), Against the Grain (1994) and Arcanum (1996). During the 1990s the band toured the United States. Positive Thinking (1998) was Acoustic Alchemy's last album with Webb. Due to pancreatic cancer, he was unable to perform on the album, but he wrote for it and supervised the recording. He died in February 1998, and the album was released later that year.

He has been described by fellow author Jessica Amanda Salmonson, who interviewed him during 1978, as \\"the ultimate gentleman\\" and \\"a gentle, calm, warm, and good friend.\\" He was known for his intricate plotting and the careful research that he did for his stories, a habit he traced back to two mistakes made when he wrote his early story \\"The City of Spiders\\". A resurgence of interest in his work occurred during the 1970s due to its appearance in the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series and the successor fantasy series published with the imprint of Del Rey Books. In addition to writing, Munn collected books and classic pulp magazines, including Air Wonder Stories, Amazing Stories, Astounding and other science fiction titles, along with Argosy, Argosy All Story, Cavalier, Weird Tales (to the end of the Wright publication series), and others. Also in his library were self-manufactured books consisting of serialized stories extracted from magazines, notably works by George Allan England such as \\"Darkness and Dawn\\". About three fourths of his collection was ruined by exposure to weather during a relocation and had to be destroyed. During his last years Munn lived in Tacoma, Washington in a house he had built himself. He did his writing either in his living room or in the attic room that constituted his library. During this time he was working on an additional volume of the Merlin series to be called The Sword of Merlin, which he did not live to finish. He was befriended at this time by the young writer W. H. Pugmire, who was influenced by Munn's work. Early career Munn's \\"The Werewolf's Daughter\\" was the cover story in the October 1928 Weird Tales Munn was a major early contributor to the pulp magazine Weird Tales during the 1920s and 1930s, with the editorship of Farnsworth Wright. Munn's first, \\"The Werewolf of Ponkert\\" (1925 WT) arose from a comment by H.P. Lovecraft suggesting a story written from the werewolf's point of view. Munn's resulting tales became the first of a series, \\"The Tales of the Master\\". The series included a serial, \\"The Werewolf's Daughter\\" (1928 WT) and this and the initial story appeared as The Werewolf of Ponkert (1958). Munn later continued the Werewolf Clan stories; these dealt with the descendants of the werewolf in the first story. The plots of the Werewolf Clan tales revolved between the struggle between the titular family and \\"The Master\\", a supernatural villain that Munn based on Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer. When the change of editors of the magazine from Farnsworth Wright to Dorothy McIlwraith; McIlwraith used different writers, Munn's major market was eliminated. Munn later reworked the other stories and added extensively to the series, most of these tales appearing initially in Robert Weinberg's \\"Lost Fantasies\\" series, and then in book form as Tales of the Werewolf Clan #1: In the Tomb of the Bishop (1979) and Tales of the Werewolf Clan #2: The Master Goes Home (1979).John Clute and John Grant, eds. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy. London: Orbit, 1997, p. 669 The two series of works for which he is known best, his Merlin saga and the Tales of the Werewolf Clan, were both started during the Weird Tales period. King of the World’s Edge, the first Merlin novel, was written as early as 1925. On publication (Weird Tales, 1936) it was compared favorably to the stories of Robert E. Howard, of whose fiction Munn confessed to being a great admirer. The novel starts in the last days of King Arthur, and follows the adventures of Myrdhinn (Merlin) and a Roman centurion, who leave Britain for new lands to the West, and find themselves in the kingdom of the Aztecs. Later career After Weird Tales ceased publishing his work, Munn generally did not seek new outlets. he devoted to his time to family duties for many years and worked in various trades from sawmill operator to ice cream salesman. It was not until he lost a knee cap in one of these jobs that Munn returned to full-time writing around 1965. With the exception of the 1980 epic historical novel, The Lost Legion) his post-Weird Tales output was minor, most of it either self-published in small press editions or issued haphazardly by publishers who sought him. While he had already completed The Ship from Atlantis, the second installment of the Merlin Saga, in 1941, it was only published 26 years later, when Donald A. Wollheim contracted to publish King of the World's Edge in book form and also accepted the sequel. The Ship from Atlantis follows the further adventures of Gwalchmai, who sets out for Rome but becomes lost in the Sargasso Sea and encounters a survivor from Atlantis. These two novels, later combined under the title Merlin's Godson (omnibus 1976), are a precursor to Munn's magnum opus, Merlin's Ring (1974). The publication of his last great work of fantasy, Merlin's Ring (third of the series), was also the result of a publisher seeking him. Reprising Wollheim’s role, Lin Carter, editor of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, learned of it while enquiring about the availability of the first two Merlin books. In the event, it was issued by Ballantine Books soon after the end of Carter’s connection with the publisher, in the interregnum between the Adult Fantasy series and Ballantine’s new Del Rey Books fantasy series. Merlin's Ring explores the Atlantean and Arthurian influences down through history to the time of Joan of Arc. Del Rey later completed Carter’s original intention by reissuing both of the first two books in a single volume with the title of Merlin's Godson. Munn was fascinated by Joan of Arc and wrote an extensive narrative poem about her, The Banner of Joan (1975). Although essentially nonfantastic - other than in Joan's spirit-driven zeal - the poem may be seen as an epilogue to the Merlin sequence. Robert E. Weinberg was responsible for the revival and completion of the Werewolf Clan stories when he expressed an interest in reprinting them in his periodical Lost Fantasies. Munn had originally written eight werewolf stories for Weird Tales before its change of editorship; he now wrote two more to fill gaps in the sequence, and the entire series appeared in three parts in Lost Fantasies, nos. 4-6, 1976–77, as \\"Ten Tales of the Werewolf Clan.\\" Afterward Munn wrote and self-published three additional stories to finish the series. The complete series was issued by Donald M. Grant, Publisher, Inc. as Tales of the Werewolf Clan, Volumes 1-2 (1979–80). Some of Munn’s late horror stories were published in such anthology series as Daw Books’ The Year's Best Horror Stories. After his retirement he produced a number of stories for small-press magazine, especially Weirdbook. He developed a new sequence that sought to link Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos stories with an Arthur Machen-esque ancient race of Pictish fairies. The published tales are \\"The Merlin Stone\\" (1977), \\"The Stairway to the Sea\\", and \\"The Wandered of the Waters\\", all in Weirdbook. Every birthday and Christmas from 1974 to 1980, Munn issued a booklet as gift for friends. These were usually poetry, but several were short fantasies. The Lost Legion is Munn's only other published novel. It is a sister to King of the World's Edge but set 400 years earlier at the time of Caligula. H. Warner Munn was a Founding Syndic [with John Charles Moran, Don Herron, and Donald Sidney-Fryer] of The F. Marion Crawford Memorial Society [Nashville] in 1975. He contributed to the first three numbers of its annual review The Romantist (1977-1979), and also to Number 4-5 (1980-1981) that was an In Memoriam tribute to him. Recognition =Award nominations= Merlin’s Ring was nominated for the 1975 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award and World Fantasy Award for Best Novel. He was also nominated for the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement during 1977, 1979, and 1980, and the Balrog Award for Professional Achievement during 1981. His poetry collection The Book of Munn was nominated for the 1980 Balrog Award for the categories of Collection/Anthology and Professional Publication, and his last novel, The Lost Legion, was also nominated for the 1981 Balrog Award for Novel. =Awards received= He was guest of honor of the 1978 World Fantasy Convention, and won the Balrog Award for Poet during both 1980 and 1981. He also won the Clark Ashton Smith Award for Poetry, with which he is pictured on the inside of The Book of Munn.

The game's plot involves Nobby trying to get to Antopia, a place where there are ants everywhere, so Nobby can eat his belly full. In practice, most levels involve Nobby jumping from one platform to another in order to reach the exit. Various enemies inhabit the levels. Contact with an enemy is fatal to Nobby, but there are anthills scattered around the levels, and Nobby can take a quick nosh at an anthill, stuffing his cheeks full of ants. He can then spit the ants at an enemy to defeat it. Later levels vary the gameplay by having Nobby fly in a hot air balloon or navigate a maze-like mine shaft.

On November 26, 2005, he was kidnapped in Baghdad along with three others: Harmeet Singh Sooden (Canadian) and Norman Kember (British), both members of the delegation he was leading; and Tom Fox (American), a full-time member of CPT who had been working in Iraq since September 2004. The widely publicized hostage crisis (see 2005-2006 Christian Peacemaker hostage crisis) ended on March 23, 2006 when Loney, Kember and Sooden were freed in a clandestine military operation led by British Special Forces. Tom Fox was killed on March 9, two weeks before the release of the other hostages. While Loney was held as a hostage, his family and partner Dan Hunt withheld the fact of his homosexuality out of fear for his safety. The media was aware of this fact but cooperated in keeping it secret.The News is Out , Antonia Zerbisias, Toronto Star, March 27, 2006 He made a brief media appearance on March 30: \\"I'll take things slowly until I can get through a day without shaking legs and a pounding heart,\\" he said.  Early life  Loney was born in Calgary, Alberta, and was raised in Thunder Bay and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. During his late teens he worked as a counsellor at Columbus Boys' Camp near Orillia, Ontario, on Lake Simcoe. This was a summer camp for underprivileged boys, funded by the Knights of Columbus and staffed by senior high school students from various schools run by the Basilian Fathers until 2002, when it was sold to Stu Saunders, who turned it into a leadership camp. Loney was a founding member Zacchaeus House, one of several houses that were part of the Toronto Catholic Worker. From 1990 to 2001 he was a member of the Zacchaeus House community—a house of hospitality which welcomes people in need of housing. While no longer an active part of the community, Zacchaues House continues to function today. After release In June 2006, Loney entered headlines again for joining in the protest against the controversial use of security certificates to detain foreign residents in Canada for years without charges or trial. On June 20, 2006, Loney and several other staff members of the Ontario Catholic Youth Leadership Camp held a press conference in Toronto in which they claimed the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic charitable organization, shut down the camp after learning about Loney's sexual orientation upon his return from captivity. The Ontario Knights of Columbus denied this was the reason for closing the camp. The camp re-opened the following summer under the same name but with a new director and staff. On that same day, Loney and his partner Hunt were honoured at the Toronto 2006 Pride Day Gala with the Fearless Award. According to a November 11, 2006 report in the Guelph Mercury of a speech he'd given to university students on November 9, Loney refused to wear a poppy on Remembrance Day. Loney claimed that it \\"says we have to be ready for the next time - vigilance.\\" Canadian singer-songwriter, Jon Brooks, wrote two songs on Loney's CD Ours And The Shepherds in response to the controversy. Jim Loney's Prayer Part I and Jim Loney's Prayer Part II were chosen as bookends to the track-list on a CD about Canadian war stories. On December 8, 2006, Loney, Kember and Sooden publicly forgave their captors at a press conference held at St. Ethelburga's Peace Center, London, England. On this same day a year before their kidnappers had threatened to execute them. In their joint statement of forgiveness they said, \\"We unconditionally forgive our captors for abducting and holding us. We have no desire to punish them,\\" and \\"Should those who have been charged with holding us hostage be brought to trial and convicted, we ask that they be granted all possible leniency. We categorically lay aside any rights we may have over them.\\" On May 23, 2007, Loney released a public statement saying that he would not be testifying against his captors who are now in U.S. custody citing the lack of transparency in Iraqi courts, the limited access to lawyers and the death penalty. > I recently informed the RCMP that I will not testify. I cannot participate > in a judicial process where the prospects of a fair trial are negligible, > and more crucially, where the death penalty is a possibility. Loney and Harmeet Singh Sooden were among 250 Canadians who risked charges under Canada's anti-terrorism legislation in the spring of 2009 for contributing towards a plane ticket for Abousfian Abdelrazik, a Canadian man who was detained by the Sudanese government at Canada’s request, tortured, imprisoned for two years without charge and then denied travel documents to return to Canada. The ticket Loney helped purchase exposed how the government was actively blocking his return and led to the June 2009 court ruling which forced the Canadian government to bring him home. Loney was one of 30 supporters who were on hand to welcome Abdelrazik home upon his arrival at Toronto's Pearson International Airport on June 27, 2009.

Mohammad Reza Shah was famous for his love of sports cars, and he was known for taking one of his many cars late at night and racing on the highways around Tehran. After he fled the country in January 1979, the cars first stayed untouched. During the revolutionary chaos some were stolen from the palaces, others were put into hiding: either stored in garages, hidden underground, or even pushed into water. Two Rolls-Royces (the Silver Ghost and the Phantom IV) were in the UK for restoration when the Revolution broke out in Iran. The Pahlavi's claimed them to be their private property. But, after 11 years of legal dispute Iran finally succeeded in having them transferred to Iran. At one place in time reportedly more than 1000 cars were sold by authorities of the Islamic Republic in one deal to an Arab Prince for 2 billion Rials, roughly 5 million US$ at that time. Obviously these luxury items were regarded leavings of the \\"decadent monarchic times\\" and of no value to the now Islamic country. Only by vigilance of other Iranian authorities the export of these items of unmeasurable value (some believe even exceeding the value of the crown jewels of the national treasury of Iran) was stopped literally at the banks of the Persian Gulf, in the harbour of Bandar Abbas, and returned to Tehran. Since then the late Shah's cars are regarded part of the national heritage. The Daimler company of Germany is said to have offered several million Euros to purchase the Mercedes 500 K Autobahn-Kurier for its Museum in Stuttgart (Mercedes-Benz Museum), to the Cultural Heritage Organization of Iran - but without success. Prior to the inauguration of the museum in 2001, run mainly by private initiative of Iranian car enthusiasts, a small portion of the remaining 1200 cars were recovered, cleaned and put into the museum to display to the public. More than 1000 cars still reside in storage, garage or in Parks (e.g. in the park of Sa'dabad Palace) and wait to be made accessible to the public.

Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Turner was the first African American to receive a graduate degree at the University of Cincinnati and most likely the first African American to earn a PhD from the University of Chicago. He spent most of his career as a high school teacher in Sumner High School in St. Louis.  Biography  = Personal life = Charles Henry Turner was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 3, 1867. Notably, his birth came two years after the end of the Civil War. He was born to parents Thomas Turner and Addie Campbell, a church custodian and nurse, respectively. He was married to Leontine Troy (1886) and the couple had three children; Henry Owen Turner (1892–1956), Louise Mae Turner (1892,1894-?), and Darwin Romanes Turner (1894–1983). After the death of his first wife, Leontine Troy in 1895, Turner remarried Lillian Porter Turner sometime between 1907 and 1908. The two remained married until Turner's death in 1923. He died on February 14, 1923 from acute myocarditis in Chicago. His place of interment is Lincoln Cemetery in Chicago. He is the paternal grandfather of Boston City Councillor and community organizer Chuck Turner. = Academic career = In 1886, Turner graduated valedictorian of Woodard High School, marking the start of his academic career. He began college at the University of Cincinnati in 1886 and graduated with B.S. degree in biology in 1891. During his undergraduate education, he was mentored by early comparative psychologist and biologist, Clarence L. Herrick. A summary of his undergraduate thesis on the neuroanatomy of bird brains was published in the journal Science in 1891. Tuner earned his M.S. degree in 1892 from the University of Cincinnati under his undergraduate advisor, Herrick. The same year, Turner became the first African-American to publish an article in Science. Immediately after earning his M.S., Turner served as an assistant instructor in the biology laboratory at the University of Cincinnati until 1893. Turner began a PhD at Denison University from 1893–1894, but the program was discontinued. He attained a professorship in the Science Department at Clark University, where he also served as the Chair of the Science Department. The Turner-Tanner Hall at Clark University is now named in his honor. Sources fail to determine his length of service, but it is estimated that he was at Clark sometime between 1893 until 1905. After his time at Clark University, Turner had his first career experience at a high school in 1906 when he obtained a position as the principle of College Hill High School in Cleveland, Tennessee. He then resigned the position in order to pursue a professorship in biology and chemistry at Haines Normal and Industrial Institute in Augusta, Georgia in 1907. While he was teaching, he continued to study insect behavior. During this period of time, Turner pursued his PhD in zoology at the University of Chicago. He spent the 1906–1907 academic year and the summer of 1906 working on his degree before graduating magna cum laude in 1907. He was the third African American person to receive a PhD from the University of Chicago. He was advised by zoologists Charles M. Child, Frank R. Lillie, and Charles O. Whitman. In 1908, Turner gained a teaching position at Sumner High School, where he remained until his retirement in 1922 due to ill health. It is somewhat contested whether Turner chose to teach in high school or if he was unable to find a permanent position in academia. Between 1893–1908, Turner applied for a position at the Tuskegee Institute. Charles I. Abramson, in his 2003 article on Turner for American Bee Journal, claims that Turner was unable, rather than unwilling, to get an appointment at the University of Chicago, and that the Tuskegee Institute could not afford his salary.  Scientific contributions  Turner published 49 papers on invertebrates, including \\"Habits of Mound-Building Ants\\", \\"Experiments on the Color Vision of the Honeybee\\", \\"Hunting Habits of an American Sand Wasp\\", and \\"Psychological Notes on the Gallery Spider\\". A large amount of Turner's research was conducted while he was teaching high school classes at Sumner. While at Sumner, he published 41 papers between 1908 and his death. Notably, Turner published three times in the journal Science. In his research, Turner became the first person to prove that insects can hear and can distinguish pitch. In addition, he first discovered that cockroaches can learn by trial and error and that honeybees can see color and patterns. Turner conducted a large majority of his bee research at O’Fallon Park in North St. Louis, Missouri. Selected publications include:   Other contributions  Besides his scientific work, Turner was active in the struggle to obtain social and educational services for African Americans in St. Louis, Missouri. Two years after his death, The Charles Henry Turner Open Air School for Crippled Children was founded. The school was later renamed as Turner Middle School.

Zobole's paintings, originally oil on canvas, later switching to oil on board, reflected the industrial setting of the Rhondda Valleys. A member of the Rhondda Group, a circle of artists from the area, Zobole is seen as one of Wales' \\"most important artists...one of the visionary artists of Wales\\".[Wakelin, Peter; CASW (Contemporary Art Society of Wales) Annual Report, 2003, p.9] Early history Zobole was born in the village of Ystrad, Rhondda, in 1927, to Italian immigrants who had moved to Wales in 1910. He was educated at Porth Grammar School, before spending five years training at the Cardiff College of Art. His time at Cardiff College was notable for the daily commute from the Valleys to Cardiff, as it was used as an opportunity for Zobole and five fellow students to discuss and critique their art work. Although the six artists never set up a school or published a manifesto, they became known as the Rhondda Group and were an important movement in South Wales art. After leaving Cardiff College, he undertook his service for the British Army, being posted to Palestine and Egypt. On his return from military service he returned to the Rhondda and married his childhood sweetheart, Christina Baker. With little opportunities to find work as an artist, Zobole took up an art teaching post in Llangefni in Anglesey, a position he held from 1953 to 1958. He found this period difficult, he found the flat landscapes dull and uninspiring and described the island as \\"all wind and chapel\\". Zobole also felt apart from the community, a mixture of his inability to speak the Welsh language; which was not a factor in the mainly English speaking Rhondda, and a sense of homesickness. He returned to South Wales in 1957, taking up a post at a Church in Wales school in Aberdare, located in the Cynon Valley a neighbouring valley to the Rhondda. Within two years he found employment teaching within the Rhondda, at Treorchy County Secondary School. Zobole was one of the original members of the campaigning art group, 56 Group Wales.Eric Rowan, \\"Art in Wales: An Illustrated History 1850 - 1980\\", University of Wales Press, Cardiff (1985), pp. 125-129. As an artist Initially Zobole painted as he had been taught at college, but by 1960 he started to experiment with his own style. He originally painted oil on canvas, but he then switched to oil on board and started to use a monochrome colours.Ernest Zobole 1927-1999 Art in Wales He began using impasto, mainly applied with a palette knife. His period of work during the mid 1960s are now regarded as the most daring phase of his career. Zobole was influenced during the 1960s by expressionist refugee artists such as Heinz Koppel, who had a studio in Dowlais. From 1963 to 1984 he became a painting lecturer at Newport Art School. In 1996, he was made an Honorary Fellow of the University of Wales, Swansea. Although Zobole lived and worked in a number of places in Wales, he spent most of his life in Ystrad, where he died in 1999. Zobole described his ethos to painting as: \\"Painting is a part of my life...your breathing I suppose...it is part of what you're about...part of your thinking. It sounds a bit lofty to say that this thing called painting is the whole reason for existing, and if I say yes it is, then accept the fact that I have a lofty thought. The imagery for the work is taken from my immediate surroundings - the house, the outside landscape, and the landscape seen through doors and windows. The outside and inside come together in places. The system used in painting parallels one we use naturally, in that when we examine any situation, we look around or turn our heads, or move our eyes, or more likely, do all three. The differing viewpoints we take in help us build some kind of picture. In making use of these differing viewpoints, plan views, side elevations, end elevations and perspectives are used; eye levels vary, scale varies and emphasis varies; there is also time and memory\\".

A spin-off \\"Escort\\" title of the Tales series, it was released on October 26, 2006. The game makes use of the Tales series' recurring Linear Motion Battle System, customized so characters and actions can be controlled and determined using the DS touch screen, as well as incorporating multiplayer elements. The opening of the game was made by Production I.G (2D animated parts only) and uses the music VS composed by Koda Misono. The game follows Caius Qualls, a Leymon (race of werewolf-like shape-shifters who are persecuted for previous disastrous abuse of their advanced technology) who also have a human blood. With his guardian and parents taken prisoner by the church authorities, he sets out on a quest with other outcasts to save them and overthrow the church's oppressive regime. The game's characteristic genre name is . Tempest was developed by Dimps, along with staff from Namco Tales Studio, including composer Motoi Sakuraba, designers Mutsumi Inomata and Daigo Okomura, and producer Makoto Yoshizumi. As the first title in the series to be developed for the DS, the concept behind it was to create a compact Tales experience for that platform. Yoshizumi moved to delay the game twice before its release so as to refine the experience. Upon release, the game polarized Japanese and western critics, with Famitsu Weekly giving it a notably harsh review. While some have praised the game's story and gameplay, others have faulted these and other aspects such as its technical quality and short length. Originally described by Japanese media as a main title, it was later classified and described by staff as a spin-off. Gameplay Screenshot of a battle in Tales of the Tempest, showing the display, the HUD and the mechanics of the \\"3-on-3 Linear Motion Battle System\\". Tales of the Tempest is an action role-playing video game. The player navigates the playable characters across 3D environments, including the overworld map, towns and dungeons.. The characters and environment are displayed on one screen of the Nintendo DS system, while menu options such as the character's current status are displayed on the other. The world is governed by a day-night cycle, effecting the environment and the behavior of elements within it. For instance, strong enemies appear at night, and towns cannot be accessed, but conversely some items and treasure are only available at night. The battle system is a scaled-down version of the Tales series' recurring Linear Motion Battle System (LMBS), a real-time system similar to a fighting game where character actions are performed at the press of a button, with specific buttons triggering either normal or special attacks. The version used in Tempest is called the \\"3-on-3 LMBS\\". The player controls one character, with the other two available in battle controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. After setting up a formation in advance, players can switch between characters at will during battle. During battles, characters can switch between three plains of movement, as opposed to previous 2D Tales titles which restricted characters to a single plain. This allows for characters to evade or surround enemies. Actions such as healing, character control and item usage are all controlled using the DS touch screen. A stable gameplay element, Cooking, also appears. Cooking creates meals to restore health and Technical Points (used for special attacks). Once the right ingredients have been chosen and a recipe has been selected, the food can be made. Each ingredient is selected and added using the touchscreen. Using the wrong ingredients will make the cooking process go wrong. A meal cannot be used again until the party has rested at an inn or entered battle. Some meals carry a special buff for characters when entering battles. The game's local multiplayer option is unlocked after a certain point in the single-player campaign after obtaining a special item. After that point, players can access a special multiplayer dungeon, where up to three players must work cooperatively to reach the treasure at the dungeon's center. If one of the players is defeated, the team restart at the nearest \\"resurrection point\\". Items and in-game currency are carried over into the single-player campaign, but experience points are not. Synopsis =Setting= Tempest is set on the continent of Areulla, where humans live alongside a half-beast race called Leymons. The Leymons once dominated Areulla, but they gained the ability to command a dangerous technology called Precepts, which was hoped would bring about coexistence between the races. Around the same time, hostile soul-eating spirits called Spots appeared, causing conflict. The experiment to bring about a unification of the races through the creation of the \\"Law of Life\\" entailed the forging of a gem called the Patient, which cost the lives of many Leymons. The Law of Life appeared in an imperfect form, killing most of the Leymon population and plunging the entire continent into chaos before the gateway was closed. In the aftermath, the formerly-weak humans rose up and took control. In later years, the human authorities would rewrite the history into an interracial conflict known as the Beast War, further soiling the Leymon's image. Tempest begins 100 years after the Beast War ends: humans are in dominance, and the Leymon are derogatorily called \\"Lycanths\\", shunned in human settlements or even hunted for rewards. =Characters= Protagonists *Caius Qualls: A boy living together with his foster father in a remote village in Areulla. A Spot attacked his village because he was entrusted with a crystal by a soldier of the Imperial Guard he saved by chance. When he fought with the Spot along with his foster father, the people of the village found out that his foster father was a Lycanth, and they were treated with a cold attitude. Caius is voiced by Motoki Takagi. *Rubia Natwick: A childhood friend of Caius who has lived in the same frontier village since they were children. Since her parents were both priests, she had planned on going to the capital city in order to study; however, her parents were killed by Lukius and his group, who had come to take Caius's father. She journeys with Caius to avenge her parents' deaths at the hands of the inquisitor Rommy. Rubia is voiced by Mai Kadowaki. *Tilkis Barone: He originates from a small country far from Areulla. To investigate a mystery occurring in his country, he travels to the capital city of Areulla. There, he meets with Caius and Rubia. He handles a large sword skillfully and is a very wise person. Tilkis is voiced by Takumi Yamazaki. *Forest Ledoyen: Forest is a Lycanth that immigrated to a small country. He joins the party to save this country from trouble. He knows a lot about the geography of the world, serving as a traveling guide. He may seem intimidating, but is really a nice person overall. Forest is voiced by Kenji Nomura. *Arria Ekberg: Arria Ekberg is a priest of the capital city, but does not support the killing of Lycanths, and instead joins the party to stop what the other priests are doing. She fights with a wand and is very proud of her abilities as a mage. Arria is voiced by Kae Araki. Antagonists *Vincent Bridges: A pope who has two sons with a female Leymon (Melissa Bridges). He became unable to be with her due to race differences, so he raised the youngest son (Lukius), while the oldest one (Caius) was raised by his mother and later by Ramrus. He is voiced by Kobishi Kobayashi. *Lukius Bridges: Son of Vincent Bridges, he's a Leymon hunter who wears a mask while on duty. He is voiced by Mitsuki Saiga. *Rommy: A cold-hearted Spot that helps Lukius to hunt Leymons. She is voiced by Ayumi Sena. *Albert Mueller: Leader of the Black Knights, he feels that his rank is not good enough for him and dreams of one day becoming king of Areulla. He is voiced by Tomohisa Asou. *Areulla VIII: A Spot that is the king of Areulla. Despite reigning for more that 100 years, he still has the body of a child. He is voiced by Katsumi Chou. Development and release The main concept behind Tales of the Tempest was to create a compact version of a standard Tales game. In addition, the team wanted to create a Tales experience that people could play on the go. Later, it was stated that the compression of features for Tempest and the staff's inexperience with the Nintendo DS caused multiple problems, including technical issues. The title, \\"Tempest\\", was derived from the concept of chaotic events and feelings. Makoto Yoshizumi, the producer for Tales of the Abyss, came over to produce the game once Abyss was completed. Tempest was the first Tales title to be developed for the Nintendo DS. It was developed by Japanese game studio Dimps. In contrast to previous Tales games, which featured a sizable amount of voice acting, Tempest restricted voice work to the execution of abilities and the completion of cooking.Tales of the Tempest Original Soundtrack liner notes The characters were designed by Mutsumi Inomata and Daigo Okomura. Tempest was Inomata's fifth time designing for the series. As part of her design, she created the characters with the DS graphics in mind. Okomura, a minor designer for the series, was responsible for designing the characters Albert and Rommy. In contrast to previous titles, which had purely animated openings, the game's opening cutscene used a mixture of CGI sequences created using the in-game graphics and animated segments by Production I.G.. The scenario was written by Shino Taira, Riku Okimata and Makio Kurita. Okimata was brought into the writing process halfway through production. The overall theme of coexistence between different nations and peoples was carried over directly from Abyss and Tales of Rebirth. Its characteristic genre name, a recurring feature in the series, was . One of the main ambitions for the story was to make it comparable with one of the home console Tales games despite the platform and development goals. The game's music was composed by Motoi Sakuraba, the main composer for the Tales series. As his first work for the DS, Sakuraba found composing the music a challenge. One of the main problems was the limited sound capacity of the platform. As a result, it used a high degree of pop music. The title's theme song, \\"VS\\", was performed by misono, a singer who had previously performed the theme song for Tales of Symphonia while she was still a member of Japanese band Day After Tomorrow. The game was originally announced as Tales DS in October 2005, with 2006 as its projected year of release. The game's official title was announced in December 2005. The game's release date was originally set for April 13, 2006. It was later announced that the game would be delayed. Its release date was moved to June 8 of the same year. It was then delayed again, with the release date being set as \\"before the end of 2006\\". The state reason for the delays was that the team needed extra time to properly develop the gameplay functions, which were specially designed for the DS. Yoshizumi later claimed personal responsibility for the delays. Reception In preparation for release, Bandai Namco prepared shipments totaling 301,000 copies. By November 2006, one month after its release, the game has sold 105,288 units. This was described by magazine Nintendo Dream as a fairly poor performance for a Tales game. As of 2008, the game has sold 205,541 units. The game was reviewed twice by Famitsu: once in Famitsu Weekly and once in the dedicated magazine Famitsu DS + Wii. Famitsu Weekly gave it a score of 28/40, with the four reviewers each giving a score of 7. While it praised the battle system, which was stated to be more action-oriented than previous entries, multiple points came in for criticism, including poor companion AI, lack of content, and the limited multiplayer functionality. They also thought 2D graphics would have been better than the 3D models used due to quality issues. Famitsu DS + Wii gave the game a slightly higher score of 30/40, with the reviewers giving it respective scores of 8, 7, 7 and 8. The reviewers found the story \\"appealing\\", and enjoyed the increased focus on action in the battle system. Points of criticism were the map layout and leveling system. Dengeki DS Style praised the game's opening, but was mixed about the battle display and other aspects of gameplay. SoftBank Creative's magazine Gemaga also gave a mixed review, praising the opening song and battle system, but found that the condensing or removal of standard Tales gameplay elements made the game \\"unsatisfactory\\" when compared to its predecessors. Japanese magazine GAME SIDE, in a retrospective on the Tales series, cited the love story between Caius and Rubia as \\"pale\\", faulted the story's short length, and noted that the division of displays between screens during battle put undue pressure on the player. Adam Riley, writing for Cubed3.com, was fairly positive, feeling that many of the Japanese reviews had been overly harsh. While he did find the battle system difficult to handle and the overworld too large, the story, graphics and soundtrack received praise. He also found the game good for short bursts of gameplay, enabling him to make the most of its 12-hour campaign. Kurt Kalata, writing for gaming site Siliconera, was generally negative. He called the game's low-budget look \\"[its] biggest problem\\", while also faulting the story, characters, lack of typical Tales features, and the design of the battle system. In his preview for IGN, Anoop Gantayat found the game fairly enjoyable despite impressions given by its delayed release, though he found issues with the touch screen controls. Legacy Several pieces of merchandise were created to either promote or supplement the game. As part of the promotion for the game, a 32-page booklet titled , was created, including an interview with Inomata and trivia concerning the game and series. Three different guides to the game were published between October 2006 and February 2007. A two-part novel based on the game was published by Super Dash Bunko: the two volumes were titled and . They were released in January and March 2007. The novels were written by Ryunosuke Kingetsu and illustrated by Inomata. They included extra stories and character development not included in the original game. The game's soundtrack album, , was released on February 27, 2007. The album included an audio drama written by Okimata, portraying events between Caius and Rubia during the ending. The game was originally described as a main entry in the Tales series. After the game's release, with the announcement of Tales of Innocence in July 2007, the series was divided between mainline \\"Mothership\\" titles and spin-off \\"Escort\\" titles. Tempest, described by Yoshizumi in 2007 as a precursor to Innocence, was officially reclassified as an Escort title at this point. It was speculated by Game Informer that the game's lack of critical and fan acclaim that caused the change, but this has not been confirmed. The game has yet to receive a western localization. Later, staff members of Innocence stated that Tempest was seen as a spin-off while still in development. After the release of the Vita port of Innocence, Innocence R, artwork found in that game caused speculation that Tempest might be remade. The \\"Triverse\\" connection between the three developed DS titles was established by Bandai Namdo producer Takashi Yota: first featuring in Innocence R, they were included in Tales of Hearts R after positive fan feedback. In 2014, it was revealed that Bandai Namco had been considering a remake of Tempest for some time, and that there was demand for both a remake by Japanese fans and a western release. So far, nothing has been announced.

Outside of the Far East, the game is hosted by PapayaPlay, who services the game for both Europe and North America. Though the game can be downloaded free of charge, War Rock requires online registration.  Gameplay  WarRock is developed in Episodes; similar to TV programming but inverted (four seasons make up one episode). Currently WarRock is on Episode IV, Season 2 - suggesting that WarRock is in its 10th incarnation. The game is set in the midst of a nuclear war in the fictional Republic of Derbaran. Players select between the two teams and engage in battles using 20th and 21st century military equipment, including a large assortment of infantry weapons and vehicles. Derbaran is the government army (yellow camouflage) and NIU is the rebel army (green camouflage). During most combat modes, players are divided into these two teams and compete as an army against each other. War Rock games are divided into six main modes of play: Conquest Mode, Capture the Base, Individual Death Match - One Man Army, Bombing Mission,Team Death Match and AI mode. *Conquest Mode is a game mode where two teams fight to capture neutral bases as well as an enemy base. When the game starts, kill points of both teams will start to decrease. However, when a team has more bases captured than the other team, the rate of decrease in kill points will be slower than the other team. On the other hand, if a team has fewer bases, then the kill points decrease at a faster rate than the enemy team. *Capture the Base match begins with a neutral base in the middle. Both Derbaran and NIU teams respawn from their bases, and when any of the teams first capture the neutral base, the team occupying more bases changes to a defending team and the other team becomes a challenger. The defending team can win the match when they have successfully defended their bases for a certain period of time. Therefore, the challenging team must take over the base within the given time period. *Individual Death Match - One Man Army-Everyone fights each other until a person gets a certain number of kills and wins. Depending on the number of players in the room, small or medium size map can be selected. *Bombing Mission-The goal of this match is to bomb a selected area. Derbarans must install the bomb successfully, and NIU team must prevent the Derbarans from exploding the bomb in the designated area. Players can install/defuse the bomb by pressing the ‘F’ key. Both teams’ fate will be decided within the 3 minutes and 30 seconds of mission time. *In a Team Death Match, a team, which gets a certain number of kills wins the game. Players can respawn and enter the battlefield again when they die. Up to 32 players can connect to a War Rock game simultaneously, and players will be able to experience more excitement and intensity than any other FPS games. *In AI Mode, users fight against Bots with AI. As a player kills more bots, higher points and rank can be obtained. Kill as many bots as you can and aim for the highest points and rank! The game features deathmatch-based multiplayer modes, all of which feature objectives that must be completed in order for teams to win. Sessions end either when a team has reached a preset number of points, or the allotted time expires in which case the team with the most points wins. Not all the game modes are kill based. The player's performance is tracked with experience points and in-game money which players can earn several ways including defeating opponents, or completing objectives. As players gain experience, they will advance in level, allowing access to new weapons and items, which can be bought with money earned in the game. War Rock features a clan system, that allows members to engage in clan wars whilst representing their specific clans. Reception IGN rated it a \\"mediocre\\" 5.9 and GameSpot rated the game 5.5 out of 10.

Grammatical elements that encode the semantic category of mirativity are called miratives (abbreviated ). DeLancey (1997) first promoted the mirative as a cross-linguistic category, identifying Turkish, Hare, Sunwar, Lhasa Tibetan, and Korean as languages exhibiting this category. Citing DeLancey as a predecessor, many researchers have reported miratives in other languages, especially Tibeto-Burman languages. However, Lazard (1999) and Hill (2012) question the validity of this category, Lazard finding that the category cannot be distinguished from a mediative, and Hill finds the evidence given by DeLancey and by Aikhenvald (2004) either incorrect or insufficient. DeLancey (2012) promotes Hare, Kham, and Magar as clear cases of miratives, conceding that his analysis of Tibetan had been incorrect. He makes no mention of Turkish, Sunwar, or Korean. Hill (2015) provides an alternative analysis of Hare, re-analyzing DeLancey's evidence for 'mirativity' as direct evidentiality. Navajo has mirativity in combination with evidentiality.

Methods  The \\"bolt-on\\" method is used frequently on solid body electric guitars and on acoustic flattop guitars. In the typical electric guitar neck joint, the body and neck cross in horizontal plane, the neck is inserted in a pre-routed \\"pocket\\" in the body, and they are joined using four or sometimes three (rarely, five or more) screws. As the pressure of screw heads damages the wood surfaces, and the undistributed stress could put the instrument body at structural risk, typically a rectangular metal plate (or a pair of smaller plates) is used to secure the joint and re-distribute the screw pressure more evenly. Such a plate is usually criticized for making playing on top frets uncomfortable, so manufacturers sometimes employ some kind of more intricate method to hide a metal plate, smooth the angles and make access to top frets easier. However, a visible metal plate is usually considered as a part of \\"vintage\\" style, and provides a ready location to emboss a manufacturer's logos, stamp serial numbers, or include decorative artwork. Some makers of electric guitars with bolt-on necks (Fender in particular) write a production date on the heel of the component neck, where it is hidden when the neck is attached to the body. The neck can then be removed to check the date, which is often cross-referenced with the serial number to accurately date and identify the guitar.Fender Serial Number Guide article at the Guitar Repair Bench Luthier Website = Bolted joints as opposed to wood screw = The term \\"bolt-on\\" is usually a misnomer, introduced mostly by Fender whose electric guitars and basses have largely had component necks held to the instrument's body with wood screws. Actual bolted joints (i.e., a bolt coupled with a nut) exist — particularly in acoustic guitars — but are less common in electric guitars. One particular example of a bolt-on neck using an actual bolt is Brian May's homemade Red Special, which uses a single bolt held in place by the guitar's truss rod and secured with a nut on the rear of the body. An acoustic guitar bolt-on neck popularized by Taylor Guitars includes threaded inserts in the heel of the neck. Bolts inserted through the neck block of the body from inside the instrument attach the neck to the body.Bolt-on Neck Joint for Acoustic Instruments article at Liutaio Mottola Lutherie Information Website = \\"Bolt-in\\" as opposed to \\"bolt-on\\" = Some sources Bolt-in neck at Sweetwater.com music technology glossary Neck construction article at Ed Roman Guitars differentiate bolt-on and bolt-in neck construction. The difference is that a bolt-on neck involves constructing a protruding flange that fits inside a routed pocket in the guitar body. Then the neck is secured inside this pocket using screws that run perpendicular (at right angles) to the surface of the guitar. In contrast, a bolt-in neck doesn't need to have such a flange inside the guitar body, and screws or bolts run parallel to the surface of guitar, entering the back of the heel. William Cumpiano's hardware-based neck joint , featuring drawings that illustrate basics of bolt-in method. This requires the instrument to have a deep, preferably hollow body, which restricts the use of this method to acoustic guitars. However, given that bolt-in necks are relatively uncommon in electric guitars, most luthiers call both neck joints \\"bolt-on\\".  Advantages  Luthiers and guitar players cite both advantages and disadvantages of bolt-on neck construction. Many of these views are highly subjective and relative; instrument manufacture varies widely and, lacking parallel objective factors, any particular claim might not be applicable generally. Cited advantages of bolt-on neck include: * easier and cheaper to mass produce. If a guitar of neck-through construction is damaged during the assembly process or otherwise fails its final quality evaluation, the instrument might need to be entirely scrapped; for instance, an irreparable neck flaw requires destruction of an otherwise perfect body, or a finish flaw would require that the entire instrument be refinished. This costs the manufacturer not only materials but the time and manpower involved (at best, salvaging only the hardware). Set- neck instruments (including most acoustic guitars) may be more readily repairable than neck-through, but separating the glue-set joint takes a skilled luthier away from productive duties. The bolt-on style is ideally suited to large-scale assembly lines, defective components are readily separated or replaced by unskilled workers, and recovery costs are minimized. * easier to repair (if damaged) or to modify. Necks that allow Fender \\"standard\\" four-screw joint are widely interchangeable (provided they are intended for the same style of guitar, e.g., either Stratocaster or Telecaster).What we love about Fenders at Guitar DNA An aftermarket neck may be readily ordered, selected for the specific preferences of the player (neck shape, fingerboard radius, types of wood, finish, fret profile) and installed by someone relatively unskilled, using only commonly available tools. As well, if a guitar's body is damaged beyond practical repair, the neck is easily paired with another body. Ready removal significantly eases the repair process, whether of neck or body. * easy to control. The height of a guitar's strings at the bridge is not always ideal, and varies in a mass-production environment. The solution is to change the neck-to-body angle, which is impossible with a neck-through design and difficult with a set-neck. A bolt-on neck can readily have a shim inserted between the heel and body, or even have the heel planed fractionally to change the angle (this method is much superior to shims both structurally and tonally). Some bolt-on designs incorporate an adjustment screw that provides fine adjustment for the neck-to-body angle, such as the Fender \\"Micro-Tilt\\" adjustment as used on their Deluxe American Stratocaster. * more attack and \\"snap\\", slightly brighter tone, more resonance and sustain. All of these are debated.  Disadvantages  Disadvantages of bolt-on construction include: * upper-fret restriction. Because of the structural necessity of attaching the body to the neck, the result is that the heel area is required to be comparatively thick. In addition, the hardware (particularly a heel plate) adds obstruction. These factors limit how much material can be removed in a cutaway, and then block access to part of whatever room can be achieved. Various designs have been employed to mitigate this, from a contoured heel plate or replacing the plate with a countersunk ferrule under each screw head, up to idiosyncratic neck joint designs such as the Ibanez AANJ (All Access Neck Joint), the Music Man Silhouette, and the Stephen's Extended Cutaway as used by Washburn (particularly the higher-end Nuno Bettencourt signature models). * sloppy construction or assembly exacerbates any of its inherent disadvantages.  Manufacturers  Notable manufacturers of guitars with bolt-on necks include: * Fender * Squier * Music Man * Yamaha * Ibanez * Kiesel Guitars/Carvin * ESP Guitars * Epiphone * G&L; * Suhr * Hagström * Taylor acoustics, using a patented bolt-in construction process with three bolts * Seagull, an acoustic guitar brand manufactured by Godin. * Jackson * Charvel * Cort Guitars  References  Category:Guitar neck joints ","title":"Bolt-on neck"},{"id":"3400692","text":"The Bilingual Education Act (BEA), also known as the Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Amendments of 1967, was the first United States federal legislation that recognized the needs of limited English speaking ability (LESA) students. The BEA was introduced in 1967 by Texas senator Ralph Yarborough and was both approved by the 90th United States Congress and signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson on January 2, 1968. While some states, such as California and Texas, and numerous local school districts around the country already had policies and programs designed to meet the special educational needs of elementary and secondary school students not fluent in the English language, this act signaled that the federal government now also recognized the need for and value of bilingual education programs in U.S. public education. Passed on the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, its purpose was to provide school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. Cultural implications The BEA was a significant piece of education legislation. Its passage signaled \\"a shift from the notion that students should be afforded equal educational opportunity to the idea that educational policy should work to equalize academic outcomes, even if such equity demanded providing different learning environments.\\"Petrzela, Natalia M. \\"Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California.\\" Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010):408. Additionally, it reflected changes in cultural perspectives towards diversity and immigration. The BEA was an important shift away from the late 1950s anticommunist sentiment where anything foreign was suspect, which had destroyed many earlier local and state attempts at bilingual education.Petrzela, Natalia M. \\"Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California.\\" Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 414. Furthermore, it recognized that the federal government was responsible for educating immigrants to the US and opened doors for bilingual education projects on local, state, and federal levels. Furthermore, this legislation, successfully enacted into law largely thanks to the efforts of Spanish speakers, has become an important part of the \\"polemic between assimilation and multiculturalism\\" and the role that language education in our society.Wiese, Ann-Marie and Eugene E. Garcia. \\"The Bilingual Education Act: Language Minority Students and Equal Educational Opportunity.\\" Bilingual Research Journal, 22 (1998):3. Because the BEA in its original form promoted celebrating linguistic and cultural differences and diversity in the U.S., it in many ways challenged assimilationist theories and the \\"melting pot\\" concept of the U.S. And yet, in its final form when passed, it did not mention the important link between language and culture, leaving the language vague. The act additionally opened up a larger need for teachers who could teach language and other content within a language besides English. This placed a strain on the teaching pool available in 1968 and even today there is a shortage of teachers for these highly specialized positions. Culturally, it was argued in this time period that by teaching in a certain language it also taught specific values instead of just a way of communication.Rodriguez, Armando \\"Bilingual Education and the Foreign Language Teacher.\\" Paper presented at the National Convention of the American Association of Teachers of Spanish and Portuguese (50th, San Antonio, Texas, August 28–30, 1968)., 8 (1968), http://search.proquest.com/docview/64405323 Implementation and funding When Senator Yarborough introduced the bill to the Senate in 1967, he envisioned it as a way of addressing the \\"'poor performance in school and high dropout rates... and great psychological harm' caused by 'English-only policies, no Spanish-speaking rules, and cultural degradation'\\" that was evident in many schools at the time.Petrzela, Natalia M. \\"Before the Federal Bilingual Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California.\\" Peadbody Journal of Education, 85: 406, 2010. Although the passage of the act was a bipartisan effort on behalf of Republicans and Democrats, it underwent significant changes between 1967 and 1968. Many of these changes were in the wording and framing of the act, which ultimately did not recognize the importance of biculturalism or the benefit of bilingualism or even the link between language and culture. Rather, it framed students of LESA as a \\"problem\\" that needed to be fixed. In addition, unlike what Yarborough had conceived, it provided no funding for permanent programs regarding students of LESA, as many people feared promoting a sense of entitlement in students and families benefitting from the act. The BEA provided school districts with federal funds, in the form of competitive grants, to establish innovative educational programs for students with limited English speaking ability. The grants that the act provided were given directly to school districts and were to be used to buy resources for educational programs, to train teachers and teachers' aides, to develop and distribute materials and to create meaningful parental involvement projects. Although the act did not require the use of bilingual instruction or the use of a student's native language, its aim was to encourage innovative programs designed to teach students English. The act also gave school districts the opportunity to provide bilingual education programs without violating segregation laws, but at this time, participation was voluntary. Program effectiveness was evaluated at the end of every year and successful programs were eligible to receive federal funding for up to five years. Because the BEA funding was provided in the form of grants, most of the financial clout lay with local and state education agencies (LEAs and SEAs). However, the federal government limited the reach of these funds in a few significant ways. To begin with, from a simple framing standpoint, the original 1968 BEA did not include any mention of instruction in or maintenance of a student's native language, limiting the potential impact of the act. From a financial perspective, the BEA was also limited. The only programs eligible for receiving funding were programs for children between the ages of 3 and 8. Because it was meant to redress the dropout issue, the act with this caveat on funding viewed high school students of LESA somewhat of a lost cause. In addition, the act did not fund any permanent programs for educating students of LESA, but only funding exploratory programs. As a result, it did not seek to truly address the burgeoning issue of how to educate students who were not English dominant. Lastly, the funds were at first reserved for communities whose average income was below the poverty line stated in the ESEA ($3,000 in 1968). This limitation on funding had the unfortunate side effect of framing the act as a somewhat of a handout to poor, Latino communities.Petrzela, Natalia M. \\"Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California.\\" Peabody Journal of Education, 85 (2010): 411. Due to many of these limitations and the vague wording of much of the BEA, funding was limited in the first three years to $85 million. By 1972, \\"only 100,391 students nationally, out of approximately 5,000,000 in need were enrolled in a Title VII-funded program.\\"Petrzala, Natalia M. \\"Before the Federal Bilingual Education Act: Legislation and Lived Experience in California. Peabody Journal of Education, 85: 414. Amendments to the Bilingual Education Act =1974 amendments= The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 was not specific and participation by school districts was voluntary. As a result, Civil rights activists argued that the rights of minority-language students were being violated under this act. In 1974, three amendments were made to the original act in an attempt to clarify the intent and design of programs designated for the education of LESA students. There were two significant events that impacted these changes: the Lau v. Nichols case and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974. Lau v. Nichols was a class-action suit brought against the San Francisco Unified School District and alleged that due to their inability to speak English, there were 1,800 Chinese students who were being denied an equal education. In 1974, the Supreme Court overruled the ruling of the lower courts and determined that the same resources, teachers and curriculum did not imply that the education was equal for students who had a limited command of the English language. In the same year as the Supreme Court's ruling, the Equal Education Opportunity Act was passed. By citing instructional programs as the means through which language barriers were to be broken, it effectively extended the Lau ruling to all students and school districts. Furthermore, school districts were required to have special programs for LESA students regardless of federal or state funding. The amendments in 1974 served to do the following: * define \\"Bilingual Education Program\\" as one that provided instruction in English and in the native language of the student to allow the student to progress effectively through the educational system * define the program's goal to prepare LESA students to participate effectively in the regular classroom as quickly as possible while simultaneously maintaining the native language and culture of the student * create regional support centers of consultants and trainers to provide support to school systems * stipulate capacity-building efforts by providing funds to school districts' efforts to expand curricula, staff and research for bilingual programs Funding increased from $7.5 million in 1968 to $68 million and as a result, programs were able to impact 368,000 students. =1978 amendments= In 1978, further amendments were made to extend the act and broaden the definition of eligible students. Specifically, these amendments served to do the following: * emphasize the strictly transitional nature of native language instruction * expand eligibility to students who are limited English proficient (LEP) * permit enrollment of English-speaking students in bilingual programs Funding increased from $68 million in 1974 to $135 million which was enough to provide funding for 565 school districts and for secondary programs including service centers, graduate school fellowships and training for undergraduate students interested in becoming bilingual educators. =1984 amendments= In 1984, the Bilingual Education Act was further modified. The amendments enacted during this time served to: * increase the flexibility in the implementation of programs for LEP students by providing school districts with more autonomy and independence in deciding how these students should be taught * allow school districts to apply for funding for different, innovative programs that best met the needs of their students Funding for these amendments was $139.4 million and there was a heavy emphasis placed on districts using the funding to build enough capacity to eventually be able to support LEP programs without federal government funding. =1988 amendments= The BEA was amended again in 1988. The changes this year served to: * increase funding to state education agencies * expand funding for \\"special alternative\\" programs * create fellowship programs for professional training Funding for the 1988 amendments was $159 million, with regulations for how the money should be divided. Specifically, at least 60% should be spent developing programs and at least 25% of funds should be spent on training. =1994 reauthorization= The Bilingual Education Act (BEA) reauthorization in 1994 maintained the same tenets as the original BEA, introduced new grant categories, set up preference to programs promoting bilingualism, and took into account indigenous languages. Overall, the premise of this addition was to introduce a more systemic reform. *Priority given to bilingualism programs: Though the Bilingual Education Act legislation did not prescribe specific instructional practices, it did provide a guide to help language minority students. The 1994 reauthorization gave preference to grant applications that developed bilingual proficiency, which Local Education Agencies had the right to develop themselves based on the guidelines of the BEA. *In the FY2000 691 Bilingual Education Instructional Service Grants were given out totaling just over $162 million. The largest grants in FY2000 were given to the state of California and New York at approximately $58 million and $22.5 million respectively. *1994 California Proposition 187 was introduced in order to prevent illegal immigrants from obtaining state provided health care, social services and public education. This was voted on by the public and became a law in November 1994. Citizens challenged the constitutionality of this proposition and in March 1998 it was ruled unconstitutional and was taken away. Though the law did not last, it impacted students who were ELL throughout the mid-to-late 1990s. Significant court decisions *Meyer v. Nebraska was the first U.S. Supreme Court case that addressed American education of foreign-languages. This case did away with a Nebraska law that prevented public and private schools from offering instruction in any language but English. '\\"The protection of the [U.S.] Constitution extends to all, to those who speak other languages as well as to those born with English on the tongue,\\" Supreme Court Justice James C. McReynolds wrote. The decision established the principle that parents have a constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children, including their education.'. *Lau v. Nichols was a case brought forward, in which Chinese-American students attending a public school in San Francisco alleged that the failure to provide bilingual instruction to all non-English speaking students violated their rights to education due to limited English comprehension. The case did not create a specific remedy, yet in conjunction with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ruled in favor of the students, thus expanding the rights of students with limited English proficiency. *Serna v. Portales was a case that dictated when a \\"substantial group\\" of students with limited English proficiency was present, bilingual education was required. *Aspira v. N.Y. Board of Education required testing for students in English and their native language in order to understand if they should receive additional services and bilingual education. *Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado stated that students should receive instruction in their native language and English until proficiency in English is achieved.Keyes v. School District No.1, Denver, Colorado, 413 U.S. 189(1973)url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0413_0189_ZS.html n.d. 9 Oct 2011 *Flores v. Arizona stated that Arizona must do more to fund instruction for ELL students. The Arizona courts rejected tenets of the NCLB law that changed the services provided to ELL students. This case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. *Castañeda v. Pickard in 1981 created a basis for pedagogically addressing Limited English Proficiency (LEP) students. It required that districts have a plan for addressing LEP students, that schools provide qualified staff to implement that plan, and that the district has developed an effective evaluation protocol for the program. Though this case did create a more structured plan pedagogically it did not require bilingual education programs to meet these same standards. \\"It required only that 'appropriate action to overcome language barriers' be taken through well implemented programs.\\" The Bilingual Education Act and No Child Left Behind No Child Left Behind (NCLB), passed in 2002, had a significant impact on bilingual education and the Bilingual Education Act in the United States due to its emphasis on high-stakes testing. As a result of NCLB and its emphasis on testing, the Bilingual Education Act was renamed the English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement Act. The name change alone of BEA under NCLB is significant in that it signals a shift in the philosophical approach to bilingual education. Essentially, even though the act still leaves with state and local educators the ability to choose from instructional methods, \\"the statement of purpose and accountability requirements make clear that the primary objective is English acquisition.\\"Moran, Rachel F. \\"Bilingual Education Act: Equal Education Opportunities: History, Politics, Theory, and Practice. JRank. JRank. n.d. 9 Oct 2011 Under NCLB, school success and failure is linked to performance on standardized tests. However, this measure subjects English Language Learners (ELLs) \\"to critical assessments without adequate preparation.\\"Hilner, Benjamin. \\"'Bad Policy and Bad Law'\\": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational POlicy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause.\\" Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 4. The lack of preparation is due to the fact that NCLB caps funding for bilingual education programs at half of what it had been and does not require that any bilingual education programs undergo periodic evaluation, a measure required by the Casteñada v. Pickard court case. And yet, despite this lack of preparation, ELLs performance on standardized tests can jeopardize a school's access to funding. In essence, \\"This turns the question of whether or not a school receives a failing label into a question of how many ELLs attend.\\"Hilner, Benjamin. \\"'Bad Policy and Bad Law'\\": The Shortcomings of the No Child Left Behind Act in Bilingual Educational Policy and its Frustration of the Equal Protection Clause.\\" Educational Law Consortium Journal. (2005): 5. Because the impact of NCLB on ELLs has significant implications on ELLs and their communities' access to education, NCLB is in conflict with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in that it denies \\"access to a federally funded program based on their skin color or race.\\" The changes in the BEA under NCLB created a grant program that attempted to enhance English language acquisition. The ruling placed ELL students in a similar classroom environment as their peers for whom English is not a second language. The law did not require schools to provide bilingual programs and placed them against the rigorous content standards put in place by State Education Agencies. When ELLs were tested with the same state assessments or the National Assessment for Educational Progress (NAEP), it was shown that compared to their fluently English-speaking peers the ELL students displayed larger deficits in both reading and math. The 2007 NAEP test, showed increased deficits in both math and reading following a surge of the ELL population in the United States. By 2005 the number of English-learners throughout the US had risen 57% over the prior decade to approximately 5.1 million students. After NCLB was enacted it was shown that there were sufficient numbers of prospective teachers, yet there were insufficient numbers of these teachers entering certain fields. Among these specializations were science, math, foreign languages, special education and namely bilingual education. Several initiatives formed to specifically recruit teachers to these specialization fields and allowed for alternative certification paths. These teacher shortages continue to exist today and are seen to a greater extent in high-poverty districts.Salinas, Roselia. \\"TEACHER QUALITY AS A PREDICTOR OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IN URBAN SCHOOLS: A NATIONAL FOCUS.\\" Educational Law Consortium Journal. The Lamar University – Electronic Journal of Student Research (2006): 5. The act and NCLB say that the accommodations that it provides should be interpreted in concordance with federal civil rights laws. \\"As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and federal civil rights officials, these provisions rely on terms like “affirmative steps” and “appropriate action” that give school districts the discretion to use a range of instructional approaches. As a result, under both Title VI and the EEOA, courts and federal enforcement agencies must decide on a case-by-case basis whether programs are in fact overcoming linguistic barriers to full participation.\\" The policy still remains highly-debated at both the state and federal level.

Career =Chelsea= By the time he was 17 years old, he was captain of the under 18 national side, and was signed by Premier League club Chelsea in October 1998. Dalla Bona's move to London saw the Italian Football Federation amend the legislation regarding the sale of their young players. The young midfielder was brought into the youth and reserve team squads at Chelsea first, gaining a reputation for prolific goalscoring with 16 reserve team goals, winning the club golden boot in 1998–99.ChelseaFC.com In the same season, he was voted Chelsea's young player of the year. He made his senior team debut for the club against Feyenoord in the Champions League a year later in November 1999. The following season, 2000-01, Dalla Bona got an extended run in the side, making 32 appearances in that season and scoring 2 goals. He was boosted further by the departure of older midfielders Dennis Wise and Gustavo Poyet in 2001 and some impressive performances. In his final season at Chelsea, 2001-02, he contributed 4 more goals in the Premier League, including an injury time winner against Ipswich Town and the third in a 4-0 thrashing of Liverpool. He also played during some of the matches in Chelsea's 2001–02 FA Cup run; the team were eventual runners-up to Arsenal, though Dalla Bona did not play in the final. However, Dalla Bona turned down a contract extension, citing his desire to return to Italy, and was placed on the transfer list. Consequently, Dalla Bona fell out of favour and was forced to train with the reserves by Chelsea manager Claudio Ranieri. =A.C. Milan= Dalla Bona had decided to move back to his home nation of Italy. Numerous clubs were interested in the player, including his home town club Venezia who had a £5 million offer accepted but Dalla Bona decided his future lay elsewhere and turned down the opportunity. He moved to A.C. Milan for around £1 million in July 2002, having played 73 games for Chelsea in all competitions and scored 6 goals. Dalla Bona made his Serie A debut on 6 October 2002 as Milan defeated Torino 6–0. During his first season at Milan, he received Champions League and Coppa Italia winners medals along with the rest of the squad. Facing competition from a star-studded A.C. Milan midfield containing the likes of Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf and Andrea Pirlo, Dalla Bona's opportunities at the club were limited and he spent various seasons on loan at different clubs in Italy, the first of which was a year-long loan at Bologna. The following season he was loaned to Lecce having made just a handful of appearances for Milan and in 2005 he was loaned to Sampdoria for a season. =Napoli= At the end of the championship he returned to A.C. Milan but after a few weeks he transferred to Napoli then in the Italian Serie B league, on free transfer, despite still having a year left in his contract. Dalla Bona had a positive start at Napoli, with the club performing well in Serie B. His contributions to the team included a particularly stunning goal, a left footed volley from outside the box against Treviso. However, as Napoli made their return to Serie A, Dalla Bona was again regularly left out of the starting line, with Napoli signing new players. On 4 February 2009, Dalla Bona announced that he had left Napoli and was hoping to train with West Ham United to secure a permanent contract under former Chelsea teammate Gianfranco Zola. Dalla Bona announced he had rejected an offer from Serie B side Triestina because of this. He ultimately failed to secure a contact with West Ham and after another unsuccessful training spell with Fulham, he returned to Napoli. On 7 August 2009, Iraklis signed Dalla Bona on loan from Napoli for a season. However, he failed to adjust in the team, mainly due to lack of fitness and his contract was terminated in December 2009, after making just three appearances (all as a substitute) in competitive matches. On 1 February 2010 he was signed by third division side Verona. On 31 August 2010, he was loaned to Atalanta. However, Dalla Bona failed again to adjust to the team, and by the end of the season managed just a single appearance, in the Coppa Italia. =Mantova= On 31 August 2011, the final day of the summer transfer window, Dalla Bona signed a one-year contract for Mantova F.C.

Doctor of philology, she also wrote dramas, essays, studies, memoirs, poetry and children's literature. She is a founding member of the Digital Literary Academy. She is the most translated Hungarian author, with publications in 42 countries and over 30 languages.  Early life  Magda Szabó was born in Debrecen, Austria-Hungary in 1917. In 1940, she graduated from the University of Debrecen as a teacher of Latin and of Hungarian. She began teaching in the same year at the Protestant Girl's Boarding School in Debrecen and Hódmezővásárhely. From 1945 to 1949, she worked in the Ministry of Religion and Education. She married the writer and translator Tibor Szobotka (1913-1982) in 1947.  Writing career  Szabó began her writing career as a poet and published her first book of poetry, Bárány (\\"Lamb\\"), in 1947, which was followed by Vissza az emberig (\\"Back to the Human\\") in 1949. In 1949 she was awarded the Baumgarten Prize, which was immediately withdrawn when Szabó was labeled an enemy to the Communist Party. She was dismissed from the Ministry in the same year. The Stalinist era from 1949 to 1956 censored any literature, such as Szabó's work, that did not conform to socialist realism. Since her husband was also censored by the communist regime, she was forced to teach in a Calvinist girls' school until 1959. She wrote her first novel, Freskó (\\"Fresco\\") during these years, which was published in 1958. The novel tells the story of a puritan family coming together for a funeral, while examining questions of hypocrisy and reflecting on Hungarian history. In the same year, she published another book of poetry titled Bárány Boldizsár (\\"Lawrence the Lamb\\") and a novel written for a younger female audience titled Mondják meg Zsófikának (\\"Tell Young Sophie\\"). Az őz (\\"The Fawn\\") was published in 1959, a novel centered around an actress and her struggle to overcome a difficult, impoverished childhood. In this novel, Szabó effectively portrays the psychological, internal world of the modern woman. In 1961 and 1962, Szabó published two more novels for young women, Álarcosbál (\\"Masked Ball\\") and Születésnap (\\"Birthday\\") respectively. Pilátus (\\"Iza's Ballad\\"), the story of a female doctor and her relationship with her mother, was published in 1963. Tündér Lala (\\"Lara the Fairy\\"), her 1965 novel, is one of the most popular novels for children written in Hungarian. In 1969, she published Katalin utca (\\"Katalin Street\\"), a realistic depiction of post-World War II life. Her most widely read novel Abigél (\\"Abigail\\", 1970) is an adventure story about a young girl living in eastern Hungary during World War II. The novel's success resulted in a TV series, produced in 1978; the novel was also adapted into a musical that premiered in March 2008. In 1971, Szabó began a series of autobiographical works, which depict her family history. The first of this series is the short novel, Ókút (\\"The Ancient Well\\"), followed by Régimódi történet (\\"Old-Fashioned Story\\"). In 2002, Szabó continued this autobiographical series with Für Elise, a recollection of the author's life from 1917 to 1935. Today, this is one of her most popular works in Hungarian. In 1975, Szabó published a collection of plays titled Az órák és a farkasok (\\"The Wolf Hours\\"). She published two more dramas in 1984, Erőnk szerint (\\"According to Our Strength\\") and Béla Király (\\"King Béla\\"). Her novel Az ajtó (The Door) was published in 1987 and would become one of her most famous works worldwide. The novel revolves around the relationship between two women, one a prominent Hungarian writer much like Szabó herself, and the other her cryptic housekeeper. Claire Messud writes in the New York Times that reading The Door, has completely changed her outlook on life while Cynthia Zarin, contributor to The New Yorker, calls it \\"a bone-shaking book.\\" The Door was translated into English in 1995 by Stefan Draughon and again in 2005 by Len Rix.

Fighting took place over three days from 15 December to 17 December 1995. In 1998 the Permanent Court of Arbitration determined that most of the archipelago belonged to Yemen. Background The archipelago is on the southern side of the Red Sea near Bab-el-Mandeb (Mouth of the Red Sea). The Red Sea is about 60 miles (100 km) wide at this point. Since the British occupation of Aden, the islands had generally been regarded as part of Yemen. After being granted independence and membership of the United Nations, the new Eritrean government started negotiations with Yemen over the status of the archipelago. Two rounds of talks had taken place before the invasion: Greater Hanish (or Hanish al-Kabir) is one of three main islands in an archipelago, and until 1995, it was inhabited only by a handful of Yemeni fishermen. In 1995, a German company, under Yemeni auspices, began building a hotel and scuba diving centre on the Island. The Yemenis then sent a force of 200 men to guard the construction site. Eritrean officials thought that the construction work on Greater Hanish was an attempt to establish facts on the ground before the negotiations scheduled for February started. \\"Prompted by concern over the Yemeni construction project on Hanish al-Kabir, Eritrea's Foreign Minister Petros Solomon delivered, on 11 November 1995, an ultimatum giving San'a one month to withdraw Yemeni military forces and civilians from Hanish al-Kabir\\". quoted by Armed conflict When the Eritrean ultimatum ran out and the Yemeni military forces and civilians had not withdrawn, Eritrea launched an operation to take the island by force. The Eritreans used all seaworthy vessels that they had to land ground forces on the islands. Some Eritrean troops landed in fishing vessels and a commandeered Egyptian ferry. The Eritreans also used aircraft to ferry troops to the island. Eritrean forces attacked the Yemeni contingent and overran the entire island within three days of combat. During the fighting, a Russian merchant ship was damaged by Eritrean gunfire after it was mistaken for a Yemeni naval vessel. Alleged foreign involvement and other motives for the attack The Eritrean attack on the Hanish islands was said by Yemenis to be supported by Israel. According to Yemeni sources, the Eritrean operation may have been directed by Israeli officers. Sources close to the office of Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh claimed that \\"several Israelis\\" had directed the operation, including a lieutenant-colonel named as Michael Duma. This claim was based on several coded messages in Hebrew allegedly intercepted by Yemeni intelligence. Despite this, Yemen made no formal complaint to Israel. According to Steven Carol, in light of Yemeni military humiliation in the battle for Great Hanish island, the proposed allegation of Israeli involvement may have been nothing more than an attempt of Yemen to \\"save some face\\". In 1996, Brian Whitaker (1996) and Carol (2012) suggest that apart from the overt casus belli (that the war was initiated to establish facts on the ground), three other reasons had been proposed for the attack by the Eritreans on the island. The Yemeni opposition sources claimed that during 1994, Yemen received clandestine military assistance from Israel via the Eritreans, and the Eritreans took Hanish when Yemen failed to deliver the promised payments. Yemen's military claim, that it had intercepted radio messages in Hebrew and that \\"several Israelis\\" had helped to direct the Eritrean operation, led the Arab League to suggest that the real motive for the attack was that Israel intended to set up a base on the island. The third reason put forward was that there may be oil in the Red Sea and that the territorial rights to the seabed were the underlying reason for the war. Arbitration As no resolution to the problem could be reached in bilateral talks, the status of the archipelago was placed in front of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague in the Netherlands. The Permanent Court of Arbitration determined that most of the archipelago belonged to Yemen, while Eritrea was to retain the right to fish the waters around all the islands and sovereignty over some small islands close to Eritrea. On 1 November 1998 \\"Yemeni Defence Minister Mohammad Diefallah Mohammad raised his country's flag over the island of Greater Hanish as Yemeni army and navy troops took up positions on it. At the same time, Eritrean troops departed on board a helicopter and a naval vessel\\".

Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory volumes on the shelf at a law library History Martindale's Directory was first published in 1868 by James B. Martindale, a lawyer and business person. He wrote in the preface: > The object of the work is to furnish to Lawyers, Bankers, Wholesale > Merchants, Manufacturers, Real Estate Agents, and all others who may have > need of business correspondents away from home, the address of one reliable > law firm, one reliable bank, and one reliable real estate agent in each city > and town in the United States; also to give the laws of the several States > on subjects of a commercial character that are of interest or importance to > business men, or have a bearing on mercantile transactions and the > collection of debts.... > In view of constant and rapid changes occurring among Law firms, by reason > of death, retirement, election of office, dissolution, and an occasional > degeneracy, making the best list of necessity short-lived, and in view of > the continual changes being made in the commercial laws of the several > States, we will thoroughly revise this work once a year, and publish it > annually, on the first of every January.\\" In 1870, the first edition of Hubbell's Legal Directory was published. The introduction stated, \\"The vast and extending relations of business, the immense territory over which this business must be transacted, and the difficulties that often occur in obtaining reliable correspondents and information respecting the collection of debts in the different States, seem to create a necessity for a work of this character ...\\" By 1896, Martindale's Directory included basic information that still appears in today's Martindale- Hubbell Directory. This edition introduced law digests for all the states and provinces. The same year, the 26th edition of the Hubbell's Legal Directory was published. By combining the Martindale's Directory and Hubbell's Legal Directory, the first edition of the Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory was published in 1931 as a two-volume set. In 1951, a digest was added for Israel. Meanwhile, internal conditions as well as difficulties of communication with Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Rumania had made it necessary to withdraw publication of law digests for these countries. These law digests were revised and again published in the 1990s.

Space Odyssey premiered in 2004 and was made by the BBC. It was written and directed by Joe Ahearne and produced by Christopher Riley, who was presented with the 2005 Sir Arthur Clarke Award for Best TV & Radio Presentation. The story is set at an unspecified time in the future, though in the accompanying book, the mission's chief science officer recalls reading Arthur C. Clarke's 1982 novel, 2010, some 40 years earlier.Alex Lloyd: \\"I first read of a manned Jupiter mission in Arthur C. Clarke's novel 2010 when I was a boy; little did I know I'd be involved... some 40 years later.\\"  Story  Five astronauts pilot the nuclear thermal rocket powered Pegasus spacecraft on a tour of the Solar System. Their mission is a collaboration of the NASA, CSA, ESA and RКА space agencies and takes the crew to Venus, Mars, a close flyby of the Sun, Jupiter’s moons Io and Europa, Saturn, Pluto, and the fictional Comet Yano-Moore. Most of the planetary destinations the crew reaches are followed by a manned landing there. Prior to the mission large tanks of hydrogen were deposited in stable orbits around the planets to allow the crew to refuel to have sufficient delta-v for the multi- year mission. The crew encounter many hardships and disappointments along the way. A Venus EVA that almost ends in disaster when the lander Orpheus encounters launch delays, the near-loss of the shield during the aerobrake in Jupiter's upper atmosphere and the loss of samples from Jupiter's moon Io all test the crew's resolve. The most devastating blow comes when the ship's medical officer dies of solar radiation-induced lymphoma in Saturn orbit, forcing the crew to decide whether to continue the mission to Pluto, or abort and return to Earth. In the original British release, the crew decides to press on to Pluto, making history. The American version, broadcast on The Science Channel, was trimmed for length, the crew deciding to turn back at this stage rather than continue. The programme is narrated by David Suchet.

Production  The film had initially been titled Walking with Spacemen due to the involvement of Tim Haines, the creator of the Walking with Dinosaurs series. This title was eventually dropped as Space Odyssey had little in common with the Walking with . . . series. To prepare them for the roles, the actors undertook basic cosmonaut training at Star City with the Russian space program. Many scenes were shot in simulated zero-gravity aboard a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft. Backgrounds of the spacecraft interior were later digitally composited in. The series DVD describes the selection of locations in the Atacama Desert, Chile to represent both Venus and Mars. Weather conditions troubled production, needing to be overcast for Venus,Narrator: \\"Ideally, we needed a cloudy desert to film our Venus exploration scenes.\\" but cloudless for Mars.Associate Producer: \\"Another day on Mars... a bit of cloud, which we could have had for Venus, but didn't.\\" The fate of the Titan probe was deliberately ambiguous to prevent any conflicts with the findings of the then imminent landing of the Huygens probe. The film's score was written by American composer Don Davis, who wrote the music for the Matrix trilogy.  Tie-in book  BBC Books published a book written by Christopher Riley with the same title as the UK version of Space Odyssey. It was based on the fictional diary entries of the ground staff and crew on Pegasus, with supplementary factual information on the planets they visited and the real robotic missions which have explored them through history. It is illustrated with specially commissioned digital still images and screenshots taken from the drama.

The record is the band's second major label release for Columbia Records following their self-titled EP from the previous year. As would be characteristic of the band's music for their entire career, In Your Face contains a mix of ska, reggae, soul, punk and funk, but displayed very little influence in hard rock and heavy metal as the band would adopt in future records.Truth and Soul (1988) and The Reality of My Surroundings (1991) incorporated hard rock, and Give a Monkey a Brain... (1993) displayed heavy metal influences. Packaging The cover art of the original vinyl LP was designed to give the illusion that no certain side of the record was the front, back, up or down of the record. This was achieved by placing a barcode on both sides of the record and by printing the band and record name on all four sides of every edge of the record sleeve. Instead of an ordered track listing the tracks were listed haphazardly between both sides with each song title printed in a different contradictory direction. Finally, each side showed three of the six band members also oriented at opposite angles from each other. When someone handling the record saw where the record jacket opened they may have realized the two most likely correct orientations for the album cover. However the illusion was impaired by the inclusion of a parental advisory sticker on only one side of the record and the artwork of the CD version of the album which used the side with singer Angelo Moore on the cover and placed the entire track list on the opposite side. Promotion The band toured in support of the album with Murphy's Law and headliners Beastie Boys on the Licensed to Ill tour in February and March 1987.Hochman, Steve. \\"Fishbone LP Is Doing Swimmingly.\\" Billboard 27 Dec. 1986: 26.\\"Fishbone Concert Archive.\\" Fishbone Concert History.

Reception Fishbone's previous EP had done better than expected and expectations at Columbia Records were raised for In Your Face which led to radio support by CBS. However, Fishbone still had a considerable challenge reaching a larger audience within the American music industry which was still racially segregated during the 1980s and was not prepared to market to both black and white audiences. As a result, the album did not have sales significantly stronger than the Fishbone EP.Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone. Dir. Lev Anderson and Chris Metzler. Perf. Fishbone.

Parametric representation is a very general way to specify a surface, as well as implicit representation. Surfaces that occur in two of the main theorems of vector calculus, Stokes' theorem and the divergence theorem, are frequently given in a parametric form. The curvature and arc length of curves on the surface, surface area, differential geometric invariants such as the first and second fundamental forms, Gaussian, mean, and principal curvatures can all be computed from a given parametrization.  Examples  Torus, created with equations: ; ; . Parametric surface forming a trefoil knot, equation details in the attached source code. * The simplest type of parametric surfaces is given by the graphs of functions of two variables: :: z = f(x,y), \\\\quad \\\\vec r(x,y) = (x, y, f(x,y)). * A rational surface is a surface that admits parameterizations by a rational function. A rational surface is an algebraic surface. Given an algebraic surface, it is commonly easier to decide if it is rational than to compute its rational parameterization, if it exists. * Surfaces of revolution give another important class of surfaces that can be easily parametrized. If the graph z = f(x), a ≤ x ≤ b is rotated about the z-axis then the resulting surface has a parametrization :: \\\\vec r(u,\\\\phi) = (u\\\\cos\\\\phi, u\\\\sin\\\\phi, f(u)), \\\\quad a\\\\leq u\\\\leq b, 0\\\\leq\\\\phi < 2\\\\pi. :It may also be parameterized :: \\\\vec r(u,v) = \\\\left(u\\\\frac{1-v^2}{1+v^2}, u\\\\frac{2v}{1+v^2}, f(u)\\\\right), \\\\quad a\\\\leq u\\\\leq b, :showing that, if the function is rational, then the surface is rational. * The straight circular cylinder of radius R about x-axis has the following parametric representation: ::\\\\vec r(x, \\\\phi) = (x, R\\\\cos\\\\phi, R\\\\sin\\\\phi). * Using the spherical coordinates, the unit sphere can be parameterized by ::\\\\vec r(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = (\\\\cos\\\\theta \\\\sin\\\\phi, \\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\sin \\\\phi, \\\\cos\\\\phi), \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq \\\\theta < 2\\\\pi, 0 \\\\leq \\\\phi \\\\leq \\\\pi. : This parametrization breaks down at the north and south poles where the azimuth angle θ is not determined uniquely. The sphere is a rational surface. The same surface admits many different parametrizations. For example, the coordinate z-plane can be parametrized as :\\\\vec r(u,v)=(au+bv,cu+dv, 0) for any constants a, b, c, d such that ad − bc ≠ 0, i.e. the matrix \\\\begin{bmatrix}a & b c & d\\\\end{bmatrix} is invertible. Local differential geometry The local shape of a parametric surface can be analyzed by considering the Taylor expansion of the function that parametrizes it. The arc length of a curve on the surface and the surface area can be found using integration. = Notation = Let the parametric surface be given by the equation : \\\\vec{r}=\\\\vec{r}(u,v), where \\\\vec{r} is a vector-valued function of the parameters (u, v) and the parameters vary within a certain domain D in the parametric uv-plane. The first partial derivatives with respect to the parameters are usually denoted \\\\vec{r}_u := \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial u} and \\\\vec{r}_v, and similarly for the higher derivatives, \\\\vec{r}_{uu}, \\\\vec{r}_{uv}, \\\\vec{r}_{vv}. In vector calculus, the parameters are frequently denoted (s,t) and the partial derivatives are written out using the ∂-notation: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial s}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial t}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial s^2}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial s\\\\partial t}, \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\vec{r}}{\\\\partial t^2}. = Tangent plane and normal vector = The parametrization is regular for the given values of the parameters if the vectors : \\\\vec{r}_u, \\\\vec{r}_v are linearly independent. The tangent plane at a regular point is the affine plane in R3 spanned by these vectors and passing through the point r(u, v) on the surface determined by the parameters. Any tangent vector can be uniquely decomposed into a linear combination of \\\\vec{r}_u and \\\\vec{r}_v. The cross product of these vectors is a normal vector to the tangent plane. Dividing this vector by its length yields a unit normal vector to the parametrised surface at a regular point: : \\\\vec{n}=\\\\frac{\\\\vec{r}_u\\\\times\\\\vec{r}_v}{\\\\left\\\\vec{r}_u\\\\times\\\\vec{r}_v\\\\right}. In general, there are two choices of the unit normal vector to a surface at a given point, but for a regular parametrised surface, the preceding formula consistently picks one of them, and thus determines an orientation of the surface. Some of the differential-geometric invariants of a surface in R3 are defined by the surface itself and are independent of the orientation, while others change the sign if the orientation is reversed. =Surface area= The surface area can be calculated by integrating the length of the normal vector \\\\vec{r}_u\\\\times\\\\vec{r}_v to the surface over the appropriate region D in the parametric uv plane: : A(D) = \\\\iint_D\\\\left \\\\vec{r}_u\\\\times\\\\vec{r}_v\\\\right du dv. Although this formula provides a closed expression for the surface area, for all but very special surfaces this results in a complicated double integral, which is typically evaluated using a computer algebra system or approximated numerically. Fortunately, many common surfaces form exceptions, and their areas are explicitly known. This is true for a circular cylinder, sphere, cone, torus, and a few other surfaces of revolution. This can also be expressed as a surface integral over the scalar field 1: :\\\\int_S 1 \\\\,dS. =First fundamental form= The first fundamental form is a quadratic form : I = E\\\\,du^2 + 2\\\\,F\\\\,du\\\\,dv + G\\\\,dv^2 on the tangent plane to the surface which is used to calculate distances and angles. For a parametrized surface \\\\vec r=\\\\vec r(u,v), its coefficients can be computed as follows: : E=\\\\vec r_u\\\\cdot\\\\vec r_u, \\\\quad F=\\\\vec r_u\\\\cdot\\\\vec r_v, \\\\quad G=\\\\vec r_v\\\\cdot \\\\vec r_v. Arc length of parametrised curves on the surface S, the angle between curves on S, and the surface area all admit expressions in terms of the first fundamental form. If (u(t), v(t)), a ≤ t ≤ b represents a parametrised curve on this surface then its arc length can be calculated as the integral: : \\\\int_a^b \\\\sqrt{E\\\\,u'(t)^2 + 2F\\\\,u'(t)v'(t) + G\\\\,v'(t)^2}\\\\, dt. The first fundamental form may be viewed as a family of positive definite symmetric bilinear forms on the tangent plane at each point of the surface depending smoothly on the point. This perspective helps one calculate the angle between two curves on S intersecting at a given point. This angle is equal to the angle between the tangent vectors to the curves. The first fundamental form evaluated on this pair of vectors is their dot product, and the angle can be found from the standard formula : \\\\cos \\\\theta = \\\\frac{\\\\vec{a}\\\\cdot\\\\vec{b}}{\\\\left\\\\vec{a}\\\\right \\\\vec{b}} expressing the cosine of the angle via the dot product. Surface area can be expressed in terms of the first fundamental form as follows: : A(D) = \\\\iint_D \\\\sqrt{EG-F^2}\\\\, du\\\\,dv. By Lagrange's identity, the expression under the square root is precisely \\\\left\\\\vec{r}_u\\\\times\\\\vec{r}_v\\\\right^2, and so it is strictly positive at the regular points. =Second fundamental form= The second fundamental form : \\\\mathrm{II} = L \\\\, \\\\text{d}u^2 + 2M \\\\, \\\\text{d}u \\\\, \\\\text{d}v + N \\\\, \\\\text{d}v^2 is a quadratic form on the tangent plane to the surface that, together with the first fundamental form, determines the curvatures of curves on the surface. In the special case when (u, v) = (x, y) and the tangent plane to the surface at the given point is horizontal, the second fundamental form is essentially the quadratic part of the Taylor expansion of z as a function of x and y. For a general parametric surface, the definition is more complicated, but the second fundamental form depends only on the partial derivatives of order one and two. Its coefficients are defined to be the projections of the second partial derivatives of \\\\vec{r} onto the unit normal vector \\\\vec{n} defined by the parametrization: : L = \\\\vec r_{uu}\\\\cdot \\\\vec n, \\\\quad M = \\\\vec r_{uv}\\\\cdot \\\\vec n, \\\\quad N = \\\\vec r_{vv}\\\\cdot \\\\vec n. \\\\quad Like the first fundamental form, the second fundamental form may be viewed as a family of symmetric bilinear forms on the tangent plane at each point of the surface depending smoothly on the point. =Curvature= The first and second fundamental forms of a surface determine its important differential-geometric invariants: the Gaussian curvature, the mean curvature, and the principal curvatures. The principal curvatures are the invariants of the pair consisting of the second and first fundamental forms. They are the roots κ1, κ2 of the quadratic equation : \\\\det(\\\\mathrm{II}-\\\\kappa\\\\mathrm{I})=0, \\\\quad \\\\det\\\\left\\\\begin{matrix}L-\\\\kappa E & M-\\\\kappa F  M-\\\\kappa F & N-\\\\kappa G \\\\end{matrix}\\\\right = 0. The Gaussian curvature K = κ1κ2 and the mean curvature H = (κ1 \\\\+ κ2)/2 can be computed as follows: :K={LN-M^2\\\\over EG-F^2}, \\\\quad H={EN-2FM+GL\\\\over 2(EG-F^2)}. Up to a sign, these quantities are independent of the parametrization used, and hence form important tools for analysing the geometry of the surface. More precisely, the principal curvatures and the mean curvature change the sign if the orientation of the surface is reversed, and the Gaussian curvature is entirely independent of the parametrization. The sign of the Gaussian curvature at a point determines the shape of the surface near that point: for K > 0 the surface is locally convex and the point is called elliptic, while for K < 0 the surface is saddle shaped and the point is called hyperbolic. The points at which the Gaussian curvature is zero are called parabolic. In general, parabolic points form a curve on the surface called the parabolic line. The first fundamental form is positive definite, hence its determinant EG − F2 is positive everywhere. Therefore, the sign of K coincides with the sign of LN − M2, the determinant of the second fundamental. The coefficients of the first fundamental form presented above may be organized in a symmetric matrix: :F_1=\\\\begin{bmatrix}E & F F & G \\\\end{bmatrix}. And the same for the coefficients of the second fundamental form, also presented above: :F_2=\\\\begin{bmatrix}L & M M & N \\\\end{bmatrix}. Defining now matrix A = F_1^{-1} F_2 , the principal curvatures κ1 and κ2 are the eigenvalues of A.Surface curvatures Handouts, Principal Curvatures Now, if v1=(v11,v12) is the eigenvector of A corresponding to principal curvature κ1, the unit vector in the direction of \\\\vec t_1=v_{11} \\\\vec r_u + v_{12} \\\\vec r_v is called the principal vector corresponding to the principal curvature κ1. Accordingly, if v2=(v21,v22) is the eigenvector of A corresponding to principal curvature κ2, the unit vector in the direction of \\\\vec t_2=v_{21} \\\\vec r_u + v_{22} \\\\vec r_v is called the principal vector corresponding to the principal curvature κ2.

New England towns overlay the entire area of a state, similar to civil townships in other states where they exist, but they are fully functioning municipal corporations, possessing powers similar to cities in other states. New Jersey's system of equally powerful townships, boroughs, towns, and cities is the system which is most similar to that of New England. New England towns are often governed by a town meeting legislative body. The great majority of municipal corporations in New England are based on the town model; there, statutory forms based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon, though elsewhere in the U.S. they are prevalent. County government in New England states is typically weak at best, and in some states nonexistent. Connecticut, for example, has no county governments, nor does Rhode Island. Both of those states retain counties only as geographic subdivisions with no governmental authority, while Massachusetts has abolished eight of fourteen county governments so far. With few exceptions, counties serve mostly as dividing lines for the states' judicial systems.  Characteristics of the New England town system  Town hall of Plymouth, New Hampshire * Towns are laid out so that nearly all land within the boundaries of a state is allocated to a town or other corporate municipality. All land is incorporated into the bounds of a municipal corporation's territory, except in some very sparsely populated areas of the three northern New England states (primarily in the north). * Towns are municipal corporations, with their powers defined by a combination of municipal corporate charter, state statutes, and the state constitution. In most of New England, the laws regarding their authority have historically been very broadly construed. In practice, most New England towns have significant autonomy in managing their own affairs, with nearly all of the powers that cities typically have in most other U.S. states. New Hampshire and Vermont follow Dillon's Rule, which holds that local governments are largely creatures of the state. * Traditionally, a town's legislative body is the open town meeting, which is a form of direct democratic rule, with a board of selectmen possessing executive authority. Only several Swiss cantons with Landsgemeinde remain as democratic as the small New England town meetings. * A town almost always contains a built-up populated place (the \\"town center\\") with the same name as the town. Additional built-up places with different names are often found within towns, along with a mixture of additional urban and rural territory. Many (though not all) of these population centers have been designated by the U.S. Census Bureau as census designated places (CDP), which can be used by the Census Bureau for a separately named population center, or for an arbitrarily defined concentration of population within a town. *There is no territory that is not part of a town between each town; leaving one town means entering another town or other municipality. In most parts of New England, except Vermont and Maine, towns are irregular in shape and size and are not laid out on a grid. The town center often contains a town common or town green, often used today as a small park. * Virtually all residents live within the boundaries of a municipal corporation. Residents receive most local services at the municipal level, and county government tends to provide few or no services. Differences among states do exist in the level of services provided at the municipal and county level, but generally most functions normally handled by county-level government in the rest of the United States are handled by town-level government in New England. In Connecticut, Rhode Island, and most of Massachusetts, county government has been completely abolished, and counties serve merely as dividing lines for the judicial system. In other areas, some counties provide judicial and other limited administrative services. In many cases, the house numbers on rural roads in New England reset to zero upon crossing a town line. * Residents usually identify with their town for purposes of civic identity, thinking of the town in its entirety as a single, coherent community. There are some cases where residents identify more strongly with villages or sections of a town than with the town itself, particularly in Rhode Island, but this is the exception, not the rule. * More than 90% of the municipalities in the six New England states are identified as towns. Other forms of municipalities that exist are generally based on the town concept, as well—most notably cities. Most New England cities have adopted a city form of government, with a council and a mayor or manager. Municipal entities based on the concept of a compact populated place are uncommon, such as a Vermont village or Connecticut borough. In areas of New England where such forms do exist, they remain part of the parent town and do not have all of the corporate powers and authority of an independent municipality.  Historical development  Massachusetts town line sign, indicating the name of the town, the date of its establishment, and the seal of the state town green (Douglas, Massachusetts) Towns date back to the time of the earliest English colonial settlement, which predominated in New England, and they pre-date the development of counties in the region. Areas were organized as towns as they were settled, throughout the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Town boundaries were not usually laid out on any kind of regular grid, but were drawn to reflect local settlement and transportation patterns, often affected by natural features. In early colonial times, recognition of towns was very informal, generally connected to local church divisions. By 1700, colonial governments had become more involved in the official establishment of new towns. Towns were typically governed by a town meeting form of government, as many still are today. Towns originally were the only form of incorporated municipality in New England. The city form of government was not introduced until much later. Boston, for instance, was a town for the first two centuries of its existence. The entire land areas of Connecticut and Rhode Island had been divided into towns by the late 18th century, and Massachusetts was almost completely covered early in the 19th century. By 1850, the only New England state that still had large unincorporated areas was Maine; by the end of the 19th century, most areas in Maine that could realistically be settled had been organized into towns. Early town organization in Vermont and much of New Hampshire proceeded in a somewhat different manner from that of the other New England states. In these areas, towns were often \\"chartered\\" long before any settlers moved into a particular area. This was very common in the mid to late 18th century—although there were towns which predated that period and were not part of this process in southeastern New Hampshire, such as Exeter. Once there were enough residents in a town to formally organize a town government, no further action was necessary to incorporate. This practice can lead to inconsistencies in the dates of incorporation for towns in this region. Dates given in reference sources sometimes reflect the date when the town was chartered, which may have been long before it was settled, and not the date when its town government became active. In other parts of New England, some \\"future towns\\" were laid out along these lines, but such areas would not be formally incorporated as towns until they were sufficiently settled to organize a town government. A typical town in the northern three states was laid out in a square. Each contained 36 sections, squares or . One section was reserved for the support of public schools. This was copied when the Continental Congress laid out Ohio in 1785–87. Many early towns covered very large amounts of land. Once areas had become settled, new towns were sometimes formed by breaking areas away from the original existing towns. This was an especially common practice during the 18th and early 19th centuries. More heavily populated areas were often subdivided on multiple occasions. As a result, towns and cities in urbanized areas are often smaller in terms of land area than an average town in a rural area. Formation of new towns in this manner slowed in the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, however. It has not taken place anywhere in New England in the last fifty years; boundary changes of any type are fairly rare.  Other types of municipalities in New England  Towns are the basic building block of the New England municipality system, although several other types of municipalities also exist. Every New England state has cities. In addition, Maine also has a unique type of entity called a plantation. Beneath the town level, Connecticut has incorporated boroughs, and Vermont has incorporated villages. = Cities = In addition to towns, every New England state has incorporated cities. However, cities are treated in the same manner as towns under state law, differing from towns only in their form of government. Most cities are former towns that changed to a city form of government because they grew too large to have a town meeting as its legislative body; instead, a city's legislative body is an elected representative body, typically called the city council or town council or board of aldermen. City governments are typically administered by a mayor (and/or city manager). In common speech, people often generically refer to communities of either type as \\"towns\\", drawing no distinction between the two. The presence of incorporated boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont has influenced the evolution of cities in those states. In Connecticut in particular, the historical development of cities was quite different from in the other New England states, and at least technically, the relationship between towns and cities is today different from elsewhere in New England. Just as boroughs in Connecticut overlay towns, so do cities; for example, while Hartford is commonly thought of as a city, it is coextensive and consolidated with the Town of Hartford; governed by a single governmental entity with the powers and responsibilities of the Town being carried out by the entity referred to as the City of Hartford. In legal theory though not in current practice Connecticut cities and boroughs could be coextensive (covering the same geography as the town) without being consolidated (a single government); also a borough or city can span more than one town. In practice, though, most cities in Connecticut today do not function any differently from their counterparts elsewhere in New England. See the section below on boroughs and villages for more background on this topic. There are far fewer cities in New England than there are towns, although cities are more common in heavily built-up areas, and most of the largest municipalities in the region are titled as cities. Across New England as a whole, only about 5% of all incorporated municipalities are cities. Cities are more common in the three southern New England states, which are much more densely populated, than they are in the three northern New England states. In early colonial times, all incorporated municipalities in New England were towns; there were no cities. Springfield, Massachusetts, for instance, was settled as a \\"plantation\\" (in colonial Massachusetts, the term was synonymous with town) as early as 1636, but the city of Springfield was not established until 1852. The oldest cities in New England date to the last few decades of the 18th century, (e.g. New Haven, Connecticut was chartered as a city in 1784). In New England, cities were not widespread until well into the 19th century. New Hampshire did not have any cities until the 1840s, and for many years prior to the 1860s Vermont had just one city. Even Massachusetts, historically New England's most populous state, did not have any cities until 1822, when Boston was granted a city form of government by the state legislature. In most of New England, population is not a determining factor for what makes a city or town, and there are many examples of towns with larger populations than nearby cities. Massachusetts is one of the few states in the region that is an exception to this rule; the Massachusetts Constitution requires a town to have a population of at least 10,000 people before it can switch its government from a town meeting form to a city form. Nevertheless, even without a hard and fast population limit for city status, the practical threshold to become a city seems to be higher in the three southern New England states than in the three northern New England states. In Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, almost every city has at least 10,000 people, and all but a few have at least 20,000. In Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, however, there are a number of cities with fewer than 10,000 people, and there are five (three in Maine and two in Vermont) with fewer than 5,000. Over time, some of the distinctions between a town and a city have become blurred. Since the early 20th century, towns have been allowed to modify the town meeting form of government in various ways (e.g., representative town meeting, adding a town manager). In recent decades, some towns have adopted what effectively amount to city forms of government, although they still refer to themselves as towns. As a practical matter, one municipality that calls itself a town and another that calls itself a city may have exactly the same governmental structure. With these changes in town government, a reluctance to adopt the title of city seems to have developed, and few towns have officially done so since the early 20th century. In Massachusetts, 13 municipalities (Agawam, Amesbury, Barnstable, Braintree, Easthampton, Franklin, Greenfield, Palmer, Randolph, Southbridge, Watertown, West Springfield and Weymouth) have adopted Mayor- Council or Council-Manager forms of government in their home rule charters, and are therefore considered to be legally cities, but nevertheless continue to call themselves \\"towns\\". They are sometimes referred to in legislation and other legal documents as \\"the city known as the Town of ...\\" Greenfield, in December 2017, dropped the \\"town\\" designation, which some called \\"embarrassing\\" and which legislators said made paperwork more difficult.Andrew Varnon, \\"What's Taken Greenfield, Mass., So Long To Stop Calling Itself A Town?\\", NEPR.net, Jan. 26, 2018. Common parlance labeling a community a \\"city\\" or a \\"town\\" may have more to do with its current size, whether its current size or its historical size and reputation. = Plantations = In addition to towns and cities, Maine has a third type of town-like municipality not found in any other New England state, the plantation. A plantation is, in essence, a town-like community that does not have enough population to require full town government or services. Plantations are organized at the county level, and are typically found in sparsely populated areas. There is no bright-line population divider between a town and a plantation, but no plantation currently has any more than about 300 residents. Plantations are considered to be \\"organized\\" but not \\"incorporated.\\" Not all counties have them; in some southern counties, all territory is sufficiently populated to be covered by a town or a city. In colonial times, Massachusetts also used the term \\"plantation\\" for a community in a pre-town stage of development (Maine originally got the term from Massachusetts, as Maine was part of Massachusetts until 1820, when it became a state via the Missouri Compromise). The term plantation had not been much used in Massachusetts since the 18th century. Massachusetts also once had \\"districts,\\" which served much the same purpose. They were considered to be incorporated, but lacked the full privileges of a town. On August 23, 1775 in order for more representation for the Revolutionary War, 36 towns in Massachusetts and 6 in Maine were incorporated, effectively eliminating the district meaning. Maine and Rhode Island are also known to have made limited use of the district concept. Districts have not been at all common since the first half of the 19th century, and there have not been any districts anywhere in New England in over a century. Maine is the only New England state that currently has a significant amount of territory that is not sufficiently populated to support town governments, thus the only New England state that still has a need for the plantation type of municipality. For a historical example in New Hampshire, see Plantation number four. = Boroughs and villages = Most areas of New England never developed municipal forms based on the compact populated place concept. This contrasts with states with civil townships, which typically have extensive networks of villages or boroughs that carve out or overlay the townships. Two of the New England states do have general-purpose municipalities of this type, however, to at least a limited extent. Connecticut has incorporated boroughs, and Vermont has incorporated villages. Such areas remain a part of their parent town, but assume some responsibilities for municipal services within their boundaries. In both states, they are typically regarded as less important than towns, and both seem to be in decline as institutions. In recent decades, many boroughs and villages have disincorporated, reverting to full town control. The term \\"village\\" is sometimes used in New England to describe a distinct, built-up place within a town or city. This may be a town center, which bears the same name as the town or city (almost every town has such a place), or a name related to that of the town, or a completely unrelated name. The town of Barnstable, Massachusetts, for example, includes the villages of Barnstable Village, West Barnstable, Centerville, Marstons Mills, Osterville, Cotuit, and Hyannis. Except for the incorporated villages in Vermont, these \\"villages\\" are not incorporated municipalities and should not be understood as such. Towns do sometimes grant a certain measure of recognition to such areas, using highway signs that identify them as \\"villages\\", for example. These informal \\"villages\\" also sometimes correspond to underlying special-purpose districts such as fire or water districts, which are separately incorporated quasi-municipal entities that provide specific services within a part of a town. (In Maine and New Hampshire, the term \\"village corporation\\" is used for a type of special- purpose district.) Many villages also are recognized as places by the United States Postal Service (some villages have their own post offices, with their names used in mailing addresses) or the United States Census Bureau (which recognizes some villages as census-designated places and tabulates census data for them). Towns with an example of the former, such as Richmond, Rhode Island, do not have a post office themselves, but instead use villages in town or villages in nearby towns as a mailing address. This leads to a weaker town identification in such towns, with residents more strongly identifying with the village they live in. However, villages or CDPs have no existence as general-purpose municipalities separate from the town (if they even have any legal existence at all), and are usually regarded by local residents as a part of the town in which they are located, less important than the whole. It is possible for a Connecticut borough or Vermont village to become a city. In Connecticut, cities overlay towns just as boroughs do, and, just like a borough, a city can cover only a portion of a town rather than being coextensive with the town. This is rare today—only one or two examples remain—but it was more common in the past. At least one borough historically spanned more than one town: the borough of Danielsonville originally laid over parts of Killingly and Brooklyn, until the Brooklyn portion petitioned to be reorganized as a fire district and concurrently the Killingly portion was renamed Danielson by the General Assembly. There are no legal restrictions in Connecticut that would prevent a city or borough today from similarly overlaying the territory of more than one town, provided it is not consolidated with one of the underlying towns. Cities actually developed earlier in Connecticut than in the other New England states, and were originally based on the borough concept. At one time, all cities were non- coextensive; the practice of making cities coextensive with their towns was a later adaptation intended to mimic the city concept that had emerged in the other New England states. Over time, many non-coextensive cities have expanded to become coextensive with their parent town. As with boroughs, many have also disincorporated and reverted to full town control. These two trends have combined to make non-coextensive cities very rare in recent times. In Vermont, if a village becomes a city, it does not continue to overlay its parent town, but breaks away and becomes a completely separate municipality. Most cities in Vermont today are actually former villages rather than former towns, and are much smaller than a typical town in terms of land area. The above process has created several instances where there are adjacent towns and cities with the same name. In all cases, the city was originally the \\"town center\\" of the town, but later incorporated as a city and became a separate municipality.  Unorganized territory  All three of the northern New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation. Maine has significantly more such area than the other two states. While these areas do exist, their importance should not be overstated. They are certainly the exception rather than the rule in the New England system, and the number of New England residents who live in them is extremely small in comparison to those who live in towns and cities, even in Maine. Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example. The majority of the unincorporated areas in New Hampshire are in Coos County, and the majority of the unincorporated areas in Vermont are in Essex County. Two additional counties in New Hampshire and three additional counties in Vermont contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. In Maine, eight of the state's sixteen counties contain significant amounts of unorganized territory (in essence, those counties in the northern and interior parts of the state). Four other counties contain smaller amounts. Most of these areas have no local government at all; indeed, some have no permanent population whatsoever. Some areas have a very rudimentary organization that does not rise to the level of an organized general-purpose municipal government (e.g., a town clerk’s office exists for the purpose of conducting elections for state or federal offices). In general, unorganized areas fall into one of the three categories below. = Gores and similar entities = During the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, as town boundaries were being drawn up, small areas would sometimes be left over, not included in any town. Typically smaller than a normal-sized town, these areas were known by a variety of names, including gores, grants, locations, purchases, surpluses, and strips. Sometimes these areas were not included in any town due to survey errors (which is the technical meaning of the term “gore”). Sometimes they represent small areas that were left over when a particular region was carved into towns, not large enough to be a town on their own. Some appear to have simply been granted outside the usual town structure, sometimes in areas where it was probably not contemplated that towns would ever develop. Over time, those located in more populated areas were, in general, annexed to neighboring towns, or incorporated as towns in their own right. No such areas exist today in Massachusetts, Connecticut or Rhode Island, but some remain in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine. * New Hampshire: Coos County contains a total of seventeen grants, purchases and locations. Together, these cover a significant amount of land area, but had only 61 residents as of the 2000 Census (44 of whom lived in a single entity, Wentworth's Location). The only remaining unincorporated gore-like entity outside of Coos County is Hale’s Location, in neighboring Carroll County, a tract, which has reported population in only three censuses since 1900. (Note that Hart's Location, also in Carroll County, has been incorporated since 1795, although it continues to carry the word “location\\" in its name. Wentworth's Location was similarly incorporated as a town at one time.) * Vermont: Essex County contains three gores and grants. Together, they cover about , and reported 10 residents in the 2000 Census. The only remaining unincorporated gore-like entity outside of Essex County is Buel's Gore, in Chittenden County, a tract, which reported 30 residents in 2010. Up until the 1960s or 1970s, Franklin County contained a gore as well, which was ultimately eliminated by dividing it between two neighboring towns. * Maine: the interior of the state contains a number of entities of this type. There are a few remaining in more populated areas of the state as well. Examples include Hibberts Gore, in Lincoln County, and Batchelders Grant, in southern Oxford County. = Unorganized townships = All three of the northern New England states contain some town-sized unorganized entities, referred to as \\"unorganized townships\\" (sometimes, just \\"townships\\") or \\"unorganized towns\\". Most of these are areas that were drawn up on maps in the 18th and 19th centuries as what might be termed “future towns”, but never saw enough settlement to actually commence operation of a formal town government. * New Hampshire: Coös County contains six unorganized townships that do not appear to have ever been actively incorporated. Their collective population in the 2000 Census was 114, most of whom lived in one of two townships (Dixville and Millsfield). There are no other unorganized townships in the state that have never been incorporated. * Vermont: Essex County contains three unorganized townships that do not appear to have ever been actively incorporated. Their collective population in the 2000 Census was 41. There are no other unorganized townships in the state that have never been incorporated. * Maine: the interior of Maine contains hundreds of unorganized townships, most of which have never been incorporated or organized. Much of the interior of Maine is divided into surveyed townships that are identified only by letters and numbers that indicate their position on a grid. These were probably never seriously intended to ever become towns. = Disincorporated towns = All three of the northern New England states also include at least one unorganized township that was once a town, but has disincorporated and reverted to unorganized territory, generally due to population loss. Maine also has some unorganized townships that were once organized as plantations. * New Hampshire: The town of Livermore, located in a mountainous area of Grafton County, disincorporated in 1951. Livermore reported no population in its final census as an incorporated town (1950), and has reported no more than three residents in any census since then. Most of its territory is now part of White Mountain National Forest. Since it was once incorporated as a town, Wentworth's Location could also be put into this category as well. Wentworth's Location disincorporated in 1966; its population in the 1970 Census was 37. The town of Gosport was established on the Isles of Shoals in 1715, but the population was evacuated during the American Revolutionary War, and the isles were largely abandoned until the mid-19th century. The New Hampshire islands are now part of the town of Rye. * Vermont: The towns of Glastenbury and Somerset, located in the Green Mountains on opposite sides of the Bennington- Windham County line, disincorporated in 1937. In the 1940 Census, Glastenbury reported five residents, Somerset four. In only one census since then has the population of either reached double digits. * Maine: Dozens of towns and plantations have surrendered their municipal organization over the years and reverted to unorganized territory. An especially large number of municipal dissolutions took place between 1935 and 1945, but some have also occurred before and after that time period. Recent town disincorporations include Centerville (2004), Madrid (2000) and Greenfield (1993). The most recent plantations to surrender their organization were Prentiss Plantation and E Plantation, both in 1990. * Massachusetts: The towns of Dana, Prescott, Greenwich and Enfield were disincorporated in 1938 to make way for the Quabbin Reservoir. Their territory was divided up between the neighboring towns, and did not produce newly unincorporated land. In the 1860s to the early 1910s, many towns around Boston became annexed to the city. These towns included Dorchester, Roxbury, Charlestown, Brighton, Hyde Park, and West Roxbury. In addition, Bradford was annexed into Haverhill in 1897. Maine has significantly more unorganized territory than Vermont or New Hampshire. Fewer than 100 Vermont residents and fewer than 250 New Hampshire residents live in unorganized areas. In Maine, by contrast, about 10,000 residents live in unorganized areas. As a result, Maine has developed more of an infrastructure for administration of unincorporated and unorganized areas than the other New England states. The existence of this fallback probably explains why Maine has had significantly more towns disincorporated over the years than any other New England state. There have been numerous instances of towns in Maine disincorporating despite populations that numbered in the hundreds. While these were not large communities, they were large enough to realistically operate a town government if they wanted to, but simply elected not to. In Vermont and New Hampshire, disincorporation has, in general, not been brought up for discussion unless a town's population has approached single digits. = Coastal waters = In general, coastal waters in the New England states are administered directly by either state or federal agencies and are not part of any town. Several towns, however, have chosen to include all or part of their corresponding coastal waters in their territory. Coastal waters include man- made structures built within them. In Connecticut, for example, an artificial, uninhabited island in Long Island Sound at the boundary with New York State, housing the Stratford Shoal Light, is not part of any town and is administered directly by the United States Coast Guard. In general, inhabited minor off- shore islands are administered as part of a nearby town, and, in some cases, are their own independent towns, such as the town of Gosnold, in Massachusetts, which encompasses the Elizabeth Islands.  Census treatment of the New England town system  = Towns = Unlike municipalities in most other states, the United States Census Bureau does not classify New England towns as \\"incorporated places\\". They are instead classified as \\"minor civil divisions\\" (MCDs), the same category into which civil townships fall. The Census Bureau classifies New England towns in this manner because they are conceptually similar to civil townships from a geographic standpoint, typically exhibiting like population-distribution patterns. Like civil townships, but unlike most incorporated municipalities in other states, New England towns do not usually represent a single compact populated place. Plantations in Maine are similarly classified as MCDs. That New England towns serve, in essence, the same function as incorporated places in other states, but are not treated as incorporated places by the Census Bureau, can be a source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that New England towns are not incorporated, or necessarily serve a similar purpose to MCDs in other states in terms of governmental function or civic-identity importance. New England towns are classified as MCDs not because they are not \\"incorporated\\" but rather the data that the census gathers on places is analyzed based on different models (those of compact settled places and open rural places) that is not well represented by the New England Town system of organization. In order to better fit their own purposes, the Census only counts cities and certain fully urbanized towns as \\"places\\" in its categorization. In other towns, those with small built-up central villages, the Census designates one or more census-designated places (CDPs) and considers all other land to be parts of \\"minor civil divisions\\". This classification is done only for the Census's own data analysis, and otherwise has no connection to the actual organization or legal status of New England towns. The census bureau does uniquely recognize towns, however, in that it classifies metropolitan areas in New England on the basis of town boundaries rather than county boundaries as it does in other parts of the U.S. Unique to New England is the New England city and town area, which is analogous to Metropolitan Statistical Areas in other parts of the U.S., except that it uses the town as its basic unit rather than the county. = Cities = Even though the Census Bureau does not treat New England towns as \\"incorporated places\\", it does classify cities in New England as such. The rationale behind this is that cities are likely to be more thoroughly built-up and therefore more readily comparable to cities in other states than towns are. Boroughs in Connecticut and incorporated villages in Vermont are also treated as incorporated places. That New England states, in general, regard cities and towns on equal footing, yet they are handled in two different ways by the Census Bureau, can be another source of confusion. The Census classifications should not be understood to imply that cities are incorporated but towns are not, or that cities and towns represent two fundamentally different types of entities. Note that the Census classifies New England municipalities strictly based on whether they are towns or cities, with no regard to the actual population-distribution pattern in a particular municipality. All municipalities titled as cities are classified as incorporated places, even if their population-distribution pattern is no different from that of a typical town; towns are never classified as incorporated places, even if they are thoroughly built-up. The ambiguity over whether certain municipalities in Massachusetts should be classified as cities or towns, and the Census Bureau's inconsistent handling of these municipalities (see the Statistics and Superlatives section below), further blurs matters. = Census-designated places = To fill in some of the \\"place\\" data, the Census Bureau sometimes recognizes census-designated places (CDPs) within New England towns. These often correspond to town centers or other villages, although not all such areas are recognized as CDPs. In cases where a town is entirely or almost entirely built-up, the Census sometimes recognizes a CDP which is coextensive with the entire town. CDPs are only recognized within towns, not cities. Because the primary role of CDPs is to establish \\"place\\" data for communities located in unincorporated areas, a CDP cannot be within an incorporated place. Since the Census Bureau recognizes New England cities as incorporated places, a CDP cannot be within a city. Data users from outside New England should be aware that New Englanders usually think in terms of entire towns (i.e., MCD data), making CDP data of marginal local interest. Since virtually all territory in New England outside of Maine is incorporated, CDPs do not really serve the same purpose as they do elsewhere; CDPs in New England invariably represent territory that is not \\"unincorporated\\", but part of a larger incorporated town. The extent to which such an area has its own distinct identity can vary, but is not usually as strong as identification with the town as a whole. There are numerous instances where the Census Bureau recognizes the built-up area around a town center as a CDP, resulting in a CDP that bears the same name as the town. In these cases, data for the CDP is, in general, meaningless to local residents, who seldom draw any particular distinction between the built-up area around the town center and outlying areas of the town. A local source citing data for such a community will almost always use the data for the entire town, not the CDP. At the same time, not all built-up places of significant population are recognized as CDPs. The Census Bureau has historically recognized relatively few CDPs within urbanized areas in particular. Many towns located in such areas do not contain any recognized CDPs, and will thus be completely absent from Census materials presenting population of \\"places\\". Greenwich, Connecticut is one prominent example. While the Town of Greenwich appears in MCD materials, the Census Bureau does not recognize Greenwich as a \\"place\\". = Unorganized areas = In New Hampshire and Vermont, the Census Bureau treats each individual unorganized entity (township, gore, grant, etc.) as an MCD. In Maine, it seems, due to the extent of unorganized area, the Census Bureau typically lumps contiguous townships, gores, and the like together into larger units called \\"unorganized territories\\" (UTs), which are then treated as MCDs. In a few cases in Maine where a township or gore does not border any other unorganized land, it is treated as its own MCD rather than being folded into a larger UT. In theory, a CDP could probably be defined within an MCD representing an unorganized area. Due to the extremely sparse population in most such areas, however, there are few if any cases in which the Census Bureau has actually done so.  List of New England towns  For a list of all New England towns and other town-level municipalities, see List of New England towns. That page also includes links to historical census population statistics for New England towns.  Statistics  Note: all population statistics are from the 2010 United States Census. = Connecticut = Connecticut contains 169 incorporated towns. Put into terms that are equivalent to the other New England states, 20 are cities/boroughs and 149 are towns. (As discussed in the Cities section of Other types of municipalities in New England above, the relationship between towns and cities in Connecticut is different from the other New England states, at least on paper; thus, in the technical sense, all 169 of the above municipalities are really towns, with 20 overlaid by a coextensive city or borough of the same name.) Together, these 169 municipalities cover the entire state. There is no unincorporated territory, but, as in all New England states, there are a fair number of unincorporated, named communities that lie within the incorporated territory of a municipality. Connecticut is one of two New England states to have any type of incorporated general-purpose municipality below the town level, namely incorporated boroughs (Vermont has incorporated villages). There are nine remaining in the state. They were once more numerous.R.A. Ferry, \\"A short directory of the names, past and current of Connecticut boroughs\\", (Connecticut Ancestry Society, 1996) Many of those that remain are very small. Connecticut also has at least one remaining city (Groton) that is within, but not coextensive with, its parent town. A second non-coextensive city, Winsted, still exists on paper, but its government has been consolidated with that of the town of Winchester for many years, making it more of a special-purpose district than a true municipality. Winsted is no longer recognized by the Census Bureau as an incorporated place, although data is tabulated for a Census Designated Place that is coextensive with that of the original city. * The largest municipality in Connecticut, by population, is the city of Bridgeport (pop. 144,229). * The largest that is a town and not a city is West Hartford (pop. 63,268). * The smallest that is a city and not a town, only including cities that are coextensive with their towns, is Derby (pop. 12,902), density 2,507/sq mi. The city-within-a-town of Groton, however, is smaller (pop. 10,389), and to the extent that Winsted is recognized as a non- coextensive city, it is even smaller than Groton is (pop. 7,712). * The smallest town is Union (pop. 854). * The largest municipality by land area is the town of New Milford (). * The smallest town-level municipality is Derby (). = Maine = 2010 Maine population density map Maine contains 488 organized municipalities of which 23 are incorporated as cities, 431 are incorporated as towns, and the remaining 34 are organized as plantations. These 488 organized municipalities together cover much of, but not all of, the state's territory. Of Maine's sixteen counties, only four are entirely incorporated. Four other counties are almost entirely incorporated, but include small amounts of unincorporated/unorganized territory (three of these four counties were entirely incorporated or organized at one time, but lost that status when a town disincorporated or a plantation surrendered its organization). The remaining eight counties contain significant amounts of unincorporated/unorganized territory. Most of these areas are in very sparsely populated regions, however. Only about 1.3% of the state's population lives in areas not part of a town, city, or plantation. (Since the 2000 Census, two towns, Madrid and Centerville, have disincorporated. Thus, at the time of the 2000 Census, Maine had 22 cities, 434 towns, and 34 plantations, for a total of 490 organized municipalities. Also since the 2010 Census, Sanford adopted a new charter that included designation as a city.) * The largest municipality in Maine, by population, is the city of Portland (pop. 66,194). * The largest that is a town and not a city is Brunswick (pop. 20,278). * The smallest that is a city and not a town is Eastport (pop. 1,331). * The smallest town is Frye Island, a resort town that reported a year-round population of five in the 2010 Census. * The smallest town aside from Frye Island is Beddington (pop. 50). (At the time of the 2000 Census, the smallest town aside from Frye Island was Centerville (pop. 26), but Centerville disincorporated in 2004.) * The largest municipality by land area is the town of Allagash (). * The smallest is the island plantation of Monhegan (). = Massachusetts = Massachusetts cities and towns. All territory of the state is within the bounds of a municipal corporation. Massachusetts contains 351 municipal corporations, consisting of cities and towns. These 351 municipalities together encompass the entire territory of Massachusetts; there is no area that is outside the bounds of a municipality. Using usual American terminology, there is no \\"unincorporated\\" land in Massachusetts. Of the 351 municipalities, the number that are cities and the number that are towns is a matter of some ambiguity. Depending on which source is consulted, anywhere from 39 to 53 are cities. The ambiguity is the result of questions around the legal status of municipalities that have since the 1970s, through home-rule petition, adopted corporate charters approved by the state legislature with forms of government that resemble city government and do not include elements traditionally associated with town government (especially, a board of selectmen and a town meeting). Of the fourteen communities that have done so, all but three call themselves a \\"town\\" in their municipal operations, and are usually referred to by residents as \\"towns\\", but the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office considers all fourteen to be legally cities. Other sources within state government often refer to all fourteen municipalities as towns, however. The U.S. Census Bureau listed all as towns through the 1990 Census. For the 2000 Census, some were listed by the Federal government as towns and some as cities, a situation that continues in Census materials since 2000. Massachusetts appears to be the only New England state where this issue has arisen, though other New England states also have municipalities that have adopted what amounts to city forms of government but continue to call themselves \\"towns\\". In the other New England states, it does not appear that any need to officially label such municipalities as \\"cities\\" has been identified. For purposes of determining the \\"largest town\\", \\"smallest city\\", in this article, only the 42 municipalities that title themselves as cities are recognized as cities. This includes the 39 cities that adopted city forms of government through pre-home rule procedures. The other 309 municipalities in the state are treated as towns below. The same classification is used for identifying Massachusetts cities on the list of New England towns and its attendant pages with historical census population statistics. For further information, see this section of Massachusetts government. Massachusetts Department of Housing and Community Development. Massachusetts communities operating under home rule charters (prepared and adopted under provisions of the Home Rule Amendment and M.G.L., c. 43B) Massachusetts Cities and Towns Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Retrieved January 14, 2007. As of 2005, the Massachusetts state government specifically identifies eleven municipalities as cities that call themselves \\"Town of ____\\". Those municipalities are: Agawam, Amesbury, Barnstable, Easthampton, Franklin, Greenfield, Methuen, Southbridge, Watertown, West Springfield, and Weymouth. See also Secretary of the Commonwealth: A Listing of Counties and the Cities and Towns Within, which indicates that there are 301 towns and 50 cities, and again specifying the eleven cities that call themselves \\"Town of ___\\" and which also indicates that the courts recognize the city attribution for those eleven municipalities. Of these, Easthampton, Greenfield, and Methuen as of 2009 call themselves as cities, and since 2005, the municipalities of Braintree, Palmer, and Winthrop have adopted city forms of government. * The largest municipality in Massachusetts by population is the city of Boston (pop. 617,594). * The smallest that is a city and not a town is Palmer (pop. 12,140). * The largest that is a town and not a city is Brookline (pop. 58,732). * The smallest overall is the town of Gosnold (pop. 75). * The largest municipality by land area is the town of Plymouth (). * The smallest town by area is the town of Nahant (). = New Hampshire = Map of New Hampshire municipalities New Hampshire contains 234 incorporated towns and cities. Thirteen are cities and 221 are towns. These 234 municipalities together cover the vast majority of, but not all of, the state's territory. There are some unincorporated areas in the sparsely populated northern region of the state. Most of the unincorporated areas are in Coos County, the state's northernmost county. Carroll and Grafton counties also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. This territory includes seven unincorporated townships and an assortment of gores, grants, purchases, and locations. The remaining seven counties in the state are entirely incorporated (Grafton County was also fully incorporated at one time, but lost that status when one of its towns disincorporated). Fewer than 250 of the state's residents live in unincorporated areas. * The largest municipality in New Hampshire, by population, is the city of Manchester (pop. 109,565). * The largest that is a town and not a city is Derry (pop. 33,109). * The smallest that is a city and not a town is Franklin (pop. 8,477). * The smallest incorporated municipality overall is the town of Hart's Location (pop. 41), which, despite its name, is an incorporated town. * The largest municipality by land area is the town of Pittsburg (). * The smallest is the town of New Castle (). = Rhode Island = Cities and towns of Rhode Island Rhode Island contains 39 incorporated towns and cities. Eight are cities and 31 are towns. These 39 municipalities together cover the entire state; there is no unincorporated territory. * The largest municipality in Rhode Island, by population, is the city of Providence (pop. 178,042). * The largest that is a town and not a city is Coventry (pop. 35,014). * The smallest that is a city and not a town is Central Falls (pop. 19,376). * The smallest overall is the town of New Shoreham (pop. 1,051). * The largest municipality by land area is Coventry (). * The smallest is Central Falls (). = Vermont = Vermont contains 246 incorporated towns and cities, which together cover nearly all of the state's territory. Nine are cities and 237 are towns. There are some unincorporated areas in the sparsely populated mountainous regions of the state. Most of the unincorporated areas are in Essex County, in the northeastern part of the state. Bennington, Windham and Chittenden counties also contain smaller amounts of unincorporated territory. This territory includes five unincorporated townships and a handful of gores and grants. The remaining ten counties in the state are entirely incorporated (Bennington and Windham counties were also fully incorporated at one time, but lost that status when a town disincorporated). Fewer than 100 of the state's residents live in unincorporated areas. Vermont is one of two New England states to have any type of incorporated general-purpose municipality below the town level, namely incorporated villages (Connecticut has incorporated boroughs). There are about 40 in the state. There were once nearly double that number. Most of those that remain are very small. * The largest municipality in Vermont, by population, is the city of Burlington (pop. 42,417). * The largest which is a town and not a city is Essex (pop. 19,587). * The smallest which is a city and not a town is Vergennes (pop. 2,588). * The smallest incorporated town is Victory (pop. 62). * The largest municipality by land area is the town of Chittenden (). * The smallest town- level municipality is the city of Winooski ().

History The garden, 5.5 acres in size, was once a prune orchard, but was bought by San Jose in 1927. The garden was founded on 20 November 1927, when San Jose City Council set aside 5 1/2 acres of an 11–acre tract of land for a rose garden. Its creation had been championed by the Santa Clara County Rose Society, which subsequently provided the roses for the new land given by the city. Groundbreaking took place on On 7 April 1931 and the Municipal Rose Garden was officially dedicated on 7 April 1937, six years later.City of San José - Municipal Rose Garden As an official Display Garden for the All-America Rose Selections (AARS), the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden receives AARS award-winning roses in advance of public release. Awards In the early 2000s, city budget cuts impacted the garden, which led to the AARS placing it on probation. In 2007 Friends of the San Jose Rose Garden (FSJRG) was established, a volunteer nonprofit organization whose mission was to restore and renovate the garden. In 2008 the AARS lifted the garden from probation and restored full accreditation, and the following year over 800 new roses were planted as part of the restoration project.

It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir found between Giza and Saqqara and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.  Location and excavation  alt=Painting of pyramids and temples in Abusir The Pyramid of Neferirkare is situated on the necropolis at Abusir, between Saqqara and the Giza Plateau. Abusir assumed great import in the Fifth Dynasty after Userkaf, the first ruler, built his sun temple and, his successor, Sahure inaugurated a royal necropolis there with his funerary monument. Sahure's successor, his son Neferirkare, was the second ruler to be entombed in the necropolis. The Egyptologist Jaromír Krejčí proposes a number of hypotheses for the position of Neferirkare's complex in relation to Sahure's complex: (1) that Neferirkare was motivated to distance himself from Sahure and thus chose to found a new cemetery and redesign the mortuary temple plan to differentiate it from Sahure's; (2) that geomorphological pressures particularly the slope between Neferirkare's and Sahure's complexes required Neferirkare to situate his complex elsewhere; (3) on the basis of the site being the highest point, Neferirkare may have selected it to ensure his complex dominated the surrounding area and; (4) that the site may have been intentionally selected to build the pyramid in line with Heliopolis. The Abusir diagonal is a figurative line connecting the north-west corners of the pyramids of Neferirkare, Sahure and Neferefre. It is similar to the Giza axis, which connects the south-east corners of the Giza pyramids, and converges with the Abusir diagonal to a point in Heliopolis. Neferirkare's pyramid with original step pyramid clearly visible underneath the rubble exterior The location of the complex impacted the construction process. The Egyptologist Miroslav Bárta states that one of the major factors influencing the location was their position in relation to the administrative capital of the Old Kingdom, Inbu-Hedj known today as Memphis. Providing that the location of ancient Memphis is accurately known, the Abusir necropolis would have been no further than from the city centre. The benefit of the site being close to the city was the increased access to resources and manpower. South-west of Abusir, workers could exploit a limestone quarry to gather resources for the manufacture of masonry blocks used in the construction of the pyramid. The limestone there was particularly easy to quarry considering that gravel, sand and tafl layers sandwiched the limestone into thin segments of between and thick making it easier to dislodge from its matrix. In 1838, John Shae Perring, an engineer working under Colonel Howard Vyse, cleared the entrances to the pyramids of Sahure, Neferirkare and Nyuserre. Five years later, the Egyptologist Karl Richard Lepsius, sponsored by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, explored the Abusir necropolis and catalogued Neferirkare's pyramid as XXI. It was Lepsius who proposed the theory that the accretion layer method of construction was applied to the pyramids of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty. One important development was the discovery of the Abusir papyri, found in the temple of Neferirkare during illicit excavations in 1893. In 19028, the Egyptologist Ludwig Borchardt, working for the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft or German Oriental Society, resurveyed those same pyramids and had their adjoining temples and causeways excavated. Borchardt's was the first, and only other, major expedition carried out at the Abusir necropolis, and contributed significantly to archaeological investigation at the site. His findings were published in Das Grabdenkmal des Königs Nefer-Ir-Ke-Re (1909). The Czech Institute of Egyptology has had a long-term excavation project going at the site since the 1960s.  Mortuary complex  Three dimensional model of Neferirkare's mortuary complex = Layout = Pyramid construction techniques underwent a transition in the Fifth Dynasty. The monumentality of the pyramids diminished, the design of mortuary temples changed, and the substructure of the pyramid became standardized. By contrast, relief decoration proliferated and the temples were enriched with greater storeroom complexes. These two conceptual changes had developed by the time of Sahure's reign at the latest. Sahure's mortuary complex indicates that symbolic expression through decoration became favoured over sheer magnitude. For example, Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Khufu's complex had a total of 100 linear metres (330 linear feet) reserved for decoration, while Sahure's temple had around 370 linear metres (1,200 linear feet) dedicated to relief decorations. Bárta identifies that storage space in mortuary temples expanded consistently from Neferirkare's reign onwards. This was a result of the combined centralization of administrative focus onto the funerary cult, the increase in the numbers of priests and officials involved in the maintenance of the cult, and the increase in their revenues. The discovery of considerable remains of stone vessels mostly broken or otherwise incomplete in the pyramid temples of Sahure, Neferirkare, and Neferefre bears testament to this development. Old Kingdom mortuary complexes consisted of five essential components: (1) a valley temple; (2) a causeway; (3) a mortuary temple; (4) a cult pyramid; and (5) the main pyramid. Neferirkare's mortuary complex only had two of these basic elements: a mortuary temple which had been hastily constructed from cheap mudbrick and wood; and the largest main pyramid at the site. The valley temple and causeway that were originally intended for Neferirkare's monument were co-opted by Nyuserre for his own mortuary complex. Conversely, a cult pyramid never entered construction, as a consequence of the rush to complete the monument upon Neferirkare's death. Its replacement was a small settlement and lodgings constructed from mudbrick to the south of the complex where the priests would live. An enormous brick enclosure wall was built around the perimeter of the pyramid and mortuary temple to complete Neferirkare's funerary monument. = Main pyramid = The monument was intended as a step pyramid, an unusual choice for a Fifth Dynasty king, given that the era of step pyramids ended with the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC) centuries prior, depending on the scholar and source. The reasoning behind this choice is not understood. The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner considers a speculative connection between the Turin Canon's listing him \\"as the founder of a new dynasty\\" and the original project, though he also considers the possibility of religious reasons and power politics as well. The first build contained six carefully laid steps of high quality stone blocks reaching a height of . A white limestone casing was to be applied to the structure, but after minimal work on this was completed extending only to the first step the pyramid was redesigned to form a \\"true pyramid\\". Verner describes the architecture of a Fifth Dynasty pyramid thusly; The three stages of the pyramid's construction. Light grey: original six step core of the planned step pyramid. Dark grey: extension project with two extra steps. Beige: planned granite casing. Internally, the corridor and three layer limestone gable roof of the ante- and burial- chamber are also depicted. To convert the step into a genuine pyramid, the whole structure was extended outwards by about and raised a further two steps in height. This expansion project was completed in rough order with small stone fragments that were intended to be cased in red granite. The premature death of the king halted the project after only the lowest level(s) of the casing had been completed. The resultant base of the structure measured on each side, and, had the project been completed, the pyramid would have reached approximately in height with an inclination from base to tip of about 54°. Despite the incompleteness of the structure, the pyramid which is of comparable size to Menkaure's pyramid at Giza dominates over its surrounds as a result of the position of its site standing on a hill some above the Nile delta. = Substructure = alt=Photograph of architectural remains The descending corridor near the middle of the north face of the pyramid serves as the entry into the substructure of Neferirkare's pyramid. The corridor begins approximately above ground level and ends at a similar depth below ground level. It has proportions of height and width. It is reinforced at the entrance and exit points with granite casing. The corridor breaks out into a vestibule leading to a longer corridor that is guarded by a portcullis. This second corridor has two turns, but maintains a generally eastward direction and ends in an antechamber that is offset from the burial chamber. The roof of the corridor is unique: the flat roof has a second gabled roof made of limestone on top of it which itself has a third roof made from a layer of reeds. The burial and ante chamber's ceilings were constructed with three gabled layers of limestone. The beams disperse weight from the superstructure onto either side of the passageway, preventing collapse. Thieves have ransacked the chambers of its limestone making it impossible to properly reconstruct, though some details can still be discerned. Namely, that (1) both rooms were oriented along an east-west axis, (2) both chambers were the same width; the antechamber was shorter of the two, and (3) both chambers had the same style roof, and are missing one layer of limestone. Overall, the substructure is badly damaged: the collapse of a layer of the limestone beams has covered the burial chamber. No trace of the mummy, sarcophagus, or any burial equipment has been found inside. The severity of the damage to the substructure prevents further excavation. = Mortuary temple = alt=Photograph of a mortuary temple The mortuary temple is located at the base of the pyramid's Eastern face. It is larger than is typical for the period. Archaeological evidence suggests that it was unfinished at Neferirkare's death, and was completed by Neferefre and Nyuserre. For example, while the inner temple and statue niches were built from stone, much of the rest of the temple, including the court and entrance hall, was apparently hastily completed using cheap mudbrick and wood. This left large portions of the mortuary temple susceptible to erosion from rain and wind, where stone would have given it significant durability. The site was less aesthetically impressive, although its basic layout and features remained roughly analogous to Sahure's temple. Its enlarged size can be attributed to a design decision to build the complex without a valley temple or a causeway. Instead, the causeway and temple, whose foundations had been constructed, were diverted to Nyuserre's complex. Layout of Neferirkare's mortuary temple. In order: (1) entry portico; (2) entry hall; (3) courtyard with (4) wooden columns; (5) transverse corridor; (6) storerooms, notable for the Abusir papyri found there; (7) inner temple; (8) columned corridor leading to (9) a passageway into the main courtyard. The temple was entered through the columned portico, and columned entrance hall which terminates into a large columned courtyard. The columns of the hall and courtyard are made from wood arranged into the form of lotus stalks and buds. The courtyard is adorned with thirty-seven such columns; these columns are asymmetrically positioned. The archaeologist Herbert Ricke hypothesized that columns near the altar may have been damaged by fire and removed. A papyrus fragment from the temple archives corroborates this story. A low stepped ramp in the courtyard's west leads to a transverse (north-south) corridor which leads south into storerooms and north into another smaller corridor containing six wooden columns through which the open courtyard of the main pyramid can be accessed. It is in the southern storerooms that the Abusir papyri were discovered by graverobbers in the 1890s. Beyond the storerooms is a gate which has another access point to the main pyramid's courtyard, and through which a second excavated south-western gate leads to Khentkaus II's complex. Finally, traversing across the corridor leads directly into the inner sanctuary or temple. A lotus shaped papyrus column similar to those found in the mortuary temple The surviving reliefs are fragmentary. Of the preserved materials, one particular block stands out as vitally important in reconstructing the genealogy of the royal family at this time. A limestone block, discovered in the 1930s by Egyptologist Édouard Ghazouli, depicts Neferirkare with his consort, Khentkaus II, and eldest son, Neferefre. It was not found at the site of the pyramid, but as a part of a house in the village of Abusir. The Abusir papyri document details concerning Neferirkare's mortuary temple at Abusir. One testimony from the papyri is that five statues were housed in the niches of the central chapel. The central statue depicted Neferirkare as the deity Osiris, whereas the two outermost statues portrayed him as the king of Upper and Lower Egypt respectively. The papyri also record the existence of at least four funerary boats at Abusir. Two boats are located in sealed rooms while the other two are to the north and south of the pyramid itself. The southern boat was discovered when Verner unearthed the funerary boat during excavations. = Valley temple, causeway and cult pyramid = At the time of Neferirkare's death, only the foundations of the valley temple and two-thirds of the causeway to the mortuary temple had been laid. When Nyuserre took over the site, he had the causeway diverted from its original destination to his own mortuary temple. As such, the causeway travels in one direction for more than half its distance, then bends away to another for the remainder of its length. The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. It had a burial chamber but was not used for burials, and instead appears to have been a purely symbolic structure. It may have hosted the pharaoh's ka (spirit), or a miniature statue of the king. It may have been used for ritual performances centering around the burial and resurrection of the ka spirit during the Sed festival. Neferirkare's monument has no cult pyramid. Rather, the cult pyramid was replaced with a small settlement, called Ba Kakai, of mudbrick lodgings for priests, south of the monument. The omission of these \\"essential\\" elements has had one significant impact. Under normal circumstances, the priests tending to the deceased pharaoh's funerary cult would have lived in a 'pyramid town' built in the vicinity of the valley temple, situated on the Abusir Lake. The daily records of the administration would have had their residence in the town with the priests. Instead, as a result of circumstance, these documents were instead kept inside the mortuary temple. This has allowed their archives to be preserved, as they would have otherwise long ago disintegrated, buried under the mud. The siting of the settlement by the complex also allowed small restorative works to be conducted. = Later history = Nyuserre was the last king to build his funerary monument at Abusir; his successors Menkauhor and Djedkare Isesi chose sites elsewhere. Abusir thus ceased to be the royal necropolis. This did not mean that the site had been abandoned. The records of the Abusir Papyri demonstrate that funerary cults remained active at Abusir at least until the reign of Pepi II at the end of the Sixth Dynasty. Verner believes that royal cultic activities ceased by the First Intermediate Period. Málek, notes that some limited evidence for the persistence of the cults of Neferirkare and Nyuserre throughout the Herakleopolitan Period exists, though this means that Nyuserre's cult operated continuously until at least the Twelfth Dynasty. Professor Antonio Morales believes that funerary cults may have continued beyond the Old Kingdom, in particular the cult of Nyuserre appears to have survived both in its official form and in popular public veneration until the early Middle Kingdom, and some scant evidence in the form of two statues dated to the Middle Kingdom may suggest that Neferirkare's cult was active during that period as well. The necropolae near Memphis, specifically those at Saqqara and Abusir, were used extensively during the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty (ca. 664525 BC). Considerable quantities of stone were required to build these tombs, and this was very probably sourced from the Old Kingdom pyramids, thereby inflicting further damage to them. Graves estimated to be from the fifth century BC have been discovered in the vicinity of Neferirkare's mortuary temple. One yellow calcite gravestone, discovered by Borchardt, bears an Aramaic inscription: \\"(Belonging) to Nsnw, the daughter of Paḥnûm\\" alternatively read as \\"(Belonging) to Nesneu, the daughter of Tapakhnum\\". A second inscription, found by Verner on a limestone block in the mortuary temple bears the inscription: \\"Mannu-ki-na'an son of Šewa\\". The dating of this second inscription is uncertain, but may plausibly be from the same period.

In consequence, Borchardt neglected to properly examine it beyond conducting a brief survey of the site while there. It was not until Verner's Czech team's excavations in the 1970s that the structure was identified as being the pyramid tomb of Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II. Perring had previously discovered griffonage on a limestone block from the site of Neferirkare's tomb which attested to his consort \\"the King's wife Khentkawes\\". Further corroborating evidence is her appearance in a relief of the royal family found on another limestone block on which Neferirkare's son, Neferefre, also appears. Her pyramid was constructed in two phases. The first phase of the construction must have begun during Neferirkare's reign, as is evidenced by the inscription that Perring had discovered. The project was halted around the tenth year of Neferirkare's reign, but later resumed until the complex was completed. Verner suggests that Neferirkare's untimely death interrupted the project and that it was ultimately finished during Nyuserre's reign. The word \\"mother\\" appears inscribed above \\"wife\\" on another block indicating that the relationship between Khentkaus II and Nyuserre was as mother and son. The completed structure has a square base measuring across each side, and with a slope of 52° would stand tall were it not in ruins. Her mortuary complex also includes a satellite pyramid, a courtyard, and an extended mortuary temple. = Unfinished pyramid (Neferefre) = Located directly south-west of Neferirkare's monument, and just to the west of Khentkaus II's, Neferefre's unfinished pyramid is another member of the family cemetery born around Neferirkare's tomb. Built on the Abusir diagonal, Neferefre's pyramid was never completed owing to the unexpectedly early death of the pharaoh. Originally built with a base length of , slightly shorter than that of Sahure's pyramid, and with only a single step completed, the plan had to be altered to accommodate the remains of the king. For this reason, the pyramid was hastily converted into a squared mastaba and completed with the application of limestone facing at a slope of 78° and a clay and desert stone capping. The accompanying mortuary temple is believed to have been built promptly following Neferefre's death. The main features of the temple were a hypostyle hall, two large wooden boats, and a number of broken statues found in rooms near the aforementioned hall. = Nyuserre's pyramid = Pyramids of Nyuserre Ini (left) and Neferirkare (right) Nyuserre joined the family cemetery with his mortuary complex, and was the last king to be interred in the Abusir necropolis. Upon taking the throne, Nyuserre undertook to complete the three unfinished monuments of his closest family members: his father, Neferirkare; his mother, Khentkaus II; and his brother, Neferefre. The costs of this project burdened the construction of his own monument, which manifested itself in the siting of the complex. Instead of being seated on the Abusir-Heliopolis axis, Nyuserre's complex is nestled between Neferirkare's and Sahure's pyramids. Respecting the axis would have meant placing the complex south-west of Neferefre's unfinished pyramid, and far from the Nile valley. The expense would have been unreasonable. The pyramid, located north- east of Neferirkare's pyramid, stands around tall with a base length of about . The causeway connecting the valley temple to the mortuary complex was originally intended for Neferirkare's pyramid, but Nyuserre had these diverted, to serve his monument.  Abusir papyri  alt=Photograph of Abusir papyrus The monument's significance comes from the circumstances of its construction, and the contents of the Abusir papyri archives. The French Egyptologist Nicolas Grimal states that: \\"[t]his was the most important known collection of papyri from the Old Kingdom until the 1982 expedition of the Egyptological Institute of the University of Prague discovered an even richer cache in a storeroom of the nearby mortuary temple of Neferefre.\\" The first fragments of the Abusir papyri were discovered by illicit diggers in 1893, and sold and distributed around the world in the antiquities market. Later, Borchardt discovered additional fragments while excavating in the same area. The fragments were found to be written in hieratic; a cursive form of hieroglyphics. Other papyri found in Neferirkare's tomb were comprehensively studied and published by the French Egyptologist Paule Posener-Kriéger. The papyri records span the period between the reign of Djedkare Isesi through to the reign of Pepi II. They recount all aspects of the management of the funerary cult of the king including the daily activities of priests, lists of offerings, letters, and inventory checks of the temple. Importantly, the papyri connect the larger picture of the interplay between the mortuary temple, sun temple and other institutions. For example, the fragmentary evidence of the papyri indicates that goods for Neferirkare's funerary cult were transported by ship to the pyramid complex of the king. The full extent of the records of the papyri found at Abusir is unknown as more recent findings remain unpublished.

See items 3*, 7a*, 65, 181, 207 in Tov's bibliography Tov's initial publications on the Septuagint deal with that translation's early revisions that were intended to approximate the Greek text to the Hebrew text current in Israel from the 1st century BCE until the 2nd century CE. For that research, he established sound principles by determining the criteria for defining and characterizing the revisions. His preoccupation with matters of translation technique and the reconstruction of the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint was influenced by his practical work in the HUBP (Hebrew University Bible Project). In that research, he combined the field work in that project with the formulation of abstract rules for the evaluation of details in the Septuagint, constantly cross-fertilizing both areas. These rules were formulated in his theoretical book on the Septuagint that grew out of his courses at the Hebrew University, each year on a different Bible book The Text-Critical Use of the Septuagint in Biblical Research (Third Edition, Completely Revised and Enlarged; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2015). Subsequently, the focus of Tov's interest moved to the importance of the Septuagint for biblical scholarship, both for textual and literary criticism. In several books, the Septuagint reflects a Hebrew basis that needs to be taken into consideration in the exegesis of those books beyond small details, both when, according to Tov, the Hebrew parent text of the Septuagint preceded the Masoretic Text (Joshua, 1 Samuel 16–18, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc.) and when it serves as an exegetical layer reacting to the forerunner of the Masoretic Text (1 Kings, Esther, and Daniel). According to Tov, in all these books the exegete of the Hebrew books must take the Greek translation into consideration. A precondition for this procedure is that the analysis of the translation technique as described in the previous paragraph will have established that the Septuagint is a good source for analyzing the text that lay in front of him. From among all the early witnesses of the biblical text, the best ones for analyzing the stages of its literary development are the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint, a few Qumran texts and the Samaritan Pentateuch. Tov believes that the analysis of early witnesses such as the Septuagint enriches our exegesis and helps us in understanding the last stages of the development of the biblical literature in specific books. =Development of the Bible text= Emanuel Tov does not describe the development of the biblical text based on abstract theories, but tries to take the evidence of the ancient manuscripts and versions as his point of departure. It is clear that in antiquity many versions of the Bible were circulating, as is evident from the textual plurality at Qumran. All the manuscripts differed from one another, but within that plurality one may recognize some groups (families). Tov qualified this plurality by providing the internal statistics of the different types of the Qumran scrolls. He also described the socio-religious background of some groups of the Judean Desert scrolls.See items 171 and 178 in Tov's bibliography. An important link in this argumentation is the group of the so-called 4QReworked Pentateuch texts. Ten years after Tov published this group of documents ,Together with S. A. White: \\"4QReworked Pentateuchb–e and 4QTemple?\\" in H. Attridge et al., in consultation with J. VanderKam, Qumran Cave 4.VIII, Parabiblical Texts, Part 1 (DJD XIII; Oxford: Clarendon, 1994) 187–351, 459–63 and plates XIII–XXXXVI he realized that these texts do not reflect a single non-biblical rewritten Pentateuch composition, but a cluster of biblical texts that included many exegetical elements. These texts reflect a link in the series of developing biblical texts. See items 206a and 216 in Tovs bibliography. Tov's studies on the Septuagint and 4QReworked Pentateuch led him to new thoughts regarding the development of the last stages of the biblical books and the original text of these books. In his view, the early stages of the biblical books such as reflected in the Septuagint of 1 Samuel, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, show that the formulations of these books developed stage by stage. This reconstructed development makes it difficult to posit an original text of the biblical books. In Tov's view, there was not one original text, but a series of \\"original texts.\\" This view developed after the appearance of the second edition of his Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible (2001) and was emphasized more in the third edition (2012). See \\"The Many Forms of Scripture: Reflections in Light of the LXX and 4QReworked Pentateuch,\\" in From Qumran to Aleppo: A Discussion with Emanuel Tov about the Textual History of Jewish Scriptures in Honor of his 65th Birthday (ed. A. Lange et al.; FRLANT 230; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2009) 11–28. =The development of the text of the Torah= In studies primarily carried out in the 2010s, Tov focused on the special textual status of the Torah. See items 210, 224, 244, 260, 261, 264, 283, 290 in the bibliography in the website In his view, the textual development of the Torah differed from that of all other Scripture books, probably because of its popularity. The Masoretic Text reflects the presumed original text better than all other preserved texts, all of which reflect more secondary elements than MT, especially the one-time joined tradition of the Samaritan Pentateuch and the LXX. Further, the number of the non-Masoretic textual branches in the Torah is much larger than in all other Scripture books. =Dead Sea Scrolls and the Qumran scribes= Emanuel Tov dealt with various aspects of the Qumran scrolls, but his most central publications pertain to the Qumran scribes. In 2004, he published a detailed monograph on the scribal practices reflected in the Qumran scrolls, suggesting that the information about these scribal practices allows us to obtain a better understanding of the Qumran scrolls. Scribal Practices and Approaches Reflected in the Texts Found in the Judean Desert (STDJ 54; Leiden/Boston: E.J. Brill, 2004) This monograph describes the technical aspects of all the Judean Desert texts, such as the measurements of the columns and sheets, the beginnings and ends of scrolls, systems of correcting mistakes, orthography systems, and a classification of the scrolls according to these parameters. An important part of this description is Tov's theory on the Qumran scribes. Since 1986, Tov has suggested the division of the Qumran scrolls into two groups distinguished by external features. Group 1 is written in a special spelling (forms like ki’), specials linguistic forms (like malkehemah, me’odah), and special scribal habits (writing the divine name in the old Hebrew script, erasing elements with lines and writing cancellation dots above and below words and letters, writing dots in the margins guiding the drawing of the lines, etc.). The great majority of the Qumran sectarian scrolls belong to this group; hence Tov's suggestion that these scrolls were written by sectarian scribes, possibly at Qumran. These scribes copied biblical as well as extra-biblical scrolls, altogether one-third of the Qumran scrolls, while the other scrolls (group 2) were brought to Qumran from outside, from one or more localities. For the latest formulation of this view, see item 13 in list 4 below, \\"Books Authored\\" (Scribal Practices) =Computer-assisted research of the Bible and the Dead Sea Scrolls= Emanuel Tov believes that the examination of the Bible and Dead Sea Scrolls needs to be aided by computer- assisted research and that therefore databases and computer programs need to be developed. He supervised the electronic encoding of the Leningrad Codex in the 1980s. This encoding was published among others in: JPS Hebrew–English Tanakh: The Traditional Hebrew Text and the New JPS Translation (2d. ed.; Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1999). At that time, he also embarked upon a research project together with Prof. Robert A. Kraft of the University of Pennsylvania (CATSS = Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies). That project, based in Philadelphia and Jerusalem, created a comparative database of all the words in the Masoretic Text and the Septuagint. It was published as a module within the Accordance program (subsequently also within Bible Works and Logos). With the aid of that program, which allows for advanced searches and statistical research, several such investigations have been carried out by Tov and others. For a listing, see Tov's website under bibliography, CATSS Another database edited by Tov contains all the texts and images of the para-biblical Dead Sea Scrolls, in the original languages and in translation, with morphological analysis and search programs. All these programs serve the international community.

A child's print awareness is closely associated with his or her word awareness or the ability to recognize words as distinct elements of oral and written communication. Both skills are acquired in the child's natural environment. Measurement Print awareness is a multi-faceted skill that is difficult to isolate and define. The most effective measures analyze the child's knowledge of letters, print symbols, and reading conventions. To analyze book reading conventions the child is asked to identify the front of the book, identify which page is read first (the left page or the right page). This type of evaluation produces considerable variation among preschoolers (Justice and Ezell, 2001). Significance Along with phonological awareness, print awareness is a strong determinant of early reading achievement (Adams, 1990). Print awareness is included in the preliteracy skills that children entering first grade are expected to have mastered. The first-grade curriculum is designed around this assumption. Children who have low levels of print awareness are likely to fall behind. Children who come from print-rich homes where they are constantly exposed to adult models are more likely to develop print awareness than their peers. Since print awareness emerges naturally, the influence of the home environment is significant. A number of characteristics of the home environment can be altered to enhance a child's print awareness. Interventions Since print awareness has been identified as an important precursor to literacy, numerous interventions have been designed to enhance the print awareness and preliteracy skills of at-risk children. Many of them focus on storybook reading or joint-book reading. This is a common practice in print-rich homes and some simple alterations of daily routines can have a huge impact on the child's preliteracy skills. Storybook reading can improve a child's print awareness when the parent (or other adult such as a teacher) uses a technique referred to as print referencing. Print referencing occurs when verbal or non-verbal cues are used to encourage a child's attention or interaction with print. An example of this is a parent asking the child to point to the first word on a page or to ask \\"Where are the words on this page?\\" See also *joint-book reading *Preliteracy References *Adams, M.J.

Excavation of the three caves began in 1937, and they were the site of some of Montana's first professional archeological studies. Over 30,000 artifacts have been identified, with at least 20,000 animal remains recovered from the site. Species range from large mammalian species, including bison (Bos bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus), to various species of herpetiles (reptiles and amphibians) and avies (birds). The presence of these remains result from human predation, processing and consumption as well as non-human (carnivores and raptors) predation and individual species who lived and died in and around the site. Paintings known as pictographs are still visible in Pictograph Cave, which is the largest of the three caves. The pictographs are thought to be between 200 and 2,100 years old. However their interpretations are still debated over. The oldest pictograph is that of a turtle, radio-carbon dated to be approximately 2,100 years old. These pictographs are paintings of animals, warriors, and even rifles that document the story of the Native Americans of the area for thousands of years. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964. State park Ghost cave The caves are part of Pictograph Cave State Park, which features paved trails to the caves with interpretive signs about the paintings, the area's geology and vegetation. The park encompasses and includes a visitor center and picnic facilities. The natural shelters are nestled in a sandstone bluff on a well-traversed path extending south from the confluence of Bitter Creek and the Yellowstone River, south of Billings. The cave complex has long been a site of mystical power, a culturally significant gathering place for American Indians. On the interior wall of Pictograph Cave (the only one containing rock art), archaeologists discovered 106 pictographs, painted between 2,145 and 200 years ago. The walls were covered with red, white, and occasionally yellow figurines over drawings originally painted with black. They also found stone and bone tools, moccasins, arrow shafts, basketry, grinding stones, and fire-starting tools. Excavations turned up jewelry too, such as pendants, bracelets, and beads crafted of seashells acquired from Pacific Coast Indians. The excavation was led by H. Melville Sayre of the Montana School of Mines. He later hired Oscar Lewis, an archeologist from the Glendive WPA crew, to help supervise the dig. William Mulloy replaced Sayre as the Project director from Oct. 1940 to Feb. 1942. Development and perception of the site An example of a faded red pictograph on the site. Conversion of the site into a State Park was not accomplished easily. The 22-acre property was originally purchased by the State of Montana in 1937 and placed under the jurisdiction of the Montana Highway Commission. During the excavation period covering 1938 to 1941 (which included notable discoveries such as the \\"barbed harpoon points of the Eskimo culture, made of caribou horn,\\" the graves of nine plus individuals, and over 30,000 artifacts), over 10,000 visitors were recorded at the site. During that time, public interest was so intense that a small museum and visitor center was constructed. The building was also used to process artifacts that were continually flowing from the caves. L. B. McMullen, then President of Eastern Montana Normal School, was instrumental in developing the original museum located at the site. When the excavation was halted due to the onset of World War II, interest in the site waned. Visitation at the site was not controlled, the artifacts were not tracked well (most still cannot be accounted for today), and the museum at the site was broken into numerous times and eventually burned by vandals. In 1963 Mayor Willard Fraser signed an agreement stating that the City of Billings would take over administration of the park from the Montana State Department of Highways. This move was met with criticism from aldermen who expressed concerns over the city's ability to monitor the park, assume liabilities, and provide services. The distance of the park from the city was also of major concern. \\"We'd just be inviting kids to raise all kinds of hell\\" was the position of Alderman Joe Leone. Regardless of their opposition, Mayor Fraser saw the potential to attract tourists to the site (Billings Gazette 1963). The site was designated a National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964. The city turned over the caves' management to the Parks Division of the Montana Department of Fish and Game in 1969; the site became a state park in 1991.

The term can be used to describe any spoon with slots, holes or other openings in the bowl of the spoon which let liquid pass through while preserving the larger solids on top. It is similar in function to a sieve; however, a ladle-sized slotted spoon is most typically used to retrieve items from a cooking liquid while preserving the liquid in the pot, while table- sized slotted spoons are often used to serve foods prepared or packaged in juices, such as canned fruit and vegetables. One peculiar example of a slotted spoon is used in the traditional absinthe preparation ritual. A special absinthe spoon with a disproportionately weighted, often ornately decorated, and mostly flat bowl is balanced upon the rim of a glass, on which is placed a sugar cube and through which ice water is poured or dripped into the drink. The slots in the spoon ensure that only fully dissolved sugar reaches the beverage, and the slow trickle of water accentuates the appearance of the louche.

The firm has in excess of 100 staff, and specialises in human rights cases, employment law, defamation, civil litigation, public law and personal injury litigation (including medical negligence). Background The firm has three partners, Martin Howe BA (Hons), Kieran O'Rourke LLB (Hons), and David Enright LLB (Hons), all solicitors. The firm has been involved in several high-profile cases, including human rights claims following the Stansted Airport hijacking in February 2000, the criminal cases and human rights claims following the 3-day siege at the Greek Embassy in February 1999, and the successful House of Lords challenge to the safety of France for asylum seekers (R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Adan & Aitseguer (2001) 2 AC 477).R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Adan & Aitseguer (2001) 2 AC 477 Howe & Co currently acts for approximately 2,000 British Army Gurkha veterans who are challenging the British Government's refusal to allow them a right to settle and live in the UK. The firm was instructed by Tul Bahadur Pun VC, an 84-year-old Gurkha veteran who won Britain's highest military award for gallantry, the Victoria Cross, during the Second World War. Mr Tul Bahdur Pun VC was refused a right to settle in the United Kingdom. Howe & Co set up a website to assist Mr Pun VC's campaign to win the right to settle in the United Kingdom named. On 1 June 2007, the British Asylum & Immigration Minister, Liam Byrne, stated that due to the \\"exceptional\\" nature of the case, Mr Pun VC would be allowed to live in the United Kingdom. Along with actress Joanna Lumley, Peter Carroll, and Sir Jack Hayward, Howe & Co's Senior Partner, Martin Howe, is one of the \\"Gurkha Justice Campaign\\" organisers. The Gurkha Justice Campaign is seeking a change in the UK law to allow all Gurkhas the right to live in Britain. On 30 September 2008 Howe & Co won a High Court of Justice legal challenge to the British Home Office's policy refusing Gurkhas who retired prior to 1997 the right to settle in the UK, in a decision which could open the door to 2,000 retired Gurkhas being allowed to live in Britain. The head of the firm's Human Rights and Immigration Department, David Howe, is currently involved in representing a number of foreign nationals facing deportation by the British Home Office, following criminal conviction in the United Kingdom, and also a test case against the Home Office's decision to exclude unaccompanied minors from the Family Indefinite Leave to Remain Policy introduced in October 2003. In January 2009 Howe & Co were instructed by the former radio presenter and The Sun columnist, Jon Gaunt, to pursue a legal action against the talkSPORT radio station following termination of his radio presenter contract, after an interview with Redbridge Council's Michael Stark on 7 November 2008, in which Jon Gaunt branded Councillor Stark a \\"Nazi\\" and \\"an ignorant pig\\" live on air. The firm holds the Specialist Quality Mark (SQM) awarded by the Legal Services Commission and, following an independent \\"Peer Review\\" audit of Howe & Co's publicly funded legal work, the Legal Services Commission and the Institute of Advance Legal Studies awarded the firm a rating of: \\"1 - Excellence\\". In June 2006, one of the firm's partners, David Enright, was shortlisted for a Law Society sponsored award at the Legal Aid Practitioners' Group's \\"Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Awards 2006\\". In November 2008, Howe & Co's Senior Partner, Martin Howe, was jointly awarded the Ross McWhirter Foundation Award for citizenship for his work on the Gurkha Justice campaign. In December 2008, Martin Howe was also shortlisted for the award of \\"Human Rights Lawyer of the Year\\" by Liberty and JUSTICE in an award sponsored by the Law Society of England and Wales.

The park and public lands are managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Wildlife This park is home to mammalian species including moose, squirrels, white-tailed deer, foxes, black bears and coyotes. History During the 1930s, workers with the Works Progress Administration began developing the area that would become Mount Blue State Park. The state of Maine took possession from the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1955. In 2002, the park saw a 50% increase in size when the state purchased 2,468 acres from a subsidiary of McDonald Investment Company for $980,000. The funds used to purchase the land came from the Land for Maine’s Future program, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund and private donations. The land purchased included the 1,298-foot peak known as Hedgehog Hill. Activities and amenities The park offers a nature center, camping at 136 campsites, swimming area, motorized and non-motorized boating, fishing, and hunting. The extensive trail system is used for hiking, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling, and ATV riding. The park is open year-round.

Early life Surtees maternal grandfather, Robert Surtees of Redworth Hall. Surtees was born in South Bailey, Durham on 1 April 1779. He was the only surviving child of Dorothy Surtees (d. 1797) and Robert Surtees of Mainsforth (d. 1802), who were first cousins. His maternal grandparents were Robert Surtees of Redworth Hall, and the former Dorothy Lambton (second daughter of Thomas Lambton of Hardwick). His aunt, Jane Surtees (co-heiresses of their father Robert Surtees), also married a first cousin, Lt. Crosier Surtees, who died in 1803 when returning from a banquet with Lord Barnard at Raby Castle when he drunkenly fell into the moors and froze to death. They were grandparents of Henry Surtees, who inherited Redworth Hall, and Charles Surtees, who eventually inherited Mainsforth Hall. He was educated at Kepier School, Houghton-le-Spring, and later at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating with a B.A. degree in 1800 and a M.A. degree in 1803. In school, he befriended Reginald Heber, later The Right Reverend Bishop of Calcutta. Career Surtees' The History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham In 1802, upon the death of his father, he inherited the family estate including Mainsforth Hall. Although a student of law he never practised as a lawyer, and instead devoted himself to the study of literature and antiquities. By 1804, Surtees had begun collecting material for what was to become his monumental county history, The History of Durham. He was a studious and sensitive man who did not always have good health. He was hospitable at Mainsforth, and guests included Sir Walter Scott, with whom Surtees frequently corresponded. By 1816, the first volume of The History and Antiquities of the County Palatine of Durham was published (\\"compiled from original records preserved in public repositories and private collections by Robert Surtees\\"). Two further volumes followed and a final volume was published posthumously in 1840. The work covers much of the county but does not include Weardale, Teesdale, the Aucklands, Brancepeth, or Durham Castle or Cathedral. James Raine compiled The History and Antiquities of North Durham (2 vols, 1830 and 1852) to supply the need.Raine, James (1852) The History and Antiquities of North Durham. London: J. B. Nichols // Surtees: Durham - Vol. 1, 1816; v. 2–3, 1820–23; v. 4, 1840 (with memoir of the author, by George Taylor); vol. 4 edited by James Raine; each volume contains numerous pedigrees. Personal life On 23 June 1807, he married Anne Robinson (b. 1785), a daughter of Ralph Robinson of Middle Herrington, Durham, but they had no children. Christian faith was central in Surtees's life and he regularly worshipped at Bishop Middleham parish church. Never in good health, Surtees complained of a cold in January 1834, complications developed and he died on 13 February 1834, with his wife at his bedside. He was buried in Bishop Middleham churchyard, and a monument to him was later erected there. His wife Anne survived him, living in Mainsforth until her death in March 1868. Legacy Immediately following Surtees' death, in May 1834, James Raine and other former friends established the Surtees Society to honour his memory and continue his work.

Byrne's formal education was limited to rural school; but, he frequently read books from his own large library. He was married to Emilie (Emma) Beaver and they had five children. Career In 1879, he drove a team of oxen to Sioux Falls in what was then Dakota Territory. Byrne worked for homesteaders near Sioux Falls until filing on his own claim in McCook County in 1880. In 1883, he sold his claim and moved to Faulk County to sell insurance. In 1885 and 1886, Byrne spent time in the northern part of Dakota Territory, investing in an insurance company in Fargo and then represented the firm in Faulk and Potter Counties in 1888. Byrne became involved in politics when officials at Forest City, South Dakota refused to surrender the Potter County records to Gettysburg during a dispute over the site of the county seat. Byrne was one of several men who organized the raiding party, which successfully brought the records to Gettysburg. In 1889, Byrne held his first political office as state senator from Faulk and Potter Counties but lost the election in 1890. He served as treasurer of Faulk County for four years. Byrne and his former tutor, Coe I. Crawford, became involved with South Dakota's Progressives; and, Byrne represented his district as state senator in 1907 and 1909. From 1911 to 1913, Byrne served as the ninth Lieutenant Governor of South Dakota during Robert S. Vessey's second term as governor. In March 1913, Byrne became Governor of South Dakota after a hard-fought campaign against Judge James W. McCarter, and went on to serve two terms from 1913 to 1917. In 1914, Byrne won re-election with Peter Norbeck as lieutenant governor. During his tenure, a tax commission was created and a state bank guaranty act was adopted through his persistence. Byrne completed his second term as governor and returned to Faulkton. In 1918, Byrne ran in the Republican primary for the United States Senate. He lost when Coe Crawford and Peter Norbeck both supported the incumbent, Thomas Sterling. He left politics until 1922, when Governor William H. McMaster appointed him as Commissioner of Agriculture, a position he held until retiring in 1924. Death A rheumatic condition forced Byrne to walk with a cane; and, he moved to the milder climates of Oregon and then California. Frank M. Byrne died in San Francisco, California and is interred at Halcyon Cemetery, Halcyon, California.

Location of Sainte-Marguerite within Lérins islands The Île Sainte-Marguerite () is the largest of the Lérins Islands, about half a mile off shore from the French Riviera town of Cannes. The island is approximately in length (east to west) and across. The island is most famous for its fortress prison (the Fort Royal), in which the so-called Man in the Iron Mask was held in the 17th century. History The island is first known to have been inhabited during Roman times, when it was known by the name Lero. The island was probably renamed in medieval times by crusaders, who built a chapel to Saint Margaret of Antioch on the island. In the 14th century, probably due to the writings of Raymond Féraud, the island became associated with a fictional Sainte Marguerite, sister to Saint Honoratus, founder of the monastery on the neighbouring Île Saint-Honorat. According to legend, Sainte Marguerite led a community of nuns on the island which was named after her. In 1612, ownership of the island passed from the monks of Saint-Honorat to Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Chevreuse. Shortly after, construction of a fort on the island (to become the Fort Royal) began. In 1635, the island was captured by the Spanish and recaptured by the French two years later. Towards the end of the 17th century, the Fort Royal became home to a barracks and state prison. During the 18th century, the present-day village of Sainte-Marguerite developed, thriving on the spending power of the soldiers stationed on the island. The Fort Royal was home to a number of famous prisoners until its closure in the 20th century. As well as the Man in the Iron Mask, a mysterious prisoner whose identity remains unknown, Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri (an Algerian rebel leader), Marquis Jouffroy d’Abbans (inventor of the steamboat) and Marshal Bazaine (the only successful escapee from the island) have all spent time there. Present Museum of the sea & prison of the iron mask A fifteen- minute boat ride from Cannes, the Île de Sainte-Marguerite is low in profile and heavily wooded with umbrella pines and eucalyptus. Both islands (with the Île Saint-Honorat) are looked after by the Office national des forêts, and are a popular tourist attraction of natural interest. During the summer months, a large number of boats moor in the shallow, protected \\"Plateau du Milieu\\", between the islands or on the landward side of Sainte-Marguerite where there is more room for water skiing, parascending and other popular water sports. The village of Sainte-Marguerite is made up of about twenty buildings. Most of these are home to fishermen, but there is also a small boatyard and one or two establishments offering refreshments to tourists. The island's hotel has been closed down since the summer of 2005. The historic Fort Royal now houses a youth hostel and a Museum of the Sea, featuring items recovered from ancient Roman and Saracen shipwrecks. Visitors are also able to view a number of former prison cells (including that occupied by the Man in the Iron Mask) and a Roman cistern room. Close to the Fort Royal is a small cemetery for French soldiers who died there when it was used for convalescence during the Crimean War, and alongside it is a cemetery for North African soldiers killed on the Allied side during World War II. It was in the news recently because the Indian businessman Vijay Mallya, owner of the Formula 1 team Force India and the Indian Premier League team Royal Challengers Bangalore, purchased “Le Grand Jardin,” or “The Large Garden”, a unique piece of luxury real estate on the Island of Sainte-Marguerite, for between €37 million and €43 million ($53–61 million US). The island is served all year round by a regular commercial ferry service from Cannes.

Bugkalot hunting party. The Bugkalot (also Ilongot or Ibilao) are a tribe who inhabit the southern Sierra Madre and Caraballo Mountains, on the east side of Luzon in the Philippines, primarily in the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija and along the mountain border between the provinces of Quirino and Aurora. They are also commonly referred to as \\"Ilongot\\", especially in older studies, but nowadays, the endonym Bugkalot is preferred in modern ethnic research.Mikkelsen, H. H. (2016). Chaosmology: Shamanism and personhood among the Bugkalot. HAU Journal of Ethnographic Theory. They were formerly headhunters.Mikkelsen, H. H. (2016). Chaosmology: Shamanism and personhood among the Bugkalot. HAU Journal of Ethnographic Theory. Presently, there are about 87,000 Bugkalots.https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12214/RP The Bugkalots tend to inhabit areas close to rivers, as they provide a food source and a means for transportation. Their native language is the Ilongot language, currently spoken by about 50,000 people. They also speak the Ilocano language.  Culture  Bugkalot men and women clearing the ground for rice planting. Photo taken in 1910 depicting Bugkalot men and a woman in modern-day Oyao in Nueva Vizcaya. In Ivan Salva's study in 1980 of the Bugkalots, she described \\"gender differences related to the positive cultural value placed on adventure, travel, and knowledge of the external world.\\" Bugkalot men, more often than women, visited distant places. They acquired knowledge of the outside world, amassed experiences there, and returned in order to share their knowledge, adventures, and feelings in a public oratory in order to pass on their knowledge to others. The Bugkalot men received acclaim as a result of their experiences. Because they lacked external experience on which to base knowledge and expression, Bugkalot women had inferior prestige. On the basis of Michelle Rosaldo's study and findings of other stateless societies, anthropologists must distinguish between prestige systems and actual power within a society. Just because a male has a high level of prestige, he may not own much economic or political power compared to others that are less prestigious within the society. Renato Rosaldo went on to study headhunting among the Bugkalots in his book Ilongot Headhunting, 1883-1974: A Study in Society and History. He notes headhunting raids are often associated with bereavement, a rage and expiation at the loss of a loved one. Indigenous religion The Bugkalot believe that outside the village and into the forest, one encounters a domain characterized by \\"erratic movement and transmutation\\", the quintessence of which is the shape-shifting spirit, Be'tang.\\"Cutting Cosmos: Masculinity and Spectacular Events among the Bugkalot\\" (2018), Henrik Hvenegaard Mikkelsen, *Delan: deity of the moon, worshiped with the sun and stars; congenial with Elag; during quarrels, Elag sometimes covers Delan's face, causing the different phases of the moon; giver of light and growthWilson, L.

Like many of his books, it is set in a world that draws heavily upon real times, events, places and people. In this particular book, the period is the Viking invasions of Saxon England. The story concerns a young Erling's attempt to prove himself as a warrior, his father's attempts to make amends for his mistakes, a young prince searching for revenge and a King's attempt to transform his realm into a more civilized one that will resist attacks from the Erlings forever. The books main themes are revenge, violence, the passing of an era, clash of cultures, and love, especially between father and son. Connections to other works by Kay The novel is set in the same world as Kay's The Lions of Al-Rassan and The Sarantine Mosaic, taking place at an indeterminate time. A passing reference to the mosaic Crispin created at the end of The Sarantine Mosaic and to the works of Rustem implies that decades or perhaps centuries have passed. A conversation about Leontes' time on the throne puts The Last Light of the Sun roughly three hundred years afterwards. Asharite merchants from Al-Rassan, and references to the Khalifate of Al-Rassan in the description of Firaz ibn Bakir, put this book chronologically either before or during the events of The Lions of Al-Rassan. Analogies to real world history *Aeldred, is based clearly on Alfred the Great. *The Erling culture is analogous to that of the Vikings. The \\"Cyngael\\" and \\"Anglcyn\\" are based on the Welsh people and the Anglo-Saxons, respectively. \\"Rheden\\" appears to be an analogue of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia. *The main religion of Jadism, the one hated by the Erlings, is clearly based upon Christianity. This religion also appears in The Lions of Al-Rassan and the Sarantine Mosaic. Plot Bern Thorkellson, a young Erling man, has been a slave on Rabady Island in Vinmark since his father Thorkell killed a man in a drunken fit of rage. He escapes from Rabady Island and travels to Jormsvik, a fortress for elite Erling mercenaries. He gains admittance to their ranks and joins a raiding party heading from Vinmark to Anglcyn. In Cyngael, Alun ap Owyn and his brother Dai, two Princes of the province of Cadyr, arrive at the house of Brynn ap Hywll, a renowned fighter and leader of another Cyngael province. They are accompanied by the famed Jaddite cleric Ceinon. In an attack by Erling raiders, Dai is killed and his soul is taken by a fairy to the fairy queen. Alun witnesses this event and later begins a relationship with one of the faeries. Among the Erlings who participated in the attack is Bern's father, Thorkell Einarsson, who is taken captive and becomes a retainer in Brynn's household. Anglcyn is ruled by Aeldred, who in his youth saved the kingdom from Erling conquest. Aeldred is building a strong nation and has begun to collect manuscripts and foster scholarship. One of the scholars he wishes to attract to his court is Ceinon, who is unwilling to give up his role as leader of the Jaddite faith among the Cyngael. Bern's team of mercenaries attack Anglcyn but are defeated by Aeldred's professional army. Bern and Thorkell have a brief reunion, but Bern rejoins the Erlings in a new quest to kill Brynn ap Hwyll and regain a famous sword. Once the Erlings arrive in Cyngael, they find themselves outnumbered and their fate is decided in a contest of single combat. Thorkell offers himself as the champion of the Cyngael and is slain in an act of sacrifice for his son. Prompted by Thorkell's final words, the Erlings depart and once again change course to loot an undefended monastery in a southern land. They return to Jormsviking with great wealth. After the combat Alun uses the sword of Ivarr's grandfather to kill the souls of mortals that had been taken as the faerie-queen's lovers and later discarded, including the soul of his own brother Dai. Alun's relationship with the faerie ends. Throughout the novel references are made towards the slow but steady growth of civilization as kingdoms are built, the wilderness is pushed back and it is revealed that even the most lawless places such as Jormsviking will eventually fall under the sway of a king. Most of the characters welcome the changes, which bring increased order and prosperity to their lands. The religion of Jad is strongly implied to play a civilizing role through its learned clerics and a shift towards a somewhat more restrained mentality. Reception January Magazine called The Last Light of the Sun Kay's \\"darkest and in some ways most ambitious novel to date\\".Lincoln Cho, Fantastic Journey, January Magazine, March 2004 A review on SF Site called it \\"an extremely evocative tale\\".Cindy Lynn Speer, 2004, SF Site, - The Last Light of the Sun A second review on SF Site by Alma H. Hromic noted: \\"It's another vivid, complex fantasy from Kay's pen. There is the usual sense that there is more, so much more, in the background of this story than the reader has been told -- the sense of glimpsing a few shining threads in a larger tapestry. A book to savour.\\"Alma H. Hromic, 2004, SF Site - The Last Light of the Sun Awards *Kay was nominated for the Canadian Sunburst Award nomination in 2005 for The Last Light of the Sun.

They are native to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia and New Guinea.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesAglaonema. Flora of China. They are known commonly as Chinese evergreens.Chen, J., et al. Cultural Guidelines for Commercial Production of Interiorscape Aglaonema. ENH957. Environmental Horticulture. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. 2003. Description These are evergreen perennial herbs with stems growing erect or decumbent and creeping. Stems that grow along the ground may root at the nodes. There is generally a crown of wide leaf blades which in wild species are often variegated with silver and green coloration. The inflorescence bears unisexual flowers in a spadix, with a short zone of female flowers near the base and a wider zone of male flowers nearer the tip. The fruit is a fleshy berry that ripens red. The fruit is a thin layer covering one large seed. Plants of the genus are native to humid, shady tropical forest habitat. Cultivation and uses Aglaonema costatum Aglaonema have been grown as luck-bringing ornamental plants in Asia for centuries. They were introduced to the West in 1885, when they were first brought to the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.Chen, J., et al. (2004). Genetic relationships of Aglaonema species and cultivars inferred from AFLP markers. Annals of Botany 93(2), 157-66. They have been cultivated, hybridized, and bred into a wide array of cultivars. They live in low-light conditions and are popular houseplants. This mainly tropical genus is known for its intolerance of cold temperatures. Chilling injury can begin at .Chen, J., et al. Chilling Injury in Tropical Foliage Plants: II. Aglaonema. ENH843. Environmental Horticulture. Florida Cooperative Extension Service. University of Florida IFAS. 2001. The injury manifests in dark, greasy-looking patches on the foliage. Cultivars have been selected for their shape and size, and especially for the color and pattern of the leaves. Many have white or cream-colored stems. Some have also been developed to tolerate colder temperatures. The most common cultivar is 'Silver Queen', which has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Most propagation of Aglaonema is done with cuttings and by dividing the basal shoots. Care of the houseplant involves protecting it from cold temperatures and excessive sunlight and removing any inflorescences that develop, which can prolong the life of the plant. It requires moist soil, and while some cultivars require a small amount of fertilizer, plants are easily injured when oversupplemented. Aglaonema are prone to false mites (Brevipalpus californicus). They may also acquire populations of nematodes, such as root- knot nematodes and Pratylenchus species, which cause root lesions.Conover, C. A., et al. Aglaonema Production Guide for Commercial Growers. Foliage Digest. Mid-Florida Research & Education Center. University of Florida IFAS. Pathogens include the fungus Myrothecium roridum and bacteria such as Pseudomonas cichorii, Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Xanthomonas campestris, which can all cause leaf spot. Colletotrichum fungi can cause anthracnose.Moorman, G. W. Aglaonema Diseases. Penn State Extension. The Pennsylvania State University. 2013. The NASA Clean Air Study determined that the species modestum of this plant genus was effective at removing common household air toxins formaldehyde and benzene. Aglaonema plants are poisonous due to calcium oxalate crystals. If ingested they cause irritation of the mucous membranes, and the juice can cause skin irritation and painful rash.Toxic Plants.

It was an effective example of inter-service and international co-operation. Background From the start of the war, the Allies had maintained a blockade against the import of seaborne goods to Germany. Although rich in many basic industrial materials, Germany, like Britain, could not produce some essentials. These included rubber, tin and tungsten. Until Germany invaded the Soviet Union it evaded the blockade via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Large quantities of materials were shipped by this route. After this was closed, German and Italian ships, stranded in Japan and Japanese-occupied Singapore, were used as blockade runners to bring in these essential goods to ports in occupied France. Although organised interdiction against these blockade runners was not set up until December 1943, the Allies intercepted and sank several ships in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Few ships managed successful runs. The operation Czechoslovak- crewed RAF Liberator attacked her The Royal New Zealand Navy light cruiser HMNZS Gambia joined the operation in December 1943, operating from Horta in the Azores. The Royal Navy light cruiser patrolled an area north of the islands. On 23 December aircraft from the United States Navy escort carrier sighted a suspected runner, and there were further reports of a flotilla of destroyers escorting another merchantman west from France. Gambia, Glasgow, and the light cruiser formed a cordon to intercept. Aircraft attacked the flotilla, now escorting a large incoming merchantman, the , and reported a hit and a near-miss on her. The light cruiser , minelayer and four Free French destroyers joined the patrol to intercept another runner. RAF Coastal Command aircraft acted in close cooperation. On 27 December at 1535 hrs Liberator GR Mk V heavy bomber of Coastal Command's Czechoslovak-crewed No. 311 Squadron RAF sighted a smaller blockade runner, the refrigerated cargo ship . The Liberator made a diving attack with eight wing-mounted SAP60 semi-armour piercing rocket projectiles, five of which hit the cargo ship above her waterline. The Liberator also dropped one bomb, and one 250 lb (115 kg) bomb one of which hit the ship aft of her funnel. The ship immediately caught fire. Alsterufer defended herself with anti-aircraft fire and rockets that released parachute cables. The Liberator's starboard outer engine was hit, but the aircraft successfully returned to base at RAF Beaulieu in England. Later that day two more RAF Liberators and four RAF Halifax heavy bombers attacked the ship, but claimed no hits. Alsterufer sank on the afternoon of 28 December. 74 members of her crew were rescued by four Canadian corvettes. Kriegsmarine destroyers and torpedo boats had set out to meet and escort Alsterufer in an operation codenamed Bernau. Now Glasgow and Enterprise sought to intercept them. Guided by shadowing aircraft, the cruisers intercepted eight destroyers early in the afternoon of 28 December and exchanged fire with them. Despite accurate German gunfire and torpedoes, effective German evading action and an attack with guided bombs by a Luftwaffe aircraft, the Royal Navy ships maintained contact. View from Z27 of T25 and T26 being shelled. Drawn by Hans Helmut Karsch, a German sailor, while interned in the Curragh Camp. (National Maritime Museum of Ireland) =Battle of the Bay of Biscay= The German ships divided into two groups and the cruisers pursued one of these. By 1600 hrs the s T25 and T26 and the Z27 had been sunk and one had escaped, damaged. About 62 survivors were rescued by Royal Navy minesweepers, 168 by a Irish coaster, , and four by Spanish destroyers. The blockade runner Osorno reached the Gironde but struck a wreck in the estuary. She was beached and subsequently unloaded offshore. Glasgow, Enterprise and Ariadne returned to Plymouth and Penelope to Gibraltar. More blockade runners from the Far East were expected, so the Gambia and the light cruiser patrolled north of the Azores for the next three days. Gambia then returned to Plymouth on 1 January 1944. Three more German ships were sunk between 3 and 5 January by US Navy patrols in the South Atlantic. These were the last German blockade runners. By Autumn, German armies were retreating out of France and the French ports were no longer open to Axis ships.

Peace Players International logo  Goals  PeacePlayers International has four main objectives: * Bridge social divides * Develop future leaders * Educate children to lead healthy, constructive lives * Build community involvement to ensure long-term sustainability  Background  PeacePlayers International was founded in 2001 on the premise that “children who play together can learn to live together.” PeacePlayers International effectively blends together proven theories of social modeling, conflict resolution and public diplomacy to operate basketball and life-skills programs in historically divided regions that bring together thousands of children from different religious, racial, and cultural backgrounds. The programs attract children to participate in basketball and life-skills activities that enable them to learn leadership skills and how to live as friends and neighbors. A key component to PeacePlayers International's effectiveness is that the programs target children aged 10–14. These are the children old enough to pick up the basics of the sport, but young enough that many prejudices have not yet been cemented. Through the power of sport and education and the strategic integration of public diplomacy, PeacePlayers International is altering the pattern of preconceived prejudice and equipping children with the skills and education needed to address the serious social and health issues they face. In 2017, NIKE partnered with Peaceplayers International to promote equality in communities across the United States through the power of sport.  South Africa  Since inception, PeacePlayers International - South Africa has: • Taught the game of basketball to over 25,000 children from the city of Durban, its suburbs and its surrounding townships • Actively involved 7,000 10- to 14-year-old boys and girls from 98 schools who participate in inter-community leagues, life skills clinics, tournaments and clubs • Trained and employed 100 young South African adults to serve as coaches and youth mentors • Built 45 outdoor basketball courts each of which is affixed with AIDS awareness message • Held eight tournaments each involving over 2,000 children who participate on mixed teams • Developed and implemented a program-wide HIV/AIDS Awareness initiative in partnership with Harvard University's School of Public Health and the University of Natal. • Become a registered charity in South Africa led by an active board of directors • Enlisted funding from the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, The Nelson Mandela's Children Fund, the South African government and several corporate sponsors Northern Ireland In August 2002, PeacePlayers International extended its program to Northern Ireland with the mission to use basketball to address sectarianism and foster mutual respect and tolerance among Catholic and Protestant children. PeacePlayers International - Northern Ireland (PPI-NI)'s programs include: * Primary School Twinnings – Entire classes of children in grades 5 and 6 (ages 8-11) from neighboring Protest and Catholic primary schools come together for basketball and community relations sessions in mixed groups. PPI – NI works regularly with 16 schools in all. Beginning in Fall 2010, PPI – NI began work with grade 4 students (ages 7-8). * Cross-Community League (CCL) – Children of all backgrounds ages 9-17 from community centers, clubs, churches and other youth groups come together for integrated basketball and community relations discussions in strategically located community centres. Activities occur in a structured, fun, and inclusive environment after school and on weekends. PPI – NI currently works with twelve community centres in Belfast. * Leadership Development Programme (LDP) – In partnership with the International Fund for Ireland, PPI – NI recruits 16- to 25-year-old young people with outstanding leadership potential for year-round leadership, life skills and community relations training, anchored by monthly workshops and quarterly residential retreats. * Developing Integrated Sports Clubs (DISC) – DISC aims to cultivate sustainable integrated multi-sport clubs in Northern Ireland. As a first step, PPI – NI has developed three Open College Network-accredited courses to help capacitate other sports organizations for community relations and peacebuilding work. * Tournaments - PPI-NI hosts three annual basketball tournaments for 9- to 13-year-olds each year: Spring Jam (spring time), Monster Mash (Halloween time), and Jingle Ball (Christmas time). On Wednesday 11 July 2007, David Cullen and Trevor Ringland received the Arthur Ashe award for Courage at the 2007 ESPY awards  Middle East  In June 2005, PeacePlayers International initiated a year-round program in Israel and the West Bank (PPI-ME) that facilitates positive dialogue and fosters tolerance and multiculturalism between Jewish and Arab youth and young adults. The program involves two main components. First, PeacePlayers International engenders meaningful interaction between Arab and Jewish children in Israel and the West Bank through joint basketball activities and life skills sessions which take place regularly throughout the entire school year. Second, PPI-ME operates a single identity program in the West Bank that provides constructive outlets for children and employment and leadership opportunities for young Palestinian adults. All initiatives are created with input from the local communities who work with PPI Program Directors and local coaches to build specialized programming. Since September 2005, PeacePlayers International - Middle East has: * Worked with more than 2,000 children * Trained and employed over 70 adults from both sides as coaches, mentors and leaders * Established sixteen joint basketball clubs that provide opportunities for regular interaction for Jewish, Israeli Arab and Palestinian children * Developed “BasketPal” programs in the West Bank cities of TulKarm and Ramallah * Implemented teambuilding and leadership activities into all programming Program Activities Include: * Twinned Basketball Clubs – a network of youth basketball clubs in which Israeli, Jewish,Israeli Arab and Palestinian children play together on integrated teams under the guidance of a diverse group of coaches. All players and coaches partake in weekly peace education workshops. * Leadership Development Program – youth leadership and training program that equips Israeli and Arab young adults with the skills needed to make a positive difference in their communities and on the lives of the children with whom they work. * “Basket Pal” – programs aim to build capacity and infrastructure in underprivileged areas of the West Bank. Weekly practice sessions and games provide constructive outlets for these at-risk children. PPI-ME trains young adults in these communities to serve as role models and mentors. * Camps – summer basketball camps in Israel at which children compete on mixed teams and participate in a variety of teambuilding activities and peace education workshops.  Cyprus  PeacePlayers International established a program in Cyprus (PPI-CY) in October 2006 that is using the game of basketball to facilitate positive dialogue and interaction between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot youth, with the ultimate goal being improved relations between the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus. The project is led by a group of 3 PeacePlayers International-Cyprus directors and 16 local coaches who direct activities that bring 10- to 12-year-old Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot youth together to play the sport in an inclusive, fun environment. The program was launched in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Working with the UNDP and other local partners, PeacePlayers International-Cyprus has the following objectives: * Bring hundreds of Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot children (aged 10–12) together to play basketball in a fun, inclusive environment * Train and employ local young adults from both communities to work together as coaches, leaders and role models * Develop links between Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot sports clubs and other community organizations * Build community involvement and investment  New Orleans  In the fall of 2007, PeacePlayers International is launching its first domestic program in New Orleans.

Philosophers Richard Brandt and Brad Hooker are major proponents of such an approach. For rule utilitarians, the correctness of a rule is determined by the amount of good it brings about when followed. In contrast, act utilitarians judge an act in terms of the consequences of that act alone (such as stopping at a red light), rather than judging whether it faithfully adhered to the rule of which it was an instance (such as, \\"always stop at red lights\\"). Rule utilitarians argue that following rules that tend to lead to the greatest good will have better consequences overall than allowing exceptions to be made in individual instances, even if better consequences can be demonstrated in those instances. Mill's formulation In his 1863 book Utilitarianism, John Stuart Mill defends the concept of rights in terms of utility: \\"To have a right, then, is, I conceive, to have something which society ought to defend me in the possession of. If the objector goes on to ask, why it ought? I can give him no other reason than general utility.\\" Whether Mill was a rule utilitarian is a matter of controversy. This passage from Utilitarianism seems to suggest that he was: > In the case of abstinences indeed—of things which people forbear to do from > moral considerations, though the consequences in the particular case might > be beneficial—it would be unworthy of an intelligent agent not to be > consciously aware that the action is of a class which, if practiced > generally, would be generally injurious, and that this is the ground of the > obligation to abstain from it. But Mill also argues that it is sometimes right to violate general ethical rules: > ... justice is a name for certain moral requirements, which, regarded > collectively, stand higher in the scale of social utility, and are therefore > of more paramount obligation, than any others; though particular cases may > occur in which some other social duty is so important, as to overrule any > one of the general maxims of justice. Thus, to save a life, it may not only > be allowable, but a duty, to steal, or take by force, the necessary food or > medicine, or to kidnap, and compel to officiate, the only qualified medical > practitioner. Other things being equal people are happier if their society follows rules so people know what types of behaviour they can expect from others in given situations. Therefore, utilitarians can justify a system that goes, \\"Keep to the rules unless there is a strong reason for breaking them.\\" Strong rule utilitarianism Strong rule utilitarianism (SRU) gives a utilitarian account for the claim that moral rules should be obeyed at all places and times. SRU does not deteriorate into act utilitarianism like weak rule utilitarianism, but it shares weaknesses with similarly absolutist moral stances (notably, deontological ones). A scenario (or thought experiment) used to clarify this problem (often attributed to Immanuel Kant) posits both # you know the location of some persons # a murderer asks you about their location in order to go and kill them. The moral convention is that lying is wrong, so the strong rule utilitarian says you should reveal their location. A more sophisticated SRU response is that # the above scenario is very improbable. # in the majority of situations, telling the truth leads to more trust and happiness. # if applied universally (à la Kant's categorical imperative), the rule against lying would create net utility. This position is most notably argued by John C. Harsanyi (in an essay included in \\"Utilitarianism and beyond\\", edited by A. Sen and B. Williams, Reprint 2010). Nevertheless, many disagree, claiming that (in this situation) telling the truth would result in needless death, would therefore be immoral, and that this scenario thus provides a counterexample contradicting SRU. Weak rule utilitarianism Weak rule utilitarianism (WRU) attempts to handle SRU counterexamples as legitimate exceptions. One such response is two-level utilitarianism; more systematic WRUs attempt to create sub-rules to handle the exceptions. But as David LyonsForms and Limits of Utilitarianism, 1965. and others have argued, this will necessarily tend to collapse into act utilitarianism. Rules will require as many sub-rules as there are exceptions, thus many exceptions will make the more-sophisticated rule computationally intractable. Rational agents will then satisfice that intractability by seeking outcomes that produce the maximum utility.Allen Habib (2008), \\"Promises\\", in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.

The area acts as a natural land bridge from South America to North America, which is important for species who use the bridge in migration. Due to the extensive unique habitat types, Mesoamerica contains somewhere between 7 and 10% of the world’s known species. The corridor was originally proposed in the 1990s to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting ecological sustainability. The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones, each with varying availability for human use.  Background  With the increasing conversion of natural tropical ecosystems to agricultural farms and for other human use, comes growing concern over conservation of local species. Mesoamerica is considered one of many biodiversity hotspots where extinction is a significant threat. This area is the world’s third largest biodiversity hotspot. Some efforts have been made to protect organisms in the region, however, many of these protected sites are “small, fragmented, isolated, or poorly protected” In the late 1980s, Archie Carr III envisioned a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife native to the region by connecting fragmented patches of habitat, and to create buffer zones to allow different levels of land use near protected areas. The corridor that eventually came to be, originally called Paseo Pantera (Spanish for Path of the Panther), follows the Atlantic coastline. A topographical map of the region encompassing the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, along the Atlantic coast, and Central American mountain ranges, along the Pacific coast. The MBC began in the late 1990s, by funding from the World Bank in order to promote wildlife conservation, particularly endemic, threatened, and endangered species, and ways to use the land in a sustainable fashion. It was developed by a team of biologists from the University of Florida and the Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD), and was remapped by CCAD, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for political reason. $4 million was invested in the corridor by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1990 to 1995. In 1992, all of the countries that are part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor joined the Central American System of Protected Areas (SICAP), which allows each country to “maintain its own ministries of the environment.” The corridor project has been successful in providing wildlife habitat; however, regional biota remained threatened due to fragmented areas and “unevenness of the region’s protected area system”  Ecosystems  The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor incorporates multiple diverse biomes and is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Splitting the corridor in half is the Guatemalan Mountain range, which includes active volcanoes. These environmental forces create four terrestrial biomes and 19 terrestrial ecoregions. The biomes include, tropical dry broadleaf forest, tropical wet broadleaf forests, xeric shrub lands, and tropical coniferous forests.  Land use  According to data from 2003, roughly 57% of the Mesoamerican biological corridor is natural vegetation, with the remaining land being used mostly for cattle and crop production. The main crops produced in the MBC include sugar cane, corn, coffee, and beans. With agricultural production being such a large part of all the nations economies, there is much emphasis on adopting sustainable agricultural practices. The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones, each with varying availability for human use. Core Zones are protected areas whose purpose is to promote and sustain biodiversity in the areas in order to maintain ecosystem services to the local people. Buffer Zones include the areas surrounding the protected Core Zones, which are made up mostly of wild land. Pathways between zones are labeled as Corridor (or Connectivity) Zones; these zones link water and land passages, allowing movement of plants and animals throughout the corridor. Finally Multi-use Zones, separate wild and protected land from land used for forestry, agriculture, and areas of direct human impacts. “Around 10.7% of Mesoamerica is currently under some category of protection for biodiversity conservation.”  Conservation efforts  The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is a program that “integrates protection areas into a single, functional conservation area”. Their goal is to promote “regional scale connectivity of protected areas with sustainable development and improvement of human livelihoods.” The purpose of the corridor is to emphasize the conservation movement as being a social and group effort. One issue with conservation efforts arise from the discontinuity of government and politics across the corridor; areas are often fragmented and up to 40% of protected areas go unenforced because it crosses nations barriers. The rapid increase in human population growth negatively affects conservation. Although this growth has been paired with rapid urbanization, the majority of the MBC population still resides in rural areas and “depends directly on biological resources for subsistence.” This dependency has led to exploitation that is difficult to quantify and regulate by the nations’ governments and conservation groups. As of 2010, SICAP (Central American System of Protected Areas) encompasses 669 protected areas that total 124,250 square kilometers. Yet, conservation efforts are hindered and negatively impacted by the fragmentation of land parcels and cross-national political differences and tension. Most of the protected areas are roughly 18,400 hectares, while only 18 areas exceeded 1,000 square kilometers. Presently, most conservation efforts are in promoting sustainable development and mitigating the damage done to the area by deforestation. Deforestation in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor peaked between the 1970s and the 1990s. Planting native trees is the main method of restoring ecosystems after deforestation.  Benefits  Due to the corridor having been recently developed there has not been any studies that specifically address the benefits. Future studies should be completed to examine the differences in animal populations prior to the corridor and after implementation.  Controversy  When the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor was in the planning process there was a lack of formal functions proposed. The stakeholders did not have a clear idea of what the exact functions of the MBC were, which led to anger and an increase in the time taken to implement the corridor. The MBC was originally conceived as a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife by connecting fragments of habitats and forming buffer zones to limit human land use. However, many of the interested stakeholders wanted to include common livelihood problems such as pollution, water and sanitation, pesticides contamination, firewood acquisition, zoonotic and infectious disease. It was finally decided that the main goals of the corridor would be to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting ecological sustainability. Indigenous people were barely involved in these decisions and the zone boundaries were made without their input. This lack of input led to distrust and tension between the locals and corridor implementers. In an effort to promote ecological sustainability, payment for various environmental services are given to landowners in order to motivate reforestation on their land. A major issue with these programs is that most small landholders do not have titles to the land. These small landholders were given plots to cultivate when they worked on larger farms or many were displaced migrants who settled in unclaimed lands. Since they have no legal documentation of land ownership they can’t apply for many of the correct land use incentives, thus little consideration of long-term effects on the land is given. Another issue is that the programs don’t differentiate between small- scale and large-scale landowners. In an effort to reduce Carbon emissions the MBC offers incentives for carbon sinks. Large-scale landowners have taken advantage of these systems by planting African Oil Palms on their lands. These plants provide them with more carbon credits whereas a small landowner who is maintaining forest will receive little to no carbon credits References Category:Central America Category:Ecology ","title":"Mesoamerican Biological Corridor"},{"id":"3401395","text":"Waterloo Road is a 1945 British film directed by Sidney Gilliat and starring John Mills, Stewart Granger, and Alastair Sim.

He is a frequent guest on talk shows and an outspoken critic of bias in television news.  Background  Born in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, Hack attended the Lynnewood School, and Haverford High School, on the Main Line in suburban Philadelphia. He later attended Pennsylvania State University and holds a master's degree in Environmental Design. Hack moved to Los Angeles where he was hired by TV Guide magazine as its West Coast national programming editor. By the early 1980s, Hack began writing the TeleVisions column for the daily entertainment trade paper, The Hollywood Reporter. During the next decade, Hack often appeared on The Tonight Show and Today reporting on Hollywood. During the same period, he was a frequent guest on Oprah Winfrey, Good Morning America, Larry King Live, Charlie Rose, Tomorrow, Entertainment Tonight, and Access Hollywood. In 1990, Hack left The Hollywood Reporter to become Vice President of Creative Affairs at Dove Audio and Entertainment, a production company that specialized in miniseries and books-on-tape. While at Dove, Hack adapted Sidney Sheldon’s The Sands of Time, Memories of Midnight, and The Stars Shine Down as mini-series, which he also produced, and wrote his first book, Next to Hughes with Robert Maheu. Since leaving Dove, Hack moved to a horse ranch in Maui, where he stabled polo ponies, and established a home on the Intracoastal in Florida. His bestseller Hughes: The Private Diaries, Memos and Letters was released on September 11, 2001. Hack was being interviewed live on the Today show by Matt Lauer when the first plane crashed into the World Trade Center, and Lauer consequently had to cut their interview short to report on the ongoing events. The abrupt ending of their interview and the early reports of the attack from the Today show, is shown in a continuous loop, as part of an exhibit in the National September 11 Memorial & Museum in New York City.

Financial Services Forum In 2005, Nichols was hand-picked to lead the non-partisan Financial Services Forum, which was at the time located in New York City. The forum represents 18 CEOs of America's largest financial firms, including banks, insurers, and asset managers. Nichols relocated the organization to Washington, D.C., and worked to raise its profile, educating the public about the importance of robust capital markets, encouraging a competitive global marketplace, and shaping the national and international regulatory dialogue. Time referred to the forum as \\"perhaps the country's most powerful trade association,\\"http://www.politico.com/morningmoney/0110/morningmoney54.html Nichols is frequently cited by the news media on capital markets and financial services issues. He was regularly quoted in publications such as The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, and frequently appears on CNBC, Fox Business Network and Bloomberg. He has testified on several occasions before the House Committee on Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, two key congressional committees that oversee the financial services industry. From 2009 to 2014, Nichols was recognized by The Hill newspaper as one of the most effective trade association leaders in Washington, D.C. The New York Times called Nichols \\"among the most powerful lobbyists in Washington,\\" in 2011. In November 2011, Nichols was included on The New Republic's list of Washington's most powerful, least famous people. In 2010, CEO UPDATE also named Nichols one of the year’s top trade association leaders. While he represented large financial institutions, Nichols also expressed concern for smaller community banks. In 2013, he wrote an op-ed for Politico stating: . During Nichols' tenure, the forum also co-chaired Engage China, a coalition of 12 financial trade associations pushing for greater access to Chinese markets for overseas firms and more financial liberalization in Chinese markets. American Bankers Association In May 2015, Nichols was named president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, the nation’s largest trade group representing banks of all sizes. During his tenure as CEO, several bills and regulatory proposals supported by ABA have been enacted, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the first major banking reform bill since the Dodd-Frank Act, the bipartisan Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (S. 2155). In 2019, Nichols was a vocal advocate for the SAFE Banking Act, which would allow banks to serve the cannabis industry. With ABA’s support, the legislation was passed by the House with a bipartisan vote in September 2019. Since Nichols’ arrival at ABA, the association’s push for “tailored regulation” and other refinements to the post-financial crisis regulatory framework has seen traction at regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC and CFPB. Nichols also reorganized ABA’s political engagement strategy, with the association producing ads endorsing congressional candidates for the first time—both Republicans and Democrats—and increasing its political activity in the 2020 campaign cycle. “Our goal is to support candidates who understand and appreciate the critical role banks of all sizes play in the economy,” Nichols said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “We plan to expand our efforts in 2020 on a rigorously bipartisan basis.” He made several key executive hires at ABA, including former managing director at JPMorgan Chase Naomi Camper as chief policy officer, former director for Freddie Mac’s single-family business Alethia Baggett as chief human resources officer, and former Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook as chief communications officer. The Washington Post has cited Nichols as one of a “new generation of trade group CEOs” taking an unconventional approach to lobbying to remake the image of trade associations.https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/11/04/new- generation-of-trade-group-ceos-take-more-aggressive-and-at-times-unorthodox- approach-to-lobbying/ Nichols has also been regularly named one of the \\"Top Lobbyists\\" by The Hill.http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/top- lobbyists/258316-top-lobbyists-2015-associations In November 2016, the association announced a new student debt repayment benefit for employees, something offered by only 4% of U.S. employers at that time. In 2018, ABA was recognized as a \\"Great Place to Work\\" by the company that produces Fortune magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For list. Nichols also announced ABA efforts to help banks innovate, including the association’s first direct investments in fintech companies. At ABA’s annual convention in 2018, he challenged large core processing firms to improve the services they provide to community banks, especially when it comes to implementing mobile banking, real-time payments and other services customers are demanding. As CEO, Nichols has increased participation of women in the ranks of ABA’s officers and executive staff. Within his first four years at the association, ABA elected the second and third women to chair the association in its 145-year history. As of 2019, the association had a female chief human resources officer, chief policy officer, general counsel, chief financial officer and senior adviser, five out of the association’s nine C-suite executive staff. Philanthropy Nichols is former vice chairman and a current board of governors member of Food Allergy Research and Education, a nonprofit group that supports scientific research and allergy-related advocacy. FARE helped support the School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act, which was signed in 2013.

Written for Christmas, it consists of eleven movements, with text from The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems, edited by Gerald Bullett. The text is principally in Middle English, with some Latin and Early Modern English. The piece was written in 1942 while Britten was at sea, travelling from the United States to England. The piece was written at the same time as Britten's Hymn to St. Cecilia and is stylistically very similar. Originally conceived as a series of unrelated songs, it was later unified into one piece with the framing processional and recessional chant in unison based on the Gregorian antiphon \\"Hodie Christus natus est\\", heard at the beginning and the end. A harp solo based on the chant, along with a few other motifs from \\"Wolcum Yole\\", also serves to unify the composition. In addition, the movements \\"This Little Babe\\" and \\"Deo Gracias\\" have the choir reflecting harp-like effects by employing a canon at the first in stretto. The original 1942 publication was written for SSA (Soprano, Soprano, Alto) children's choir. In 1943, an SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass) arrangement was published for a full choir. Many of the movements are written as rounds or call-and-response pieces – lyrically simple for the sake of the children performing. The SATB arrangement shows these origins quite clearly throughout many of the movements; this is most notable in Balulalow. There are three-part divisis in both the tenor and bass parts. Each of these lines individually mirrors a line in either the soprano or alto parts, as though the tenor and bass sections are a men's choir singing the original SSA composition with an SSA choir.  Movements  = 1. \\"Procession\\" (\\"Hodie Christus natus est\\", Gregorian antiphon to the Magnificat at Second Vespers of Christmas) = This movement is sung exclusively by the sopranos and is patterned on a traditional processional in Christian church service. It has no time signature and can be sung in a variety of tempos in order to make the movement more flexible. The last several measures can be repeated to allow the whole ensemble to take their places. > Text: Hodie Christus natus est: > hodie Salvator apparuit: > hodie in terra canunt angeli: > laetantur archangeli: > hodie exsultant justi dicentes: > gloria in excelsis Deo. > Alleluia! > = 2. \\"Wolcum Yole!\\" = An upbeat and festive piece intended to welcome the audience as guests coming to celebrate the holiday. The text of this piece is written in Middle English. At one point, all the parts come in at separate times to introduce each guest who has arrived for the holidays: the tenors begin by welcoming St. Stephen and St. John, the altos then welcome \\"the innocents\\" who are implied to be children (referring to the first-born children killed by Herod, observed on one of the feast days of the season), followed by sopranos welcoming Thomas Becket, and finally the basses welcome all the previously named guests. Text: Wolcum, Wolcum, Wolcum be thou hevenè king, Wolcum Yole! Wolcum, born in one morning, Wolcum for whom we sall sing! Wolcum be ye, Stevene and Jon, Wolcum, Innocentes every one, Wolcum, Thomas marter one, Wolcum be ye, good Newe Yere, Wolcum, Twelfthe Day both in fere, Wolcum, seintes lefe and dare, Wolcum Yole, Wolcum Yole, Wolcum! Candelmesse, Quene of Bliss, Wolcum bothe to more and lesse. Wolcum, Wolcum, Wolcum be ye that are here, Wolcum Yole, Wolcum alle and make good cheer. Wolcum alle another yere, Wolcum Yole. Wolcum! = 3. \\"There is no rose\\" (Trinity College MS 0.3.58, early 15c) = \\"There is no Rose\\" presents a more reverent tone than the previous movement, as the choir admires the beauty of the birth of Jesus Christ. The sopranos and altos sing the melody in a soft, prayerful manner, while the rest of the ensemble occasionally joins them to sing in unison. This is a macaronic piece, meaning the text is in both a vernacular language (English, in this case) and Latin. > Text: There is no rose of such vertu > As is the rose that bare Jesu. > Alleluia, Alleluia, > For in this rose conteinèd was > Heaven and earth in litel space, > Res miranda, Res miranda. > > By that rose we may well see > There be one God in persons three, > Pares forma, pares forma. > The aungels sungen the shepherds to: > Gloria in excelsis, gloria in excelsis Deo! > Gaudeamus, gaudeamus. > > Leave we all this werldly mirth, > and follow we this joyful birth. > Transeamus, Transeamus, Transeamus. > Alleluia, Res miranda, Pares forma, Gaudeamus, > Transeamus. > = 4. \\"That yongë child\\" = \\"That yongë child\\" consists of a soprano solo with harp accompaniment. The reverent tone from the previous piece carries over into this one, except this piece is more recitative. > Text: That yongë child when it gan weep > With song she lulled him asleep: > That was so sweet a melody > It passèd alle minstrelsy. > > The nightingalë sang also: > Her song is hoarse and nought thereto: > Whose attendeth to her song > And leaveth the first then doth he wrong. > = 5. \\"Balulalow\\" (the brothers Wedderburn, fl. 1548) = \\"Balulalow\\" includes the rest of the ensemble and acts as a contrast to the first part. It has a different key, rhythm, and an overall more jubilant tone than \\"That yongë child\\". \\"Balulalow\\" is meant to be a lullaby for baby Jesus Christ and the soprano solo at the beginning of the movement paints an image of The Virgin Mary singing a lullaby to her newborn child. > Text: O my deare hert, young Jesu sweit, > Prepare thy creddil in my spreit, > And I sall rock thee to my hert, > And never mair from thee depart. > > But I sall praise thee evermoir > with sangës sweit unto thy gloir; > The knees of my hert sall I bow, > And sing that richt Balulalow! > = 6. \\"As Dew in Aprille\\" (Sloane 2593, first quarter 15c) = \\"As dew in Aprille\\" switches the focus from baby Jesus Christ to the Virgin Mary. This is reflected in this gentle, soothing piece, which progressively grows softer until the very end. Throughout this movement, the different voice parts overlap each other to create an echoing effect. The volume of the choir abruptly shifts at the end from pianissississimo (very, very, very softly) to forte (loudly). > Text: I sing of a maiden > That is makèles: > King of all kings > To her son she ches. > > He came al so stille > There his moder was, > As dew in Aprille > That falleth on the grass. > > He came al so stille > To his moder’s bour, > As dew in Aprille > That falleth on the flour. > > He came al so stille > There his moder lay, > As dew in Aprille > That falleth on the spray. > > Moder and mayden > was never none but she; > Well may such a lady > Goddes mother be. = 7. \\"This Little Babe\\" (from Robert Southwell's \\"Newe Heaven, Newe Warre\\", 1595) = \\"This little Babe\\" contrasts with every other piece up to this point, taking a much darker approach and often using imagery of hell. This piece depicts a battle between the baby Jesus Christ and Satan (good and evil), which is conveyed in its swift tempo, polyrhythms, overlapping segments between the voices, and the fact that the song grows progressively louder over the duration of the movement. The song reaches its climax with an intense key change and conflicting rhythm from the rest of the piece. > Text: This little Babe so few days old, > Is come to rifle Satan’s fold; > All hell doth at his presence quake, > Though he himself for cold do shake; > For in this weak unarmèd wise > The gates of hell he will surprise. > > With tears he fights and wins the field, > His naked breast stands for a shield; > His battering shot are babish cries, > His arrows looks of weeping eyes, > His martial ensigns Cold and Need, > And feeble Flesh his warrior’s steed. > > His camp is pitchèd in a stall, > His bulwark but a broken wall; > The crib his trench, haystalks his stakes; > Of shepherds he his muster makes; > And thus, as sure his foe to wound, > The angels’ trumps alarum sound. > > My soul, with Christ join thou in fight; > Stick to the tents that he hath pight. > Within his crib is surest ward; > This little Babe will be thy guard. > If thou wilt foil thy foes with joy, > Then flit not from this heavenly Boy! > = 8. \\"Interlude\\" (harp solo) = This movement is performed halfway through the performance. The harp solo creates a sense of angelic bliss with its slow tempo, shifting rhythm, and progressively soft nature. = 9. \\"In Freezing Winter Night\\" (Southwell) = This movement calls out to the circumstances of the birth of Christ and employs the choir to sing in a round to create an echoing effect. The choir and harp progress through the movement at contrasting paces and, over the duration of the piece, gradually synchronise until they both move at the same pace just before the ending when the music fades out. This is meant to symbolise the discord on earth before and during the birth of Christ and the hope of the future and the harmony he brings. > Text: Behold, a silly tender babe, > in freezing winter night, > In homely manger trembling lies > Alas, a piteous sight! > > The inns are full; no man will yield > This little pilgrim bed. > But forced he is with silly beasts > In crib to shroud his head. > > This stable is a Prince’s court, > This crib his chair of State; > The beasts are parcel of his pomp, > The wooden dish his plate. > > The persons in that poor attire > His royal liveries wear; > The Prince himself is come from heav’n; > This pomp is prizèd there. > > With joy approach, O Christian wight, > Do homage to thy King, > And highly praise his humble pomp, > wich he from Heav’n doth bring. = 10. \\"Spring Carol\\" (16c., also set by William Cornysh) = \\"Spring Carol\\" is a duet between two sopranos that depicts the signs of spring. It originates from a carol set by William Cornysh. This movement ends with a call to thank God, which transitions appropriately to the next movement. > Text: Pleasure it is to hear iwis the Birdès sing, > The deer in the dale, the sheep in the vale, > the corn springing. > > God’s purvayance For sustenance. > It is for man. > > Then we always to him give praise, > And thank him than. = 11. \\"Deo gracias – Adam lay i-bounden\\" (Sloane 2593) = \\"Deo gracias\\" (Thanks be to God) is based on a macaronic (a mix of English and Latin) poem from the 15th Century. The original text tells of the events that happened in Chapter 3 of Genesis, the \\"Fall of Man\\" as Eve is tricked into eating the fruit of sin. Note the idea of Adam's sin as a 'happy fault,' emphasized by the last stanza - \\"Blessèd be the time That appil takè was\\" - introduced by St. Ambrose and St. Augustine and further developed by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. At the end of the piece, a cross can be displayed in the text to signify the crucifixion of Christ as well as the redemption of mankind. Britten has set the choir in such a way that the choir becomes emphatic in its thanks to God. Use of syncopated (emphasis of the off-beat to create a displacement of rhythm) and staccato (short and detached) rhythms emphasise this energetic thankfulness, while only a small section very quietly recounts the plight of humanity. The harp and choir both gradually grow more resounding until the very last chord. > Text: Deo gracias! Deo gracias! > Adam lay i-bounden, bounden in a bond; > Four thousand winter thought he not too long. > > Deo gracias! Deo gracias! > And all was for an appil, an appil that he tok, > As clerkès finden written in their book. > > Deo gracias! Deo gracias! > Ne had the appil takè ben, the appil takè ben > Ne haddè never our lady a ben hevenè quene. > > Blessèd be the time that appil takè was. > Therefore we moun singen. > Deo gracias! = 12. \\"Recession\\" (\\"Hodie Christus natus est\\") = This movement is a near mirror of the Procession and the ensemble, typically, performs this piece as they exit the stage. Its melody gradually fades as the ensemble retreats outside of the venue. > Text: Hodie Christus natus est, > hodie Salvator apparuit, > hodie in tera canunt angeli, > laetantur archangeli: > hodie exsultant justi dicentes, > gloria in excelsis Deo. > Alleluia!

His research and writings focus on Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), and cover the history of psychiatry and psychology from the mid- nineteenth century to current times. Shamdasani edited the first publication of Jung's major work: Liber Novus, The Red Book. Although its title had been well known for years, it was not until 2009 that its contents were revealed to the public and practicing psychotherapists.See below for source notes. Education and academic career He gained his BA from Bristol University in 1984, followed by an MSc in the History of Science and Medicine at University College London/Imperial College London. Later Shamdasani was awarded a Ph.D. in the History of Medicine from University College London's Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine.It is now called the UCL Centre for the History of Medicine. He then became a professor at the Institute.Nina Martyris, \\"Autobiography of a Soul\\" in The Times of India, Dec. 12, 2009.Cf., Sara Corbett, \\"The Holy Grail of the Unconscious\\" in The New York Times, Sept. 16, 2009. In a 2009 interview with the Times of India, Shamdasani gave this brief biographical note: > \\"I am a Sindhi, I was born in Singapore and grew up in England. I first > encountered Jung when I was travelling in India in my teens, looking for a > guru. The first work of his that I came across was his commentary to The > Secret of the Golden Flower, which was my first introduction to psychology. > I then saw the text as promising the possibility of a mediation between > Eastern mysticism and Western rationality.

This led me to the studying > the history of psychology\\".Nina Martyris, \\"Autobiography of a Soul\\" in The > Times of India, Dec. 12, 2009. In 2003 Shamdasani founded, along with Stephen Martin, the Philemon Foundation, which sought to publish all of Jung's works.Philemon Foundation, \\"About the Foundation\\".Sara Corbett, \\"The Holy Grail of the Unconscious\\" in The New York Times, Sept. 16, 2009. Although Jung's Collected Works had been published in twenty volumes, there were manuscripts and other works by Jung that remained unpublished.Shamdasani, Jung and the Making of Modern Psycholoby (2003), pp. 22-25. Shamdasani commenced and continues now his labors at Philemon as the foundation’s General Editor.Philemon Foundation website, \\"Scholars\\". Currently (2016) Shamdasani serves as a professor in the School of European Languages, Culture, and Society (SELCS) at University College London,Prof. Sonu Shamdasani page at SELCS, UCL. and is also Director of the UCL Centre for the History of Psychological Disciplines.Philemon Foundation website, \\"Scholars\\". The Red Book By 2000 Shamdasani had arranged to begin work editing Jung's The Red Book. In 2003 he stepped in as Editor of the Philemon Foundation's successful project to publish, in 2009, this much awaited volume.C. G. Jung, The Red Book. Liber Novus (2009), p. iii and iv (title and copyright pages). With others Shamdasani also worked on the translation (\\"Tranlators' Note\\", pp. 222-224). Although Jung had worked on the writing and the designs for it between 1914 and 1930, he did not then have it published.C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (New York: Random House 1961, reprint Collins 1963), pp. 180, text and Aniela Jaffé's note, regarding the unfinished Red Book.Deirdre Bair, Jung.

In 1959 Jung added a short Epilogue to his Red Book, commenting on his 'confrontation with the unconscious' that started prior to World War I: \\"It could have developed into [madness] had I not been able to hold the overpowering force of the original experiences. ... I knew of nothing better than to write them down... and to paint the images that appeared when reliving it all--as well as I could.\\"C. G. Jung, The Red Book (2009), Epilogue, p. 360 (quote, drawing from two translations).Shamdasani, Jung Stripped Bare by his Biographers, Even (2005), p. 102 (same Red Book quote in different translation, with commentary). Shamdasani describes Jung's unusual work, an illustrated volume of calligraphy, as \\"the book that stands at the center of his oeuvre\\" which \\"has long been recognized as the key to comprehending\\" Jung. The Red Book \\"was at the center of Jung's self-experimentation.\\"Shamdasani, 'Introduction' to The Red Book (2009), at pp. 193 (quotes), 221 (quote). His introduction is entitled \\"Liber Novus: The 'Red Book' of C. G. Jung\\".C. G. Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections (1961, 1963), p. 181. Jung gave up finishing 'the aesthetics' of the Red Book, a fruit of the unconscious. He did so \\"in favor of a rigorous process of understanding\\" that would constitute his psychology, and provide the \\"needed firm ground\\" for the imagination and vision of the Red Book. \\"I had to draw concrete conclusions from the insights the unconscious had given me--and that task was to become a life work.\\" Earlier Shamdasani stated: > \\"If one does not place Jung's confrontation with the unconscious in a proper > perspective, or understand the significance of the Red Book, one is in no > place to understand fully Jung's intellectual development from 1913 onwards, > and not only that, but his life as well: it was his inner life which > dictated his movements in the world. ... For Jung's work on his fantasies in > Black Books and the Red Book formed the core of his later work, as he > himself contended. The Red Book is at the center of Jung's life and work. > [Understanding Jung] without an accurate account of it would be like writing > the life of Dante without the Commedia, or Goethe without Faust.Shamdasani, > Jung Stripped Bare by his Biographers, Even (2005), pp. 102-103 (quote), cf. > p. 118. Jung's heirs had for many decades held the original manuscript of the Red Book in a bank vault for safe-keeping.The hand-written manuscript, its source in Jung's Black Books, and transcriptions of it held by different people, are listed and discussed by Shamdasani in his \\"Editorial Note\\" to The Red Book (2009), pp. 225-226. They withheld its publication and declined offers to do so. During the 1990s Shamdasani's research, however, had uncovered the existence of text from the Book outside the family's control. Another transcription was found by Marie-Louise von Franz. It was demonstrated that Jung had sent a copy of his manuscript to a publisher. Shamdasani entered into delicate negotiations with Jung's descendants in Zürich and, in May 2000, obtained their agreement \\"to release the work for publication\\".Shamdasani, 'Introduction' to The Red Book (2009), 220-221 (Jung heirs, von Franz, agreement; quote). After his several studies of Jung, followed by his years editing and translating the Red Book, Shamdasani has acquired a special competence (cf. his 'Introduction' pp. 193-221).Sara Corbett, \\"The Holy Grail of the Unconscious\\" in The New York Times, Sept. 16, 2009. Discussed are the publication of The Red Book, the Philemon Foundation, the concerns of the Jung family, and Prof. Shamdasani's role and his work on The Red Book. Shamdasani was then teaching at the Wellcome Trust Center for the History of Medicine at University College London.Nina Martyris, \\"Autobiography of a Soul\\" in The Times of India, Dec. 12, 2009.

The Alliance places a particular emphasis on defusing tensions between the Western and Islamic worlds. The initiative was first proposed by the President of the Government of Spain, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) in 2005. It was co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. On July 14, 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan formally announced the launch of the Alliance of Civilizations at the United Nations Headquarters in New York with the co- sponsorship of the Governments of Spain and Turkey. On 10 November 2009, the United Nations General Assembly recognized the mandate of the Alliance of Civilizations by adopting resolution A/RES/64/14 “The Alliance of Civilization,” acknowledging the importance of intercultural and interreligious dialogue in promoting tolerance and expressing its continuous support for the work of the Alliance of Civilizations. On 6 July 2015, Member States demonstrated their support for the work and achievements of the Alliance of Civilizations and adopted by consensus General Assembly resolution A/RES/69/312 “United Nations Alliance of Civilizations,” hence affirming the status of the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations (UNAOC) as an initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General, an entity within the United Nations system.  Inception  The group claims that mutual suspicion, fear and misunderstanding between Islamic and Western societies has been increasing since the beginning of the new millennium. The heightened instability of coexistence between these groups of people with divergent backgrounds has led to exploitation by extremists throughout the world: the severest form of this being violent acts of terrorism. It has been the opinion of many political leaders that efforts should be made to reach a common ground between diverse ethnic and religious groups based on the tolerance, understanding, and respect of the fundamental set of values and beliefs of each group. In this way, and by the attempt to quell \\"extremism\\", a comprehensive coalition can be established to work toward peaceful coexistence between diverse groups around the world, and thereby support international stability. = Proposal = The Alliance of Civilizations initiative was proposed by the President of the Spanish Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero at the 59th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2005. It was co-sponsored by the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.For Turkey's role and motivations, see, Ali Balcı, and Nebi Miş, \\"Turkey’s Role in the Alliance of Civilizations: A New Perspective in Turkish Foreign Policy?\\" Turkish Studies 9.3 (2008): 387-406 The aim of the initiative was to produce actionable, time-bound recommendations by the end of 2006 for UN member states to adopt. = Preliminary work = To fulfill the objective of the initiative, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan assembled a High-Level Group (HLG) consisting of 20 eminent persons drawn from policy making, academia, civil society, religious leadership, and the media. A full range of religions and civilizations were represented.Secretary-General Announces Composition Of High-Level Group For Alliance Of Civilizations Among the members were former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami, who proposed the Dialogue Among Civilizations initiative, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South African Nobel laureate, Prof. Pan Guang, who obtained the Saint Petersburg-300 Medal for Contribution to China-Russia Relations, and Arthur Schneier, who is the founder and president of the “Appeal of Conscience Foundation” and who gained the \\"Presidential Citizens Medal”. The HLG met 5 times between November 2005 and November 2006, and produced a report prioritising relations between the Western and Muslim societies. The first meeting of the HLG of the AoC occurred in Spain in November 2005. The second meeting was in Doha, Qatar from 25 to 27 February 2006 with the agenda of aiming to find ways to calm the cartoon crisis between West and Islamic world.\\"Alliance of Civilizations and the AKP\\" http://www.radikal.com.tr/ek_haber.php?ek=r2&haberno;=6425 The third meeting took place in Dakar, Senegal from 28 to 30 May 2006. At the final meeting in November 2006 in Istanbul, the members presented their final report to Kofi Annan and to Prime Ministers José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The report outlined recommendations and practical solutions on how the Western and Islamic societies can solve misconceptions and misunderstandings between them. According to the report, \\"politics, not religion, is at the heart of growing Muslim-Western divide\\", although a large emphasis is maintained on religion.Microsoft Word - 061113 AoC High level Group press release.doc = Report of the High-Level Group = The High-Level Group’s report, published on 13 November 2006, put forth recommendations that became the guiding principles for the implementation of the Alliance. In particular, it identified four priority areas of action for the Alliance of Civilizations, which all play a critical role in reducing cross-cultural tensions and building bridges between communities, and to which the Alliance of Civilizations should bring a multidisciplinary and multi-perspective approach: Youth, Education, Media, and Migration.  Structure and leadership  The \\"High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations\\" is the title of the primary leadership position of UNAOC, who is to function as political facilitator and lead spokesman, and to consult directly with the United Nations Secretary General. In April 2007, the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed the position of High Representative to Jorge Sampaio, former President of Portugal. In February 2013, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser assumed the post of High Representative, succeeding President Sampaio in the position. In January 2019, he was succeeded by Mr. Miguel Ángel Moratinos, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain. The Secretariat of the Alliance of Civilizations provides support to the High Representative and implements developmental functions of the AoC. The offices are based at the United Nations headquarters in New York.  Ongoing activities  = Implementation plan = In May 2007, UNAOC released its \\"Implementation Plan 2007-2009\\", which elaborated on the notion that the AoC will not replace or reconstitute any existing plans or political channels. Rather, the AoC will facilitate its goals primarily through partnership operations among a variety of existing groups, and also through projects in youth, education, media, and migration. The core of the 16 page document consists of two parts. The first part, drawing directly on the 2006 HLG report, describes the strategic and structural framework for the AoC. Included are plans for an AoC forum held in varying locations annually, the \\"Group of Friends\\" representatives from States and international organisations, and UN Secretary-General-appointed ambassadors to the AoC. Financing will be accomplished via the AoC Voluntary Trust Fund with support from various organisations. The second part of the plan calls for actions to staff the office of the Secretariat by Summer 2007, and to implement the directives established in the first part of the document. A mid-term review of the plan of action is intended in 2008. The first group of ambassadors will be listed by the end of 2007, and the first annual AoC forum will be held January 15–16 in 2008 in Spain, with a focus on youth. The AoC will establish a rapid-response media-based mechanism to intervene in escalations of global tension. The plans were discussed with UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon on June 14, 2007. On June 24, Ban Ki-moon spoke at a commemoration of 13th century Muslim poet Rumi in New York, in which he embraced the teachings of the poet, expressing the resonance with the goals of the AoC.Secretary-General Says Commemoration Of Poet Maulana Rumi Can Motivate Work Of United Nations Alliance Of Civilizations, Ensure Its Ultimate Success  Priority Areas and Ongoing Projects  = Media = Traditional and new media play a crucial role in influencing public perception, narratives, and attitudes and therefore hold the potential to bridge cultural divides. With the advent of the web and a plethora of new news sources, social media, blogs, and other websites run by citizen journalists, UNAOC media projects focus on building the critical media literacy skills required to receive the ever- increasing speed and volume of information, and on training journalists so they can do their work to the best of their abilities. = Youth = Young people are critical agents for social change, economic growth, development and technological innovation. It is crucial to recognize youth not only as a source of mobilization, but as autonomous actors and partners. They are our most important pool of talent, ideas, energy, and passion. Through education, training, and many other opportunities for innovation and creativity, UNAOC empowers youth globally and recognize them as powerful agents for social change. = Education = Education systems today face the challenge of preparing young people for an interdependent world that is unsettling to individual and collective identities. Education about one’s own history fosters a sense of community and solidarity, but it must be balanced by knowledge of global issues and an understanding and appreciation of other societies and cultures. Education in its various forms – including music, sports, art, drama and film – can help build bridges between communities and people. Through its Education programmes, UNAOC enables citizens to acquire intercultural competencies and critical thinking skills to help foster cross- cultural dialogue and overcome cultural stereotypes and intolerance. = Migration = Virtually every state is both a country of origin and of destination for migrants. In a world of porous borders, rapidly evolving modes of transportation and communications, and globalized economies, diverse populations are destined to interact. This phenomenon presents new challenges that need to be addressed, but also opportunities that need to be harnessed. With its Migration programmes, UNAOC addresses the many facets of migration with the goal of fostering inclusive societies that respect the human rights of all. = Women as Peace Mediators = The new High Representative Mr. Moratinos intends to propose adding “women as peace mediators” to the areas of focus of UNAOC. Integral to the vision of the United Nations Secretary General on prevention is the inclusion and women’s empowerment in their fullest sense. He has committed to integrate gender perspectives in mediation efforts dispatching women leaders as mediation envoys. = UNAOC Projects and Initiatives = * UNAOC Youth Solidarity Fund * UNAOC Fellowship Programme * UNAOC Young Peacebuilders * Intercultural Innovation Award (IIA) * Intercultural Leaders and Alumni Engagement (in partnership with BMW Group) * #SpreadNoHate Initiative * PLURAL+ Youth Video Festival (in partnership with IOM) * PEACEapp * Media and Information Literacy  UNAOC Global Forums  In its 2006 report, the UNAOC High-Level Group recommended that UNAOC organize a recurring Global Forum under United Nations auspices to provide a regular venue for representatives of governments, international organizations, civil society, and the private sector to forge partnerships and to express commitments for action. UNAOC convened its first Global Forum in Madrid, Spain in 2008. Since then, it has organized seven additional Global Forums in Istanbul, Turkey (2009); Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (2010); Doha, Qatar (2011); Vienna, Austria (2013); Bali, Indonesia (2014); Baku, Azerbaijan (2016); and at the United Nations Headquarters in New York (2018). * 2018 Forum: UN Headquarters, New York * 2016 Forum: Baku, Azerbaijan * 2014 Forum: Bali, Indonesia * 2011 Forum: Doha, Qatar = 2010 Forum: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil = Leaders speaking at the 2010 Forum On 27–29 May 2010, a network of over 2,000 political and corporate leaders, civil society activists, youth, journalists, foundations, and religious leaders gathered in Rio de Janeiro, under the theme \\"Bridging Cultures, Building Peace,\\" for the third United Nations Alliance of Civilizations' forum. The theme of the conference set out key questions for the participants to discuss over the course of the three-day forum, these included: * What kind of actions do we need to combat intolerance and prejudice? * What tools do children and young people need to navigate an increasingly complex and multicultural world? * What is the impact of globalization on people’s sense of belonging and identity? * How do economic inequalities impact on relations among diverse communities? * How can the media help bridge cross-‐cultural divides and change perceptions of the other? * How can we create inclusive societies, founded on the respect for human rights and diversity? Towards the conclusion of the Third Forum of the Alliance, the outcomes were announced by Jorge Sampaio, the High Representative of the UN Alliance of Civilizations and former President of Portugal. The results presented the commitments of all participants to the existing initiatives, as well as new ones, such as the inauguration of the first two Dialogue Cafés, which uses the latest video conferencing technology to connect young people in different parts of the world; the first conference of the Global Youth Movement; the creation of the United Nations University International Institute for the Alliance of Civilizations; and launching of the Online Community on Migration and Integration in partnership with the International Organization for Migration. = 2009 Forum: Istanbul, Turkey = The second Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations was held in Istanbul, Turkey on April 6–7, 2009.\\"The Second Forum of the Alliance of Civilizations\\" – AoC website. thumbalt=A Jorge Sampaio, the UN High Representative for the Alliance of Civilizations, speaking at the 2009 Istanbul Forum From 6–7 April 2009, nearly 2,000 participants—among them several Heads of Government. over 50 ministers, as well as policymakers, foundations, media and grassroots leaders from around the world—convened at the Çırağan Palace Hotel in Istanbul, Turkey, to forge new partnerships, generated ideas aimed at building trust and cooperation among diverse communities and advance the Civilizations' goals. The Forum also served as an opportunity to take stock of initiatives developed by the Alliance, to showcase practical projects in collaboration with civil society and corporate partners and to launch new programs. The results of the forum emphasized the commitment of the Alliance to the existing initiatives, as well as new ones, such as the Education about Religions and Beliefs; Alliance Fellowship Program; Dialogue Cafe; PLURAL +; Restore Trust, Rebuild Bridges; Mapping Media Education Policies in the World: Visions, Programs and Challenges; and the Alliance of Civilizations Research Network. The Alliance also was able to establish partnership agreements with seven international networks, such as the International Organization for Migration, the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the Ibero-American General Secretariat, the Anna Lindh Foundation, Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries and the Union Latine. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, who was visiting Istanbul that day, was originally expected to attend the second day of the meeting,\\"Obama set for packed schedule on Turkey visit\\", Today's Zaman, March 21, 2009, but paid a surprise visit to the U.S. troops in Iraq instead.The President Speaks to the Troops, The White House Blog, Tuesday, April 7th, 2009. = 2008 Forum: Madrid, Spain = The first forum of the Alliance of Civilizations was held in Madrid, Spain on January 15–16, 2008. It was attended by over 900 participants in 89 official delegations from 78 countries.\\"The First Forum of the UN Alliance of Civilizations\\" – AoC website. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan (Left), Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon (Center), and Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (Right) The forum was hosted by the Government of Spain, and it convened leaders, activists, scholars, and public figures from every region of the world in an effort to find new ways to bridge the growing divide between nations and cultures, and to establish new partnerships to promote global understanding. Over one and a half days, political leaders including heads of State and Government; Ministers and senior officials; civil society activists and Nobel laureates; corporate executives; religious leaders; and leading scholars dialogued and debated with each other, launched practical initiatives and made commitments to action aimed at improving relations across regions and cultures. Among the results were the announcement of a number of initiatives concerning media, educational and other programmes to advance AoC objectives in various countries, and the signing of Memoranda of Understanding with UNESCO, the League of Arab States, ISESCO, the Arab League Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (ALECSO), and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), and a Letter of Intent with the Council of Europe.\\"Major outcomes of the Alliance of Civilizations Forum\\" – AoC website.

The Obrovac municipality has a total population of 4,323 people. The town is located in the canyon of the river Zrmanja. Demographics The total population is 4,323, distributed in the following settlements: * Bilišane, population 176 * Bogatnik, population 131 * Golubić, population 132 * Gornji Karin, population 1,125 * Kaštel Žegarski, population 135 * Komazeci, population 42 * Krupa, population 127 * Kruševo, population 1,112 * Muškovci, population 100 * Nadvoda, population 170 * Obrovac, population 996 * Zelengrad, population 77 Geography Zrmanja River near Obrovac Obrovac is a town on the Zrmanja River some 11 km from the mouth of the river of the Novigrad sea. Above the town are the ruins of a fortified city. Its tributary Krupa attracts numerous day-trippers, and in recent times, rafting, canoe, and kayak lovers. Not far from the town of Krupa is a monastery with a valuable icon collection. About north-west of the town, along the road heading up to the mountains, lies a huge deserted industrial complex, an alumina plant built in the 1970s. History Ruins of Fortica Fortress Obrovac first got its name in 1337. In 1527 Obrovac was taken over by the Ottoman Turks. In October 1683, the population of Venetian Dalmatia, principally Uskoks of Ravni kotari, took arms and together with the rayah (lower class) of the Ottoman frontier regions rose up, taking Skradin, Karin, Vrana, Benkovac and Obrovac. In 1687, Stojan Janković, a Morlach leader, forced the Ottomans out of Obrovac. The municipality's population peaked at 13,498 in the 1971 census. In the 1970s and 1980s, due to a low living standard in the area, Obrovac was significantly affected by emigration. According to the 1991 census, shortly before the start of Yugoslav Wars, 65.5% of population were Serbs.

In 2003, Datt was offered the portfolio of Minister for Special Education, the Disabled and National Library Services, together with 13 other FLP parliamentarians who were offered cabinet positions by the Prime Minister, Laisenia Qarase but the FLP refused to accept this offer.PM announces 14 FLP Ministers On 12 December 2005, Datt announced that he would retire from politics at the parliamentary election scheduled for 2006, but on 14 March 2006, said that he had changed his mind at the request of his party. In the election duly held on 6–13 May, he won the Nasinu Indian Communal Constituency with an overwhelming majority, and was subsequently appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Labour and Employment Opportunities, one of nine Ministers from the FLP in Laisenia Qarase's multi-party cabinet.

It was destroyed in 1945 and is now known only from black-and-white photographs and enhanced color reproductions. Style Caravaggio was known for painting very realistically, using models instead of standard convention and idealization.Spear, “Caravaggio,” 141. He made his figures lifelike and relatable, as opposed to portraying unrealistic or phony poses. In this instance, however, the patrons wanted an idealization of the beloved Saint, someone who its viewers could admire and strain to be like. They did not want a bumbling peasant who looked as if he just walked in off the street. With the angel sweeping down and the Saint's stool teetering in movement, it is arguably one of Caravaggio's earliest examples of his dynamic style.Thomas, “Expressive Aspects of Caravaggio,” 642. It was a much more exciting composition than the first. Even though Caravaggio changed the composition to suit the desires of the patron, you can still see his own style under the more refined subject of Saint Matthew. History Saint Matthew and the Angel was completed in 1602. A part of the collection of the former Kaiser Friedrich Museum, it was destroyed by fire at the end of World War II while stored in an anti-aircraft bunker in Berlin. This work, by a pillar of the Baroque movement, might have provided new information about the artist and patron. Reproductions of the original still survive. Commission Saint Matthew and the Angel was created as a commission for the Contarelli Chapel. Caravaggio was previously commissioned to paint two scenes of the saint's life, and after the patrons were satisfied with them, a third was commissioned. The Contarelli Chapel was dedicated to Saint Matthew. With funds left for its building left in 1585, it was completed in 1600. Cardinal Del Monte played a major part in orchestrating the decoration of its interior, and was the one who suggested Caravaggio as the painter of the scenes of Saint Matthew's life. The altar was to be composed of two Caravaggio paintings as well as a statue of the saint by Flemish artist Jacob Cobaert.Hess, “Contarelli Chapel,” 197. However, the church was not pleased with the statue and Caravaggio was re-hired to do another piece as the center for the altar, to show Saint Matthew writing the Gospel under the guidance of an angel. Caravaggio depicted the Saint as an unlearned peasant, gaping in the presence of the angel. The church rejected Caravaggio's irreverent presentation of the saint, and Caravaggio replaced it with a more glorifying image, The Inspiration of Saint Matthew, which remains in the Chapel today. Comparison The comparison is not perfect because the only images available of the lost Saint Matthew and the Angel are black and white photographs that were taken before World War II. The lost painting showed Saint Matthew as poorly groomed, with dirty feet. Although this was the style of Caravaggio, the church leaders thought it was too crude and did not want to have what looked like a peasant hanging in their sacred altarpiece. In addition, they thought that this Matthew did not match the other two paintings that Caravaggio had already done. It was apparently disconnected and therefore had no place with the others. The second piece keeps true to the same subject, but with a few changes. Matthew looks more like the other two Matthews in the altar. The Saint is now more serious and in control in the presence of the angel. Instead of being fully controlled by the angel, Saint Matthew is only encouraged by the angel in the second one. He is working more on his own accord.

It stars Tom Poston, Julia Meade, Jim Backus, Fred Clark, and Cecil Kellaway. The plot is about a man obtaining magical powers from a god of an ancient civilization. It is based on Walter Karig's 1947 novel. Plot A brilliant but peculiar professor of Ancient Eastern languages, Jonathan Jones, finds that an amulet sent to his niece Cynthia by a boyfriend from an archeological dig has magical powers. Whoever has the amulet in their possession can 1) cause great pain by pointing at another living creature, 2) cause time to go into slow motion by saying the word \\"Zotz!\\", or 3) cause instant death by simultaneously pointing and saying \\"Zotz!\\". Both government and Communist agents immediately develop an interest in the amulet's possible military use. (This is a metaphor for the age of nuclear weapons, as the novel was written two years after atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki). In the meantime, Jones and rival professor Kellgore are both in line for a promotion to take over from retiring Dean Updike as head of this California university's language department. A new colleague and possible romantic interest, Professor Fenster, is startled by Jones' behavior, particularly at a party thrown by Updike's wife that turns into chaos. Cast * Tom Poston as Professor Jonathan Jones * Julia Meade as Professor Virginia Fenster * Jim Backus as Professor Kellgore * Cecil Kellaway as Dean Updike * Margaret Dumont as Persephone Updike * Fred Clark as General Bullivar Promotion During the initial theatrical run, theater patrons received a full-size plastic replica of the amulet as a promotional item. In color, size and design, the replicas were essentially identical to the film amulet, with the additional feature of a small hole drilled at the top, for a key chain.

History  Jackson had formed Jackson Heights, while Davison formed his own band, Brian Davison's Every Which Way. After their fourth and final album Bump 'n' Grind (1973), Jackson Heights were looking for another keyboard player on tour, so Lee Jackson approached Patrick Moraz to ask him if he would be interested to join. Moraz proposed to form a new band instead, and with drummer Brian Davison, who was in The Nice with Jackson. The three then signed to Charisma Records, and developed a tight sound by practising up to eight hours each day. Refugee supported the album with a tour. Refugee recorded their only studio album, Refugee (1974), at Island Studios in London. The music was composed by Moraz, with lyrics from Jackson.

While circulation is heaviest in the Twin Ports metropolitan area, delivery extends into northeastern Minnesota, northwestern Wisconsin, and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The paper has a limited distribution in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The News Tribune has been owned by Forum Communications since 2006. Publication and ownership history The present incarnation of the Duluth News Tribune is the outcome of the merger and takeover of several earlier publications. Duluth's first weekly newspaper, The Duluth Minnesotian, was first published by Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, an editor of the St. Paul Minnesotian, on April 24, 1869. After a year of The Duluth Minnesotian publishing unfavorable articles about city services and local politics, Duluth's Mayor Joshua Carter and local investor Jay Cooke invited the owner of Superior, Wisconsin's Superior Tribune to move his paper across the canal to Duluth. This owner, Robert C. Mitchell, published the renamed Duluth Tribune on May 4, 1870. The Duluth Tribune was soon renamed the Duluth Daily Tribune. Meanwhile, The Duluth Minnesotian merged with another local newspaper, the Duluth Weekly Herald, to become The Duluth Minnesotian- Herald in 1875, later dropping \\"Minnesotian\\" to become an evening paper, The Duluth Herald. The first News-Tribune was created as a result of the merger of the Duluth Tribune and another daily paper, the Duluth News in 1892. In 1929, this morning paper was purchased by The Duluth Herald. Ridder Publications, later renamed Knight Ridder Inc., bought both papers in 1936. The pair were merged in 1982 to form the News-Tribune & Herald, shortened simply to Duluth News-Tribune in 1988. In 2000, the hyphen was omitted, leaving Duluth News Tribune as the paper's title. In 2006, The McClatchy Company purchased Knight Ridder Inc., acquiring the Duluth News Tribune in the process. The McClatchy Company decided to sell 12 of Knight Ridder's 32 daily newspapers, including the Duluth News Tribune and Minneapolis' Star Tribune, due to a company acquisition philosophy limiting purchases to \\"newspapers in fast-growing markets.\\" Forum Communications, a Fargo-based media firm, announced the purchase of the News Tribune on June 7, 2006. Forum Communications publishes a number of newspapers in the region, including The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, the Rochester Post Bulletin and the Grand Forks Herald.

He received the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and DPhil from Balliol College, Oxford. Career and research Dewar was appointed to the Chair in Chemistry at Queen Mary College of the University of London in 1951. He moved to the University of Chicago in 1959 and then to the first Robert A. Welch research chair at the University of Texas at Austin in 1963. After a long and productive period there, he moved to the University of Florida in 1989. He retired in 1994 as Professor Emeritus at the University of Florida. He died in 1997.List of IAQMS members Dewar's reputation for providing original solutions to vexing puzzles first developed when he was still a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oxford. In 1945, he deduced the correct structure for stipitatic acid, a mould product whose structure had baffled the leading chemists of the day. It involved a new kind of aromatic structure with a seven-membered ring for which Dewar coined the term tropolone. The discovery of the tropolone structure launched the field of non-benzenoid aromaticity, which witnessed feverish activity for several decades and greatly expanded the chemists' understanding of cyclic π-electron systems. Also in 1945, Dewar devised the then novel notion of a π complex, which he proposed as an intermediate in the benzidine rearrangement. This offered the first correct rationalisation of the electronic structure of complexes of transition metals with alkenes, later known as the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model. In the early 1950s, Dewar wrote a famous series of six articles on a general Molecular orbital Theory of Organic Chemistry, which extended and generalised Erich Hückel's original quantum mechanical treatments by using perturbation theory and resonance theory, and which in many ways originated the modern era of theoretical and computational organic chemistry. Following Woodward and Hoffmann's suggestion of selection rules for pericyclic reactions, Dewar championed (concurrently with Howard Zimmerman) an alternative approach (which he erroneously felt had been pioneered by M. G. Evans) to understanding pericyclic reactivity based on aromatic and antiaromatic transition states. He did not however believe in the utility of Möbius aromaticity, introduced by Edgar Heilbronner in 1964, and now a flourishing area of chemistry. He is known most famously for the development in the 1970s and 1980s of the Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods, MINDO, MNDO, AM1 and PM3 that are in the MOPAC computer program, and which for the first time enabled the quantitative study of the structure and mechanism of reaction (transition state) of many real (i.e. large) systems. This was illustrated in 1974 by computing (using the technique of energy minimisation) the structure of a molecule as large as LSD (with 49 atoms) at a quantum mechanical level (the calculation taking several days of the then state-of- the-art supercomputer time, a CDC 6600). It is worth noting that in 2006, the equivalent calculation takes less than 1 minute on a personal computer. In 2006, the same structure computation can now be completed using high-level ab initio or density functional procedures in less than two days, and semiempirical programs can be used to optimise the structures of molecules with perhaps 10,000 atoms. He was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science. =Awards and honours= His accolades include: Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1966); Member of the National Academy of Sciences (1983); Honorary Fellow, Balliol College, Oxford (1974); Tilden Medal of the Chemical Society (1954); Harrison Howe Award of the American Chemical Society (1961); Robert Robinson Medal, Chemical Society (1974); G.W.

The Olympian started in 1860 as The Washington Standard, a weekly paper. It was founded by John Miller Murphy, and its first issue was released on November 17, 1860. The paper became The Daily Olympian in February 1889 when it began publishing daily. Many people in Olympia still refer to The Olympian by its former name, or as \\"The Daily O.\\" The Daily Olympian and another Olympia newspaper, The Daily Recorder, merged in 1928. The Daily Olympian moved from its original home, on Legion Way and Washington Street, to the Capitol Press Building at the corner of Capitol Way and State Avenue. The Gannett Company purchased The Daily Olympian in 1971 and shortened its name to The Olympian in 1982. The Olympian moved to its current location at 111 Bethel Street in 1972. In September 2005, The Olympian was traded by Gannett Company, Inc., along with the Bellingham and Boise newspapers, to Knight Ridder in exchange for the Tallahassee Democrat. The Olympian now shares much of its operations—including printing—with The News Tribune, a McClatchy newspaper located in Tacoma. However, the newspaper's editor and reporters still work out of the Olympia office on Bethel Street.

Founding Founded in 1879, it was locally owned until being purchased by Capital Cities in 1978. The Times Leader, a morning broadsheet, is currently in a circulation battle with another Wilkes-Barre daily newspaper, The Citizens' Voice. Early history On November 27, 1907, the Wilkes-Barre Times printed a notice that it and the Wilkes-Barre Leader, both afternoon dailies, would merge, creating The Times Leader with the first newspaper to be dated Monday December 2, 1907. The Times Leader, in the heart of coal country, was subject to a very bitter strike that began October 6, 1978. Over 200 union employees walked off the job in defiance of what they viewed as union busting tactics by the Times Leader's new corporate owner, Capital Cities. The four striking newspaper unions began to publish the Citizens' Voice as a strike paper. Eventually the four unions were decertified. The Voice continued publication. This in turn prompted competition and created the unusual environment where Wilkes-Barre, with its population of a little more than 43,000, now has two competing dailies. The Times Leader was steadily returned to its position of prominence as the leading daily in Luzerne County, both in editorial quality and paid circulation. After the strike began, Capital Cities persuaded a young, dynamic editor, Richard L. Connor, to become publisher. During his eight years running the newspaper, Connor and his staff dominated the state's newspapers with awards for writing,reporting, and photography. The paper also became among the most prominent corporate citizens. The Times Leader became known around the country as a growth platform for young journalists, photographers, and newspaper executives. Connor moved on to restore the Fort Worth Star Telegram to strength as the Texas economy faltered in the mid-80s. His successor as publisher, Dale A. Duncan, became publisher of the Pontiac, Michigan, Oakland Press, and then publisher of The Indianapolis Star. Duncan was followed by Mark Contreas who worked in several executive capacities with the Pulitzer Company before become head of the newspaper division for Scripps. Capital Cities and the Times Leader were purchased by The Walt Disney Company in 1996. Disney in turn sold the Times Leader to Knight Ridder in 1997. The newspaper continued to prosper under Knight Ridder ownership. It started publishing a half-dozen zoned weekly sections for different parts of metro Wilkes-Barre, affectionately called the \\"Baby Leaders.\\" It also actively battled the Hazleton Standard-Speaker in southern Luzerne County with a heavily staffed bureau and daily zoned metro section. Recent history The McClatchy Company acquired 32 Knight Ridder newspapers, including the Times-Leader, in March 2006. However, McClatchy quickly announced that it would resell a number of papers, including the Times Leader. On June 26, 2006, McClatchy announced its sale of the Times Leader to Connor and investors including Frank Henry, Charles Parente, and HM Capital Partners, a Texas equity fund that seeks \\"investment opportunities in middle- market, cash generative businesses that have strong competitive positions with significant value creation opportunities.\\" A handful of unidentified local business owners also acquired ownership stakes. In 2007, to celebrate its 100-year anniversary, the Times Leader engaged in a circulation-building initiative in which it agreed to donate some proceeds to local charities. The newspaper staff was recognized for its editorial quality with numerous awards this year both in the state Associated Press competition and at the Keystone Press Awards. Behind its dynamic writers and photographers the Times Leader has gone on to win more Keystone Press Awards than any daily newspaper in the Wyoming Valley area.Keystone Press Awards The Wilkes-Barre Publishing Company—parent to the Times Leader— purchased a Spanish-language newspaper, El Mensajero, in late 2007. It was the dominant Spanish-language newspaper in Northeastern Pennsylvania. El Mesajero folded in August 2011.Times Leader publisher resigns , Citizens Voice, October 29, 2011 The Times Leader grew its paid circulation by 1,500 daily subscribers and 1,300 Sunday subscribers for the first four months of 2008, again outpacing the industry. For the six months ending September 30, 2011, the Audit Bureau of Circulations put the TimesLeader's average daily paid circulation at 38,059 (M-S) and 59,273 (Sunday). In 2011, the Wilkes-Barre Publishing Company reorganized into Impressions Media, with a strong focus on digital media. The company soon won a W3 Award for efforts in mobile media technology. Later that year, publisher Richard L. Connor stepped down as publisher of the Times Leader, but remained an investor. In 2012, Impressions Media was acquired by the private equity firm Versa Capital Management. Versa later merged its newspaper holdings into Civitas Media. In 2019, Civitas Media sold the Times Leader to Avant Publications, a joint venture of Champion Media and MIDTC.

Bilal has commercially released four albums to critical success, and his unreleased but widely leaked second album Love for Sale also found wide acclaim among critics and listeners. He was a member of the Soulquarians, an experimental black music collective active from the late 1990s to early 2000s. He has been well received, both nationally and internationally, with an extensive list of collaborations including Kendrick Lamar, Common, Erykah Badu, Jay-Z, Beyoncé, Guru, Kimbra, J Dilla, Robert Glasper, and The Roots. In August 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, Bilal wrote and recorded his first EP, VOYAGE-19, over the course of three days and in collaboration with various musicians in remote experimental sessions, which were streamed live on YouTube. The resulting three-track EP was released digitally the following month, with revenues of its sale and accompanying donations given to the participating artists, many of whom had been struggling financially due to the pandemic. Early life Bilal was born as Bilal Sayeed Oliver in Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He grew up in a religiously mixed household, his mother being Christian and his father Muslim. When he was 11 he became choir director at his mother's church, and at 14 he formed a group and performed gigs at the Blue Moon Cafe in Philadelphia. Bilal attended The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. He attended and Graduated from the High School for Creative And Performing Arts (CAPA) in 1998. Career =1999–2001: Beginnings with the Soulquarians and 1st album= Bilal began to familiarize himself with the music scene in New York City, meeting prominent recording artists such as Common, The Roots, and Erykah Badu from the Soulquarians collective. Eventually, he was discovered by Aaron Comess from the Spin Doctors during an after-school jam session. It was with him that Bilal recorded his demo and eventually landed a record deal with Interscope Records. In 2001, Bilal released his debut album 1st Born Second, which featured contributions from the Soulquarians as well as high-profile producers such as Dr. Dre and J Dilla. The album peaked at number 31 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, and it has sold 319,000 copies.Herrera, Monica. Bilal To Release Electro-Jazz Rock Album In 2010. Billboard.

The album showcased a wide variety, from the emotionally charged fan-favorite \\"Soul Sista\\", which peaked at No.18 on the Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Songs charts, to the political viewpoints of \\"Fast Lane\\" and \\"Second Child\\". Bilal managed to gain a sizable following and high attendance at his live shows, as well as much acclaim and respect from his peers, many of whom noted his range and ability to sing in a freeform style, and his classically trained falsetto. The soulful feel of the album caused Bilal to be labeled as \\"neo-soul\\". Bilal stresses that this term does not fit, and throughout his career, his expansion in music and pushing of boundaries proved his point. =2001–2011: Love for Sale saga and Airtight's Revenge = A38 concert hall in Budapest, 2008 In the following years Bilal continued to appear on projects by other artists of both high profile and avant garde, while recording and developing his follow-up set to be released on Interscope Records and featuring contributions primarily from producers Dr. Dre and J Dilla. These plans proved to be changeable and the final result, Love for Sale, was an album that appeared to be built around Bilal's own musicianship. Bilal switched it up on Love For Sale, which includes live instrumentation and a vibe completely new and different from its predecessor. Bilal's anticipation for the album was shot down, however, after receiving disapproval from Interscope. Unwilling to start from scratch, Bilal continued to push his LP. However, near the album's completion, the album was leaked in its entirety on the Internet. Interscope shelved the album indefinitely, hinting that it saw little commercial potential in it. The event sent Bilal into a period of distress, and he was considering quitting music; however, Love for Sale received over half a million downloads on the Internet, and Bilal began touring, despite there not being a proper release of the album. His concerts were known for being intense and inspiring awe among audiences. In 2008, Bilal began recording for his next album. After nine years without a properly released album, Bilal made a comeback on September 14, 2010, with Airtight's Revenge, a sophomore LP released under independent record label Plug Research. Bilal describes it as a retrospective: an album that explores his experiences and things he has learned since his last release. An experimental album, Airtight's Revenge blends jazz, hip-hop, electronic, rock, soul, and blues into one raw, genuine collection of music. The album's single, \\"Little One\\", earned Bilal a nomination a 2011 Grammy Award nomination in the category of Best Urban/Alternative Performance. That year, he also contributed as a guest performer to the Roots' Grammy-nominated album Undun (2011) and the Robert Glasper Experiment's Grammy-winning Black Radio (2012). =2012–2019: Further independent albums and guest projects = Bilal (center right) at the 2011 Stockholm Jazz Festival in Sweden In 2012, Bilal revealed plans for a new album under a new label, eOne Music.[EXCLUSIVE] Bilal Finds New Label, New AttitudeEntertainment & Culture.

On Billboard, the album debuted at No.17 on the Independent Albums Chart, No.19 on the R&B; Albums Chart, and No.103 on the Billboard 200, ranking higher than its predecessor, Airtight's Revenge. The album also received numerous high reviews, including an 8/10 from SPIN magazine, 4.5/5 stars from Allmusic, and 4/4 stars from USA Today. In between albums, Bilal appeared on albums by a variety of recording artists, including Kimbra, Otis Brown III, Kat Dahlia, and Slum Village. His guest contributions to Kendrick Lamar's third album To Pimp a Butterfly (2015) helped create buzz for Bilal's fifth album, In Another Life, released in 2015 to critical success. In an essay on the Soulquarians published that year, Michael A. Gonzales traces the collective's impact to Bilal's contemporary contributions: \\"Listening to Kendrick Lamar's newest album To Pimp a Butterfly, Bilal has transformed himself into an arty Nate Dogg for the post-Soulquarian generation that includes Robert Glasper, Esperanza Spalding and, now, Kendrick. Also writing that year, Exclaim! journalist Kevin Jones said, \\"Bilal's years spent in career limbo feel like a relatively minor blip in the wake of the many artistically ambitious personal releases and guest projects the uncompromising singer has managed to string together in recent years.\\" In 2019, Bilal contributed to Philip Bailey's single \\"We're a Winner\\", a recording of the Impressions' 1967 song of the same name. Bailey said of Bilal, who sang guest vocals and appeared in the music video: \\"Bilal was one of those singers who uses his [voice] like an instrument. And he's very explorative with his vocal [range]. He's played and he sang on things with more jazzy guys, too. I thought that our voices — obviously having those falsettos — would complement one another. And with that one, we actually sent him the files. I wasn't even in the studio with Bilal when he did his stuff.\\" = 2020: Live-streamed EP amid pandemic = In August 2020, over the course of a three-day weekend, Bilal live streamed his creation of an experimental three-song EP for HighBreedMusic, a Brooklyn recording studio and digital music channel. He wrote, recorded, and produced one song each day, totaling 54 hours, in collaboration with producer Tariq Khan and 30 other musicians, including Erykah Badu, Robert Glasper, Tone Whitfield, Khemist, Simon Mavin (of Hiatus Kaiyote), Keyon Harrold, Madison McFerrin, Marcus Strickland, Yahzarah Sinclair, Raymond Angry, Ben Williams, Brandee Younger, Big Yuki, Melanie Charles, Marcus Gilmore, and Louis Cato. Each participant worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stream simultaneously showed the EP's artwork being made, with a group of three visual artists enlisted for each song, including Angelbert Metoyer and Shanina Dionna. The EP was available to be pre-ordered during the weekend of the live stream, with sales and optional donations given to the participating artists, a number of whom were in financial difficulties because of the pandemic. On September 6, it was released on Bandcamp as a three-track digital download titled VOYAGE-19, for a price of $6.99, the profits of which were also distributed among the participants.

It is on the bank of the Jhelum River downstream from Srinagar, the state capital. The city was earlier known as Vārāhamūla. The name is derived from two Sanskrit words, Vārāha (meaning wild boar) and Mūla (meaning root/origin). The city is located on the banks of river Jhelum at the highest point of the river. The river forms a delta just in the outskirts of the city. Origin The name Baramulla is derived from the Sanskrit Varāhamūla (वराहमूल), a combination of varaha (boar) and mūla (root or deep) meaning \\"boar's molar.\\" According to Brahmin Mythology , the Kashmir Valley was once a lake known as Satisaras (Parvati's Lake in Sanskrit). Ancient Hindu texts relate that the lake was occupied by the demon Jalodbhava (meaning \\"originated from water\\") until Lord Vishnu assumed the form of a boar and struck the mountain at Varahamula. This created an opening for the water to flow out of the lake. The modern Baramulla was called Varahamulaksetra or Varahaksetra in the ancient days. Originally, it was a suburb of Huviskapura (modern Ushkur). Associated with the Adivaraha, the boar incarnation of Visnu, it was considered very sacred. Consequently, many temples and monasteries were built in the 9th and 10th centuries, during the region of Lalitaditya Muktapida, (Queen) Sugandha, and Ksemagupta, when the cult of Visnu flourished there. History =Ancient and medieval= This general view of the unexcavated Buddhist stupa near Baramulla, with two figures standing on the summit, and another at the base with measuring scales, was taken by John Burke in 1868. The stupa, which was later excavated, dates to 500 CE. The city of Baramulla was founded by Raja Bhimsina in 2306 B.C. A number of visitors have traveled to Baramulla, including Xuanzang from China and a British historian named Moorcraft. Additionally, Mughal emperors were fascinated by Baramulla. Gateway of the Kashmir Valley, Baramulla was a way station during their visits to the valley. In 1508 A.D., Emperor Akbar, who entered the valley via Pakhil, spent several days at Baramulla. According to Tarikh-e-Hassan, the city was decorated during Akbar's stay. Emperor Jahangir stayed at Baramulla during his visit to Kashmir in 1620. From the beginning, Baramulla has had religious importance. Hindu Teertha and Buddhist Vihars (monasteries) made the city sacred to both Hindus and Buddhists. During the 15th century, it became important to Muslims as well. Syed Janbaz Wali, who visited the valley with his companions in 1421, chose Baramulla as the center of his mission and was later buried there. His shrine attracts pilgrims from throughout the valley. In 1620, the sixth Sikh Guru, Shri Hargobind, visited the city. In Baramulla Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists, and Sikhs lived in harmony and contributed to its culture. Baramulla was the oldest and most-important town in northern Kashmir and Jammu (princely state) and \\"Gateway to the Kashmir Valley\\" (by the Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road) until 27 October 1947. It was ceded to India when the Maharajah signed the instrument of accession on 26 October 1947. The city is the headquarters of the Baramulla district. =October 1947= Pashtun tribesmen from the South Waziristan region of Pakistan attacked Kashmir to invade the state. They moved along the Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road on 22 October 1947. They were assisted by Pakistani soldiers in civilian clothes. Muzaffarabad was occupied on 24 October 1947, and the soldiers captured Baramulla the following day. Satrina village in baramulla, Ichama and Atna village in Budgam were chosen by Indian Sikhs to fight off the invaders.It’s was because of Sikhs, the invaders were not able to reach and capture Srinagar airport on time and their delay helped Indian army Patiala regiment to land and push the tribals back.Some Hindus alleged that the some rogue tribals molested and killed Christian Missionary Nuns and nurses at St Joseph's Hospital on their way to Srinagar airport. According to Tariq Ali, the local cinema became a \\"rape center\\", with atrocities continuing for several days. On the morning of 27 October, India airlifted troops from Delhi to the Srinagar airfield while the tribal forces were still at Baramulla, harassing and looting the people.  Reports  Aastair Lamb wrote in Incomplete Partition, Roxford 1997, pp. 186–187: > The (tribal) leaders completely lost control over their men, an orgy of > killing was the result. This was certainly the case at St Joseph's College, > Convent and Hospital, the site of what was to become one of the most > publicised incidents of the entire Kashmir conflict. Here nuns, priests and > congregation, including patients in the hospital, were slaughtered; and at > the same time a small number of Europeans, notably Lt. Colonel D.O. Dykes > and his wife, an Englishwoman preparing to leave the hospital that day with > her new-born baby, Mother Teresalina, a twenty-nine-year-old Spanish nun who > had been in Baramulla only a few weeks, as well as Mother Aldertrude, the > Assistant Mother Superior, and one Mr Jose Barretto, husband of the doctor, > met their deaths at tribal hands. Charles Chevenix Trench wrote in The Frontier Scouts (1985): > In October 1947... tribal lashkars hastened in lorries – undoubtedly with > official logistic support – into Kashmir... at least one British Officer, > Harvey-Kelly took part in the campaign. It seemed that nothing could stop > these hordes of tribesmen taking Srinagar with its vital airfield. Indeed > nothing did, but their own greed.

The Mahsuds returned home in a > savage mood, having muffed an easy chance, lost the loot of Srinagar and > made fools of themselves. Sam Manekshaw (later a field marshal) was a colonel in the Directorate of Military Operations who went to Srinagar with V. P. Menon to assess the situation on 26 October 1947. He later told in an interview: > Fortunately for Kashmir, the tribals were busy raiding, raping all along. In > Baramulla they killed Colonel D.O.T. Dykes. Dykes and I were of the same > seniority.

Tom Cooper of the Air Combat Information Group wrote, \\"The Pathans appeared foremost interested in looting, killing, ransacking and other crimes against the inhabitants instead of a serious military action.\\" According to Mohammad Akbar Khan (Colonel, Pakistan army, who was promoted as Brigadier and made in charge of sending the tribals to Kashmir and who had been a contemporary of Col. Dykes at Royal Military College, Sandhurst) in his War for Kashmir in 1947, \\"The uncouth raiders delayed in Baramulla for two (whole) days .\\" Biju Patnaik (later Chief Minister of Odisha) piloted the first plane to land at Srinagar airport that morning. He brought 17 soldiers from the 1st Sikh Regiment, commanded by Lt. Col. Dewan Ranjit Rai. The pilot flew low over the airstrip twice to ensure that no raiders were around. Instructions from Prime Minister Nehru’s office were clear: If the airport was taken over by the enemy, they were not to land. Taking a full circle, the DC-3 flew at ground level. Soldiers peered from the aircraft and found the airstrip empty. The raiders were too busy distributing the war booty among themselves in Baramulla. Lt. Col. Dewan Ranjit Rai immediately moved with his small platoon towards Baramulla hoping to stop the tribal raiders at the mouth of the funnel which opens 5 km east of Baramula into a wide valley. He led his men from the front and died of bullet wound the same day, 27 October 1947, at Patan but delayed the raiders for a day. As more Indian troops flew into Srinagar the next day, they started pushing the raiders back. It took two weeks for the Indian army to evict the raiders (who had been joined by Pakistani regulars and were well-entrenched) from Baramulla on 9 November 1947. Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah spoke to the UN Security Council on 5 February 1948: \\"The raiders came to our land, massacred thousands of people — mostly Sikhs, but Hindus and Muslims, too — abducted thousands of girls, Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims alike, looted our property and almost reached the gates of our summer capital, Srinagar.\\" Robert Trumbull, New York Times, 10 Nov 1947; reporting from Baramulla [UN doc # S/PV.762/Add.1/Annex 1/No. 26]: The raid of the convent is narrated in even gory details by Father Shanks, one of the fortunate survivors and the anonymous 'witnesses' in the following report. \\"The tribesmen - great, wild, black beasts they were - came shooting their way down from the hills on both sides of the town. They climbed over the hospital walls from all sides. The first group burst into a ward firing at the patients. A 20 year old Indian nurse, Philomena, tried to protect a Muslim patient whose baby had just been born. She was shot dead first. The Patient was next. Mother Superior Aldetude rushed into the ward, knelt over Philomena and was at once attacked and robbed. The Assistant Mother, Teresalina, saw a tribesman point a rifle at Mother Aldetrude and jumped in front of her. A bullet went through Teresalina's heart. At the moment Colonel Dykes, who had assured us we would not be attacked, raced from his room a few yards along the terrace to get the Mother Superior out of danger, shouting at the tribesmen as he ran. But the Mother Superior fell shot, and Colonel Dykes collapsed beside her with a bullet in the stomach. Mrs Dykes ran from her husband's room to help him. She too was shot dead. While this went on, Mr Gee Boretto, an Anglo-Indian, was killed in the garden before nine Christian Nuns. Then the nuns were lined up before a firing squad. As the tribesmen raised their rifles a young Afridi Officer, who once studied in a Convent School at Peshawar, rushed in and stopped them. At least there are living features of human quality in these incidents. He had been told his men were raiding a Convent, and had run all the way from the town. That saved all our lives by a few seconds. We did not find Mrs Dykes until the following day. She had been thrown down a well.\\" Father Shank of the Convent [UN doc # S/PV.762/Add.1/Annex 1/No. 27]: \\"Their buses and trucks, loaded with booty, arrived every other day and took more Pathans to Kashmir. Ostensibly they wanted to liberate their Kashmir Muslim brothers, but their primary objective was to riot and loot. In this they made no distinction between Hindu, Sikhs and Muslims. The raiders advanced in Baramulla, the biggest commercial centre of the region with a population of 11,000 until they were only an hour away from Srinagar. For the next three days they were engaged in massive plunder, rioting and rape. No one was spared. Even members of the St. Joseph's Mission Hospital were brutally massacred.\\" \\\\- 'Half Way to Freedom' by Margaret Bourke-White Andrew Whitehead, who was BBC correspondent in India, reported on the October 1947 atrocities in Baramulla, particularly on the Christian mission convent and hospital, in his book \\"A Mission in Kashmir\\".https://www.andrewwhitehead.net/full-text-a-mission-in-kashmir.html =Recent years= The road network has been improved in Baramulla since 1947, and better educational facilities have been created. Bridges on the Jhelum River have been built (or are planned) to connect the old town on the north bank of the river with the new town on the south bank. Urban renewal in the old town has been attempted by moving residents to the new town. Uptown Baramulla is a developed locality with shopping complexes and posh housing colonies. Baramulla is connected by rail with Srinagar, Anantnag, Qazigund and Banihal. Geography Baramulla is on the Jhelum River, at its highest point. Baramulla tehsil is stretched from Village Khushalpora in the east to village Boniyar in the west. The old town is on the north bank of the river, and the new town is on the south bank. They are connected by five bridges, including a suspension bridge connecting Gulnar Park and Dewan Bagh. Five more bridges are being built or are planned. A bridge will connect the Khanpora and Drangbal areas of the city. The old town is densely populated and smaller than the new town. Government offices, hospitals, the bus station and most other facilities are in the new town. The railway station is on the eastern end of the new town, on the river. Beyond the old town, the river divides into two channels at Khadanyar (near police headquarters), forming an island known as Eco Park. Baramulla is located at 34.2° N 74.34° E . It has an average elevation of 1,593 meters (5,226 feet).

Trago Mills (often known simply as Trago) is a chain of four department stores in south Cornwall and south Devon in England, and South Wales. It owns a site with an amusement park and some independent businesses, adjoining the store near Newton Abbot. Three are in town outskirts: Liskeard in Cornwall; Newton Abbot in Devon, and Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. Another is in Falmouth, Cornwall. The company emphasises cheapness and variety of stock. Background The chain was established by businessman Mike Robertson who bought the Liskeard site in the early 1960s after leaving a career in the RAF. Sites The company's buildings at Liskeard and Newton Abbot were designed by Charles Hunt of St Neot, Liskeard, whom they appointed in 1978. The buildings have a castle-inspired profile, with white towers and black-framed windows. Trago also experimented with smaller stores, such as a 'Trago Mini Mart'. =Liskeard= Some of the political statues outside the Liskeard store The first Trago Mills store was at Liskeard and started life as a small shed, selling items founder Mike Robertson had bought on trips to larger towns some distance away. The current Liskeard store, five miles west of the town just off the A38, has several acres of parkland and lakes, with several other local businesses on the site. There are statues at the entrance. One of them is of Attorney General Sir Michael Havers QC. MP, reciting . =Newton Abbot= The Newton Abbot site is the largest of the four and covers over of land. It has several independent businesses. A garden centre, the largest in the south west, was opened on the site in 2009, followed in 2010 by a new restaurant. In October 2004, a large fire broke out in the main building of the branch. Thirty fire appliances and over 200 fire fighters tackled the blaze, the largest to occur in Devon for several years. Buildings involved were completely rebuilt. In summer 2016, Trago2Clear, a clearance outlet for all Trago products closed. On 28 September 2016, demolition took place of the Old Clearance Shed and former Sarah's Pantry Cafe. A new £3million DIY and Trade centre opened in summer 2017. Trago Family Fun Park The Newton Abbot store has a leisure park attached, called the Trago Family Fun Park. This was opened shortly after the construction of the permanent store buildings and now covers over . Its features are: *Bickington Steam Railway, a 10¼-inch gauge railway that runs from the centre of the leisure park to the front car park, loops round three lakes, then returns to the 'Leisure Central' station. *The OO gauge Trago Mills Model Railway which was completed in 1988 after one year of construction by a team of 18 people. Measuring , at the time of its completion it was the largest model railway in the UK. *Go-karts, an indoor skate rink, trawler boats, speedboats, Swan pedal-boats, bumper boats, a shooting gallery, remote-control trucks and boats, picnic area and an animal park. *By the park are small shops, cafés and restaurants. Local produce includes fish and chips and fresh fudge. =Falmouth= The Falmouth store, near the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, is the smallest of the four. =Merthyr Tydfil= After owning a former factory site in Merthyr Tydfil in South Wales for nearly a decade, work began on the new shopping centre in autumn 2016. The site's multi-million pound store has 17 small towers. The store opened in April 2018. Controversies and legal disputes Statues of local political figures and officials the owner believed were opposed to his development \\"welcome\\" shoppers to the Liskeard store. One source of opposition may have been that planning permission did not always precede building work Robertson's local newspaper advertisements resulted in three newspapers carrying the adverts being successfully sued for libel by Sir Edward Heath, when some of his comments became highly personalised. Robertson placed advertisements in the 1980s and 1990s calling for the castration of gay men. The United Kingdom Advertising Standards Authority ruled against Trago Mills and demanded the withdrawal of all advertisements in 1998. Trago still occasionally runs inflammatory copy within their ads, one entitled \\"For any cash strapped Moslems reading this…\\" appeared in the Falmouth Packet in 2009 to promote a book by senior UKIP official David Challice. With his son and successor, Bruce, Robertson supported Eurosceptic political parties, most recently the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP). Robertson threatened to refuse to stop using imperial measures in his stores, attributing UK metricisation to the European Union (Trago today sells goods in metric quantities, sometimes with imperial equivalents, in line with the law). He remains opposed to speculative immigration from Eastern Europeans. Robertson supports job-specific immigration, more liberally than some in UKIP. In January 2007, the Mid Devon Star suggested this was hypocritical, as his large Newton Abbot site employed around 30 Polish people. In September 2011, the company was fined £199,588 after admitting five breaches of the Environmental Protection Act. This followed the discovery of several thousand tonnes of dumped waste, including asbestos, at its Newton Abbot and Liskeard sites. The fine was reduced to £65,000 in January 2012, after an Exeter Crown Court judge accepted that Trago Mills had paid nearly £500,000 in clean-up costs. In 2014, Trago Mills was featured on BBC's Fake Britain, after local trading standards discovered fake top-brand shampoo on sale in store. Trago management said that the product had been purchased from a reliable source and they had worked closely with local trading standards to ensure that the product was taken off sale once it had been identified as a fake. In June 2018, following the opening of the company's store in Merthyr Tydfil, some locals threatened to boycott the shop after Robertson criticised bilingual education and described bilingual English and Welsh signage as \\"visual clutter\\". Trago Mills Ltd (Aircraft Division) The FLS Sprint seen here at the fly-in at Bodmin Airfield, 3 May 2008. In the early 1980s, Trago Mills elected to design and build its own aircraft that could be sold to the British military as a trainer to replace the then ageing \\"Bulldog\\" fleet. The result was the Trago Mills SAH-1, which first flew on 23 August 1983. Passed over by the armed forces, the rights to the design have since changed hands several times, the latest version being the FLS Sprint.

His landscapes of both sacred and secular themes strongly anticipate the landscape painting traditions of the 17th century.Scarsellino (Ippolito Scarsella), Nymphs at the Bath at the Minneapolis Institute of Art Life Nymphs at the Bath Ippolito Scarsella was born and died in Ferrara. His father was the lesser-known painter Sigismondo Scarsella, who was particularly skilled as an architect. Scarsellino traveled and worked extensively across Italy, encountering many influences.Veronique Damien, Quatre nouveaux tableaux génois de Strozzi, Castiglione, Piola et Baciccio, Galerie Canesso, Paris, 2013, p. 8-11 He lived in Venice for four years around 1570. The exact date is not known. He reportedly trained in Venice in the studio of Veronese. Scarsellino worked alongside the brothers Carracci in the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara. As can be observed from their works, the Ferrarese artist and the Bolognese painters exhibited a reciprocal influence upon one another. To name just one of many examples, Ludovico Carracci's 1616 Martyrdom of Saint Margaret for the Church of San Maurizio in Mantua, takes its inspiration from the Ferrarese reformists earlier version of five years prior, for the Oratory of Saint Margaret in Ferrara.Ugo Ruggeri. \\"Scarsellino.\\" Grove Art Online.

He often painted the same subject with variations, in a range of different formats and supports. His early works show the influences of various contemporary styles. Initially he was inspired by the elegant figures of Parmigianino (1503–1540), which were introduced in Ferrara by Girolamo da Carpi (1501 – c. 1557). He later set himself apart from this intellectual and highly formal vision of Mannerism by turning towards the magical, mood-driven world of Dosso Dossi. During his stay in Venice he was introduced to the late works of Giorgione and those of Veronese and Titian, which were an important influence on his work. Virgin and Child with Saints Mary Magdalene, Peter, Clare, Francis, and an Abbess A number of his works are in the collection of the Galleria Borghese in Rome, The Bathing Venus, Diana and Endymion and Venus and Adonis.

Early life Ingalls was born in New York City and raised in Virginia. He received his A.B. in 1936, at Harvard majoring in Greek and Latin. and his A.M. in 1938 studying symbolic logic under Willard Van Orman Quine He was appointed a junior fellow in the Harvard Society of Fellows in 1939 after which he set off for Calcutta for the study of Navya-Nyāya logic with Kalipada Tarkacharya (1938–41). His fellowship was interrupted by the Second World War during which he served as an Army code breaker decoding Japanese radio messages for the Office of Strategic Services (1942–44). After the war, Ingalls returned to Harvard as Wales Professor of Sanskrit. He was particularly known for his translation and commentary in An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry, which contains some 1,700 Sanskrit verses collected by a Buddhist abbot, Vidyākara, in Bengal around AD 1050. Ingalls was a student of the Indian grammarian Shivram Dattatray Joshi, and the teacher of many famous students of Sanskrit, such as Wendy Doniger, Diana Eck, John Stratton Hawley, Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, Bimal Krishna Matilal, Robert Thurman, Sheldon Pollock, Karl Harrington Potter, Phyllis Granoff, Indira Viswanathan Peterson, David Pingree, and Gary Tubb. He was renowned for the rigor of his introductory Sanskrit course. He was the editor of the Harvard Oriental Series from 1950 to 1983.Harvard Oriental Series Ingalls was the father of the computer scientist Dan Ingalls and the author Rachel Ingalls. He was also chairman of the department of Sanskrit and Indian studies and president of the American Oriental Society. An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry Volume 44 of the Harvard Oriental Series, 'An Anthology of Sanskrit Court Poetry', is the acclaimed English translation by Ingalls of the Sanskrit text 'Subhasitaratnakosa' of Vidyakara. The book has a lengthy introduction by Ingalls containing an incisive analysis of the structure of the Sanskrit language, and also of Ingalls's perspective on Sanskrit literature in general, and Sanskrit poetry in particular. It also has a section titled 'On the Passing of Judgements' in which Ingalls criticizes some critics of Sanskrit poetry. Criticism of nineteenth and twentieth century western Sanskritists Ingalls writes that after the initial excitement at the discovery of Sanskrit literature, which produced the enthusiastic and positive reviews of British Sanskritists like Hastings and Sir William Jones, there was a long period in which English writers subjected Sanskrit literature to the literary canons of their own land. By doing this their judgements were sometimes \\"monstrous\\" according to Ingalls. The Sanskritist Fitzedward Hall, writes Ingalls, being troubled by the sometimes erotic imagery in the poetry of the Sanskrit poet Subandhu, exclaimed that Subandhu \\"was no better, at the very best, than a specious savage\\" and A. A. Macdonell according to Ingalls found nothing to say of the great Sanskrit poets Bharavi and Magha except that they favored 'verbal tricks and metrical puzzles\\". The judgement of these scholars, explains Ingalls, was clouded with bias in as much as it was based on nineteenth century western morals and nineteenth century western notions of literature. \\"At no point was it enlightened by reference to the critical literature of Sanskrit itself\\", writes Ingalls. Ingalls then goes on to criticize the British scholar Arthur Berriedale Keith of whom Ingalls writes that although Keith was a great scholar of Vedic studies and modern Indian law, 'it is obvious from his works that for the most part he disliked Sanskrit literature' and that 'of Keith's reading, it seems to me, no word ever passed beyond his head to the heart'. Ingalls notes that when criticizing Sanskrit poets, Keith never applies the remarks of any Sanskrit critic to the work he is judging.

Life  Kaminski was born in Tiengen in the Schwarzwald, the son of an Old Catholic priest of Jewish parentage. After a short period working in a bank in Offenbach, he moved to Heidelberg, originally to study politics. However, a chance meeting with Martha Warburg changed his mind: she recognised his musical gift and became his patroness. In 1909 he went to Berlin and began studying music at the Stern Conservatoire, piano with Severin Eisenberger. In 1914 he began work as a piano teacher in Benediktbeuern. His friends and contemporaries at this time included the painter Emil Nolde and also Franz Marc, whose wife was among his piano students. In 1916 me married Friederike Mathilde Jopp the daughter of Karl and Marie Jopp (born Schad). Friederike or Elfriede as Kaminski called her, was a singer in Munich. During World War I Kaminski was also active as a choirmaster and teacher of composition. Later he received a professorship at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, where he became director of a master class in composition (thus treading in the footsteps of Hans Pfitzner). His most significant pupils were Carl Orff, Heinz Schubert and Reinhard Schwarz-Schilling. His contract was terminated in 1933 with no renewal on the grounds of his \\"political opinions\\" and he returned to Benediktbeuern. Various attempts to re-establish his career came to nothing for the same reason. A check of his ancestry - he had been categorised in 1938 as a \\"half-Jew\\", and in 1941 declared a \\"quarter-Jew\\" - led to an ongoing ban on the performance of his works. He found himself obliged to flee, to France and Switzerland among other places. Between 1939 and 1945 he lost three children, and died himself in 1946 at Ried, Bavaria.

The church is led by Pastor Dale Oquist. The church campus includes Fresno Christian High School, a private school attended by students in grades K-12.  History  Peoples Church was founded in 1954 by several families from the Fresno area. The first pastor, Rev. Floyd Hawkins, led the church from January 1955 to August 1959. He was followed by Rev. Guy A. Davidson who led the church until April 1963. Under his leadership the congregation of about 200 converted old turkey houses into their first building. In 1963, Pastor G. L. Johnson replaced Davidson as head pastor. Under Johnson's leadership, the church grew into a 2000-seat sanctuary in 1977 at the church's current location at Cedar and Herndon avenues. Since moving to the Herndon campus, the church has added two Sunday school buildings, a youth building, a Worship Ministries wing and, most recently, the G.L. Johnson Chapel. On Sunday, June 3, 2007, Johnson announced during the three morning services his intention to tender his resignation in spring 2008. He said the timeliness of his decision was based upon his 80th birthday and his 45th anniversary as leader of the Peoples Church congregation. Johnson retired in late February 2008, and the pastoral search committee began a nationwide search for a replacement. In 2010, Rev. Dale Oquist, formerly of Olympia, Washington, was elected Lead Pastor at Peoples Church by an overwhelming majority of voting members. In 2018, Peoples Church moved the 220 ton G.L. Johnson Chapel in order to make room for future expansion. The expansion plan is expected to cost $20 million dollar and be completed by Easter 2021. The new construction will include a new 45,000 square foot building will be a dedicated children's area and an extended lobby.  Creative arts  Peoples Church is known for its strong use and support of creative arts and technology. Peoples Church Christmas celebration has been a highlight of holiday events for the Fresno area. Starting in the 1970s, it has grown to a full production including contemporary band and orchestra, choreography, lighting effects and a variety of original and arranged Christmas music. In June 2014, ChurchProduction.com published an article describing a recent auditorium remodel including the use of LED moving heads from ADJ Lighting, which are mounted on six wire ladders in front of mesh panels. In 2016, Peoples Church did a massive video upgrade, replacing their old SD cameras and switcher with 3 new 1080p cameras and a new switcher, replacing their old 1024x768 rear projection video screens with new 1080p screens, upgrading their livestream capabilities to HD, and allowing the video feed from the auditorium to be simulcasted to the G.L.

During the approximately two years of its existence starvation, disease, street executions, maltreatment, and deportations to concentration and extermination camps reduced the ghetto's population from an estimated 40,000 to zero. Only several hundred people managed to survive, mostly by hiding in the forests surrounding the city, joining Soviet partisans,Piotr Zychowicz, \\"Wybory Icchaka Arada\\" (the Yitzhak Arad choices), Rzeczpospolita, 12-07-2008. More external sources at Yitzhak Arad article.Piotr Zychowicz, \\"Icchak Arad: od NKVD do Yad Vashem\\" (From NKVD to Yad Vashem) Rzeczpospolita, July 12, 2008 or sheltering with sympathetic locals.  Background  Before the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Wilno (Vilna in Hebrew) was the capital of the Wilno Voivodship in the Second Polish Republic. The predominant languages of the city were Polish and to a lesser extent, Yiddish. The Lithuanian-speaking population at the time was a small minority, at about 6% of the city's population according to contemporary Lithuanian sources. By 1931, the city had 195,000 inhabitants, making it the fifth largest city in Poland with varied industries and new factories, as well as a well respected university. Lithuanian Nazi policeman with Jewish prisoners, July 1941 Wilno was a predominantly Polish and Jewish city since the Polish-Lithuanian borders were delineated in 1922 by the League of Nations in the aftermath of Żeligowski's Mutiny. After the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Joseph Stalin transferred Wilno to Lithuania in October, according to the Soviet–Lithuanian Mutual Assistance Treaty. Some two years later, on 26 June 1941, the German Army entered Vilna, followed by the Einsatzkommando death squad Einsatzgruppe B. Local Lithuanian leaders advocated ethnic cleansing of Jews and Poles. Throughout the summer, German troops and their Lithuanian collaborators killed more than 21,000 Jews living in Vilnius, in a mass extermination program. The Jewish population of Vilnius on the eve of the Holocaust was at least 60,000, some estimates say 80,000, including refugees from German-occupied Poland to the west, minus a small number who managed to flee onward to the Soviet Union. The kidnapping and mass murder of Jews in the city commenced before the ghetto was set up by the advancing German forces, resulting in an execution of approximately 21,000 victims prior to 6 September 1941. The Lithuanian kidnappers were known in Yiddish as hapunes, meaning grabbers or snatchers. 1941: Establishment of the ghetto Map of Vilna Ghetto (small ghetto, in olive-green) In order to pacify the predominantly poorer Jewish quarter in the Vilnius Old Town and force the rest of the more affluent Jewish residents into the new German-envisioned ghetto, the Nazis staged – as a pretext – the so- called Great Provocation incident on 31 August 1941, led by SS Einsatzkommando 9 Oberscharführer Horst Schweinberger under orders from Gebietskommissar of the Vilnius municipality Hans Christian Hingst and Franz Murer, Hingst's deputy for Jewish affairs under “provisional directives” of Reichskommissar Hinrich Lohse. Murer, Hingst, and Vilnius mayor Karolis Dabulevičius selected the site for the future ghetto and staged a distant sniping at German soldiers in front of a cinema, from a window on the corner of Stiklių (Glezer, meaning Szklana in Polish) and Didžioji (Wielka, Great Street in Polish, hence the name for the event) streets, by two Lithuanians in civilian clothes who had broken into an apartment belonging to Jews. The Lithuanians fled the apartment, then returned with awaiting German soldiers, captured two Jews, accused them of firing on the German soldiers, beat them and then shot them on the spot. Stiklių and Mėsinių (Jatkowa) streets were ransacked by the local militia, and Jews were beaten up. At night, in “retaliation,” all Jews were driven out of the neighborhood the Nazis had selected as the future ghetto territory, street by street, and the next day the women and children on remaining streets were seized while the men were at work. Men at workplaces were also seized. Jews were taken to Lukiškės Prison, then to Paneriai, also known as Ponary (or Ponar), where they were murdered between 1 September and 3 September. 5,000 to 10,000 people were murdered , including ten members of the Judenrat. The objective was to clear an area for the establishment of a ghetto to imprison all the Jews of Vilnius and its suburbs. The area designated for the ghetto was the old Jewish quarter in the center of the city. While Vilna never had a ghetto per se except for some very limited restrictions on the movement and settlement of Jews during the Middle Ages, the area chosen by the Nazis for their ghetto was predominantly and historically inhabited by Jews. The Nazis split the area into two Jewish quarters (Large Ghetto and Small Ghetto), with a non-ghetto corridor running down Deutschegasse (Niemiecka or Vokiečių) Street. On 6–7 September 1941, the Nazis herded the remaining 20,000 Jews into the two ghettos by evicting them from their homes, during which 3,700 were killed. Converts, \\"half-Jews\\" and spouses of Jews were also forced into the ghetto. The move to the ghetto was extremely hurried and difficult, and Jews were not allowed to use transportation, being able to take only what they were physically able to carry. The first Aktion was called the Gelb Schein (yellow pass) Aktion as the Germans delivered 3,000 passes to workers and their families and let 12,000 people on the ghetto. Between 25 and 27 October, 1941, 3,781 people who didn't have this pass were killed in Ponary. The two-ghetto arrangement made it easier for the Nazis to control what the victims knew of their fate beforehand, facilitating the Nazis' goal of total extermination. A 2 ghetto model was also used in Warsaw. Like the other Jewish ghettos Nazi Germany set up during World War II, the Vilnius Ghetto was created both to dehumanize the people and to exploit its inmates as slave labor. Conditions were intended to be extremely poor and crowded, subjecting inhabitants to unsanitary conditions, disease and daily death. 1942: Quiet period =Health care= Jewish Vilna was known for its distinguished medical tradition, which inmates of the ghetto managed to maintain to some degree during the Holocaust.Beinfeld, Solon, \\"Health Care in the Vilna Ghetto.\\" 12 Holocaust & Genocide Stud. 67 (1998): 66-67. As with most ghettos established by the Germans, a sign was put right outside in front stating: \\"Achtung! Seuchengefahr\\" (\\"Attention! Danger of Infection\\"). Mortality rates did, indeed, increase in the Vilna Ghetto as compared with before the war. However, due largely to the efforts of the ghetto's Health Department, the Vilna Ghetto had no major epidemics despite malnourishment, cold, and overcrowding.Beinfeld, Solon. \\"Health Care in the Vilna Ghetto.\\" 12 Holocaust & Genocide Stud. 67 (1998): 66-67. According to Dr. Lazar Epstein, head of Sanitary-Epidemiological Section of the ghetto's Health Department, the inmates of the ghetto, left to their own devices, could have lived a very long time, certainly to the end of the war, despite the numerous privations. = Cultural life = The Vilna Ghetto was called \\"Yerushalayim of the Ghettos\\" because it was known for its intellectual and cultural spirit. Before the war, Vilnius had been known as \\"Yerushalayim d'Lita\\"Kruk, Herman (author), Harshay, Benjamin (editor) and Barbara Harshay (translator). The Last Days of the Jerusalem of Lithuania: Chronicles from the Vilna Ghetto and the Camps 1939-1944. New Haven: Yale UP, 2002, p. xxix. (Yiddish: Jerusalem of Lithuania) for the same reason. The center of cultural life in the ghetto was the Mefitze Haskole Library, which was called the \\"House of Culture\\". It contained a library of 45,000 volumes,Marrus, p. 121. reading hall, archive, statistical bureau, room for scientific work, museum, book kiosk, post office, and sports ground. Groups, such as the Literary and Artistic Union and the Brit Ivrit Union, organized events commemorating Yiddish and Hebrew authors and put on plays in these languages. The popular Yiddish magazine Folksgezunt was continued in the ghetto and its essays were presented in public lectures. Yitskhok Rudashevski (1927–1943), a young teen who wrote a diary of his life in the ghetto during 1941 to 1943, mentions a number of these events and his participation in them. He was murdered in the liquidation of 1943, probably at Paneriai. His diary was discovered in 1944 by his cousin. The Vilna Ghetto was well known for its theatrical productions during World War II.Beinfield, Solon. \\"The Culture Life Of The Vilna Ghetto.\\" (1997): Annual 1 Chapter 1. Jacob Gens, the head of Jewish police and the ruler of the Vilna Ghetto, was given the responsibility for the starting of this theatre. Performances included poetry by Jewish Authors, dramatizations of short stories, and new work by the young people of the ghetto. The Ghetto Theatre was a great source of revenue and had a calming effect on the public. A total of 111 performances had been given by January 10, 1943, with a total of 34,804 tickets sold. The theatre was renovated to accommodate a larger audience and be better-looking to public eye. The theatre permitted the non-Aryan race to display their power through plays and songs; for instance, one of the songs that was sung was called \\"Endurance.\\" The last theatrical production, Der Mabl (The Flood), was produced by the Swedish dramatist Henning Berger and opened in the summer of 1943, in the last week of the Ghetto's existence. The play, set in an American saloon during a flood, featured a group of people who banded together during a time of danger and need. Joshua Sobol's play Ghetto recounts the last days of the Vilna Ghetto theatre company.Fleche, Anne. \\"Ghetto: The Last Performance In the Vilna Ghetto.\\" Theater Journal41, no. 4 (1989): 539-540. = Resistance = Abba Kovner (center, standing) with FPO members The Fareynikte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO), or United Partisan Organization, was formed on 21 January 1942 in the ghetto. It took for its motto \\"We will not go like sheep to the slaughter,\\" proposed by Abba Kovner.Marrus, Michael R. The Holocaust in History. Hanover: University Press of New England, 1987, p. 108. This was one of the first resistance organizations established in a Nazi ghetto. Unlike in other ghettos, the resistance movement in the Vilna Ghetto was not run by ghetto officials. Jacob Gens, appointed head of the ghetto by the Nazis but originally chief of police, ostensibly cooperated with German officials in stopping armed struggle. The FPO represented the full spectrum of political persuasions and parties in Jewish life. It was led by Yitzhak Wittenberg, Josef Glazman, and Abba Kovner. The purposes of the FPO were to establish a means for the self-defence of the ghetto population, to sabotage German industrial and military activities, and to support the broader struggle of partisans and Red Army operatives against German forces. Poet Hirsh Glick, a ghetto inmate who later died after being deported to Estonia, penned the words for what became the famous Partisan Hymn, Zog nit keyn mol. Reichskommissariat Ostland ghettos (marked with red-and-gold stars) In early 1943, the Germans caught a member of the Communist underground, who, under torture, revealed some contacts; the Judenrat, in response to German threats, tried to turn Wittenberg, head of the FPO, over to the Gestapo. The FPO was able to rescue him after he was seized in the apartment of Jacob Gens in a fight with Jewish ghetto police. Gens brought in heavies, the leaders of the work brigades, and effectively turned the majority of the population against the resistance members, claiming they were provoking the Germans and asking rhetorically whether it was worth sacrificing tens of thousands for the sake of one man. Ghetto prisoners assembled and demanded the FPO give Wittenberg up. Ultimately, Wittenberg himself made the decision to submit to Nazi demands. He was taken to Gestapo headquarters in Vilnius and was reportedly found dead in his cell the next morning. Most people believed he had committed suicide. The rumour was that Gens had slipped him a cyanide pill in their final meeting. The FPO was demoralized by this chain of events and began to pursue a policy of sending young people out to the forest to join other Jewish partisans. This was controversial as well because the Germans applied a policy of \\"collective responsibility\\" under which all family members of anyone who had joined the partisans were executed. In the Vilna Ghetto, a \\"family\\" often included a non- relation who registered as a member of the family in order to receive housing and a pitiful food ration. When the Germans came to liquidate the ghetto in September 1943, members of the FPO went on alert. Gens took control of the liquidation in order to keep the Nazi forces out of the ghetto and away from a partisan ambush, but helped fill the quota of Jews with those who could fight but were not necessarily part of the resistance. The FPO fled to the forest and fought with the partisans. 1943: Liquidation From the establishment of the ghetto until January 1942, task groups of German and Lithuanian Einsatzgruppen regularly carried out the surprise operations called Aktionen, often on Jewish holidays. The ghetto residents were rounded up and deported, usually for subsequent executions. In the Aktion on Yom Kippur of 1 October 1941, the Germans ordered the Judenrat to lead the arrests leading to the death of 1,983 people; residents found by the Jewish police lacking work permits were arrested and transferred to German custody. The same month the Germans liquidated the Small Ghetto, where they had relocated \\"unproductive\\" individuals (i.e., who were old, ill, or otherwise considered unfit for labour); most of the prisoners were taken to Ponary and shot. About 20,000 Jews, including 8,000 without papers, remained in the Large Ghetto. The period between January 1942 and March 1943 was known as the time of ghetto \\"stabilization\\"; the Aktionen ceased and some semblance of normal life resumed. The quiet period continued until 6 August, when the Germans commenced the deportation of 7,130 Jews to Estonia on the order of Heinrich Himmler; this was finished on 5 September. Following an order of Rudolf Neugebauer, the head of the Vilnius Gestapo, the ghetto was liquidated on 23–24 September 1943 under the command of Oberscharführer Bruno Kittel. The majority of the remaining residents were sent to the Vaivara concentration camp in Estonia,Yitzak Arad, The Holocaust in the Soviet Union, 2009, , p. 323. killed in the forest of Paneriai, or sent to the death camps in German-occupied Poland. A small group of Jews remained in Vilna after the liquidation of the Ghetto, primarily at the Kailis and HKP 562 forced labour camps. Inmates of HKP 562 repaired automobiles for the German Army; the camp was commanded by the Wehrmacht Major Karl Plagge who, with the cooperation of his officers and men, was able to shield the Jewish auto-workers from much of the abuse slave laborers were ordinarily subjected to. When the Red Army approached Vilna and the SS came to take over the camp, Plagge gave his workers a covert warning; some workers escaped, others hid in hiding places they had prepared with Plagge's knowledge, from which they subsequently escaped. Two-hundred and fifty Jews at HKP 562 survived the war. They represent the single largest group of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust in Vilnius.  Post war  Among all the European Jewish communities during WWII, the Lithuanian one was the most affected by the Holocaust. Rising to 265,000 individuals in June 1941, it was decimated and lost 254,000, or 95%, of its members during the Nazi occupation of Lithuania.

In July 2007, KSFR moved to 101.1 FM, becoming one of a handful of public radio stations nationally whose frequency is outside of the assigned spectrum for non-commercial stations (88-91 FM). History 101.1 White Rock had aired commercial programming before 2007. Over the years it has had an Oldies format as KNLA \\"LA 101\\" in the early 1990s and a '70s' hits format as KSFQ \\"Q 101\\" later in the decade. In 2000 it switched to Hot AC as \\"Mix 101\\" but would shift to rhythmic oldies after Clear Channel bought the station. It began a smooth jazz format called \\"The Cat\\" in early 2005 which ended in July 2007. After Clear Channel announced its plan to go private in November 2006, they announced they intended to sell most of their radio stations outside of the top 100 Arbitron markets - including their Santa Fe-only stations KSFQ and KBAC. Both were sold to Educational Media Foundation, a religious broadcaster in 2007 however KBAC 98.1 was soon sold to Hutton Broadcasting so it could retain its locally programmed adult album alternative format. On June 29, 2007, KSFQ and KSFR (owned by Santa Fe Community College) announced that they intended on doing a frequency swap in the next three months, moving KSFQ to 90.7 FM and KSFR to 101.1 FM,Public radio for a wider audience with KSFR expanding its broadcast area south into Albuquerque and north into Taos. When the transition was completed, KSFR was simulcasting on both the 90.7 and 101.1 frequencies until the deal was approved by the FCC. 90.7 is now KQLV \\"K-Love\\" a Christian Contemporary music format. = Call letters = The call letters were originally used by an independent San Francisco classical music FM station, which began broadcasting on March 11, 1958. Al Levitt, its co-owner and General Manager was one of the principal hosts. Program Director Bill Agee and Bruce Johansen, who later became President and CEO of NATPE (the National Association of Television Program Executives) were the other main personalities of this concert station. KSFR was purchased by Metromedia in October 1966. Metromedia began switching to a rock music format in the spring of 1968 and, on May 21, 1968, they changed the call letters of KSFR San Francisco to KSAN.

It campaigns to change public opinion and combat discrimination, and to help and support those with a visual difference.  History  The charity was founded in 1992 by James Partridge OBE, who sustained severe burns in a car fire when he was 18 years old. He wrote about the experience in a book, Changing Faces, in the late 1980s, and was persuaded to set up the charity after speaking about it with doctors from University College Hospital in London.  Operations  The charity provides psychological support for people with disfigurements, by providing advice, information, counselling, and workshops across the UK. It also provides advice to health professionals, teachers, and employers, by running training courses and study days that enable professionals to develop effective clinical services, inclusive school curricula, and equal-opportunities policies. While modern reconstructive surgery and other medical treatments can make disfigurement less noticeable, some scarring, asymmetry, or change in complexion usually remains. Changing Faces complements medical and surgical interventions by addressing the psychological and social challenges posed by disfigurement. Its services are based on academic research and informed by service users, including a Young People's Council. In 2012, the British Red Cross transferred its Skin Camouflage Service to Changing Faces. The service \\"helps individuals to regain self-confidence and independence\\", and now operates at more than 120 locations throughout the UK. =Campaigns= The charity's Face Equality campaign aims to ensure that people with disfigurement are treated without prejudice or discrimination. The campaign targets employers, schools, health care professionals, the media, policy makers, and the general public, and has used posters featuring adults and children with facial disfigurement. In November 2009, Partridge presented the lunchtime news bulletins on UK television channel Five. The What Success Looks Like campaign seeks to transform the treatment of disfigurement in the workplace. Through employers and industry bodies, it aims to inform business leaders and human- resource managers about disfigurement. It also serves to help people living with a visual difference to overcome barriers. In 2017, the charity released a set of educational resources to help school teachers raise the topic of facial disfigurement among pupils. These resources were launched to coincide with the UK release of the movie Wonder, which tells the story of a boy born with a craniofacial condition. In the same year, the charity collaborated on a series of portraits taken by photographer Rankin, to challenge conventions of beauty in the fashion industry. In 2017, the charity released Disfigurement in the UK, a report into the experience of people who live with a condition, mark, or scar affecting their appearance, with consideration of the issue against school, work, relationships, health care, and crime. The report was released on the charity's Face Equality Day.  People  The chief executive is Becky HewittBecky Hewitt and Chair is David Clayton. Patrons have included actor Michelle Dockery, Rory Bremner, William Simons, Lord Fellowes of West Stafford, Simon Weston OBE, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, and comedian and actor Jan Ravens.

PBA is one of nine Army installations in the United States that stored chemical weapons. PBA supplies specialized production, storage, maintenance and distribution of readiness products, and delivers technical services to the Armed Forces and Homeland Security. PBA also designs, manufactures and refurbishes smoke, riot control, and incendiary munitions, as well as chemical/biological defense operations items. It serves as a technology center for illuminating and infrared munitions and is also the only place in the Northern Hemisphere where white phosphorus munitions are filled. Its Homeland Security mission includes first-responder equipment training and surveillance of pre-positioned equipment. Capabilities Capabilities of the center include: chemical defense and test equipment; individual and collective chemical protection and decontamination systems; chemical material surveillance program; machining, fabrication and assembly; specialty ammunition production; less than lethal ammunition production; and quality assurance and joint logistics services. History PBA was established in November 1941 for the manufacture of incendiary grenades and bombs. It was originally named the Chemical Warfare Arsenal but was renamed four months later.Pine Bluff Chemical Activity (PBCA) The mission expanded to include production and storage of pyrotechnic, riot control, and chemical-filled munitions. At the height of World War II, the plant expanded from making magnesium and thermite incendiary munitions to a chemical warfare manufacturing facility as well, producing lethal gases and chemical compounds installed in artillery shells and specifically designed bombs.Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture, Pine Bluff Arsenal In an incident after World War II, several captured German rockets containing mustard agents were accidentally launched into the surrounding countryside. Biological weapons operations were conducted at PBA from 1953 to 1969; but operations ceased when President Nixon banned biological weapons after public outcry over Agent Orange. Between 1954 and 1967, at least seven different biological agents were produced at the facility. All biological agents were destroyed between 1971 and 1973. The PBA chemical weapons stockpile consisted of declared quantities of rockets, land mines, and ton containers. These obsolete weapons were safely stored in high-security structures and carefully monitored until the U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency completed their safe elimination in November 2010. PBA also safely stored other items classified as non-stockpile chemical materiel, which is not part of the nation's chemical weapons stockpile. The U.S. Army Chemical Material Agency completed a number of treaty-mandated chemical warfare disposal operations at PBA, described below. Pine Bluff Ton Container Decontamination Facility (PBTCDF): The PBTCDF began operations in September 2003, with the mission of decontaminating and recycling more than containers (TCs) stored at PBA. The steel containers once held hazardous materials and required decontamination for residual chemical agent hazard. Operators heated the TCs to for 60 minutes, well in excess of the standard required by the Army to achieve chemical agent decontamination. This process significantly reduced liquid waste. Once decontaminated, TCs were loaded onto trailers for transport to a treatment, storage and disposal facility. There, they were cut in half, any remaining residue was removed, and the steel was recycled. PBTCDF successfully completed operations in July 2011; one result of this process was the recycling of more than of steel. Pine Bluff Explosive Destruction System (PBEDS): PBEDS began operations in June 2006 to destroy more than 1,200 recovered chemical warfare munitions at PBA – the largest inventory of recovered chemical warfare materiel in the nation. The system involved three Explosive Destruction System (EDS) units, each set up in a vapor containment structure. The EDS uses cutting charges to explosively access chemical munitions, eliminating their explosive capacity before the chemical agent is neutralized. The PBEDS inventory included 4.2-inch mortars as well as German Traktor rockets, which were captured during World War II. PBEDS operators destroyed the last munition in April 2010, marking the destruction of all non-stockpile materiel declared when the United States entered into the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Pine Bluff Former Production Facilities: PBA once housed two chemical warfare production facilities, and NSCMP was charged with destroying them to comply with the CWC. Destroyed in 1999, the BZ Fill Facility filled munitions with the agent BZ, a hallucinogen. In 2003, NSCMP began demolition of the former Pine Bluff Integrated Binary Production Facilities (PB IBPF), designed to produce binary chemicals and fill binary chemical weapons. These weapons were designed to mix two non-lethal chemicals to form a chemical agent in flight to a target. The DF Production/M20 Canister Fill and Close Facility was the only facility operated. From 1988 to 1990 it produced the binary precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), inserting the chemical into coffee can-sized M20 canisters for use in the M687 155 mm Binary Artillery Projectile. The BLU-80/B Bigeye Bomb Fill Facility, QL Production Facility and DC Production Facility never operated, and all were demolished. The final remaining PB IBPF building, intended to fill binary munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System, but never used for that purpose, was reutilized as the Pine Bluff Binary Destruction Facility (PB BDF), to neutralize the binary precursor chemicals DF and QL. After neutralization was completed in October 2006, demolition of the building commenced. Completed on Dec. 28, 2006, it marked the end of the PB IBPF demolition and the last former chemical warfare production facility destroyed in the United States. This accomplishment was significant since it enabled NSCMP to surpass the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty milestone of demolition of all the nation's former production facilities four months ahead of schedule. Approximately 2,800 tons of metal were recycled from the IBPF. Assessment: Contents of recovered items at PBA were identified using the Pine Bluff Munitions Assessment System (PBMAS). PBMAS determined the contents and explosive condition of items before processing to enhance safe handling, treatment and disposal. PBMAS began analyzing the items in July 2005, using an X-ray system known as Digital Radiography and Computed Tomography, along with an assessment system known as Portable Isotopic Neutron Spectroscopy. Prior to PBMAS, NSCMP also assessed 300 drums that contained recovered chemical warfare materiel, known as the XP300 mission. Chemical Agent Identification Set (CAIS) Destruction: Another successful NSCMP mission at PBA included the Rapid Response System (RRS), a transportable treatment technology, which processed more than 5,300 CAIS items once stored at PBA. The RRS began operations in August 2005, and completed processing in November 2006. For decades the arsenal stored chemical agent rockets (GB55's). During the 1980s, these were defueled and the warheads were destroyed. Mustard agent, VX, G were stored in large bunkers on the premises.Pine Bluff Chemical Activity and Pine Bluff Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, What is Stockpile/Non-Stockpile, U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency Fact Sheet The Associated Press reported a leak in a container of white phosphorus was suspected to have ignited the fire that destroyed a warehouse at the Pine Bluff Arsenal on .

Pairing heaps are heap-ordered multiway tree structures, and can be considered simplified Fibonacci heaps. They are considered a \\"robust choice\\" for implementing such algorithms as Prim's MST algorithm, and support the following operations (assuming a min-heap): * find-min: simply return the top element of the heap. * meld: compare the two root elements, the smaller remains the root of the result, the larger element and its subtree is appended as a child of this root. * insert: create a new heap for the inserted element and meld into the original heap. * decrease-key (optional): remove the subtree rooted at the key to be decreased, replace the key with a smaller key, then meld the result back into the heap. * delete-min: remove the root and do repeated melds of its subtrees until one tree remains. Various merging strategies are employed. The analysis of pairing heaps' time complexity was initially inspired by that of splay trees. The amortized time per delete-min is , and the operations find-min, meld, and insert run in amortized time. When a decrease-key operation is added as well, determining the precise asymptotic running time of pairing heaps has turned out to be difficult. Initially, the time complexity of this operation was conjectured on empirical grounds to be , but Fredman proved that the amortized time per decrease-key is at least \\\\Omega(\\\\log\\\\log n) for some sequences of operations. Using a different amortization argument, Pettie then proved that insert, meld, and decrease-key all run in O(2^{2\\\\sqrt{\\\\log\\\\log n}}) amortized time, which is o(\\\\log n). Elmasry later introduced elaborations of pairing heaps (lazy, consolidate) for which decrease-key runs in O(\\\\log \\\\log n) amortized time and other operations have optimal amortized bounds, but no tight \\\\Theta(\\\\log\\\\log n) bound is known for the original data structure. Although the asymptotic performance of pairing heaps is worse than other priority queue algorithms such as Fibonacci heaps, which perform decrease-key in O(1) amortized time, the performance in practice is excellent. Jones and Larkin, Sen, and Tarjan conducted experiments on pairing heaps and other heap data structures. They concluded that d-ary heaps such as binary heaps are faster than all other heap implementations when the decrease-key operation is not needed (and hence there is no need to externally track the location of nodes in the heap), but that when decrease- key is needed pairing heaps are often faster than d-ary heaps and almost always faster than other pointer-based heaps, including data structures like Fibonacci heaps that are theoretically more efficient. Chen et al. examined priority queues specifically for use with Dijkstra's algorithm and concluded that in normal cases using a d-ary heap without decrease-key (instead duplicating nodes on the heap and ignoring redundant instances) resulted in better performance, despite the inferior theoretical performance guarantees. Structure A pairing heap is either an empty heap, or a pairing tree consisting of a root element and a possibly empty list of pairing trees. The heap ordering property requires that parent of any node is no greater than the node itself. The following description assumes a purely functional heap that does not support the decrease-key operation. type PairingTree[Elem] = Heap(elem: Elem, subheaps: List[PairingTree[Elem ) type PairingHeap[Elem] = Empty  PairingTree[Elem] A pointer-based implementation for RAM machines, supporting decrease-key, can be achieved using three pointers per node, by representing the children of a node by a singly-linked list: a pointer to the node's first child, one to its next sibling, and one to its previous sibling (or, for the leftmost sibling, to its parent). Alternatively, the previous- pointer can be omitted by letting the last child point back to the parent, if a single boolean flag is added to indicate \\"end of list\\". This achieves a more compact structure at the expense of a constant overhead factor per operation. Operations =find-min= The function find-min simply returns the root element of the heap: function find-min(heap: PairingHeap[Elem]) -> Elem if heap is Empty error else return heap.elem =meld= Melding with an empty heap returns the other heap, otherwise a new heap is returned that has the minimum of the two root elements as its root element and just adds the heap with the larger root to the list of subheaps: function meld(heap1, heap2: PairingHeap[Elem]) -> PairingHeap[Elem] if heap1 is Empty return heap2 elsif heap2 is Empty return heap1 elsif heap1.elem < heap2.elem return Heap(heap1.elem, heap2 :: heap1.subheaps) else return Heap(heap2.elem, heap1 :: heap2.subheaps) =insert= The easiest way to insert an element into a heap is to meld the heap with a new heap containing just this element and an empty list of subheaps: function insert(elem: Elem, heap: PairingHeap[Elem]) -> PairingHeap[Elem] return meld(Heap(elem, []), heap) =delete-min= The only non-trivial fundamental operation is the deletion of the minimum element from the heap. This requires performing repeated melds of its children until only one tree remains. The standard strategy first melds the subheaps in pairs (this is the step that gave this data structure its name) from left to right and then melds the resulting list of heaps from right to left: function delete-min(heap: PairingHeap[Elem]) -> PairingHeap[Elem] if heap is Empty error else return merge-pairs(heap.subheaps) This uses the auxiliary function merge-pairs: function merge-pairs(list: List[PairingTree[Elem ) -> PairingHeap[Elem] if length(list)  0 return Empty elsif length(list)  1 return list[0] else return meld(meld(list[0], list[1]), merge- pairs(list[2..])) That this does indeed implement the described two-pass left- to-right then right-to-left merging strategy can be seen from this reduction: merge-pairs([H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, H7]) => meld(meld(H1, H2), merge- pairs([H3, H4, H5, H6, H7])) # meld H1 and H2 to H12, then the rest of the list => meld(H12, meld(meld(H3, H4), merge-pairs([H5, H6, H7]))) # meld H3 and H4 to H34, then the rest of the list => meld(H12, meld(H34, meld(meld(H5, H6), merge-pairs([H7])))) # meld H5 and H6 to H56, then the rest of the list => meld(H12, meld(H34, meld(H56, H7))) # switch direction, meld the last two resulting heaps, giving H567 => meld(H12, meld(H34, H567)) # meld the last two resulting heaps, giving H34567 => meld(H12, H34567) # finally, meld the first pair with the result of merging the rest => H1234567 Summary of running times References External links * Louis Wasserman discusses pairing heaps and their implementation in Haskell in The Monad Reader, Issue 16 (pp. 37–52). * pairing heaps, Sartaj Sahni Category:Heaps (data structures) Category:Amortized data structures ","title":"Pairing heap"},{"id":"3402061","text":"Li Lingjuan (; born April 10, 1966) was first Chinese woman to win an Olympic medal in archery.

(http://m.themonitor.com/news/local/civil-rights-leader-antonio-orendain-died- tuesday/article_c5dd968a-01bb-11e6-ae37-3f702e8b1591.html?mode=jqm) in August 1975, nearly ten years after he began organizing farm workers for the United Farm Workers in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas. Orendain worked for Cesar Chavez in the Chicago UFW national grape and lettuce boycott office. After returning to South Texas Orendain left the UFW to devote himself to organizing Texas agricultural workers under a separate banner much like those who founded Obreros Unidos in Wisconsin, and the Farm Labor Organizing Committee in Ohio. It appears that there were conflicts between the United Farm Workers and the Texas Farm Workers Union. History In 1975, a group of Rio Grande Valley farmworkers supported the foundation of the TFWU under Orendain's leadership. Because of the tensions between Chavez and Orendain, the union had a difficult time establishing itself. The TFWU faced opposition from the growers and never gained the support of the United Farm Workers Union and the AFL-CIO. http://m.themonitor.com/news/local/civil-rights-leader- antonio-orendain-died- tuesday/article_c5dd968a-01bb-11e6-ae37-3f702e8b1591.html?mode=jqm Like its California counterpart the United Farm Workers, the TFWU pressed the state of Texas to establish a Texas Agricultural Board. This effort failed in Texas where no Agricultural Board was established. In late February 1977 union members began a 420-mile (670 km) march from San Juan, Texas to the capital at Austin just 11 years after the first Texas farm worker march on Austin. This second march ended on April 2 at the state capitol building. That same year, Orendain led forty union members on a well publicized 1,600-mile (2,560 km) march from Austin to Washington, DC. The journey started in June 1977 and ended at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in September. Despite making the case in Texas and nationally for the rights of Texas farm workers the union never found the financial support needed to continue as a viable labor union. Legacy For the few years this union was in existence it struggled to survive and support itself being officially independent and lacking support from its natural allies in the United Farm Workers Union or fellow unionists in the AFL-CIO. With little or no funding, the union captured media attention thanks to the charismatic figure of Orendain and its high-profile legislative campaign and marches. The union focused attention in Texas on the plight of farmworkers in a state more or less abandoned and ignored by the United Farm Workers Union based in California which claimed to speak for all farm workers, yet failed to work to organize them outside of California with any sustained effort or resource commitment. The TFWU was not an entity of the controversial National Labor Federation, as the Texas Farmworkers Union came into being long before Antonio Orendain and Gino Perente, (of the Eastern Service Workers Association), became acquainted and offered each other moral support in their common labor struggles.

Archaeology in Australia takes three main forms, Aboriginal archaeology (the archaeology of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia before and after European settlement), historical archaeology (the archaeology of Australia after European settlement) and maritime archaeology. Bridging these sub-disciplines is the important concept of cultural heritage management which encompasses Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites, historical sites and maritime sites. Research and investigations Archaeological studies or investigations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and culture in Australia have had many different agendas through time. Initial archaeological investigation was often focused on finding the oldest sites. By the 1970s, archaeological research was concerned with the environment and the way it impacted on humans. In the late 1970s cultural heritage management gained prominence, with the increasing demands by Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups for representation in archaeological research. At a research level the focus shifted to cultural change of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people through time. Currently, archaeological research places great importance on Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's viewpoints on the land and history of Australia. Consideration is given to Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's belief that archaeological sites are not just capsules of the past but a continuation from the past to the present. Therefore, at a research level significance is placed on the past but also on the importance of the present. The first settlement of Australia is a popular research topic both in archaeology and in the public arena. There is consensus that no human or closely related species evolved independently in Australia. This is because there have been no species of primate found in Australia, either in the present or in the fossil record. It is therefore assumed that the first settlers of Australia came from outside. At present the fossil record suggests that the first settlers were Homo sapiens, or fully modern humans. There is controversy over where the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people originated. Both of the two main theories postulate that the first settlers were fully modern humans. Asian genetic studies have demonstrated that there are similarities between Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Melanesians and Indians. However, the suggested date of 60,000 years ago for initial settlement is quite early when compared to other areas of the world. This may suggest that the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population derive from an early African population which migrated along the south coast of Asia, at a much faster rate than other populations migrating across the continents of the Holocene. The first settlement of Australia most likely occurred during the last glacial maximum. During this time Australia and New Guinea were joined as a single land mass called Sahul. The south-east Asian continent and islands were also joined as a single land mass called Sunda. It is theorised that the first Australians crossed the sea between Sahul and Sunda about 60,000 to 40,000 years ago. Other dates have been suggested, and this timeframe is not seen as conclusive. Sunda and Sahul had a permanent water-crossing, meaning that the first Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had to make a crossing on the open sea (see Wallace Line). Sahul is important in that in the past Australia was not an isolated continent, but was joined with New Guinea (and Tasmania). As such, New Guinea has also been the focus of archaeological investigations by Australian researchers. The most important early sites in Australia are: * Rottnest Island (70,000 years old) * Nauwalabila (55,000 – 60,000 years old) * Madjedbebe (65,000 years ago) * Devil's Lair (45,000 years old) * Lake Mungo (61,000 or 40,000 years old) – controversy exists over precise dating (see below) *Warratyi (49,000 years old) The change in sea levels means that the first settlements located on the coast would have been submerged. With the settlement of Australia, it is most probable that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people first settled on the northern coast, as this is the area closest to Asia. However, the actual spread of people and the settlement of the continent is debated, with three major models put forward: * Concentric dispersal through the entire continent through one single \\"entry\\" point. * Coastal dispersal by spreading along the coastline and later entering inland areas, mainly via the major waterways. * Fluctuating colonisation in and out of different environmental zones. For example, in plentiful years the population would occupy semi-arid regions, but in drought would move to areas with better resources. =Controversies in Aboriginal archaeology= Date of arrival There is significant debate over the date of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian continent. Until the 1950s it was often believed that arrival of the first Aboriginal people was within the last 10,000 years. In the 1950s, the dates were extended to the last Ice Age, based upon falling sea-levels at that period and the existence of landbridges linking the islands of the Sunda Shelf and the Sahul Continental Shelf with Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania. The discovery and use of C14 dating extended the dating to 40,000 years at Lake Mungo, and this was the date most frequently given. However, more recently, the analysis of sea levels has shown that coastlines 40,000 years ago were not as exposed as they were 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. The submergence of the earliest sites of occupation due to rising sea levels has meant that the earliest archaeological signature may in fact represent occupation much later than the initial time of arrival.Hiscock, P. (2008). Archaeology of Ancient Australia, London; New York: Routledge The difficulty in establishing a date of arrival earlier than 50,000 years has been compounded by the widespread use of radiocarbon dating and the supposed \\"radiocarbon barrier\\" which establishes 40,000 years as a limit to which C14 dates can be easily and reliably extracted. This limitation has prompted many archaeologists, including Rhys Jones and Alan Thorne, to include thermoluminescence dating methods in their studies of early occupation sites. It is argued that 60,000 to 70,000 years best fits the evidence from the Human genome diversity project and a number of other new dating technologies. Some have proposed dates extending back 100,000 to 120,000 years, but these dates are criticised on technical grounds and are not accepted by most scientists. A recent study by Eske Willesev of the University of Copenhagen, of the genome of an Aboriginal man from the Western Australian Goldfields confirms that the Aboriginal population separated from the early human stock 70,000 years ago, in Africa or from Oman, and travelled fairly rapidly across south and south eastern Asia to arrive in Australia at least 50,000 years ago, before a second wave travelled into Europe and Asia, receiving some input from the Aboriginal people who had already made that journey.http://geogenetics.ku.dk/latest- news/aboriginals-get-new-history/ accessed 2/22016 Multiple arrivals Earlier anthropologists believed that there were \\"three waves\\" of arrival of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to Australia, the first being the \\"negrito\\" Tasmanian people, who were displaced by \\"Murrayans\\", who in turn were considered to be displaced by \\"Carpentarians\\". These theories were sometimes advocated to disprove the Aboriginal claim to being the indigenous \\"first peoples\\". The fact that modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people cannot explain the Bradshaw figures of North Western Australia was also seen as evidence of displacement of earlier peoples by later arrivals. The finding of a robust skeleton with surprisingly so-called \\"primitive\\" features at Kow Swamp was also advocated as proof of an earlier wave of settlers to the continent. Dating of the Kow Swamp material, however, showed that rather than being earlier, it was in fact a lot more recent than the nearby Mungo gracile skeletons that more closely resembled modern Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Today it is thought that Aboriginal people throughout the continent are descendants of an original founder population, although this does not completely exclude some contribution from later arrivals. For example, on the basis of genomic analysis, it has been found that 4–500 years ago a small band from the Indian sub-continent traveled to northern Australia and contributed to the genome of people living in the north. At that time the appearance of the backed blade tradition, the dingo and other cultural features have been attributed to the arrivals. Nevertheless, it now appears that rather than a connection with the Indian pariah dogs, as previously thought, the dingo shows a greater connection to the dogs of East Asia, and the genetic bottleneck through which they passed may have been due to a single pregnant female, introduced through Austronesian connections 5,000 years ago. Megafauna extinction Some researchers, such as Tim Flannery, have put forward the idea that human settlement was responsible for the large climatic and environmental changes that occurred in Australia.Flannery, Tim (2002), \\"The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australasian Lands and People.\\" (Grove Press) The extent and causes of the Australian megafaunal extinction—generally placed in the Late Pleistocene—continues as an active debate and is a preoccupation among archaeologists and palaeontologists working in the Australian scene. Besides ongoing attempts to refine the dating and extent of the extinction event(s), much research is actively directed towards establishing whether, or to what extent, anthropogenic effects played a part in the disappearance of dozens of species of large-bodied animals formerly inhabiting the continent. Central to this question is a determination of how long humans and the megafauna species coexisted. Many factors have been considered as possible causes of the extinction, ranging from environmental variables to entirely human-based activity. The most extreme theory is that Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were completely responsible for the extinction of these animals through extensive hunting. This theory is largely based on the overkill hypothesis of the Americas, where hunters travelled through the land exterminating megafauna. The overkill hypothesis is largely discredited (and not just in Australia), as there have been no confirmed discoveries of kill sites, sites that are found in other contexts around the world and associated with megafauna hunting. The sites of Cuddie Springs in New South Wales, and Keilor in Victoria, display some evidence of associations between Aboriginal stone tools and megafauna remains, but do not prove conclusively the overkill theory. Furthermore, the coexistence of Aboriginal populations with the megafauna tends to contradict the overkill hypothesis.D.R.Horton, \\"Red kangaroos: Last of the Australian megafauna\\" (CSA Illumina) These writers suggest \\"threshold (for megafauna dieoff) was crossed between 26,000 and 15,000 yr B.P. when the arid area expanded further than usual and water resources in the woodland areas were severely reduced\\", although this finding is disputed by Roberts et al.Roberts R.G. (2001), \\"New Ages for the Last Australian Megafauna: Continent-Wide Extinction About 46,000 Years Ago\\" (Science, 8 June 2001: Vol. 292 no. 5523 pp. 1888–1892)Miller, Gifford et al (1999), \\"Pleistocene Extinction of Genyornis newtoni: Human Impact on Australian Megafauna\\" (Science 8 January 1999: Vol. 283 no. 5399 pp. 205–208) It is clear from paleobotanical and palaeontological evidence that the extinction coincided with great environmental change. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire. Approximately 18,000 to 7,000 years ago, many societies around the world underwent significant change; in particular, this time marks the rise of agriculture in many Neolithic societies. In the Australian context environmental change did not give rise to the development of agriculture but it may have contributed to the disappearance of populations of animals made even more vulnerable to depletion through hunting and marginalised grazing. Lake Mungo dating Arguably the oldest human remains in Australia, the Lake Mungo 3 skull was given the age of 60,000 years by Gregory Adcock and his researchers. However, this claim has been criticised, largely due to the process used to analyse the skull and the claims regarding the dating and the mtDNA found.Brown, Peter. (2005). Lake Mungo 3 . Retrieved 9 January 2006 Most people suggest that the age of the specimen is approximately 40,000 years. Sensitivities to handling Aboriginal remains means that specimens are not available for further research, so reassessment of the date awaits the development of appropriate ethical protocols. The intensification debate The idea of intensification was put forward by a number of archaeologists, but the most prominent in developing the idea was Harry Lourandos. Intensification is an idea that posits that change in economic systems of peoples is controlled by social changes. This means that change can occur without an external force such as environmental change. The idea is derived from a 1990s debate about the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and whether large social/economic change was caused by environmental factors (see Environmental determinism), or from factors within the society.Lourandos, Harry. (1997). Continent of Hunter-Gatherers. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. The predominant view at the time held that in the case of the Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people any social change was largely influenced by external, largely environmental, factors. The evidence that supports this idea is that sites at approximately the same time (around 4,000 years ago) experienced increased usage. This is supported by increased site numbers, increased artefact density and an expansion into new environments. This evidence better explained as an artefact of archaeological research and conflation of independent events, by environmental factors, large population growth, technological change, or post-depositional factors. The cultivation question Kent Flannery's modelKent Flannery, \\"Origins and Ecological Effects of Early Domestication in Iran and the Near East,\\" The Domestication and Exploitation of Plants and Animals, eds. Peter J. Ucko and G.W. Dimbleby (Chicago: Aldine Publishing Co., 1969), 73–100 of the broad spectrum revolution in which foragers diversified the types of food sources harvested, broadening their subsistence base outward to include more fish, small game, water fowl, invertebrates likes snails and shellfish, as well as previously ignored or marginal plant sources, would seem to apply to Australian hunters and gatherers. These changes were linked to climatic changes, including sea level rises during the Flandrian transgression in which: # Conditions became more inviting to marine life offshore in shallow, warm waters. # Quantity and variety of marine life increased drastically as did the number of edible species. # Because the rivers' power weakened with rising waters, and the creation of many estuaries, the currents flowing into the ocean were slow enough to allow fish to ascend upstream to spawn. # Birds found refuge next to riverbeds in marsh grasses and then proceeded to migrate to different habitats. Aboriginal people had a good understanding of local ecologies, and harvested many varieties of plants and animals in season. W.E.Roth talks about driving kangaroos into a 3 sided enclosure of nets \\"with the assistance of numerous beaters\\". Wallabies and emus were also caught in a similar way. Wallaroos were hunted with fire and beaten towards a creek, where they were killed with spears and sticks.Roth W.E. Food: Its Search, Capture and Preparation: North Queensland Ethnography Bulletin No.3 1901. Animals were also driven towards set nets and fish traps were common.Davis G (Nungabana) The Mullunburra: people of the Mulgrave River. Cassowary Publications. 2001 The degree to which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the Australian continent practised agriculture has long been debated by archaeologists. Earlier it was believed that Australian Aboriginal people were ignorant of the principles of agriculture, but this has since been disproven. For instance, Australian Aboriginal women in traditional societies often transplanted immature \\"bush tucker\\" plants found growing in unfavourable locations to more favourable spots. There were also a number of plants (particularly seeds and roots) that could have lent themselves to cultivation, and were used in making such foods as damper. Charles Sturt in his 1844 expedition to northwest New South Wales and central Australia reports seeing large haystacks built by Aboriginal people of seed crops. This was located east of Depot Glen Milparinka about 600 km from the Murray River. Firestick farming has also always been a technique used by Aboriginal people to open the canopy of closed canopy forests, introducing sunlight to the ground, and prompting germination of a number of foodstuffs known to attract kangaroo and other marsupials. This would encourage a more intensive land use than otherwise. But the main reason for the lack of agriculture in Australia is the extreme variability of the climate. Australia is the only continent on Earth, which, as a result of the El Nino Southern Oscillation, experiences greater variability between years than it does between the seasons. Such climatic variability makes farming very difficult, especially for incipient farmers who cannot be supported from outside their community. Australian Aboriginal people found that maintaining stable populations below the effective carrying capacity of the environment would enable an adequate supply of food, even in drought years, so maintaining a stable culture. This made hunting and gathering a more sustainable activity on the Australian continent than neolithic farming. Evidence of cultivation at Kuk in Papua New Guinea, from about 10–12,000 years BP (at a time when that island was joined to Australia, suggests crop raising was possible in the Sahul supercontinent when conditions were favourable. Historical archaeology in Australia Historical archaeology is the study of the past through material remains such as artefacts (i.e. objects), structures (e.g. standing and ruined buildings, fences, roads), features (e.g. ditches, mounds, canals, landfill), and even whole landscapes modified by human activity and their spatial and stratigraphic contexts. The origins of historical archaeology in Australia are generally held to lie in archaeological investigations by the late William (Bill) Culican at Fossil Beach in Victoria, in Jim Allen's PhD research at Port Essington in the Northern Territory and in Judy Birmingham's work at Irrawang Pottery in the Hunter Valley of NSW. An increasingly important area of Australian historical archaeology studies the interaction between European and other settlers, and Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Underwater and maritime archaeology in Australia Underwater archaeology is archaeology practised in a submerged environment. It encompasses the pre-historic and historic eras, including post-World War II. Maritime archaeology (the study of humans and their activities in, on, around and under the seas, rivers and estuaries) and nautical archaeology (the specialised study of boat and ship construction) are allied sub-disciplines of archaeology as a whole. Often the sites or relics are not inundated, however. In mirroring their terrestrial roots, underwater, maritime and nautical archaeology can now include the examination of a wide range of sites ranging from the Indigenous through to industrial archaeology, including historic submerged aircraft. Better known as a sub-discipline of aviation archaeology, underwater aviation archaeology is arguably the most recent offshoot of underwater archaeology, having developed its theoretical underpinnings and a substantial corpus of fieldwork, research and publication work in the late 1990s. Maritime archaeology, the first of these sub-disciplines to emerge in Australia, commenced under the aegis of Jeremy Green in the 1970s after concerns were expressed by academics and politicians over the rampant destruction of Dutch and British East Indian ships lost on the west coast. After Commonwealth legislation was enacted and enforced after 1976 and the states enacted their own legislation, the sub-discipline spread throughout Australia, as a result of on-going funding by both the states and the Commonwealth. While also encompassing the study of port-related structures (e.g. jetties, anchorages), lighthouses, moorings, defences etc., initially the focus in maritime archaeology was solely on shipwrecks.Nash, M., (ed.) 2007. Shipwreck archaeology in Australia. UWA Press, Nedlands Now far broader in its scope, in some states maritime and underwater archaeology is managed by museums and in others by cultural heritage management units. There are also numerous practitioners in private practice, or acting as consultants. All practitioners operate under the aegis of the Australasian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA).Staniforth, M., & Nash, M., (eds.) 2006, Underwater Archaeology: Australian Approaches. Springer, NY Cultural heritage management Commercial or consulting archaeology (also termed cultural heritage management) only developed in earnest in Australia from the 1970s, with the advent of various state legislation requiring approvals for damage or disturbance to archaeological relics, such as the Aboriginal and Archaeological Relics Preservation Act 1972, in Victoria. The Victoria Archaeological Survey was established from the Relics Office in 1975. Historical Archaeology is generally protected by separate legislation, such as the New South Wales Heritage Act 1977, and the various other state counterparts. Cultural Heritage Management for archaeological sites is seen in the context of wider heritage issues, and follows the principles set out in the Burra Charter or the Australia ICOMOS charter for the conservation of places of cultural significance. From a handful of practitioners in the '70s, there are now more than 250 commercially based archaeologists in Australia. Again in Victoria, one of the first to establish was du Cros and associates (later absorbed by Biosis Research, renamed Biosis Pty Ltd in 2012). The Australian Association of Consulting Archaeologist Inc. (AACAI) is the professional body established in 1979 with presently about 50 full members. In New South Wales, companies such as Casey and Lowe and GML have specialised in large scale historical archaeological salvage. Consultancy archaeology is primarily driven by development, and so is often at the centre of controversy over ownership of heritage and in particular the conflicting objectives of conservation and development. Aboriginal communities often ascribe a special significance to the places where archaeological remains have been found. =Legal obligations in Australia= Protection and management of archaeology in Australia is controlled by Federal and State Government legislation including the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and the various state archaeological legislation such as Victoria's Heritage Act 1995 (covering historical archaeology) and the Aboriginal Heritage Act 2006. Several states maintain archaeological site inventories as the main management tool. The principle of most forms of archaeological legislation in Australia is to provide blanket protection for all archaeological remains and sites, whether or not they have been recorded, and use a system of permits and consents to control change to those sites. for Aboriginal archaeological sites, there is often a requirement for consultation with traditional owners, and they sometimes have a role in approving works that impact on archaeological sites. =Native title and land rights= Native title is formalised under The Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993 which establishes a framework for the protection and recognition of native title. The Australian legal system recognises native title where: *the rights and interests are possessed under traditional laws and customs that continue to be acknowledged and observed by the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people; *by virtue of those laws and customs, the Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people have a connection with the land or waters; and *the native title rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.

The rose is named for Dorothea Lady Banks, the wife of the botanist Sir Joseph Banks. Description left It is a scrambling shrubby vine growing vigorously to tall. Unlike most roses, it is practically thornless, though it may bear some prickles up to 5 mm long, particularly on stout, strong shoots. The leaves are evergreen, 4–6 cm long, with three to five (rarely seven) leaflets 2–5 cm long with a serrated margin. The flowers are small, 1.5–2.5 cm diameter, white or pale yellow and are fragrant. It is amongst the earliest flowering of all roses, usually appearing during May in the northern hemisphere, though cold weather can delay flowering. All Lady Banks' roses are said to smell of violets to varying degrees.Charlotte Testu The old roses , Paris, The Rustic house - Flammarion1984 () , p. 185.

Cultivation and uses Rosa banksiae has likely been grown in the gardens of China for hundreds of years. The species was introduced to Europe by William Kerr, who had been sent on a plant-hunting expedition by Sir Joseph Banks. He bought the first Lady Banks' Rose, subsequently named the white Lady Banks (R. banksiae var. banksiae) from the famous Fa Tee nursery in 1807.Graham Murphy A number of other forms were subsequently discovered growing in China, including R. banksiae var. normalis (see above), and R. banksiae 'Lutea', the yellow Lady Banks' rose (brought to Europe in 1824 by J. D. Parks). In 1993 this cultivar earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine, with portions of other plants and herbs (such as monkshood and Ligusticum wallichii) to make a liniment to treat a painful swelling of the joints. An R. banksiae planted in Tombstone, Arizona in 1885 is reputedly the world's largest rose bush.

It is defined as the ratio of a particle's sedimentation velocity to the applied acceleration causing the sedimentation. : s = \\\\frac{v_t}{a} The sedimentation speed v_t (in m/s) is also the terminal velocity. It is constant because the force applied to a particle by gravity or by a centrifuge (typically in multiples of tens of thousands of gravities in an ultracentrifuge) is balanced by the viscous resistance (or \\"drag\\") of the fluid (normally water) through which the particle is moving. The applied acceleration a (in m/s2) can be either the gravitational acceleration g, or more commonly the centrifugal acceleration \\\\omega^2 r.

Stokes' law applies to small spheres in an infinite amount of fluid. The centrifugal force is given by the equation: mrω2, where m is the excess mass of the particle over and above the mass of an equivalent volume of the fluid in which the particle is situated (see Archimedes' principle) and r is the distance of the particle from the axis of rotation.

The terminal velocity for a spherical particle is given by the equation: : {v_t} = \\\\frac{mr\\\\omega^2}{6\\\\pi \\\\eta r_0} Rearranging this equation gives the final formula: : s = \\\\frac{v_t}{r\\\\omega^2} = \\\\frac{m}{6\\\\pi \\\\eta r_0} The sedimentation coefficient has units of time, expressed in svedbergs. One svedberg is 10−13 s. The sedimentation coefficient normalizes the sedimentation rate of a particle to its applied acceleration. The result no longer depends on acceleration, but only on the properties of the particle and the fluid in which it is suspended. Sedimentation coefficients quoted in literature usually pertain to sedimentation in water at 20°C. The sedimentation coefficient is in fact the amount of time it would take the particle to reach its terminal velocity under the given acceleration if there were no drag. The above equation shows that is proportional to and inversely proportional to . Also for non-spherical particles of a given shape, is proportional to and inversely proportional to some specific dimension. For a given shape, is proportional to the size to the third power, so larger, heavier particles sediment faster and have higher svedberg, or s, values. Sedimentation coefficients are, however, not additive. When two particles bind together, the shape will be different from the shapes of the original particles. Even if the shape were the same, the ratio of excess mass to size would not be equal to the sum of the ratios for the starting particles. Thus, when measured separately they have svedberg values that do not add up to that of the bound particle. For example ribosomes are typically identified by their sedimentation coefficient. The 70 S ribosome from bacteria has a sedimentation coefficient of 70 svedberg, although it is composed of a 50 S subunit and a 30 S subunit.

This was the last album to feature Jason Porter on bass guitar, as he was replaced by Alistair MacLatchy in December 1996. As with the first album, the band only had around two weeks to record this album. They had major problems with recording the album: the temperature in the recording studio was so consistently high that the recording equipment broke down several times; and the record company, Cacophonous Records, refused to pay for new tape reels to record on, so the band had to actually record over the first album. The cover artwork for the album is a painting by the famed artist Joe Petagno, based on a concept by Bal-Sagoth vocalist/lyricist Byron Roberts. In the song titled \\"And Lo, When the Imperium Marches Against Gul-Kothoth, then Dark Sorceries Shall Enshroud the Citadel of the Obsidian Crown\\", a strong synthesizer melody begins at 4:17. This melody is a variation upon the melody heard in the 1982 film Conan the Barbarian during the scene inside Thulsa Doom's stronghold, composed by Basil Poledouris. Again from the score of Conan the Barbarian, at 00:37 in the track \\"Recovery\\", the theme seems to be faithfully adapted by Bal-Sagoth in the track \\"In the Raven-Haunted Forests of Darkenhold, Where Shadows Reign and the Hues of Sunlight Never Dance\\" at 2:02. The band explains their inspiration came mainly from John Williams and Basil Poledouris' scores amongst others. On 13 May 2016 the album was re-released by Cacophonous Records as a special edition CD featuring remastered audio, expanded lyric booklet, new sleeve notes and exclusive new artwork.

He led the Kansas City Orchestra, the most important of the regional, blues-based orchestras active in the Midwest in the 1920s, and helped to develop the riffing style that would come to define many of the 1930s Big Bands. Career Moten started making music from an early age and developed as a pianist, pulling together other musicians in a band. His first recordings were made (for OKeh Records) on September 23, 1923, and were rather typical interpretations of the New Orleans style of King Oliver and others. They also showed the influence of the ragtime that was still popular in the area, as well as the stomping beat for which his band was famous. These OKeh sides (recorded 1923–1925) are some of the more valuable acoustic jazz 78s of the era; they are treasured records in many serious jazz collections. They signed with Victor Records in 1926, and were influenced by the more sophisticated style of Fletcher Henderson. More often than not, their pieces featured a hard stomp beat that was extremely popular in Kansas City. Moten continued to be one of Victor's most popular orchestras through 1930. Their song \\"Kansas City Shuffle\\" was recorded during this time. (The band recorded prolifically, and many of their records were issued in Victor's regular series, not specifically marketed to the Black community as some other bands were.) By 1927, Moten's orchestra contained many names associated with Kansas City music, and included Harlan Leonard (alto sax), Jack Washington (alto and baritone sax), Ed Lewis and Lamar Wright (trumpets) and Willie McWashington (drums). His orchestra featured the standard Kansas City style at the time: smooth sax chorus over tinkling piano and a bass drum beat. Moten's popular 1928 recording of \\"South\\" on Victor V-38021 (itself a remake of the first version on OKeh from late 1924) stayed in Victor's catalog over the years. (It was reissued as 24893 in 1935, as Victor phased out any remaining V-38000 series that were still in the catalog.) In the late 1940s, it became a big jukebox hit (by then, reissued as 44-0004). It remained in print (as a vinyl 45) until RCA stopping making vinyl records. By 1928 Moten's piano was showing some boogie woogie influences, but the real revolution came in 1929, after he recruited Count Basie, Walter Page, and Oran 'Hot Lips' Page. Walter Page's walking bass lines gave the music an entirely new feel compared to the 2/4 tuba of his predecessor Vernon Page, colored by Basie's understated, syncopated piano fills. Another boon to the band was adding Jimmy Rushing as their primary vocalist. Their final session showed the early stages of what became known as the \\"Basie sound,\\" four years before Basie recorded under his own name. (They made 10 recordings at Victor's Camden, New Jersey, studios on December 13, 1932, during a time when the band was suffering significant financial hardship.) By this time Ben Webster and Rushing had joined Moten's band, but Moten himself did not play on these sessions. These sides were mostly arranged by Eddie Durham, and they include a number of tunes that later became swing classics: * \\"Toby\\" * \\"Moten Swing\\" * \\"The Blue Room\\" * \\"Imagination\\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) * \\"New Orleans\\" (vocal: Jimmy Rushing) * \\"The Only Girl I Ever Loved\\" (vocals: Sterling Russell Trio) * \\"Milenberg Joys\\" * \\"Lafayette\\" * \\"Prince of Wails\\" (often mistitled as \\"Prince of Wales\\") * \\"Two Times\\" (recorded with six musicians and with vocalist Josephine Garrison) Nathan W. Pearson Jr. summarized Bennie Moten's influence on Kansas City's jazz legacy: \\"Among Kansas City musicians . . . the city, the style, and the era of its flowering are virtually synonymous with the Bennie Moten Orchestra.\\" Death and legacy Moten died at Kansas City's Wheatley-Provident Hospital on April 2, 1935, following a failed tonsillectomy operation. The Afro-American, April 6, 1935 Basie took many of the leading musicians from the former Moten band to gather his own orchestra, which moved to New York in 1936. Band personnel The complete personnel of Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra, as of 1926-1927 when the band was at the peak of its early popularity, was: * Ed Lewis, trumpet * Lamar (or Lammar) Wright, trumpet Name originally spelled \\"Lamar\\" but commonly seen as \\"Lammar.\\" * Thamon Hayes, trombone * Harlan Leonard, alto sax * Jack Washington, alto and baritone saxes * Woodie Walder, tenor sax * Bennie Moten, piano * Leroy Berry, banjo * Vernon Page, tuba * Willie McWashington, drumsThis personnel is found on the cover of RCA's \\"Label X\\" reissue album Bennie Moten's Kansas City Jazz (Volume 1) (LVA-3004), which erroneously lists the tuba player as Walter Page.

It records the plight of a relatively poor girl from the English gentry who captures the attention of a very wealthy man by claiming to be an heiress; although he disbelieves her, he is amused by her presumption and character. The story is set in the spring of 1817. Plot summary Arabella, the beautiful daughter of a country vicar, sets out to London to have a season and make an advantageous marriage. On her way there, her carriage has an accident and she has to stop over at the hunting box of Robert Beaumaris, the Nonpareil of the town and one of the wealthiest men in England. Mr Beaumaris suspects the 'accident' to be a ruse on the part of someone chasing him for his fortune. Overhearing him make a remark to this effect, Arabella impulsively pretends to be an heiress. Mr. Beaumaris, knowing this to be untrue is amused by her daring to put him in his place, and decides to encourage his friend's belief in this falsehood. He is bored with Society and views the town cynically. He is also amused by the fact that society will follow whoever leads, irrespective of the wisdom of the person's behaviour. Arabella requests that Mr Beaumaris and his friend Lord Fleetwood not reveal her \\"fortune\\". She continues on her journey to London to stay with her godmother, Lady Bridlington, blithely believing that nothing will come of this interlude. However, Lord Fleetwood is not very discreet, and the town soon believes Arabella to be an heiress. To amuse himself, Mr Beaumaris decides to make Arabella the rage of the town by flirting with her and driving her out in his carriage. Arabella is aware that his intentions are not serious, but plays along because to be admired by him makes her a social success. Arabella feels that she cannot make a good match when all the town mistakenly believe her to be wealthy. Knowing that Mr Beaumaris can have no designs on her supposed fortune and is only amusing himself with her, she is most comfortable in his company. She enchants him with her unusual behaviour (which includes foisting a climbing boy and a mongrel on him) and the fact that she does not appear to fancy him. Mr Beaumaris eventually falls in love with Arabella and proposes. Arabella, not knowing him to be aware of her deception from the start, tearfully refuses, realising that she is indeed in love with him, but cannot reveal her deception without risking his love. Meanwhile, Arabella's brother Bertram has come to town on 100 pounds that he won. The wealthy friends he makes soon lead him into debt and Arabella decides she must accept Mr Beaumaris's proposal in order to pay off Bertram's debts. Mr Beaumaris guesses the cause of her sudden reversal and is amused, knowing her to be in love with him, despite the appearance of the situation. She insists they elope together since she's desperate and he agrees, but instead takes her to visit his grandmother's house. Once they arrive, she reveals that she is not a wealthy woman, he reveals that he knew all along and that he went to visit her family. All is resolved by the fact that his fortune is so massive, the lack of hers will never be noticed, and the lack of fortune for her brothers and sisters will be explained away by an eccentric uncle who left the money to Arabella. Analysis Mukul Kesavan of The Telegraph observed similarities between the character of Arabella and many of Heyer's other Regency heroines: while they all travel to London to find wealthy husbands, they do so on their own terms. Kesavan said, > \\"The remarkable thing about Heyer’s Regency novels is the way in which her > heroines manage not to dance the marriage minuet, their awkward refusal to > 'fit' the model of the eager, conforming debutante. Her heroines aren’t > revolutionaries or even proto-feminists: they accept the mannered marriage > market as the way of the world, but they work to make room for themselves > and their natures within its constraints.\\" Writing for Tor.com, Mari Ness stated that Arabella was notable for being one of the few of Heyer's novels to depict real signs of poverty. Ness wrote that Heyer > \\"decided to introduce a touch—a mere touch—of poverty, as if to acknowledge > that even in the idealistic Regency world of her creation, genuine, real > poverty could appear. And as if to immediately soften this, she surrounded > this poverty with witty dialogue, romantic banter, and what by all > appearances is the expected romantic ending.\\" In a 1949 review, The New York Times critiqued the novel for showing \\"no sign of the rough and sordid London of Swift and Defoe... Nor is there the least sign of the robustness and vitality that made those masters' creations come to life... Arabella and the Nonesuch are stereotypes from The Ladies Monthly Museum.\\" Ness considers Arabella to be a fan favourite, \\"with passages that are among [Heyer's] very best, and some of her most ironic writing. And up until those last pages, it is one of Heyer’s most delightful, comforting novels, filled with laugh out loud moments and sharp comments on human behavior.\\" Ness disliked the ending, especially as it seems that Beaumaris' will and superior social standing will be employed to overrule his new wife's criticism of London Society and willingness to aid the downridden.

Citing political infighting within the Anglican Catholic Church, four of its clergy sought the help of the Philippine church in consecrating them to be bishops of a daughter province in which each of them would serve as bishop ordinary of a diocese covering one-quarter of the United States. History In 1981, the PICC's ecumenical officer, Francisco J. Pagtakhan, consecrated, in San Diego, California, G. Wayne Craig of Ohio, Ogden Miller of Oregon, and Robert Q. Kennaugh of Texas. (The fourth candidate, Herman Nelson of Florida, asked for his consecration to be delayed. In 1985 he was received back into the ACC.) The Anglican Rite Jurisdiction of the Americas sought to consecrate bishops with valid orders in an unbroken lineage of apostolic succession (the PICC had Old Catholic Union of Utrecht orders) in order to serve the needs of conservative Episcopalians who objected to the revision of the 1928 Book of Common Prayer, to the ordination of women, and to the Episcopal Church's relaxation of traditional rules concerning marriage and sexuality. One of ARJA's hopes was to be a force for uniting other Continuing Anglican churches which had remained independent of the Anglican Catholic Church. Of the initial three bishops of the church, Miller and Kennaugh are deceased, and Craig retired in 1987. Along with his former parish in Columbus, Ohio, he subsequently joined the Episcopal Missionary Church (EMC). At its height, ARJA consisted of approximately a dozen parishes in the United States. In 1987, ARJA gained a diocese in Australia, headed by Kenneth Graydon, and in 1993 after ARJA's Archbishop Stephen Clark had visited England, they jointly began a missionary Diocese of Lambeth in London. Before its demise, this latter had several successive episcopal visitors and was administered by an archdeacon who later converted to Orthodoxy. When efforts to unite with other Continuing Anglican bodies repeatedly proved unsuccessful, and following the departure of most of its parishes to various other Continuing Anglican jurisdictions, the ARJA began conversations with the Episcopal Missionary Church. The EMC had been founded in the early 1990s by Donald Davies, a retired ECUSA bishop. The talks were successful and a merger of the remaining ARJA parishes and clergy was agreed upon, thus ARJA ceased to exist.

The type skeleton is complete to the thirteenth caudal vertebra, and so is relatively well understood, and is the most complete abelisaurid yet described. However, the skull is damaged, causing some paleontologists to speculate that it was involved in a fight prior to death. In 2009, Novas suggested that Aucasaurus garridoi might be a junior synonym of Abelisaurus comahuensis. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul renamed Aucasaurus garridoi into Abelisaurus garridoi. This has found no acceptance.  Description  Reconstruction Size compared to a human Aucasaurus short, deep-snouted skull was not as short or as deep-snouted as that of Carnotaurus. Also, instead of horns, it had a pair of low ridges above each eye. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated its body length at 5.5 metres, its weight at 700 kilograms.Paul, G.S., 2010. The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs. Princeton University Press. p. 79 In 2016, its length was estimated to be and at least 1.5 tons in weight (comparable to Skorpiovenator) but heavier than the other genus Ilokelesia, which was estimated to be 200-240 kilograms in weight. in a comprehensive analysis of abelisaur size. = Forelimbs and hands = The small arms of Aucasaurus were also like that of its horned relative, but were proportionally longer due to its small size, and the bones lacked the bony processes and some unusual proportions present in Carnotaurus. The hand of Aucasaurus was unusual: four metacarpals were present, but the first and fourth lacked fingers. The second and third had fingers, but they were quite short and had no claws. = Braincase = 3D scan of the braincase A study was done on the braincase of Aucasaurus in 2015 by Ariana Paulina-Carabajal and Cecilia Succar, in which the skull material was scanned using a medical CT machine. Virtual three-dimensional inner ear and cranial endocasts were obtained and visualized using the imagine software at the University of Alberta. A latex cranial endocast was also made. The forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain resemble the morphology described for the abelisaurids Majungasaurus and Indosaurus. However, Aucasaurus exhibits a floccular process that is relatively larger than that of Majungasaurus. In Aucasaurus the flocculus is enclosed in an 8-shaped floccular recess, similar in shape and size to that observed in Abelisaurus, suggesting that the two Patagonian taxa were capable of a slightly wider range of movements of the head. The labyrinth of the inner ear is similar in shape and size to the semicircular canals of Majungasaurus, although the lateral semicircular canal is shorter in Aucasaurus.  Discovery  Aucasaurus is known from finds in the Río Colorado Subgroup, a Late Cretaceous group comprising the Anacleto Formation in the Neuquén Basin of Argentina that has yielded many dinosaur fossils. Numerous sauropod eggs are also known from this deposit.  Classification  Aucasaurus was closely related to Carnotaurus and they are united in the Carnotaurini.

Having been raised with a passive, sickly mother and an intemperate, gambling addict father, Charles has assumed since a young age the role of the adult in the household. Forced by his father's debt to shoulder the family finances, he resents the disruption by his lively and confident cousin of what has become, in all but name, his household. With Charles encouraged in domestic tyranny by his spiteful fiancée, Miss Eugenia Wraxton, Sophy and Charles begin a battle of wills. Soon after her arrival, Sophy realizes that all is not well in the Rivenhall household and proceeds to solve the various problems of the family with her trademark flair, saving her cousin Hubert from a moneylender, arranging through an involved and hilarious scheme her cousin Cecilia's extraction from her infatuation with (and later engagement to) a poet, and promoting her marriage to the eligible Lord Charlbury, the man favored by her brother and parents and ultimately, the man Cecilia discovers she loves. Slowly, much to the consternation of both, Sophy and Charles find themselves falling in love, with Sophy's devilry lightening his dictatorial tendencies. In the end, at the successful conclusion of her audacious scheme to unite Cecilia and Charlbury and free Rivenhall from his obligations to his fiancée, Rivenhall proposes, with Sophy accepting.

Theodore Roosevelt, who was president during the peak of White's career, described White as \\"the most useful man in the entire diplomatic service, during my Presidency and for many years before.\\" Colonel House, the chief aide to Woodrow Wilson, called White \\"the most accomplished diplomatist this country has ever produced.\\" Early life A native of Baltimore, White was born into a wealthy and socially well-connected Maryland family, the son of John Campbell White and his wife Eliza Ridgely, and the grandson of another Eliza Ridgely. (As a boy, White was taken by his grandfather to meet then- President Franklin Pierce.) White spent much of his childhood at Hampton, the Maryland estate of his grandparents, today run by the National Park Service.Ridgely bios from Hampton National Historic Site website During the Civil War, the family's sympathies were with the Confederacy. After the war ended in 1865 with a Confederate defeat, White's family moved to France, where White finished his education in Paris. Five years later, war once again set the Whites to flight, moving to Britain after the fall of Napoleon III during the Franco-Prussian War. Because White showed signs of ill health after the move to Britain, he was ordered by his doctor to maintain a vigorous athletic regimen outdoors. These orders led White to become an avid fox hunter; an avocation that in turn allowed him to meet many of the leading figures in Victorian Britain . He continued to hunt until his marriage, in 1879, to Margaret \\"Daisy\\" Stuyvesant Rutherfurd.She was the daughter of astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd and his wife, Margaret Stuyvesant Chanler, the sister of John Winthrop Chanler, U.S. Representative from New York, (and a descendant of Peter Stuyvesant). Career =Early diplomatic career= White's new wife was an ambitious and hard-working woman who encouraged her husband to pursue the career in diplomacy in which his years in Europe had interested him. After his marriage, White moved back to the United States after 14 years living overseas. Using the relationships he developed fox hunting, as well as the contacts possessed by his and his wife's families, he expressed his interest in getting a diplomatic post. After three years of networking, White's efforts were rewarded in the summer of 1883 with the secretaryship of the U.S. legation in Vienna, working under minister Alphonso Taft. At the end of the year, he was promoted to be second secretary of the far more important U.S. legation in London, working under minister James Russell Lowell; a post he kept even after a Democratic victory in the 1884 presidential election led to Lowell, like White a Republican appointee, being turned out of office in 1885. White was even promoted, to first secretary of the legation, in 1886. After seven years in that post, under ministers Edward J. Phelps, Robert T. Lincoln, and Thomas F. Bayard, White was removed from office for political reasons in October 1893. =American interlude= After stepping down in London, White and his family returned to the United States, a country which White had lived in for only three of the past 27 years. The family moved to Washington, D.C., where White laid the groundwork for a return to the diplomatic service. Throughout White's diplomatic career, his prospects were helped by the social grace of himself and his wife. As a bachelor, White had ingratiated himself with the British sporting set. As a married couple, Henry and Margaret White had been popular with British intellectuals, and were charter members of The Souls. The Whites now made themselves welcome in salons throughout Washington, making or renewing friendships with Theodore Roosevelt, John Hay, Chauncey Depew, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Levi P. Morton, among many others. These relationships White had formed with both British and American leaders were what made him an invaluable diplomat. White was able to serve as an unusually effective intermediary between the British and American governments because he was known and trusted by both sides. During the years when White was active in the United Kingdom, both the British and the American governments wanted close relations with the other, so White was able to use his ability to mediate with greatest effect. =Back in the diplomatic service= William McKinley's election to the presidency in 1896 brought White back into a government post. McKinley offered White the position of U.S. minister to Spain, but White chose to return to his old position as first secretary at the London embassy, where Hay was now the ambassador (the U.S. diplomatic mission in London had been upgraded from a legation to an embassy in 1895). When Hay was recalled to Washington in 1898 for a promotion to Secretary of State, White had hoped to become ambassador, but that position went to Joseph H. Choate instead. As acting chargé d'affaires while awaiting Choate's arrival, White played a key role in the negotiations leading to the Hay–Pauncefote Treaty. In 1899, Margaret White was struck down by a degenerative nerve disease. She would recover only partially, and spent much of her time away at resorts, conserving her strength. For the next 10 years, the Whites' daughter Muriel would fill in as hostess during her mother's absences. He received an honorary degree from the University of St Andrews in October 1902, during the ceremonial when Andrew Carnegie was installed as Lord Rector. =Ambassadorial years= On March 6, 1905, White received his long- awaited promotion to Ambassador, as President Roosevelt named him to represent the United States with Italy. While Ambassador to Italy, White served as the lead U.S. mediator during the 1906 Algeciras Conference. The agreement reached during that conference averted a war between France and Germany over economic rights in Morocco. On December 19, 1906, White received another promotion from Roosevelt, this time to be the U.S. ambassador to France, replacing Robert Sanderson McCormick who retired due to his health. He stayed in that position until President Taft took office in 1909 and requested his resignation. =Semi-retirement= White remained active in U.S. diplomacy after leaving Paris. He accompanied Roosevelt on the now-former President's tour of Europe in 1910, serving as Roosevelt's de facto chief of staff during visits to Paris and Berlin and during Roosevelt's service as the U.S. special representative to the funeral of King Edward VII. During the trip, Roosevelt and White met with every major chief of state in Europe except Tsar Nicholas II. In 1910, White also accepted an assignment from Taft to head the U.S. delegation to the Pan-American Conference in Buenos Aires. As a result of his discussions with Latin American diplomats, White wrote a strong recommendation to Secretary of State Philander C. Knox that these diplomats be treated with more respect and tact. White became an active member of the Pan-American Society after returning from Buenos Aires. In between diplomatic missions, White supervised the construction of a new mansion in Washington, D.C., designed by John Russell Pope. Later known as the White-Meyer House, it is today part of the Meridian International Center.History of the property from the Meridian International Center website The house, located off 16th Street, was near many of the city's foreign embassies, and White actively socialized with ambassadors from around the world. =World War I= White's daughter had married Graf (Ernst Hans Christoph Roger) Hermann von Seherr- Thoss,Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Gräfliche Häuser, von Hueck, Walter, C. A. Starke Verlag, Limburg an der Lahn, 1991, p. 324. a German aristocrat, in 1909, and White was in Germany visiting them when World War I started in 1914. He and his wife were sequestered in Berlin for two weeks, and then were able to leave for home via the Netherlands with their daughter's two children, who spent the first two years of the war in the United States. Because White had strong ties to both Britain and Germany, he remained neutral in his sympathies during the early years of the war, an attitude which gradually made him a supporter of President Woodrow Wilson, who also advocated neutrality and peace. In 1914, the Wilson administration asked White first to head the American delegation to the 1914 Pan-American Conference and later to serve as Minister to Haiti. White declined both offers, though, and stayed out of diplomacy during these years because of the rapidly declining health of his wife, who died on September 2, 1916. When Germany declared that it would conduct unrestricted submarine warfare against U.S. ships, White realized that U.S. entry into the war was inevitable, and he supported it wholeheartedly. When the French sent a special military mission, headed by Marshal Joffre, to the United States after the declaration of war, White hosted the mission in his mansion. =American Peace Commissioner= On November 19, 1918, shortly after the declaration of the Armistice, White received a surprise invitation from President Wilson to serve as one of the five American Peace Commissioners, who would go to France to work on the peace treaty with Germany. Wilson extended the invitation because White was a Republican yet still a supporter of Wilson's peace aims. Wilson also valued White as being the most experienced American diplomat of the time, and a man who knew most of the European leaders with whom the Commission would deal. The Commission arrived in Paris on December 14. White talked with dignitaries from across Europe to learn what various groups wanted and what they would accept. He also sought unsuccessfully to find a common ground between Wilson and the Senate Republicans (led by Lodge) who would be in a position to reject the treaty Wilson was negotiating. After the peace treaty with Germany was signed (the U.S. Senate later refused to ratify it), Wilson and Secretary of State Robert Lansing returned to the United States, leaving White to lead the delegation in drafting the peace treaties with Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria until he could be relieved of command by the Assistant Secretary of State. After five more months of work, White and the remainder of the delegation left Paris on December 9, 1919. Upon his return to the United States, White continued to try to bring Wilson and Lodge together to compromise and get the treaty approved by the Senate. On March 19, 1920, however, the Senate rejected the treaty. =Retirement= The rejection of the treaty ended White's diplomatic career, though he continued to be active in public life, as a trustee for the National Geographic Society, the Corcoran Gallery, and the Smithsonian Institution, among other organizations. White also continued to correspond and host friends from the diplomatic and political worlds. White was a member of the Knickerbocker Club from 1876 until his death. Personal life Portrait of White's first wife, Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd, by John Singer Sargent, 1883 On December 3, 1879, Henry married Margaret Stuyvesant Rutherfurd (1853–1916). She was the daughter of Lewis Morris Rutherfurd and sister of Stuyvesant Rutherfurd and Winthrop Rutherfurd. Before his wife's eventual death in 1916, they had two children together: * Margaret Muriel White (1880–1943), who married Count Ernst Hans Christoph Roger Hermann Seherr- Thoss, a Prussian aristocrat, in Paris on April 28, 1909, and lived in Germany for the rest of her life. * John Campbell White (1884–1967), married Elizabeth Moffat. He served in the U.S. Foreign Service as a diplomat from 1914 to 1945, and was United States Ambassador to Haiti (1941–1944) and Peru (1944–1945). On November 3, 1920, White remarried, to Emily Vanderbilt Sloane, the widow of William D. Sloane. Emily was the daughter of William Henry Vanderbilt (1821–1885) and Maria Louisa Kissam (1821–1896), and the granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt (1794–1877). In 1926, White's health began to fail, and he spent much of his time confined to bed. He died a few hours after undergoing an operation. His widow died on July 29, 1946 in Lenox, Massachusetts. White's body was buried in the National Cathedral in Washington D.C., near the tomb of Woodrow Wilson. References ;Notes ;Sources * Nevins, Allan (1930).

French forces were led by Jacques MacDonald, while the Austrians and their Bavarian allies, forming the Army of Bohemia, were led by Karl Philipp Fürst zu Schwarzenberg. The Austrians were victorious. Napoleon I himself, having defeated the Allies at Montereau on 17 February, forcing them to retreat toward Troyes beyond the river Aube, had turned north to the valley of the Marne to try to impede the renewed drive toward Paris by the Army of Silesia (mostly Prussians) under Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher; the marshals he left behind were ordered to make it appear as though he was still with them. Schwarzenberg tested that assumption by advancing upon Bar-sur-Aube (in part because Alexander I of Russia and Frederick William III of Prussia wanted him to do so), and on the twenty-sixth Napoleon ordered Oudinot to follow Schwarzenberg to the town, near Troyes. When it was learned that Napoleon was preparing to attack the Army of Silesia, Schwarzenberg took the opportunity to strike first at Oudinot with a Russian corps under General Peter Wittgenstein and a Bavarian corps under General Karl von Wrede. Although MacDonald enjoyed a measure of numerical superiority at the outset, many of his troops were cut off from the main theater of the battle by their deployment astride the Aube and were therefore unable to participate, much of the French artillery being stuck on the wrong side of the river. Not only was MacDonald forced to retreat over the Aube, but he continued retreating for the next few days, pursued by the Allies and leaving Schwarzenberg in an advantageous position, able to concentrate his forces at Troyes as well as to take possession of the river crossings of the Seine. A Russian cavalry officer, Eduardo von Lowenstern, witnessed the revenge the Bavarians took on the town for the loss of a battalion: “The houses were being stormed.

Frontlined by singer Francesca Nicoli, it combines modern technology with archaic instrumentation. The lyrical themes are frequently drawn from nature and ancient cultures. History The band was founded by Francesca Nicoli and Michele Urbano in November 1985. In the first five years there were many musicians in the band, until finally Francesca Nicoli, Vittorio Vandelli, and Giovanni Pagliari became the basic line-up until today. Style and lyrical themes The band combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation over various media. The members have said they have dedicated their lives to art, to explore the nobleness of centuries in many possible ways (music, poetry, theatre, and photography). They define themselves as \\"craftsmen of the sound\\" because they create an unusual mix of sacred and profane, atmospheric and experimental, contemporary and early music, using acoustic and electric instruments as well, always with such language which fits best to the actual work. The word ataraxia is taken from Epicurean philosophy and means \\"equanimity\\", \\"calmness\\" and \\"unflappability\\". Ataraxia place themselves in a spiritual tradition from Greco-Roman and Celtic cultures. Nicoli has described the production process as \\"medianic\\" and associated it with the cult of Dionysus, where \\"the musician was possessed by the God of Nature who spoke through him/her\\". Regarding the band's pagan themes, Nicoli associates the word paganism with the countryside, and maintains that life in the countryside creates a connection to the rhythm of nature. In that sense, she considers Atarax a pagan band: \\"I feel that I'm in a communion with that which surrounds me\\".

Throughout the day, Polish forces under Jan Skrzynecki fought for the control over the town of Ostrołęka against the assaulting Russian forces of Hans Karl von Diebitsch. Although by the end of the day the town was still in Polish hands and the two sides suffered comparable losses, the battle is usually considered a Polish defeat because of the Russian army's almost unlimited strategic reinforcement capability. The Polish Army could not similarly replenish its casualties. In the event, surviving Polish forces were saved by the particularly brave stand of its 4th Line Infantry Regiment, the \\"Czwartacy\\", who repelled several waves of enemy infantry and cavalry charges, holding the burning town during heavy fighting in close quarters. By late evening the Poles were again saved by a self- sacrificing charge of the 4th battery of mounted artillery led by Lt.Col. Józef Bem. The battle On the morning of 26 May, most of the Polish army was west of the Narew River except for General Tomasz Łubieński's 5th Infantry Division (part of the II Corps), and General Ludwik Bogusławski's 4th Regiment of Line Infantry, which were still east of Ostrołęka.Leszczyński, p. 207 Łubieński's orders from Ignacy Prądzyński was to \\"defend yourself through the day to come\\", despite facing Russian forces four times his size. The danger, according to the commanding officer of the Polish Cavalry Brigade, General Karol Turno, was in being trapped and pushed into the river as occurred in the Battle of Berezina.Leszczyński, p. 208 The Russian army made contact at 06:00 with the arrival of forces under General Georg von Nostitz, and the battle began at 09:00 when Fyodor Berg arrived, with the Poles offering strong resistance, forcing Nostitz to wait for the arrival of the rest of Field Marshal Diebitsch's forces, which included Generals Nabokov, Lopuchin, Manderstern and Shakhovskoy.Leszczyński, pp. 209-210 By 10:00, Łubieński was forced back to Ostrołęka on the Narew, with some protection from Prądzyński's guns and veterans located on the sandy hills to the west.Leszczyński, pp. 211-212 The Polish headquarters were moved to Kruki, further to the west, on the Omulew River, a tributary of the NarewLeszczyński, p. 215 Skrzynecki ordered Bogusławski to \\"defend the town to the death\\" with mainly the 4th Infantry Regiment (known by its nickname of \\"Czwartacy\\" – lit. \\"those of the Fourth\\") and two batteries of four cannons each.Leszczyński, p. 216 The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment were deployed south of Ostrołęka, opposite the road to Rzekuń, the 3rd Battalion on the road to Goworki and the 4th Battalion protecting the bridges.Leszczyński, p. 218 The 3rd Battalion took up defence inside the St. Anthony's Bernardine Monastery near the market, the only brick building in Ostrołęka.Leszczyński, p. 222 By 11:00 Diebitsch had arrived and ordered the 1st Cuirasseur Guard Division to attack from the northern highway while the Astrakhan Grenadier Regiment attacked from Rzekuń to the south, forcing the 1st and 4th Battalions to retreat in disarray, exposing the bridges, and forcing the \\"Czwartacy\\" in to help as the fighting moved in the direction of the market, almost trapping the Poles.Leszczyński, pp. 219 and 222-223 The constant cannonade caught buildings on fire, forcing the inhabitants to flee into the streets and market where the battle was raging and \\"Ostrołęka would begin more and more to resemble hell\\". Finally, Bogusławski ordered a retreat to the bridges, only to find they were in the process of being dismantled, forcing some of his soldiers to cross the river by swimming.Leszczyński, p. 224 His defence had lasted only an hour and was disastrous for the 4th Infantry Regiment, having lost 16 officers and 782 soldiers killed, wounded or captured. Diebitsch now had the opportunity of using the bridges the Poles did not have time to dismantle, to cross the Narew.Leszczyński, p. 226 By now, Karl Wilhelm von Toll had 62 guns sweeping the valiant Poles and Diebitsch ordered the Astrakhan Regiment to cross the river using boards from the Ostrołęka homes to repair the damaged bridges.Leszczyński, p. 230 Ludwik Michał Pac then gathered remnants of the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment, at 12:00, along with the 3rd Infantry Division to fight for the bridges.Leszczyński, pp. 228 and 230 At 13:00, Maciej Rybiński's 1st Infantry Division was called in to help defend the bridges.Leszczyński, p. 236 At 15:00, Skrzynecki called for an ill-fated cavalry attack, the remnants of which were withdrawn by 17:00.Leszczyński, pp. 243 and 246 By 18:00, the remnants of the 5th Infantry Division retreated in disorder to the rear, by which time two heroes, Ludwik Kicki and Henryk Ignacy Kamieński were dead.Leszczyński, pp. 246 and 253 A German poem glorifying the 4th Regiment's actions at Ostrołęka The battle on a 19th-century gravure by Georg Benedikt Wunder At 19:00, Lt. Col. Józef Bem and Henryk Dembiński manoeuvred to make the Russians think the Poles still had hidden behind the hills reserve forces which would cost Diebitsch dearly if he continued to advance.Leszczyński, p. 256 Bem's 4th Mounted Battery was so close to the Russian lines when they dismounted, that Bem had three Platoons use grenades and bullets and the last two used grapeshot. Silence prevailed until Bem ordered his cannons to fire at which time the entire Russian line of artillery responded.Leszczyński, p. 257 This lasted for about half an hour during which time Bem fired two hundred and fifty times. The effect of Bem's \\"terrible shots\\" was to cut out the ranks of grenadiers in the streets, and the impression on Diebitsch was enough that he withdrew most of his troops from the bank of the Narew under cover of darkness.Leszczyński, p. 258 However, between 20:00 and 22:00, Skrzynecki held a war council with his generals: Łubieński, Prądzyński, Skarżyński, Rybiński, Dembiński, Turno and Langermann in which they agreed to march towards Różan and then towards Warsaw, with Dembiński in command of the rearguard.Leszczyński, pp. 260 and 262 In popular culture The battle became one of the symbols of the failed uprising. Julius Mosen, a German poet and writer, commemorated the 4th Regiment in his poem Die letzten Zehn vom vierten Regiment (The last 10 of the 4th Regiment), later widely translated onto several languages. The battle also inspired Johan Sebastian Welhaven's Republikanerne. The Hungarian national poet Sándor Petőfi, who fought in the Hungarian War of Independence under the Polish general Józef Bem, against the Austrians and the Russians, in his poem Az erdélyi hadsereg (The Army of Transylvania) from 1849, praised Bem as the hero of the battle of Ostrołęka: \\"Why should we not win? We're led by Bem, The old champion of freedom!

This period started with the fall of the Visigothic kingdom after Tariq ibn-Ziyad's invasion of Iberia and the establishment of the Umayyad control in the territory. The present day Algarve derives its name from this Arabic name. The region had a population of about 500,000 people. Umayyad Conquest The Iberian Peninsula in 750. After a small civil war in the already Christianized Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania, King Roderic (Rodrigo in Portuguese and Spanish) had a strong position in the peninsula. His opponents, exiled in Ceuta, asked Musa ibn Nusair, Umayyad Muslim governor and general, for help. The initially skeptical general sent an experimental expedition mainly consisting of Moors from North and West Africa, led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, thus initiating the Muslim conquest of Iberia. Tariq utterly defeated Roderic's Visigothic army in the Battle of Guadalete, and soon after captured Toledo and Córdoba. With Tariq's success, Musa joined the expedition and established himself as governor of the new territories. By 714 Évora, Santarém and Coimbra had been conquered, and two years later Lisbon was in Muslim control. By 718 most of today's Portuguese territory was under Umayyad rule. The Umayyads eventually stopped between Poitiers and Tours but Muslim rule in Iberia would last until 1492 with the fall of the Kingdom of Granada. Emirate and the Caliphate The Caliphate of Córdoba in 1000. The Emirate of Córdoba lasted from 756 to 929. The Caliphate of Córdoba lasted from 929 to 1031. It was followed by the Taifas. First taifa period Taifas in 1031. The first Taifa of Badajoz, ruled by the Aftasid dynasty, existed from 1009 to 1094. The Taifa of Lisbon lasted from 1022 to 1034, when it as annexed to Taifa of Badajoz. Lisbon was ruled by Alfonso VI of León and Castile between 1093 and 1094. The first Taifa of Mértola lasted from 1033 to 1044, when it became part of the Taifa of Seville. The Taifa of Santa Maria do Algarve lasted from 1018 to 1051, when it became part of the Taifa of Seville. The first Taifa of Silves lasted from 1040 to 1063, when it became part of the Taifa of Seville. The Taifa of Santarém lasted from 1044 to 1045, when it became part of the Taifa of Badajoz. Almoravid dynasty Almoravid dynasty in 1120. The Almoravid dynasty lasted from 1040 to 1147. During some of that time it ruled over what is now Southern Portugal. After a successful siege, Portugal gained control of Lisbon in 1147. Second taifa period There were three taifas in what is now Portugal after the fall of the Almoravid dynasty: the second Taifa of Mértola, which lasted from 1144 to 1151, the second Taifa of Silves, which lasted from 1144 to 1151 and the Taifa of Tavira which lasted from 1146 to 1150. All three taifas became part of the Almohad Caliphate in 1151. Almohad Caliphate Almohad Caliphate in 1157. The Almohad Caliphate lasted from 1121 to 1269. During much of this time, until 1249, it ruled much of what is now southern Portugal. Eventually, however, a taifa based at Niebla was founded in the last years of 1230s and controlled the region up to 1249, when the Kingdom of Portugal conquered Faro.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Toronto Blue Jays, and is a four-time MLB All-Star. In 2007, Martin won the Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award. Martin became the everyday catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers immediately upon his MLB debut in 2006, and continued in that role for nearly five years. His offensive and defensive performance earned wide accolades during his first three years, but they diminished significantly in 2009 and 2010. Martin spent the last two months of 2010 on the disabled list. After the Dodgers declined to offer him arbitration in 2011, he signed with the Yankees and succeeded Jorge Posada as the Yankees' everyday catcher. In November 2012, Martin signed a two-year free agent contract with the Pirates, and took over the team's everyday catcher duties. Following the 2014 season, he signed a five-year, $82 million contract with the Blue Jays. In January 2019, he was traded back to the Dodgers. Professional career =Minor leagues= Martin was selected in the 35th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft by the Montreal Expos, but did not sign. He then attended Chipola College for two years before being chosen in the 17th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Los Angeles Dodgers. Drafted as a third baseman, Martin played his first professional season with the Gulf Coast Dodgers, and hit .286 with 10 RBI in 41 games. In the offseason, he was converted to a catcher. Martin played the 2003 minor league season with the Ogden Raptors, and was later promoted to the Class-A South Georgia Waves. In 77 combined games, he batted .276 with 9 home runs and 50 RBI. Martin was a Florida State League All-Star catcher while with the Vero Beach Dodgers in 2004, playing 122 games and batting .250 with 15 home runs and 64 RBI. During the offseason, Martin played with the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League. In 2005, he played in a career-high 129 games for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns and made the All-Star team, hitting .311 with 9 home runs and 61 RBI. Martin began the 2006 season with the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s, where he hit .297 in 23 games before his promotion. =Los Angeles Dodgers= Los Angeles Dodgers in 2008 Martin was promoted to the Dodgers on May 5, 2006, after a wrist injury to starting catcher Dioner Navarro. He got two hits, including a double, in the game. His first hit was against Chris Capuano. On May 7, he hit his first major league home run against Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Dave Bush. On June 6, 2006, Martin and Éric Gagné made baseball history by becoming the first French Canadian battery in the majors. Martin's play was good enough that, on June 26, 2006, Navarro was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 13, 2006, Martin hit his first career walk-off home run in a victory that completed a sweep of the rival San Francisco Giants. On September 18, 2006, Martin hit a solo home run off of Trevor Hoffman, the third of four consecutive home runs in the bottom of the 9th inning to tie the San Diego Padres. It was the first time four home runs had been hit in a row since the 1964 Minnesota Twins. On April 21, 2007, Martin hit a walk-off grand slam against Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Shawn Chacón in the bottom of the 10th inning. This was the first grand slam of his career. In May 2007, Martin broke the Dodgers' franchise record for single- season steals by a catcher (12) set by John Roseboro in 1962. On July 1 it was announced that Martin finished in first place in All-Star Game voting, leading Paul Lo Duca by 296,948 votes. He became the first ever Canadian born catcher to start the All-Star Game. At the end of the 2007 season, he was awarded with the National League Gold Glove Award and the Silver Slugger Award. On May 2, 2008, Martin started his first game at third base since reaching the Majors, allowing veteran backup Gary Bennett to spell Martin behind the plate. Martin made his second all-star game during the 2008 season. He caught 10 innings of a 15 inning game in which the American League won 4 to 3. Martin's 10 innings caught are tied for fourth place all time among all star catchers in a single game. On January 20, 2009, Martin signed a one-year, $3.9 million contract to avoid salary arbitration. The deal was the largest ever awarded to a catcher in his first year of arbitration.Source: Dodgers give Martin 1-year, $3.9M deal . Retrieved on January 20, 2009. He played for the Canadian team during the 2009 World Baseball Classic and then rejoined the Dodgers. He slumped offensively in 2009, hitting only .250 with 7 home runs in 143 games, the weakest totals in his four-year career. In 2010, Martin continued to regress as he hit .248 with 5 home runs and 26 RBI in 97 games. In August, Martin suffered a torn labrum in his right hip when he was trying to avoid a tag at home plate in a game against the Padres. The injury kept him sidelined for the rest of the season. Due to his uncertain recovery from injury and declining production, and concern that Martin would be awarded a salary as high as $6 million in arbitration, the Dodgers did not tender Martin a contract for 2011 and allowed him to become a free agent. The Dodgers offered Martin a one-year contract worth $4.2 million prior to the arbitration hearings but he insisted on receiving well above $5 million. After Martin rebuffed the Dodgers' offer, the Dodgers non-tendered him and signed journeyman catcher Rod Barajas, though hinting that Martin could still have a place on the team. Martin said the Dodgers had shown by avoiding arbitration that they no longer \\"believed in\\" him. =New York Yankees= New York Yankees in 2011 Martin agreed to a $6 million guaranteed one-year contract with the New York Yankees for the 2011 season. The value of the contract could reach $9.4 million if he caught 110 games. Martin began the 2011 season as the everyday catcher for the Yankees. He was elected to the 2011 American League All-Star team as a Yankee. Along with Robinson Canó and Curtis Granderson, Martin was one of the Yankees' three batters who hit an MLB record three grand slams in a single game in a 22–9 rout of the Oakland Athletics at Yankee Stadium on August 25, 2011. As a Super Two player, Martin was eligible for arbitration for a fourth time, and he signed a $7.5 million one-year contract for the 2012 season with up to $100,000 in performance bonuses with the Yankees to avoid arbitration on January 24. He spent the year as the starting catcher with Chris Stewart as his backup. In 133 games, he hit .211 with 21 HR and 53 RBI. Martin started all 9 games of the Yankees postseason, going 5-31 with 1 HR. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Martin with the Pittsburgh Pirates On November 29, 2012, Ken Rosenthal reported that the Pittsburgh Pirates had signed Martin for two years and $17 million. The deal became official on November 30. On June 4, 2013, Martin made his first start and appearance at right field. On June 8, 2013, Martin hit his 100th career home run. In the NL Wild Card Game on October 1, 2013, Martin hit a pair of solo home runs as the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati Reds 6-2. The first was an infamous home run off Reds starter Johnny Cueto. Cueto, having his name chanted by 40,000 Pirates fans, dropped the ball while on the mound. His next pitch, a fastball over the heart of the plate, was crushed into the left-field stands by Martin. This home run gave the Pirates the momentum to win the game, their first postseason victory in 21 years. During a game against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 20, 2014, Martin was involved in a brawl which was started when Carlos Gómez hit a triple off Gerrit Cole after which Martin was suspended 2 games by the MLB on April 22, 2014 for his role in the brawl. =Toronto Blue Jays= Toronto Blue Jays in 2015 On November 18, 2014, the Toronto Blue Jays announced that they had signed Martin to a five-year, $82 million contract. Early in spring training, manager John Gibbons told reporters that Martin would be R.A. Dickey's catcher during practice and in preseason games, to give him the opportunity to practice catching Dickey's knuckleball. Martin received a standing ovation from the fans at Olympic Stadium on April 3, as the Blue Jays played their final two spring training games in Montreal for the second consecutive year. On April 19, 2015, Martin caught Jeff Francis in his debut for the Blue Jays, and in doing so formed the first all-Canadian battery in franchise history. On June 2, Martin stole home off the back end of a double steal, and became the first Blue Jay to steal home since Brett Lawrie did so in 2012. Martin established a new career-high in home runs on September 26, hitting his 22nd of the season to aid the Blue Jays to a 10–8 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. He ended the 2015 regular season with a .240 batting average, 23 home runs, and 77 RBI in 129 games. He led the major leagues in passed balls, with 19.Major League Leaderboards » 2015 » All Positions » Fielding Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball Martin was announced as a finalist for the catcher Gold Glove award, along with Salvador Pérez and Jason Castro. Martin appeared in 137 games for the Blue Jays in 2016, and hit .231 with 20 home runs and 74 RBI. He struggled in the postseason, recording only three hits in 33 at-bats. On April 29, 2017, Martin became the 15th catcher to record 10,000 career putouts at the position. On June 20, 2018, Martin became the 11th catcher to make 11,000 career putouts at the position. Martin endured his worst offensive season of his career, hitting .194 with 10 home runs and 25 RBIs. In the final game of the 2018 season, Martin managed the Blue Jays, the team wound up losing in his managerial debut. =Return to the Dodgers= On January 11, 2019, the Blue Jays traded Martin to the Dodgers for prospects Ronny Brito and Andrew Sopko. The Blue Jays also sent $16.4 million to offset most of Martin's $20 million salary. Martin spent the 2019 season as the Dodgers backup catcher, first behind Austin Barnes and then Will Smith. On March 30, 2019, Martin pitched the top of the ninth inning against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He made ten pitches and retired three straight batters and became the first primary position player to do so since left fielder Willie Smith got the final out of a Detroit Tigers win over the Washington Senators on September 23, 1963. Martin was the first full-time position player to work a 1-2-3 ninth in a team win since at least 1925. On August 28, 2019, Martin became the first position player to pitch in a shutout victory since October 3, 1917 when George Kelly of the New York Giants did so. Martin played in 83 games for the Dodgers in 2019, hitting .220 with six homers and 20 RBI. Besides catcher, he also played in seven games at third base and pitched four scoreless innings in four relief appearances for the Dodgers during the season, allowing only two hits. International career Martin was first selected to play for Canada during the 2009 World Baseball Classic. That year, in an effort to quit the use of chewing tobacco, Martin began wearing a custom-fitted mouthpiece during the WBC and Spring training. Martin hoped to switch to shortstop during the 2013 World Baseball Classic, citing he did not want to learn another pitching staff during the tournament, because he was already learning a new staff in Pittsburgh. Martin played third base in the minors before converting to catcher. Martin would later withdraw his name, citing soreness. On December 5, 2016, Martin committed to play shortstop for Team Canada at the 2017 World Baseball Classic. However, Martin was left off Team Canada's WBC roster on February 8, 2017, due to insurance complications relating to his offseason minor knee surgery. Personal life Martin was born in Toronto, Ontario, and spent his early childhood in Montreal and Chelsea, Quebec. After he had become successful as a professional ballplayer, his childhood ballpark in Chelsea was refurbished and named after him. Along with playing baseball in the Montreal neighbourhood of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Martin played hockey for N.D.G. Minor Hockey. He graduated from Polyvalente Édouard-Montpetit High School. After graduating from high school, Martin took a junior college scholarship at Chipola College in Marianna, Florida, United States. Martin is biracial: his father, Russell Martin Sr., is Black Canadian, while his mother, Suzanne Jeanson, is Franco-Manitoban. His full name is Russell Nathan Coltrane Jeanson Martin Jr. He was named Russell for his father, Nathan for a great- grandfather, Jeanson after his mother's family, and Coltrane to pay homage to musician John Coltrane, whom his father admired. Martin's parents separated when Martin was two years old. His father used to play saxophone in Montreal metro stations to help pay for his son's baseball training. Martin Sr. played O Canada on his saxophone before a 2015 spring training game. When Martin was nine years old, his mother remarried. She moved to Paris, France with her new husband and daughter. Russell Jr. would split his time living between his mother in Paris and his father in Montreal for a year. Martin changed the name printed on his jersey to \\"J. Martin\\" for the 2009 season in reference to \\"Jeanson\\", in honour of his mother.

The Plan of Ayutla was the 1854 written plan aimed at removing conservative, centralist President Antonio López de Santa Anna from control of Mexico during the Second Federal Republic of Mexico period. Initially, it seemed little different than other political plans of the era, but it is considered to be the first act of the Liberal Reform in Mexico.Robert J. Knowlton, \\"Plan of Ayutla\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 4, p. 420. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. It was the catalyst for revolts in many parts of Mexico, which led to the resignation of Santa Anna from the presidency, never to vie for office again.Erika Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\" in Encyclopedia of Mexico, vol. 1, p. 119. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. The next Presidents of Mexico were the liberals, Juan Álvarez, Ignacio Comonfort, and Benito Juárez. The new regime would then proclaim the 1857 Mexican Constitution, which implemented a variety of liberal reforms. Dissent against the Santa Anna dictatorship After Mexico's defeat in the Mexican–American War, the country was beset by despair and political chaos. Abhorring long-term exploitation and short-term heavy taxes needed to finance the war, some indigenous peoples revolted in the Sierra Gorda region (1847–1849) and in the Yucatán peninsula (1847–1852).Mark Wasserman, (2000). Everyday Life and Politics in Nineteenth Century Mexico: Men, Women, and War. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico. p. 101. . The north of Mexico was especially devastated. The territorial losses to the United States codified in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was an impetus for Apache and Comanche raids in northern Mexico. The region was further weakened by depopulation, with the discovery of gold in the recently lost territory of California prompted inhabitants of northern Mexico to migrate there.Wasserman, (2000). Everyday Life and Politics in Nineteenth Century Mexico, p. 110. During this chaos, José María Tornel and Juan Suárez y Navarro founded the Santanista party. The Santanistas believed that Mexico should be ruled by a strong dictator who would create a centralized state that would emphasize the importance of the Catholic faith. Conservative politician and historian Lucas Alamán stated that the Church was \\"the only tie left that unites the Mexican people.\\"Will Fowler, (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 292. . The Santanistas hoped that exiled President Santa Anna would be that strong dictator. The Santanistas, with help from the radical puros and the military, overthrew the moderado Mariano Arista.Fowler, (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico, pp. 295–296. Santa Anna arrived in Veracruz on 1 April 1853, and he took office upon reaching Mexico City on 20 April.Richard A. Johnson, (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 14. . Upon taking office yet again, Santa Anna took measures to improve the army, hoping to create a standing army of 90,000 men.Johnson, The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855. p. 17. However, due to the unpopularity of the draft and the low quality of the troops who were recruited, Santa Anna lowered his goal to 46,000 troops.Johnson, The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855, pp. 21-22. Mexican Liberals whom Santa Anna considered threats, notably Benito Juárez and Melchor Ocampo, were forced into exile to the U.S. Juárez and Ocampo settled in New Orleans and plotted to overthrow the government.Roeder,(1947). Juarez and his Mexico, pp. 103–105. Santa Anna also introduced tax increases to boost revenue. On 14 May 1853, a decree was promulgated that renewed all taxes and added new ones, such as the restoration of the alcabala (sales tax) and the abolition of financial concessions to the port of Acapulco and to Yucatán.Johnson,(1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855 p. 23. Santa Anna had some successful policies, such as measures that reduced banditry and improved the country's highway system.Johnson (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855, p. 25. However, he became increasingly authoritarian as well as pompous, adopting the title of \\"Most Serene Highness.\\"Johnson. The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855, p. 20. His popularity also declined due to the tax increases that he implemented, his suppression of political opposition, and his regime's rampant corruption.Fowler, Will (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico, p. 311. A key event that further decreased his popularity was the Gadsden Purchase, in which the United States paid $10,000,000 to Mexico in exchange for more Mexican land. It has been speculated that Santa Anna took $600,000 of the indemnity for himself. Santa Anna was further weakened by the deaths of many advisors and the alienation of others, as exemplified by his decision to exile Suárez y Navarro.Fowler,(2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. pp. 308–309. Plan of Ayutla is drafted By the beginning of 1854, Santa Anna had secured control over most of Mexico. The southern state of Guerrero, which was ruled by General Juan Álvarez, remained outside of his control. Due to its difficult terrain, the province was naturally shielded from the capital. Álvarez was angered by Santa Anna's pro-Spanish policies, such as hiring Spanish mercenaries, and by the central government's confiscation of Guerrero's public lands. The government also planned to build a highway from Mexico City to Acapulco, which threatened Álvarez's regional autonomy.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 38–39. . Angered by Álvarez's disloyal behavior, Santa Anna sent General Pérez Palacios to seize Acapulco, and Álvarez similarly prepared for war.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 41–42. . Colonel Ignacio Comonfort, one of Álvarez's subordinates, pressed for a plan to be written, as he wanted to win over public opinion and to add an idealistic angle to the planned rebellion.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 43. . He wanted the document to be vague and to avoid any topics that would narrow the movement's appeal.Roeder, Ralph (1947). Juarez and his Mexico. New York: Viking Press. pp. 118. Initially drafted on 24 February 1854, by Colonel Florencio Villarreal, it was proclaimed on 1 March 1854, in Ayutla, Guerrero. The Plan de Ayutla was influenced by a document written by the New Orleans exiles.Roeder, Ralph (1947). Juarez and his Mexico. New York: Viking Press. pp. 109. The Ayutla Plan not only aimed at removing the dictator but also convening a constituent assembly in order to draft a federal constitution.\\"Memoria Política de México\\". www.memoriapoliticademexico.org. Retrieved 2017-04-23. The Plan charged Santa Anna with being a tyrant and declared the Gadsden Purchase to be illegal. The authors promised to end the draft and the poll tax. Álvarez, Tomás Moreno, and Nicolás Bravo were declared to be the military leaders of the insurgency, and they were given the power to alter the plan if necessary. Álvarez and Comonfort did not support this proclamation publicly, as Comonfort believed that it would not gain support among moderados. The Plan was then slightly revised and accepted by the rebel leaders on 13 March.Johnson, Richard A. (1974).

Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press 1957, pp. 3–4. as well as Ignacio Comonfort, Miguel Lerdo de Tejada, Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada, and José María Jesús Carbajal. Revolution of Ayutla Álvarez's forces initiated 19 months of guerrilla warfare and civil unrest against Santa Anna. The rebels were aided by the exiles in New Orleans, who sent them weapons.Meyer, Michael C.; Sherman, William L. (1983). The Course of Mexican History: Second Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 376. . This uprising is termed the Revolution of Ayutla (1854−1855), since it entailed not just a narrow political goal of ousting the dictator, but a more thorough change in political direction via armed warfare. The Revolution of Ayutla brought a new generation of younger men into active national political life, a \\"generation of giants\\" including military men: Comonfort, Santiago Vidaurri, Epitacio Huerta, and Manuel García Pueblita; as well as radical liberal intellectuals, Ocampo, Arriaga, Guillermo Prieto, and Juárez.Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\", p. 119. In the summer of 1855, Juárez returned to Acapulco from exile to serve as a political ally of Álvarez.Meyer, Michael C.; Sherman, William L. (1983). The Course of Mexican History: Second Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 376. . Alvarez had success in mobilizing forces in Guerrero, many of which had formed paramilitary units during the U.S. - Mexican War (1846-1848), Santa Anna decided to crush the rebellion in person, leaving Mexico City with an army on 16 March 1854.Fowler, Will (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 311. . Santa Anna's federal army defeated the \\"Liberating Army\\" at El Coquillo.Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\", p. 120. He then arrived at Acapulco on 19 April, but the rebels cut his communications with Mexico City, and he learned that Comonfort had fortified the city. After a week long siege, Santa Anna was forced to retreat. On 30 April, Santa Anna defeated Moreno at el Pelegrino, but the rebels inflicted severe losses on Santa Anna's army, and Santa Anna himself was almost captured. During the retreat to Mexico City, Santa Anna's army executed rebel prisoners and burned villages.Fowler, Will (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 313. . There followed uprisings in the states of Michoacán, Morelos, Oaxaca, and Mexico state. The rebellion then spread to the northern states of Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, and Nuevo León. The irregular forces of the liberal side took a few months' time off from the revolution to attend to their crops.Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\", p. 120. The war continued without major battles or decisive victories. The government's most significant success was Colonel Félix Zuloaga's victory at El Limón on 22 July.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854–1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 51-52. . However, the rebellion proved impossible to suppress and, on 18 January 1855, Zuloaga surrendered after being besieged at Tecpan.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854-1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 55. . By April, the rebels were making progress in most parts of Mexico, but especially in Michoacán, which prompted Santa Anna to lead one last offensive into that province on 30 April 1855.Johnson, Richard A. (1974). The Mexican Revolution of Ayutla, 1854-1855: An Analysis of the Evolution and Destruction of Santa Anna’s Last Dictatorship. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press. p. 58. . The rebels retreated instead of engaging Santa Anna's army, and, unable to crush them, he eventually returned to Mexico City.Fowler, Will (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 292. . When Mexico City denounced Santa Anna, he abdicated on 12 August 1855 and fled into exile. Álvarez's forces marched into the capital with a \\"brigade of rustics called Pintos (ferocious warriors so called because in earlier times, they wore face paint).Paul Vanderwood, \\"Betterment for Whom? The Reform Period: 1855-1875\\" in The Oxford History of Mexico, Michael C. Meyer and William H. Beezley, eds. New York: Oxford University Press 2000, p.372. In the capital there was widespread popular support for the Revolution of Ayutla, with people gathering in the Alameda Park and waiting hours to sign a document in support of Mexico City for the revolution.Pani, \\"Revolution of Ayutla\\", p. 120. Álvarez then assumed the office of President of Mexico. Once the rebels occupied Mexico City, they confiscated all of Santa Anna's property so as to recoup the indemnity from the Gadsden Purchase that Santa Anna's regime had squandered.Fowler, Will (2007). Santa Anna of Mexico. Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. p. 315. . Aftermath The Plan paved the way for La Reforma (the Liberal Reform). The Revolution of Ayutla brought its liberals to power. Their leaders initially passed a series of reform laws, notably the Ley Juárez, the Ley Lerdo, and the Ley Iglesias. These laws were explicitly anticlerical. The Ley Juárez abolished special courts for groups such as the military and the clergy. The Ley Lerdo sought to replace communal ownership of land with individual ownership of land, and it confiscated Church lands. The Ley Iglesias sought to control the costs of Church administered sacraments.Wasserman, Mark (2000). Everyday Life and Politics in Nineteenth Century Mexico: Men, Women, and War. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico. p. 103-104. Soon afterward, Comonfort, who had succeeded Álvarez as President, convened a Congress to draft a new Constitution.Roeder, Ralph (1947). Juarez and his Mexico. New York: Viking Press. pp. 125. The most contentious topic was the possibility of including a provision that would guarantee religious toleration, with puros supporting such a measure and moderados opposing it. The moderados opposed the measure with arguments attacking Protestantism and arguments that religious toleration would harm the family and national cohesion.Meyer, Michael C.; Sherman, William L. (1983). The Course of Mexican History: Second Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 380. . Other moderados argued that Constitutions should avoid idealism and reflect the country's populace.Roeder, Ralph (1947). Juarez and his Mexico. New York: Viking Press. pp. 133. Eventually, the moderados would prevent the inclusion of a religious toleration provision, and they would also prevent a trial by jury provision from being included in the Constitution.Wasserman, Mark (2000). Everyday Life and Politics in Nineteenth Century Mexico: Men, Women, and War. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico. p. 104. . However, the Ley Juárez, the Ley Lerdo, and the Ley Iglesias were incorporated into the 1857 Mexican Constitution. The Congress also added many other liberal stipulations, such as freedom of thought, freedom of the press, freedom of petition, and numerous laws defending the rights of those being prosecuted, such as the right to appeal, the right of a defendant to access material so as to craft a defense, and the abolition of double jeopardy.Roeder, Ralph (1947). Juarez and his Mexico. New York: Viking Press. pp. 138-139. The new Constitution also reaffirmed the abolition of slavery, which had been in effect since 1829.Wasserman, Mark (2000). Everyday Life and Politics in Nineteenth Century Mexico: Men, Women, and War. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico. p. 104. . Objecting to the new Constitution's anticlerical elements, Pope Pius IX opposed it.Meyer, Michael C.; Sherman, William L. (1983). The Course of Mexican History: Second Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press. p. 381. . Domestic Conservatives and the Mexican Catholic Church also opposed La Reforma and the 1857 Constitution in the Plan of Tacubaya. This would soon prompt an open civil war, known as the War of the Reform or Three Years War (1858−1860).

The armoured car regiment had around 50 BA armoured cars and 12 ( 18? ) Leichter Panzerspähwagen (Sd Kfz 221) armoured cars. Besides, it had more than 400 Ford trucks. The motorised infantry regiment used Soviet trucks and rifles, and the artillery regiment had 12 122 mm howitzers, also 45 mm anti-aircraft artillery and 75 mm field guns. Following the Divisions combats in May in the Battle of Lanfeng and in operations afterward until September 1938, the division's original subordinate mechanized units were placed under direct command of the 5th Army, and the division was reorganized as a motorised infantry division of about 9000 men due to the June 1938 reorganization of Divisions.

He played for 17 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball from 1945 to 1961, most notably for the St. Louis Cardinals. Although Rice was a relatively weak hitter, he sustained a lengthy career in the major leagues due to his valuable defensive abilities. Career A native of Portsmouth, Ohio, Rice attended Portsmouth High School where he starred in football, basketball and track as well as baseball. He was contracted as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals in 1941. Although Rice received his induction notice into the military in 1943, he was turned down because of a physical disqualification. After playing in the minor leagues for four seasons, he made his major league debut with the Cardinals on 2 May, 1945 at the age of 22. Shortly after the season began, the Cardinals sold the contract for their star catcher, Walker Cooper to the New York Giants, leaving Rice to share catching duties with Ken O'Dea. Although they competed for the same job, the veteran O'Dea, who had played with Hall of Fame catcher Gabby Hartnett in Chicago during the 1930s, provided Rice with valuable help in learning the intricacies of catching in the major leagues. Rice posted a .261 batting average in 83 games as the Cardinals finished in second place, three games behind the Chicago Cubs. Although he served as a backup catcher to Joe Garagiola in 1946, he regularly played whenever Harry Brecheen pitched. The Cardinals ended the season tied for first place with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the two teams met in the 1946 National League tie-breaker series. It was the first playoff tiebreaker in Major League Baseball history. The Cardinals won the first two games of the best-of-three game series to capture the National League pennant. In the 1946 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Rice caught all three of Brecheen's victories, as the Cardinals defeated the Red Sox in seven games. He was also the hitting standout in Game 2, with a single, a double and a walk, scoring two runs in the Cardinals' 3-0 victory. In 1947, Rice caught the majority of the team's games and guided the Cardinals' pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average and the most strikeouts in the National League, as the Cardinals finished in second place to the Dodgers. His pitch-calling skills were made evident once again in 1949, leading the Cardinals' pitching staff to the lowest team earned run average in the league, as the Cardinals once again finished in second place, one game behind the Dodgers. Rice as a coach for the Los Angeles Angels, circa 1965. Rice had his best season in 1952, posting a .259 batting average along with 11 home runs and a career-high 65 runs batted in. He also led National League catchers in games played, putouts, assists and in baserunners caught stealing. The following season, Rice was named as a reserve player for the National League team in the 1953 All-Star Game, although an injury kept him from participating in the game. Rice was injured during a game against the Dodgers on 7 June, 1954 when Roy Campanella stole home and spiked Rice's leg. While he was sidelined with the injury, his replacement, Bill Sarni hit for a .300 average for the remainder of the season. In the middle of the 1955 season, the 32-year-old Rice was traded to the Milwaukee Braves, who were in need of a backup catcher for their perennial All-Star, Del Crandall. He became pitcher Bob Buhl's personal catcher, as Buhl did not like having Crandall calling his pitches. In 1956, Rice helped Buhl to an 18-8 record as the Braves held first place with two games left in the season before the team faltered and finished the season one game behind the Dodgers. In the 1957 season, Buhl again won 18 games and posted a 2.74 earned run average with Rice as his catcher, as the Braves won the National League pennant. Rice became a member of his second world championship winning team when the Braves defeated the New York Yankees in the 1957 World Series. The Braves won the National League pennant for a second consecutive year in 1958, but lost a rematch with the Yankees in the 1958 World Series. In June 1959, Rice suffered a broken leg in a collision at home plate with Willie Mays. He missed more than two months of the season and was used sparingly upon his return. He played in only a handful of games before he was given a coaching position in late August to make room on the roster for another player. The Braves then released him at the end of the season. Rice played for the Chicago Cubs in 1960, but was released in June when the Cubs acquired catcher Jim Hegan. One of the 18 games Rice caught as a Cub was Don Cardwell's no-hitter on 15 May. He was then re-signed with the Cardinals, but only appeared in one game before being selected off waivers by the Baltimore Orioles in September. After appearing in only one game for the Orioles, he was released in October. Rice became the first player ever to sign with the Los Angeles Angels expansion team.The Baseball Guide, 1972 edition. St. Louis: The Sporting News, p. 313 He played in 30 games during their inaugural 1961 campaign and was released as a player at the end of the season, but was retained within the organization. He played in his final major league game on 31 August 1961 at the age of 39. Career statistics In a seventeen-year major league career, Rice played in 1,309 games, accumulating 908 hits in 3,826 at bats for a .237 career batting average along with 79 home runs, 441 runs batted in and an on- base percentage of .312. He ended his career with a .987 fielding percentage. Rice was known for his strong defensive skills, leading National League catchers in fielding percentage in 1948 and 1949, and tying for the lead in double plays in 1949, 1950 and 1951. Rice also had a career in the National Basketball League, playing four seasons for the Rochester Royals from 1946 until 1950, when Fred Saigh, the Cardinals owner, asked him to concentrate on baseball. Coaching and managing career Rice was a longtime member of the Angels' organization. After retiring as a player, he was retained as their first base coach from 1962 to 1966. He spent the 1967 season as a coach for the Cleveland Indians, but then returned to the Angels as a minor league manager and had success at the Triple-A level. He was named Minor League Manager of the Year for 1971 by The Sporting News after leading the Salt Lake City Bees to a divisional title in the Pacific Coast League. Rice was rewarded with a promotion to manager of the 1972 Angels, but after one season and a 75–80 (.484) fifth-place finish, he was replaced by Bobby Winkles. He remained with the club, however, as a scout. Rice died of complications from cancer while attending a benefit dinner in his honor of in Garden Grove, California, on 26 January 1983 at the age of 60.

The Battle of Gujrat was a decisive battle in the Second Anglo-Sikh War, fought on 21 February 1849, between the forces of the East India Company, and a Sikh army in rebellion against the Company's control of the Sikh Empire, represented by the child Maharaja Duleep Singh who was in British custody in Lahore. The Sikh army was defeated by the British regular and Bengal Army forces of the British East India Company. After it capitulated a few days later, the Punjab was annexed to the East India Company's territories and Duleep Singh was deposed. Outbreak and course of the war After the British victory in the First Anglo-Sikh War, the Punjab was indirectly governed by a British representative at the Durbar (court) in Lahore and Agents in several of the regions. The Sikh Army, the Khalsa, was kept in being and used to keep order in the Punjab and North West Frontier Region. The Khalsa regarded itself as betrayed rather than defeated in the first war, and several of its Sardars (Generals) plotted rebellion. However, the first outbreak came at Multan on 18 April 1848, where rebellious troops murdered a British agent, Lieutenant Patrick Vans Agnew, and expelled a Sirdar imposed as ruler by the British Resident at Lahore. The former ruler, Dewan Mulraj, resumed his authority and prepared for a siege. Rather than use large forces from the British and Bengal Armies during the hot weather and monsoon seasons, the Governor General of Bengal, Lord Dalhousie, deployed part of the Khalsa and other irregular contingents against Mulraj. On 14 September, the troops from the Khalsa besieging Multan under Sardar Sher Singh Attariwalla also rebelled. They did not join Mulraj however, but moved north along the Chenab River into the main Sikh-populated area of the Punjab to gather recruits and obtain supplies. Late in 1848, a large British and Bengal army took the field during the cold weather season under the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, General Sir Hugh Gough. Gough already had a reputation, whether deserved or not, for unimaginative head-on tactics. On 22 November at Ramnagar, his cavalry were repulsed attacking a Sikh bridgehead on the east bank of the Chenab. Then on 13 January 1849, he launched a hasty frontal attack against Sher Singh's army at Chillianwala near the Jhelum River and was driven back with heavy casualties. Several days' heavy rain followed, preventing either army from renewing the battle. After they had faced each other for three days, both withdrew. Prelude to the Battle The Battle of Goojerat, on 21 February 1849, hand-coloured aquatint by J. Harris after Marten, image ., R. Ackermann, 1850 Rather than launch a counter-attack against Gough, Sher Singh's aim was to join forces with the troops under his father, Sardar Chattar Singh Attariwalla. Chattar Singh's army had been confined to the Hazara region for several months by Muslim irregulars under British officers. At the start of 1849, Amir Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan had sided with the rebellious Sikhs. His aim was to recover the area around Peshawar, which had been conquered by Ranjit Singh early in the nineteenth century, but his support was half-hearted. Nevertheless, when 3,500 Afghan horsemen approached the vital fort of Attock on the Indus River, its garrison of Muslim troops defected. This allowed Chattar Singh to move out of Hazara and link up with Sher Singh near Rawalpindi. On the British side, once news of Chillianwala reached Britain, Gough was almost immediately superseded. His replacement was General Charles James Napier, who would require several weeks to travel from England. In the meantime, the Siege of Multan had resumed, and Mulraj was forced to surrender on 22 January. This allowed the bulk of the besieging force to reinforce Gough's army. In particular, they brought large numbers of heavy guns with them. Gough, who had now received word of his dismissal but who remained in command until formally relieved, advanced against the Sikh army. He had three infantry divisions and a large cavalry force, with 100 guns of various weights and calibres. In spite of his successes, Sher Singh, who commanded the combined Sikh forces, was running out of strategic options. His large army was unable to find enough food. Any move north or west to obtain supplies would involve abandoning the main Sikh- populated area of the Punjab and moving into potentially hostile Muslim areas. He therefore attempted a bold outflanking move against Gough. His army moved east, intending to cross the Chenab and then move south before crossing the river again to attack Gough from the rear. When they reached the river, they found it swollen by heavy rains, and the few fords were defended by irregular Muslim cavalry under British officers, later reinforced by some of the troops marching up from Multan. Battle Map of the battle Sher Singh withdrew to Gujrat, where his army hastily prepared a defensive position. The Sikhs constructed a double entrenchment, which was also protected by a ravine. Most of the artillery was grouped in a central battery, screened by hastily planted bushes. The cavalry was deployed on the flanks. Several small villages in advance of the central battery were occupied by infantry, and the houses and buildings were prepared with \\"loopholes\\" for defence.Hernon, p.601 Although the position was strong, it was exposed to British artillery fire, and the hastily erected screen of brush was not as effective as the belts of scrub and jungle which had hidden the Sikh artillery from view at Chillianwala. Early on 21 February, Gough advanced against this position. When the Sikh artillery opened fire and disclosed their position, Gough deployed his large numbers of heavy guns against them. In a three-hour artillery duel, the Sikhs were forced to abandon their guns. Sikh and Indian sources were later to refer to the battle as the \\"Battle of the Guns\\". Once the Sikh artillery was largely silenced, the British infantry advanced. There was desperate hand-to-hand fighting for the small fortified villages of Burra Kalra and Chota Kalra.Hernon, p.602 However, the British guns were being advanced in successive \\"bounds\\", and the Sikhs broke. Gough reported after the battle: > The heavy artillery continued to advance with extraordinary celerity, taking > up successive forward positions, driving the enemy from those [positions] > they had retired to, whilst the rapid advance and beautiful fire of the > Horse Artillery and light field-batteries ... broke the ranks of the enemy > at all points. The whole infantry line now rapidly advanced and drove the > enemy before it; the nulla [ravine] was cleared, several villages stormed, > the guns that were in position carried, the camp captured and the enemy > routed in every directionHernon, pp.602-603 The Bengal Horse Artillery and British and Indian cavalry took up a ruthless and merciless pursuit, which turned the Sikh retreat into a rout over . Aftermath The next day, a division under Major General Sir Walter Gilbert took up the pursuit. The remnants of Sher Singh's forces retreated across the Jhelum and into progressively rougher country for eleven days, but Sher Singh was finally forced to agree to British terms for surrender. His army, reduced to 20,000 men (mainly irregular cavalry) and 10 guns, handed over its arms at a two-day ceremony on 12 March and disbanded. The small Afghan contingent also hastily retreated, destroying the pontoon bridge at Attock behind them. Dost Mohammed later concluded a peace with the East India Company, acknowledging their possession of the Peshawar region. The Punjab was formally annexed to British territory at Lahore on 2 April. At the end of his career, Gough had finally fought a model battle, using his vast superiority in heavy guns to drive Sher Singh's troops from their position without resorting to the bayonet as he usually did, and turning their retreat into a rout with his cavalry and horse artillery. He had also been able to operate for the first time without receiving contradictory instructions from Dalhousie. Throughout the war, Dalhousie had alternately goaded on and restrained Gough, usually at the most inconvenient moments. After the British had withdrawn at Chillianwala, Sikh and other irregulars showed no mercy to abandoned British combatant wounded and the British at Gujrat showed no mercy to surrendered or fleeing enemies.

It was the successor of the sallet. Characteristics Intermediate helmet (\\"close burgonet\\") with the peak, crest and falling buffe of the burgonet, combined with the hinged bevor of a close helmet. The burgonet helmet is characterised by a skull with a large fixed or hinged peak projecting above the face-opening, and usually an integral, keel-like, crest or comb running from front to rear. Attached to the skull are substantial hinged cheekpieces which usually do not meet at the chin or throat. A flange projects from the lower parts of the skull and cheekpieces to protect the back and sides of the neck. Though typically a relatively light helmet and open faced, a falling buffe, a sort of visor that was closed by being drawn up rather than down, was sometimes used. Some helmets, often termed \\"close burgonets\\", were made which took elements, such as the peak, crest and falling buffe, of the burgonet and combined them with the hinged bevor of the close helmet.Oakeshott, pp. 214-217Gravett, pp. 18 and 32 Illustrations of assorted styles of burgonets can be found in Claude Blair's European Armour: circa 1066 to circa 1700. (They are figures 135-141.) Use Commonplace throughout Europe, it first came into use early in the 16th century and had attained its classic form by c. 1550.Oakeshott, p. 214 Accompanied by plate armour, burgonets were mostly worn by cavalry: cuirassiers, demi-lancers and hussars (Polish hussars). German burgonet, c. 1560, showing the open face of the helmet. Parade burgonet of Henry II of France, 16th century, Army Museum (Paris). The Border Reivers, of the English-Scottish borderlands, were very fond of burgonets and the morion in Elizabethan times, and as a result reivers were often called steil (steel) bonnets.George MacDonald Fraser, The Steel Bonnets (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1972), 86.Keith Durham, The Border Reivers (Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 1995), 46. Burgonets were also a popular helmet type among the Polish winged hussars, where they merged with types of lobster- tailed pot helmets (Zischägge), often featuring a nasal bar or facial guard. The burgonet was common among the mercenary Swiss infantry who were pikemen who could defend themselves against cavalry (perhaps taking helmets of this form as trophies). Following the appearance of the Adrian and Brodie helmets and the Stahlhelm, in the First World War, the Swiss experimented with a \\"streamlined\\" form of the burgonet for their own national helmet, but both designs were rejected. The factors of utility of the burgonet over older helmets include: *Cost—The main factor in the decision to wear one; burgonets were significantly cheaper than closed-face helmets due to having fewer hinges and locking mechanisms required to keep typical close helms closed. *Encumbrance—Close helmets were slightly heavier, and while mobility was roughly similar, it could be hard for the wearer to see, and breathe freely during combat while wearing one. The burgonet, however, was light and had an open face that gave an advantage in close quarters combat. *Protection—The burgonet was not as protective as heavier helms, but still protected most of the head. Having an open face could be remedied with a falling buffe. An ornate parade burgonet, workshop of Filippo Negroli, 1543, Metropolitan Museum of Art Philippine Moros (c. 18th/19th century).

It is a software distribution or firmware that implements a computer appliance.SAN Data Center - Network World Virtual appliances are a subset of software appliances. The main distinction is the packaging format and the specificity of the target platform. A virtual appliance is a virtual machine image designed to run on a specific virtualization platform, while a software appliance is often packaged in more generally applicable image format (e.g., Live CD) that supports installations to physical machines and multiple types of virtual machines.Wu C F, Wang Y S, Liu G N, Amies, A, 2012, Create solutions on IBM SmartCloud Enterprise: Transfer image assets between different accounts IBM developerWorks, June 6. Installing a software appliance to a virtual machine and packaging that into an image, creates a virtual appliance. Benefits Software appliances have several benefits over traditional software applications that are installed on top of an operating system: * Simplified deployment: A software appliance encapsulates an application's dependencies in a pre-integrated, self-contained unit. This can dramatically simplify software deployment by freeing users from having to worry about resolving potentially complex OS compatibility issues, library dependencies or undesirable interactions with other applications. This is known as a \\"toaster.\\" * Improved isolation: software appliances are typically used to run applications in isolation from one another. If the security of an appliance is compromised, or if the appliance crashes, other isolated appliances will not be affected. * Improved performance: A software appliance does not embed any unused operating system services, applications or any form of bloatware hence it does not have to share the hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage space, ...) usually consumed by these on a generic OS setup. This naturally leads to faster boot time and application execution speed. In the case where multiple software appliances share and run simultaneously on the same hardware (on a virtualization platform for example) this will not hold true as running \`n\` instances of a software appliance (OS + software application) will consume more hardware resources than running \`n\` instances of a software application on \`1\` instance of an operating system due to the overhead of running \`n - 1\` more instances of operating system. Types of software appliances = Virtual appliance = A software appliance can be packaged in a virtual machine format as a virtual appliance, allowing it to be run within a virtual machine container. A virtual appliance could be built using either a standard virtual machine format such as Open Virtualization Format (OVF), or a format specific to a particular virtual machine container (for example, VMware, VirtualBox, or Amazon EC2). =Live CD appliance= A software appliance can be packaged as a Live CD image, allowing it to run on real hardware in addition to most types of virtual machines. This allows developers to avoid the complexities involved in supporting multiple incompatible virtual machine image formats and focus on the lowest common denominator instead (i.e., ISO images are supported by most Virtual Machine platforms). Commercial software appliances Commercial software appliances are typically sold as a subscription service (pay-as-you-go) and are an alternative approach to software as a service. Customers can receive all service and maintenance from the application vendor, eliminating the requirement to manage multiple maintenance streams, licenses, and service contracts. In some cases, the application vendor may install the software appliance on a piece of hardware prior to delivery to the customer, thereby creating a computer appliance. In both cases, the primary value to the customer remains the simplicity of purchase, deployment, and maintenance.

History In 2011, Toronto Rehab opened The iDAPT Centre Rehabilitation Research, where technologies and treatments to enhance the lives of people who are aging, ill or injured are tested in simulated environments. On July 1, 2011, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute became a part of the University Health Network. By a Special Act of Legislation, on November 2, 1998, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute was created with the amalgamation of three hospitals. These were: * Rehabilitation Institute of Toronto * Lyndhurst Spinal Cord Centre * Toronto Rehabilitation Centre Lyndhurst Spinal Cord Centre was established in 1945 as Lyndhurst Lodge to deal with returning Canadian veterans with spinal injuries from World War II. The institution was named after the street of first site on Lyndhurst Avenue in Toronto and led by Albin T. Jousse. In 1950 it was acquired by the Canadian Paraplegic Association and by 1974 it moved to the current and larger location, the former site of Mount Sinai Hospital when Mount Sinai moved to a new facility next door. In 1998 it merged with several other rehabilitation institutions to form TRI. Rehabilitation Institute of Toronto was formed in 1997 with the merger of two other hospitals, Queen Elizabeth and Hillcrest Hospitals. Queen Elizabeth Hospital was established in 1874 as a chronic care and long term health care facility. In the 1930s services added included physiotherapy and occupational therapy. By the 1970s it became a dedicated rehabilitation institution. Hillcrest Hospital opened in 1886 as long-term care and evolved into a rehab institution the 1970s. It specializes in care for stroke, cardiac and amputees patients needing rehabilitation needs. Toronto Rehabilitation Centre was created in 1922 to deal with long term health care needs of Canadian veterans of World War I.

Some members include Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, Iguanodon, Tenontosaurus, and the hadrosaurids or \\"duck-billed dinosaurs\\". Iguanodontians were one of the first groups of dinosaurs to be found. They are among the best known of the dinosaurs, and were among the most diverse and widespread herbivorous dinosaur groups of the Cretaceous period. Classification Skeletal mount of Dryosaurus at the Beneski Museum of Natural History Skeletal mount of Camptosaurus at the Museum of Western Colorado's Dinosaur Journey Museum Iguanodontia is often listed as an infraorder within a suborder Ornithopoda, though Benton (2004) lists Ornithopoda as an infraorder and does not rank Iguanodontia. Traditionally, iguanodontians were grouped into the superfamily Iguanodontoidea and family Iguanodontidae. However, phylogenetic studies show that the traditional \\"iguanodontids\\" are a paraphyletic grade leading up to the hadrosaurs (duck- billed dinosaurs). Groups like Iguanodontoidea are sometimes still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional \\"iguanodontids\\" are now included in the more inclusive group Hadrosauroidea. Iguanodontia was originally phylogenetically defined, by Paul Sereno, in 1998, as the most inclusive group containing Parasaurolophus walkeri but not Hypsilophodon foxii. Later, in 2005, he amended the definition to include Thescelosaurus neglectus as a secondary external specifier, alongside Hypsilophodon, accounting for the paraphyletic nature of Hypsilophodontidae. A 2017 study which named and described Burianosaurus noted that the type species Iguanodon bernissartensis must be part of the definition, and that the 2005 definition would, in their analysis, include a far larger group than intended (including Marginocephalia). They proposed an entirely new, node-based definition: the last common ancestor of Iguanodon bernissartensis, Dryosaurus altus, Rhabdodon priscus, and Tenontosaurus tilletti.

The highway travels from its southern terminus at SR 48 at the Alabama state line, north-northwest of Ephesus, to its northern terminus at SR 60 and SR 68 at the Tennessee state line on the McCaysville–Copperhill line, bisecting the northwestern portion of the state. Route description Douglas County SR 5 starts at the Alabama state line just east of Graham and north-northwest of Ephesus, in Carroll County, where the highway continues west into Randolph County, Alabama as SR 48\\\\. In Carroll County, the highway initially travels northeast, but soon turns to the east, and bisects the southern portion of rural Carroll County. SR 5 crosses U.S. Route 27/SR 1 (US 27/SR 1) in Roopville, and continues east until it nears the Chattahoochee River, where it turns northeast to parallel the river, and travels through Whitesburg. SR 5 continues northeast, then cuts north into Douglas County, where it is locally known as Bill Arp Road, crosses Interstate 20 (I-20) in Douglasville. Continuing northeast, and having picked up a concurrency with US 78/SR 8, the highway heads through Lithia Springs, crosses US 278/SR 6, and enters Cobb County and Austell. In Austell, SR 5 splits from US 78/SR 8 and heads slightly northeast through the western parts of Smyrna to just west of Dobbins Air Reserve Base. Traveling concurrently with SR 280, the highways wind to the north around Dobbins as South Cobb Drive, and SR 5 splits off and travels to the north by itself into Marietta as Atlanta Road. The highway then makes a sharp turn to the west and travels concurrently with SR 120 Loop, and both turn north again to just avoid the Marietta Square to its west. Curving to the northeast past the square, SR 5 leaves its concurrency with SR 120 Loop behind and heads north yet again, first as Cherokee Street, then Church Street, and curves to the northeast as it crosses US 41/SR 3\\\\. Soon thereafter, SR 5 merges with I-75 for a very short distance, and then splits off I-75 north of Marietta, together with its concurrency with I-575, and heads north and northeast into Cherokee County in the direction of Woodstock. From Marietta to Blue Ridge, the route parallels the Marietta and North Georgia Rail Line. SR 5 remains concurrent with I-575 for that route's entire length, as the two highways bisect Cherokee County, and bypass Holly Springs, Canton (crossing the Etowah River north of Canton), and Ball Ground. North of Ball Ground, near Nelson, I-575, as well as the freeway portion of the highway, terminates, and SR 5, now concurrent with SR 515, enters Pickens County. The highways curve northwest around Jasper, then turn back to the north near Talking Rock on their way into Gilmer County and Ellijay. In East Ellijay, SR 5 picks up a concurrency with US 76/SR 2, and heads northeast into the Chattahoochee National Forest in the direction of Blue Ridge in Fannin County. In Blue Ridge, US 76/SR 2/SR 515 head off to the east, while SR 5 heads northwest to McCaysville and its northern terminus at the Tennessee state line, where the route intersects the northern terminus of SR 60 (Toccoa Avenue) and continues into Tennessee as SR 68 (which also has the Toccoa Avenue name). =National Highway System= The following portions of SR 5 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: *The entire concurrency with SR 92 (on US 78/SR 8) in Douglasville *The entire concurrency with US 41/SR 3 in Marietta *From the southern end of the I-75 concurrency, in Marietta, to the Tennessee state line =Traffic= The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) average annual daily traffic (AADT) numbers for the year 2011 show a variety of average daily traffic load numbers as the route travels across western and northern Georgia. At the route's western portion in rural Carroll County, daily vehicle load averages hover around 3,000, with a route low seen west of US 27 at just over 1,000 vehicles per day. Averages quickly rise from about 7,500 vehicles north of SR 166 to reach numbers near 22,000 around I-20, then level off between 10,000 and 15,000 between Douglasville and Austell. Vehicle loads climb again north of Austell, reaching numbers between 27,000 and 38,000 between Austell and Marietta. Once SR 5 becomes concurrent with I-575, averages increase drastically, with a route high of 93,000 vehicles seen south of Woodstock, close to I-75. Numbers generally decrease as the route travels further north, going from the mark seen in Woodstock down to 59,000 in Holly Springs, around 55,000 in Canton, and further down to 26,000 near Ball Ground. Once the freeway portion of the route ends in Pickens County, averages fall further from around 24,000 to around 12,000, but stabilize in that vicinity from Talking Rock in Pickens County all the way through Ellijay in Gilmer County to Blue Ridge in Fannin County. As SR 5 approaches its northern terminus, vehicle load decreases once more to a low of 7,200, and hovers around 9,000 as the Tennessee state line is reached. =\\"Old Highway 5\\"= With the construction of I-575 and other projects between Cobb and Gilmer counties, SR 5 saw significant routing changes in the 1980s and 1990 (see History below for additional details). All of the former routing of SR 5, parallel to I-575, and the new routing in Pickens and Gilmer counties, still exists today, and is utilized by local traffic. From the northbound exit 267A on I-75, the old routing of SR 5 follows what is today locally known as Canton Road Connector (and is signed as SR 5 Spur), which merges into Canton Road. This routing parallels I-575 very closely to its east as the old SR 5 routing heads north through the heart of Woodstock. The local road name changes to Main Street through Woodstock, and to Holly Springs Parkway on its way to Holly Springs, where it crosses under I-575 to its west at exit 14. As the old route travels through Canton, it becomes briefly concurrent with SR 140 (and is signed as SR 5 Bus.), then crosses under I-575 once more to its east again (at exit 20), and heads northeast as Ball Ground Highway. Rarely more than separate the old routing and I-575/SR 5/SR 515, as the old SR 5 passes through the heart of Ball Ground (where it is again signed as SR 5 Bus.), and it briefly becomes concurrent with SR 372. \\"Old Highway 5\\" continues north as Canton Road/Canton Highway, now somewhat further removed from the current SR 5, and travels through Nelson, then becomes concurrent with SR 53 Bus. into Jasper. North of Jasper, the former routing of SR 5 has become a minor roadway and is known as Talking Rock Road to Talking Rock, where it briefly becomes concurrent with SR 136, then heads north as Ellijay Road, having crossed to the west of the current SR 5 together with SR 136\\\\. Paralleling SR 5 very closely once more, the former routing travels through downtown Ellijay, crosses the Ellijay River, and merges into the current US 76/SR 5/SR 515 north of East Ellijay. History =1920s= SR 5 was established at least as early as 1919 from SR 3 in Marietta to the Tennessee state line north-northwest of Blue Ridge. SR 8 was established at this time on the path of SR 5 from Douglasville to Austell. By the end of 1926, US 78 was designated on SR 8 between Douglasville and Austell. The Pickens County portion of the Canton–Jasper segment of SR 5 had a \\"completed hard surface\\". Two segments had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\": the Cherokee County portion of the Canton–Jasper segment and the southern half of the segment from Blue Ridge to the Tennessee state line. Two segments had a \\"sand clay or top soil\\": the Douglasville–Austell segment of US 78/SR 8 and the Cherokee County portion of the Marietta–Canton segment of SR 5\\\\. Two segments were under construction: the Jasper–Ellijay segment and the northern half of the Blue Ridge–Tennessee segment. By the end of 1929, two segments had a completed hard surface: a small portion just north of the Cobb–Cherokee county line and from a point northeast of Canton to just north of the Pickens–Gilmer county line. Two segments had a completed semi hard surface: nearly the entire Gilmer County portion of the Jasper–Ellijay segment (except for the extreme southern part) and the northern half of the Blue Ridge–Tennessee segment. The Ellijay–Blue Ridge segment was under construction. =1930s= By the middle of 1930, the southern part of the Gilmer County portion of the Jasper–Ellijay segment had a completed hard surface. By the end of the year, the segment from Blue Ridge to the Tennessee state line also was completed. The entire Cobb County portion of the Marietta–Canton segment was under construction. By the end of 1931, the Douglasville–Austell segment of US 78/SR 8 had a completed hard surface. Three segments of SR 5 also were completed: from Marietta to the halfway point between the Cobb–Cherokee county line and Canton, from northeast of Canton to Ellijay, and from northeast of Ellijay to Blue Ridge. The southern two-thirds of the Ellijay–Blue Ridge segment had a sand clay or top soil surface. Between April and August 1932, a portion south of Canton had a sand clay or top soil surface. A portion northeast of Canton was under construction. In August, the portion south of Canton was under construction. In October, a small portion at the northern terminus was under construction. By May 1933, the entire length of SR 5 from Marietta to Ellijay had a completed hard surface. In May, the northern terminus had a completed semi hard surface. In July, the entire Blue Ridge–Tennessee state line had a completed hard surface. In the third quarter of 1935, the Ellijay–Blue Ridge segment was also completed. By the end of the year, a portion northeast of Ellijay was under construction. In the first quarter of 1937, SR 5 was extended southwest from Marietta to SR 6 in Powder Springs. The next year, a portion of the extension southwest of Marietta had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1939, the central portion of this extension was under construction. In the third quarter of the year, this portion had completed grading, but was not surfaced. =1940s= Between April and October 1940, SR 5 was established on a segment from SR 16 in Whitesburg to Douglasville. There was no indication if the two segments were connected via concurrencies with US 78/SR 8 from Douglasville to Austell and SR 6 from Austell to Powder Springs. By the end of the year, SR 5 was extended from Whitesburg west-southwest to US 27/SR 1 in Roopville, northwest to Bowdon, south-southwest on a concurrency with SR 100, then southwest solely to the Alabama state line. Between the beginning of 1945 and November 1946, the portion north-northeast of Bucktown and the portion from the south- southeastern part of Bowdon to the Carroll–Douglas county line were indicated to be \\"projected mileage\\". Two segments of the highway were hard surfaced: a portion south-southwest of Bowdon and the northern part of the Powder Springs–Marietta segment. By February 1948, three segments had a sand clay or top soil surface: from the Alabama state line to a point south-southwest of Bowdon, the northern two-thirds of the McWhorter–Douglasville segment, and the southern part of the Powder Springs–Marietta segment. By April 1949, the segment from Alabama to Roopville was shifted southward to a more direct path. =1950s to 1970s= Between August 1950 and the beginning of 1952, the entire Powder Springs–Marietta segment had a completed hard surface. A portion north- northeast of McWhorter had a sand clay or top soil surface. In 1953, the northern two-thirds of the McWhorter–Douglasville segment was hard surfaced. A portion east of Roopville had a sand clay or top soil surface. Three segments had completed grading, but was not surfaced: from the Alabama state line to Roopville, the Carroll County portion of the Whitesburg–McWhorter segment, and a portion north-northeast of McWhorter. Between June 1955 and July 1957, a portion east of Roopville had completed grading, but was not surfaced. Between July 1957 and June 1960, three segments were paved: the central portion of the Bucktown–Roopville segment, the western half of the Roopville–Whitesburg segment, and from southwest of Whitesburg to north-northeast of McWhorter. By June 1963, the segment from west-northwest of Tyus to Roopville was paved. By the end of 1965, the segment from the Alabama to east-southeast of Lowell was hard surfaced. The segment from east-southeast of Lowell to south-southwest of Whitesburg had a \\"topsoil or gravel\\" surface. At this time, SR 5 Byp. was built and hard surfaced from US 76/SR 5 southwest of Blue Ridge to SR 5 north of the city. In 1966, SR 5 was hard surfaced from Alabama to Douglasville. In 1973, SR 705 was proposed from SR 3 (Church Street) in Marietta to SR 5 south of Blackwell, with an interchange with I-75. In 1977, I-575/SR 713 was proposed from I-75 north of Marietta to just south of the Cherokee–Pickens county line. It was completed from SR 140 south of Canton to SR 20 east of the city. The next year, the entire Cobb County portion (except for the southern end) of I-575/SR 713 was under construction. SR 5 through Blue Ridge was shifted westward, replacing the entire length of SR 5 Byp. Its former path through the city was redesignated as SR 5 Bus. By the end of the decade, SR 733 was proposed between two intersections with US 76/SR 5 northeast of Ellijay. At this time, SR 734 was proposed from US 76/SR 5 south-southwest of Cherry Log, across US 76/SR 5 north-northeast of Cherry Log, and then to another intersection with US 76/SR 5 in Lucius. =1980s and 1990s= By March 1980, I-575/SR 713 was completed to SR 92 southwest of Woodstock and one exit to the south in the Canton area. SR 713 was proposed to be extended northwest to SR 5 in Talking Rock. SR 713 Spur was proposed from SR 5 to SR 713 at the northern terminus of I-575. SR 719 was proposed from SR 5 south-southwest of Ellijay to US 76/SR 5 northeast of that city. Later that year, the southern completed part of I-575/SR 713 was extended south to I-75. The next year, SR 5's path from south of Nelson to southeast of Talking Rock was shifted westward, replacing SR 713 Spur and the northern extension of SR 713\\\\. The former path of SR 5 was redesignated as SR 5 Alt. At this time, SR 719 was under construction. In 1982, I-575/SR 713 was under construction from SR 92 southwest of Woodstock to south of Canton and from east of Canton to I-575's northern terminus north-northwest of Ball Ground. SR 713 was proposed to be extended northwest to SR 5 west-northwest of Talking Rock and north to the southern terminus of SR 719 at SR 5. The next year, SR 5's path from Powder Springs to Marietta was shifted eastward, replacing SR 340\\\\. I-575/SR 713 was completed from SR 92 southwest of Woodstock to south of Canton. SR 5 in the Ellijay area was shifted eastward. US 76/SR 282 was extended southeast to East Ellijay to rejoin it. This shifting of SR 5 replaced SR 719\\\\. The former path of SR 5 was redesignated as SR 5 Alt. In 1985, SR 5's path from Marietta to northeast of Canton was shifted westward, onto I-575. Its former path from Marietta to Lebanon was redesignated as SR 754\\\\. I-575 was completed northeast to a point southwest of Ball Ground. SR 5's path from Talking Rock to south- southwest of Ellijay was shifted westward, replacing all of SR 713. In 1986, all of I-575 was completed. SR 5's path from northeast of Canton to north- northwest of Ball Ground was shifted westward, onto I-575. The northern part was redesignated as a northern extension of SR 372. Between 1981 and 1986, SR 5's path in the Ball Ground–Nelson area was shifted westward, onto I-575. Part of the former path was redesignated as a northern extension of SR 372. In 1989, SR 515 was designated on SR 5 from I-575's northern terminus west of Nelson to Blue Ridge. Between 1984 and 1991, US 76/SR 5/SR 515 was shifted onto the path of SR 733 and SR 734, replacing them. =Georgia designated roadways= On March 28, 1988, SR 5 was designated as \\"Chieftains Trail\\" between Canton and Ellijay. On April 28, 1999, SR 5 was designated as \\"C. F. 'Coote' Mason Highway\\" between the end of its concurrency with SR 515 and its northern terminus. In 2005, the interchange between SR 5 and SR 515 in Blue Ridge was designated as the \\"A. L. Stepp Interchange\\". Major intersections Special routes =Marietta spur route (1972–1983)= State Route 5 Spur (SR 5 Spur) was a spur route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Marietta. In 1969, it was proposed to be established from SR 5 (Powder Springs Street) north-northwest to Polk Street. Between 1966 and 1973, it was actually established on this proposed path. By 1984, it was decommissioned. =Marietta spur route= State Route 5 Spur (SR 5 Spur) is a spur route of SR 5 that exists mostly within the city limits of Marietta. It starts at Church Street in the north-central part of the city. It travels to the north-northeast and has a partial interchange with US 41/SR 3/SR 5 (Cobb Parkway). It curves to the northeast and has an interchange with I-75/SR 5\\\\. The freeway portion of the highway ends at an intersection with the northern terminus of Sandy Plains Road and the southern terminus of Guffin Lane. The highway curves to the north-northwest and intersects Canton Road. SR 5 Spur travels on Canton Road for about one block. Just south of Kurtz Road, it reaches its northern terminus. The roadway that would eventually become SR 5 Spur was proposed between 1961 and 1966 as SR 705 from SR 5 southwest of Marietta to SR 5 in southern Cherokee County. By 1973, the interchange with I-75 and a short piece of SR 705 northeast of it were built. In 1976, SR 705 between I-75 and the northern intersection with SR 5 was built as SR 5 Conn. In 1984, SR 5 Conn. was redesignated as SR 5 Spur. SR 5's path north of Marietta was shifted westward, onto I-75 and I-575, replacing all of SR 705. Between 2004 and 2013, SR 5 Spur was extended to Church Street. =Marietta connector route= State Route 5 Connector (SR 5 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 5 that existed mostly in the north-central part of Marietta. Between 1954 and 1957, it was established from SR 3 (Church Street) in Elizabeth to US 41/SR 3E in Marietta. In 1984, it was decommissioned. =Cobb County connector route= State Route 5 Connector (SR 5 Conn.) was a connecting route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Cobb County. Between 1961 and 1966, SR 705 was proposed from SR 5 southwest of Marietta to SR 5 in the southern part of Cherokee County. By 1973, SR 705's interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) and a portion of the highway northeast of it was built. The proposed northern terminus was truncated to SR 5 northeast of Marietta. In 1976, SR 705's path from I-75 to its intersection with SR 5 northeast of Marietta was built as SR 5 Conn. In 1984, the same year that SR 5 was shifted westward, onto I-75 and I-575, SR 5 Conn. was redesignated as SR 5 Spur. =Kennesaw connector route= State Route 5 Connector (SR 5 Conn.) is a connecting route the partially exists in Kennesaw. It starts at the intersection of Barrett Parkway and US 41/SR 3 in Kennesaw, less than northwest of where the SR 5 main line crosses the same two highways. SR 5 Conn. heads northeast, locally known as Ernest W. Barrett Parkway on both sides of that intersection, and crosses Interstate 75 (I-75) just before passing by Town Center Mall. The connector terminates just east of its interchange with I-575/SR 5, where the roadway continues east as Piedmont Road. The entire length of SR 5 Conn. is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. =Canton spur route= State Route 5 Spur (SR 5 Spur) was a spur route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Cherokee County, mostly within the city limits of Canton. At least as early as 1940, it was established from SR 5/SR 205 south-southwest of Canton to SR 20 in the city. By 1954, SR 20 was rerouted in the area, replacing all of SR 5 Spur. =Canton business loop= State Route 5 Business (SR 5 Bus.) is a business route of SR 5 that exists in the central part of Cherokee County, entirely within the city limits of Canton. It begins at an interchange with I-575/SR 5 in the southern part of the city. At this interchange, SR 5 Bus. begins a concurrency with SR 20 and SR 140\\\\. The three highways travel to the east- northeast on a freeway. They curve to the northwest and split at Marietta Highway, with SR 5 Bus./SR 140 heading in a northerly direction. After crossing over the Etowah River, they pass Cherokee High School. After curving to the east-northeast, SR 140 splits off to the north. SR 5 Bus. passes the Riverplace Shopping Center and then intersects the northern terminus of SR 5 Conn. (Reinhardt College Parkway). It then has a second interchange with I-575/SR 5, where it reaches its northern terminus. Between 1981 and 1986, it was established on its current path. =Canton connector route= State Route 5 Connector (SR 5 Conn.) is a connecting route of SR 5 in the central part of Canton. It is known as Reinhardt College Parkway for its entire length. It is signed as a north–south highway, but it appears to be backward, since its \\"southern\\" terminus is north of its \\"northern\\" terminus. It begins at an intersection with SR 140\\\\. It travels to the east-southeast and curves to the east-northeast. It passes by some residential neighborhoods before curving to the south-southeast. It passes the Riverstone Village shopping center. It then curves to the southeast, passing the RiverStone Medical Center. Just before its northern terminus, it travels between the Mainstreet at RiverStone and RiverStone Plaza shopping centers. It meets its northern terminus, an intersection with SR 5 Bus. (RiverStone Parkway). At least as early as 1940, an unnumbered road was built on the current path of SR 5 Conn. Between 1997 and 2009, it was established. =Ball Ground business loop= State Route 5 Business (SR 5 Bus.) is a business route of SR 5 that exists in the northeastern part of Cherokee County and the south-central part of Pickens County. Part of it is in the city limits of Ball Ground. It starts at an interchange with I-575/SR 5 in the southwestern part of Ball Ground. It travels east-southeast on Howell Bridge Road to the intersection with Ball Ground Highway and Canton Highway. Both of these roads are former portions of SR 5\\\\. There, it turns left onto Canton Highway and travels to the north- northeast. It passes Ball Ground Elementary School before beginning a concurrency with SR 372 (A.W. Roberts Drive). The two highways continue to the north-northeast and leave Ball Ground. They turn to the left, onto Appalachian Highway, and curve to the northwest. After slipping through the southwestern corner of Nelson, they reach their northern terminus, an intersection with SR 5/SR 515 at the northern terminus of I-575. The highway that eventually became SR 5 Bus. was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 5 from the southeastern part of Ball Ground to west of Nelson. By the end of 1926, the Pickens County portion of this segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". The Cherokee County portion had a \\"completed semi hard surface\\". By the end of 1929, the entire aforementioned segment had a completed hard surface. Between the beginning of 1979 and March 1980, SR 713 Spur was proposed from SR 5 south of Nelson to the proposed path of SR 713 at the proposed northern terminus of I-575 south-southwest of Nelson. In 1981, the path of SR 5 in this area was shifted westward, replacing SR 713 Spur and the northern extension of SR 713\\\\. The former path of SR 5 was redesignated as SR 5 Alt. In 1986, SR 5's path from Canton to south of Nelson was shifted westward, onto I-575, replacing SR 713\\\\. Part of its former path was redesignated as a northern extension of SR 372. In 1990, SR 5 Bus. was established on its current path. =Cherokee–Pickens County alternate route= State Route 5 Alternate (SR 5 Alt.) was an alternate route of SR 5 that existed in the northeastern part of Cherokee County and the central part of Pickens County. In 1981, the path of SR 5 from a point south of Nelson to a point southeast of Talking Rock was shifted westward. This replaced SR 713 Spur and part of SR 713\\\\. The former path of SR 5 was redesignated as SR 5 Alt. In 1985, SR 5 replaced a little bit more of the proposed route of SR 713 west-northwest of Talking Rock. SR 5 Alt. was extended on the former path of SR 5. In 1986, it was decommissioned. =Gilmer County alternate route= State Route 5 Alternate (SR 5 Alt.) was a short-lived alternate route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Gilmer County. In 1983, SR 5 in the Ellijay area was shifted eastward. US 76/SR 282 was extended southeast to East Ellijay to rejoin it. This shifting of SR 5 replaced SR 719\\\\. The former path of SR 5 was redesignated as SR 5 Alt. In 1985, it was decommissioned. Its southern portion was redesignated as an eastern extension of SR 382. =Ellijay spur route= State Route 5 Spur (SR 5 Spur) was a short spur route of SR 5 that existed in the eastern part of Ellijay in the central part of Gilmer County. Between 1953 and 1960, it was established from SR 52 to US 76/SR 5. Between 1977 and 1980, it was decommissioned. =Blue Ridge bypass route= State Route 5 Bypass (SR 5 Byp.) was a bypass route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Fannin County, mostly within the city limits of Blue Ridge. Between June 1963 and the end of 1965, it was established from US 76/SR 5 south-southwest of the city to SR 5 in the northern part of it. Between 1974 and 1977, SR 5's path through the city was shifted westward, replacing SR 5 Byp. Part of its former path was redesignated as SR 5 Bus. =Blue Ridge business loop= State Route 5 Business (SR 5 Bus.) was a business route of SR 5 that existed in the central part of Fannin County, mostly within the city limits of Blue Ridge. Between 1974 and 1977, SR 5's path through Blue Ridge was shifted westward, replacing all of SR 5 Byp. In 1982, US 76 Bus. was established on the path of SR 5 Bus. In 1988, US 76 Bus./SR 5 Bus. was decommissioned.

A number of forward-looking daimyōs independently promulgated codes of conduct to be applied within a specific han or domain. Few examples of these daimyō-made law codes have survived, but the legal framework contrived by the Rokkaku clan remains amongst the small number of documents which can still be studied In 1567, the Rokkaku-shi shikimoku is promulgated.Katsumata Shizuo et al.

Then in 1572, Namazue was besieged and defeated by the forces of Oda Nobunaga, led by Shibata Katsuie. The series of defeat in the late 1560s and early 1570s signaled the end of the Rokkaku clan's independence.Sansom, George Bailey. (1961). A History of Japan: 1334-1615, pp. 278-279. The Rokkaku became vassals of Oda Nobunaga. Yoshisuke later served one of Nobunaga's former generals, Tokugawa Ieyasu. During the Edo period, his descendants were ranked amongst the kōke.

Wigmore taught law at Keio University in Tokyo (1889–1892) before becoming the first full-time dean of Northwestern Law School (1901–1929). His scholarship is best remembered for his Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law (1904), often simply called Wigmore on Evidence, and a graphical analysis method known as a Wigmore chart. Personal life and education John Henry Wigmore was born in San Francisco on March 4, 1863. His parents were John and Harriet Joyner Wigmore. He was named after his father, a self-made lumberyard owner. He was the second-oldest child of thirteen. Wigmore attended Harvard University and earned the degrees AB in 1883 and AM in 1884. Following his undergraduate work, he returned to San Francisco briefly, but then moved back to Cambridge to attend Harvard Law School where he received his LLB in 1887. While at Harvard, Wigmore was a member of the first ever editorial board of the Harvard Law Review. Following law school, Wigmore's parents expected him to return to San Francisco to run the family business. Wigmore instead elected to stay in Boston, causing a rift to develop between himself and his parents. Wigmore married Emma Hunt Vogl (b. July 26, 1860, d. 1943) of Cambridge, whom he had met during Law School, in September 1889. His parents did not attend the wedding. The couple departed for Tokyo just three days after their wedding. Career Following his graduation from Harvard, Wigmore practiced law in Boston. While in practice, he served as a \\"long-distance clerk\\" for New Hampshire Supreme Court Chief Justice Charles Doe and was mentored by future US Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. During this time he also published papers regarding election law reform issues including the secret voting method (also known as the Australian Ballot), and fair ballot access laws. = Keio University and comparative law = In 1889, Wigmore was recruited as a foreign advisor to Meiji period Empire of Japan, and was assigned to teach law at Keio University in Tokyo. Wigmore was the only full-time professor at the University at the time and was \\"instrumental\\" in designing the law curriculum. He served at Keio University until 1892. Once he arrived in Tokyo he \\"came under the spell of what is called Comparative Law\\", although his interest pre-dated his experiences in Japan. A key legacy of his time in Japan was a detailed study of the laws of the Tokugawa shogunate in Edo period Japan, which he edited and published as a series of papers while at Keio University. The collection of papers grew to 15 volumes under the collected title of Materials for the Study of Private Law in Old Japan before its completion in the mid-1930s.\\"Edits Japanese Law Data; Prof. Wigmore Completing Work on Records of 1600–1860,\\" New York Times. June 23, 1935. Wigmore maintained his interest in comparative law for the rest of his life, becoming a prominent writer in the field and has been referred to as the \\"father of American comparative law\\", although some critics found his work \\"imaginary\\" and \\"needlessly uncritical\\". Despite his prominence, he is remembered more for popularizing the field of comparative law than for his scholarly contributions to it. His continuing fascination with similarities between legal systems around the world is evident in a 1932 article: \\"The legal profession throughout the world has the strongest ties that ought to bind, - ties of sentiment, ties of public duty, ties of common experience in human nature.\\" He was also a manager of the 1907-founded Comparative Law Bureau of the American Bar Association, whose Annual Bulletin was the first comparative law journal in the United States. =Northwestern University Law School= Wigmore accepted a teaching post at Northwestern University and returned to the United States in 1893. He taught torts, comparative law, and evidence. He became the first full-time dean of Northwestern Law School in 1901. In 1906, Wigmore helped establish the Northwestern University Law Review, which was a faculty-run publication in the early days. During his career at Northwestern, Wigmore \\"transformed a relatively modest institution into one of the leading law schools in the United States.\\" As a result of his successes, he was actively recruited by rival institutions including Yale and Columbia. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to Northwestern. In 1926, a 37-note carillon was commissioned and installed at the Law School. Now known as the \\"Wigmore Chimes,\\" the carillon plays the \\"Counselor's Chorus,\\" a song written by Wigmore for the Law School. Wigmore served as Dean of Northwestern Law until 1929. Following his deanship, he remained a professor at the Law School taking emeritus status in 1934. He continued his work at Northwestern until his death on April 20, 1943 in a \\"freakish\\" taxi accident. His widow, Emma, died just four months later. Wigmore continues to be honored by the University: he is the namesake of a prominent alumni club and the annual student-run \\"Law School musical\\" is called the Wigmore Follies.  Military service  In 1915, General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General of the Army, asked Wigmore to become a reserve officer. Following the United States’ declaration of war on Germany, Wigmore was activated to duty as a major serving with the Judge Advocate General's Office in Washington DC. By 1918 he was promoted colonel. His wartime duties included advising the War Department on labor law, liability for patent infringements on German pharmaceuticals, and the law of war. He also had a significant role in the drafting of the Selective Service Act of 1917 and the Espionage Act, At the conclusion of the war, he sided with Crowder over General Samuel Ansell who insisted that courts-martial were in need of reform.Joshua E. Kastenberg, To Raise and Discipline an Army: Major General Enoch Crowder, the Judge Advocate General's Office, and the Realignment of Civil and Military Relations in World War I(DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2017), 80–114 Wigmore's legacy is made apparent in a 1917 U.S. Army Military Law manual which credits the chapters on 'Evidence' to \\"the assistance of Prof. Wigmore of Northwestern University, recently commissioned a major and judge advocate in the Officers' Reserve Corps.\\" Following his military service, Wigmore's preferred mode of address became \\"Colonel\\" and remained so for the rest of his life.  Writings and scholarship  Wigmore's high productivity as a writer was noted by his contemporaries. In examining his life's work, one biographer calculated that \\"[t]he sheer magnitude of [his] achievement is [...] more than 18 feet of shelf space or an entire section of standard library shelving.\\" consisting of over 900 books and other works. In 1943, the Association of American Law Schools claimed \\"no great law writer or even any great novelist, such as Scott or Dumas, ... appears to match Dean Wigmore in the volume of published achievement.\\" =Wigmore on Evidence= In 1904 Wigmore began publication of his most famous work, a treatise that would serve as an encyclopedic survey of the development of the law of evidence. This massive work, referred to as Wigmore on Evidence or just Wigmore (see § Select works for edition titles), was the product of \\"10 years of monastic toil.\\" Over the course of the next forty years, the initial four-volume treatise would swell to ten volumes containing over 85,000 judicial citations. Contemporary reviews would declare the \\"sun of Evidence does pretty much 'rise and set in Wigmore'\\". Wigmore's peers called the Treatise \\"one of the greatest intellectual feats in law- writing of any age or any country.\\" US Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter called the Treatise \\"unrivaled as the greatest treatise on any single subject of the law.\\" Wigmore on Evidence was probably the most \\"heavily cited law text of its day\\" and the dominant source of US evidentiary law up until the codification of the Federal Rules of Evidence in 1975. Wigmore was a strong advocate of a standard Code of Evidence and participated in a 1938 effort by the American Bar Association and the American Law Institute to produce a Model Code. This Model Code later became a basis for the Uniform Rules of Evidence drafted in the 1950s which was then used to help draft the Federal Rules of Evidence. Today the Federal Rules of Evidence have become the primary modern doctrinal basis for the law of evidence in US federal trials and serve as the basis on which many states have modeled their evidence rules.

Name The range was originally named on 6 June 1879 by the explorer Alexander Forrest, during an expedition in the Kimberley area, after King Leopold II of Belgium, \\"for the great interest taken by His Majesty in exploration\\". There had been several proposals and attempts to rename the range, given its link to Leopold II of Belgium, whose reign over the Congo Free State beginning in 1885 is claimed to have resulted in the deaths of 10 to 15 million African people. Leopold had no connection with Western Australia, but a number of geographic features in the Pilbara and Kimberley were named after European royalty. The renaming was proposed in 2008, and again in 2017, but was delayed as due to the range's size spanning several different regions and native title claimant areas, negotiations with traditional owners to decide a name were ongoing. In 2020, prompted by the removal of a statue of Leopold II in the city of Antwerp as part of a reconsideration of various names throughout the world, Lands Minister Ben Wyatt stated that he hoped to establish consensus on a name with the two main native title groups and would then quickly proceed with the name change. The range was officially renamed on the 1 July 2020 by Lands Minister Ben Wyatt. Physiography The ranges are a distinct physiographic section of the larger Kimberley Block province, which in turn is part of the larger West Australian Shield division.

Fitzroy Bluff is formed where the Fitzroy River carves through the area. The ranges separate the main Kimberley plateau from the southern Fitzroy plains and consist of quartz sandstone intruded by dolerite. The ranges are shaped like a crescent with a length of running from the northern end of the Durack Range in the East to east of Secure Bay in the West Kimberley. The range is estimated to cover a total area of . The area has an average height . The highest point is found at Mount Wells which is above mean sea level. The next two highest peaks are Mount Ord at and Mount Broome at . History The traditional owners of the area are the Ngarinjin, Konejandi and Bunuba peoples. Cattle were first overlanded across the range in 1903. Leaving from Fitzroy Crossing and used to stock Mount Barnett Station, the trip took over six weeks to complete. Management Crossed by the Gibb River Road about east of Derby, part of the ranges are covered by the Miliwundi Range Conservation Park, within the range is managed by the Department of Parks and Wildlife.

It is the largest trauma centre in Canada and one of two trauma centres in Toronto; the other being St. Michael's Hospital. Sunnybrook is a teaching hospital, fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. The hospital is home to Canada's largest veterans centre, located in the Kilgour Wing and the George Hees Wing of the hospital, where World War II and Korean War veterans are cared for. Sunnybrook made surgical breakthroughs in its history, including in 2015 when the world's first non-invasive opening of the blood–brain barrier was done. History Sunnybrook Hospital had its origins as the Toronto Military Orthopaedic Hospital at 350 Christie Street, which was also known as the Christie Street Military Hospital and, after 1936, the Christie Street Veterans' Hospital. The Collegiate Gothic building had originally been the site of the National Cash Register Company Factory in 1913 (by architects Page and Warrington) but was converted for use as a military hospital in 1919 to house soldiers injured during World War I as well as some veterans disabled in the Boer War of 1899 to 1902 and the Fenian Raids of 1866. The influx of disabled soldiers returning from World War II led to overcrowding and the need for a new hospital. The original site was demolished in 1981 and replaced by Christie Gardens Apartments and Care Facility at 600 Melita Crescent. Joseph and Alice Kilgour, a wealthy Toronto couple, purchased 154 acres in the town of Leaside, Ontario and created Sunnybrook farm, where they raised horses and hosted fox hunts. In 1928, after Joseph's death, Alice M. Kilgour donated the Sunnybrook Farm to the City of Toronto in his memory, for use as a public park.\\"Once Upon a City: From foxhunts to foxholes\\". Toronto Star, August 28, 2016. Janice Bradbeer. With the consent of the Kilgour heirs, part of the parkland was transferred to the Government of Canada to build a hospital for veterans to replace the Christie Street Hospital. The new building was designed by Allward and Gouinlock (Hugh Allward was son of sculptor Walter Seymour Allward and George H. Gouinlock is the son of architect George Wallace Gouinlock). The first patient was admitted to Sunnybrook Military Hospital in September 1946. The hospital officially opened its doors in June 1948. The Christie Street hospital was converted into a senior citizens home named Lambert Lodge. In 1973, Sunnybrook Military Hospital became Sunnybrook Medical Centre, and in 1976 established Canada's first regional trauma unit. In 1991, The Province of Ontario opened major research facilities to house the rapid growth of research on campus. The hospital merged with Women's College Hospital and the Orthopaedic and Arthritic Hospital in June 1998 under the provisions of Bill 51, but Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Sciences Centre was de-amalgamated in April 2006 to create Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the separate Women's College Hospital. On July 1, 2012, Sunnybrook and St. John's Rehab Hospital, which had complementary programs and services, voluntarily merged, providing a continuum of care from acute injury or illness, through to rehabilitation and recovery. In 2016, Sunnybrook maintains three campuses, with its main campus (Bayview) on Bayview Avenue in North York, the satellite Holland Centre (orthopaedic and arthritic care) on Wellesley St. E., and St. John's Rehab on Cummer Avenue. SHSC became affiliated with the University of Toronto in 1966. On January 25, 2020, Canada's first 'presumptive positive' case of the viral Coronavirus, was supposedly brought into Canada by a 50-year-old man who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China. It was reported and admitted into the hospital. Areas of focus =Veterans Program= Sunnybrook has the largest veterans care facility in Canada. It is partnered with Veterans Affairs Canada, and provides long-term and complex hospital care to about 500 World War II and Korean War veterans. Staff provide three categories of care to veterans: physical support, cognitive support and palliative care. The Veterans Centre is located in the Kilgour and George Hees wings of the hospital. Research is conducted through the Veterans & Community research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =Hurvitz Brain Sciences Program= The program provides care to people with brain-related disorders and conditions. The program's main areas of focus include stroke, dementias and mood and anxiety disorders. Brain sciences research is also conducted through the Hurvitz Brain Sciences research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =Holland Musculoskeletal Program= The program focuses on musculoskeletal injury, total joint replacement and major biological restoration. Areas of expertise include traumatic injury management; joint reconstruction and replacement; rehabilitation; rheumatology; sports injury management; and complex upper and lower limb surgery. Musculoskeletal research is also conducted through the Holland musculoskeletal research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =DAN Women and Babies Program= The program provides pre-conception, pregnancy, birth and post-birth care to pregnant women, including those with high-risk pregnancies. It also provides gynecological care to patients. The program also has a neonatal intensive-care unit (NICU). The NICU is a high-risk regional neonatal nursery, and one of three serving the Central East Region of Ontario. They care for infants requiring Level III or Level II neonatal care. In 2017, the program opened North America's first pregnancy clinic for women with physical mobility disabilities. Research in obstetrics, neonatology, obstetrical anaesthesia and women's reproductive health is also conducted through the Women & Babies research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =Schulich Heart Program= The program is named for Seymour Schulich a Canadian businessman and philanthropist from Montreal. The centre, as per the name, is a cardiac care centre providing treatment, prevention and care of heart diseases. The centre performs heart surgeries, tests and procedures, including various minimally invasive heart procedures. Research is also conducted through the Schulich heart research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =Odette Cancer Program= The Odette Cancer Program provides care to patients with various types and stages of cancer. The centre also has a focus on cancer prevention, detection and patient education. Various clinical trials are also run out of the centre. Research is conducted through the Odette Cancer Centre research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. Research spans from the topics of basic genetics, biochemistry and biology of cancer. =Tory Trauma Program= The program provides critical care and trauma care to patients. The emergency department is open 24 hours a day. The trauma centre is the largest in Canada, providing emergency medical services to patients suffering traumatic, life-threatening injuries. The trauma program also works in conjunction with the Ross Tilley Burn Centre. Research is also conducted through the Tory Trauma research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =St. John's Rehab= St. John's Rehab Program provides specialized rehabilitation, education and support for people recovering from complex, life-changing illnesses and injuries, including: amputations, cancer, cardiovascular surgery, organ transplants, orthopaedic conditions, stroke and neurological conditions, traumatic injuries and complex medical procedures and conditions. It is home to Canada's only organ transplant rehabilitation program and Ontario's only burn rehabilitation program. Rehabilitation research is also conducted through the St. John's Rehab research program through Sunnybrook Research Institute. =Integrated Community Program= The Integrated Community Program was established to ensure that the transition from hospital to the next step is one where everyone involved is both informed and engaged. This program also includes Sunnybrook's emergency care Heliport A helicopter pad is located at the east end of the hospital grounds. Sunnybrook handles air ambulance flights with urgent trauma cases from the Greater Toronto Area where an ambulance run is not possible. Only two other hospitals in Toronto have helipads (St. Michael's Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children). The hospital has been equipped with helipad.https://sunnybrook.ca/content/?page=helipad since 1977.https://www.skiesmag.com/news/celebrating-legacy-bandage-1/ Sunnybrook is planning to build a new helipad on the roof of the building's M-Wing. The current helipad is ground based and located from the emergency department and require ambulatory transfer. Private, for-profit cancer clinic Sunnybrook Hospital was the site of Ontario's first private cancer clinic created since the inception of Medicare. The clinic operated after regular working hours at the hospital, and was owned by Tim McGowan. An investigation by the Auditor General of Ontario revealed that the cost per procedure was $500 greater than in the public sector and that the waiting times did not decrease in the public system as a result of the clinic's creation.Office of the Provincial Auditor General, Special Audit of Cancer Care Ontario.

Impressed by the man's hunting, Sylvester consents to being his guest but, upon finding that he is the only guest, feels his hand is being forced. As the visit progresses he regrets his visit and considers Phoebe to be insipid and talentless. Phoebe's step-mother tactlessly tells Phoebe that Sylvester has come to make her an offer of marriage. Terrified of being made to marry Sylvester and getting no sympathy from her father, Phoebe calls upon a childhood friend, Tom Orde, to help her run away to live with her grandmother, Lady Ingham, in London. Phoebe is unaware that Lady Ingham is the person who suggested Sylvester marry her. Sylvester is happy to have an excuse to return to London and comes across their carriage which has had an accident. Sylvester decides to help them, and he realizes that Phoebe is extremely smart and capable, though very impertinent. He is very angry when he learns why Phoebe ran away but decides to take her to her grandmother to punish Lady Ingham (whom he presumes will not want Phoebe living with her) for having sent him to Phoebe's family in the first place. Sylvester later visits Phoebe in London with the intention of being charming to her to make her sorry for slighting him. Phoebe meets Lady Ianthe, the silly widow of Sylvester's twin brother, who is convinced that Sylvester is evil because he is executing his brother's will exactly: her young son, Edmund, must live with Sylvester at the family home of Chance. Phoebe is struck by the parallels between the real Sylvester and the arrogant parody of him in a book which she has written and which is about to be published. She attempts to change her manuscript, but her publishers say that it is too late to do so. When her novel The Lost Heir is published, it fascinates London because of the perfect satirization of the members of high society who try to find the identity of author. Lady Ianthe, Sylvester's sister-in-law, takes the fairy tale novel seriously. Phoebe, in protesting against this absurdity, accidentally lets slip that she is the author. Naturally, Lady Ianthe cannot keep her peace, and soon all London society is agog. Sylvester, having decided to scotch the rumour, is so hurt by Phoebe's portrayal of him that he insults Phoebe in public, which causes a scandal and confirms Phoebe as the author. Lady Ingham decides to take Phoebe away to France with Tom Orde as their escort. Unfortunately, Lady Ianthe and her new husband, foppish Sir Nugent Fotherby, are going to France on their honeymoon with Edmund, her son, from the same port. Lady Ianthe has got the idea of taking Edmund away to France from a plot in Phoebe's novel. Phoebe tries to intervene and boards the schooner with Tom where they are 'kidnapped' by Fotherby, who orders the skipper to set sail. Edmund is sea-sick and Lady Ianthe is ill so Phoebe and Tom take over the care of the small child. Phoebe writes to Lady Ingham and Sylvester from France, but Sylvester catches up with them before he receives the letter. At first he is overjoyed to see Phoebe but then blames her for helping Lady Ianthe to kidnap Edmund but Sylvester needs Phoebe to look after Edmund on the journey back to England. Sylvester complains of all the scrapes which Phoebe has embroiled him in and, in turn, Phoebe accuses Sylvester of ruining her reputation. Sylvester, having realised that he loves Phoebe, clumsily proposes marriage but Phoebe is outraged by the perceived sarcasm. Sylvester runs to his mother for help. She arranges to meet Phoebe to explain that Sylvester's arrogance has arisen from the grief he suffered after the loss of his twin brother and how much he loves Phoebe. Sylvester is summoned and again declares himself upon which Phoebe is only too happy to accept his proposal.

The Silent Cry (Japanese 万延元年のフットボール; Man'en Gannen no Futtoboru, literally 'Football in the First Year of Man'en') is a novel by Japanese author Kenzaburō Ōe, first published in Japanese in 1967 and awarded the Tanizaki Prize that year. Plot The novel tells the story of two brothers in the early 1960s: Mitsusaburo, the narrator, a one-eyed, married an English professor in Tokyo; and his younger brother Takashi, who has just returned from the US. Mitsusaburo and his wife Natsumi have been through a series of crises. They left their physically and mentally handicapped baby in an institution, while Mitsusaburo's friend committed suicide (he painted his head crimson, inserted a cucumber in his anus and hanged himself). Natsumi has become an alcoholic. Mitsusaburo leaves his job and they all travel to the brothers' home village, set in a hollow in the forest on Shikoku. The brothers' family had been one of the leading families in the village. Takashi is obsessed with the memory of their great- grandfather's younger brother, who led a peasant revolt in 1860. Mitsusaburo remembers the affair differently, believing that the leader of the rebellion betrayed his followers. They similarly disagree over the death of their older brother, S, who was killed in a raid on the Korean settlement near the village. Takashi revels in his warrior's death, while Mitsusaburo recalls him as volunteering to be killed in retaliation for the death of a Korean in an earlier raid. Their sister, also mentally retarded, had committed suicide while living with Takashi. Takashi has agreed to sell the family's kura- yashiki — a traditional residence-storehouse — to 'the Emperor', a Korean originally brought to the village as a slave-worker but who has now gained a position of economic dominance, turning the village's other kura-yashiki into a supermarket which has put the smaller shops out of business. Secretly, he has also agreed to sell the Emperor all the family's land. Takashi begins to organise the youths of the village into a group, beginning with football training. When Mitsusaburo discovers Takashi's deception, he isolates himself from the others, but his wife sides with Takashi. Mitsusaburo goes to live in the kura-yashiki, while Takashi moves his group into the family's main building. Takashi uses his group to begin an uprising against the Emperor, looting the supermarket and distributing the goods among the people. Takashi also begins a sexual relationship with Natsumi and sends one of his followers to tell Mitsusaburo. The people eventually become disenchanted, however; eventually a girl is killed. Takashi claims that he tried to rape her and then murdered her. He is abandoned by his group and waits for the villagers to come and lynch or arrest him. Mitsusaburo, however, does not believe his story and says that Takashi is using the girl's accidental death as a way to engineer his own violent death. Takashi admits to Mitsusaburo that their sister killed herself after he ended an incestuous relationship with her. After Mitsusaburo scorns Takashi's belief that he will be killed, Takashi shoots himself, writing as a final statement, 'I told the truth'. The Emperor comes and begins demolishing the kura-yashiki. A secret basement is discovered in which the brother of the great-grandfather had spent the rest of his life hiding after the failure of his rebellion. Mitsusaburo and Natsumi decide to try to live together again, along with their handicapped baby and Takashi's unborn child, which Natsumi is carrying. Mitsusaburo decides against a return to his old job, instead taking up an offer to work as a translator with a wildlife expedition to Africa. Literary significance & criticism The Japanese title connects the date of the rebellion (1860, the first year of the Man'en era, and also the year of Japan's first embassy to the US) with the American influence on Japan represented by the Japan-US Mutual Security Treaty of 1960 and by the (American) football with which Takashi begins his own uprising. Ōe in a later essay compared the imagination of the writer to a clamp connecting the horizontal narrative with the vertical relationship between the two eras.Ōe Kenzaburo, ‘The Football of Simultaneity’ (Doujisai no futtoboru) in The Enduring Volition (1968) p. 403. Ōe also drew a parallel between the back and forth motion of the football being passed and the reciprocal relationship between the stories of the two eras.Ōe p. 408. Michiko Wilson extends the comparison to the thesis-antithesis relationships between the violent and penitential sides of Takashi's character and between the passive, intellectual Mitsusaburo and the active Takashi who is in touch with nature.Wilson, Michiko, The Marginal World of Ōe Kenzaburo p. 50. Susan Napier emphasises the mythical aspect of the story in her study of the novel. Like many of his earlier works, The Silent Cry has an unreal Arcadian setting, cut off from the rest of Japan and populated with grotesque characters. She argues that the climax of the book, Takashi's suicide, cannot be explained merely as prompted by his guilt over his relations with his sister. Rather, his death is a sacrifice necessary, in terms of the myth, for the redemption of Mitsusaburo and of the village; his incestuous relationship is merely a pretext for the sacrifice.Napier, Susan, Escape from the Wasteland: Romanticism and Realism in the Fiction of Mishima Yukio and Ōe Kenzaburo, Harvard (1991), pp. 185–86. The Silent Cry is widely seen as a key work in Ōe's oeuvre. It is the only novel (other than The Game of Contemporaneity) to which Wilson devotes a whole chapter in her survey of Ōe's works, while Napier sees it as a turning point in his output between his smaller-scale early works and the broader canvases of the later novels. As such it is, \\"perhaps his most successful effort to encapsulate Japanese history, society, and politics within a single tight narrative\\".Napier, p. 196. The novel also marks an end to Ōe's series of works depicting pairs of brothers in pastoral settings, a hiatus which lasted until 1980's The Trial of 'Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids'.

(December 15, 1877 – April 22, 1950) was an Irish-born clergyman of the Roman Catholic Church. A Dominican, he served as Bishop of Duluth (1918–1925) and Archbishop of Cincinnati (1925–1950). Early life and education McNicholas was born in Kiltimagh, County Mayo, the youngest child of Patrick J. and Mary (née Mullany) McNicholas. In 1881, he and his family emigrated to the United States, where they settled in Chester, Pennsylvania. He received his early education at Immaculate Heart of Mary School in Chester, and then attended St. Joseph's Preparatory College in Philadelphia. In 1894, at the age of seventeen, he entered the Order of Friars Preachers (more commonly known as the Dominicans) at St. Rose Priory in Springfield, Kentucky. He continued his studies at St. Joseph Priory in Somerset, Ohio, where he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Henry K. Moeller on October 10, 1901. He took the first name John as his religious name. Priesthood Following his ordination, McNicholas went to Rome to study in the Dominican studium at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, where he obtained a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree in 1904. He returned to the United States later that year, and assumed the role of master of novices at St. Joseph Priory in Somerset. The following year he was sent to Immaculate Conception College in Washington, D.C., where he served as regent of studies and professor of philosophy, theology, and canon law. In 1909, McNicholas became the national director of the Holy Name Society, headquartered in New York City. He also served as the first editor of the Holy Name Journal and as pastor of St. Catherine of Siena Church. He remained in New York until 1917, when he returned to Rome as an assistant to the Master of the Order of Preachers and a professor of theology and canon law at the Angelicum University. Episcopacy On July 18, 1918, McNicholas was appointed the second Bishop of Duluth, Minnesota, by Pope Benedict XV. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 8 from Cardinal Tommaso Pio Boggiani, O.P., with Archbishop Bonaventura Cerretti and Bishop Hermann Esser, O.P., serving as co-consecrators. His installation took place in Duluth on the following November 15. He was raised to the rank of an Assistant at the Pontifical Throne in 1923. In May 1925, he was named Bishop of Indianapolis, Indiana, to succeed Bishop Joseph Chartrand, who was appointed Archbishop of Cincinnati. However, he never occupied that post due to Chartrand's rejection of his own appointment. Instead, McNicholas was appointed the fourth Archbishop of Cincinnati by Pope Pius XI on July 8, 1925. His installation took place at St. Peter in Chains Cathedral on the following August 12. During the 1928 presidential election, which featured the first Catholic to win a major party nomination in the person of Al Smith, McNicholas addressed concerns that Smith would take orders from church leaders in Rome in making decisions affecting the country by declaring, \\"We, as American Catholics, owe no civil allegiance to the Vatican State.\\" In 1931, McNicholas joined clergymen of various faiths in speaking over \\"The Church in the Air\\", a CBS radio program. However, he strongly prohibited Catholics from participating in non-Catholic religious ceremonies, saying, \\"The Catholic Church cannot give the impression that one religion is as good as another or that she must strive with those of other faiths for a common denominator in religion.\\" During the Great Depression, McNicholas advocated \\"conscription of excess wealth\\" as \\"wholly in harmony with the principles of Christian social justice\\" and named extreme concentration of wealth as one of the \\"crimes of the country\\". He also said the state could not place on charity the full burden of caring for the unemployed. In response to Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani's call for a movement to counteract the influence of \\"salacious cinema\\", McNicholas founded the Catholic Legion of Decency (later renamed the National Legion of Decency) in 1933. The organization, which at the height of its influence claimed to have more than 22,000,000 Catholic members, sought to control and enforce decency standards and boycott films deemed offensive by the Catholic Church. The film industry cooperated with the Legion and edited many films for content to avoid receiving a \\"C\\" (\\"Condemned\\") rating. While observing the conversion of a group of seventy African Americans to Roman Catholicism in Cincinnati, McNicholas said, \\"I earnestly ask all our colored citizens to consider the position of the Catholic Church, to study her teachings, to realize that her ceremonials, her processions, her music, are full of a profound meaning which, if understood, could not fail to stir the deepest emotion of the colored race.\\" In 1938, McNicholas condemned the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany and elsewhere, declaring that the German treatment of Jews \\"deserves the condemnation of all right-thinking men\\" and was \\"irrational and inhuman.\\" He also denounced the policies of the \\"madman Hitler\\" and said that there was \\"little essential difference between his brand of fascism and the Bolshevism of Stalin.\\" That same year, he issued a pastoral letter in which he wrote, \\"Governments that have no fixed standards of morality, and consequently no moral sense, can scarcely settle the question of war on moral grounds for Christians ... who see and know the injustice of practically all wars in our modern pagan world. There is the very practical question for informed Christians who acknowledge the supreme dominion of God ... Will such Christians in our country form a mighty league of conscientious non- combatants?\\" During his tenure as archbishop, McNicholas raised the level of Catholic education at all levels throughout the archdiocese and the country. He served as president-general of the National Catholic Education Association (1946-1950) and national chairman of the Catholic Student Mission Crusade and held a thirteen-year membership on the Episcopal Committee for Confraternity of Christian Doctrine. Between 1945 and 1950, he held five terms as chairman of the Administration Board of the National Catholic Welfare Conference. In 1948, Pope Pius XII wrote to McNicholas, in his capacity as NCWC chairman, a letter urging the United States to help European Displaced Persons by accepting them as immigrants. The letter, later quoted in the Church's 1952 document Exsul Familia on the rights of refugees, declares that such refugees sometimes have a right in natural law to be admitted to rich countries: \\"The sovereignty of the State, although it must be respected, cannot be exaggerated to the point that access to this land is, for inadequate or unjustified reasons, denied to needy and decent people from other nations, provided of course, that the public wealth, considered very carefully, does not forbid this.\\" In 1950, at the age of 72, McNicholas died from a heart attack at his residence in the College Hill neighborhood of Cincinnati.

History can also mean the period of time after writing was invented (the beginning of recorded history).  Nature of history  History can be described as all of the following: * Academic discipline – body of knowledge given to – or received by – a disciple (student); a branch or sphere of knowledge, or field of study, that an individual has chosen to specialise in.  one of the humanities – academic discipline that study the human condition, using methods that are primarily analytical, critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly empirical approaches of the natural sciences. * Field of science – widely recognized category of specialized expertise within science, and typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature. Such a field will usually be represented by one or more scientific journals, where peer reviewed research is published. There are many sociology-related scientific journals.  Social science – field of academic scholarship that explores aspects of human society. =Essence of history= * Chronology - science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time, such as in historical timelines. * Past - totality of events which occurred before a given point in time. The past is contrasted with and defined by the present and the future. The concept of the past is derived from the linear fashion in which human observers experience time, and is accessed through memory and recollection. The past is the domain of history. * Time - measure in which events can be ordered from the past through the present into the future, and also the measure of durations of events and the intervals between them.

Esper and Stadie also made the 1936 exploitation film Marihuana. The film, which was advertised with the tagline \\"He menaced women with his weird desires!\\", is in the public domain. A restored version was made available in 1999, as part of a double feature with another Dwain Esper film, Narcotic! (1933). John Wilson, the founder of the Golden Raspberry Award, named Maniac as one of the \\"100 Most Amusingly Bad Movies Ever Made\\" in his book The Official Razzie Movie Guide. Maniac has received negative reception since its release being the first film considered the worst movie ever made and is an oft-cited example of pornographic films.  Plot  Don Maxwell is a former vaudeville impersonator who's working as the lab assistant to Dr. Meirschultz, a mad scientist attempting to bring the dead back to life. When Don kills Meirschultz, he attempts to hide his crime by \\"becoming\\" the doctor, taking over his work, and copying his appearance/mannerisms. In the process, he slowly goes insane. The \\"doctor\\" treats a mental patient, Buckley, but accidentally injects him with adrenaline, which causes the man to go into violent fits. In one of these fits, Buckley kidnaps a woman, tears her clothes off, and rapes her. Buckley's wife discovers the body of the real doctor and blackmails Don for turning her husband into a zombie. The ersatz doctor turns the tables on her by manipulating the woman into fighting with his estranged wife, Alice Maxwell, a former showgirl. When the cat-breeding neighbor, Goof, sees what's going on, he calls the police, who stop the fight and, following the sound of Satan the cat, find the body of the real doctor hidden behind a brick wall. Cast *Bill Woods as Don Maxwell *Horace B. Carpenter as Dr. Meirschultz *Ted Edwards as Buckley *Phyllis Diller as Mrs. Buckley *Thea Ramsey as Alice Maxwell *Jenny Dark as Maizie *Marvel Andre as Marvel *Celia McCann as Jo *John P. Wade as Embalmer *Marian Blackton as Neighbor ;Cast notes *Several key cast members in the film are uncredited, most notably the cat-farming neighbor \\"Goof\\", the detective, and Maria Altura, the woman who Dr. Meirschultz brings back to life. The actress who doubled for Altura in the brief nude scene has also not been identified. *Horace B. Carpenter was a producer, director and actor from the silent era who generally portrayed whitehaired characters in Westerns once sound came in. *This is only film that Bill Woods performed in. He later became a makeup artist, working in film and television until 1968. *Marian Blackton is sometimes reported, incorrectly, as appearing in male drag as the neighbor who catches and breeds cats. She plays a female neighbor who is questioned by the detective. The male actor who plays Goof has not been identified. Blackton was the sister of Maniac's assistant director and daughter of J. Stuart Blackton, founder of Vitagraph Studios and the father of American animation. *The actress named Phyllis Diller in this film is no relation to the comedian Phyllis Diller. *Celia Jiminez, billed under her married name of Celia McCann, was also a Spanish-language voice artist, having the Spanish-language voice for Minnie Mouse and other female cartoon characters. Her daughter, also named Celia McCann, is a movie extra, and her granddaughter is comedian Julie Brown. Production Typical of the exploitation films of Dwain Esper, Maniac contains gratuitous scenes of women lounging around in their lingerie. Another poster The film was shot on a minuscule budget of $7,500, according to the son of the man who financed the production, and like many of director Dwain Esper's films was self-distributed on the exploitation roadshow circuit. After initial disappointing returns (and no reviews in the media of the time), Esper retitled the film “Sex Maniac” with great success. It became notorious for a scene in which one character strangles a cat and then eats its eyeball. The footage that is superimposed over the scenes where the actor (having shot the mad scientist) is descending into madness, while bricking his victim inside a wall, were from the 1922 Danish film Häxan. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on , with a weighted average rating of 6.8/10. Many reviewers praise it as being \\"so bad it's good\\", such as Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com, who called it \\"A true trash masterpiece.\\" Leonard Maltin awarded the film the lowest rating of BOMB, calling it \\"[a] Typically delirious Esper Schlockfest— filmed mostly in somebody's basement\\". Danny Peary believes that Maniac is the worst film ever made. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington, in a review for the 2005 Dominion film Chaos, wrote: \\"I wouldn't say Chaos is the worst movie I've ever seen. There are some voyages into ineptitude, like Dwain Esper's anti-classic Maniac, that defy all reason.\\" A Rotten Tomatoes editorial by Michael Adams placed the film on a list of 25 movies so bad they're unmissable, and the Italian Vanity Fair included it on its list of the 20 worst movies ever.

She helped him to seize power and eventually take over the throne from Sui dynasty by organizing an \\"Army of the Lady\\" (), commanded by herself, in her campaign to capture the Sui capital Chang'an. In her own way, she was the first general of the Tang dynasty.  Background  The future Princess Pingyang was the third daughter of Li Yuan, Duke of Tang, a hereditary nobleman of Sui China. She was his third daughter, but the only daughter of his wife Duchess Dou, who also bore four sons -- Li Jiancheng, Li Shimin (later Emperor Taizong), Li Xuanba, and Li Yuanji. Eventually, Li Yuan gave her in marriage to Chai Shao, the son of Chai Shen (柴慎) the Duke of Julu. She is not to be confused from another Princess Pingyang in the Western Han dynasty.  Participation in Tang's founding  In 617, Li Yuan, then the general in charge at Taiyuan was planning to rebel against Emperor Yang of Sui, by whom he had been imprisoned before. He sent messengers to his daughter and son-in-law Chai Shao, then at the Sui capital Chang'an, summoning them back to Taiyuan. Chai worried that they would not be able to escape together easily, and when he consulted her, she told him to go and that she, as a woman, would be able to hide more easily. He therefore secretly headed for Taiyuan and, after first meeting Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji, whom Li Yuan had similarly recalled from Hedong (, now part of Yuncheng, Shanxi), reported to Taiyuan. Pingyang hid initially, but then distributed her wealth to several hundred men, receiving their loyalty, so she rose in support of Li Yuan. She sent her servant Ma Sanbao (馬三寶) to persuade the agrarian rebel leader He Panren (何潘仁) to join her, and then also persuaded other rebel leaders Li Zhongwen (李仲文), Xiang Shanzhi (向善志), and Qiu Shili (丘師利) to join her as well. She attacked and captured some of the nearby cities, and she gathered a total of 70,000 men. Late in 617, Li Yuan crossed the Yellow River into the Chang'an region, and he sent Chai Shao to rendezvous with her. They then joined Li Shimin, commanding one wing of Li Yuan's army. Chai and she set up separate headquarters as commanding generals, and her army became known as the \\"Army of the Lady.\\" In 618, Li Yuan had Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You yield the throne to him, establishing the Tang dynasty as Emperor Gaozu. He created her the Princess Pingyang, and as she contributed greatly to his victory, he particularly honored her over his 18 other daughters.  Death  The Princess Pingyang, however, was not recorded as having been involved in another battle after her father's capture of Chang'an. When she died in 623, Emperor Gaozu ordered that a grand military funeral, fit for a high general, be given for her. When officials of the Ministry of Rites objected to the presence of a band, stating that women's funerals were not supposed to have bands, he responded, \\"As you know, the princess mustered an army that helped us overthrow the Sui dynasty. She participated in many battles, and her help was decisive in founding the Tang dynasty. ... She was no ordinary woman.\\"  Issue  Princess Pingyang and her husband, Chai Shao, had two sons: *Chai Zhewei 柴哲威, titled Duke of Qiao *Chai Lingwu 柴令武 (died 653), titled Duke of Xiangyang, married Emperor Taizong's daughter Princess Baling (巴陵公主) Ancestry Notes  References  * * Old Book of Tang, vol. 58 . * New Book of Tang, vol. 83 . * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 183, 184, 190.

After a two-day assault on the city's western fortifications, the Polish defences collapsed and the city was evacuated. It was the largest battle and the final episode of the Polish–Russian War of 1830–31, a conflict that became better known as the November Uprising. After almost a year of heavy fighting, a large Russian force crossed the Vistula and besieged the capital of Poland on 20 August. Although the siege was partially lifted soon afterwards and a successful sortie allowed a communication route between the city and the rest of Poland, a large Russian force remained on the left bank of the Vistula and continued to threaten the city. Russian commander Ivan Paskevich counted on Polish surrender as his Polish counterpart, Jan Krukowiecki, was known to be a member of the moderate political forces, willing to negotiate with Russian tsar Nicholas I, who had been deposed from the Polish throne in January 1831 by the Sejm (Polish parliament). When a less conciliatory faction gained power in Warsaw and the Russian offer of surrender was refused, Paskevich ordered his forces to launch an assault against Warsaw's western defences. The assault started on 6 September 1831. Russian forces surprised the Poles by attacking the strongest Polish position in the suburb of Wola. Despite staunch defence of some of the ramparts, especially Fort 54 and Fort 56, after the first day the outer line of Polish defences had been breached by Russian infantry and artillery. The following day fights resumed, but this time Russian artillery was close enough to shell the western boroughs of the city itself. Although losses were similar on both sides, Polish authorities decided not to risk another Massacre of Praga and ordered the evacuation of the city. On 8 September 1831 Warsaw lay in Russian hands, and the remainder of the Polish Army retreated to Modlin. The November Uprising ended soon afterwards, with the remnants of the Polish Army crossing the borders of Prussia and Austria, to avoid being captured by the Russians. In the 19th century the fight for Warsaw became one of the icons of Polish culture, described by, among others, Polish romantic poets Adam Mickiewicz and Juliusz Słowacki. It was also the main inspiration behind Chopin's Revolutionary Étude, initially called the Étude on the Bombardment of Warsaw. The fall of Warsaw also garnered sympathy for the Poles and their quest for independence.  Background  In 1830 a series of revolutions struck Europe: the July Revolution in France, the Belgian Revolution and smaller revolts in Italy threatened to overthrow the framework of European politics established at the Congress of Vienna. As the Russian tsars were among the strongest advocates of that status quo, the uprising in Poland and the ousting of the tsar as the king of Poland by the Sejm and Senate of Poland on 25 January 1831 were considered a serious irritant. Russia could not send its armies to Belgium or France before the rebellion in Poland was quelled. For that reason the capture of Warsaw was Russia's main target in the war from the start of hostilities. In the course of the uprising, the army of Russia unsuccessfully tried to capture the capital of Poland on two occasions. First in February 1831, forces under Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch stormed the eastern suburb of Praga. After a bloody battle at Grochów, the Polish Army successfully retreated to Warsaw, and the capital remained in Polish hands. Unable to capture Warsaw by a frontal assault, von Diebitsch devised a plan to outflank it and enter the city from the west. In early 1831 he sent his forces upstream on the Vistula, where the Russian divisions were to cross the river and head back north, towards Warsaw. The new plan was thwarted by the Polish defence in three successive battles around Wawer, Dębe Wielkie and Iganie. The Russians withdrew towards Siedlce, where von Diebitsch fell ill and died of cholera. Polish forces returning from Wierzbno, an 1831 painting by Marcin Zaleski The successor of von Diebitsch as Commander in Chief of Russian forces in Poland, Count Ivan Paskevich, decided to wait for the Polish forces on other fronts to be defeated before he resumed his march on Warsaw. In June 1831 General Antoni Giełgud's attack on Wilno failed, and his corps was forced to cross the border with Prussia to avoid complete destruction. Only a small detachment under General Henryk Dembiński managed to rejoin the main Polish force. This secured Paskevich's northern flank and allowed his forces to devise a new plan of attack. Instead of attacking the city directly and risking yet another defeat, he intended to surround Warsaw, cut it off from other Polish-controlled areas, and force it into submission. Between 17 and 21 July 1831 he crossed the Vistula near Osiek with his main force, and moved towards Warsaw through Gąbin and Łowicz. Meanwhile, other Russian forces from other theatres were also directed towards the city. General Gregor von Rosen's Corps (12,000 men and 34 guns) marched almost unopposed from Brześć Litewski and reached Praga on 10 August. General Theodor von Rüdiger's corps (12,000 men and 42 guns) crossed the Upper Vistula at Józefów on 7 August and captured Radom. The new Commander in Chief of the Polish Army, Jan Zygmunt Skrzynecki, was also hesitant to fight a major battle. Instead, he ordered Warsaw to be fortified and allowed the Russians to cross the Vistula unopposed. In his opinion, the war could only be won diplomatically, by interventions of the United Kingdom, Austria and France. Should those fail, Skrzynecki believed Warsaw would hold out at least several weeks under a siege, after which the main bulk of the Polish Army would still be intact to fight a decisive battle against the Russians, who by then would be cut off from their rear by the Vistula. On 10 August 1831 Skrzynecki was forced to resign and was replaced by Henryk Dembiński, the military governor of Warsaw.  Prelude  = Battlefield = A plan of Polish field fortifications (north is to the right) 1831 map of Warsaw, with Lubomirski Ramparts marked in red. The main line of Polish defences followed it closely. In the late 18th century and early 19th century Warsaw grew quickly. As Poland was going through a period of turmoil and constant devastating wars, it lacked modern permanent fortifications. To make up for it, three lines of earthworks, ramparts and palisades were constructed on both sides of the Vistula. The earthworks, usually several metres high and constructed mostly of sand and clay, were reinforced with gabions and surrounded by a dry moat, a stockade and a line of trous de loup. The inner, third line ran approximately along the former Lubomirski Ramparts, demolished only a couple of years before. It was a continuous line of earthworks high, strengthened by numerous forts and fortified houses. The second line of defences consisted of forts in front of the inner line of defences. The strongest forts were along the road towards Kalisz. The first, outer line of defences consisted of smaller forts and ramparts running along a semi-circular line from Szopy, through Rakowiec, Wola and Parysów to the banks of the Vistula. The fortified outposts of the outer line were in front of the third line. Their purpose was to withstand the initial attacks and divide the attacking Russian forces into smaller groups. There were five large groups of earthworks in the outer line: * Królikarnia (Forts 44 and 45) * Rakowiec (Forts 48 to 53) * Wola (Fort 56) * Parysów (Forts 61 and 62) * Marymont Forest (Fort 66) The space between the large fortifications was covered by a series of smaller redans (chevron-shaped forts) and barkans (trapezoidal forts). The strongest fortification in the outer line of defences was Fort 56 in the suburb of Wola, built around the St Lawrence's Church. It was supported by Lunette 57 in front of it, and two forts (54 and 55) to the south of it. The headquarters was in Fort 73 between Rakowiec and the Jerozolimskie Gate. Polish headquarters decided to man the outer line of defences, the furthest from the densely populated areas. The reason was that in the 1830s 53 percent of buildings (out of 3,148 houses in Warsaw) were made of wood and a fire could easily destroy the city. In case the enemy broke through all three lines of defences, the city centre was also fortified with 30 barricades, embrasures cut through the walls of several buildings and mines hidden beneath major street crossings. = Opposing forces =  Russian Army  By 20 August 1831 Warsaw was almost entirely encircled by the Russians. Count Paskevich had at his disposal a formidable force. His main force on the left bank of the Vistula consisted of between 54,000 and 55,000 soldiers, supported by 324 guns of various calibres. A further 7000 soldiers and 20 guns guarded the river crossings. The II Corps under General Cyprian von Kreutz (21,000 soldiers, 90 guns) was heading towards the city from Osiek while von Rüdiger's corps was tied down around Radom, fighting a large Polish corps under General Samuel Różycki. By 5 September 1831, the main Russian force rose to 78,500 men at arms, including 2,000 sappers, 54,000 infantry, and 17,200 cavalry. Russian artillery outnumbered the Polish and had 382 cannons and 8 mortars operated by 7,300 men. The forces assaulting Warsaw were divided as follows: * I Infantry Corps (General Peter von der Pahlen) – 11,300 infantry, 424 cavalry, 66 cannon and 4 mortars  Cavalry Division (Prince Stepan Khilkov) – 2,700 cavalry, 847 Cossacks, 10 cannon * II Infantry Corps (General Cyprian Kreutz) – 11,200 infantry, 1110 cavalry, 68 cannon and 4 mortars  Cavalry Division (General Georg Nostitz) – 2,100 cavalry, 16 cannon  Infantry Division (General Nikolai Muraviev) – 3,100 infantry, 16 cannon * Corps of Imperial Guard (in reserve, Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich) – 15,700 infantry, 56 cannon  Grenadier Corps (General Ivan Shakhovskoy) – 11,000 infantry, 40 cannon  Cavalry Corps (General Jan de Witte) – 8,500 cavalry, 40 cannon  artillery reserve – 60 cannon * 2nd Light Division (General Karl Gustav von Strandmann) – 1,400 infantry, 484 cavalry, 875 Cossacks and 6 cannons The Russian force was superior, but faced severe logistical problems. Count Paskevich's army was too big to sustain on food confiscated from captured lands. It relied on provisions transported from Russia, either directly through Polish territory or theoretically neutral Prussia. The epidemic of cholera brought to Poland and East Prussia by Russian soldiers forced the Prussian authorities to close their borders to Russian transports. To avoid starving his army, Paskevich ordered two permanent bridges built across the Vistula, in Góra and Podgórze. Only the latter one had been completed by the start of the Russian assault of Warsaw.  Polish Army  The Polish Army in early September 1831 had around 62,000 men. The garrison of Warsaw numbered 31,100 infantry and 3,800 cavalry. It was divided into the following units: * I Corps (General Jan Nepomucen Umiński) – 18,100 infantry, 1,400 cavalry, 34 guns * Reserve Corps (General Henryk Dembiński) – 11,500 infantry, 1,700 cavalry, 12 guns * Garrison of Warsaw and Praga – 1,361 infantry, 524 cavalry The artillery included 228 pieces of artillery of all types and 21 Congreve rocket batteries, manned by 4554 soldiers of the regular army and 200 members of the National Guard. Jewish Security Guard, an 1831 engraving by Fryderyk Krzysztof Dietrich The crew was insufficient to man all the defences, and some forts had to be abandoned. The Engineering Committee predicted that Warsaw's fortifications would require at least 60,000 troops to be fully manned. There were 15,000 able-bodied members of the Security Guard (), the National Guard () and the Jewish City Guard () militias willing to join the fight, but the army refused to provide them with arms for fear of losing control over the unruly plebeians. The city was home to over 175,000 civilians and refugees, and the defenders were low on food supplies. Ammunition supplies were excellent and would \\"allow the Polish Army to fight not one, but three major battles\\". The Warsaw Arsenal alone stored 3 million rounds of ammunition and 60,000 cannonballs, 200 shots per cannon. The cholera epidemic struck Warsaw between 16 May and 20 August; 4,734 people fell ill and 2,524 died. On 15 August a riot broke out in the city, with up to 3,000 civilians and soldiers killing suspected spies and traitors. Between 36 and 60 people were killed. Order was restored, but the situation in the besieged city remained fragile.  Training, equipment and morale  Both sides were trained in a similar manner and used similar equipment. The standard rifle for both sides was the Model 1808 flintlock musket (a copy of the Charleville musket) and its modification, the Model 1826 Musket, with effective range not exceeding . Some units of the Polish infantry were still armed with hunting rifles or war scythes, but contrary to common misconception the scythe-wielding kosynierzy were but a small minority of Polish forces. The artillery used by both sides was mostly six-pounder and twelve-pounder licornes; heavier artillery included twenty-pounders (\\"half-pood\\") and 10-pounders (\\"quarter-pood\\") cannons. Apart from Russian-made artillery, both sides also used to a lesser extent foreign guns. The forces of both sides were a mixture of old, battle-hardened soldiers trained in regular units before the war, and new, unproven recruits. Polish General Staff wore navy blue uniforms reminiscent of Napoleonic-era attire. Soldiers of each regiment wore uniforms in colours of their land. The Polish Army was made up primarily of volunteers and organised along the lines of Napoleon Bonaparte's army, which meant that there was no corporal punishment in the military handbooks and the soldiers were highly motivated. The good morale of the first months of the uprising was long gone by the early days of September. A long string of defeats, partial victories, and retreats coupled with high command's indecisiveness and frequent changes in command structure (between 12 and 20 August the post of Commander-in-Chief changed hands four times) meant that the soldiers' morale was low. Also, most of the generals in Warsaw lacked faith in the aims of the uprising set by the more liberal-minded members of Sejm and instead were \\"only doing their job\\", hoping the status quo would return as soon as the tsar was forced to stand by his promises. The generals supporting continued fighting (Jan Nepomucen Umiński, Henryk Dembiński, Józef Bem, and Kazimierz Małachowski) were in charge in early September, but they were outnumbered by generals who were willing to sign an armistice with the Russians, even against the will of the Sejm. By contrast the Russian forces' morale was extremely high. The Russian commanders had ample experience in siege operations; Paskevich himself had captured at least six fortified cities in his career, including the capture of Erevan and Abbas- Abbad Fortress in the Russo-Persian War of 1826 and the battle of Akhalzic and siege of Kars during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828.  Battle  = Initial clashes = Facing logistical problems, the new Polish Commander-in-Chief Jan Krukowiecki, who had replaced Dembiński in mid-August, ordered a sortie on the right bank. Like his predecessor, Krukowiecki was a conservative and believed the main aim of the November Uprising was the return of the status quo ante with the tsars of Russia as kings of Poland, but respecting the constitution and Polish laws. Unlike Skrzynecki, he believed foreign intervention to be unrealistic, and wanted to force the Russians to return to peace talks by defeating the Russian forces, breaking the siege or defeating the assault attempts. Pontoon bridge over the Vistula on an 1831 painting by Marcin Zaleski According to the new strategy, the forces under Girolamo Ramorino and Tomasz Łubieński were to leave the city and stay on the right bank of the Vistula, harass the Russian forces under von Rosen and von Rüdiger, capture the river crossings at Osiek, provide the city with supplies, and force Paskevich to divert some of his forces to fight them. Both forces left the city between 16 and 20 August 1831. Tomasz Łubieński's Corps headed towards Płock, broke the encirclement, and delivered much-needed supplies to Warsaw. His forces also broke the northern line of communications between Paskevich's forces and East Prussia. Girolamo Ramorino's II Corps in Podlasie defeated von Rosen's Corps in several clashes, including the battles of Międzyrzec and Rogoźnica. Ramorino's indecisiveness and disregard for orders allowed the defeated and numerically inferior Russians to retreat towards Brześć Litewski and avoid complete destruction. The departure of regular units under Ramorino and Łubieński depleted the forces of the defenders, further weakening the crew manning the first line of defence. The garrison dropped to 28,000 regular soldiers and 10,000 fresh troops, poorly trained and often armed only with scythes. Having defeated von Rosen at Międzyrzec on 29 August, Ramorino's forces were ordered to return to Siedlce, but Ramorino disregarded that order and followed von Rosen towards Brześć. The order to return through Łuków to Siedlce was repeated on 4 September. From there, a forced march could allow the II Corps to cross the Vistula to the south of Warsaw and attack Paskevich from the rear, or rejoin the bulk of the Polish Army defending Warsaw. The repeated order was also ignored. A large part of the Polish forces, composed mostly of seasoned soldiers, high in morale thanks to recent victories, was wandering aimlessly through Podlasie, only a couple of days' march from Warsaw. Instead of coming to the aid of Warsaw or following the fleeing forces of von Rosen, Ramorino waited in Podlasie for a week, and then headed south, away from the enemy. On 4 September Paskevich sent an envoy to Warsaw requesting surrender and promising revision of the constitution. Only three out of ten members of the Diplomatic Commission voted in favour of further negotiations, and on 5 September the Russian commander was informed that the only acceptable solution had already been made known in the declaration of the Sejm. The Poles requested that all lands taken by Russia in the partitions of Poland be restored, and that the deposition of Nicholas I as the king of Poland (of 25 January 1831) still be valid. On the eve of the battle, the Russian Army moved from its positions in villages surrounding Warsaw, (Nadarzyn, Wolica, Falenty, Dawidy and Raszyn) closer to Polish positions. The Guards started moving towards Opacze Wielkie. The grenadiers, Cavalry Corps and the I Infantry Corps moved to the road to Kalisz near Szamoty, and the II Infantry Corps moved to Włochy. An infantry division under Muraviev occupied the fields between Okęcie and Rakowiec, and Cavalry Division of Nostitz moved to Zbarż. To complete the encirclement, the 2nd Light Division under von Strandmann took positions near Służew on the road towards Lublin, while Stepan Khilkov's Cavalry Division moved to Chrzanów. The supply trains and reserves were left in Nadarzyn. = Battle plans = Poles fortify Warsaw, their capital, a 19th-century steel engraving published in Germany Although initially Paskevich opposed the idea of an all-out assault of the city, the actions of Ramorino and Łubieński forced his hand. His force was low on provisions and supplies: by early September the main Russian force had only 5 days' worth of food and horse fodder. On 28 August Paskevich accepted some of his generals' advice, and ordered preparations for a general attack. After several days of quarrels within the Russian staff, it was decided on 4 September that the main thrust should be aimed at the strongest Polish positions behind the suburb of Wola. The assault was to focus on the central rampart in Wola, Fort 56, and the surrounding fortifications. The Russian I Infantry Corps was to storm Fort 57 and continue towards Forts 56 and 58. The II Infantry Corps was to focus on nearby Forts 54 and 55. Other sectors of the front were to be only lightly pressed by diversionary attacks. Paskevich probably did not want to enter Warsaw, and counted on the Polish defenders to abandon the city or surrender once the outer ring of defences was pierced and the city centre was threatened with fire. The Polish plan was based on fixed defence of the front line, with the forces under Umiński and Dembiński behind the second line of defences and acting as a mobile reserve, together with divisional artillery and cavalry. Umiński's Corps was to cover the southern sector of the front, a line of approximately from road to Puławy, through the road towards Kraków, to the line connecting Fort 18 and Fort 74. Forces under Dembiński were to defend the western and northern sector, along a line of running from Redoubt 54 to the suburb of Marymont. Most of the Polish forces were in the southern part of the city, as the Polish headquarters incorrectly assumed that the Russians would attack the weakest part of the defences, around Królikarnia, the suburbs of Mokotów and Czerniaków. = 6 September = Already before the battle Paskevich achieved devastating numerical superiority on the western front. The first Russian line facing Wola had 30,200 soldiers, 144 pieces of artillery and eight mortars; the second line was formed by 39,200 soldiers and 196 pieces of artillery. Facing them were 5,300 infantry, 65 cannons and 1,100 cavalry under Dembiński, with another 4,800 soldiers in reserve. The ramparts of Warsaw were over high and were reinforced with stockades, dry moats, spike pits and other obstacles. Houses near the forts were also fortified. At 2:00 Polish observation posts on the Holy Trinity Church and the Astronomical Observatory at Ujazdów Avenue spotted enemy movements and sounded the alarm. The attack started around 4:00, and within an hour Polish forts 54 and 57 opened fire on approaching Russians. Around 5:00, eighty-six guns of the I Infantry Corps started shelling Polish positions around Wola from a distance of , and the battle started. Fort 56 consisted of three wings, each surrounded by its own earthwork, stockades and a moat. Partially obscured by the trees of Brühl's Garden, the central wing was further reinforced by the St. Laurence's Church and the surrounding monastery. The fort, commanded by General Józef Sowiński, was manned by two battalions of the 8th Regiment of Line Infantry (1,200 men), with 40 sappers, 13 cannon, two Congreve rocket launchers, and a small detachment from the 14th Regiment of Line Infantry (170 men). Directly in front of it, on a hill overlooking the battlefield, lay the smaller, irregularly-shaped Fort 57 manned by 300 men under Maj. Józef Krassowski, armed with four pieces of artillery and two Congreve rocket launchers. To the north lay Fort 59 (four cannon and 400 men under Maj. Józef Borzęcki), while to the south Fort 54 (up to 350 men under Maj. Ignacy Dobrzelewski and six guns under Lt. Julian Konstanty Ordon). Even though the remaining forts of Wola (Forts 55, 58, 60 and 61) were deprived of their garrisons to strengthen the defence, the most important Polish positions were still severely undermanned. Further to the south, near Rakowiec, lay a group of forts of the outer line. All had already been abandoned by the Poles in early September, and were captured by Russian infantry under General Muraviev without a fight. Forces under General von Strandmann captured Szopy and started attacking Forts 44, 45 and the fortifications around Królikarnia. Although von Strandmann's unit did not have a clear numerical superiority (2,900 Russians with six guns against 1,700 Poles with six guns), they quickly pushed back the Polish defenders. Soon dense black powder smoke covered the battlefield. Unable to determine the direction of Russian attacks, the Polish commanders believed that the aim of the main thrust would be delivered against the positions at Królikarnia. The first to realise the mistake was General Dembiński, the commanding officer of the Reserve Corps tasked with defending the western sector. He immediately asked for reinforcements, but was denied by General Krukowiecki. Forced to fight alone, Dembiński did not reinforce the first line with his reserve 3rd Infantry Division and instead sent forward only a token force: half a battalion to man Fort 58 and support Fort 57. To make things worse for the Poles, General Umiński, the commanding officer of the southern sector, focused entirely on the skirmishes around Królikarnia and did not notice what was happening in Wola. Around 7:00 he reinforced Królikarnia with almost six battalions of infantry (ca. 2,800 men) and three guns. Forts 54 and 55 received no reinforcements.  Fort 54  Meanwhile, the outer earthworks protecting the forts around Wola were being destroyed by Russian artillery. From 6:00, 108 pieces of Russian artillery were focused on forts 54, 55 and 57. Fort 54 held out and losses among the infantry were low, but the artillery of the isolated outposts was forced to hide behind the ramparts. Forts 59 and 61 could not support their neighbours as their crews fought their own artillery duel with horse artillery of Khilkov's Cavalry Division, which suffered heavy casualties. Soldiers of Polish regiments formed before the outbreak of hostilities (1st through 8th Regiments of Line Infantry) wore navy blue uniforms with white trousers and yellow collars and details. Out of 32 pieces of artillery held in reserve by Dembiński, only four were moved forward to Fort 58. Around 6:30, nine more guns joined the artillery duel around Wola, but their support was too weak and came too late. At that time two large assault columns were formed by Russian II Infantry Corps. The first, under General Nikolai Sulima, advanced on Fort 54 with Lutkovski's Brigade (2,500 men) in the first line. The second, commanded by General Friedrich Caspar von Geismar, headed for Fort 55. As soon as von Geismar realised that the redoubt was empty, he ordered 1,500 men under Col. Pavel Liprandi to join the attack on Fort 54 instead. Despite serious losses, three battalions of Lutkovski's Brigade reached the stockade surrounding the earthworks and started clearing obstacles. Because of the smoke the commanders of the second line of Polish outposts could not see the approaching Russians and did not open fire. Contrary to the battle plan, the second line did not send reinforcements to the first. This was particularly important in the case of Forts 54 and 56, as they had to face the enemy alone, without the support of Forts 21, 22 and 23 behind them. The most important positions in the suburb of Wola received only token reinforcements from the main reserve and were forced to fight in isolation. The Polish defenders of Fort 54 fired incessantly, but by then the Russian horse artillery had clear line of sight onto the top of the rampart. For unknown reasons the Poles did not use the grenades prepared for defence in close quarters. When the breach was completed, two Russian regiments (13th 'Belozerskiy' and 14th 'Olonetskiy') charged into the gap. Other Russian soldiers stormed the earthwork itself, using bayonets as steps to climb onto the parapet. After several salvoes, Polish infantry retreated to within the fort, to fire at Russian soldiers appearing on top of the rampart. The first to cross the obstacles was Pavel Liprandi with his men. With 10:1 Russian superiority, the bayonet fight was short, and between 60 and 80 surviving Poles were taken prisoner in a matter of minutes. Soon afterwards the gunpowder magazine was set on fire and exploded, killing over 100 Russians, among them the commanding officer of the 13th Regiment, Col. Ivan Khludenev. The explosion was fictionalised and immortalised in Adam Mickiewicz's poem Reduta Ordona (Ordon's Redoubt). Altogether the Russian losses during the storming of Fort 54 were between 500 and 600 killed. The dead were buried in a mass grave in a shell-hole, which later became the nucleus of the Orthodox Cemetery in Warsaw. Expecting a Polish counter-attack, Russian engineers started to repair Forts 54 and 55. Initially only Polish artillery from forts 73, 21, 22 and 23 responded with fire, while Dembiński's reserves remained passive. Seeing no activity on Polish side, Russian II Infantry Corps' artillery started supporting its neighbours of the I Infantry Corps. Russian artillery suffered some losses, but its superiority was evident. Batteries of the I Corps approached Fort 57 to within , which forced the Polish artillery to be dismantled and withdrawn from the fort. Around 8:00 two columns of the I Corps (under Alexander von Lüders and Ivan Nabokov) assaulted the fort. Elements of four Russian regiments (3rd and 4th Marine Regiments, 7th 'Revelski' Infantry Regiment and Moskovsky Regiment) stormed the fort from three sides, hoping a three-hour artillery barrage had destroyed the obstacles and palisade guarding the entry to Polish positions. The stockade was almost intact and Russian forces suffered considerable losses, both from small-arms fire and from artillery of the 2nd line. The officers ordered a retreat, but the soldiers disregarded the order and continued to assault the fort on their own. Several assaults were repelled with heavy Russian losses. Despite the losses, Russian infantry entered the fort and captured it in a close quarters fight, without a shot fired. Only about 80 Poles were taken captive, and four managed to retreat to the Polish lines with their wounded commanding officer; the remainder fought on and were killed almost to the last man. As the recently captured fort was well within the range of Polish artillery, the Russians withdrew and started hiding behind it. Fort 56 Paskevich commanding the forces to attack Redoubt 56, a bas-relief scene from Warsaw's monument to Paskevich Despite the loss of forts 54, 55 and 57, Krukowiecki was still convinced that the attack on Wola was a diversion, and refused to grant General Dembiński more reinforcements. Only General Ludwik Bogusławski, commanding officer of the 3rd Infantry Division, disregarded his orders and sent a single battalion of the 10th Line Infantry Regiment to Fort 56 as reinforcements. The battalion was led by Col. Piotr Wysocki, the officer who started the entire November Uprising. Dembiński abandoned Fort 58. Its artillery, along with 12 cannons and six rocket launchers from his reserves, was ordered to take positions between the first and second lines of defence, in front of Forts 21, 22 and 23. Around 9:00, when Russian forces were preparing to push further into the second line of Polish defences, Brigadier Józef Bem arrived to Wola with his 12 cannon and positioned them not far from the recently-lost Fort 54, right on the flank of Kreutz's infantry and Russian artillery shelling Fort 56. Eight more guns and four rocket launchers arrived to the northern flank of Wola and joined the defence of Fort 58. Around that time the combined artillery forces of both Russian infantry corps shifted their fire to Forts 56, 59 and 23. This time the Poles won the artillery duel. Despite Russian numerical superiority in guns and mortars, the Russian artillery suffered losses and was forced to withdraw, followed by infantry, likewise forced back into hiding behind the captured earthworks. Dembiński did not take advantage of this success, and the Polish infantry remained hidden behind fixed defences. Seeing no activity, the commander of the Russian II Corps ordered all his cannons to shift fire onto the 14 guns under Józef Bem. Heavily pressed, Polish artillery withstood the fire for over half an hour before switching to new positions to the right of the road to Kalisz. It resumed fire on the II Corps, but was again targeted by enemy guns. The artillery duel continued, but the situation of Fort 56 was becoming critical. Shelled from three sides, the largest Polish fort around Warsaw was now isolated. Including reinforcements brought by Col. Wysocki, the crew of the fort included approximately 1,660 infantrymen and ten pieces of artillery. By 10:00 most artillerymen had been killed or wounded (including the fort's artillery commander, Capt. Krzywicki) and had to be replaced with untrained infantrymen, which seriously limited the Polish guns' rate of fire and accuracy. All ramparts were successively damaged by Russian artillery, and there was a 30-metre breach in one of its sides. Paskevich, who observed the artillery duel from Fort 55, became convinced that his Polish counterpart would not come to the rescue of Fort 56. Initially hesitant, he finally ordered Russian infantry to attack Fort 56 around 10:00. The attack was carried out by 13 infantry battalions (ca. 6,900 men) from columns commanded by General Lüders and Martinov. The forces of Lüders stormed the obstacles and crossed the stockade, but Polish defenders met them with rifle volleys from within the fort, and the attack was repelled. Lüders quickly ordered his second line (2,300 men) to advance as well. The new forces were twice pushed back into the moat by the commander of the northern wing, Maj. Franciszek Biernacki, but in the end the Polish defenders were overpowered and had to withdraw further into the fort. The Russians followed, but their battalions lost cohesion, which allowed the numerically inferior force under Biernacki to hold out inside the fort and cover the flank of the central wing. Forces under General Martinov assaulted the central wing of Fort 56. Here the obstacles were intact, and 200 Polish soldiers repelled three consecutive assaults by a famed Moscow Guards Regiment. The Russians lost two regimental commanders before their forces managed to reach the moat. When a force of 2,900 Russians reached the top of the rampart, they were surprised by a staunch defence of a second rampart behind it. Russian infantry retreated and hid under the first rampart. Biernacki, fighting in the northern wing, managed to expel the Russian infantry, but was killed in action during the counter-attack, and the Poles withdrew back into the trees on the far side of the fort. To stabilise the situation, General Sowiński ordered a company of the 8th Line Infantry Regiment to leave the central wing and join the fight in the north. The new commanding officer of the north wing, Maj. Lipski, organised yet another counter-attack. Shouting \\"Mates, remember Grochów, remember Iganie!\\" he led his men in a charge and pushed the Russians back once again, but the impetus was lost and the Russians retained control of the rampart to the north-west. A short stalemate ensued, in which the Polish infantrymen and their single twelve-pounder carronade prevented much larger enemy forces from entering the fort. Sowiński on the Ramparts of Wola, a painting by Wojciech Kossak \\"Death of General Sowiński\\", a contemporary engraving by Gustave Janet-Lange Seeing that their forces had failed, Paskevich and Pahlen decided to throw in even more forces into the fight. Elements of the 9th 'Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment and 10th 'New Ingermanland' Infantry Regiment (890 men and six guns) were ordered to attack the eastern side of the northern wing. Simultaneously seven battalions (ca. 4,000 men) were to attack the central and eastern wings from the south. About 70 pieces of artillery were ordered to fire on the second line of Polish defences to prevent Polish reinforcements from breaking through to the fort. This time several thousand Russians entered the northern wing in strict military formations. By then the garrison under Maj. Lipski had 800 men and was not strong enough to withstand the assault. Poles were again pushed back into the trees of the far side of the northern wing, and Maj. Lipski was killed. He was replaced by Maj. Dobrogoyski, who panicked and sounded a retreat, taking with him 500 men. The remaining 300 soldiers under Maj. Świtkowski tried again to force the Russians out, but were by then outnumbered 10 to 1 and around 10:30 had to withdraw towards the central wing. The central wing, by then under the command of Lt. Col. Wodzyński, held out against a large column led by General Lüders, composed of the elite regiments of Prince Wilhelm and Prince Charles. General Sowiński's pegleg is preserved in the Museum of the Polish Army. By that time the central wing was defended by a mere 900 men and one cannon. The combined forces of Lüders, Martynov and Friedrich von Berg exceeded 6,000 men and were preparing to storm it. Several assaults were repelled, but shortly after 11:00 the Polish position was attacked from the north and south simultaneously. The northern pincer stalled and the southern pincer, led by General Malinovski, was bloodily repelled. General Martynov was badly wounded. General Pahlen ordered a further 2,300 men (5th Infantry Regiment and elements of Siberian Grenadiers) to attack from the other side. The Siberian regiment entered the fort and forced the crews of carronades, commanded personally by General Sowiński, to withdraw within the walls surrounding the church. The largest group of Polish soldiers fighting in front of the church was offered capitulation, and Sowiński and the remainder of his crew laid down their arms. Another group of Polish soldiers still defending the church fired at the Russians, and angered Russian soldiers, General Sowiński among them, massacred the prisoners of war. As Russian authorities later confirmed he died on the field of duty, Sowiński soon became a Polish national hero, immortalised in a poem \\"Sowiński w okopach Woli\\" (Sowiński in the trenches of Wola) by Juliusz Słowacki. The surrounded church was well prepared for defence, but its garrison was by then composed almost entirely of the wounded. By noon the defenders were overpowered, and the Russians entered the church. The fight for Fort 56 was over. Altogether the Russian side lost no less than 1,000 killed in action during the storming of the fort. Polish casualties did not exceed 300 killed and wounded, with 1,230 soldiers and officers taken prisoner. Only up to 500 soldiers managed to withdraw and reach Polish lines. Fights for Wola and elsewhere During the fights for the ramparts of Wola, only artillery of the second line gave limited support to the outnumbered Polish troops. Krukowiecki claimed after the war that he ordered Dembiński, Bem and General Franciszek Młokosiewicz to support the first line, but apparently none of them received the order. General Ludwik Bogusławski, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division manning the second line, could have supported the forts of the first line, but he could not see what was happening in Fort 56 due to dense smoke and the trees of Brühl's Garden. Paskevich expected a Polish counter-attack aimed at recapturing the lost forts, so he ordered his troops to halt the advance, rebuild the ramparts and construct new artillery emplacements facing the city. Further movement in the vicinity of Wola was blocked by Polish artillery from Fort 59, but within two hours Russian sappers prepared Fort 56 to serve as an artillery outpost for up to 20 pieces of artillery. Paskevich also sent tirailleurs and rifle-armed skirmishers forward to probe and harass Polish defences around Fort 23. Polish field artillery left Fort 21 and pushed back the Russian light infantry, but were then attacked by Russian I Corps' artillery and forced to flee. Only then did General Bogusławski realise that Fort 56 might need assistance. To reconnoitre enemy movements and possibly deliver munitions to the fort he dispatched General Młokosiewicz with his infantry brigade of 1,000 men. Two Russian rifle regiments fled before his columns and Młokosiewicz's men almost reached the fort, but Russian artillery opened fire and inflicted several dozen casualties on the Poles. Młokosiewicz realised that Fort 56 was lost and quickly retreated towards Forts 21 and 22. Two Russian rifle regiments (1st and 2nd) tried to pursue, but were defeated by Polish artillery and retreated. Unexpectedly, this weak push by Młokosiewicz and his men probably forced the Russians to reconsider their plans and postpone any further attacks until the following day. At that moment Paskevich was not sure what the Poles would do. He feared a Polish counter- attack would retake the forts of Wola, or strike a wedge between his I and II Corps. He ordered all offensive actions in Wola halted. His artillery continued to duel with the Poles, but infantry was withdrawn and Paskevich himself left his forces to look for the Corps of General Muraviev to the south, somewhere between Szczęśliwice and the Jerozolimskie Gate. Around that time General Małachowski arrived at Fort 23 to inspect the part of the front he had neglected until that point. Informed by General Młokosiewicz of the loss of Fort 56, he ordered a counter-attack. More preoccupied with holding the second line than with retaking the first, he committed only two battalions (1,240 men) out of 12 he had in reserve to the assault. The counter-attack started around 13:00 and was supported by a token force of 14 pieces of horse artillery, while General Bem held 21 heavier field cannons in reserve. As soon as the Poles left their ramparts, the sortie came under fire of Russian artillery amassed in front of forts 54, 55 and 56. Despite heavy fire, the Poles reached a point south-east of Fort 56, where they were met by elements of two Russian rifle regiments (1st and 2nd; ca. 1,800 men). Despite Russian numerical superiority, the Polish force broke through and pushed the Russians back, but was then defeated by Russian artillery on the eastern rampart of Fort 56. When Russian reinforcements appeared on both his flanks, the Polish commander sounded retreat and returned to the Polish lines. The Polish counter-attack failed. To make the situation even more serious, the retreating Poles were followed closely by a large Russian force of the two rifle regiments, reinforced with elements of 1st, 2nd and 5th Infantry Divisions. The Russians assaulted the second Polish line and pierced it in numerous places. The position of Russian infantry was very difficult because it overtook the 14 Polish guns sent forward by General Bem to support the Polish counter-attack, which meant that it was under artillery fire from the front, the sides and the rear. Eventually a counter-attack by the 4th Line Infantry Regiment under Lt. Col. Kazimierz Majewski repelled the Russians storming the Polish lines. Several smaller Russian units broke through and tried to fortify a group of wooden houses in the suburb of Wola, but were quickly surrounded and killed. At that point, around 13:00, Małachowski wanted to organise yet another counter-attack aimed at Fort 56, but his orders were overridden by Krukowiecki, who feared that the Russians might want to attack further south, near Jerozolimskie Gate, and preferred to keep his reserves intact. The Polish side ceased all offensive actions on the western front, and only the artillery remained active. Artillery duel continues Between 13:00 and 14:00 General Bem amassed at least 64 artillery pieces on a narrow front near Forts 21, 22 and 23, and started firing on the artillery and infantry of the I Russian Corps. In the artillery barrage that lasted until 17:00, the forces of Russian I and II Corps were eventually forced to withdraw behind the ramparts of the captured forts. On several occasions the Russian cavalry of General Khilkov (including the Cuirassier Regiment) tried to charge the Polish artillery positions, but every time the charge was bloodily repelled with grapeshot and canister shot. Eventually the Russian cavalry withdrew from battle all the way to Górce. Half of the Russian artillery fought an intense artillery duel with the Poles, while the other half started shelling the suburb of Wola and Polish positions behind the second line of defences. Although the barrage prepared the field for yet another Polish counter-attack, Krukowiecki would not risk it. Paskevich held a war council with his generals. Karl Wilhelm von Toll and many other generals insisted that the assault on Wola be resumed, but Paskevich was sceptical. The Russians still had 25,000 fresh troops, but the dusk was nearing, and Paskevich feared that after dark his forces might lose cohesion and suffer excessive losses. The Russian commander also thought that an attack on Wola might be hampered by positions of the first line still held by the Poles (Forts 58, 59 and 60; in reality Fort 58 had been abandoned), or by a Polish counter-attack from the area of Czyste. He decided to postpone offensive actions until the following day. Paskevich also sent another envoy to Warsaw, but the hastily called session of the Sejm renounced his offer of a cease-fire. By that point the battle plan of the Russians was still not clear to the Polish Commander-in-Chief General Krukowiecki. Unsure whether the main attack was on Wola or the forts around Królikarnia, he did not reassign any sizable infantry force to the western front, despite the fact that the southern line was safely in Polish hands and repeated Russian attacks there were being repelled one by one. Out of 3,000 casualties suffered by the Polish side on the first day only approximately 300 were in the southern sector near Królikarnia, including at most \\"several dozen killed\\". Yet only a small detachment of horse artillery was dispatched to the second line near Wola. In the evening General Krukowiecki called a meeting of the government and described the situation of his forces as extremely difficult. He suggested that talks with Paskevich be resumed and sent General Prądzyński to Paskevich's camp. = 7 September =  First round of negotiations  Officer and soldiers of the Russian Volhynian Guard Regiment The two met at the outskirts of Wola in the early hours of 7 September. Paskevich proclaimed a cease-fire and invited Krukowiecki to meet him at 9:00. The meeting was held in the village tavern of Wola. Paskevich demanded that Warsaw and Praga be surrendered unconditionally and that the Polish Army be evacuated and disarmed in Płock, where it was to await the decision of the tsar either to pardon the Polish soldiers or imprison them as rebels. Krukowiecki declined and insisted that the uprising was not a rebellion but a war waged by two independent states. He wanted Paskevich and Grand Duke Michael to promise the return of Poland's independence and a general amnesty in exchange for revoking the act of deposition of Nicholas from the Polish throne. The negotiations were stormy and around noon the Polish commander departed for Warsaw to consult the Sejm about further actions. Paskevich agreed to extend the cease-fire to 13:00, and to continue negotiations even if warfare was resumed. To gain support of the parliament, Krukowiecki asked General Prądzyński to represent him during the joint session of the Sejm and Senate. His political plan was to end the uprising at all costs and return to status quo ante, with himself as the \\"saviour of the fatherland\\" who stopped further bloodshed. In his speech Prądzyński seriously inflated the Russian force, and also underestimated the strength of the Polish units. He also warned that the city's inhabitants would be massacred as in 1794 should fighting continue, and stated that the return to full independence under the sceptre of Nicholas was easily achievable, something he knew for sure was not true. He failed to convince his government and the Sejm that surrender was the only option, and a heated debate extended past the deadline of 13:00. The Russians resumed hostilities, and artillery from both sides started yet another duel.  Operational situation  Both sides suffered similar casualties during the previous day. Russian victories gave their artillery a clear line of fire into the suburbs of Czyste and Wola. They also strengthened the morale of Russian soldiers, who were convinced that the battle was over once Fort 54 fell. The battle was far from lost for the Polish side though: although the Russians could now attack the third line of Polish defences in Wola (Forts 23 and 24) or Czyste (Forts 20–22), their attacks could easily be flanked by forts of the second line still in Polish hands. Also, in order to support the advance with artillery, the Russian guns would have to be stationed in open field. The Polish plans for the battle remained unchanged. Fort 59 was evacuated and Polish positions around Czyste and close to Jerozolimskie Gate were slightly reinforced, yet Polish forces remained almost equally split between the western and southern sectors. Unknown to the Poles, Russian orders for 7 September were not changed either. The II Infantry Corps was to attack the group of forts at Czyste (21 and 22), while the I Infantry Corps assaulted further north (Forts 23 and 24). Muraviev's forces were to attack the Jerozolimskie Gate, while the remaining forces continued with their diversionary attacks of the previous day. When artillery fire was restarted around 13:30, the Russian soldiers were not yet ready for the attack. The previous night had been very cold, and most Russian soldiers had no winter garments and spent the night in open field. Many did not receive any food in the morning, and the morale dropped significantly. When the Russians started to sort their ranks, General Umiński correctly assumed that the main attack in his sector would be aimed at the Jerozolimskie Gate. He reinforced the area with his reserves, including almost the entire 4th Infantry Division and 2nd Cavalry Division. He also dispatched the 1st Cavalry Division (1,300 men) closer to Czyste. Generals Małachowski and Dembiński intended to attack the flank of the Russians assaulting Wola with a strong force (3,500 infantry, 800 cavalry and 10 pieces of horse artillery) under General Paweł Muchowski gathered in Młociny (near Fort 62a). Once it became clear that the Russians would attack further south, the plan was called off and the western sector returned to fixed defences.  Grand Battery  Around 13:30, 132 Russian cannons and four mortars, including 94 guns of the Grand Battery under Prince Mikhail Dmitrievich Gorchakov, opened fire on Polish positions. The Poles initially responded with 79 field artillery pieces and 10 rocket launchers, but by 14:00 General Bem moved another 31 guns to a position right in front of the Russian artillery. To counter the threat, the Russian General von Toll ordered his Grand Battery to advance closer to the Poles. This exposed his flank to Polish guns hidden to the south, near the road to Kraków. The Russians suffered casualties, and the Grand Battery had to be split into two separate units. To make matters worse for the Russians, many batteries had to cease fire and withdraw due to insufficient ammunition reserves. Seeing that the artillery would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised a new plan of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As there was no time for proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, even if it meant increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.  Muraviev's assault and retreat  Russian hussars charging towards Warsaw (7 September 1831), painting by Mikhail Lermontov Around 15:00, masses of Russian troops started preparations for the assault on Polish positions near the Jerozolimskie Gate. A strong force under Muraviev and Nostitz occupied positions on both sides of the road towards Cracow, near Rakowiec. The screening force included the Grenadier Brigade (ca. 1700 infantry, 16 guns), Cuirasseur Brigade (ca. 1,300 cavalry, 16 guns), Guard Uhlans Regiment (392 cavalry) and three cavalry regiments (ca. 1,700 cavalry, 16 guns). Between the screening forces two columns were formed. The left column commanded by Col. Nikolai Lukash was composed of Lutsk and Samogitian Infantry Regiments (1989 men altogether), with the Finland Guard Regiment in reserve (1,374 men). The column was to storm the Fort 74. The right column was commanded by Col. Roth and was composed of a reinforced Nieśwież Infantry Regiment (1278 men), with the 4th Jäger Regiment (900 men), Guards Rifle Regiment (1,353 men) and the Finland Rifles (142 men) in reserve. This column was to assault Fort 72. On the southern front the forces of Strandmann were to attack in force towards Królikarnia and elsewhere, to pressure the Poles on more than one front. The assault started around 16:00. The left column suffered significant casualties, but reached Fort 74, only to be met by Polish reinforcements dispatched by General Antoni Wroniecki, the commanding officer of this sector. Two thousand Russians clashed with less than 850 Poles inside the fort, but were defeated in a bayonet charge and had to retreat. As the attack failed and the Polish artillery batteries were still active, von Toll decided to use his cavalry reserves. Two regiments of the 3rd Cuirassier Division (1,200 cavalry) followed a road linking Szczęśliwice and Czyste, and were ordered to charge the Polish artillery from behind. The Poles had full visibility of the battlefield and had enough time to prepare for the attack, as the Russian advance slowed down due to swampy terrain. When the Russian cavalry switched from columns to battle line, Polish artillery opened canister shot fire on the Russians, dispersing them. The Russian commander reorganised his forces and repeated the charge, but the Russians were again repelled before reaching the Polish artillery emplacements. The Novgorod Cuirassier Regiment alone lost over 200 men out of 450 taking part in the charge. Jabłonowski's battery defending the Jerozolimskie Gate, an 1897 painting by Wojciech Kossak After half an hour the Russians finally stormed the ramparts of Fort 74 and defeated the Polish battalion defending it. This forced the Polish mobile artillery in Czyste, until then shelling the advancing Russian columns and their Grand Battery, to fall back. Meanwhile, the Russian right column was approaching Fort 72. Defended by only 200 men, the fort was approached by the Russian spearhead formed by the reinforced Nieśwież Regiment. Seeing this, the Polish commander ordered his cavalry reserve to charge the Russian infantry. Russian grenadiers stormed the ramparts of Fort 72, but were repelled and forced back behind the moat, where the Polish cavalry charged them. The Russians formed infantry squares, but were defeated and forced to retreat. To counter the threat to Russian infantry, General Nostitz charged his own cavalry reserve under General Georg von Sass, and a cavalry battle ensued. This saved Roth's infantry, as the Polish artillery's line of fire was blocked by both Polish and Russian cavalrymen. Both commanders threw more cavalry into the fight and soon the forces of both sides were similar, with 550 cavalrymen on both sides. Both forces soon lost cohesion and the battle turned into a series of duels between Polish Uhlans and Hussars (armed with lances and sabres) and Russian Cuirassiers and Dragoons (armed with heavier swords). The Poles were initially victorious and managed to incapacitate both General Nostitz and General von Sass, but were then attacked by additional Russian reinforcements and had to retreat. This forced some of the Polish artillery crews to retreat to the ramparts of the third line as well. The Russian Guard Hussar Regiment under Georg von Arpshofen, riding dapple grey heavy horses and wearing distinctive bright red uniforms, pursued the fleeing Polish cavalry to the space between forts 71 and 72. There they were met by Polish cavalry reinforcements: the 3rd Mounted Rifle Regiment was to hold the Hussars in place, while the 4th Uhlans Regiment was to attack the Russians from the flank. Before the plan could be enacted, the Russian veterans broke through this new Polish line of defence. The 3rd Regiment broke and started a retreat, followed by the Russians. General Umiński ordered his infantry and artillery to open fire at the mass of cavalry, both Polish and Russian. Small groups of Russians retreated to rejoin their lines, while others in apparent war fury tried to storm the heavily defended gates of Warsaw and were killed by Polish infantry. A small group succeeded and the last of them was killed as far as the gate of the Ujazdów Palace, into the city. The cavalry battle ended with all three regiments engaged in the skirmish almost annihilated. Polish cavalry charging Russian forces, an 1873 painting by Juliusz Kossak Although the Poles managed to contain and defeat the Russian cavalry, its charge and initial successes caused a widespread panic in Polish ranks. The garrison of Fort 72 abandoned its positions, leaving its guns behind, and retreated to Fort 73 without a fight. Likewise, the garrison of Fort 73 panicked, and its commanding officer, Col. Przedpełski, ordered his soldiers to block the guns, abandon the main rampart and assume defensive positions facing the back wall of the fort, expecting the Russian cavalry to enter the fortification from behind. This allowed the Russian infantry to capture Fort 72, a fortified \\"Red Inn\\" () and head towards Fort 73 unopposed. Polish officers managed to contain the panic just in time for their infantrymen to open rank fire on the approaching Russians and force them to withdraw. Fort 72 remained in Russian hands. The apparent panic in Polish ranks convinced Muraviev to renew his assault with fresh forces, despite the losses his columns had suffered. Col. Lukash's grenadiers reinforced with two battalions of the Finnish Guards Regiment (1,300 men, four guns) outflanked Fort 73 from the north and captured a brickyard and yet another fortified inn, the Karczma Żelazna directly to its rear. Its garrison offered only light resistance before retreating in disarray. The situation seemed critical, as the Russians were now in possession of a large part of the second line of Polish defences. Despite the apparent gravity of the situation, the Polish defenders still had sufficient fresh troops to counter-attack and regain the initiative. The Russians' recently captured positions were too far ahead of their artillery, and were all under well-aimed fire from Polish fixed artillery positions on the ramparts of the third line of defences, as well as numerous mobile artillery batteries. Forts 72 and 73, as well as the Karczma Żelazna inn and the brickyard received constant grapeshot fire. Under fire from all sides, the Russians had to hide behind the outer sides of the ramparts, unable to return fire or even observe the field in front of them. Tirailleurs of the Polish 3rd Foot Rifle Regiment approached the Karczma Żelazna inn almost unopposed and retook it. Soon afterwards they retook the brickyard as well. The Russians abandoned the two forts as well and although Russian light infantry tried to retake them, they were unsuccessful. Around 16:45 the field artillery batteries of Józef Bem were free to leave the safety of the inner defences, return to the battlefield, and open fire on the Grand Battery. Despite over three hours of intensive fighting in the west, the commander of the relatively peaceful southern sector, General Małachowski, did not reinforce the defenders of the western approaches.  Russian assault in the west  Although Muraviev's attack failed, it forced the Polish artillery to lessen the pressure on the Russian Grand Battery, which was now free to support the main Russian attack on the westernmost Polish defences. By that time the Grand Battery could shell the ramparts of the second line with relative impunity, thus damaging both the defences and the morale of the crews. Polish infantrymen manning the forts were ordered to lie down behind the gabions, which minimised the losses. Soldiers in the field had no such cover, and suffered casualties. The Grand Battery also silenced some of the guns in Forts 21, 22 and 23. General von Toll initially planned to order his infantry to start the assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position without the help of other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man. Simultaneously, von Pahlen's Corps attacked forts 23 and 24, and the Polish position at the Evangelical Cemetery. Heavy fighting followed, and many Russian commanders, including Paskevich, proposed that further fighting be postponed until the following day. General von Toll insisted on reaching the last line of Polish defences before sunset. The surrounding forts changed hands many times, but in the end most of them remained in Russian hands by 22:00, when the Russians broke off. Around midnight General Berg arrived in Warsaw with a new ultimatum signed by Paskevich.  Polish surrender  General Prądzyński was once again dispatched to the Russian headquarters, where he was greeted by Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich as Paskevich had been wounded shortly before. Although Michael believed the Poles were playing for time to allow Ramorino's Corps to return from Podlasie, Prądzyński convinced him to send General Berg to Warsaw with a draft of an act of unconditional surrender. The agreement (apparently never signed on paper) stipulated that the Polish Army was free to leave the city, a two-day cease-fire would come into effect and that Warsaw would be spared the horrors it experienced during the 1794 siege. No political clauses were included. Around 17:00 Prądzyński and Berg arrived in Warsaw, where Krukowiecki generally agreed with the Russian terms, but considered them too harsh. Berg and Prądzyński then returned to Russian headquarters and Grand Duke Michael agreed to allow the Polish Army free passage to Modlin and Płock, an amnesty to all fighters of the Uprising, and to exchange prisoners. The new terms were more than acceptable to Krukowiecki. Upon Prądzyński's return the more liberal wing of the government won a temporary majority, and Krukowiecki was ousted from power and replaced with Bonawentura Niemojowski as head of government and General Kazimierz Małachowski as Commander-in-Chief. = 8 September = The ultimatum required that Warsaw be surrendered immediately, along with the bridge and the suburb of Praga, and threatened the complete destruction of the city the following day. Following a heated debate, the new Polish authorities decided to comply by 5:00. Małachowski sent a letter to Paskevich notifying him that the army was withdrawing to Płock \\"to avoid further bloodshed and to prove its loyalty\\". The letter also expressed his hope that the Russians would allow free passage to troops unable to withdraw by the deadline, and that the army would honour the terms negotiated with Grand Duke Michael. The surrender of Warsaw was thus not a formal convention, but rather the effect of lengthy negotiations. The Russians initially respected its terms. The Polish Army withdrew across the Vistula and continued north towards the Modlin Fortress. The Sejm, Senate and many civilians also left the city \\"in grim silence\\". Many soldiers, including high-ranking officers, decided to stay in the city and lay down their arms. Up to 5,000 soldiers stayed in Warsaw, along with 600 officers, among them Generals Krukowiecki, Małachowski, Chrzanowski and Prądzyński. The food stores were opened, and their contents were distributed among the civilians. The following evening Grand Duke Michael Pavlovich entered the city leading his Imperial Guard; Warsaw capitulated.  Aftermath  Order reigns in Warsaw, French caricature, 1831 Although no large-scale evacuation of supplies from Warsaw was ordered, the Modlin Fortress was well prepared for a lengthy siege. Its magazines contained over 25,000 cannonballs, almost 900 thousand musket and rifle rounds and enough provisions for several months of full siege. The treasury of the Polish government was still intact and contained more than 6.5 million złotys. The fall of Warsaw was synonymous with the fall of Poland, both to Poles and to foreigners. To commemorate the crushing of the November Uprising, Alexander Pushkin wrote \\"On the Taking of Warsaw\\", hailing the capitulation of Poland's capital as the \\"final triumph\\" of Mother Russia. Other writers and poets joined in to celebrate, among them Vasily Zhukovsky, Fyodor Tyutchev and Aleksey Khomyakov. Soon afterwards the tsar practically dismantled the Kingdom of Poland: its constitution was abolished, the government given to Russian officials and its Warsaw University closed. The Russian medal awarded for capturing Warsaw was worn on the same ribbon as the Polish order of Virtuti Militari The news of the fall of Warsaw spread quickly. The French government, until then pressured both by Polish emissaries and by its own opposition to support the Poles, was relieved: French Minister of Foreign Affairs Horace Sébastiani declared to the Chamber of Deputies that \\"Order now reigns in Warsaw\\". The phrase became one of the best-known comments on the fall of Warsaw and was later often ridiculed by the supporters of the Polish cause. The Russian capture of the city in 1831 incited a wave of sympathy towards Poles. Several towns in the United States voted to change their names to Warsaw after the news of the battle reached their residents, among them Warsaw, Virginia and Warsaw, Kentucky. Shortly after the battle, in December 1831, the tsarist authorities issued a \\"For the Taking of Warsaw by Assault in 1831\\" Medal awarded to Russian veterans. A monument \\"To the Captors of Warsaw\\" was constructed near the former Redoubt 54. Demolished after Poland regained independence in 1918, the spot is now occupied by a post-war monument to Juliusz Konstanty Ordon and his soldiers. There are plans to move the monument closer to the site of the redoubt. The Battle of Warsaw is commemorated on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw, with the inscription \\"WARSZAWA 6–8 IX 1831\\".  Casualties  Poles crossing the Prussian frontier, an 1840 allegorical painting by Franciszek Faliński Early official Russian data assert that between eight and ten thousand were killed or wounded on the Russian side, and between six and seven thousand on the Polish side. Later the number of Polish losses mentioned in the Russian Army's dispatches was given as 139 officers and 7,745 NCOs and soldiers. This number includes both killed and wounded. Other sources give the total Polish casualties as 9,000: \\"probably at least 3,000\\" or even \\"over 4,000\\" on the first day and between 3,800 and 6,000 on the second day of the battle. Those numbers do not include sick and wounded taken prisoner following the Russian entry into Warsaw. Altogether, the Polish Army lost 16,000 men by 12 September, but this number includes many deserters in the period immediately following the battle. Official Russian estimates are 2,300–3,000 killed and wounded on the first day, and 7,460 on the second day. Both numbers are considered \\"ridiculously low\\" by later historians. Tomasz Strzeżek in his 1998 monograph of the battle notes that the official casualty figure was 10,559 Russian soldiers killed in action, including two generals, 16 colonels, 47 officers and 1,767 NCOs, as well as 1,182 soldiers missing and presumed dead. He notes that this might have been understated as some Russian regiments suffered tremendous losses, as evidenced by their official roll papers, but the data was apparently omitted in the army's official documents. After the battle there were 7,000 wounded Russian soldiers in Warsaw's hospitals, and 5,000 in field hospitals outside the city. The casualty rate among the wounded Russians was very high due to the low number of medical staff in the Russian army. Strzeżek estimates that between 14,000 and 16,000 Russians were killed or died of their wounds, and 4,000 were missing and presumed dead. At the time of the capitulation, the Poles held at least 3,000 Russian prisoners of war in Warsaw; the Russians held 2,590.

Early life Of Russian-Jewish origin, Polly was the eldest of nine children of Gertrude Koval and Morris Adler, a tailor who travelled throughout Europe on business. Her early education was from the village rabbi. Polly Adler emigrated to America from Yanow, Russia, near the Polish border at the age of 12, just before World War I. The war stopped her family from joining her. She lived for a time with family friends in Holyoke, Massachusetts, where she cleaned house and attended school and, at age 14, began working in the local paper mill; the following year she moved to Brooklyn, living for a time with cousins. She worked as a seamstress, at clothing factories, and sporadically attended school. At 19, she began to enjoy the company of theater people in Manhattan, and moved into the apartment of an actress and showgirl on Riverside Drive in New York City. It was at this apartment that she was introduced to a local bootlegger and gangster, who offered to pay Adler if she would allow him and his girlfriend to use her apartment. She began to procure for him and his friends, and became successful as a madam. Bordello owner She opened her first bordello in 1920, under the protection of mobster Dutch Schultz and a friend of mobster Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. One building in which she plied her trade was The Majestic at 215 West 75th Street, designed by architects Schwartz and Gross and completed in 1924 which contained hidden stairways and secret doorways. Her brothel's patrons included Peter Arno, Harold Ross, Desi Arnaz, George S. Kaufman, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Milton Berle, John Garfield, New York City mayor Jimmy Walker, and mobster Dutch Schultz.Dorothy Parker Society, \\"Polly Adler's Brothel\\" , Dorothy Parker Society It has been theorized that the New York State Supreme Court justice Joseph Force Crater, missing since Aug. 6, 1930, died in Polly Adler's brothel. Adler was a shrewd businesswoman with a mind for marketing. She determined that gaining publicity would be to her advantage, and she cultivated newspaper coverage by dressing flamboyantly, making grand appearances at nightclubs, and drawing attention to her beautiful employees. She also made large bribes to city and law enforcement officials to keep her business open. In the early 1930s, Adler was a star witness of the Seabury Commission investigations and spent a few months in hiding in Florida to avoid testifying. She refused to give up any mob names when apprehended by the police. She survived by providing half of her income to her underworld safety net, and closed her business. She retired in 1944. Adler attended college at age 50, and wrote a bestselling book, ghost written by Virginia Faulkner, A House Is Not a Home (1953), allowing her to live off the proceeds. She died in Los Angeles in 1962. A House Is Not a Home was made into a movie two years later, starring Shelley Winters as Adler. Her notoriety led her to be included in Cleveland Amory's 1959 Celebrity Register.  Trials  = Spring 1935 = During Fiorello La Guardia's time as a mayor, Polly Adler and three of her girls were brought to court. She pleaded guilty and was subsequently sentenced to 30 days in jail (of which she served 24, scrubbing the jail floors in May and June 1935) and paid an additional $500 fine. \\"A plea of guilty was entered for Polly Adler in Special Sessions yesterday to a charge of possessing a 'motion picture machine with objectionable pictures' in her East Fifty-fifth Street apartment when it was raided by the police last March 5.\\" \\"Another unexpected plea of guilty to maintaining an objectionable apartment at 30 East Fifty-fifth Street blocked in Special Sessions yesterday the trial of Polly Adlerphotos dated March 5, 1935 and March 14, 1935 on that and another charge that she kept an 'obscene motion picture film' in the suite last March when it was raided.\\" = January 1943 = \\"Polly Adler is in the prison ward of Bellevue Hospital, it became known yesterday, awaiting a hearing for the seventeenth time for maintaining a house of prostitution.\\"— \\"A charge of keeping and maintaining a house for prostitution against Pearl Davis, better known as Polly Adler, was dismissed by Magistrate Thomas H.

It was the first military aircraft produced by Bell. Originally designated the Bell Model 1, the Airacuda first flew on 1 September 1937. The Airacuda was marked by bold design advances and considerable flaws that eventually grounded the aircraft. The Airacuda was Bell Aircraft's answer for a \\"bomber destroyer\\" aircraft. Although it did see limited production, and one fully operational squadron was eventually formed, only one prototype and 12 production models were ultimately built, in three slightly different versions. Design and development Bell FM-1 mockup at Langley wind tunnel In an effort to break into the aviation business, Bell Aircraft created a unique fighter concept touted to be \\"a mobile anti-aircraft platform\\"Winchester 2005, p. 74. as well as a \\"convoy fighter.\\"Hanson, David. \\"Bell YFM-1 Airacuda.\\" daveswarbirds.com, September 2009. Retrieved: 18 October 2009. Created to intercept enemy bombers at distances beyond the range of single-seat fighter interceptors, the YFM-1 (Y, service test; F, fighter; M, multiplace) was an innovative design incorporating many features never before seen in a military aircraft, as well as several never seen again. Using a streamlined, \\"futuristic\\" design, the Bell Airacuda appeared to be \\"unlike any other fighters up to that time.\\"Shilling, Erik. \\"Flying the Prototypes.\\" Planes and Pilots Of World War Two. Retrieved: 10 June 2011. According to Major Alexander De Seversky's 1942 book, Victory Through Air Power, the Bell Airacuda \\"represents a great engineering achievement. But its designation as ′convoy fighter′ is erroneous, since that requires different disposition of armament. With its maximum firepower directed forward, it really offers a preview of an effective long- range interceptor fighter.\\" A forward-firing M4 cannon with an accompanying gunner was mounted in a forward compartment of each of the two engine nacelles.Norton 2008, pp. 123–125. Although capable of aiming the cannons, the gunners' primary purpose was simply to load them with the 110 rounds of ammunition stored in each nacelle. The crew of five included the pilot and gunners; a copilot/navigator who doubled as a fire-control officer, using a Sperry Instruments \\"Thermionic\\" fire control system (originally developed for anti-aircraft cannon) combined with a gyro-stabilised and an optical sight to aim the weapons; and a radio operator/gunner armed with a pair of machine guns stationed at mid-fuselage waist blisters for defense against attack from the rear. An unusual feature of the Airacuda was the main door for entry. The door was opened and pulled down and hinges folded in on three steps for the crew to climb into the aircraft. =Design flaws= Bell YFM-1 during testing The Airacuda was plagued with problems from the start. The lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as, despite its sleek looks, the Airacuda was heavy and was slower than most bombers. In the event of interception by enemy fighters, the Airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight, while the meager bombload was of little use in the intended fighter-bomber role. Even the 37 mm cannons were of less value than predicted. The cannons had a tendency to fill the gun nacelles with smoke whenever fired and, additionally, fears persisted as to how the gunners would escape in an emergency, with the propellers directly behind them. An emergency bailout would have required both propellers to be feathered, though additional provision was made with the use of explosive bolts on the propellers to jettison them in the event of a bailout. As with other types armed with the 37mm M4, the low muzzle velocity of the weapon made it difficult to use as an aerial weapon, limiting the useful range significantly (although this was never a problem for the YFM-1 since it never actually entered combat). The Allison V-1710-41 engines, though relatively trouble-free in other types, had insufficient cooling systems installed. Like many pusher designs, they were prone to overheating while on the ground, since there is no propwash blowing over the engines to cool them. On the ground, the aircraft had to be towed to and from the runway and could only be started when the Airacuda was able to take off immediately. Even in the air it was not uncommon to experience overheating problems. Although designed for turbo-supercharging, the first flights were made with V-1710-9 single-stage supercharged engines that only delivered each. Despite the -long shaft extensions, there were no problems with this feature. When the turbos were fitted to the later YFM-1, they were plagued by cranky turbo regulators that backfired continuously. An explosion during a September 1939 test flight made it apparent that the teething engine troubles would not be solved easily. Additionally, Marshall Wainwright notes that other sources indicate the first eight aircraft were to originally have been powered by Allison V-1710-13 engines fitted with GE Type B-6 turbo-superchargers (turbochargers). These aircraft were eventually delivered with improved V-1710-23(D2) engines. Wainwright further states that two of the YFM-1 airframes were changed on the production line to accept the V-1710-41 without turbo-supercharging, becoming YFM-1Bs. This is noted in a contract change dated 19 October 1939 which shows that aircraft 38-489 and 38-490 had their turbos, all associated ducting, and controls removed and V-1710-41(D2A) \\"Altitude Rated\\" engines installed instead. The (D2A) was essentially a -23 with higher supercharger gear ratios (8.77:1 versus 6.23:1), which allowed the motor to develop around up to ASL. They used the same ratings and components as the Altitude Rated V-1710-33(C15) Allison fitted to the original Curtiss XP-40. Allison was paid $1,690 to modify each engine.Wainwright 2008Plummer 1997, p. 11. Initial flight testing by Lt. Ben Kelsey proved the Airacuda virtually impossible to control with only one engine, as the aircraft would go into an immediate spin. Problems with stability in pitch were also encountered, and had to be corrected by reducing power. Test pilot Erik Shilling described his experiences in a later book, Destiny: A Flying Tiger's Rendezvous With Fate as: > Flying the Bell Airacuda was a new experience for me, since it was the first > pusher aircraft I'd ever flown. Its handling characteristics were foreign to > anything I had ever had my hands on. Under power it was unstable in pitch, > but stable with power off. While flying straight and level, if a correction > in pitch was required, a forward push on the control resulted in the > airplane wanting to pitch over even more. Pitch control became a matter of > continually jockeying the controls, however slightly, even when the aircraft > was in proper trim. The same applied if pulling back on the control. It > would tend to continue pitching up, requiring an immediate corrective > response. The same happened in a turn with power off, the Bell became stable > in pitch. This was fortunate because during approach and landing, it was > very stable, and a nice flying airplane.\\" The Airacuda was also saddled with a complex and temperamental electrical system and was the only aircraft ever built to rely on an independent auxiliary power unit (APU) to power both engine fuel pumps, as well as all aircraft electrical systems.Winchester 2005, p. 75. Systems usually powered by an aircraft's engines were instead powered by the single generator. The generator, with its own supercharger, was located in the belly of the aircraft. In the event of a failure (and they occurred frequently), the crew was instructed to begin immediate emergency restart procedures as the aircraft basically shut down. When the APU failed, the pilot had \\"NO fuel pressure, NO vacuum, NO hydraulic pressure, NO gear, NO flaps and NO ENGINES\\".Berliner, S., III. \\"Bell FM-1 Airacuda.\\" Aviation at home.att.net, 2 June 2005. Retrieved: 18 October 2009. Accidents Page from Bell YFM-1 and YFM-1B handbook (T.O.-01-110HA-1) showing emergency equipment and exits. Despite the aircraft's many faults, only two were lost in accidents (although considering that only 12 were ever built, the statistics are not favorable with many other types, at a 16.6% loss ratio; especially when the actual aircraft saw so little operational service that would even expose it to hazard of accidents). The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt which was part of the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda down hard in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped. All three Airacudas with tricycle landing gear encountered problems and were damaged at one time or another. The most serious accident occurred to YFM-1A (Model 8) 38-497, on a flight between Chanute Field, Illinois, and Keesler Field, Mississippi, when a broken oil line started a fire. The cause of the broken line appeared to be serious airframe vibration encountered during the flight. With no way of extinguishing the fire, both the pilot and crew chief agreed to bail out. The pilot was killed when his parachute failed to deploy (he may have struck the tail while bailing out). This was the only fatality to occur during the flying of Airacudas. The accident investigation report stated \\"inherent defects in design caused constant maintenance difficulties and the flying of this type has been very limited.\\" Operational history Bell XFM-1 Airacuda in flight Despite these problems, one fully operational Airacuda squadron was eventually assembled, and operated from 1938 until 1940. Funds were appropriated, but never released, for the purchase of two groups of Airacudas. Continuing problems gave the aircraft a reputation as \\"hangar queens\\".Plummer 1997, p. 22. Near the end of the type's operational life, the aircraft were flown primarily for photo opportunities and always accompanied by a chase plane for safety. Eventually the decision was made to disperse the aircraft to various airfields to give pilots an opportunity to add the unusual aircraft to their log books. Airacudas were sent at various times to Langley Field, Virginia; Maxwell Field, Alabama; Hamilton Field, California; and Wright Field, in Dayton, Ohio. YFM-1 38-488 was displayed at the 1940 World's Fair in New York, finished in the markings of the 27th Pursuit Squadron. During this time, the aircraft saw limited flight time, as few pilots were interested in flying the unusual aircraft. Several plans were made to modify the Airacudas to give them operational status, including modifying the airframe and adding more powerful engines, but all proposals were eventually rejected. In early 1942, despite fears of enemy bomber attacks against which the Airacuda was intended, the aircraft were stricken from inventory. Variants The prototype, known as the XFM-1, incorporated a tailwheel, side \\"blister\\" ports, and a smooth, rounded canopy. This is the best known, and most produced version. An updated version called the YFM-1A eliminated the side blisters and added externally mounted radiators and turbo-superchargers. Produced in 1940, the final version designated YFM-1B, was slightly larger, had slightly less powerful Allison engines and incorporated a tricycle landing gear. The canopy was redesigned, with a flat forward windshield. A rearward-facing belly gunner's position was also added. The resulting aircraft was roughly the size of a Douglas B-18 Bolo medium bomber. Three YFM-1Bs were produced in 1939 before production was finally terminated. ;XFM-1 :(Model 1) Prototype powered by two 1,150 hp V-1710-13 engines, one (38-351) built.Andrade 1979, p. 117.Manly 1942, p. 32, Figure 15: Bell XFM-1. ;YFM-1 :(Model 7) Development aircraft powered by two 1,150 hp V-1710-23 engines and fitted with 37 mm cannons in wing nacelles, eight built, two later converted to YFM-1B. ;YFM-1A :(Model 8) Development aircraft with tricycle landing gear, three built. ;YFM-1B :YFM-1 re-engined with 1,090 hp V-1710-41 engines, two converted from YFM-1. ;YFM-1C :(Model 17) – proposed variant not proceeded with.  Scrapping  By 1942, all nine surviving YFM-1 airframes had been flown by ferry crews to a training facility at Chanute Field, Illinois, where the aircraft were assigned to the 10th Air Base Squadron to be used for ground crew instruction. By March 1942, all Airacudas had been scrapped. Specifications (XFM-1) See also References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= *Andrade, John.

It was headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, but was initially formed at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. It was re- designated as Air Education and Training Command (AETC) following a merger with Air University (AU) on 1 July 1993.Manning, Thomas A. (2005), History of Air Education and Training Command, 1942–2002. Office of History and Research, Headquarters, AETC, Randolph AFB, Texas ASIN: B000NYX3PC ATC was organized on 1 July 1946 as a re-designation of Army Air Forces Training Command (AAFTC) as part of the re-organization of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) after World War II. For nearly 50 years, ATC was the primary training organization of the United States Air Force from its inception as an independent service in September 1947. It provided pilot and aircrew training; technical training, and enlisted and officer basic training. At the end of the Cold War, it was merged with Air University (AU) in July 1993 as part of a major top-to-bottom reorganization of the USAF. Personnel, equipment and resources of both organizations were re-designated as Air Education and Training Command (AETC), which assumed the mission of both organizations, but retained AU as a subordinate organization within AETC. History =Postwar era= Formation On 1 July 1946, Army Air Forces Training Command was re- designated as Air Training Command (ATC). Since the end of World War II in September 1945, AAF Training Command had been undergoing rapid contraction, actually begun earlier in 1945 as planners understood the changing forces of the war against Nazi Germany, which ended in May 1945. Excess training bases across the United States had begun to be shut down and units consolidated during the summer of 1945 as the training needs of the USAAF was being refocused to support the requirements of those USAAF combat units in the war against Imperial Japan. The Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 and the end of the war in the Pacific in September 1945 began a rapid demobilization of the U.S. armed forces. Large numbers of temporary training bases were closed and units were discontinued in late 1945 and early 1946 as the US military transitioned from a wartime footing to a peacetime one. For that reason, ATC was organized in the summer of 1946 to become the main training organization of the postwar USAAF. One of the major organizational changes of the postwar USAAF was the elimination of the \\"command\\" organizational echelon. While most wartime Commands became \\"Air Divisions\\" in the postwar USAAF table of organization, the USAAF Training Command was elevated to the major air command echelon along with the new Tactical Air Command (TAC), Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Air Defense Command (ADC). Organization ATC was organized around the AAFTC's Flying Training Command and Technical Training Commands, which were redesignated as the ATC Flying and Technical Training Divisions on 1 November 1946. A third Division was formed with the creation of the ATC Indoctrination Division, which was organized around the Military Training Center in San Antonio, Texas (which had earlier been a part of Technical Training Command). All three Divisions of ATC were co-equal in status. In June 1946, the USAAF discontinued the World War II Flying Training Wings allocated to AAFTC and each training installation was commanded by its designated Army Air Forces Base Unit (AAFBU). In September 1947, upon establishment of the United States Air Force (USAF) as an independent service, the AAFBUs on the permanent Army Air Forces bases became Air Force Base Units (AFBU) upon the bases' transfer to the USAF. By mid-1948, with the adoption by the USAF of the Hobson Plan Wing-Base organization (as opposed to the AFBU Base organization), the AFBUs were discontinued or redesignated in favor of new USAF four-digit \\"table of distribution units\\" established by USAF or the Major Commands. The Army Air Forces had set a post-war goal of 70 groups; however, Congress balked at funding the ambitious undertaking. Instead, the USAAF had to downscale its plans, settling on 55 groups. Congress passed the National Security Act of September 1947, and soon after, the Air Force became a separate service with its own civilian service secretary, equal to the Army and Navy. By 31 December 1947, the USAF was 55 groups strong, with ATC being allocated thirteen (13) training bases. Earlier in the year, the ATC commander, Lieutenant General John K. Cannon, had told General Carl A. Spaatz, USAF Chief of Staff, that ATC would do all it could to bring the new groups up to strength, but the training capability of ATC was extremely limited due to a severe lack of personnel and training funds. The initial training bases of Air Training Command were: * Randolph Field (later Randolph Air Force Base), Texas : 2532d Army Air Forces (later Air Force) Base Unit : 3510th Pilot Training Wing (Basic) * Barksdale Field (Barksdale Air Force Base), LouisianaConducted flying training and was HQ AAFTC location from 25 February 1946 until 17 October 1949; transferred to Strategic Air Command : 331st Army Air Forces (later Air Force) Base Unit : 3500th Pilot Training Wing (Advanced, Multi-Engine) * Chanute Field (later Chanute Air Force Base), Illinois : 3502d Army Air Forces Base Unit (Technical School) : 3345th Technical Training Wing * Fort Francis E.

However, by early 1947, the USAAF had sped up its conversion to jet aircraft. The only way training needs could be met was by limiting course quotas to commands already using jet aircraft. Also, the training program was handicapped by the fact that no dual-control jet trainer aircraft existed.Manning, Jet Fighter Training, p. 48. In addition, the pilot training program was consolidated into two classes, Basic and Advanced. Also, the wide variety of training aircraft were reduced to streamline the training program. Jet training aircraft and courses were also added, along with helicopter training as the new wartime technologies were added into the postwar Air Force inventory as fully operational weapons systems. Austere postwar military budgets led to additional consolidations and all of the flying programs suffered from shortages of aircraft replacement parts, qualified maintenance personnel, and instructors...problems that existed with the schools throughout the early postwar era.Manning, Basic Flying Training, p. 49. Technical Division was given the responsibility of assembling and training two specialized arctic training teams. Their mission was to indoctrinate USAAF (later USAF) units and individuals destined for polar assignments in personal survival and in the care and use of equipment in cold weather climates.Manning, Polar Mobile Training Units, p. 45. In March 1947, budgetary cuts caused a major reduction in force of graded civilian employees. Technical Division had no choice but to fill empty civilian instructor slots with military personnel. That left the schools with a high percentage of instructors with little, if any, teaching experience and, in some cases, very limited knowledge of course material. In fact, many of these new instructors had just graduated from the courses they were now expected to teach.Manning, Cutbacks in Technical Training, p. 49. Indoctrination Division consolidated all basic training at what became Lackland Air Force Base in 1946.Manning, Basic Military Training, p. 46. Separation criteria were progressively lowered for both officer and enlisted personnel as part of the postwar demobilization. Training Command losses from separations were not made up by gains from recruits and returnees and shortages were particularly acute in maintenance, mess, clerical, and medical personnel.Manning, Separations, p. 46. In 1948, Air Training Command began rebuilding its training complex, but the command was still reeling from the heavy losses it sustained in its instructor force by demobilization.Manning, 1948 overview, p. 53. =Berlin Airlift= By 1948, ATC was still reeling from the heavy losses it sustained in its instructor force in 1947. Then the personnel withdrawals that had to be made in support of the Berlin Airlift and the expansion of Strategic Air Command combined to handicap even more the training bases at the same time that pilot production increased. Plans called for ATC to add five additional flight training bases and by year's end the command had already activated four: Perrin AFB, Texas; Enid AFB, Oklahoma; Waco AFB, Texas; and Las Vegas AFB, Nevada. In a 17 September letter to the field, Headquarters USAF directed all commands to release many highly experienced personnel in support of the Berlin Airlift. Officials in Air Training Command were so concerned about the effect this loss of personnel would have on mission accomplishment that a return letter was sent to Washington asking which of the new flying training bases—Waco or Enid—was to be written off. The only way ATC was able to provide personnel for these schools was by taking individuals from other bases. =Consolidation of Divisions= When the Berlin Blockade ended in 1949, the Air Force was again hit with reductions that resulted in forced reorganizations and reduced training. Austere postwar military budgets led to additional consolidations and all of the technical programs suffered from shortages of instructors...problems that existed with the schools throughout the early postwar era. The last half of 1949 was an exercise in austerity. President Harry S. Truman decided that the country could only afford a 48-group Air Force and with only a minimum of operating funds available, the Secretary of Defense directed major spending cuts throughout the Department of Defense (DOD). In a reorganization, Technical Division, Air Training Command was inactivated on 14 November 1949 when Air Training Command absorbed its subordinate Divisions into its command organization to comply with the budget reduction directive.Manning, 1949 overview, p. 57. Korean War Students prepare to take off on a cross-country flight in F-51 Mustang fighters at Nellis AFB, Nevada, 1950. The outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 indicated that ATC would soon see an increase in training requirements. By 1 July, the Air Force had directed ATC to accelerate training to fill the needs of a new 95-wing Air Force. A few days later, ATC found itself with a new mission: combat crew training.Manning, 1950 overview, p. 57. ATC's primary mission in the Korean War was to train pilots, navigators and enlisted aircrew for combat and to fill the need of the expanded 95-wing USAF. The first school opened at Nellis AFB, Nevada. In August, the Air Staff raised the rate of pilot production from 3,000 to 4,000 per year, and by the end of the year, it had climbed to 7,200. At the same time, the need for training technicians also rose. As it had in World War II, ATC met the increased training requirements by contracting with civilian schools. * Bainbridge Air Base, Georgia : 3306th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Bartow Air Base, Florida : 3303d Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Graham Air Base, Florida : 3300th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Hondo Air Base, Texas : 3304th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Malden Air Base, Missouri : 3305th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Marana Air Base, Arizona : 3307th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Moore Air Base, Texas : 3301st Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Spence Air Base, Georgia : 3302d Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary) * Stallings Air Base, North Carolina : : 3308th Pilot Training Group (Contract Primary)Manning, 1950 overview, p. 82. B-29s line the ramp at Randolph AFB as one takes off on a training mission, c. 1950. These were former World War II pilot training airfields that were placed in reserve status after the war. Air Training Command applied the \\"Air Base\\" designator to these military-supervised/contractor-operated flying training bases. At about the same time, ATC redesignated the 3595th Pilot Training Wing (Advanced Single-Engine) as the 3595th Training Wing (Combat Crew). On 17 July 1950, Nellis AFB began a special training program to provide 115 combat-ready F-51 Mustang pilots for Far East Air Forces and 92 combat-ready F-80 Shooting Star pilots to serve as replacements for casualties in the first months of the Korean campaign. The Korean War caused Lackland AFB, Texas to overflow with trainees. During the first two weeks of 1951, the population at Lackland AFB jumped from 36,513 to over 70,000 personnel. With the large influx of enlisted personnel requiring indoctrination training, Air Training Command took interest in the former Sampson Naval Training Station, New York for use as an addition Basic Military Training base for enlisted personnel. Custody of most of the property of the training center was transferred to the Air Force in 1950, and the Air Force named the facility Sampson Air Force Base on 15 November 1950. The Air Force spent about $6 million on renovations and Air Training Command established the 3650th Indoctrination (later Military Training) Wing to manage the base and conduct Basic Training. The first trainees arrived on 1 February 1951, with the base employing about 700 civilians and had 600 permanent party uniformed USAF personnel. Eventually, about 6,000 Air Force recruits would be trained at Sampson AFB. The Air Force also built a runway and other facilities at Sampson and converted the base to its needs. By 1953, a single paved 5000 foot north/south runway (Rwy 17/35) was completed and a control tower, fire station and aircraft parking ramp was built on the west side, with B-25 Mitchell, C-47 Skytrain, and C-45 Expeditor aircraft assigned. In early 1951 recruits arrived by the train load, more than doubling the population of Lackland AFB. In addition to Sampson AFB, a third BMT center was established at Parks AFB, California to accommodate new enlistees. A former World War II Navy Seebee training facility known as Camp Parks, the Air Force had to completely rebuild the base. Base personnel were initially housed in temporary facilities and ate from a field mess. The first group of Airmen arrived at Camp Parks in the Summer of 1951; mass training began in March 1952. The USAF had Far East Air Force engaging in direct combat, and Tactical Air Command mobilizing reserve forces and deploying active duty units and personnel to the combat zone. Strategic Air Command, while not deploying its nuclear-capable strategic bomber force, brought B-29 Superfortresses out of five years of storage and deployed them to Okinawa with combat crews from active duty and reserve units. Beginning on 24 July 1950, all technical training programs went on a six-day-a-week operation. That reduced by almost 17 percent the amount of time it took to train an enlisted technician. Multiple shifts also ran. While this increased the need for more instructors, it limited the amount of housing and dining facilities needed. Along with this, the amount of dormitory space given each student was reduced from to 60, and at Keesler AFB and Sheppard AFB the space was even less...only per student. Finally, the interval between class entries also decreased. All of this was an effort to train students as quickly as possible and get them in the field.Manning, Technical Training—Vertical Expansion, p. 65. Retreat formation in front of Base HQ, Sampson AFB, New York The announcement of unlimited recruiting in December 1950 caused major problems for Lackland AFB. Clothing and bedding were in short supply, and it got to the point where new recruits were issued only the minimum essentials. Clothing stocks had to be drastically reduced at other ATC bases so recruits could receive essential clothing—although it was impossible to provide exact sizes. Lackland AFB had only been constructed to handle about 28,000 recruits, but by January 1951 the number exceeded 70,000. Officials had no choice but to establish a tent city. Lackland AFB completely exhausted the Air Force's supply of steel folding cots and mattresses. Others had to make do with canvas cots. At one time, the base had almost 10,000 recruits sleeping on canvas cots, without mattresses.Manning, Overcrowding at Lackland, p. 77. There was no time to prepare, and that meant the quality of training suffered...both flying and technical training. Because troops in the Far East received priority in the supply system, ATC also faced across-the-board shortages in equipment such as armament, radar, aircraft spares, maintenance items, clothing, bedding, and office equipment. Shortages of spare parts even caused a reduction in helicopter training at San Marcos AFB and B-29 training at Randolph AFB later in the war. BMT Graduates May 1953, Parks AFB, California The Air Force initially resorted to an involuntary recall of Air Force Reservists and Air National Guardsmen to fill the gap while Air Training Command expanded its training efforts to meet wartime demands. By 1 July, the Air Force had directed ATC to accelerate training to fill the needs of a new 95-wing Air Force. A few days later ATC found itself with a new mission: combat crew training.Manning, Recall of Reservists, p. 70. As a direct result of the rapid expansion of the training needs of the Air Force as a result of the Korean War, ATC reversed its 1949 decision to eliminate training divisions and consolidate all command level organizations at its headquarters. Headquarters USAF approved the decentralization in early 1951. While ATC had sought numerical designations for its new air forces—Thirtieth Flying Training and Thirty-first Technical Training Air Forces—USAF officials recommended functional rather than numerical designations. Thus, ATC's new subordinate organizations became the Flying Training Air Force (FTAF) and the Technical Training Air Force.Manning, ATC and Crew Training, p. 68. Plans called for FTAF to be headquartered at Randolph AFB and TTAF at Lowry AFB; however, the unexpected escalation of training at those bases meant facilities were not available. Thus, ATC established the FTAF headquarters at Waco, Texas near James Connally AFB, and TTAF took up residence at the Gulf Coast Military Academy near Keesler AFB. A third organization, the Crew Training Air Force, was activated on 16 March 1952 and headquartered at Randolph AFB. Cold War Even as combat continued in Korea, during 1952 the Air Force expanded to meet the threat of the Cold War with the Soviet Union in Europe, and potentially a direct conflict with Communist China in Asia. As the Air Force expanded to meet those threats, ATC continued to expand as it activated five more flying training bases, bringing the number of primary installations to 42.Manning, 1952 overview, p. 79. During the last half of 1952, however, the volume of training conducted steadily decreased as the supply of trained pilots and technicians met the Air Force demand in almost all areas. Air Training Command reached its Korean War peak of 176,446 personnel in June. The most important change in the training program involved the inauguration of four-phase pilot training. Phase one of the program included 12 weeks of preflight training. The second phase, called primary training, required 18 weeks and featured 20 hours of T-6 Texan flight training. Phase three, basic flight, lasted 16 weeks and included 130 hours of flying. This phase included flying in both the T-6 or T-28 and in tactical aircraft (T-33 jet trainer, F-80 jet fighter, F-51 conventional fighter, or B-25 multi-engine bomber). At the end of the third phase, cadets were commissioned and received pilot wings. When ATC completed its program of decentralization by activating the CTAF in March 1952, it then provided combat crew training to the major combat commands. Crew Training constituted the fourth phase of pilot training and covered an average of 12 weeks.Manning, Four-Phase Pilot Training, p. 85. With the end of the Korean War and cutbacks in the military budget afterwards, Air Training Command discontinued its basic training schools at Sampson and Parks AFB on 1 July 1956. A T-37 Tweet from the 85th Flying Training Squadron, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, flies over Lake Amistad during a training mission. In 1960, ATC began looking at a new training concept, consolidated pilot training (CPT), combining preflight, primary, and basic instruction. Secretary of the Air Force Dudley C. Sharp approved the idea in March 1960, and Air Training Command intended to have the training program in operation by March 1961. At the same time, Secretary Sharp approved initiation of a consolidated pilot training program, ATC decided to replace all civilian flying instructors with military officers and to phase out all contract primary schools. The last of these closed in spring 1961.Manning, Consolidated Pilot Training, p. 132. Shortly after the beginning of the Korean War, the Air Staff transferred most of the combat aircrew training mission from the operational commands to ATC, placing an even heavier burden on the command. Air Force directed Air Training Command to double pilot production to 7,200 per year, and to increase technician production to 225,000 per year. With the end of the Korean War on 27 July 1953, Air Training Command again began to reduce its training activities.Manning, Basic Pilot Training, p.74. Many of the command's facilities were transferred to Strategic Air Command (SAC) and Tactical Air Command (TAC) in the 1950s. Over the next ten years, ATC reduced its bases from 43 to 16, and its personnel from 271,849 to 79,272. In large part this was due to the return of the crew training mission to the operational commands. In 1958, ATC returned bomber crew training to SAC and fighter crew training to TAC. At about the same time, ATC gained another mission when it took over responsibility for the recruiting mission in 1954. Then in October 1957, Headquarters Air Training Command moved from Scott AFB, Illinois, to Randolph AFB, Texas, in order to reduce operating costs by being closer to its primary training facilities. Its three training air forces were inactivated between 1 July 1957 and 1 April 1958.Manning, FTAF/CTAF Merger, p. 111. One year later, the command began experimenting with eliminating propeller-driven aircraft from primary pilot training. \\"Project All-Jet\\" was a success, and in 1959, ATC began replacing the North American T-28 \\"Trojan\\" propeller-driven trainer with the Cessna T-37 \\"Tweety Bird\\" jet engine primary trainer. Vietnam War era In the early 1960s, ATC converted from specialized to generalized undergraduate pilot training (UPT). During this time, the command retired the World War II–era North American B-25 \\"Mitchell\\" it had been using for advanced multi-engine training under specialized UPT. Under generalized UPT, all pilots received the same training, regardless of what type of operational aircraft they would ultimately fly. ATC acquired the North American T-38 \\"Talon\\" jet, and it became the main advanced trainer aircraft for all student pilots. The first T-37/T-38 undergraduate pilot training course was held at Webb AFB, Texas, in February 1962. During the next few years, increasing numbers of US service members went to Southeast Asia as military advisers to the South Vietnamese armed forces, but the effect on ATC was negligible.Manning, Foreign Pilot Training, p. 44. When president Lyndon B. Johnson increased America's military involvement in South Vietnam in 1965, there was a resultant increase in Air Force military and technical training. However, unlike previous wars, the Vietnam War did not result in a drastic increase in the command's bases or personnel. This was because ATC reverted to a split-phase program of basic military training, and because the command's training philosophy was geared toward generalized rather than specialized technical training.Manning, Split-Phase BMT Reborn, p. 160. USAF Basic Training graduation photo, 3332d BMTS Flight 495, December 1966, Amarillo AFB, Texas/ Pilot training gradually increased as the war dragged on. But officials reassigned many of ATC's best instructor pilots to the operational commands, creating severe flying training difficulties. Then in 1969, ATC's involvement in a program of training and equipping the Republic of Vietnam Air Force to become a self-sufficient, 40-squadron air force caused technical training production to surge by approximately 50 percent, to over 310,000. This increase, however, was not to last long. In February 1966 ATC's Amarillo Air Technical Training Center became a Basic Training Center with the formation of the 3330th Basic Military School due to an outbreak of spinal meningitis at Lackland AFB. A personnel processing squadron was added the same month to support the school. In 1967 the center's facilities covered 5,273 acres (21 km2) and had about 16,300 assigned personnel. However, due to the influx of trainees for the Vietnam buildup, Amarillo continued to conduct Split-Phase Basic Military Training for enlisted airmen with Lackland AFB. Strategic Air Command began closing down its operations at Amarillo AFB in early 1968. Personnel and equipment of the 461st Bombardment Wing were transferred to other SAC organizations during the spring, and the wing was declared non- operational at the end of February. The 461st BW was discontinued and inactivated on 25 May 1968. The last BMT class at Amarillo AFB graduated on 11 December 1968, and the base closed on 31 December 1968. Post-Vietnam era ATC T-37 trainers at Vance AFB, Oklahoma, 1971 As popular support for the Vietnam War waned and American forces began to pull out of Southeast Asia, ATC's training requirements gradually diminished. President Richard Nixon ended the draft on 30 June 1973, converting the military to an all-volunteer force. Also, during this period the percentage of recruits with a high school education declined to the lowest point in the history of the Air Force. These factors combined to make the 1970s yet another era of change for Air Training Command.Manning, 1972 Overview, p. 189. One change was in the command's approach to technical training. Poor retention rates and the generally lower quality of recruits prompted ATC to shift from a \\"career oriented\\" technical training philosophy to one of teaching only those tasks recruits needed during their first enlistment. This reduced the length of training while also lowering training costs. To supplement on-duty training, and in hopes of attracting higher-quality recruits, Air Force established the Community College of the Air Force in 1972 as part of ATC. Another change came in the form of increased opportunities for women. The first class of 10 women pilots in the USAF received their wings on 2 September 1977, and the first class of female graduates from undergraduate navigator training received their wings at Mather AFB, California, on 12 October 1977.Manning, 1976 Overview, p. 208. Other changes came out of the need to reduce training costs in order to fund the F-15, F-16 and A-10 modernization programs. These included closing Craig and Webb Air Force Bases, increasing reliance on flight simulators, and reducing flying hours in undergraduate pilot training.Manning, Flying Training, p. 213. Still another change was the way in which ATC conducted undergraduate navigator training. In 1978, navigator training shifted from generalized to specialized, with follow-on advanced training specific to the student's career track. In keeping with the consolidations of the 1970s, Air Training Command assumed responsibility in 1978 for two additional functions: Air University and cryptologic training. Air Force transferred Air University to ATC effective 15 May 1978. This consolidation brought all professional military education under the same roof as basic military, technical, and flying training. However, Air Force officials soon became concerned this arrangement lowered the visibility and diminished the importance of Air War College and the other schools. Therefore, on 1 July 1983 – little more than five years after the realignment – Air Force once again conveyed separate command status upon Air University. The USAF Security Service at Goodfellow AFB, Texas, had conducted all Air Force cryptologic training since 1958. On 1 July 1978, both Goodfellow and the cryptologic training mission transferred to ATC.Manning, Goodfellow AFB, Texas, Reassigned to ATC, p. 218. T-38s overfly Randolph AFB During the military expansion of the Reagan Administration in the early 1980s, ATC was able to improve training in several areas. The command added more flying hours to the pilot training program and extended the course by three weeks. In the fall of 1981, ATC began training pilots from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries under the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) program at Sheppard AFB, Texas.Manning, Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training, p. 225. In 1984, expanded training budgets allowed the command to change back to a philosophy of training technical personnel to the fullest extent possible, rather than limiting training to the skills needed only for the first enlistment. Technical training courses, especially those in \\"sortie-producing\\" specialties, were expanded from generalist courses to specialized instruction. By 1985, the average length for these courses had risen to nearly 17 weeks. However, several events in the middle and late 1980s brought about the next cycle of restricted military spending affecting ATC's mission. By Fiscal Year 1988, funding for technical training dropped by over 15 percent, and the command had to institute a civilian hiring freeze. Then, in rapid succession beginning in 1989, the Berlin Wall came down, the Soviet Union collapsed, and the Cold War was over. Suddenly, the threat from the East that had dominated American military thinking for decades was gone. Congress quickly cut military spending in response to the diminished threat.Manning, 1988 in Review, p. 257. Persian Gulf War and post-Cold War reorganization of the 1990s In the midst of these world changes, the Persian Gulf War erupted when Saddam Hussein's Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait on 2 August 1990. In support of wartime demands, ATC deployed over 3,000 command personnel to other commands. Then ATC called up 2,387 individual mobilization augmentee (IMA) Air Force Reservists and over 1,000 inactive Air Force Reservists and Air Force retirees to fill active duty positions vacated by wartime deployments. Air Force also activated ATC's 11th Contingency Hospital and deployed it to the United Kingdom to treat expected casualties from the war. Fortunately, the Persian Gulf War did not produce large numbers of American casualties, and the conflict was soon over.Manning, Operation Desert Storm, p. 274. Air Training Command got on with the task of consolidating training and in Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994, executed BRAC-directed closures of Chanute AFB, Mather AFB, Williams AFB, and Lowry AFB. However, despite the return to tightened budgets, ATC did not back off from its commitment to fully train personnel to be mission ready upon arrival at their first operational assignment.Manning, Closing Installations, p. 285. An especially important Year of Training initiative was the recommendation to create a single, coherent education and training structure for officer, enlisted, and civilian personnel. As a result of this recommendation, Air Force again merged Air University and ATC, redesignating the command as the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) on 1 July 1993. =Lineage= * Established as Air Corps Flying Training Command on 23 January 1942 : Re-designated: Army Air Forces Flying Training Command c. 15 March 1942 : Re-designated: Army Air Forces Training Command on 31 July 1943 : Re-designated: Air Training Command on 1 July 1946 : Re-designated: Air Education and Training Command on 1 July 1993 =Assignments= ;

The Court developed a case-by-case test for determining if a communication is privileged. Prior to the test, only communications that fell into one of narrow set of privilege classes could gain protection from being submitted in a court of law. Background Adele Rosemary Gruenke was a 22-year-old reflexologist (a type of therapy similar to acupressure). Philip Barnett, an 82-year-old friend and client of Gruenke, had loaned her a significant amount of money including money to start a reflexology clinic. They lived together for a time in a platonic relationship - he had even put her in his will - until he began to make advances to her, at which point she moved home with her mother. Barnett's advances became more aggressive, to the point where she and her boyfriend plotted to kill him. One night in November 1986, she met with Barnett in his car and a fight broke out. She and her boyfriend beat Barnett to death. Greunke, distraught, then spoke to a pastor and counselor about her involvement in the murder, and the planning that went into it. At trial the conversation between Greunke, the counselor, and pastor was admitted and proved sufficient to convict Gruenke of first degree murder. Opinion of the Court The Court found that the trial judge was correct in admitting the evidence. Lamer C.J., writing for the majority, noted that Canadian law does not recognize privilege in religious communications; however, there may be situations where such a privilege may be required. To accommodate this need the Court adopted a four-step test proposed by American jurist John Henry Wigmore to determine whether privilege is required. # the communications must originate in a confidence that they will not be disclosed; # this element of confidentiality must be essential to the full and satisfactory maintenance of the relation between the parties; # the relation must be one which in the opinion of the community ought to be sedulously fostered; and # the injury that would inure to the relation by the disclosure of the communications must be greater than the benefit thereby gained for the correct disposal of litigation. In application to the facts of the case, Lamer found that they did not meet the requirements of the Wigmore test and so the communication was not privileged.

Established on 1 January 1966, MAC was the primary strategic airlift organization of the Air Force until 1974, when Air Force tactical airlift units in the Tactical Air Command (TAC) were merged into MAC to create a unified airlift organization. In 1982, the heritage of the World War II Air Transport Command (ATC) (1942-1948) and the postwar Military Air Transport Service (MATS) (1948-1966) were consolidated with MAC, providing a continuous history of long range airlift. Inactivated on 1 June 1992, most of MAC's personnel and equipment were reassigned to the new Air Mobility Command (AMC), with a smaller portion divided between U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and the newly created Air Education and Training Command (AETC). The heritage of MAC (and its predecessor organizations) was officially consolidated into AMC in 2016.Dreyer, MSgt Kristine. \\"AMC consolidates with MAC\\". Air Mobility Command Public Affairs. Retrieved October 7, 2016. Military Air Transport Service :See: Military Air Transport Service for history of organization prior to 1 January 1966 MAC was the USAF successor organization to the Department of Defense's Military Air Transport Service (MATS), with MATS having been disestablished on 8 January 1966. MAC's emblem reflected its predecessor's history by incorporating the globe-wings- arrows emblem of MATS into its shield. Although MATS was under the operational control of the United States Air Force, the 4-digit USAF Military Air Transport Service units at all levels were considered major command (MAJCOM) provisional units by USAF due to MATS being a Department of Defense Unified Command. Under the USAF lineage system, they did not possess a permanent lineage or history and were discontinued upon inactivation. AFCON (HQ Air Force-controlled) units were activated under MAC, to which USAF personnel and equipment formerly assigned to MATS MAJCOM units were reassigned effective 8 January 1966. No formal lineage or history between former MATS MAJCOM units and MAC AFCON units was ever made. With the establishment of MAC by the USAF, plans were also made to discontinue the role of the United States Navy within the new command. MATS' shore-based naval air transport squadrons (VR) were assigned back to the Navy upon its inaction, most being converted to organic Operational Support Airlift (OSA) roles for the Navy and renamed as fleet logistics support squadrons, primarily residing in the Naval Air Reserve. However, some naval aircrews formerly assigned to MATS continued to fly USAF C-130Es for MAC until 1968, when all MAC C-130s were transferred to Tactical Air Command as part of the theater troop carrier mission being reassigned. In addition, MAC continued the missions of several other activities formerly under MATS: the Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service (ARRS); Air Weather Service (ARS); Special Air Mission (SAM); Air Photographic and Charting Service (ACIC) (Reassigned to the Defense Mapping Agency in 1972), and Aeromedical Transport Wing (AMTW). In addition to these organizations, MAC supported select USAF Special Operations forces originally organized under MATS on an as-required basis until 1984, when all USAF Special Operations under Tactical Air Command (TAC) were transferred to MAC's 23rd Air Force (23AF). USAF Special Operations forces remained part of MAC until the establishment of the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) in 1990.MATS, MAC and AMC History = Vietnam Era (1966–1975) = Brand-new 63d MAW C-141As on the ramp at Norton AFB, 1967.

Established at the height of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War, MAC provided long-range strategic airlift from bases in the United States to Military Airlift Support Squadrons (MASS) located on Pacific Air Forces bases in the Pacific AOR.

At first, MAC transports to Vietnam landed regularly only at Tan Son Nhut AB, necessitating considerable transshipment within Vietnam by the Common Service Airlift System. New air bases opened at Da Nang AB and Cam Ranh AB in January 1966, and later at Pleiku, Bien Hoa and Phu Cat Air Bases, reducing the need for redistribution.The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia: Tactical Airlift, Ray L. Bowers, 1983.; Department of the Air Force History office Major unit movements by MAC aircraft from the United States usually required further airlifts to operating areas by in-country transports. Introduction of the C-5 Galaxy transport in the summer of 1970 created new problems of in-country distribution, since C-5 deliveries were massive, and, initially the planes could land only at Cam Ranh Bay. Eventually, however, C-5s could unload at Tan Son Nhut and elsewhere. Primarily, MAC transports carried high-value cargo such as aircraft and equipment parts, while MAC civilian-contract flights transported passengers to and from the combat zone. In the winter of 1965-66, MAC conducted Operation \\"Blue Light,\\" the deployment of elements of the 25th Infantry Division from Hickam AFB, Hawaii to Pleiku, South Vietnam. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, MAC transports airlifted additional troops from the 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to South Vietnam, supporting a buildup of forces in South Korea in response to the seizure of the United States Navy intelligence-gathering ship USS Pueblo (AGER-2) by North Korea in January 1968. Undoubtedly the most important development of MAC during the Vietnam War was the use of the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter as an airborne ambulance evacuating casualties out of South Vietnam to hospitals in Japan, the Philippines and the United States. Generally, patients requiring hospitalization for thirty days or more were moved to offshore hospitals; others were sometimes evacuated to keep an empty- bed reserve of fifty percent in Vietnam. Military Airlift Command transports carried the more serious cases from Clark AB to the United States, and, in 1966, began making patient pickups in Vietnam.  1972 Easter Offensive  On 30 March 1972, North Vietnam launched an all-out invasion of South Vietnam, which came to be known as the Easter Offensive. The \\"Vietnamization\\" policy of the United States had resulted in the vast majority of US ground combat forces been withdrawn from South Vietnam with PACAF's tactical air units also being reduced. Military Airlift Command's C-141 force, accustomed to operating in and out of Vietnam from offshore were utilized for movement of large numbers of men and amounts of materiel to oppose the invasion. Beginning on 21 April, MAC C-141s began shuttling passengers and cargo between Tan Son Nhut AB and the other main in-country bases, principally Da Nang AB, Bien Hoa AB, and Pleiku AB. Planes and crews were based for one or more nights at Tan Son Nhut and performed two or more days of in-country work before departing for offshore destinations. This C-141 effort permitted the VNAF and PACAF C-130s to concentrate on drops, unit hauls, and deliveries to forward locations. The rapid American response to the invasion allowed the South Vietnamese forces to defeat the invaders for the moment.  Operation Homecoming  C-141B, AF Ser.

Recently released United States POWs from North Vietnamese prison camps being flown on board the \\"Hanoi Taxi\\" from Hanoi, North Vietnam to Clark Air Base, Philippines, March 1973. By the terms of the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, the cease-fire was to become effective in Vietnam the morning of 28 January 1973, Saigon time. American prisoners in North Vietnam were to be released and the last 23,700 American troops withdrawn from Vietnam within sixty days. Planning for Operation Homecoming, the mission for the return of Americans held by North Vietnam, was given to the Military Airlift Command. C-141s of the 63d Military Airlift Wing, stationed at Norton AFB, California were given responsibility for bringing out the men. On 11 February, two C-130s of TAC's 374th Tactical Airlift Wing flew from Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan to Clark AB as primary and spare ships for the movement of the support team to Hanoi the next day. A second C-130 left Tan Son Nhut AB carrying members of the international commission to Hanoi to oversee the repatriations. This C-130 arrived at Gia Lam Airport about one hour before the C-130 from Ching Chuan Kang arrived. On the ground at Gia Lam, the C-130 crew met the airport manager and went indoors for tea offered by the North Vietnamese. The first of three C-141s flown in from Clark landed soon after and repatriation began. As the first returnee moved from the release desk, one of the C-130 flight engineers quickly moved to clear the way, leading the former prisoner by the arm. Taking the cue, the other C-130 crewmen in the same way escorted each man to the waiting C-141. Over and over, returnees expressed their deepest appreciation at having been greeted by a \\"brother-in-arms\\" and, in those first few moments of freedom, welcomed home by their own kind. A total of 116 Americans were released at Gia Lam that day and all were flown to Clark by the C-141s. Further releases of Americans in Hanoi followed the pattern of the first day. Releases took place on 18 February and on seven dates in March, ending with the final repatriation of the last sixty-seven men on 29 March 1973.  Fall of South Vietnam  With the impending Fall of Saigon and the evacuation of American nationals from South Vietnam in April 1975, the Air Force started evacuation flights out of Tan Son Nhut AB. Operation Babylift, the airlift of some two thousand mixed-blood orphans and children of American servicemen and Vietnamese women, most of them destined for homes in the United States, was initiated. Unfortunately, the Babylift missions were marred by the crash of a MAC C-5A shortly after takeoff on 4 April, killing 155 persons, most of them children. Most of the American and some Vietnamese refugees departed openly aboard military or contract-jet transports, but a few individuals formerly associated with intelligence activities came out semi-covertly through the Air America terminal. On two days, 21 and 22 April, sixty-four hundred persons left Tan Son Nhut for Clark AB aboard thirty-three C-141s and forty-one C-130s. Operations were around-the-clock, the C-141s landing by day and the C-130s generally by night. Other C-141s and the contract carriers meanwhile moved those refugees already at Clark eastward to Guam and Wake Island. Nearly all aircrews reported tracer fire and airbursts with some bursts reaching to eighteen-thousand feet. On 26 and 27 April, twelve-thousand persons left Tan Son Nhut for Clark AB aboard forty-six C-130 and twenty-eight C-141 flights. The intensifying enemy fire forced the decision to stop C-141 landings at Saigon at nightfall on the twenty-seventh, while C-130 flights continued. On 29 April all US fixed-wing evacuation flights from Tan Son Nhut were stopped due to North Vietnamese artillery fire. MAC subsequently supported Operation New Life (April 1975 – September 1975), the transport to Guam of Vietnamese refugees and their subsequent resettlement. = Special Air Mission = VC-135B Stratolifter, AF Ser. No. 62-4126, used for VIP transport parked on the flight line at Andrews AFB, Maryland Inherited from MATS, MAC assumed the Special Air Mission (SAM) of providing global airlift, logistics, aerial port and communications for the President, Vice President, and senior government leaders as tasked by the White House and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. The 89th Military Airlift Wing, stationed at Andrews AFB, Maryland carried out this mission on a worldwide basis. = Operation Nickel Grass = The 1973 Arab-Israeli War drained Israel's military of munitions and other consumables. One of the most critical but least celebrated airlifts in history unfolded over a desperate 32 days in the fall of 1973. Operation Nickel Grass was the United States' effort to ship thousands of tons of materiel over vast distances into the midst of the most ferocious fighting the Middle East had ever witnessed. MAC C-141 and C-5 airlifters in harm's way, vulnerable to attack from fighters, as they carved a demanding track across the Mediterranean, and to missiles and sabotage, as they were off-loading in Israel.Nickel Grass, by Walter J. Boyne. Air Force magazine, December 1998 Vol. 81, No. 12 The airlift had been a key to the Israeli victory. It had not only brought about the timely resupply of the Israeli armed forces but also provided a series of deadly new weapons put to good use in the latter part of the war. These included the AGM-65 Maverick, the BGM-71 TOW anti-tank weapons and extensive new electronic countermeasures equipment that warded off successful attacks on Israeli fighters. Reflecting on the operation's vital contribution to the war effort, Reader's Digest would call it \\"The Airlift That Saved Israel.\\"Two O'clock War: The 1973 Yom Kippur Conflict and the Airlift that Saved Israel. New York: Reader's Digest Press, 1976. The airlift taught the Air Force many lessons, large and small. With refueling denied for MAC airlift flights bound for Israel by France and West Germany, Lajes Field in the Azores was forced to be utilized instead. The Air Force established an immediate requirement for aerial refueling to become standard practice in MAC so that its airlifters could operate without forward bases, if necessary. C-5A (AF Ser. No. 69-0009) of the 60 MAW, Travis AFB, California, circa 1973 The C-5 Galaxy proved to be one of the finest military airlift aircraft in history, not the expensive military mistake as it had been portrayed in the media. Since its introduction in 1970, the C-5A had been plagued by problems. The Air Force claimed to have rectified the problems, but the C-5A was still viewed by the press as an expensive failure. During Nickel Grass, C-5s carried 48% of the total cargo in only 145 of the 567 total missions. The C-5A also carried \\"outsize\\" cargo such as M60 Patton tanks, M109 howitzers, ground radar systems, mobile tractor units, CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters, and A-4 Skyhawk components; cargo that could not fit in smaller aircraft. This performance justified the C-5's existence, and allowed the Air Force to move forward with their proposed upgrade to the C-5B variant. = Tactical Airlift = C-130E Hercules, AF Ser. No 62-1819 It was found during the Vietnam War that there was a large duplication of aerial port facilities and mission objectives between MAC, Tactical Air Command (TAC) and Pacific Air Forces (PACAF). A study group recommended the consolidation of all tactical airlift forces as a cost-saving measure under MAC. On 1 December 1974, all TAC C-130 Tactical Airlift Wings were reassigned to MAC. In 1975, PACAF and USAFE Tactical Airlift Wings were also reassigned to MAC, thus ending the theater troop carrier mission as it had existed since the beginning of World War II. As a result, MAC became the controlling Major Command for C-130 wings at Little Rock and Pope AFB and the 433 TAW at Kelly AFB became a MAC tenant unit. With the impending arrival of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing (1 TFW) from MacDill AFB and their standup of USAF's first F-15 Eagle aircraft at Langley AFB, the 316 TAW at Langley was inactivated in 1975 with one squadron from the 316th reassigned to the 62d MAW at McChord AFB and the rest of the wing's aircraft reassigned throughout MAC, AFRES and the Air National Guard. MAC also assumed command of Tactical Airlift Wings at Clark AB (374 TAW) in the Pacific and the 513 TAW at RAF Mildenhall and the 435 TAW at Rhein-Main AB in Europe, with these MAC overseas wings becoming tenant units under PACAF and USAFE. = C-141/C-5 Upgrade Programs = During the Vietnam War era, the C-141A was found to \\"bulk out\\" (e.g., exceeded max cubic foot in the cargo bay) before it \\"massed out\\" (e.g., exceeded max gross weight of cargo in the cargo bay), meaning that it often had additional lift capacity that went wasted because the cargo hold was too full. To correct the perceived deficiencies of the original model and utilize the C-141 to the fullest of its capabilities, the entire fleet of 270 in-service C-141As were stretched, adding needed payload volume.C-141 Starlifter Narrative , Office of MAC History, Military Airlift Command, 1973 These modified aircraft were designated C-141B. Additional 'plug' sections were added before and after the wings, lengthening the fuselage by 23 ft 4 in (7.11 m) and allowing the carriage of 103 litters for wounded, 13 standard pallets, 205 troops, 168 paratroopers, or an equivalent increase in other loads. Also added at this time was a boom receptacle for inflight refueling which gave the C-141 truly intercontinental range. The conversion program took place between 1977 and 1982, with first delivery taking place in December 1979. It was estimated that this stretching program was the equivalent of buying 90 new aircraft, in terms of increased capacity.Norton, Bill. Lockheed Martin C-5 Galaxy, Specialty Press, 2003. . During its development phase, problems with the C-5 had been discovered, including structural problems that required the replacement of wing sections. During the early 1980s, the C-5A force was retrofitted with a new wing to strengthen the aircraft and allow it to carry additional cargo loads. Also, a shortage of airlift capability was addressed with the introduction of the C-5B, The first C-5B incorporating significant improvements such as strengthened wings and updated avionics was delivered to Altus Air Force Base in January 1986. C-5B production concluded with delivery of the last \\"B\\" model aircraft in April 1989. A third C-5 variant, the C-5C was developed for transporting large cargo. Two C-5As (68-0213 and 68-0216) were modified to have a larger internal cargo capacity to accommodate large payloads, such as satellites for use by NASA and the National Reconnaissance Office. = Cold War Operations = The United States Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force (RDJTF) of the early 1980s led to this prototype desert scheme shown on this Little Rock AFB-based C-130E, AF Ser.

No. 66-0386 After the Vietnam War ended, MAC returned to a training role, though it continued to operate the worldwide route structure to support United States interests around the world. With the tactical airlift mission now part of MAC, emphasis on tactical operations was increased. While C-130s were assigned an increased logistical role C-141 and C-5 crews were given training in tactical procedures as more emphasis was placed on deployment.  NATO Support  In addition to the forces in the Pacific, MAC operated air transshipment facilities on USAFE bases in the European and North African AORs. These were: * Wheelus Air Base, Libya, (623d MASS) (Closed 1969) * Torrejon Air Base, Spain, (625th MASS) * RAF Mildenhall, England, (627th MASS) * Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, (628th MASS) * Hellenikon Air Base, Greece, (629th MASS) * Rhein-Main Air Base, West Germany, (630th MASS) : Ramstein Air Base, West Germany, (Det. 1, 630th MASS) * Lajes Field, Azores, (1605th MASS) Annual Exercise REFORGER deployments of United States Army forces to West Germany was intended to ensure that NATO had the ability to quickly deploy forces to West Germany in the event of a conflict with the Soviet Union. MAC C-5 and C-141 aircraft transported entire units of Army infantry, artillery and mechanized personnel yearly after some forces were withdrawn back to the United States. Reforger was conducted annually until just after the end of the Cold War. In addition, Operation Bright Star deployment airlifts to Egypt, beginning in 1981 were flown by MAC C-5 and C-141 aircraft. Bright Star was a series of biennial combined and joint training exercises by American and Egyptian forces. These deployments were designed to strengthen ties between the Egyptian and American militaries and demonstrate and enhance the ability of the Americans to reinforce their allies in the Middle East in the event of war.  Operation Urgent Fury  In 1983 the United States invaded the tiny island of Grenada. Code-named Operation Urgent Fury, the invasion tasked MAC for planning a military combat operation using its tactical M/C-130 wings. Though the outcome of the conflict was assured, many problems occurred during the assault. There was confusion among the initial assault force of special operations MC-130s and conventional airlifter C-130s, confusion that resulted in a lightly armed force of US Army Ranger headquarters troops parachuting onto the airfield at Point Salines without their heavier weapons. Once the airfield was secured, C-141s began landing with 82nd Airborne Division paratroopers to reinforce the Rangers.  Operation Just Cause  During Christmas Week 1989, MAC transports dropped paratroopers onto key military points in Panama after a US serviceman was killed by Panamanian soldiers. Operation Just Cause, the United States invasion of Panama saw MAC C-141s being flown performing an Army combat parachute drop. The drop formation included C-130s as well as C-141s. The US forces quickly overwhelmed the Panamanian military and soon captured the Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, and brought him to the United States to stand trial.  Special Operations  Lockheed C-130A-LM Hercules, AF Serial No. 54-1637, of the 7406th Operations Squadron. This aircraft was later converted to GC-130A. It is now at Goodfellow AFB as ground trainer. Special Operations Squadron Beginning in World War II, special operations utilizing transport aircraft were a part of the USAAF mission. Troop Carrier Command (TCC) C-47 squadrons worked with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Europe, Asia and other regions flying clandestine missions behind enemy lines.Thigpen, Jerry L. (2001). The Praetorian STARShip: The untold story of the Combat Talon. Air University Press, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. ASIN: B000116LSI In the 1950s, the MATS Air Resupply And Communications Service (ARCS) controlled special operations forces during the Korean War and throughout the 1950s supporting both DoD as well as CIA activities. MATS worked closely with the USAF Special Air Warfare Center (later, USAF Special Operations Force) in the 1960s and early years of the Vietnam War. After 1964, Special Operations were assigned to Tactical Air Command's Ninth Air Force, and when the war in Vietnam ended, the special operations forces were cut back along with the rest of the military. The ill-fated Operation Eagle Claw Iranian rescue mission in April 1980 led to a resurgence of emphasis on long-range special operations teams whose mission would be primarily to conduct operations such as the rescue of hostages. A new special operations force was created under the Ninth Air Force, and based at Hurlburt Field, Florida, but the mission soon transferred to the Military Airlift Command where it became the Twenty-Third Air Force on 10 February 1983. Twenty-Third Air Force units both in Europe (Rhein-Main Air Base, RAF Mildenhall) and Japan (Yokota Air Base supported various clandestine missions throughout the 1980s, flying specially-equipped MC-130s. =Special Operations Divestiture= On 22 May 1990, Twenty-Third Air Force was redesignated as Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC) and elevated to the major command (MAJCOM) level, with all Air Force special operations aircraft, installations and personnel, to include those \\"operationally-gained\\" special operations aircraft, installations and personnel in the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, transferred to AFSOC. = Gulf War = As a response to the Iraq invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, President Bush responded by dispatching American armed forces to Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom and the oilfields vital to the western industrial nations. The 82nd Airborne Division began moving by air from its base at Fort Bragg, North Carolina to the Saudi desert. MAC's entire force of C-141s and C-5s was dedicated to the airlift, including Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard aircraft and crews who were called to active duty. MAC C-130s were deployed to Saudi Arabia to support the arriving ground forces as they arrived in-country by air and by ship. Fortunately, Iraq made no move against Saudi Arabia, and the United States and an international coalition was able to build up a massive military force that eventually drove the Iraqis out of Kuwait. = Inactivation = With the end of the Cold War the Air Force reorganized its command structure. A lesson learned from the 1990 Gulf War was that the division of forces as then existed in the USAF led to confusion in actual combat operations. The emphasis on rapid force deployment led the Air Force to reorganize its major commands, with MAC being inactivated on 1 June 1992. Most of the personnel and equipment formerly assigned to MAC was absorbed by the new Air Mobility Command (AMC), which was activated the same day. AMC also assumed control of most of the former Strategic Air Command (SAC) aerial refueling fleet that same day, to include all KC-10 Extender aircraft and most KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft, the only exceptions being those KC-135s that were transferred to U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) and Air Education and Training Command (AETC). =Lineage= ;

It took place on January 24, 1847, during the Taos Revolt, a conflict of the Mexican–American War. Background Insurgents, Mexicans and Pueblo Indians in New Mexico under the leadership of Chavez, Montoya, Lafoya and Ortiz, assembled a large force at La Canada, intending to march onto the American-held city of Santa Fe.Hughes, J.T., 1847, Doniphan's Expedition, Cincinnati: U.P. James They would be intercepted by the American garrison of Santa Fe, resulting in the battle. Colonel Sterling Price, commander of the U.S. forces in Santa Fe, heard of this insurgent movement on 20 Jan., having intercepted letters from the rebels, and assembled a force of 353 soldiers and militia to march north on 23 Jan., and intercept them. Price's force included Capt. McMillin's Company D, Capt. Williams' Company K, Capt. Lack's Company L, Capt. Halley's Company M, and Capt. Barber's Company N, 2d Regiment Missouri Mounted Volunteers, Capt. Agney's battalion of infantry and Capt. St. Vrain's Sante Fe volunteers, and Lt. A.B. Dyer's four mounted howitzers, while Lt. Col. Willock remained behind in command of the capital. Battle On 24 Jan., Price met the large insurgent force on the heights along the road to Santa Cruz de la Cañada and three strong houses at the base of the hill. Price placed his artillery on the left to fire on the houses and bluff, placed his dismounted men such that they were protected by the stream bluff, and sent Capt. St. Vrain to protect his wagon train a mile to the rear until it joined him. Price ordered Capt. Agney to dislodge the rebels occupying the house opposite his right flank, followed by a charge up the hill, supported by Lt. White and Capt. St. Vrain. Capt.s McMillen's, Barber's and Slack's men took possession of the houses enclosed by a strong corral. Price reported, \\"In a few minutes my troops had dislodged the enemy at all points, and they were flying in every direction.\\" Aftermath Tafoya was killed, Chavez was later killed at Taos Pueblo, and Montoya was later caught and hanged at Don Fernando (today's Town of Taos, NM). Price camped on the field that night while the rebels retreated to Taos. On 29 Jan., Price met the insurgents at the Battle of Embudo Pass.

It was one of the last major battles of the November Uprising and the last major offensive for the Poles.  Background  Following the battle of Grochów of 25 February, the Russian advance under General Hans Karl von Diebitsch through Praga did not occur, and he decided to cross Vistula river south of the city trying to take it \\"from land\\". The Poles, numbering some 4,000 men (both bayonettes and sabres) and 16 cannons advanced rapidly towards the town of Siedlce, a major Russian munitions depot. On 10 April 1831 the Poles encountered forces of Gen. Grigorij Rosen in the village of Iganie, several miles west of Siedlce, at the Muchawka river.  Description  Prądzyński, believing the remainder of the Polish forces would arrive shortly, decided to assault the Russians with his avant garde only. The mounted artillery units under Gen. Józef Bem took advantage of its mobility and successfully shelled the village of Iganie defended by Russian infantry. This allowed for the Polish infantry led by Prądzyński himself to recapture the village. After the initial surprise, the Russian forces under General Geismar managed to regroup across the river and started shelling the Poles with their artillery, much superior in numbers. Seeing the numerical inferiority of the Poles, the Russian commander ordered the artillery barrage to stop and the infantry to charge the Polish positions from across the river. However, shortly after the Russians entered the combat, the combined forces of Prądzyński's infantry and Gen. Ludwik Kicki's cavalry managed to cut the Russians from their rear and seize the sole bridge above the river. Due to Russia superiority in fire power the success was short-living, although Poles managed to inflict heavy casualty on Rosen's Observational Corps. Rosen, who arrived back from his meeting with Diebitsch in the middle of the battle, ordered Geismar to continue with commanding the troops.  Aftermath  The Polish commander in chief General Jan Skrzynecki who arrived at the battlefield later that day opposed the idea of another push on Russian forces, thus Poles for the second time after the Battle of Dębe Wielkie did not achieve their main objective — to cut Diebitsch's main supply lines, and because of that the Polish effort was somewhat useless.

It is traditionally made of tomatoes, hard-boiled eggs, Niçoise olives and anchovies or tuna, dressed with olive oil. It has been popular worldwide since the early 20th century, and has been prepared and discussed by many chefs. Delia Smith called it \\"one of the best combinations of salad ingredients ever invented\\" and Gordon Ramsay said that \\"it must be the finest summer salad of all\\". It can be served either as a composed salad or as a tossed salad. Freshly cooked or canned tuna may be added. For decades, traditionalists and innovators have disagreed over which ingredients should be included; traditionalists exclude cooked vegetables. The salad may include raw red peppers, shallots, artichoke hearts and other seasonal raw vegetables. Raw green beans harvested in the spring, when they are still young and crisp, may be included. However, cooked green beans and potatoes are commonly served in variations of salade niçoise that are popular around the world. Traditional recipe and its defenders A simple salade niçoise in the 19th-century style, made of tomatoes, anchovies and olive oil The version known in Nice in the late 19th century was a basic combination of tomatoes, anchovies and olive oil, described as \\"simple food for poor people\\". Over time, other fresh and mostly raw ingredients were added to the salad as served in Nice. A 1903 recipe by Henri Heyraud in a book called La Cuisine à Nice included tomatoes, anchovies, artichokes, olive oil, red peppers and black olives, but excluded tuna and lettuce. The dressing included olive oil, vinegar, mustard and fines herbes. Former Nice mayor and cookbook author Jacques Médecin was a strict salad traditionalist. His 1972 cookbook Cuisine Nicoise: Recipes from a Mediterranean Kitchen called for the salad to be served in a wooden bowl rubbed with garlic, and excluded boiled vegetables: \\"never, never, I beg you, include boiled potato or any other boiled vegetable in your salade niçoise.\\" Médecin wrote that the salad should be made \\"predominately of tomatoes\\" which should be \\"salted three times and moistened with olive oil\\". Hard-boiled eggs were added, and either anchovies or canned tuna, but not both. He incorporated raw vegetables such as cucumbers, purple artichokes, green peppers, fava beans, spring onions, black olives, basil and garlic, but no lettuce or vinegar. According to Rowley Leigh, Médecin believed that salade niçoise \\"was a product of the sun and had to be vibrant with the crisp, sweet flavours of the vegetables of the Midi.\\" Médecin advocated presenting the dish as a composed salad, commenting, \\"As the various ingredients that go into salade niçoise are of bright and contrasting colours, they can be arranged most decoratively in the salad bowl.\\" An organization called Cercle de la Capelina d’Or, led for many years by Renée Graglia until her death in 2013, continues to protest against deviation from traditional local recipes. The group, which certifies restaurants in Nice, sticks with Médecin's standards. They reject commonly included ingredients such as green beans and potatoes, as well as innovations such as including sweetcorn, mayonnaise, shallots and lemon. In 2016, French Michelin-starred chef Hélène Darroze posted a salade niçoise recipe on Facebook that included cooked potatoes and green beans. According to journalist Mathilde Frénois, the reaction on Facebook was quick and hostile from the \\"purists\\". Darroze's version was called \\"a massacre of the recipe\\", a \\"sacrilege\\", and a violation of the \\"ancestral traditions\\" of the salad. She was warned that it is \\"dangerous to innovate\\". Variations A non-traditional salade niçoise incorporating cooked potatoes and green beans, topped with seared tuna and garnished with anchovies The question of the proper ingredients appropriate for a salade niçoise has long been the subject of debate and even controversy. The British cook Nigella Lawson observed \\"Everyone seems to have a very strong opinion as to what should or should not go into a Salade Niçoise\\". Chef and cookbook author Auguste Escoffier (1846–1935), born in Villeneuve-Loubet near Nice, added potatoes and green beans, an innovation that remains controversial as a \\"questionable idea\\" a century later. Salade niçoise has been known in the United States since at least the 1920s, when a cookbook for hotel chefs included two variations. The first was vegetarian, was dressed with mayonnaise, and included lettuce, tomatoes, potatoes, stringless beans and pimento-stuffed olives, while the second version was a composed salad, including the same ingredients, plus anchovies. A 1941 U.S. version by chef Louis Diat of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel included the anchovies, was dressed with vinaigrette, and added capers. The highly influential 1961 American cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, included a recipe that incorporated a potato salad, green beans, both tuna and anchovies and a vinaigrette dressing. Co-author Julia Child later demonstrated the recipe on her television show, The French Chef, in 1970. A recipe was included in Prosper Montagné's Larousse Gastronomique in 1938. It called for \\"equal parts diced potatoes and French beans. Season with oil, vinegar, salt and pepper. Mix with anchovy fillets, olives and capers. Garnish with quartered tomatoes.\\" French chef Paul Bocuse included a vegetarian version of the salad, garnished with chopped onion and chervil, in the 1977 English translation of his cookbook. A 1979 variation by Pierre Franey is called Salade Niçoise aux Poires d'Avocat. Franey wrote, \\"I am convinced that had avocados been native to Provence they would have been an inevitable ingredient in the celebrated salad of that region, the salad niçoise.\\" This version also included mushrooms and both black and green olives. Claudia Roden is an advocate of innovation, and observed in 1984 that \\"There are not one or two or three versions of salade Nicoise — but dozens, depending on what is available.\\" In 1984, James Beard created a version incorporating rice for an Uncle Ben's advertising campaign. In 1991, Jacques Pépin wrote an article that called the inclusion of canned tuna the \\"conventional choice\\", and recommended sauteed fresh tuna instead as \\"more elegant\\". Mimi Sheraton disagrees, commenting, \\"Salade Nicoise with fresh tuna is a travesty . . . if you like it, you are wrong!\\" In 1999, Pépin joined with Julia Child in a TV series, Jacques and Julia: Cooking at Home. Each prepared a salad they called \\"Near Nicoise\\". Child's version was a composed salad including tuna and anchovies canned in olive oil, and blanched green beans. Pépin's was a tossed salad including sauteed fresh tuna and potatoes. Many chefs have developed variations using seafood other than anchovies or tuna. Ina Garten, Jamie Oliver and Rachael Ray have published variations using salmon as the fish component. Bobby Flay has published variations incorporating shrimp and swordfish both of which he describes as \\"Nicoise\\" in quotation marks. Sara Moulton also has a recipe incorporating shrimp. Instead of a conventional salad dressing, she uses an Italian tuna sauce. A wide variety of seafoods can be used in non-traditional variations, with San Francisco chef Jay Harlow commenting, \\"Mackerel, and even milder fish like rockfish, cod or halibut are also delicious served this way, as are good canned sardines.\\" Nigella Lawson has published a quick recipe that substitutes croutons for potatoes. Cat Cora has published a variation that presents the salad as a lettuce wrap. Emeril Lagasse has a recipe that uses a mayonnaise based creamy Parmesan dressing, and incorporates grilled Yellowfin tuna loin along with Picholine olives in addition to the traditional black olives. Guy Fieri has a recipe that incorporates couscous and mushrooms. Sandra Lee has a version that includes tuna steaks stuffed with olive tapenade. Mark Bittman has a variation that incorporates farro. Notable chefs Many other chefs and food writers have written recipes for the salad. Among them are Daniel Boulud, Anthony Bourdain, Melissa d'Arabian, Hélène Darroze, Tyler Florence, Simon Hopkinson, Robert Irvine, Gordon Ramsay, Nigel Slater, Delia Smith, Martha Stewart, Michael Symon and Alice Waters.

In his rookie year, Jenkins played all 18 games and rushed for 1,050 rushing yards with two touchdowns and had 400 yards receiving. Upon the season's completion, he was voted the team's rookie of the year. With his small size and his large rushing numbers, comparisons between Jenkins and his head coach Pinball Clemons (who was a star running back during his playing days) naturally emerged. During the 2001 season, Jenkins set an Argonauts team record for most rushing yards in a season with 1484 rushing yards on 271 carries and 8 touchdowns as well as 361 receiving yards and 5 touchdowns. Earlier in the season, there was great concern by the fans over whether Jenkins' running abilities would have been stifled because of the \\"pass-happy\\" philosophy of offensive co-ordinator John Jenkins. However, head coach Clemons put his coaching authority to use and called for a more balanced offensive attack combining the pass and running games to better utilize Michael Jenkins' game. The Football Reporters of Canada selected Jenkins as the winner of the 2001 John Candy Memorial Award, which is given to the Toronto Argonauts player of the year.\\"John Candy Memorial Award Winners.\\" www.argonauts.ca. Retrieved December 16, 2014. Jenkins left the Argonauts in 2002 to sign with the Houston Texans, where he spent the season as a member of the team's practice squad, and he returned to the Argonauts in 2003. Unfortunately, he was not able to regain the form that he had when he first joined the team. After coming back from the NFL, Jenkins' weight increased. That, combined with an abductor/groin injury in the pre-season, and recurring ankle injuries factored into his decreased productivity. Despite those shortcomings throughout the season, Jenkins rushed for 195 yards in a game vs. the Edmonton Eskimos on August 17, 2003 and earned the CFL offensive player of the week award for the achievement. For the season, Jenkins rushed for 814 yards on 156 carries with 6 rushing touchdowns, along with 316 yards receiving. Shortly thereafter, he had surgery on his injured ankles that hampered him during the season. Injury and Return to Football On May 17, 2004, Jenkins was released by the Argonauts, less than a month after the team signed free agent running back John Avery. Months later, Jenkins' agent, Danny Benjamin, alleged that his client would miss the entire 2004 CFL season because of the injured ankles and that the injury would not have been that serious had Jenkins not have gotten bad advice from Toronto's female trainer, Erin Brooks. Benjamin said \\"I have a problem with female trainers because they're female and they don't understand the male body.

Glass fusing is the joining together of pieces of glass at high temperature, usually in a kiln. This is usually done roughly between and , and can range from tack fusing at lower temperatures, in which separate pieces of glass stick together but still retain their individual shapes, to full fusing at higher ones, in which separate pieces merge smoothly into one another.  History  While the precise origins of glass fusing techniques are not known with certainty, there is archeological evidence that the Egyptians were familiar with techniques ca. 2000 BCE.Gil Reynolds: The Fused Glass Handbook. Hidden Valley Books; Scottsdale, Arizona 1987, Although this date is generally accepted by researchers, some historians argue that the earliest fusing techniques were first developed by the Romans, who were much more prolific glassworkers.Boyce Lundstrom: Kiln Firing Glass. Vitreous Publications; Colton, Oregon 1983, Fusing was the primary method of making small glass objects for approximately 2,000 years, until the development of the glass blowpipe. Glassblowing largely supplanted fusing due to its greater efficiency and utility. While glass working in general enjoyed a revival during the Renaissance, fusing was largely ignored during this period. Fusing began to regain popularity in the early part of the 20th century, particularly in the U.S. during the 1960s. Modern glass fusing is a widespread hobby but the technique is also gaining popularity in the world of fine art. Compatibility Disparate pieces of glass must be compatible in order to ensure they can be fused properly. It is a common misconception that glasses having the same coefficient of expansion (COE) will be compatible. Coefficient of expansion is one indicator that glasses may be compatible, but there are many other factors that determine whether glasses are compatible. If incompatible glasses are fused together, it is unlikely that the fused piece will be able maintain structural integrity. The piece may shatter during the cooling process, or develop stress originating from the point of contact between the incompatible glasses over time, leading to fractures within the glass, and eventually breakage. Generally, kiln-glass manufacturers will rate their glasses for compatibility with other glasses they make. In order to be certain that the glasses they use will be compatible, many glass fusers will adopt one manufacturer's glasses to use exclusively. The stress in two pieces of incompatible glass that were fused can be observed by placing the item between two polarizing filters. This will show areas of tension which will develop stress and fracture over time.  Techniques  Most contemporary fusing methods involve stacking, or layering thin sheets of glass, often using different colors to create patterns or simple images. The stack is then placed inside the kiln (which is almost always electric, but can be heated by gas or wood) and then heated through a series of ramps (rapid heating) and soaks (holding the temperature at a specific point) until the separate pieces begin to bond together. The longer the kiln is held at the maximum temperature, the more thoroughly the stack will fuse, eventually softening and rounding the edges of the original shape. Once the desired effect has been achieved at the maximum desired temperature, the kiln temperature will be brought down quickly through the temperature range of to to avoid devitrification. The glass is then allowed to cool slowly over a specified time, soaking at specified temperature ranges which are essential to the annealing process. This prevents uneven cooling and breakage and produces a strong finished product. This cooling takes place normally for a period of 10–12 hours in 3 stages. The first stage- the rapid cool period is meant to place the glass into the upper end of the annealing range . The second stage- the anneal soak at is meant to equalize the temperature at the core and the surface of the glass at relieving the stress between those areas. The last stage, once all areas have had time to reach a consistent temperature, is the final journey to room temperature. The kiln is slowly brought down over the course of 2 hours to , soaked for 2 hours at , down again to which ends the firing schedule. The glass will remain in the closed kiln until the pyrometer reads room temperature. Note that these temperatures are not hard and fast rules. Depending on the kiln, the size of the project, the number of layers, the desired finished look, and even the brand of glass, ramp and soak temperatures and times may vary. Small pendants can be fired and cooled very rapidly. For instance, small glass pieces can be fired in as little as one hour.  Finished products  Fused glass techniques are generally used to create art glass, glass tiles, and jewellery, notably beads. Slumping techniques allow the creation of larger, functional pieces like dishes, bowls, plates, and ashtrays. Producing functional pieces generally requires 2 or more separate firings, one to fuse the glass and a second slump it to shape. Since the 1970s, more hobbyists have focused on using kiln-fused glass to make beads and components for jewellery. This has become especially popular since the introduction of glass manufactured for the specific purpose of fusing in a kiln.

It is set in Britain at a time shortly after the 1745 Jacobite rising and is concerned with a family of adventurers and escaped Jacobites. Plot summary To escape exposure as a former Jacobite, Robin and his sister Prudence have exchanged identities and assumed new names. The tall sister takes the name Peter while the slighter Robin is disguised as his younger sister, Kate. On their way to London, the pair encounter Gregory Markham eloping with a beautiful heiress named Letitia Grayson and rescue her. Shortly afterwards Sir Anthony, a friend of Letitia's father, arrives to discover that the elopement has already been frustrated and takes her home. \\"Peter\\" and \\"Kate\\" take refuge in London with Lady Lowestoft, a former admirer of their adventurous father, and quickly rise to social prominence. Peter/Prudence comes under the patronage of Sir Anthony in particular, but he is recognised by the vengeful Markham, who tries to have him beaten by Mohocks. Later Peter is provoked into challenging Markham’s friend Rensley to a duel. Hearing of this, Sir Anthony forestalls their fight by insulting Rensley in order to force him into an earlier duel and disables him. Startled by this intervention, Prudence/Peter begins to wonder if Sir Anthony suspects her masquerade. Meanwhile their father, whom they refer to as “The Old Gentleman”, has arrived in London claiming to be the younger brother and legal heir of the recently deceased Viscount Barham, much to the consternation of Rensley, who had long believed himself to be the heir and who had already installed himself as the new lord. Under the name of \\"Tremaine of Barham\\" the polished new claimant rapidly insinuates himself into high society. He does not acknowledge his children immediately, while they, long used to his delusions of grandeur and multiple identities, are sceptical of his claims. Prudence is invited to dine with Sir Anthony who, despite his air of sleepy detachment, has guessed that \\"Peter\\" is actually a woman and fallen in love with her. Prudence refuses his proposal, asking him to wait until her father's doubtful claim is proved, to which Sir Anthony agrees, although resolving to carry her off and marry her whatever the outcome. Having obtained a document that could get the Old Gentleman executed as a Jacobite himself, Markham attempts to blackmail him but is persuaded instead to exchange the incriminating letter for another that exposes Letitia's wealthy father as a traitor. Using this, Markham forces Letitia to run away with him again. To counter that, the Old Gentleman dispatches Robin/Kate, disguised as a highwayman, to kill Markham and steal back the exchanged document, thereby inspiring the romantic Letitia to fall in love with her unknown rescuer. When questioned by the authorities, Letitia gives a false description of the \\"highwayman\\" to protect her love. Unfortunately, she unwittingly describes \\"Peter Merriot\\" and Prudence is arrested. Once more she is rescued by the respectable Sir Anthony from the officers of the law and they gallop cross- country to the residence of Sir Anthony's sister. There \\"Peter\\" dons a gown and becomes the dazzling Miss Prudence Tremaine. Following \\"Peter's\\" disappearance, suspicion is cast over both the Merriots, and so \\"Kate\\" flees to France while Lady Lowestoft complains of the deception played upon her by her protégés. In the interval the Old Gentleman proves conclusively that he is indeed Tremaine of Barham and the former Kate returns from France, causing a sensation as Mr. Robin Tremaine, his handsome heir. Calling on Letitia's father, the future Viscount is readily accepted as a prospective son-in-law while Tremaine of Barham welcomes Sir Anthony as Prudence’s fiancé and a son- in-law after his own heart.

In ice hockey, the goaltender wears specialized goaltending equipment to protect himself from the impact of the puck and to assist himself in making saves. Most modern goaltending equipment is made from hydrophobic synthetic leather and nylon on the outside and dense closed-cell foams and plastics inside. In the past, pads were often made out of leather and stuffed with horse hair. Professional pads were stuffed with deer hair, which is hollow, giving more protection. The National Hockey League (NHL) specifies maximum dimensions of goaltending equipment to prevent goaltenders from having an unfair advantage. Many other professional and non-professional leagues adhere to equipment size regulations based on International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) rules. Blocker A blocker designed for roller hockey The blocker consists of a glove with a rectangular board attached to the backhand side. The board is usually curved up at one end, which is designed to help control the deflection of the puck and will create a tougher angle on a shot if a goaltender uses the shaft-down technique. The blocker is worn on the hand that holds the stick, so a right-handed goaltender wears the blocker on the right hand, and a left- handed goaltender wears it on the left hand. This is called a \\"full right goalie\\" as the goaltender wears the catch glove in the right hand. A blocker is sometimes called a waffle, and less commonly as a domino, in reference to older models, which were covered with real leather, but had holes cut in the leather to save weight, giving the blocker a waffle-like appearance. The placement of the palm on the back of the blocker varies though it has been traditionally placed in the middle. Newer models tend to place the palm further to the inside of the glove in order cover more of the net. Typically, the goaltender wears only one blocker. However, near the end of his career, retired goaltender Dan Blackburn played with two blockers after nerve damage rendered him incapable of closing his glove hand. Catcher The Catcher or glove is the glove worn on the free hand. It is similar to a baseball mitt, but has additional padding to protect the lower forearm, wrist, palm, fingers and thumb, and has a deeper pocket. The first goaltender trapper, worn by Reid Miller in 1948, who played for the Wadena Wolverines and the North Stars, was a baseball first baseman's mitt. Common variations among trappers include the pocket angle or \\"break\\": this refers to the angle at which the glove closes, usually measured from 60 - 90 degrees. Trappers tend to be one of the most cared-for pieces of equipment for the goaltender. In order to prevent what is called a \\"pancake pocket\\", goaltenders often deepen the pocket by strapping objects inside the glove when not in use. The trapper's fit is extremely important as well as the goaltender's sense of the pocket and angles of the trapper. As a result, transitioning to a new glove may be difficult because of the significant break-in time. The total circumference of a trapper is 45 inches, modified down from 48 inches. Chest and arm protector The chest and arm protector or arm and body pad is designed to protect the chest, shoulders, arms, and collarbone area from the impact of pucks and is worn under the hockey jersey. The chest and arm protector has continually become more protective in recent years. In the early days of goaltending, it was much smaller and less protective, consisting mostly of thick felt. In effect, these pads were little better than what baseball catchers wear today. With the advent of better materials such as high density plastics and foams, chest protectors can be made to protect the body from injury. However, even with modern chest protectors, goaltenders still receive bruises and other minor injuries from pucks that hit them in the torso. Jockstrap A goaltender jock with a cup pocket, which protects the pelvic area, is more protective than a common jockstrap with protective cup, though it generally uses the same internal plastic cup, or maybe a bit larger. The jock has padding over the internal plastic cup and additional padding from the top of the cup to the waist. Many modern jocks use two cups, one in front of the other, in order to provide more protection. Instead of a jock, female goaltenders wear a pelvic protector known as a jill. Leg pads Goalie Jacques Plante wearing goaltender equipment from the 1940s Goaltenders wear special leg pads to protect their legs and knees. Leg pads have evolved significantly over the years. The earliest leg pads were very similar to the cricket pads from which they were adopted. They were constructed of leather and stuffed with deer hair and sometimes Kapok, a material that was used in life preservers on ships. In the 1930s, leg pads became more specialized, becoming wider and thicker. In the 1940s, an extra roll of material, called a skip-over roll, was added to the outside edge of each pad face, extending from the lowest point of the pad covering the foot, called the boot break, to just below the knee rolls. In the 1950s, the skip-over roll was extended to the very top of the leg pad. In the 1980s, additional padding was added to protect the inside areas of the legs and knees. Toe foils, a plastic shield that was affixed to the bottom outside edge of the goaltender pad, began to be used but were later not allowed by equipment regulations. Leg pad design and construction remained static until the 1990s when synthetic leathers and high density foams began to be used in pad construction. Advantages of synthetic materials were lighter weight and less saturation from water, lower cost, a quick break-in period, and leg pads that could be manufactured in the colors of the goaltender's team. Some leg pad manufacturers replaced the leather toe strap with a toe bridge to affix the front of the leg pad to the front of the goalie skate. Starting around 2000, the \\"box\\" style leg pads became popular as goaltending playing technique evolved to a blocking style versus the reacting style of the past. In the \\"box\\" style pad, the edge between the pad face and the pad inside edge is square, keeping the pad face more perpendicular with the ice surface and maximizing the blocking area when the goaltender is in the \\"butterfly\\" position. Currently, ice hockey regulations require that leg pads be no wider than and can be no longer than . The NHL has also brought in rules stating that each goaltender will be measured for height, and then the height of allowable pads will be calculated in proportion to the height of the goaltender. Mask Martin Gerber, playing for the Ottawa Senators, wearing a modern goalie mask. The first modern goaltender mask was pioneered by professional goaltender Jacques Plante. Early masks were constructed from fiberglass and were molded to the shape of the wearer's face. These became less popular in the year 1969 in North America when a series of severe and career ending injuries struck down many NHL goaltenders using molded masks and prompted the Canadian Standards Association to outlaw molded masks in 1978. Assuredly, it was also Vladislav Tretiak's brilliant play during Canada-USSR 1972 Summit Series, that North American players first began to notice the superiority of the helmet/cage-type mask as opposed to the form-fitting fiberglass model, especially in terms of increased vision. Another significant advance in mask design came during the 1974-75 season, when goaltending great Tony Esposito, who had experienced puck and stick injuries to his eyes, fitted a steel cage over the eyeholes of his molded mask and crafted a fiberglass extension to protect the top of his head, thereby setting the groundwork for the next step in mask evolution, the modern goaltender mask, commonly referred to as the \\"hybrid\\" mask. Today, most goaltenders utilize hybrid masks made of fiberglass, kevlar, carbon fiber, and other composite materials. Modern masks have a large cutout in the eye and nose area covered by a steel or titanium cage. Many goaltenders are able to be identified by the custom artwork airbrushed on their masks. Some maintain the same theme throughout their career, changing the colors to match their team's colors. Examples include Curtis Joseph's Cujo, Ed Belfour's eagle, Félix Potvin's abstract cat design, Martin Brodeur's generic Devils mask, or Patrick Lalime's Marvin the Martian. Some goaltenders have more generic team-specific artwork, while others vary the artwork over the course of their careers. An alternative to the mask, is the earlier mentioned \\"bird-cage\\" helmet and cage combo, which consists of a wire facemask attached to a standard hockey helmet. This became popular during the 1970s since a cage provides better sightlines than a molded fiberglass mask. Its popularity peaked during the 1980s, yet started to decline during the 1990s, as hockey equipment manufacturers discontinued the production of helmets and cages favored by goaltenders. By the turn of the 21st century, only a few professional goalies still wore a helmet/cage combo. Included in this small group were Chris Osgood of the Detroit Red Wings and Rick DiPietro of the New York Islanders in the NHL, Martin Prusek of Dinamo Riga in the KHL, and Marco Bührer of SC Bern in the Swiss National League A. Dominik Hašek also wore the helmet/cage combo for the duration of his career. There were various helmet/cage combinations used by professionals. One was the Cooper SK600 helmet with the Cooper HM30 cage (worn by Ken Wregget and Billy Smith). Another was the Cooper SK2000 helmet with either the Cooper HM30 cage (previously used by Osgood and Dan Cloutier) or the Cooper HM50 cage (previously used by Hašek). Another one was the Jofa 280 Helmet with the 260.51 cage, which was last worn by Arturs Irbe. Don Beaupre wore a Cooper SK600 with a Jofa 260.51 cage. After Nike acquired Cooper and consolidated it as Nike Bauer, the SK2000 and HM50 were discontinued, while the HM30 was marketed as a field hockey mask (and subsequently discontinued in 2004). Jofa eventually phased out the 280 helmet and its respective cage, but now offer the RBK 3K helmet and 287 cage for the European market since consolidating with Reebok. There are currently two models of goaltender masks which are both available to the North American market and based on the helmet/cage combination. The first model is the Hasek Pro Style 357, manufactured by the Warwick Mask Company, which follows the traditional helmet/cage style of masks. Current users of these helmets include Prusek and Bührer, while Hašek used this model from the 2001-02 season up to his retirement. The second is the Mage, manufactured by Sportmask. The difference between the Mage and other helmet/cage combinations is that the Mage's cage attaches to a helmet with a back plate as opposed to a helmet that's enclosed. Mage users include Florida Panthers goaltender Tim Thomas and Genève-Servette HC goaltender Tobias Stephan.  Pants/Breezers  Goaltenders' pants are similar in appearance to the pants that forwards and defensemen wear. Goaltender pants are heavily padded all down the front and sides, with a tailbone protector incorporated into the rear of the pant. They also have protective foams on the inner thigh for increased protection from shots. They also have attachments for the options of suspenders.  Skates  Goal skates differ from regular hockey skates: the blade is longer, wider, and flatter to provide the goalie with more stability and to prevent the blade from bending when hit by shots. The blades are usually made from stainless steel, carbon steel, or titanium nitride. The blade holder, which is molded to the cowling or affixed directly to the boot, was historically shorter vertically so that the goaltender is lower to the ice. Modern goalie blades have become much taller to give goalies the ability to have a wide stance without losing their blade edge contact with the ice. The boot does not have a tendon guard, which is the piece of a regular hockey skate that extends up the back of the ankle to protect the Achilles' tendon. Finally, the boot used to be inside a rigid cowling to protect the foot from direct impact. The current trend is to remove the cowling. Cowlings made the skates wider, especially at the bottom of the boot. When the modern goaltender went into a deep \\"butterfly\\" position, to see between the players in front of him, the cowl would lift the blade off the ice. The new goaltender skate is made out of newer materials, allowing the boot itself to provide the needed protection. The cowlings are being phased out of professional play. Stick  The special hockey stick goaltenders use has a blade that is approximately wide. The lower of the shaft is widened to provide more blocking surface. This area is called the paddle. Although traditional goaltender sticks were usually made completely of wood, most modern sticks are reinforced with graphite and fiberglass and the paddle and blade are injected with foam to make them lighter. Recently, manufacturers have begun to produce sticks made completely from composite materials, which are lighter. However, it may be argued that composite sticks are less durable than their wooden counterparts. While these sticks are widely sold, most professional goaltenders have continued to use the foam core paddle-wood shaft type, even though it may be painted to look composite. The reason is both durability and the ability of the \\"old\\" style construction to absorb shock. Player sticks are made to transmit feeling (i.e. of the puck) to the player's hands when stickhandling. Goaltenders need the stick to absorb the shock of the puck impact when making a save.

Unlike Test cricket, the fielders are spread out to save runs in limited overs cricket. The powerplay rule (Restrictions on the placement of fielders), along with a number of other factors, has contributed to the big scores (300+) in modern One Day Internationals. Rules One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 differ in terms of the number of overs where mandatory powerplay rules apply. The rules below apply only when a match is uninterrupted. =ODI= * During the first 10 overs of an innings, a maximum of two fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle (27 metres). This is called the 1st powerplay. * Between overs 11 and 40, a maximum of four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. * In the final 10 overs (41–50), a maximum of five fielders will be allowed to field outside the 30-yard circle. =Twenty20= The first six overs of an innings will be a mandatory powerplay, with only two fielders allowed outside the 30-yard circle. Beginning with the seventh over, no more than five fielders will be allowed outside the 30-yard circle. History Fielding restrictions evolved through the 1970s, notably in World Series Cricket,Cricket's Turning Points: Fifteen-over field restrictions, ESPNcricinfo, 1 May 2011 and were first introduced in ODIs in 1980 in Australia. The most common rule was for only two fielders to be allowed outside the circle in the first fifteen overs, then five fielders allowed outside the circle for the remaining overs. The powerplay nomenclature was introduced by the International Cricket Council in 2005, when the fielding restrictions were split into 3 blocks: the mandatory ten overs at the start of the innings and two further five-over powerplays with the bowling team being able to choose the timing of both. In practice though, both were generally taken as soon as possible, effectively leading to a single block of 20 overs of fielding restrictions. To counter this, in 2008, the batting team was given discretion for the timing of one of the two powerplays. From 1 October 2011, the ICC brought additional changes to the bowling and batting powerplays. Under the new rules, in a 50-over match, neither powerplay may be taken before the start of the 16th over and both must be completed before the commencement of the 41st over, so overs 11 to 15 and 41 to 50 cannot be powerplay overs. Should either or both teams choose not to exercise their discretion, their powerplay overs will automatically commence at the latest available point in the innings (e.g. in a 50-over innings with one unclaimed powerplay, it will begin at the start of the 36th over). On 29 October 2012, the ICC made further amendments on powerplays, reducing the number of blocks of powerplays from three to two. From 1992 to 2012, during non-powerplay overs a total of five fielders were allowed outside the circle. This was changed to four in October 2012. Moreover, from 1992 to 2005, two fielders were required in catching positions in the first fifteen overs. This was reduced to the first ten overs in July 2005.Three powerplays explained From 5 July 2015, the ICC further amended the rules, making the whole innings as a composition of 3 powerplays, thus removing the batting powerplay previously introduced. Furthermore, the restriction of two catching fielders on the first powerplay was relaxed.

Vang was born on a CIA military base, Long Cheng, Laos, at the end of the Vietnam War, and immigrated to America in 1980. A fiction writer, poet, playwright, and former journalist, Vang has devoted much of her professional life to capturing Hmong folktales on paper. She is a recipient of the Archibald Bush Artist Fellowship and several other artistic and leadership awards. She is the author of the children's book, Shoua and the Northern Lights Dragon, a finalist for the 23rd Annual Midwest Book Awards in 2012. Early life The daughter of a major in the Royal Lao Army and a shaman, Vang grew up in her early years in Thai refugee camps before resettling in the United States Midwest, with the majority of her formative years spent in the Twin Cities and the Frogtown quarter of St. Paul, Minnesota. Writing Bi-culturalism was a significant issue in Vang's experience as she sought ways to succeed in both Hmong and American society, and this experience is frequently reflected in her later writing. While issues of bi-culturalism are a part of the experiences of many Hmong refugees, Vang's approach is noteworthy for her consistent efforts to cultivate a more informed, global perspective of those issues, particularly through international travel. She has traveled to over 40 different countries for research and leisure. She is particularly interested in the stories of Asian/Hmong women, whose perspective she feels is frequently underrepresented in community discussions and literature. =Books= Shoua and the Northern Lights Dragon was jointly published by the Minnesota Humanities Center and the Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans to address the lack of children's books that speak to the experience of being an Asian Pacific Islander child or youth in the United States. The book supports the development of English literacy skills while recognizing cultural heritage and creating opportunities for children and families to learn about Asian Pacific Islander cultural heritage. Her short stories and essays have been featured in six anthologies including, “Riding Shotgun: Women Write about their Mothers,” published by Borealis Books, and “Haunted Hearths and Sapphic Shades: Lesbian Ghost Stories” published by Lethe Press, which was a national best-seller in the United Kingdom, and the ground-breaking Asian American anthology, “Charlie Chan Is Dead 2: At Home In The World,” published by Penguin Books. In 2009, Ka Vang was featured in the book, “Hmong History Makers,” published by Holt DcDougal for her work collecting and preserving Hmong folklore from the Hmong people across the globe from Australia to Germany. Her work is taught in classrooms and has appeared nationally in magazines and newspapers. Vang was one of the first Hmong-American news journalist in the world working for the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Chicago Tribune, and for 10 years was a regular columnist for the Minnesota Women's Press. She lives in the Twin Cities, Minnesota, with her husband and children. She is also featured the anthology, Charlie Chan is Dead 2:At Home In The World, the first Hmong writer to be featured in the series. Among her most well-known stories is \\"How Ms. Pac-Man Ruined My Gang Life.\\" Vang's work frequently incorporate elements of Magic Realism from a Southeast Asian American perspective. In 2008, Vang's writings were published in two bestselling anthologies. The essay titled, Butterfly Cycles, was published in \\"Riding Shotgun:Women Write about their Mothers,\\" by Borealis Press in April and the short story, Meet Mr. Krenshaw, was published in \\"Haunted Hearths and Sapphic Shades: Lesbian Ghost Stories\\" with Lethe Press in May. \\"Riding Shotgun,\\" was the bestselling local nonfiction book in Minnesota while \\"Haunted Hearths,\\" was a bestseller in the United Kingdom. Vang's poetry has a distinctive style compared to other Hmong writers for its strong imagery and use of metaphor, typically fused with contemporary social concerns as well as pop culture and literary references from both Western and Hmong traditions. Her poems are written with a strong sense of the oral tradition of poetry, and contemporary influences of spoken word and performance poetry. Well-known examples of her poetry include the poem 'Extraordinary Hmong,' originally written in response to African American poet Maya Angelou's 'Phenomenal Woman' and Vang's poem 'Undiscovered Country' that includes references to Star Trek, Shakespeare's Hamlet and John Cougar Mellencamp. Vang's work is known for its frank confrontation of sex and sexuality, race, culture and racism, but also for its surprising subtlety and elaborate, yet accessible constructions and dark humor. =Plays= Vang began experimenting with playwriting in the 2000s, starting as a 2001 and 2002 Many Voices Fellow at the Playwrights' Center in Minneapolis. Her one-act play, DISCONNECT, was performed at the Playwrights' Center and later by Theater Mu during the 2001 New Eyes Festival. DISCONNECT has continued to be performed across the country including New York City, particularly since its appearance in the Hmong American literary anthology, Bamboo Among The Oaks in 2002. Another play, Dead Calling, was performed at Intermedia Arts in Minneapolis in 2001. Dead Calling was one of the first Hmong mystery plays. The play was set in St. Paul and was noted by audiences for its frank depiction of interracial marriage in the Hmong community. Her play, From Shadows to Light was performed by Theater Mu in the fall of 2004 at the Mixed Blood Theater in Minneapolis. From Shadows to Light integrated contemporary international women's issues with traditional art forms from Asia, such as Indonesian shadow puppetry. Hmong Oral History Research Vang frequently travels abroad to collect folklore and contemporary life stories from Hmong expatriate communities around the world including France, Germany and Australia. She is credited with keeping the Hmong art form of oral storytelling alive by her performances and folklore collection. She was recognized in the book, “Hmong History Makers,” published by Holt DcDougal for her work collecting and preserving Hmong folklore from the Hmong people across the globe from Australia to Germany.

He was a chief adviser to Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder and first emperor of the Jin dynasty. Described by modern writers as the \\"Chief Shaman\\" of the pre-Jin Jurchen state,Tao (1976), Page 95. he became deeply interested in Han Chinese culture, and is particularly known as the creator of the first writing system for the Jurchen language. Life Wanyan Xiyin's original Jurchen name is transcribed in Chinese sources as \\"Gushen\\", \\"Wushi\\" or \\"Hushe\\". He was from the Wanyan tribe, the ruling clan of the Jin dynasty, but was not in the direct imperial family line.Franke 1997(I), pp. 150-151. His father was Huandu (歡都), a cousin of Aguda (Emperor Taizu), the founder of the Jin dynasty. Along with Nianhan (Wanyan Zonghan), Wanyan Xiyin was one of the chief advisers to Aguda. He helped Aguda in unifying the various Jurchen tribes under the Wanyan tribe's leadership, and overthrowing the Khitan-led Liao dynasty.Franke 1997(I), p. 154 After Aguda's death, Wanyan Xiyin continued to serve as a civil minister in the imperial court of Wuqimai (Emperor Taizong), Aguda's younger brother and successor. However, he fell into disgrace during the reign of Emperor Xizong, Emperor Taizong's successor, and was eventually forced to commit suicide in 1140. According to contemporary Chinese sources, Wanyan Xiyin \\"was crafted and talented. It was he who personally devised laws and the script for the Jurchen, and thus shaped them into one state (guo; 國). The people of the state called him shan-man (珊蠻); shan-man in Jurchen refers to a shaman. This is because he understood changing conditions like a good. From Nianhan down, nobody was able to be his equal.\\"Franke 1997(I), pp. 155-156. As the translator of this text, Herbert Franke, notes, this may be the earliest known Chinese document in which the term shaman (珊蠻) is attested; it corresponds to the Manchu saman (\\"shaman, sorcerer\\"). Wanyan Xiyin was fascinated by Chinese classics, and collected a large library when Jurchens seized and looted the capital of the Northern Song dynasty, Bianjing (present- day Kaifeng), in the Jin–Song Wars. He invited several Han Chinese scholars, led by Yuwen Xuzhong (宇文虛中; a Song envoy detained by the Jurchens), to advise him and to teach his sons and grandsons. Hong Hao (洪皓) – another Song envoy similarly detained by the Jurchens – though that it was under Yuwen Xuzhong's influence that a variety of Han Chinese cultural practices entered the Jin dynasty, such as the forms of government organisations, the scale of official ranks, salaries, and hereditary privileges, as well as the rules for assigning posthumous names to emperors and the taboo against using characters that appear in emperors' names.Tao (1976), pages 31, 40. The instruction offered by Yuwen Xuzhong and other Han Chinese scholars must have been successful, as Wanyan Xiyin's sons were able to write Chinese poems for Hong Hao. The degree of their sinicisation was high enough for one of them to become one of the first Jurchens to have a Han Chinese wife. The tombs of Wanyan Xiyin and his family members are said to be located near present-day Shulan, Jilin Province. Since 1961, they have been listed on the provincial register of the protected historical sites.完颜希尹家族墓地 (Wanyan Xiyin Family Tombs Site) Jurchen script On Aguda's orders, in 1119 or 1120, Wanyan Xiyin created the Jurchen script, known as the \\"large-character script\\", for use in the administration of the new Jurchen (Jin) Empire. He based it on Chinese characters and the Khitan script.

Found by his chambermaid near a white flag atop a short wooden staff, Healey had been hit in the head and then left in his garden to be eaten alive by strategically placed maggots and stung by hornets. Then Reverend Talbot, who was paid by the Harvard Corporation to write against Dante, was found dead in an underground cemetery, buried up to his waist upside down, his feet burnt and buried over money that he had accepted as a bribe. Members of the Dante Club, a group of poets translating the Divine Comedy from Italian into English, notice the parallels between the murders and the punishments detailed in Dante's Inferno. The club, including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., and James Russell Lowell, sets out to solve the murders, fearing that the truth will ruin Dante's burgeoning reputation in America, thus making their translation a failure, as well as the obvious problem that they would be virtually the only suspects if they reported this information to the police. Then, Phineas Jennison, both a wealthy contributor to the Harvard Corporation and friend to the translators (a \\"schismatic\\"), is sliced open exactly down the middle--all killed in extreme fashion and undeniable resemblance to the punishments of people in Dante's Inferno. Eventually, the murderer is discovered to be a former Civil War Soldier Dan Teal, a man who worked at Ticknor and Fields and at the Harvard Corporation. Driven partly mad by the trauma of his war experiences, Teal hears Dante Club member George Washington Greene giving sermons on Dante to other soldiers, and becomes convinced that Dante alone understood the need for perfect justice in the world. Adopting a new name and identity (intending to become one with the poet, but being unable to spell \\"Alighieri\\"), he takes it upon himself to protect Dante and release Hell's punishments as indicated in the Inferno, in order to purify the city. Teal finds each of his victims when learning of their involvement in the stopping of the translations, which become their respective sins. The club eventually tries to capture him, with the aid of Boston's first African- American policeman Nicholas Rey, the only other person who saw the connection, while he is attempting to punish Harvard Treasurer Dr. Manning and Pliny Mead (\\"the traitors\\"). Mead was a student of the Dante course who helped betray his teacher by cooperating with Manning. Teal flees, then tries to round up the translators, to punish them for not embracing his \\"work.\\" Dr. Manning--saved by Longfellow, Holmes, Rey, Lowell, and Fields--realizes the situation as he recovered from his attempted punishment of being buried naked in ice. He sees Teal with a gun to Longfellow, and Manning ends the murderer's life, thus returning the city to normal.

Activated on 1 June 1948, MATS was a consolidation of the United States Navy's Naval Air Transport Service (NATS) and the United States Air Force's Air Transport Command (ATC) into a single joint command. It was inactivated and discontinued on 8 January 1966 when the Air Force and Military Airlift Command (MAC) as a separate strategic airlift command and returned shore-based Navy cargo aircraft to Navy control as operational support airlift (OSA) aircraft. In 1966, the World War II Air Transport Command (ATC) (1942–1948) and the Military Air Transport Service were consolidated with Military Airlift Command (MAC) (1966–1992). Overview The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) was activated under United States Air Force Major General Laurence S. Kuter, in order to harness interservice efforts more efficiently. It was an amalgamation of Navy and Army air transport commands, jointly placed by the Department of Defense under the control of the newly created United States Air Force (USAF) as a unified command. During World War II, the Army Air Force's aerial transportation requirements were performed by the Air Transport Command which had a dual function of ferrying new aircraft from factories to combat theaters and transportation of troops and supplies, also organized by Tunner. The Naval Air Transport Service focused on supporting deployed Naval and Marine personnel transporting vital cargo, specialist personnel and mail to the Fleet and ground forces, especially in advanced areas of operation. MATS was the first Joint-Service command and Naval aircrews participated in every major MATS airlift operation. MATS would organizationally be under the Department of the Air Force, as the vast majority of its equipment and personnel of ATC had been inherited by the Air Force with the inactivation of the USAAF. During the Berlin Airlift, Naval aviators flew transport aircraft from the United States to European supply depots; in the Korean War, MATS Navy Squadrons airlifted some 17,000 battle casualties. In its original organization, a Rear Admiral commanded the MATS Pacific Division and another rear admiral served as MATS vice-commander. During the 1958 reorganization, senior Naval officers were on the staffs of the commanders of both EASTAF and WESTAF, and at MATS Headquarters. In 1965 conflicting views of the Air Force and Navy triggered by the demands of the Vietnam War led to the services returning to separate airlift commands. In turn, MATS was disbanded and superseded in the Air Force by the Military Airlift Command, during a 1966 restructuring. History =Origins= With the end of World War II, the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command found itself in limbo. Senior USAAF authorities considered ATC to be a wartime necessity that was no longer needed, and expected its civilian personnel, including former airline pilots, to return to their peacetime occupations. Senior ATC officers, on the other hand, thought that ATC should be developed into a national government operated airline, an idea that was soundly opposed by the airline industry. While the war had firmly established the necessity of a troop carrier mission, most military officers believed the role performed by ATC should be provided by contract carriers. When the United States Air Force was established as a separate service in 1947, the Air Transport Command was not established as one of its major commands. The ATC commander and his staff took it upon themselves to convince the new civilian leadership of the newly created Department of Defense (DOD) (and Secretaries of the Army and Air Force) that ATC had a mission. They seized upon testimony by former I Troop Carrier Command commander Major General Paul L. Williams that the Air Force should have a long-range troop deployment capability, and began advocating that ATC transports could be used to deploy troops. Williams had been pressing for the development of a long-range troop carrier airplane when he made his statement. A U.S. Navy Douglas R6D-1 Liftmaster, BuNo 128425, operating for the Military Air Transport Service in the 1950s.The DOD believed it should have its own air transport service and decided that ATC should become the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), supported by the Air Force, even though not listed as a formal military mission. Also, as a cost-saving measure, MATS would combine the resources of Air Transport Command with those of the Naval Air Transport Service. This way the command would be sanctioned by the Department of Defense, and not by either the Air Force or the Navy. Although MATS was under the operational control of the United States Air Force, the United States Navy was a full partner in the command and operational components of the organization. Major naval components of MATS were naval air transport (VR) squadrons. VR-3 and VR-6 were assigned to McGuire AFB and VR-22 was assigned to the Naval Air Transport Station at Naval Station Norfolk/Chambers Field, Virginia. Together they constituted MATS EASTAF's Naval Air Transport Wing, Atlantic. On the Pacific Coast, Naval Air Transport Wing, Pacific, consisted of Air Transport Squadron VR-7 and Maintenance Squadron VR-8, both at Naval Air Station Moffett Field, California. A detachment of VR-7 was also stationed at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. Naval aviators flew scheduled MATS routes to Newfoundland, Iceland, Scotland, West Germany, Italy, Puerto Rico and Africa. In the Pacific, MATS naval aviators flew to all MATS stations from Hawaii to Japan to South Vietnam, Bangkok, India and to Saudi Arabia. Air Force pilots flew Navy MATS planes, just as naval aviators could be found piloting Air Force MATS transport aircraft. =Organization= Routes of the Eastern Transport Air Force, 1964 Route map of the Western Transport Air Force, 1964 MATS Lockheed C-141A-10-LM Starlifter, AF Ser.

Inheriting that legacy, MATS continued that service and organized it into three major transport divisions; * Atlantic Division (after 1 July 1958: EASTAF) - From McGuire AFB, New Jersey, provided service across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe; to the Caribbean and South America; to North Africa and the Middle East to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia * Pacific Division (after 1 July 1958: WESTAF) - From Travis AFB, California, provided service to Hawaii and on to locations in the Pacific, including Japan and the Philippines; across Southeast Asia; India; Pakistan and on to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. * Continental Division - From McGuire to points in Northern Canada; along the North Atlantic coast north to Thule AB, Greenland. From Travis north to McChord AFB, Washington, then north to Alaska and Aleutian Islands, then a connection into Tachikawa AB, Japan from Shemya AFS. Also provided coast to coast aeromedical evacuation flights within the United States and cargo service between major Air Force Air Materiel Command depots. The division was disbanded on 1 July 1958, with mission divided between Eastern Transport Air Force (EASTAF) and Western Transport Air Force (WESTAF). When MATS was established, it also took responsibility for several other missions: * Special Air Mission (SAM) The Special Air Mission was the transport of the President of the United States; Vice-President; Cabinet Members; Member of Congress; Senators, and designated other individuals, such as Foreign Heads of State. * Air Rescue Service (ARS) Provided rescue of downed military service members in enemy occupied areas; humanitarian relief to civilians in emergency conditions (floods, hurricanes, earthquakes) * Air Weather Service (ARS) Weather forecasting for military airfields; hurricane hunters. * Air Photographic and Charting Service (APCS) Mapping the world providing accurate aerial charts to military aviators wherever they need to be. Also producing all Air Force training films; public relations films; monthly newsreels, and coordinating with private filmmakers with regards to use of Air Force equipment and facilities. * Aeromedical Transport Wing (AMTW) Evacuation of wounded military personnel from combat zones; transport of critically ill military personnel (and dependents) to military medical facilities for treatment. * Air Resupply And Communications Service (ARCS) Performed unconventional warfare missions during the Korean War and early years of the Cold War (1950–1956). =Major operations= Berlin Airlift (1948–1949) MATS was established on 1 June 1948, less than a month before the commencement of the Berlin Airlift -- \\"OPERATION VITTLES\\" where at peak operations, planes were landing and departing every ninety seconds or so shuttling in thousands of tons of supplies, food, and fuel each day - but they were not MATS airplanes. The Soviet Union had blocked all surface transportation in the western part of Berlin. Railroads tracks were destroyed, barges were stopped on the rivers, and highways and roads blocked. The only avenue left was through the air. On 26 June 1948, the airlift began. Troop carrier transports from around the globe began making their way to Germany, where they were assigned to United States Air Forces, Europe. Squadrons transferred from as far away as Hawaii and Japan, and included two of the U.S. Navy's air transport squadrons assigned to MATS. MATS itself was not \\"in charge\\" of the airlift, although several MATS staff officers were sent to Germany to serve in the Airlift Task Force in an administrative role. Lt. General William H. Tunner was placed in overall command of airlift operations, reporting to the commander of United States Air Forces, Europe. The airlift itself was a USAFE operation and all airplanes assigned to it were assigned to one of five troop carrier groups that were sent to Europe to operate the airlift. MATS played a supporting role, including ferrying C-54s to and from the airlift bases and maintenance depots in the United States and the MATS C-54 training school trained pilots for temporary duty in the airlift. MATS transports delivered crucial aircraft parts to the airlift bases in Europe. This operation would continue for some 15 months until the Soviets lifted the blockade. MATS would provide numerous humanitarian airlifts of global proportions. The U.S. Navy was an integral part of MATS, providing five transport squadrons to the joint service effort, but they operated under USAFE while they were part of the airlift. Korean War (1950–1953) The organization's next major test was the bootstrap supply operations supporting the United Nations troops under General Douglas MacArthur in the country of South Korea which was nearly overrun by the time UN forces were mobilized. The MATS role was purely logistical, and operated from the United States to Japan. Theater transport forces assigned to the Far East Air Forces Combat Cargo Command, which became the 315th Air Division, operated supply routes into Japan and provided troop carrier services for UN forces. Suez, Lebanon and Taiwan Straits Crisis (1956–1958) During the 1956 Suez Crisis, MATS MATS airlifted 1,300 Colombian and Indian troops from Bogotá and Agra to the United Nations staging area in Naples, Italy, to supplement the UN police force in the Suez area. In 1958, MATS airlifted 5,500 tons of cargo and 5,400 troops to the Middle East in support of the Lebanese government, also supporting the move of a TAC Composite Air Strike Force to the area. Also in 1958, MATS flew 144 airlift trips to the Far East when the crisis arose in the Formosa Straits, supporting the move of a Composite Air Strike Force, and airlifting a squadron of F-104 Starfighters to Taiwan. Operation Deep Freeze (1957–1963) In December 1962, MATS Douglas C-124 Globemasters ended six years of seasonal flying as members of the Air Force- Navy team resupplying scientific stations in the Antarctic. During that time the aircraft, operated by the 63d Troop Carrier Wing stationed at Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, air-dropped about 4,000 tons of supplies from the main Antarctic base at McMurdo Sound to remote stations near and at the South Pole. Beginning in 1963, Lockheed C-130E Hercules, newer, faster, and longer range, picked up the MATS portion of the mission. The performance of the C-124s in the Antarctic cold strengthened the concept of airlift flexibility by doing in a few weeks (each year) a job that would have taken surface transportation several months. During Deep Freeze III, a C-124 air- dropped a seven-ton tractor to an isolated site, and during Deep Freeze 62 (October–December 1961), three C-124's made the longest flight in Antarctic history, a 3,100-mile round trip to airdrop supplies. Also during Deep Freeze 62, Lt. Gen. Joe W. Kelly became the first MATS commander to visit the operation. MATS vice commander, Maj. Gen. Raymond J. Reeves, visited Deep Freeze 63. Congo Airlift (1960–1963) MATS C-124 Globemasters and C-118 Liftmasters (and in November 1962, pure-jet C-135 Stratolifters) by the end of November had chalked up more than 2,000 missions in history's longest airlift reaching 5,000 miles from Europe around Africa's West Coast to Leopoldville in the Congo. MATS entered the United Nations airlift under direction of the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) 322d Air Division, 16 July 1960, and at the peak had 60 aircraft committed. By the end of 1962, about 49,000 troops and 11,000 tons of cargo had been airlifted to and from points as far away as New Delhi, India. Berlin Crisis (1961) As a result of the construction of the Berlin Wall and the ending of free crossing to and from their occupation zone of Berlin, more than 100 MATS =aircraft from EASTAF and WESTAF participated in deployments of American forces from the United States to West Germany and France. When the Reserve Forces were called to active duty in October 1961, MATS airlift force and technical units provided support for their movement to Europe. Operation Stair Step was the name given to the deployment of Air National Guard fighter units overseas to NATO bases in France, and Operation High Top was the redeployment, June–August 1962. In High Top, for example, more than 260 missions were flown by MATS aircraft of all types, including the C-97's which themselves had been called to active duty. These aircraft returned more than 9,600 ANG personnel and 1,400 tons of equipment. On addition, the 101st Airborne Division was airlifted from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to locations in Turkey. Approximately 2,000 personnel and 900 tons of equipment were airlifted (Exercise Checkmate II). During the exercise, about 300 MATS airmen and officers lived in tents for about three weeks handling maintenance and communications. Lt. Gen. Joe W. Kelly, MATS commander, was on hand to greet the first arriving aircraft, Despite \\"miserable\\" weather, no accidents or incidents occurred. Throughout 1962, tensions were high in Europe and in January, Exercise Long Thrust II was commenced in which MATS new four-engined jets, the Boeing C-135 Stratolifter, made their first appearance in a major airlift when 12 of them airlifted nearly 500 Army troops over the north polar route from Fort Lewis, Washington, to central West Germany. They made the nonstop trip in little more than 10 hours compared to the piston-engined aircraft which averaged between 30 and 35 hours along normal routes. Altogether, more than 200 MATS aircraft moved 5,300 troops of three battle groups of the Army's 4th Infantry Division in the deployment phase. The jets brought one battle group back. In West Germany, the troops participated in ground maneuvers with NATO forces. Cuban Missile Crisis (1962) In the midst of one of the heaviest airlift schedules it has ever had (more than 17 airlifts under way or developing during October and November), MATS was called on to support the buildup of forces in the southeastern part of the United States. On 16 October, MATS began working at its wartime activity rate. Between 16 October and the end of the month, MATS airlifted thousands of troops and thousands of tons in hundreds of sorties from bases throughout the country into Florida and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Included in this was the first major airlift of United States Marines and their combat gear by MATS. Also, during this buildup, MATS lost its first C-135 Stratolifter jet while it was engaged in an ammunition airlift to Guantanamo Bay. All three of the technical services stepped up activities to provide close weather, rescue, and documentation support to the buildup. During the airlift operation, MATS was called on to react to a call for arms to India in early November to stem the Communist Chinese invasion. The airlift required the movement of 980 tons of small arms more than 6,000 miles from Rhein-Main AB, West Germany, to Dum-Dum Airport, Calcutta. This \\"no notice\\" airlift was accomplished in eight days by MATS C-135 Stratolifter jets. Operation \\"Big Lift\\" (1963) In the first time that a full United States Army division and elements of a Tactical Air Command Strike Force were ferried across the ocean in one big airlift, 15,358 officers and men of the 2nd Armored Division, their support troops, and 504 tons of battle equipment were airlifted by 204 MATS aircraft from eight bases in the South and southwestern United States to France and Germany. They were accompanied by 116 tactical fighters and reconnaissance aircraft of the Composite Air Strike Force (CASF) who flew across the Atlantic. The entire operation was accomplished in 2½ days, employing 234 missions. The C-135 Stratolifter jets made the 5,600-mile trip in 10½ hours nonstop, carrying 75 troops each. It took the C-124 Globemasters three times as long, with refueling stops in Bermuda and the Azores to carry 80 troops and cargo. Following the NATO ground manoeuvers in Europe, the troops were lifted back to the United States on 21 November 1963 Vietnam War Beginning in 1948, MATS flew airlift missions into French Indochina, providing airlifts of military equipment and supplies to the French government and colonial Vietnamese forces fighting the Viet Minh. In 1954, at the request of the French, wounded Legionnaires from Dien Bien Phu were transported from Tan Son Nhut Airport to either Algeria or France. Initially flown from Saigon to Tachikawa AB near Tokyo on C-124s, over 14,000 wounded soldiers received stabilization medical care. From Japan, the wounded were airlifted across the Pacific Ocean to the Western United States on MATS C-97s. At each of the subsequent stops at Hickam AFB, Hawaii; Travis AFB, California, and Westover AFB, Massachusetts, there were layovers of about a day. This portion of the journey was carried out by MATS' Pacific Division. From Westover, the Atlantic Division took charge and airlifted the wounded to Orly Air Base in France and Oran Airport in Algeria. From start to finish, the mission took about a month to complete. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s military aid was shipped to the South Vietnamese government by MATS airlift flights into Tan Son Nhut. In addition, military flights were made to Don Muang Airport in Bangkok which were designated for the Thai Militarily to protect their border along the Mekong River, or clandestinely to the Laotian Government, who were fighting communist rebels in Laos. As the United States built up its forces in Southeast Asia in the early 1960s, the number of MATS flights to the area increased. MATS C-124s and C-133 Cargomasters were common sights. After the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Incident, and the decision being made to escalate United States involvement in the Vietnam War, MATS performed a critical role in the air transport of personnel and equipment to the war zone. Throughout 1964 and 1965 MATS flew large numbers of United States Army and United States Marines to South Vietnam. Large MATS aerial ports were established at Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay and Tan Son Nhut in South Vietnam, as well as at Don Muang Airport in Thailand to support the United States forces there. The first large-scale MATS jet transport flights of C-141A Starlifters were to Tan Son Nhut Air Base in 1965. During Vietnam, MATS was jokingly said to be an acronym for \\"Maybe Again, Tomorrow, Sometime.\\"Broughton, Jack, Thud Ridge. New York: Bantam Books, 1969. Military Airlift Command On 1 January 1966, as a result of the Navy announcing the withdrawal of its components, MATS was redesignated Military Airlift Command. The R5D Skymasters of Naval Transport Squadron Seven Alpha (VR-7A) were retired in July 1966 and the unit inactivated. VR-7, flying C-121/RV-7 Super Constellations remained attached to MAC until 31 January 1967, and the Naval Air Transport Wing (Pacific) was inactivated on 23 March 1967. VR-8 and VR-22 at NAS Moffett Field withdrew its C-130s from MAC on 20 April. The last naval squadron, VR-3, flying C-130s from McGuire AFB, was inactivated on 30 June and the formal DOD program action directive relieving the Navy from MAC responsibilities became effective 1 July 1967. Most passenger transport missions except the Special Air Mission were contracted out by MAC to commercial airlines such as Pan American, TWA, United, Continental, Northwest and charter companies such as Flying Tiger, using the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). This provided commercial airline pilots and aircrews valuable training, and during the years of the Vietnam War, seeing Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 commercial airliners at MAC aerial ports in Southeast Asia was a common sight. On 1 December 1974, MAC expanded its mission by acquiring the theater troop carrying and tactical airlift mission (i.e., C-130 Hercules, C-123 Provider, C-7 Caribou) previously performed by the combat commands (TAC, PACAF, USAFE). In 1987, MAC was designated as the Air Force component of the United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), a unified joint-service command. In June 1992, MAC was reorganized and redesignated as the Air Mobility Command (AMC) with a broadened mission of aerial refueling (i.e., KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender), acquired from the inactivating Strategic Air Command. AMC then succeeded MAC as the USAF component of USTRANSCOM. =Lineage= * Established and activated as Military Air Transport Service on 1 June 1948 : Mission and operational control of Air Transport

Under the USAF lineage system they did not a permanent lineage or history and were discontinued upon inactivation. Troop Carrier Units On 1 July 1957 a reorganization of USAF troop carrier forces included the transfer of Tactical Air Command Eighteenth Air Force heavy-lift C-124 Globemaster II units to MATS. However, the units retained their troop carrier designation and remained dedicated to support TAC on worldwide troop deployments. * 62d Troop Carrier Group, Larson AFB, Washington, 1 July 1957 – 18 June 1960 * 62d Troop Carrier Wing, McChord AFB, Washington, 18 June 1960 : Redesignated: 62d Air Transport Wing, Heavy, on 1 January 1965 : Redesignated: 62d Military Airlift Wing, Military Airlift Command, 8 January 1966 * 61st Troop Carrier Group, Donaldson AFB, South Carolina, 1 July 1957 – 8 October 1959 * 63d Troop Carrier Group, Donaldson AFB, South Carolina, 1 July 1957 – 18 January 1963 * 63d Troop Carrier Wing, Hunter AFB, Georgia, 18 January 1963 – 8 January 1966 : Redesignated: 63d Military Airlift Wing, Military Airlift Command, 8 January 1966 =Station facilities= Upon its establishment, Military Air Transport Service inherited much of Air Transport Command's worldwide network of stations and transport routes.

The scientific assumption today is that the smoke came from a peat fire. The first accounts of the smoke come from Seminoles living nearby, and by the 1830s, white settlers attributed the sight to campfires from white or Indian settlements, pirates, renegades, or a volcano. Over the years a number of folkloric explanations were given, along with plausibly naturalistic ones such as deep-burning peat fires. Several teams of investigators set out to solve the mystery during the late 19th century; the Smithsonian Institution holds correspondence from A. W. Barber between 1890–1894 concerning his experience there. Sightings occurred as far away as 20 miles, and were reported throughout much of the 19th century, but the phenomenon may have been visible much earlier; it has even been suggested that Wakulla, which may mean \\"mist\\" or \\"misting\\", received its name from the strange smoke. A number of explanations have been given, most famously that an active volcano stood out in the swamplands, but no one was able to locate the smoke's source before it disappeared forever on August 31, 1886, the day of the Charleston earthquake. Although a number of people have claimed to have found the crater of origin, modern geologists are quite certain no volcano could exist in Florida.

The First Battle of Saltville took place near the hospital. Establishment of the hospital The Confederate command selected the hills of southwest Virginia for a hospital as they determined it was an unlikely location to see combat. The command chose the Emory & Henry College for their hospital. This campus was located in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, and was adjacent to a railroad. Thus, the General Hospital at Emory and Henry College was born in May 1862. The medical corps of Virginia agreed to pay the college $2,500 in Confederate dollars for the first year of use. One year later the Secretary of War agreed to increase the amount paid to $4,000 at the request of the trustees. Stevenson writes, \\"The rent received was invested in Confederate and Virginia bonds to serve as an endowment for the future.\\" The rental of the farm, located adjacent to the campus, was a further source of income. The board of Trustees voted in 1861 to allow Professors Wiley, Davis, Buchanan, and Longley to have equal shares of the farmland for $500 a year. These revenue sources allowed the college to maintain its grounds and survive the war years. Battle of Saltville However, the war did come to Emory, Virginia. In October 1864, a major force of over 10,000 troops clashed at the salt works at Saltville, Virginia. Following the battle, Federal black soldiers of the 5th United States Colored Cavalry Regiment, and white soldiers of the 11th Missouri Cavalry, 13th Kentucky Cavalry, and the 12th Ohio Cavalry were treated for their wounds at local field hospitals and at the Emory & Henry College Hospital. The number of actual federal patients, following the battle, varies from 100 to 200. However, most records indicate that between 150 and 200 were Federal prisoners. The hospital housed 350 beds, and was under the care of Dr. J. B. Murfree. The Federal wounded were placed on the third and fourth floors of the main building. These floors were only accessible by two staircases at either end of the building, where guards were placed to prevent Federal troops from escaping. The prisoners who were housed at Wiley Hall, and testified at the trial of Champ Ferguson, included: Wm. H. Gardner, the Surgeon for the 13th Kentucky Cavalry; George W. Cutler, a second lieutenant in the 11th Michigan Cavalry; Lieutenant Smith of the 13th Kentucky Cavalry; Orange Sells of the 12th Ohio Cavalry; Captain Dagenfeld of the 12th Ohio Cavalry; Harry Shocker of the 12th Ohio Cavalry. William H. Gardner was a Federal surgeon who had been captured at Saltville. After being paroled by Major General Breckinridge, he stayed behind at Emory and Henry College Hospital to treat the massive casualties. On October 26, 1864, Gardner noted: \\"On Friday, October 7, several armed men entered the hospital around 10 p.m. and went up into the rooms occupied by the Federal wounded prisoners, and shot 2 of them (Negroes) dead in their beds.\\" The murders Orange Sells testified at the trial of Champ Ferguson after the war that, \\"The night before the killing, we heard a rustling on the stairway and immediately three men came into the room. One had a lighted candle and the other two had revolvers. They looked into each of our faces and after they got around, one of them remarked, ‘There are none of them here,’ and went out. They had hardly got out—had not been gone more than half a minute—until we heard firing in the next room to us. Some six shots were fired, and immediately afterward a Negro soldier was carried, dead, out of that room. Another Negro soldier ran into our room wrapped in a sheet.\\" Two different sources sited the death of at least two Negroes at the hospital, but neither listed their names. On October 8, 1864, Champ Ferguson entered the Emory and Henry College General Hospital with twelve to fifteen men almost unnoticed. Ferguson and another man then entered the room of Harry Shocker. Upon entering, a man with Champ recognized Shocker from the previous battle and said, \\"There was a wounded boy out of the 11th Michigan Cavalry lying in a bunk nearby. There is that boy now. I saved his life. He was lying among negroes at the time.\\" Champ then said, \\"If I’d seen you lying among the Negroes, it would have been all day with you.\\" The man with Champ then asked a boy in the room if he had any money, the boy replied no, and the man pulled out a $10 Confederate note and told him that would keep him in tobacco. Champ then asked Shocker, \\"Do you know Lieutenant Smith?\\" and Shocker replied no. Champ then said to Shocker, \\"Yes you do you damned Yankee, you know him well enough, but you don’t want to know him now. Where is he, then?\\" Shocker did not reply to Ferguson, and Ferguson got up to leave and told Shocker, \\"I have a begrudge against Smith; we’ll find him.\\" The Smith that Ferguson was referring to was Lieutenant Elza C. Smith of the 13th Kentucky Cavalry. The twenty-nine-year-old Smith was a relative of Ferguson's first wife. Smith had joined the 13th in Clinton County, Kentucky, in 1863, and spent much of his service chasing down terrorists such as Ferguson. Ferguson was a confederate sympathizer in an area that was predominantly Union. Ferguson saw it as his duty to form a guerrilla party to attack Union sympathizers. According to Thurman Sensing, Ferguson's biographer, Smith's death was the culmination of eleven murders. Ferguson allegedly suffered at the hands of his pro-Union neighbors during the war. Dr. J. B. Murfree stated that Smith made Ferguson's wife undress and march around before him along a public road. Sensing then concludes that with the death of Smith, his family honor was restored. Ferguson then attempted to ascend one of the stairways in the hospital to gain access to the third floor. The guard that was placed by Dr. Murfree and the quartermaster to keep the federal soldiers on the third floor stopped Ferguson and the men with him. The band of raiders advanced on the guard swearing that they would get up the steps in spite of the guard. Undaunted, the guard raised his gun and leveled it at Ferguson and told him that he would shoot him if he approached another step. Angrily, Ferguson and the men left that guard to find another way up the stairs. Ferguson, unable to secure the first guard, found it much easier to pass the second. After ascending to the second floor, Ferguson left his own guard at the steps to stop anyone who might come looking for him. Three Confederate soldiers came into the room of Orange Sells, Lieutenant Smith, and Captain Dagenfeld, of the 12th Ohio Cavalry. Ferguson, flanked by one unknown man, and Hildreth, (rank unknown), walked into the room without saying a word, pulled out his musket and stopped directly in front of Sells's bed. Lieutenant Smith recognized Ferguson as he reached the middle of the floor and moaned, \\"Champ, is that you?\\" Ferguson made no reply, but jerked his gun up to point at Smith and hit the breech with his right hand. He then looked at Smith and asked, \\"Smith, do you see this?\\" Smith then begged Ferguson not to shoot saying, \\"Champ, for God's sake, don’t shoot me here.\\" Ferguson then put the gun to Smith's head and shot three times before the gun went off. The ball hit Smith in the side of the forehead and went through the other ear. Five witnesses in the hospital testified at the trial of Champ Ferguson that they heard or saw Ferguson shoot Smith. Even the Rebel quartermaster's sergeant, A.J. Watkins, testified that he saw Smith dead in his bed promptly after hearing a shot. No one said anything after Smith begged Ferguson not to shoot. Ferguson's partner in crime at the hospital, Hildreth, had been watching the event with a carbine in one hand and a pistol in the other guarding the Federal wounded in the room. After the shot, Hildreth turned to Ferguson and said, \\"Champ, be sure your work is well done.\\" After examining the body, Ferguson concluded, \\"He is damned dead.\\" Dr. Murfree was at the office of the hospital when a nurse came in saying a lot of soldiers had killed a man in the hospital. Dr. Murfree and Major Stringfield, an officer in the Army of Virginia, took off to the hospital. Upon reaching the hospital, the pair was confronted by one of Ferguson's men that was guarding the steps with drawn revolvers. Dr. Murfree told the man to go downstairs, but the man replied that Captain Ferguson had ordered him to no let anyone pass. Dr. Murfree pushed past the guard while Major Stringfield remained behind to contend with the guard. Dr. Murfree met Ferguson on the next set of steps flanked by his armed guard. Ferguson was yelling loudly that he intended to kill all the Federal officers in Smith's room. This included Colonel Hanson of the 37th Kentucky Volunteers, and Captain Degenfeld of the 12th Ohio Cavalry. Dr. Murfree exclaimed, \\"Gentlemen, you must go down from here; this is a place for the sick and wounded, and you must not disturb them,\\" to which Ferguson retorted, \\"I will shoot you.\\" Dr. Murfree repeated his sentiment, stating that he was in charge of the hospital before Champ Ferguson advanced to within three feet of Dr. Murfree and said, \\"I don’t care who you are, damn you, I will kill you.\\" Abruptly, Lieutenant Philpot, of Ferguson's company stepped in between the pair and motioned that they should leave. The group then mounted their horses and rode off shouting, \\"We have killed the man that killed Hamilton.\\" The most interesting point that Dr. Murfree makes is that the group ran off yelling that they had avenged Hamilton. One other witness made reference to Captain Hamilton in the trial of Champ Ferguson. This circumstance refutes Sensing's conclusions that he was murdered due to his heinous acts. Aftermath The Federal prisoners at Emory and Henry College Hospital appear to have been treated well by the Confederate staff. One soldier said that he \\"was treated first rate while in the hospital.\\" The board of trustees at Emory and Henry College met on November 12, 1864 to discuss the running of the hospital. They stated that the grounds were well taken care of; in fact, improvements were made to the facilities during the war. Unlike many schools during the Civil War, Emory and Henry College suffered no structural damage as result of the war. The only damage done in the hospital was to furniture and was repaired or paid for by the Confederate States of America. Following the massacres on the field and at the Hospital, both Union and Confederate commands started receiving reports of inhumane acts. The story made its way all the way to the Secretary of War in Washington; he demanded the extradition of Ferguson to Federal authorities. In the case that the Confederacy refused to send Ferguson, the secretary said that \\"immediate retaliation [will] be enforced upon such Confederate prisoners as we may have in our possession, man for man.\\" Bibliography =Primary sources= *Emory and Henry College Board of Trustees, Minutes of the Board of Trustees.

His output consisted mainly of symphonies, concertos, chamber and instrumental music. Life Leyendecker studied composition with Ingo Schmitt (1962–1965) and Rudolf Petzold (1965–1970), and piano with Günter Ludwig. In 1971 he became a lecturer at the Hamburg Academy for Music and Performing Arts, and in 1976 he was appointed Professor of Composition and Theory at the Hamburg Music and Theatre Hochschule. In 1994, he became Professor of Composition at the State Hochschule for Music and the Performing Arts of Heidelberg-Mannheim. Music Leyendecker's music, although not serial, is largely atonal, but often with subtle hints of tonality. He employed regular time signatures in his pieces, but it sometimes does not sound that way, for he utilized carefully calculated and complex rhythms.

(2011) \\"Architecture-driven modelling methodologies.\\" In: Proceedings of the 2011 conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases XXII. Anneli Heimbürger et al. (eds). IOS Press. p. 98 An architecture description is a formal description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system. A system architecture can consist of system components and the sub-systems developed, that will work together to implement the overall system. There have been efforts to formalize languages to describe system architecture, collectively these are called architecture description languages (ADLs).Paul C. Clements (1996) \\"A survey of architecture description languages.\\" Proceedings of the 8th international workshop on software specification and design.

Taylor (2000). \\"A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages.\\" Software Engineering, IEEE Transactions on 26.1 (2000): 70-93.  Overview  Various organizations can define systems architecture in different ways, including: * The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and to the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.From ANSI/IEEE 1471-2000. * A representation of a system, including a mapping of functionality onto hardware and software components, a mapping of the software architecture onto the hardware architecture, and human interaction with these components.From the Carnegie Mellon University's Software Engineering Institute. * An allocated arrangement of physical elements which provides the design solution for a consumer product or life-cycle process intended to satisfy the requirements of the functional architecture and the requirements baseline.From The Human Engineering Home Page's Glossary. * An architecture consists of the most important, pervasive, top-level, strategic inventions, decisions, and their associated rationales about the overall structure (i.e., essential elements and their relationships) and associated characteristics and behavior.From OPEN Process Framework (OPF) Repository . * A description of the design and contents of a computer system. If documented, it may include information such as a detailed inventory of current hardware, software and networking capabilities; a description of long-range plans and priorities for future purchases, and a plan for upgrading and/or replacing dated equipment and software.From The National Center for Education Statistics glossary. * A formal description of a system, or a detailed plan of the system at component level to guide its implementation.TOGAF * The composite of the design architectures for products and their life-cycle processes.From IEEE 1220-1998 as found at their glossary . * The structure of components, their interrelationships, and the principles and guidelines governing their design and evolution over time.TOGAF One can think of system architecture as a set of representations of an existing (or future) system. These representations initially describe a general, high-level functional organization, and are progressively refined to more detailed and concrete descriptions. System architecture conveys the informational content of the elements consisting of a system, the relationships among those elements, and the rules governing those relationships. The architectural components and set of relationships between these components that an architecture description may consist of hardware, software, documentation, facilities, manual procedures, or roles played by organizations or people. A system architecture primarily concentrates on the internal interfaces among the system's components or subsystems, and on the interface(s) between the system and its external environment, especially the user. (In the specific case of computer systems, this latter, special, interface is known as the computer human interface, AKA human computer interface, or HCI; formerly called the man-machine interface.) One can contrast a system architecture with system architecture engineering (SAE) - the method and discipline for effectively implementing the architecture of a system: The Method Framework for Engineering System Architectures, Donald Firesmith et al., 2008 * SAE is a method because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or to change the architecture of a system within a set of constraints. * SAE is a discipline because a body of knowledge is used to inform practitioners as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints.  History  Systems architecture depends heavily on practices and techniques which were developed over thousands of years in many other fields, perhaps the most important being civil architecture. * Prior to the advent of digital computers, the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the term \\"system\\" as it is still commonly used today. However, with the arrival of digital computers and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts, software artifacts, and the combined artifacts. A programmable hardware artifact, or computing machine, that lacks its computer program is impotent; even as a software artifact, or program, is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable (hardware) machine. However, a hardware machine and its programming can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks. Within the computer and software engineering disciplines (and, often, other engineering disciplines, such as communications), then, the term system came to be defined as containing all of the elements necessary (which generally includes both hardware and software) to perform a useful function. * * Consequently, within these engineering disciplines, a system generally refers to a programmable hardware machine and its included program. And a systems engineer is defined as one concerned with the complete device, both hardware and software and, more particularly, all of the interfaces of the device, including that between hardware and software, and especially between the complete device and its user (the CHI). The hardware engineer deals (more or less) exclusively with the hardware device; the software engineer deals (more or less) exclusively with the computer program; and the systems engineer is responsible for seeing that the program is capable of properly running within the hardware device, and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment, especially the user, and performing its intended function. * * A systems architecture makes use of elements of both software and hardware and is used to enable design of such a composite system. A good architecture may be viewed as a 'partitioning scheme,' or algorithm, which partitions all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements into a workable set of cleanly bounded subsystems with nothing left over. That is, it is a partitioning scheme which is exclusive, inclusive, and exhaustive. A major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the sub systems so that there is a minimum of interdependencies needed among them. In both software and hardware, a good sub system tends to be seen to be a meaningful \\"object\\". Moreover, a good architecture provides for an easy mapping to the user's requirements and the validation tests of the user's requirements. Ideally, a mapping also exists from every least element to every requirement and test. *  Types  Several types of systems architectures (underlain by the same fundamental principlesfundamental principles of Systems Architecture, by Boris Golden) have been identified as follows:The Art of Systems Architecture, Mark Maier and Eberhardt Rechtin, 2nd ed 2002 * Hardware architecture * Software architecture * Enterprise architecture * Collaborative systems architectures(such as the Internet, intelligent transportation systems, and joint air defense systems) * Manufacturing systems architectures * Strategic systems architectureChoosing A Strategic Systems Architecture, by Brad Day  See also  * Arcadia (engineering) * Architectural pattern (computer science) * Department of Defense Architecture Framework * Enterprise architecture framework * Enterprise information security architecture * Method Framework for Engineering System Architectures * Process architecture * Requirements analysis * Software architecture * Software engineering * Systems architect * Systems analysis * Systems design * Systems engineering  References   External links  *Principles of system architecture *What is Systems Architecture ? *INCOSE Systems Architecture Working Group *Journal of Systems Architecture Category:Systems engineering Category:Software architecture ","title":"Systems architecture"},{"id":"3403329","text":"Durgon is an unincorporated community in Hardy County, West Virginia, USA.

The Court held that an offence based on possession, such as possession of a narcotic, requires the Crown to prove that the accused had subjective knowledge of the nature of the object in possession. Background Louis Beaver and his brother Max Beaver were arrested selling heroin to an undercover RCMP officer and charged with possession and sale of an illegal narcotic under the Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. Max was the one in actual physical possession of the drug but Louis was charged by association as he knew Max had the heroin. In defence, Louis claimed that he thought the package was milk sugar and that they were only trying to defraud the RCMP officer. At trial, the judge instructed the jury by telling them that if they find that they were in possession their actual knowledge was irrelevant. The issue before the Supreme Court was whether a conviction based on possession requires knowledge of the nature of the object. Opinion of the Court The Court held that knowledge was required. Cartwright J., writing for the majority stated that it is a fundamental principle of criminal law that the Mens rea of an element of an offence must be proven to secure a conviction. It has been established that provisions in the Drug Act are criminal law, and that any offence that allows a punishment of prison requires proof of mens rea. The Court held that Beaver did not know the character of the substance, and he was acquitted of possession. However, he did represent the substance as a narcotic and therefore was convicted on the charge of selling a narcotic.

He served as the head football coach at James Madison University (JMU) from 1999 to 2013, compiling a record of 109–71. Matthews coached the 2004 James Madison Dukes football team to an NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship. Early coaching career Matthews started his coaching career as an assistant coach at Lamar Consolidated High School, in Texas, working with offensive backs. During the 1978 season, he joined Kansas State University, as an assistant coach. During the 1980 and 1981 seasons, he served as the defensive coordinator athis alma mater, West Texas State—now known as West Texas A&M; University. From 1982 to 1985, he was an assistant coach at the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP). In the following 1986 season, he worked at the University of Houston as a defensive backs coach. In the 1987 season, he held that same position at Texas Christian University (TCU). During the 1988 and 1989 seasons, he coached at Southwest Texas State University—now known as Texas State University. From 1990 to 1995, he served as the assistant head coach at Marshall University. From 1996 to 1998 he coached defensive backs and linebackers at the University of Georgia. The Georgia Bulldogs won two bowl games during his tenure. At Georgia, Matthews coached Champ Bailey, a consensus selection to the 1998 College Football All-America Team and the Washington Redskins first-round choice in the 1999 NFL Draft. Matthews left Georgia in January 1999 to become the defensive coordinator at Baylor University, but resigned two months later to take the head coaching position at James Madison University. Career at James Madison From 1999 to 2013, Matthews was the head coach at James Madison University. The team had gone 3–8 in the year before, but Matthews turned them around that season and led them to an 8–4 record, an Atlantic 10 Conference title, and the school's first postseason appearance since 1995. Matthews won the Eddie Robinson Award that year, annually given to the top head coach in NCAA Division I-AA football. Five years later, after failing to make the postseason four years in a row, the Dukes finally made the playoffs again. They became the first team to win three straight road games on the way to an NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship, defeating the Montana Grizzlies, 31–21, in the 2004 Championship Game. The Dukes made the playoffs again in 2006 and 2007, losing in the first round each time. On February 25, 2008, amidst rumors that he might leave James Madison to help start the football program at the University of South Alabama, Matthews signed an extension with JMU to coach through the 2012 season. On September 27, 2008, JMU beat University of Maine 24–10, earning Matthews his 68th career win at JMU to become the school's all-time winningest coach. On November 22, 2008, the Matthews led Dukes defeated Towson University to finish conference play undefeated, winning the CAA outright and qualifying for their third straight FCS playoff appearance. On January 7, 2010, Matthews signed a one-year extension to his contract which extended through the 2013 season. During the 2012 season, Matthews gained his 100th career win in a hard-fought, 13–10 victory against conference foe Towson. On November 25, 2013, JMU athletic director Jeff Bourne announced that Matthews had been fired. This came after the Dukes finished the 2013 season 6–6 and missed the FCS playoffs for the fourth time since advancing to the NCAA Semifinals in 2008. =2010 Virginia Tech victory= On September 10, 2010, the Dukes upset then #13 Virginia Tech, 21–16 in front of 66,233 at Lane Stadium in Blacksburg. James Madison became the second FCS team in college football history to knock off a ranked FBS opponent, the other being Appalachian State over then #5 Michigan in 2007. Later that season the Hokies went on to win the ACC Championship and finished ranked #15, making the JMU upset even more remarkable, especially considering that the Dukes finished the season with a 6–5 record (5–5 against FCS competition). After the game, Matthews referred to the victory as \\"the biggest win in my professional career\\"—even bigger than the 2004 national championship. Post-JMU career After his firing, Matthews joined Coastal Carolina as defensive coordinator in 2016. On December 7, 2017, he announced his retirement from coaching. In 2019, he was hired by Dallas Renegades head coach Bob Stoops as linebackers and defensive quality control coach.

It is a private coeducational secondary school (German: Gymnasium). Currently, the school has approximately 230 students, 170 of whom are boarders who live on campus. The school was established by educator Kurt Hahn in 1932 and from the beginning accepted girls and boys. Under the Nazi regime, Hahn was forced to emigrate to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun School as well as later Outward Bound, Round Square and the United World Colleges.  Location  The school is in the postal district of Hinterzarten, although much of the building lies on the territory of neighbouring Breitnau. The building Studio 1 lies on the boundary and is thus used occasionally for joint council meetings between the two municipalities which, according to municipal rules, must take place on their own soil.  Educational philosophy  The school stands in the tradition of progressive education reform, or \\"reform pedagogy\\" as it is called in Germany. This movement originated in the 1920s. Among other things, Birklehof prides itself in giving students real responsibility in the running of the school. Student representatives have voting rights on all educational matters in general conferences.  History  Birklehof was founded in 1932 by German educator Kurt Hahn. The old Birklehof is a grade-listed farmhouse dating back to 1550. In the early 1920s, a villa was built on the Birklehof estate by a German industrialist. The estate was then given to Hahn for his school. Hahn, after being driven from Germany by the Nazis, went on to found Gordonstoun in Scotland in 1934 and Atlantic College in 1962. It is also a sister school to the more famous Schloss Salem, founded by Hahn in 1920. In 1946, it was reopened by its then head, German philosopher Georg Picht.  Developments  In 2009, the newest building project was completed with the inauguration of the rebuilt Neubirkle boarding house. This state-of-art eco building will be home to 19 boarders and two teachers' families. It also boasts a flat for a boarding house assistant. In the academic year 2010—11, the school will launch a new third middle-school stream. In addition to Foreign Languages or Sciences, students of Years 8 to 10 will be able to choose a musical specialisation. This will include aspects of drama, film making, fine arts and music. It follows an integrated, project-based approach. Furthermore, the school is in the process of switching to 8 instead of 9 years of grammar school, which will be implemented fully in 2012.  Boarding Houses  Birklehof school currently has ten boarding houses. Reflecting its educational philosophy, all houses (with the exception of the Neuer Hirschen West and Neuer Hirschen Ost) have integrated teaching rooms and teachers' flats as well as students' bedrooms. With the exception of the coeducational Unterhaus (Years 5-7) they are all single-sex houses, supervised by a resident houseparent. * Haupthaus (1923) * Neubirkle (2009) * Studio * Saalbau * Wolffsburg * Kopphaus * Neuer Hirschen West * Neuer Hirschen Ost * Petersbau * Unterhaus  Notable alumni  * Karl Heinz Bohrer, German literary scholar and essayist * Caio Koch-Weser, politician, economist, former vice president and managing director of the World Bank * Uwe Nettelbeck, German record producer, journalist and film critic * Herbert Girardet, author, visiting professor at various universities in England, program director of the World Future Council * Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker, German scientist and politician  References   Literature  * Teresa Löwe: Georg Picht und die Schule Birklehof in der Nachkriegszeit (1946–1955) (PDF-Datei; 170 kB), Berlin 2004 * Karl Heinz Bohrer: Granatsplitter - Erzählung einer Jugend, dtb, München 2014, S. 137ff * Stefan Würthle (MA thesis Freiburg, 2nd. edition 1998) Der Birklehof - Ein deutsches Landerziehungsheim in nationalsozialistischer Zeit.
