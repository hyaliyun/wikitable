Allinson's translation was first published in London by Methuen in 1904 under the title The Wolf-Leader; the first American edition, edited and somewhat cut by L. Sprague de Camp and illustrated by Mahlon Blaine, was issued under the present title by Prime Press in 1950. The text was also serialized in eight parts in the pulp magazine Weird Tales in the issues for August, 1931-March, 1932. Plot summary Le Meneur de Loups is set around 1780 in Dumas' native town of Villers-Cotterêts, and is supposedly based on a local folk-tale Dumas heard as a child. The story concerns Thibault, a shoe-maker, who is beaten by the gamekeeper of the Lord of Vez for interfering with the lord's hunting. Afterwards he encounters a huge wolf, walking on its hind legs like a man, who offers him vengeance; Thibault may wish harm on any person in return for one of his own hairs for each wish. To seal the agreement, the two exchange rings. As a result of this bargain he also finds himself able to command the local wolves, and hence gradually gains the reputation of being a werewolf. Thibault's first two wishes kill the gamekeeper and injure the Lord of Vez. The wishes turn two hairs on his head long and red, as do his subsequent ones, which, though equally successful, also backfire against him in unexpected ways, leaving him scorned and hated by others in his community. Finally one of his wishes causes him to trade bodies with Lord Raoul of Vauparfond, who is having an affair with the wife of the Count de Mont-Gobert. Caught with the lady by the count as the result of an earlier wish against Lord Raoul, he is mortally wounded. He manages to keep himself alive until transferred back into his own body, only to find himself trapped in his own home, to which the townsfolk have set fire. Escaping, Thibault takes to the forest, where he subsists on animals caught for him by his wolves and hunts and is hunted by the Lord of Vez. He has but one human hair left on his head. The conclusion of the book, however, brings him an unusual redemption. Critical reception In 1951, Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas reviewed the 1950 Prime Press edition and placed it among \\"Dumas's drabbest hack-work.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, June 1951, p.84 Discussing the werewolf theme in literature, Franz Rottensteiner described The Wolf-Leader as \\"considerably superior from a literary point of view\\".Franz Rottensteiner, The Fantasy Book:an illustrated history from Dracula to Tolkien.

This company, based in Louisville, Kentucky, manufactured the cast iron book stacks found in libraries all over the world in the beginning of the 20th century including the Washington DC Public Library and Harvard's Widener Library. After World War I Angus Snead Macdonald would lead Snead and Company to revolutionize and standardize library book stacks. Innovations in library shelving With the success of the public library movement of the mid-19th century came the rapid expansion of library construction in the United States. Macdonald took advantage of this expansion to revolutionize a number of library features. In 1915 Snead standardized the length of a book shelf to three feet in order to reduce cost and create interchangeable parts. The company also standardized the stack range spacing to four feet six inches.Baumann, 1972, p. 128 In 1930 the company developed a standardized lighting system that reflected light evenly to all parts of the stacks. In 1950, when developing for the Midwest Inter- Library Center, Snead and Company developed the first compact shelving units.Baumann, 1972, p. 165 These developments kept pace with Snead's ideal to provide libraries that \\"stressed flexibility, economy, informational comfort, and a reliance on artificial illumination and ventilation.\\"Baumann, 1972, p. 223 The most important influences that Macdonald has had on libraries have been his architectural designs advocating open stacks in the 1930s, and his company’s modular architecture in the 1950s. The Snead Company's production of public and academic libraries in the beginning of the 20th century provided the framework for open stack libraries. The company's focus on providing book stacks that could also be modified to accommodate card catalogues or reading spaces helped the expanding use of public libraries following World War II. The concept of modular libraries not only signaled the financial demise of Snead and Company, but also the birth of the modern library form. Composed of nine by nine by eight foot sections or \\"modules\\", this concept, combined with the production of light-weight, adjustable shelving, revolutionized library planning. Macdonald and the company he headed were integral in the move of the American library system from one of closed, structural stacks, to open stacks that emphasize adjustability which are still in use today.

EurepGAP is a common standard for farm management practice created in the late 1990s by several European supermarket chains and their major suppliers. GAP is an acronym for Good Agricultural Practices. It is now the world's most widely implemented farm certification scheme. Most European customers for agricultural products now demand evidence of EurepGAP certification as a prerequisite for doing business. The standard was developed using the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) guidelines published by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and is governed according to the ISO Guide 65 for certifications schemes. Unlike other farm certification schemes, it has definitive rules for growers to follow, and each production unit is assessed by independent third party auditors. These auditors work for commercial certification companies who are licensed by the EurepGAP secretariat to conduct audits and award certificates where merited. In September 2007, EurepGAP changed its name to GLOBALG.A.P.. The decision was taken to reflect its expanding international role in establishing Good Agricultural Practices between multiple retailers and their suppliers. A series of the standards can be accessed online. In February 2009 GLOBALG.A.P. launched 'ChinaGAP' following successful completion of the benchmarking of ChinaGAP against the GLOBALG.A.P.

History The Cygnet was designed at Slough by C.W. Aircraft Limited in 1936. It was the first all-metal stressed-skin lightplane to be built and flown in the United Kingdom. It was first flown in May 1937 at London Air Park, Hanworth. The sole prototype, constructed by C.W. Aircraft, had a tailwheel undercarriage and low cantilever wing, the outer panel of which wad tapered and had dihedral. Two persons sat side by side in an enclosed cabin. The metal airframe employed a semi-monocoque tailcone. Atop the tailcone sat a one-piece tailplane, with dual fins at the tailplane's ends. The inverted piston engine drove a two-blade propeller. The first Cygnet with original tail and undercarriage During that period C.W. Aircraft had invested heavily in another design, the C.W. Swan. Overextended, it became insolvent and sold all rights for the Cygnet to General Aircraft Ltd in 1938. General Aircraft modified the design to incorporate a nosewheel undercarriage and designated it the GAL.42 Cygnet II. Production of a large batch of aircraft began in 1939 but only 10 were built and delivered (1939–1941) due to the start of the Second World War. Five aircraft were impressed into service with the Royal Air Force as tricycle-undercarriage trainers for aircrews slated to man the American-made Douglas Boston. Another two were used by the government for various liaison duties but retained their civilian markings. A trainer version of the Cygnet II was designed with an open cockpit as the GAL.45 Owlet. Surviving aircraft Cygnet G-AGBN, National Museum of Flight, East Fortune, Scotland (2010) There are two known survivors of the 11 examples produced. The last flying survivor, company number 111 and registered as G-AGBN (ES915), was retired in 1988 and is now on display at the National Museum of Flight at East Fortune, Scotland. It was a part of the Strathallan Collection owned by Sir William 'Willy' James Denby Roberts until the dissolution of the collection. The National Museum of Flight failed to acquire it but the bidding was taken over by Victor Gauntlett who donated to the museum. A civilian version was operated in south Argentina, in Tierra del Fuego province where it was damaged in a landing incident. After being repaired and being flown for several years, it was landed at a short airstrip in Colón and was unable to depart therefrom. It remained there and subsequently was converted into a monument at the Air Club entrance. In 2008 it was reported to be in poor condition.

It is the only high school in the Rootstown Local School District. Their nickname is the Rovers. History Previous home of the school from 1917–1966 Rootstown High School was established in 1884 and met in a small building adjacent to the town hall a few blocks south of the current campus. This building housed high school students and grade levels, though many students in the township attended smaller schoolhouses spread across 10 rural districts. At the time, Rootstown Township was still divided into several smaller school districts and the high school was not fully accredited. The first class graduated in 1893. During the early 20th century, the smaller districts were gradually consolidated. Following construction of a new building that opened in 1917, the remaining districts in the township consolidated to the new central building and Rootstown High School became a fully accredited four-year high school. The centralized school, known as the Rootstown Township School, had additions built in 1938, 1950, and 1954. In 1958, population and enrollment growth necessitated construction of a separate elementary school, which was built immediately north of the building, and the existing building continued to house the junior high and high school grades. Following the completion of a new high school building, the original building became Rootstown Middle School. Main entrance The current school building opened in 1966 and is located on the north end of the Rootstown Schools campus. The building, which also houses the Rootstown Local School District administrative offices, is named in honor of Ward W. Davis, who served as president of the Rootstown School Board for a number of years, including when the current facility opened. As of 2015, the school houses around 450 students in grades 9–12. Adjacent to the east of the high school is Robert C. Dunn Field, which includes a cinder running track, named for a former RHS principal and football coach. It is used for football, soccer, and track and field. The campus also has athletic fields for baseball and softball. Academics Vocational and career education programs are available through Maplewood Career Center in Ravenna, which serves from Rootstown and nine additional school districts in Portage and Summit counties. The school offers 21 programs that are available to students in the 11th and 12th grades. Athletics Rootstown High School athletic teams are known as the Rovers and the school colors are navy blue and white. Since 2005, the school has competed as a member of the Portage Trail Conference County Division. Prior to 2005, Rootstown was a long-time member of the Portage County League. All Rover athletic teams play their home games on the Rootstown Schools campus with a few exceptions. The bowling and golf teams play their home matches at other nearby locations. Bowling matches are held at Twin Star Lanes in Brady Lake, and the golf team hosts home matches at the Kent State University Golf Course in Franklin Township, both just east of Kent. The first interpretation of the word Rover at Rootstown was a dog; a collie or German shepherd. In 1960 a new version of the mascot was adopted: the Rover that is defined as \\"a pirate, a wanderer, or a roamer\\" in Webster's Dictionary. The Rovers logo is a ship that is meant to symbolize the Norsemen. The current version of the nickname came into existence in the early years of RHS sports. The Rovers did not have a facility in which to engage in competitive sporting activities, thus they would \\"wander and roam\\" to other schools for sports, pirating victories. Rootstown fields the following varsity teams: Fall sports *Boys cross country *Girls cross country *Football *Boys golf *Boys soccer *Girls soccer *Girls volleyball Winter sports *Boys basketball *Girls basketball *Boys bowling *Girls bowling *Wrestling Spring sports *Baseball *Softball *Boys track and field *Girls track and field Rootstown has had three state track champion individuals: Roger Dietz Sr. won the low and high hurdles in 1957; Ron Nipuelio won the 400-meters in 1990; and Josh Morgan won the 3200-meters in 1996. Two Rover sports teams have been state semifinalists: the 1981 football team and the 2003 softball team. Victory Bell 350px Right next to the football field, there is a large brass bell. In the 1950s the bell was on a steam locomotive on the Erie-Lackawanna Railroad, and it was donated to Portage County and used as a football championship trophy. From 1957 to 1962, Rootstown won the bell for six straight years, and it was permanently awarded to them. The bell used to be mounted on a rolling platform and would be rolled down to the football field before each game so that the Rootstown Rover football team could ring the bell after each home victory. In 2013 a concrete pad was poured to mount the bell on, and an open-sided structure was built over the bell at the south end zone of Robert C. Dunn Field. The bell continues to be rung after each home victory.

It was founded c.1075 by Judith, Countess of Huntingdon, a niece of William the Conqueror, and therefore is classed as a royal foundation.  History  The modern church dedicated to St Mary and St Helen used to extend eastwards for some considerable distance, and contained a central tower, chancel, and Lady chapel. The foundation stones still reportedly cause much trouble to the sexton, though he sometimes unearths beautiful tiles from the old chancel floor. The monastery was known to have been involved in numerous lawsuits, with an array of monasteries including that of Dunstable Priory, Newhouse and St Albans Abbey, concerning the advowson of various parishes. The nuns often appear to have resorted to aggressive behaviour. There was further trouble in the 14th century when the nearby hospital of St Leonard needed to close and divert a footpath used by the abbey, for the purpose of building construction. The abbess objected and even following a lawsuit in which the abbey lost, they still prevented the work for a further two years until the hospital successfully sought intervention by the Crown, obtaining letters patent. Further incidents followed: > In 1337 Elizabeth Morteyn, who was then abbess, claimed the 'third penny' > from the town of Bedford, in virtue of an alleged grant from Malcolm IV, > King of Scotland; the case was carried before Parliament, and the burgesses > were successful in proving that Malcolm never had any lordship in the town. There were numerous reports and complaints of unorthodox behaviour, with a visiting bishop commenting that there was 'too much wandering of the nuns out of the monastery.' Also, as many of the nuns and usually the abbess came from high ranking families, they had friends at court who often visited and even stayed in the monastery purely for social reasons. Some 'secular' women even seem to have been living in the monastery and eventually Bishop Gynwell ordered that none were to stay except those granted a special licence to do so. Even so, in 1379 Bishop Buckingham had to order the abbess to dismiss all secular persons from the monastery. Various records of subsequent years show that little ever improved and if anything the monastery became increasingly secularised, with the nuns maintaining individual households, dining with friends and wearing secular clothing. Successive attempts at intervention seem to have been unsuccessful and probably ignored. Apparently there used to be a separate Parish Church for the villagers, but this was destroyed about 1500, and the Abbey church was afterwards fitted up for public worship, and dedicated to the Holy Trinity.  The Dissolution and beyond  There were twenty-three nuns in residence besides the abbess, Elizabeth Boyvill, when the monastery was closed in 1539, all of whom were then pensioned off. The land then passed to Edmund Harvey. Following the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the majority of the church nave was blocked off and retained for parish use. The remainder of the church was demolished after 1580. In 1616 Sir Thomas Hillersdon purchased the remaining monastic buildings and incorporated them into a new house, which itself later became a ruin. The church contains some 15th-century brasses, 17th-century and later tombs and furnishings. Another survivor of the monastery is a small vaulted building on the south side of the church, originally a parlour and now used as a vestry. Building 250px Three bays of the church are Norman, (about 1075); the two western bays are of Early English style, about 1225. In 1539, during the suppression, much was lost. By 1580, the east end had been completed, with a west window, and detached tower. A watercolour by Thomas Fisher (c.1815) shows a timber-framed north porch. From 1823 to 1828, restoration work was done. Around 1860, a vestry on the north side of the church was demolished. From 1880 to 1882 restoration work was done, by architect Thomas Jobson Jackson. In 1883 and 1885, the John Bunyan stained glass windows by the firm of Camm Brothers were added in the east wall. It became a listed building on 13 July 1964.

SR 30 will be broken into three sections. The western section will run from SR 85 to Loop 303, the center section from Loop 303 to Loop 202, and the eastern section from Loop 202 to Interstate 17.http://www.bqaz.org/pdf/cphx/CPHX_13-08-26_Freeway- System-Plan.pdf History In November 2004, voters in Maricopa County approved an extension to an existing sales tax funding transportation improvements. A significant portion of those funds will go toward improvements of I-10, which experiences significant volumes of traffic in the southwest part of the Phoenix metro area. However, rapid growth in the neighboring communities of Avondale, Buckeye, and Goodyear is expected to worsen the congestion on the interstate in spite of improvements, necessitating the construction of a reliever route. The route, then known as State Route 801 (SR 801) was planned to run parallel to I-10 through the cities and provide relief. Although no construction has begun for the route, planning documents have identified a study area running roughly south of and parallel to I-10 through largely undeveloped land. In addition to reducing commuter traffic on I-10, SR 30 will run near the industrial and warehouse district in southwest Phoenix, allowing the significant truck traffic that services these districts to avoid commuter traffic, and as such is envisioned as an alternate truck route eventually connecting to Loop 303, SR 85, and the planned alignment of future Interstate 11. In response to a projected budget shortfall of $6.6 billion brought on by the recession, the Maricopa Association of Governments voted to suspend funding to numerous projects during a meeting on October 28, 2009. While not removing the freeway from the long-term regional transportation plan, the removal of the funding will effectively postpone the construction of the route until at least 2026. The plan had originally indicated a construction timeline between 2021 and 2025. In October 2016, it was announced that ADOT was exploring the possibility of building SR 30 as a toll road to accelerate its construction. The toll feasibility study took six months. On October 26, 2017, local mayors officially named SR 30 the Tres Rios Freeway after the nearby Gila, Agua Fria, and Salt rivers, which the proposed freeway will either parallel or be in the near proximity of.

He played hurling with his local club St. Rynagh's and with the Offaly senior inter-county team from 1990 until 2002. Playing career =Club= Rigney played his club hurling with the St. Rynagh's club in Banagher. He started playing hurling at the age of 11 and won his first medal at the age of 13 when his side defeated Portumna in Galway. As a member of the senior team Rigney captured three county titles in 1990, 1992 and 1993. This final win was later converted into a Leinster club title. =Inter- county= Rigney first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly minor hurling team in the late 1980s. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1989 before later capturing an All-Ireland title following a victory over Clare. Rigney later joined the Offaly under-21 team where he captured a Leinster title in 1991. He added a second Leinster under-21 medal to his collection in 1993, however, he never collected an All- Ireland medal in this grade. Rigney became a member of the Offaly senior panel in 1990. In the spring of 1991 he captured a National Hurling League title, Offaly's first, and the future was looking brighter for the midlands team. Three years later in 1994 Rigney was a key member of the Offaly team as he first Leinster title. Offaly later progressed to the All-Ireland final where they played Limerick. With four minutes to go Offaly were trailing by five points, however, a scoring spree in the remaining time resulted in the side winning the game by 6 points. Offaly manager Éamonn Cregan had orchestrated a great win over has native county and Rigney collected his first All-Ireland medal, while also picking up an All Star Award. In 1995 Rigney captured a second Leinster medal. The game itself against Kilkenny was regarded as the best game of the year and is regarded as one of the greatest games of all-time by some for the sheer level of skill displayed by both teams. Rigney's side later went on to lose the All-Ireland final to Clare, who won their first All- Ireland title since 1914. 1998 proved to be a controversial year for Offaly. Rigney's side reached the Leinster final but lost to Kilkenny. This defeat prompted their manager, Babs Keating, to describe the Offaly hurlers as \\"sheep in a heap\\", and he promptly resigned. It looked as if Offaly's championship hopes were in disarray, however, they overcame Antrim in the All-Ireland quarter-final and qualified to meet Clare in the semi-final, with Galway's Michael Bond now in charge. The first game ended in a draw and had to be replayed; however, the replay was ended minutes early because of a timekeeping error by the referee. Following a protest on the pitch of Croke Park by the Offaly supporters it was decided that Clare and Offaly would meet for a third time. Rigney's side won the third game and qualified to play Kilkenny in the final. Offaly reversed the Leinster final defeat by winning the All-Ireland final by 6 points in a game which saw Brian Whelahan play at full-forward. Rigney won his second All-Ireland medal and lifted the cup. In 1999 Offaly once again reached the latter stages of the All-Ireland championship, however, they were beaten by Cork in the All-Ireland semi-final. 2000 proved to be another controversial year. Team manager Pat Fleury surprisingly omitted Rigney from the squad that was due to play Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final. Offaly lost that game and Rigney later declared that he no longer wanted to play for his club St. Rynagh's or for Offaly. It was a withdrawal from hurling in protest. He was later coaxed back to the county team in 2001 and continued to play until his retirement in 2002.

Service  The regiment was originally formed from units of the Royal Reserve Regiments, independent battalions composed of reserve infantry called up for home duties in the United Kingdom as a large part of the regular forces were sent to South Africa for service in the Second Boer War. The Reserve Regiments only served in the UK and were phased out in 1901, when some of the units were instead regimented as the Royal Garrison Regiment. These units were sent to relieve regular infantry battalions in overseas garrisons; this would allow the regular battalions previously stationed there to be sent on active service in South Africa. In 1901, four battalions were raised. The 1st, 3rd and 4th battalions were sent to Malta, whilst the 2nd was sent to Gibraltar. In 1904, all four were moved to South Africa for garrison duty there as the regular units returned to normal duties. A fifth battalion was raised in 1902, for service in Canada; it garrisoned Halifax, Nova Scotia from October 1902 until 1905, when it handed over its role to the Permanent Active Militia. It was the last British garrison to be based in Canada proper. All five battalions were disbanded in 1906-7, and the regiment was disbanded in August 1908.

He is known for his theory on the effects of cosmic rays on cloud formation as an indirect cause of global warming.  Early life and education  Henrik Svensmark obtained a Master of Science in Engineering (Cand. Polyt) in 1985 and a Ph.D. in 1987 from the Physics Laboratory I at the Technical University of Denmark. Career Correlation between variations in cosmic ray flux (red) and change in sea temperature (black). Henrik Svensmark is director of the Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Danish Space Research Institute (DSRI), a part of the Danish National Space Center. He previously headed the sun-climate group at DSRI. He held postdoctoral positions in physics at three other organizations: University of California, Berkeley, Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, and the Niels Bohr Institute. In 1997, Svensmark and Eigil Friis-Christensen popularised a theory that linked galactic cosmic rays and global climate change mediated primarily by variations in the intensity of the solar wind, which they have termed cosmoclimatology. This theory had earlier been reviewed by Dickinson. One of the small-scale processes related to this link was studied in a laboratory experiment performed at the Danish National Space Center (paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society A, February 8, 2007). Svensmark's conclusions from his research downplay the significance of the effects of man-made increases in atmospheric CO2 on recent and historical global warming, with him arguing that while the climate change role of greenhouse gases is considerable, solar variations play a larger role. Cosmoclimatology theory of climate change Svensmark detailed his theory of cosmoclimatology in a paper published in 2007. The Center for Sun-Climate Research at the Danish National Space Institute \\"investigates the connection between solar activity and climatic changes on Earth\\". Its homepage lists several publications earlier works related to cosmoclimatology. Svensmark and Nigel Calder published a book The Chilling Stars: A New Theory of Climate Change (2007) describing the Cosmoclimatology theory that cosmic rays \\"have more effect on the climate than manmade CO2\\": ::\\"During the last 100 years cosmic rays became scarcer because unusually vigorous action by the Sun batted away many of them. Fewer cosmic rays meant fewer clouds—and a warmer world.\\"Svensmark, Henrik, \\"The Chilling Stars: A New Theory of Climate Change\\", Totem Books, 2007 () A documentary film on Svensmark's theory, The Cloud Mystery, was produced by Lars Oxfeldt MortensenThe Cloud Mystery The Documentary and premiered in January 2008 on Danish TV 2\\\\. In April 2012, Svensmark published an expansion of his theory in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society In the new work he claims that the diversity of life on Earth over the last 500 million years might be explained by tectonics affecting the sea-level together with variations in the local supernova rate, and virtually nothing else. This suggests that the progress of evolution is affected by climate variation depending on the Galactic Cosmic Ray flux. The director of DTU Space, Prof. Eigil Friis-Christensen, commented: \\"When this enquiry into effects of cosmic rays from supernova remnants began 16 years ago, we never imagined that it would lead us so deep into time, or into so many aspects of the Earth's history. The connection to evolution is a culmination of this work.\\" Experimental verification Preliminary experimental verification has been conducted in the SKY Experiment at the Danish National Space Science Center. CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, is preparing comprehensive verification in the CLOUD Project. =SKY Experiment= Svensmark conducted proof of concept experiments in the SKY Experiment at the Danish National Space Institute. > To investigate the role of cosmic rays in cloud formation low in the Earth's > atmosphere, the SKY experiment used natural muons (heavy electrons) that can > penetrate even to the basement of the National Space Institute in > Copenhagen. The hypothesis, verified by the experiment, is that electrons > released in the air by the passing muons promote the formation of molecular > clusters that are building blocks for cloud condensation nuclei. Critics of the hypothesis claimed that particle clusters produced measured just a few nanometres across, whereas aerosols typically need to have a diameter of at least 50 nm in order to serve as so-called cloud condensation nuclei. Further experiments by Svensmark and collaborators published in 2013Svensmark, Enghoff, Pedersen, Response of cloud condensation nuclei (>50 nm) to changes in ion-nucleation, Physics Letters A, Volume 377, Issue 37, 8 November 2013, Pages 2343–2347 that showed that aerosols with diameter larger than 50 nm are produced by ultraviolet light (from trace amounts of ozone, sulfur dioxide, and water vapor), large enough to serve as cloud condensation nuclei. =CLOUD Project Experiments= Scientists are preparing detailed atmospheric physics experiments to test Svensmark's thesis, building on the Danish findings. CERN started a multi-phase project in 2006, including rerunning the Danish experiment. CERN plans to use an accelerator rather than rely on natural cosmic rays. CERN's multinational project will give scientists a permanent facility where they can study the effects of both cosmic rays and charged particles in the Earth's atmosphere. CERN's project is named CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving OUtdoor Droplets). CERN posted a 2009 progress report on the CLOUD project. Kirkby, Jasper, The CLOUD Collaboration, CERN, Geneva, CERN- SPSC-2010-013 Experiments Committee, SPSC, April 7, 2010 On 25 August 2011, the first result of the experiment were published. They show that vapor traces, assumed until now to account for aerosol formation in the lower atmosphere can explain only a tiny fraction of the observed atmospheric aerosol production. The results also show that ionization from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation. CERN 2011 Press Release n°15 CERN’s CLOUD experiment provides unprecedented insight into cloud formation. Further positive laboratory results were published in 2013, although the application of these results to the actual atmosphere remained controversial. Dunne et al. (2016) have presented the main outcomes of 10 years of results obtained at the CLOUD experiment performed at CERN. They have studied in detail the physico- chemical mechanisms and the kinetics of aerosols formation. The nucleation process of water droplets/ice micro-crystals from water vapor reproduced in the CLOUD experiment and also directly observed in the Earth atmosphere do not only involve ions formation due to cosmic rays but also a range of complex chemical reactions with sulfuric acid, ammonia and organic compounds emitted in the air by human activities and by organisms living on land or in the oceans (plankton). Although they observe that a fraction of cloud nuclei is effectively produced by ionisation due to the interaction of cosmic rays with the constituents of Earth atmosphere, this process is insufficient to attribute the present climate modifications to the fluctuations of the cosmic rays intensity modulated by changes in the solar activity and Earth magnetosphere. Debate and controversy =Galactic Cosmic Rays vs Global Temperature= An early (2003) critique by physicist Peter Laut of Svensmark's theory reanalyzed Svensmark's data and suggested that it does not support a correlation between cosmic rays and global temperature changes; it also disputes some of the theoretical bases for the theory. Svensmark replied to the paper, stating that \\"...nowhere in Peter Laut’s (PL) paper has he been able to explain, where physical data have been handled incorrectly, how the character of my papers are misleading, or where my work does not live up to scientific standards\\" Henrik Svensmark, \\"Comments on Peter Laut’s paper: \\"Solar Activity and terrestrial climate: an analysis of some purported correlations\\" Mike Lockwood of the UK's Rutherford Appleton Laboratory and Claus Froehlich of the World Radiation Center in Switzerland published a paper in 2007 which concluded that the increase in mean global temperature observed since 1985 correlates so poorly with solar variability that no type of causal mechanism may be ascribed to it, although they accept that there is \\"considerable evidence\\" for solar influence on Earth's pre-industrial climate and to some degree also for climate changes in the first half of the 20th century. Svensmark's coauthor Calder responded to the study in an interview with LondonBookReview.com, where he put forth the counterclaim that global temperature has not risen since 1999.http://www.londonbookreview.com/interviews/nigelcalder.html LondonBookReview.com interview with Nigel Calder Later in 2007, Svensmark and Friis-Christensen brought out a Reply to Lockwood and Fröhlich which concludes that surface air temperature records used by Lockwood and Fröhlich apparently are a poor guide to Sun-driven physical processes, but tropospheric air temperature records do show an impressive negative correlation between cosmic- ray flux and air temperatures up to 2006 if a warming trend, oceanic oscillations and volcanism are removed from the temperature data. They also point out that Lockwood and Fröhlich present their data by using running means of around 10 years, which creates the illusion of a continued temperature rise, whereas all unsmoothed data point to a flattening of the temperature, coincident with the present maxing out of the magnetic activity of the Sun, and which the continued rapid increase in CO2 concentrations seemingly has been unable to overrule. =Galactic Cosmic Rays vs Cloud Cover= In April 2008, Professor Terry Sloan of Lancaster University published a paper in the journal Environmental Research Letters titled \\"Testing the proposed causal link between cosmic rays and cloud cover\\", which found no significant link between cloud cover and cosmic ray intensity in the last 20 years. Svensmark responded by saying \\"Terry Sloan has simply failed to understand how cosmic rays work on clouds\\". Dr. Giles Harrison of Reading University, describes the work as important \\"as it provides an upper limit on the cosmic ray-cloud effect in global satellite cloud data\\". Harrison studied the effect of cosmic rays in the UK. He states: \\"Although the statistically significant non-linear cosmic ray effect is small, it will have a considerably larger aggregate effect on longer timescale (e.g. century) climate variations when day-to-day variability averages out\\". Brian H. Brown (2008) of Sheffield University further found a statistically significant (p<0.05) short term 3% association between Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and low level clouds over 22 years with a 15-hour delay. Long-term changes in cloud cover (> 3 months) and GCR gave correlations of p=0.06. =Debate updates= More recently, Laken et al. (2012) found that new high quality satellite data show that the El Niño Southern Oscillation is responsible for most changes in cloud cover at the global and regional levels. They also found that galactic cosmic rays, and total solar irradiance did not have any statistically significant influence on changes in cloud cover. Lockwood (2012) conducted a thorough review of the scientific literature on the \\"solar influence\\" on climate. It was found that when this influence is included appropriately into climate models causal climate change claims such as those made by Svensmark are shown to have been exaggerated. Lockwood's review also highlighted the strength of evidence in favor of the solar influence on regional climates. Sloan and Wolfendale (2013) demonstrated that while temperature models showed a small correlation every 22 years, less than 14 percent of global warming since the 1950s could be attributed to cosmic ray rate. The study concluded that the cosmic ray rate did not match the changes in temperature, indicating that it was not a causal relationship. Another 2013 study found, contrary to Svensmark's claims, \\"no statistically significant correlations between cosmic rays and global albedo or globally averaged cloud height.\\" In 2013, a laboratory study by Svensmark, Pepke and Pedersen published in Physics Letters A showed, that there is in fact a correlation between cosmic rays and the formation of aerosols of the type that seed clouds. Extrapolating from the laboratory to the actual atmosphere, the authors asserted that solar activity is responsible for ca. 50 percent of temperature variation.http://videnskab.dk/miljo-naturvidenskab/nye- resultater-stotter-omstridt-klimateori In a detailed 2013 post on the scientists' blog RealClimate, Rasmus E. Benestad presented arguments for considering Svensmark's claims to be \\"wildly exaggerated\\". (Time magazine has characterized the main purpose of this blog as a \\"straightforward presentation of the physical evidence for global warming\\".)

Ferrani sang a wide repertoire that encompassed not only verismo opera but the works of composers like Verdi, Gounod, Wagner, and Debussy. Career Born Cesira Zanazzio, Ferrani studied with Antonietta Fricci in Turin before making her professional opera début in 1887 as Micaëla in Bizet's Carmen at the Teatro Regio di Torino. That same year she sang Gilda from Verdi's Rigoletto and Marguerite in Gounod's Faust at the same theater. Over the next four years she appeared in numerous productions in Catania, Genoa, and Venice. She also sang in several productions in France. In 1892 she appeared at the Teatro Carlo Felice as Amelia into Verdi's Simon Boccanegra and as the title role in Catalani's Loreley under Arturo Toscanini. Ferrani's costume for Act I of La bohème designed by Adolf Hohenstein for the world premiere On 1 February 1893, Ferrani sang the title role in the world premiere of Puccini's Manon Lescaut at the Teatro Regio di Torino. It was the first time of many that she would sing opposite Giuseppe Cremonini, who originated the role of Chevalier des Grieux. In 1894 Ferrani and Cremonini reprised their roles in Manon Lescaut's La Scala premiere and sang opposite each other in the world premiere of Alberto Franchetti's Il fior d'Alpe as Maria and Paolo. Ferrani later reprised the role of Manon in productions at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires and cities throughout Italy. In 1895 Ferrani sang the role of Suzel in L'amico Fritz at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo and created the title role in the world premiere of Giacomo Orefice's Consuelo at the Teatro Comunale di Bologna. The following year she portrayed the role of Mimì in the original production of Puccini's La bohème in Turin (1896). The day after the successful premiere of La bohème, with the cast receiving 15 curtain calls, Puccini gave Ferrani his photograph with the dedication: > \\"To my true and splendid Mimì, signorina Cesira Ferrani, with gratitude, G. > Puccini\\" Original Italian: \\"Alla mia vera e splendida Mimì, signorina Cesira > Ferrani, riconoscente G. Puccini\\", quoted in Franchi, February 2006 Following the success of La bohème, Ferrani embarked on performance tours of Russia and Spain, and appeared in productions in Cairo and Lisbon in addition to continuing to perform throughout Italy. In 1901 Ferrani sang in the world premiere of Mascagni's Le maschere at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa. At La Scala she sang Mélisande in the first Milan performance of Pelléas et Mélisande with Toscanini in 1908. Her other roles included Juliette from Roméo et Juliette, Fanny in Sapho, Charlotte from Werther, Amelia from Simon Boccanegra, Elisabeth in Tannhäuser, and both Elsa in Lohengrin and Eva in Die Meistersinger among others. Her final appearance was in 1909 as Mélisande.J. B. Steane: \\"Cesira Ferrani\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed February 10, 2009), (subscription access) In 1928 when the first recording of Puccini's Madama Butterfly was made, the Gramophone Company invited her out of retirement to sing Kate Pinkerton's handful of lines in Act 3.

Possessing an instantaneously recognizable voice, Fuld recorded throughout Europe and the Americas in many languages, including Yiddish, English, German, French, Hebrew and Dutch. His career after the war once again made his name popular throughout the world, and on the most prestigious night club and concert stages. At 83 he recorded his last record, claimed to be the Sergeant Pepper of Yiddish music. Early life Leo Fuld was the third of ten children from a poor Jewish family. His father, Louis Fuld, was a merchant in occasional goods. Fuld's talent for singing already showed at a young age during services in the synagogue. Fuld received a study grant for the Seminarium. His parents expected that the young Leo would develop into a \`chazzan', the chorister in the synagogue. On his sixteenth birthday, Fuld already began leading services in \`sjoels' in the province. At this time he would also sing secular music in bars. He made his debut in a Rotterdam bar where he sang sixty songs for one dollar. His initial successes led him to enter an audition at VARA-radio. Here he was taken on directly and made his debut beside Louis Davids. Fuld left for the United Kingdom in 1932 to audition at the BBC and was to become the first Dutch singer ever behind a BBC microphone. He was heard by the famous Jack Hylton, who signed the 19-year-old Fuld to a three-year contract with his celebrated band, which resulted in engagements in every important theatre in the British Isles and the Continent. In 1936 he was signed by Clifford C. Fischer for the French Casino in New York and later the Paramount Theatre on Broadway. As an International favorite, Fuld started to adapt Yiddish and Hebrew songs for inclusion in his repertoire. At the French Casino his biggest song was Rosinkes Mit Mandeln, and the great Al Jolson came back every night at \\"five to ten\\" just to catch his performance. World war II In 1938 his temporary visa ran out and he had to return to Europe where he applied for an immigration visa. He caught the last boat back before the Nazis invaded the Lowlands and immediately offered his services to the Dutch government-in-exile. Together with the late Hendrik Willem van Loon, Fuld started the shortwave broadcasts to the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies. Rumors reached the UK of what was happening to the Jewish population of the Netherlands and that almost the complete Fuld family had been murdered by the Nazis. As a result, during this period he no longer could face an audience and stopped singing completely. As he always had a talent for writing, he soon became one of the most sought after material writers on Broadway, writing for such comedians as Milton Berle, the Ritz Brothers, Jackie Miles, Jackie Gleason, Jan Murray, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, followed by the \\"Kraft Music Hall\\" program. He also produced, directed and wrote a comedy show called Fun For Your Money with which he toured the USA. Post-war career In 1948 he returned to the Netherlands as an American citizen to search for news about his family. Upon his arrival, in gratitude for his wartime broadcasts, thousands of people greeted him and he was offered a contract to sing at the largest theatre in Amsterdam. Not having sung for over five years he was petrified with fear, but was such a success that he was held over for six weeks. Having regained his confidence, he accepted an engagement at the London Casino where he was a tremendous hit. Offers followed from all over the world, and while at the Sa Majeste in Paris with his revue, he visited a little Yiddish night club where he heard a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto sing a song which touched him deeply - \\"Vi ahin zol Ikh geyn?\\". Fuld was so impressed that he asked the composer for a copy and said \\"I'll make this a world hit!\\". He kept his promise; upon returning to England he wrote English lyrics and recorded it for Decca under the title \\"Where can I Go?\\". It was also released in America, and as the saying goes, it took him twenty years to become a star overnight. He sang it on television in the Milton Berle show, the Perry Como Show and in the Frank Sinatra Show, and it was also recorded by some of America's biggest record stars such as Ray Charles and Steve Lawrence. Among his greatest fans were such stars as Billie Holiday, Al Jolson and Édith Piaf. Since 1949, Leo Fuld made five world tours and appeared in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, North Africa, Egypt, Israel and Lebanon. He shared the stage for 10 weeks with Edith Piaf at the Paris ABC Theatre and was engaged by the Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia to sing at the wedding of his daughter at the Imperial Palace in Addis Ababa. In 1956 he sets up his own nightclub in New York 'Sabrah' in New York, which was very successful, before relocating to Las Vegas. There he married to Ilone Mendels, having one daughter Mirjam Fuld-Lelah. After divorce Fuld returned to the Netherlands. With producer Mohamed el-Fers and arranger Kees Post he recorded his last CD, The Legend for the Ghana-based company Hippo Records. On the CD Fuld sings his best known-songs, but they are provided with striking Oriental arrangements. At 84 Leo Fuld died in his place of residence in Amsterdam. The remainder of Leo's family lives in the Netherlands while his two favorite nephews (Avi and Peled) live in Israel.

It is the only high school in the Streetsboro City School District and had an enrollment of 577 students in the 2015–16 school year. The school was first established in 1902, but closed in 1950; it was re-established in 1962. The current facility was completed in December 2016 and opened for classes in January 2017. Athletic teams are known as the Rockets and school colors are blue and gold. Streetsboro High School is the home of high school radio station WSTB, branded \\"88.9 The Alternation\\". History Streetsboro High School was established in 1902 when the Streetsboro Township schools consolidated to a central building from one-room schoolhouses. The Streetsboro Township School would house the high school and all grades in Streetsboro until 1950, when it was replaced by a new school, later called Wise Elementary School. Wise was adjacent to the original building and was planned to house all 12 grade levels. At that time, however, the Ohio Department of Education revoked the high school charter, so high school students were initially sent to Aurora High School in neighboring Aurora, before eventually being sent to Davey Junior High School and Theodore Roosevelt High School in Kent. This arrangement continued until 1962, when the school was re-established at the opening of a new high school building on Annalane Drive. The class of 1964 was the first class to graduate from Streetsboro since 1950, while the class of 1965 was the first to have attended all years of schooling in Streetsboro since the class of 1950. The building on Annalane Drive had several additions, both to the building and to the adjacent campus. In the late 1960s, Campus Elementary School and Streetsboro Middle School were built on the campus, with Henry Defer Intermediate School opening in 2004. The most recent additions to the building included a new science wing in the early 2000s, followed by eight modular classrooms later that decade. See \\"Aerials\\" tab for different years A fire in June 2010 caused approximately $2 million in water, smoke, and structural damage, mainly to the gymnasium. The fire forced the district to shut down the school for the remainder of the school year. Because repairs to the gymnasium were not completed until early March 2011, the boys basketball team played home games that season at the old Ravenna High School in nearby Ravenna, which had recently been vacated. The current building and campus is located along Ohio State Route 14, and was approved by voters in November 2013 as part of a bond issue that included additions and updates to other district buildings. The building was completed in December 2016, with an open house and dedication on December 17. The first classes were held at the facility January 3, 2017. The building is sustainably designed with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certification. Included in the new building is an 800-seat auditorium, 800-seat gymnasium, outdoor courtyard, radio studio, and a TV studio, along with athletic fields and new stadium complex. The former high school building on Annalane Drive was partially demolished, renovated, and reconfigured to house students in grades 6–8. It reopened as Streetsboro Middle School in 2018.

It was broadcast live on weekday mornings at 5 a.m. Eastern Time Zone, and competed with CNN's Early Start and Fox News's Fox & Friends First. The program was last anchored by Yasmin Vossoughian. Format Morning Joe First Look consisted of many of the same segments and is produced by the same staff as NBC's early morning news program Early Today; some segments, such as a local weather cut-in and some feature stories, are either excluded or changed for the MSNBC broadcast, along with the anchor background (an early morning skycam shot of Manhattan on First Look, and sunrise scenes for Early Today) and graphical styling. There was a segment that is exclusive to the MSNBC newscast, a segment aired before the entertainment news summary at the end of the program, featuring excerpts from the monologue of the previous night/weeknight's episode of either The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon or Late Night with Seth Meyers, followed by the guest list of the upcoming episode. A replay of First Look aired at 5:30 a.m. ET before July 27, 2009, when Way Too Early with Kasie Hunt premiered. MSNBC placed the program on a short-term hiatus to test a 5 a.m. replay of both Countdown with Keith Olbermann and The Rachel Maddow Show at various times from February to April 2009; First Look was restored onto the schedule after that. Between November 2005, when CNN cancelled Daybreak and January 2011, when CNN began simulcasting CNN International's World Business Today and World One, Early Today and Way Too Early (which formerly followed the program at 5:30 a.m. ET) were the only American morning cable news programs with a pre-6 a.m. ET start time. During the 2016 Summer Olympics on August 8, 2016, the program was retitled Morning Joe First Look with the latter show's logo blended into a new logo for First Look, but retained the same format, while some Way Too Early early features were blended into what is now the second half-hour of First Look; the latter program was discontinued. On September 10, 2020, MSNBC announced Morning Joe First Look would be replaced with a revival of Way Too Early starting on September 21. On-air staff As Morning Joe First Look was broadcast from the same studio at 30 Rock in New York City as NBC's early morning news program Early Today, the same personalities are seen on both programs. Yasmin Vossoughian presently serve as the main anchor of the program. Louis Burgdorf began to serve as a co-anchor with the Morning Joe brand extension, and does most of his duties from the NBC News control room.

It is based in the hamlet of Aghyaran near Castlederg, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. The club concentrates on playing football, while a ladies' football club of the same name also play at the same grounds. Aghyaran is the most westerly GAA club in Tyrone, surrounded by County Donegal to the north and west and County Fermanagh to the south. The distance between Aghyaran and Tyrone's most easterly GAA club, Moortown, is approximately 55 miles. Aghyaran have only one GAA All Star after Ronan McNamee won the award in the 2019 season. The senior team currently competes in Division 2 of the Tyrone All-County Football League and played in the Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship in 2019. Its manager is Mark Copland. Aghyaran won their first All-Ireland medal when Sadie McSorley won the Aithriseoirecht/Scealaíocht (Recitation/Storytelling) at the 1986 Scór Sinsear. History Aghyaran St Davog's was founded in 1956. There was a previous club in the area between 1947-8. A ladies' football club was established in 1993. Honours The club won its first title by winning the West Tyrone Junior Football League in 1962. This was followed up by winning the West Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship in 1965 and 1969, with the Tyrone Intermediate Football Championship won in 1981 and 1987. The highest league honour the club has won was the Division 1B title in 2000. Aghyaran have yet to win the Tyrone Senior Football Championship. Notable players Ciaran McGarvey played full back on team that lost to Kerry in the 1986 All- Ireland final, marking star forward Eoin Liston. Shane Sweeney was the first player from Aghyaran to win a Senior County All-Ireland medal in 2005, along with former Aghyaran player Martin Penrose. Aghyaran currently have two players on the Tyrone team, Benny Gallen, Ronan McNamee and Ronan McHugh. Ronan McNamee played fullback on the team that won the 2016 Ulster Senior Football Championship. Brendan Dolan (R.I.P) was the first Aghyaran man to represent Tyrone at senior level. Brendan made his Tyrone Championship debut in 1970, and was ever present at midfield for Tyrone and Ulster Railway Cup squads, and got to show off his high fielding skills as Tyrone toured America '69. Brendan stood at 6 ft 4 inches tall, he won MacRory and Hogan Cup medals with St Columb's Derry in 1965 and was a member of the Tyrone Junior Team that won an All Ireland in 1968. Sadly his life was cut short after a tragic car accident that took his life, whilst he was driving to school in Strabane where he worked as a PE teacher, in January 1973.

His work in the prediction of complex systems such as the weather, genetics and the economy has been featured in New Scientist, the Financial Times, Adbusters, BBC Radio, Russia-1, and CBC TV. He now conducts research and writes in the areas of systems biology and economics, and runs a mathematical consultancy Systems Forecasting.

Economyths: Ten Ways Economics Gets It Wrong was a finalist for the 2011 National Business Book Award. Criticism of use of mathematical models A consistent topic in Orrell’s work is the limitations of mathematical models, and the need to acknowledge these limitations if we are to understand the causes of forecast error. He argues for example that errors in weather prediction are caused primarily by model error, rather than the butterfly effect. Economic models are seen as particularly unrealistic. In Truth or Beauty: Science and the Quest for Order, he suggests that many such theories, along with areas of physics such as string theory, are motivated largely by the desire to conform with a traditional scientific aesthetic, that is currently being subverted by developments in complexity science. Quantum theory of money and value In The Evolution of Money (coauthored with journalist Roman Chlupatý) and two articles Orrell proposed a quantum theory of money and value, which states that money has dualistic properties because it combines the properties of an owned and valued thing, with those of abstract number. The fact that these two sides of money are incompatible leads to its complex and often unpredictable behavior. In Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money he argues that these dualistic properties feed up to affect the economy as a whole.  Books  * * Revised and extended edition of 2010 book.

The main change was a modified fuselage with a tandem open cockpit (the Cygnet had an enclosed cockpit with side-by-side seating). The same outboard wing panels were used, but due to the slimmer fuselage, the resulting wingspan was reduced by 24 inches (61 cm), and wing area was reduced. The Owlet prototype (registered G-AGBK) first flew on 5 September 1940. It did not attract any orders, but ironically it was impressed into service (with serial number DP240) with the Royal Air Force as a tricycle undercarriage trainer for the Douglas Boston, which was the primary use to which unmodified Cygnets were also being put.

The \\"cargo\\" is associated with the peptides either through chemical linkage via covalent bonds or through non-covalent interactions. CPPs deliver the cargo into cells, commonly through endocytosis, for use in research and medicine. Current use is limited by a lack of cell specificity in CPP-mediated cargo delivery and insufficient understanding of the modes of their uptake. Other delivery mechanisms that have been developed include CellSqueeze and electroporation. CPPs typically have an amino acid composition that either contains a high relative abundance of positively charged amino acids such as lysine or arginine or has sequences that contain an alternating pattern of polar, charged amino acids and non- polar, hydrophobic amino acids. These two types of structures are referred to as polycationic or amphipathic, respectively. A third class of CPPs are the hydrophobic peptides, containing only apolar residues with low net charge or hydrophobic amino acid groups that are crucial for cellular uptake. Transactivating transcriptional activator (TAT), from human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), was the first CPP discovered. In 1988, two laboratories independently found that TAT could be efficiently taken up from the surrounding media by numerous cell types in culture. Since then, the number of known CPPs has expanded considerably, and small molecule synthetic analogues with more effective protein transduction properties have been generated. A recent discovery found that Papillomaviridae, such as the human papillomavirus, use CPPs to penetrate the intracellular membrane to trigger retrograde trafficking of the viral unit to the nucleus. Mechanisms of membrane translocation Cell-penetrating peptides are of different sizes, amino acid sequences, and charges but all CPPs have one distinct characteristic, which is the ability to translocate the plasma membrane and facilitate the delivery of various molecular cargoes to the cytoplasm or an organelle. There has been no real consensus as to the mechanism of CPP translocation, but the theories of CPP translocation can be classified into three main entry mechanisms: direct penetration in the membrane, endocytosis- mediated entry, and translocation through the formation of a transitory structure. CPP transduction is an area of ongoing research. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are able to transport different types of cargo molecules across plasma membrane; thus, they act as molecular delivery vehicles. They have numerous applications in medicine as drug delivery agents in the treatment of different diseases including cancer and virus inhibitors, as well as contrast agents for cell labeling. Examples of the latter include acting as a carrier for GFP, MRI contrast agents, or quantum dots. =Direct penetration= 400px The majority of early research suggested that the translocation of polycationic CPPs across biological membranes occurred via an energy- independent cellular process. It was believed that translocation could progress at 4 °C and most likely involved a direct electrostatic interaction with negatively charged phospholipids. Researchers proposed several models in attempts to elucidate the biophysical mechanism of this energy-independent process. Although CPPs promote direct effects on the biophysical properties of pure membrane systems, the identification of fixation artifacts when using fluorescent labeled probe CPPs caused a reevaluation of CPP-import mechanisms. These studies promoted endocytosis as the translocation pathway. An example of direct penetration has been proposed for TAT. The first step in this proposed model is an interaction with the unfolded fusion protein (TAT) and the membrane through electrostatic interactions, which disrupt the membrane enough to allow the fusion protein to cross the membrane. After internalization, the fusion protein refolds due to the chaperone system. This mechanism was not agreed upon, and other mechanisms involving clathrin-dependent endocytosis have been suggested. Many more detailed methods of CPP uptake have been proposed including transient pore formation. This mechanism involves strong interactions between cell-penetrating peptides and the phosphate groups on both sides of the lipid bilayer, the insertion of positively charged arginine side-chains that nucleate the formation of a transient pore, followed by the translocation of cell-penetrating peptides by diffusing on the pore surface. This mechanism explains how key ingredients, such as the cooperation among the peptides, the large positive charge, and specifically the guanidinium groups, contribute to the uptake. The proposed mechanism also illustrates the importance of membrane fluctuations. Indeed, mechanisms that involve large fluctuations of the membrane structure, such as transient pores and the insertion of charged amino acid side-chains, may be common and perhaps central to the functions of many membrane protein functions. =Endocytosis-mediated translocation= 400px Endocytosis is the second mechanism liable for cellular internalization. Endocytosis is the process of cellular ingestion by which the plasma membrane folds inward to bring substances into the cell. During this process cells absorb material from the outside of the cell by imbibing it with their cell membrane. The classification of cellular localization using fluorescence or by endocytosis inhibitors is the basis of most examination. However, the procedure used during preparation of these samples creates questionable information regarding endocytosis. Moreover, studies show that cellular entry of penetratin by endocytosis is an energy-dependent process. This process is initiated by polyarginines interacting with heparan sulphates that promote endocytosis. Research has shown that TAT is internalized through a form of endocytosis called macropinocytosis. Studies have illustrated that endocytosis is involved in the internalization of CPPs, but it has been suggested that different mechanisms could transpire at the same time. This is established by the behavior reported for penetratin and transportan wherein both membrane translocation and endocytosis occur concurrently. =Translocation through the formation of a transitory structure= 400px The third mechanism responsible for the translocation is based on the formation of the inverted micelles. Inverted micelles are aggregates of colloidal surfactants in which the polar groups are concentrated in the interior and the lipophilic groups extend outward into the solvent. According to this model, a penetratin dimer combines with the negatively charged phospholipids, thus generating the formation of an inverted micelle inside of the lipid bilayer. The structure of the inverted micelles permits the peptide to remain in a hydrophilic environment. Nonetheless, this mechanism is still a matter of discussion, because the distribution of the penetratin between the inner and outer membrane is non-symmetric. This non-symmetric distribution produces an electrical field that has been well established. Increasing the amount of peptide on the outer leaflets causes the electric field to reach a critical value that can generate an electroporation-like event. The last mechanism implied that internalization occurs by peptides that belong to the family of primary amphipathic peptides, MPG and Pep-1. Two very similar models have been proposed based on physicochemical studies, consisting of circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These models are associated with electrophysiological measurements and investigations that have the ability to mimic model membranes such as monolayer at the air-water interface. The structure giving rise to the pores is the major difference between the proposed MPG and Pep-1 model. In the MPG model, the pore is formed by a b-barrel structure, whereas the Pep-1 is associated with helices. In addition, strong hydrophobic phospholipid-peptide interactions have been discovered in both models. In the two peptide models, the folded parts of the carrier molecule correlate to the hydrophobic domain, although the rest of the molecule remains unstructured. 400px Cell-penetrating peptide facilitated translocation is a topic of great debate. Evidence has been presented that translocation could use several different pathways for uptake. In addition, the mechanism of translocation can be dependent on whether the peptide is free or attached to cargo. The quantitative uptake of free or CPP connected to cargo can differ greatly but studies have not proven whether this change is a result of translocation efficiency or the difference in translocation pathway. It is probable that the results indicate that several CPP mechanisms are in competition and that several pathways contribute to CPP internalization. Applications =CPP mediated delivery of nucleic acids= Nucleic acid-based macromolecules such as siRNA, antisense oligonucleotide, decoy DNA, and plasmid have been realized as promising biological and pharmacological therapeutics in regulation of gene expression. However, unlike other small-molecular drugs, their development and applications are limited by high molecular weight and negative charges, which results in poor uptake efficiency and low cellular traffic. To overcome these problems, several different delivery systems have been developed, including CPP-nucleic acid conjugate, which is a very powerful tool. Formation of CPP-nucleic acid complexes 400px 400px Most CPP-nucleic acid complexes that have been proposed so far are formed through covalent bonding. A range of CPP-nucleic acid complexes have been synthesized through different chemistries that are either stable or cleavable linkages. And the most widely used method in publication is cleavable disulfide linkages through total stepwise solid- phase synthesis or solution-phase or solid-phase fragment coupling. Some other strategies like stable amide, thiazolidine, oxime and hydrazine linkage have also been developed. However, those covalent linking methods are limited by the concern that the synthetic covalent bond between CPP and nucleic acid may alter the biological activity of the latter. Thus, a new non-covalent strategy requiring no chemical modification with short amphipathic CPPs, like MPG and Pep-1 as carriers has been successfully applied for delivery of cargoes. These non-covalent conjugates are formed through either electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. With this method, cargoes such as nucleic acids and proteins could be efficiently delivered while maintaining full biological activity. For siRNA delivery Short interfering RNA (siRNA) is a very powerful new tool that can interfere with and silence the expression of specific disease gene. To improve cellular uptake of siRNA, CPP strategies have been applied to facilitate the delivery of siRNA into cells through either covalent or non-covalent linkages. In one study, siRNA is covalently linked to transportan and penetratin by disulfide-linkage at 5'-end of the sense strands of siRNA to target luciferase or eGFP mRNA reporters. In another study, TAT- siRNA conjugate through a stable thiomaleimide linkage at 3'-end of siRNA was delivered into HeLa cells for eGFP gene silencing. However, non-covalent strategies appear to be better for siRNA delivery with a more significant biological response. In one study, MPG/siRNA complexes formed through stable non-covalent strategy showed successful introduction of siRNA into cultured cells and induced robust regulation of target mRNA. Furthermore, MPG/siRNA complexes have also been applied for delivery of siRNA in vivo into mouse blastocytes for gene regulation. MPG forms highly stable complexes with siRNA with a low degradation rate and can be easily functionalized for specific targeting, which are major advantages compared with the covalent CPP technology. New substrate design for siRNA delivery siRNA cell delivery represent a valuable tool for treatment of cancer disease, viral infections and genetic disorders. However, classical strategies involve covalent linking of cargo molecules and CPPs, which does not provide efficient protection of siRNA molecules in vivo; thus results reported in literature are not consistent. Recently, non-covalent strategies have been successfully reported. Secondary amphipathic peptides based on aromatic tryptophan and arginine residues linked with lysine as spacer have been reported under the name of CADY. CADY contains a short peptide sequence of 20 amino acids, with the sequence “Ac-GLWRALWRLLRSLWRLLWRA-cysteamide.\\" This peptide is able to self-assemble in a helical shape with hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues on different side of the molecule, it has two different orientations of the surface that represent the lowest energy and it is able to form complexes with siRNA at different molar ratio varying from 1:1 to 80:1. CADY is able to form a shield around siRNA molecule protecting it from biodegradative processes that may occur before cellular penetration occurs. These types of substrates may present important applications in vivo. For antisense oligomer delivery Antisense oligonucleotides (asONs) have been used in basic research and are being developed as possible medical treatments. CPP strategies have been developed to deliver antisense oligomers such as PNA and PMO into cells. Overcoming the repulsion by the cell membrane of negative- charged ONs and the degradation of asONs by enzymes, CPPs increase asONs bioavailability. Two types of neutral ON analogues, peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO or Morpholino) are becoming dominant in this area. PNA has been conjugated with various CPPs either through disulfide linkages or through stable amide bonds. For example, antisense activity within cells that blocked expression of the galanin receptor was observed when a 21-mer PNA was coupled to the penetratin. Results on antiviral activity with PNA targeting HIV-1 have also been reported through disulfide linkage with TAT. CPP-PMO conjugates have also been successfully used to inhibit the replication of several viruses such as SARS and influenza and attachment of CPPs has improved the efficacy of splice-modifying Morpholinos in development for treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy For decoy DNA delivery Decoy DNA is an exogenous double-strand DNA (dsDNA), which can mimic a promoter sequence that can inhibit the activity of a specific transcription factor. But dsDNA has the same problem as other therapeutics, poor bioavailability. In one study, CPPs TP and TP10 were coupled to NFкB decoy DNA, which blocked the effect of interleukin-1-induced NFкB activation and IL-6 gene expression. In another study, TP10 coupled Myc decoy DNA decreased proliferative capacity of N2a cells. For plasmid delivery Individual genes can be inserted into specific sites on plasmids, and recombinant plasmids can be introduced into living cells. A method using macro-branched TAT has been proposed for plasmid DNA delivery into various cell lines and showed significant transfection capabilities. Multimers of TAT have been found to increase transfection efficiency of plasmid DNA by 6-8 times more than poly-L-arginine or mutant TAT2-M1, and by 390 times compared with the standard vectors. =CPP mediated delivery of proteins= The development of therapeutic proteins that has presented a valuable method to treat diseases is limited by low efficiency of traditional delivery methods. The evaluation of cytosolic delivery of CPP linked proteins has been found to be prone to artifacts and therefore requires the use of evaluation methods that distinguish true cytosolic delivery from cell surface attached or endosomally entrapped CPP-proteins. Recently, several methods using CPPS as vehicles to deliver biologically active, full-length proteins into living cells and animals have been reported. Several groups have successfully delivered CPP fused proteins in vitro. TAT was able to deliver different proteins, such as horseradish peroxidase and RNase A across cell membrane into the cytoplasm in different cell lines in vitro. The size range of proteins with effective delivery is from 30kDa to 120-150kDa. In one study, TAT-fused proteins are rapidly internalized by lipid raft−dependent macropinocytosis using a transducible TAT−Cre recombinase reporter assay on live cells. In another study, a TAT-fused protein was delivered into mitochondria of breast cancer cells and decreased the survival of breast cancer cells, which showed capability of TAT-fusion proteins to modulate mitochondrial function and cell survival. Moreover, cR10, a cyclic poly-arginine CPP, enabled the endocytose independent transduction of antigen binding proteins through the cellular membrane with immediate bioavailability. Thereby, the authors of the study were able to deliver fluorescent antigen binding proteins into cells facilitating live-cell immunostaining. However, very few in vivo studies have succeeded. In one study, in vivo delivery of TAT- or penetratin-crosslinked Fab fragments yielded varied organ distributions and an overall increase in organ retention, which showed tissue localization. A non-covalent method that forms CPP/protein complexes has also been developed to address the limitations in covalent methods, such as chemical modification before crosslinking, and denaturation of proteins before delivery. In one study, a short amphipathic peptide carrier, Pep-1, and protein complexes have proven effective for delivery. It was shown that Pep-1 could facilitate rapid cellular uptake of various peptides, proteins, and even full-length antibodies with high efficiency and less toxicity. This approach has greatly simplified the formulation of reagents. =As contrast agents transporters = 400px 400px CPPs found applications as transporters of contrast agents across plasma membranes. These contrast agents are able to label the tumor cells, making the compounds important tools in cancer diagnosis; they are also used in in vivo and in vitro cellular experiments. The most important classes of CPP are isolated from viruses, such as TAT (transactivated-transcription) derived from HIV-1, penetratin, and transportan. The most widely used CPPs are based on TAT derivatives. TAT is an arginine-rich CPP. Several improvements for this substrate includes the usage of unnatural β or γ amino acids. This strategy offers multiple advantages, such resistance to proteolytic degradation, a natural degradation process by which peptide bonds are hydrolyzed to amino acids. Unnatural acid insertion in the peptide chain has multiple advantages. It facilitates the formation of stable foldamers with distinct secondary structure. β-Peptides are conformationally more stable in aqueous solution than naturally occurring peptides, especially for small chains. The secondary structure is reinforced by the presence of a rigid β-amino acid, which contains cyclohexane or cyclopentane fragments. These fragments generate a more rigid structure and influence the opening angle of the foldamer. These features are very important for new peptide design. Helical β-peptides mimic antimicrobial activities of host defense peptides. This feature requires the orientation of cationic –hydrophilic on one side, and hydrophobic residues on the other side of the helix. The attachment of fluorescent group on one head of the molecule confers contrast properties. A new strategy to enhance the cellular up-take capacity of CPP is based on association of polycationic and polyanionic domains that are separated by a linker. Cellular association of polycationic residues (polyarginine) with negatively charged membrane cells is effectively blocked by the presence of polyanionic residue (poly-glutamic acid) and the linker, which confer the proper distance between these two charged residues in order to maximize their interaction. These peptides adopt hairpin structure, confirmed by overhauser effect correlation for proton- proton proximities of the two charged moieties. At this stage only the linker is exposed to protease hydrolysis in vivo applications. The linker hydrolysis occur and the two charged fragments experience more conformational freedom. In the absence of linker, the cationic peptide can interact more efficient with the target cell and cellular uptake occurs before proteolysis. This strategy found applications in labeling tumor cells in vivo. Tumor cells were marked in minutes. Linker degradation can be predicted by the amount of D-aminoacids (the unnatural isomer) incorporated in the peptide chain, this restricts in vivo proteolysis to the central linker. Contrast agents as cargo molecules =Quantum dots= 400px Quantum dots (QD) represent a relative new class of fluorescent probes that have superior optical properties than classical organic dyes based on fluorescent groups. The main advantages of QD include high quantum yields, broad absorption spectra, size-tunable emission spectra, and good resistance to chemical and photochemical degradation. In vivo tests have shown that several positively charged peptides (based on guanidine residues) are able to cross cell membranes and to promote cellular uptake of attached molecules including quantum dots. QD properties can be easily modified by changing the organic substrates linked to them, offering a versatile biological tool as cell markers. Research is in progress to optimize the methodologies for the intracellular delivery of QD and QD bioconjugates, and characterization of long-term in vivo photophysical properties. Quantum dots are colloidal nanocrystals, based on a cadmium- selenium (CdSe) core covered with a zinc-sulfur (ZnS) layer. This substrate has been used intensively as a cellular marker because CdSe emits in the visible domain and is an excellent contrast agent, while the ZnS layer protects the core from oxidation and also the leeching of CdSe into the surrounding solution. This strategy also improves the photo-luminescence yield. The properties can be tuned by the thickness of the ZnS protective layers. Colloidal QD emission can be modulated from UV-Vis to the infrared by using different types of coating agents, such as ZnS, CdS, ZnSe, CdTe and PbSe. The properties of quantum dots can be also tuned by the synthetic scheme, high temperature solvent/ligand mixtures that influence the nanocrystal properties. High-quality QD contrast agents are obtained at elevated temperatures; however, because they have lower water solubility, their usage as cell markers is limited. Further functionalization with hydrophilic ligands is required. The advantages of QD are represented by their fast action; they are able to label a target tissue or cell in seconds. In vivo studies show that QD are able to selectively label cancer cells, and they accumulate at tumor sites. Tumor cells labeled with QD can be tracked with multiphoton microscopy as they invade lung tissue. In both studies, spectral imaging and autofluorescent subtraction allowed multicolour in vivo visualization of cells and tissues. A major drawback of QD is their relatively high toxicity. Functionalizations with different substrates that increase bioaffinity and decrease toxicity are in progress. For instance, sulfur from the QD shell is able to form reversible disulfide bonds with a wide class of organic compounds. Magnetic resonance imaging 400px Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for disease diagnosis such as cancer metastasis and inflammation, using different metal chelates. Metal chelates increase the contrast signal between normal and diseased tissues by catalyzing the relaxation of water protons in their proximities. Typical examples are Gd3+ low-molecular-weight chelates, and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). In vivo administration of these agents allows the labeling of tumor cells; or cells can be labeled in vitro with contrast agents and then they can be injected and monitored in vivo by using MRI techniques. SPIO nanoparticles confer high sensitivity in MRI but they have lower affinity for cells; they work at high concentrations. Functionalizations of these compounds using dendrimeric guanidines showed similar activities as TAT-based CPPs but higher toxicity. New substrates based on dendrons with hydroxyl or amine peripheries show low toxicity. Applications of SPIO includes cell labeling in vivo; due to low toxicity, they are clinically approved for use in liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal imaging. The presence of octamer arginine residues allows cell membrane transduction of various cargo molecules including peptides, DNA, siRNA, and contrast agents. However, the ability of cross membrane is not unidirectional; arginine-based CPPs are able to enter-exit the cell membrane, displaying an overall decreasing concentration of contrast agent and a decrease of magnetic resonance (MR) signal in time. This limits their application in vivo. To solve this problem, contrast agents with disulfide, reversible bond between metal chelate and transduction moiety enhance the cell-associated retention. The disulfide bond is reduced by the target cell environment and the metal chelate remains trapped in the cytoplasm, increasing the retention time of chelate in the target cell.

Unlike the other coins in this series, the crown did not bear the month of issue. Shilling, with a portrait of James II dated April 1690. Gun money was an issue of coins made by the forces of James II during the Williamite War in Ireland between 1689 and 1691. They were minted in base metal (copper, brass or pewter), and were designed to be redeemed for silver coins following a victory by James II and consequently bore the date in months to allow a gradual replacement. As James lost the war, that replacement never took place, although the coins were allowed to circulate at much reduced values before the copper coinage was resumed. They were mostly withdrawn from circulation in the early 18th century. The name \\"gun money\\" stems from the idea that they were minted from melted down guns. However, many other brass objects, such as church bells, were also used. There were two issues. The first \\"large\\" issue consisted of sixpences, shillings and half crowns (2½ shillings). The second, \\"small\\" issue consisted of shillings, halfcrowns and crowns (5 shillings). Some of the second issue were overstruck on large issue pieces, with shillings struck over sixpences, half crowns on shillings and crowns on half crowns. The most notable feature of the coins is the date, because the month of striking was also included. This was so that after the war (in the event of James' victory), soldiers would be able to claim interest on their wages, which had been withheld from proper payment for so long. Specimen strikings were produced in silver and gold for most months, and these tend to be extremely rare. Pewter money Pewter money is a rarer type of gun money, manufactured out of Pewter, an alloy containing mostly tin, and smaller amounts of copper, antimony, bismuth and lead. Some of the coins had also a brass plug. Halfcrowns and Crowns were issued in 1690 with the same dies as other gun money coins. Both these coins are extremely rare, along with a Groat struck in 1689 which is probably a pattern. Halfpennies and Pennies were also produced in 1689 and 1690, and less rare, although the 1689 penny is virtually unknown.British Museum, and Herbert A. Grueber.

History and background In principle there is a mathematical basis for the Alberta Township System (ATS) variant of the Dominion Land Survey (DLS) system as implemented in Canada. The implementation in western Canada reflects a number of slightly different approaches, as well as a large number of errors. Long before the Dominion Land Surveyor (DLS) first came into official existence in 1872, licensed surveyors known as provincial land surveyors had been functioning in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec (then called Canada West and Canada East) under an Act of 1849. Establishing a system of examination for new aspirants to the title of \\"Dominion Land Surveyor\\" was officially adopted in 1874. In 1910 The Alberta Surveyors Act prescribed the system and the methods whereby land surveys were to be carried out under the general purview of a provincial director of surveys whose responsibility it was to see that all survey work was performed in accordance with the provisions of that Act. The system is also used by provincial governments when selling exploration rights, and oil and gas wells are referenced by their location as defined within the Alberta Township System. How it works Townships in relation with meridians, baselines and correction lines Below is a brief description of how to lay out the DLS grid for Alberta. Lay off ticks from the 49th parallel of latitude to the 60th parallel. This gives 127 township lines. The 49th parallel of latitude is the first base line of the ATS system. On it lay off ticks westwards starting at the 110th line of longitude (4th DLS meridian). Start over at the 114th and 118th lines of longitude (5th and 6th DLS meridians). Extend these ticks due north (following a line of constant longitude) to the first correction line. This gets you your first set of range lines. Starting at the 49th parallel (first base line) go directly north. This gets you to the second base line. At the latitude corresponding to this distance from the 49th parallel lay off 6-mile-6-chain ticks westwards from 110th meridian as you did at the 1st base line. The circumference of the earth has decreased as you went northwards, so there will be fewer full ticks than there were one base line south. Extend 12 miles 6 chains north and 12 miles 6 chains south from these ticks. This gets you your next set of range lines. You will note there is an offset between the range lines extending north from the lower base line and those extending south from the current ones. This offset occurs along what is called a correction line. Repeat the base line process every 24 miles 12 chains northwards (to the 32nd). All this will result in a mesh of cells nominally six miles (plus 3 or 6 chains for road allowances) on a side. Each such cell is called a township (not to be confused with the township lines laid off earlier). Subdivide the township into 36 sections by laying off ticks of one-sixth of each township side and connecting them by north-south and east-west lines. The sections are numbered boustrophedonically starting from the southeast corner of the township. Sections can be similarly subdivided into quarters by placing and connecting ticks at the halfway point on each section side. Use the same process to subdivide sections into legal subdivisions (LSD) except place the tick at the one-quarter waypoints. LSDs are numbered boustrophedonically starting at the southeast corner of the section. While the ATS format is proprietary, online conversion tools have been developed. *Alberta Geological Survey converts the system to geographical coordinates See also *Dominion Land Survey *List of settlements in Alberta External links * Map Service from AgCanada: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba: quarter-sections, sections, and townships.

It is the only high school in the Windham Exempted Village School District. Their nickname is the Bombers. Windham High School was founded in 1883. Athletics Windham High School offers several athletic teams, all of which are known as the Bombers. The school currently competes in the Northeastern Athletic Conference Stars Division and began play in the NAC in 2013. Currently, Windham sponsors seven athletic teams: Fall sports * Football * Cheerleading * Golf * Girls' volleyball Winter sports * Boys' basketball * Girls' basketball * Cheerleading Spring Sports * Baseball * Softball * Track Former sports *Cross Country *Wrestling *Bowling *Six-man football =History= The Bombers have at least one league championship in every sport in which they participate. During the late 1950s, the school played a leading role in establishing the short-lived Tomahawk Conference and was a longtime member of the former Portage County League and Portage Trail Conference. In 1939, the school was ranked by The American Boy magazine as the 16th best in the nation for six-man football. This selection was made by Stephen Epler, the creator of what was then a fairly new sport. The Bombers defeated Stamford Collegiate Secondary School in Niagara Falls, Ontario for the first-ever international title on October 5, 1940, and were ranked in the top 10 in the nation by The American Boy magazine. Three members of the team, Harold and Fred Stanley and Robert Turner, were chosen as All-American players, the only Windham players ever so honored. Tomahawk Conference According to the Ravenna-Kent Record-Courier, Windham competed in the Portage County League until 1953, when the Windham school district became the Windham Exempted Village School District. In Ohio, Exempted Village School Districts are given similar authority to city school districts; i.e. to \\"determine for itself the number of members and the organization of the district board of education\\". At this time, Windham withdrew from the PCL and competed as an independent. Prior to 1953, most schools in Portage County were given \\"A\\" classification in Ohio's system of measuring school size for athletics. Due to increasing enrollment from the construction of the Ravenna Arsenal a decade earlier, Windham was close to \\"AA\\" classification. In 1957, Windham had an exceptional year in football, posting an undefeated record of six wins and a tie. In order to maintain \\"A\\" classification, Windham cut freshmen from the team at the beginning of the season. However, in contests against Garrettsville and Ravenna Township, football coach Leo Kot played two freshmen to prevent running up the score. These contests led directly to Windham's classification as \\"AA\\" upon appeal from Mogadore High School, and the subsequent formation of the Tomahawk Conference. The Bombers won the Tomahawk Conference championship for football all three years of the conference's existence, sharing the title with Southeast in 1959. Windham also won all three conference titles in baseball, and in 1961 the Bombers were state runners-up, losing the state baseball championship to Liberty Union High School. Later athletics leagues In 1961, the Bombers returned to the reconstituted Portage County League. Windham continued to enjoy success in football, and numerous other sports. The PCL became the basis of the extant Portage Trail Conference, created through inter-county expansion in 2005. On July 2, 2011, Windham announced that it would be leaving the PTC following the 2012–13 school year and joining the Northeastern Athletic Conference, citing declining enrollment and a resulting decreasing ability to compete in the PTC. In its first three years of competition, Windham won several league championships in volleyball and girls basketball.  Stan Parrish  Windham served as the first head coaching job for later college and professional football coach Stan Parrish. Parrish coached the Bombers from 1972 until 1974 after serving as an assistant from 1969–71.Stan Parrish profile at ballstatesports.com.

The family has been active around the world through their online school program, as well as their films and TV programs such as Rede Globo, National Geographic among others. In 1984 Vilfredo, Heloisa and their children left their home, work and school and set off from Florianópolis, the capital city of the State of Santa Catarina, in southern Brazil, to pursue their dream: circumnavigate the world on a sailboat. Their children, Pierre, David and Wilhelm, were 15, 10 and 7 years old, respectively. On this first adventure, the Schürmann Family spent 10 years at sea. In 1997 the Schürmann Family began their second great adventure Magellan Global Adventure. The goal was to retrace the route sailed by Ferdinand Magellan’s fleet, the first complete circumnavigation of the planet's history. For this adventure, apart from the Vilfredo and Heloisa only their son David Schürmann and Kat, their 5-year-old daughter went along. Magellan Global Adventure was followed by more than 1,5 million people, from 44 countries. Every month the adventure’s filmed reports, were broadcast internationally, with an average of 40 million television viewers in Brazil and many more around the world. After 30 months, the Schürmanns' yacht returned to Brazil. In 2011, the Schürmanns led the expedition that for the first time in Brazilian history a World War II German U-boat was located in its waters. After 9 years research and 2 years of seagoing searches the German submarine U-513 was located 85km east of their hometown of Florianópolis. The find was announced worldwide on June 17th 2011, when the Schürmanns produced images of a Side-scanning sonar. In Vilfredo’s words, “the bond that keeps our family so united is that we were, are and will be dreamers. Forever.” On September 21, 2014, the Schurmann Family set off on their new sustainable sailboat to sail around the world for the third circumnavigation: The Orient Expedition followed the routes of the Chinese that, according to controversial theories, were the first sailors to travel around the globe, before Ferdinand Magellan. The new project brought aboard innovation, technology and sustainability. The children Pierre and David (land crew leader) participated in some sections of the adventure whereas Wilhelm (Skipper) was on board throughout the expedition. The youngest, Kat will be symbolically present by inspiring the name of the new sailboat. And, for the first time, the crew gets a representative of the third generation: Emmanuel, he will accompany his grandparents throughout the voyage. The Orient Expedition also involves important actions, such as an educational project in partnership with Estácio and the production of National Geographic and a feature documentary. Based on samples collected during the trip, the Biological Oceanography Department of a renowned university (USP) have conducted a study with quality analyses of waters and planktons where the boat sailed In 2019 the Schurmann family launched the VOICE OF THE OCEAN initiative, with the goal of bringing awareness, solutions and education to the worlds Oceans challenges. The initiative includes a two-year sailing expedition, TV series, experiences, Open Innovation start-up search and a data gathering project for Scientific use around the world.

It was originally titled \\"The Scythe of Time\\". The paired stories parody the Gothic sensation tale, popular in England and America since the early 19th century. Plot summary The bizarre story follows a female narrator, Signora Psyche Zenobia. While walking through \\"the goodly city of Edina\\" with her poodle and her black servant, Pompey, she is drawn to a large Gothic cathedral. At the steeple, Zenobia sees a small opening she wishes to look through. Standing on Pompey's shoulders, she pushes her head through the opening, realizing she is in the face of a giant clock. As she gazes out at the city beyond, she soon finds that the sharp minute hand has begun to dig into her neck. Slowly, the minute hand decapitates her. At one point, pressure against her neck causes her eye to fall and roll down into the gutter and then to the street below. Her other eye follows thereafter. Finally, the clock has fully severed her head from her body. She does not express despair and is, in fact, glad to be rid of it. For a moment, she wonders which is the real Zenobia: her headless body or her severed head. The head then gives a heroic speech which Zenobia's body cannot hear because it has no ears. Her narration continues without her head, as she is now able to step down from her predicament. In fear Pompey runs off, and Zenobia sees that a rat has eaten her poodle. \\"How to Write a Blackwood Article\\" Blackwood's Magazine The companion piece, \\"How to Write a Blackwood Article\\", is a satirical \\"how-to\\" fiction on formulaic horror stories typically printed in the Scottish Blackwood's Magazine. The term \\"article\\", in Poe's time, also commonly referred to short stories rather than just non- fiction. In this mock essay, Poe stresses the need for elevating sensations in writing. The sensations should build up, it says, until the final moment, usually involving a brush with death. Zenobia herself is the narrator and main character of this story in the city of Edina. She is told by her editor to kill herself and record the sensations. Poe may have intended this as a jab at women writers.Trieber, J. Marshall. \\"The Scornful Grin: A Study of Poesque Humor\\", from Poe Studies, vol. IV, no. 2, December 1971, p. 32. It is unclear how much of this story is meant to be sarcastic. The humor, however, is based on schadenfreude.Trieber, J. Marshall. \\"The Scornful Grin: A Study of Poesque Humor\\", from Poe Studies, vol. IV, no. 2, December 1971, p. 34. Publication history Originally pairing them together as \\"The Psyche Zenobia\\" and \\"The Scythe of Time\\", Poe first published these pieces in the American Museum based in Baltimore, Maryland in November 1838.Sova, Dawn B.

History Yen's Ting Hsien (Ding Xian) Experiment in Dingzhou, HebeiCharles Hayford, To the People: James Yen and Village China (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990). and Liang's school at Zouping, Shandong,Guy Alitto, The Last Confucian: Liang Shu-Ming and the Chinese Dilemma of Modernity (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1979). were only the earliest and most prominent of hundreds of village projects, educational foundations, and government zones which aimed to change the Chinese countryside. After 1931 the Nanking government offered qualified support but also placed restrictions on the expansion of the work. American Christian missionaries gave their enthusiastic support.James Claude Thomson, Jr., While China Faced West: American Reformers in Nationalist China, 1928-1937 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1969), esp. \\"Rural Reconstruction: The American Effort,\\" pp. 203-220. The Movement was prominent in building Chinese resistance to Japanese invasions by strengthening the village economy, culture, and political structure, including pioneering work in village health.C. C. Chen, Medicine in Rural China : A Personal Account (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1989). After the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Rural Reconstruction activists formed the Rural Reconstruction Party, at first an important part of the China Democratic League, but then were rendered politically irrelevant in the emerging war between the Chinese Communists and the Guomindang. In 1948, however, James Yen persuaded the American Congress to fund the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. Before moving to Taiwan, the JCRR carried out the largest land reform project carried out in mainland China before 1949, as well as health and education projects.Hayford, To the People, pp. 209-221. On Taiwan in the 1950s, the JCRR was key in laying the rural foundation for the quick economic growth of the 1960s and 1970s.Joseph A. Yager. Transforming Agriculture in Taiwan : The Experience of the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction. (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988). ). The rural reconstruction movement started by Dr. Yen continues to be active in Asia, Africa and Latin America.

(born 30 November 1966) is an English novelist and screenwriter. Early life and education Nicholls is the middle of three siblings. He attended Barton Peveril sixth-form college at Eastleigh, Hampshire, from 1983 to 1985 (taking A-levels in Drama and Theatre Studies along with English, Physics and Biology), and playing a wide range of roles in college drama productions. Colin Firth was at the same College and they later collaborated in And When Did You Last See Your Father? He went to Bristol University in the 1980s (graduating with a BA in Drama and English in 1988) before training as an actor at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York. First career Throughout his 20s, he worked as an actor, using the stage name David Holdaway. He played small roles at various theatres, including the West Yorkshire Playhouse and, for a three-year period, at the Royal National Theatre. He struggled as an actor and has said \\"I’d committed myself to a profession for which I lacked not just talent and charisma, but the most basic of skills. Moving, standing still – things like that.\\" Nicholls says that a turning point in his career came when a friend gave him a copy of PJ Kavanagh’s memoir The Perfect Stranger, which tells the author's own tale of maturation, finding love, and discovering his path in life. Writing career =Novels= *Starter for Ten (2003) *The Understudy (2005) *One Day (2009) *Us (2014) *Sweet Sorrow (2019) =Screenwriting= Nicholls co-wrote the adapted screenplay of Simpatico and contributed four scripts to the third series of Cold Feet (both 2000). For the latter, he was nominated for a British Academy Television Craft Award for Best New Writer (Fiction). He created the Granada Television pilot and miniseries I Saw You (2000, 2002) and the Tiger Aspect six-part series Rescue Me (2002). Rescue Me lasted for only one series before being cancelled. Nicholls had written four episodes for the second series before being told of the cancellation. His anger over this led to him taking a break from screenwriting to concentrate on writing Starter for Ten. When he returned to screenwriting, he adapted Much Ado About Nothing into a one-hour segment of the BBC's 2005 ShakespeaRe-Told season. He wrote a screen adaptation of his novel, One Day, which was made into a film starring Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess. In 2006, his film adaptation Starter for 10 was released in cinemas. The following year, he wrote And When Did You Last See Your Father?, an adaptation of the memoir by Blake Morrison. His adaptation of Tess of the D'Urbervilles for the BBC aired in 2008. He has also adapted Great Expectations; the screenplay has been listed on the 2009 Brit List, an annual industry poll of the best unmade scripts outside the United States. He wrote The 7.39, which was broadcast on BBC One in January 2014. In 2015, he wrote the screenplay of Far from the Madding Crowd for BBC Films of Thomas Hardy's 1874 novel of the same name. It is the fourth film adaptation of the novel. Nicholls worked on the initial script for Bridget Jones's Baby (2016) but the script was re-written and he was not credited in the film. He wrote Patrick Melrose (2018), a five-part television series based on Edward St Aubyn's novels. =Aftersun= In 2005, he wrote Aftersun for the Old Vic's 24-Hour Play festival. The play, starring James Nesbitt, Saffron Burrows, Catherine Tate and Gael García Bernal was just 10 minutes long . Nicholls developed Aftersun into a one-off comedy for BBC One. It starred Peter Capaldi and Sarah Parish and was broadcast in 2006. Awards and honours In 2015, Nicholls was awarded an honorary DLitt from The University of Edinburgh.

In general, artificial flies are an imitation of natural food sources that fly fishers present to their target species of fish while fly fishing. Artificial flies are constructed by fly tying, in which furs, feathers, thread or any of very many other materials are tied onto a fish hook. Artificial flies may be constructed to represent all manner of potential freshwater and saltwater fish prey to include aquatic and terrestrial insects, crustaceans, worms, baitfish, vegetation, flesh, spawn, small reptiles, amphibians, mammals and birds, etc. Effective artificial fly patterns are said to be killing flies because of their ability to put fish in the creel for the fly fisher. There are thousands of artificial fly patterns, many of them with descriptive and often idiosyncratic names. Construction Fly tying is a common practice in fly fishing, considered by many anglers an important part of the fly fishing experience. Many fly fishers tie their own flies, either following patterns in books, natural insect examples, or using their own imagination. The technique involves attaching small pieces of feathers, animal fur, and other materials onto a hook in order to make it attractive to fish. This is made by wrapping thread tightly around the hook and tying on the desired materials. A fly is sized according to the width of the hook gap; large or longer flies are tied on larger, thicker, and longer hooks. The construction of tube flies is different in that the tier secures materials a tube rather than to a hook. These flies are rigged by passing the fishing line through the tube before attaching a hook. Types Generally, fly patterns are considered either \\"imitations\\" or \\"attractors\\". These can be further broken down into nymphs, terrestrials, dry flies, eggs, scuds, and streamers. Imitations seek to deceive fish through the lifelike imitation of insects on which the fish may feed. Imitations do not always have to be precisely realistic in appearance; they may derive their lifelike qualities when their fur or feathers are immersed in water and allowed to move in the current. Attractors, which are often brightly colored, seek to draw a strike by arousing an aggression response in the fish. Famous attractors are the Stimulator and Royal Wulff flies. History First known illustration of a fishing fly from 4th. edition (1652) of John Dennys's The Secrets of Angling, first published in 1613, probably the earliest poetical English treatise on Angling., The first literary reference to flies and fishing with flies was in Ælian's Natural History probably written about 200 A.D. That work discussed a Macedonian fly. The Treatyse on Fysshynge with an Angle was published (1496) within The Boke of St. Albans attributed to Dame Juliana Berners. The book contains, along with instructions on rod, line and hook making, dressings for different flies to use at different times of the year. Probably the first use of the term Artificial fly came in Izaac Walton's The Compleat Angler (1653), > Oh my good Master, this morning walk has been spent to my great pleasure and > wonder: but I pray, when shall I have your direction how to make Artificial > flyes, like to those that the Trout loves best?The Compleat Angler (1653) Frontispiece from Bowlker's Art of Angling (1854) showing a variety of artificial flies The 1652 4th edition of John Dennys's The Secrets of Angling, first published in 1613, contains the first known illustration of an artificial fly. By the early 19th century, the term artificial fly was being routinely used in angling literature much like this representative quote from Thomas Best's A Concise Treatise on the Art of Angling (1807) to refer to all types of flies used by fly fishers. > The art of artificial fly-fishing, certainly has the pre-eminence over the > other various methods that are used to take fishes in the art of angling Although the term fly was a reference to an imitation of some flying insect, by the mid-19th century the term fly was being applied to a far greater range of imitation. > The term fly is applied by sea fishermen to a certain arrangement of > feathers, wax, etc., which I am about to describe the manufacture of, and > which may be used with considerable success in mackerel, basse, and pollack > fishing. I am not disposed to think, however, that such baits are ever > mistaken by the fish which they are intended to capture for flies; but the > number used, the way in which they are mounted, viz., several on one trace, > and the method of their progress through the water, rather leads me to the > belief that they are mistaken for a number of small fry, and treated > accordingly. =Imitation= Illustration of a large Pike fly (1865) A major concept in the sport of fly fishing is that the fly imitates some form of fish prey when presented to the fish by the angler. As aquatic insects such as Mayflies, Caddisflies and Stoneflies were the primary prey being imitated during the early developmental years of fly fishing, there were always differing schools of thought on how closely a fly needed to imitate the fish's prey. In the mid to late 19th century, those schools of thought, at least for trout fishing were: the formalists (imitation matters) and the colourists (color matters most). Today, some flies are called attractor patterns because in theory, they do not resemble any specific prey, but instead attract strikes from fish. For instance, Charles Jardine, in his 2008 book \\"Flies, Ties and Techniques,\\" speaks of imitators and attractors, categorizing the Royal Wulff as an attractor and the Elk Hair Caddis as an imitator, whereas \\"... in sea trout and steelhead fishing there is a combination of imitation and attraction involved in fly construction\\".Jardine, Charles, Flies, Ties, and Techniques, Ivy Press, East Sussex, p. 6,p. 56,p.60, 2008 Paul Schullery in American Fly Fishing – A History (1996) explains however that although much has been written about the imitation theories of fly design, all successful fly patterns must imitate something to the fish, and even a perfect imitation attracts strikes from fish. The huge range of fly patterns documented today for all sorts of target species-trout, salmon, bass and panfish, pike, saltwater, tropical exotics, etc. are not easily categorized as merely imitative, attractors or something else. . Contemporary fly types and illustrative examples The categorization of artificial flies has evolved considerably in the last 200 years as writers, fly tiers and fishing equipment retailers expound and promote new ideas and techniques. Additionally, as the popularity of fly fishing expanded globally to new and exotic target species, new flies and genera of flies came into being. There are many subtypes in some of these categories especially as they apply to trout flies. As well, any given pattern of artificial fly might well fit into multiple categories depending on its intended use. The following categorization with illustrative examples is derived from the following major artificial fly merchants offerings. * Orvis – An American Fly Fishing Retailer in business since 1856 Orvis Online Fly Catalog * Farlows of London – A British Fly Fishing Retailer in business since 1840Farlows of Pall Mall Website * TheFlyStop – An online fly merchant since 2004TheFlyStop Fly Fishing Chart * Umpqua Feather Merchants – An American artificial fly manufacturer and wholesaler in business since 1972Umpqua Feather Merchants Fly Gallery =Dry flies= Dry flies are designed to be buoyant, or land softly on the surface of the water. Dry flies typically represent the adult form of an aquatic or terrestrial insect. Dry flies are generally considered freshwater flies. =Wet flies= Wet flies are designed to sink below the surface of the water. Wet flies have been tied in a wide variety of patterns to represent larvae, nymphs, pupa, drowned insects, baitfish and other underwater prey. Wet flies are generally considered freshwater flies. =Nymph flies= Nymphs are designed to resemble the immature form of aquatic insects and small crustaceans. Nymph flies are generally considered freshwater flies. =Emerger flies= Emergers are designed to resemble the not quite mature hatching aquatic insect as it leaving the water to become an adult insect. Emergers are generally considered freshwater trout flies. =Streamer flies= Streamers are designed to resemble some form of baitfish or other large aquatic prey. Streamer flies may be patterned after both freshwater and saltwater prey species. Streamer flies are a very large and diverse category of flies as streamers are effective for almost any type of gamefish. =Terrestrial flies= Terrestrials are designed to resemble non-aquatic insects, crustaceans and worms that could fall prey to feeding fish after being blown or falling onto the water. =Bass and panfish flies, bugs and poppers= Bass and panfish flies, bugs and poppers are generally designed to resemble both surface and sub-surface insect, crustacean, baitfish prey consumed by warm-water species such as Largemouth bass or bluegill. This genus of flies generally includes patterns that resemble small mammals, birds, amphibians or reptiles that may fall prey to fish, or in the case of panfish flies, small aquatic insects or crustaceans. =Pike and musky flies= Pike and musky flies are generally designed to resemble both surface and sub-surface crustacean, baitfish prey consumed by species of the genus Esox such as Northern Pike or Muskellunge. This genus of flies are larger than bass flies and generally includes patterns that resemble baitfish and small mammals, birds, amphibians or reptiles that may fall prey to fish. =Carp flies= Although many flies from the standard trout repertoire can be successfully used to tempt various species of carp, particularly the common carp, a number of traditional patterns have been modified to make them more appealing to carp. One example would be Barry's Carp Fly,Barry's Carp Fly Step-by-Step Tying Instructions which resembles the familiar thorax-plus-tapered-abdomen structure of many nymphs, albeit in an enlarged and bushier format. Some flies have been designed specifically to target carp, usually to imitate the various vegetative sources of food that omnivorous carp feed on such as berries, seeds, and flowers that may fall into the water. This small niche of the fly fishing / fly tying world began to grow dramatically in size and legitimacy around 2010 as a hitherto underground movement started to go mainstream in the United States, leading to numerous innovations. Several of those, like the family of so-called \\"headstand\\"Flies for Carp flies, represent the most significant departures from traditional freshwater designs in many years. =Salmon flies= Salmon flies are a traditional class of flies tied specifically to fly fish for Atlantic Salmon. Some salmon flies may be classified as lures while others may be classified as dry flies, such as the bomber. Salmon flies are also tied in classic and contemporary patterns. =Steelhead and Pacific salmon flies= Steelhead and Pacific salmon flies are designed for catching anadromous steelhead trout and pacific salmon in western North American and Great Lakes rivers. =Egg flies= Egg flies are all designed to resemble the spawn of other fish that may be encountered in a river and consumed by the target species. =Flesh flies= Flesh flies are designed to resemble the rotting flesh of pacific salmon encountered in a river and consumed by the target species. =Saltwater flies= Saltwater flies are a class of flies designed to represent a wide variety of inshore, offshore and estuarial saltwater baitfish, crustacean and other saltwater prey. Most of the time you see a pattern it will be represent a shrimp, crab, baitfish, or a combination of them. Saltwater flies generally are found in both sub-surface and surface patterns. =Bonefish flies= Bonefish flies are a special class of saltwater flies used to catch bonefish in shallow water. Bonefish flies generally resemble small crabs, shrimp or other crustaceans. =Tarpon flies= Tarpon flies are a special class of saltwater flies used to catch tarpon in both inshore and offshore waters. Tarpon flies generally represent small baitfish commonly preyed upon by tarpon. =Striped bass flies= Striped bass flies are a special class of freshwater-saltwater fly used to catch striped bass in freshwater, inshore and offshore waters. Striped bass flies generally represent small baitfish commonly preyed upon by striped bass. =Tube flies= A tube fly is a general tying style of artificial fly. Tube flies differ from traditional artificial flies as they are tied on small diameter tubes, not hooks. Tube flies were originated in Aberdeen, Scotland by fly-dresser Minnie Morawski for Atlantic salmon anglers around 1945. Tube flies were designed to improve hooking success and to prevent damage to complex and expensive salmon flies by the teeth of hooked salmon. Tube flies have been widely adapted to fly patterns for a variety of cold water and warm water species and are extremely popular for steelhead and salmon in the Pacific Northwest and northeast United States, as well as saltwater species along the Atlantic, Florida and Gulf Coasts. They are widely used in European waters for Atlantic salmon, sea trout and pike.

Pierre Vidal-Naquet, a French historian, confessed that there were \\"hundreds of thousands of instances of torture\\" by the French military in Algeria. The FLN engaged in the use of torture against pro-French and uncommitted members of the Algerian population in retaliation for the French's use of torture.A Savage War of Peace – Algeria 1954–62, Alistair Horne Overview The armed struggle of the FLN and of its armed wing, the Armée de Libération Nationale (ALN) was for self-determination. The French state itself refused to see the colonial conflict as a war, as that would recognize the other party (the National Liberation Front, FLN) as a legitimate entity. Thus, until 10 August 1999, the French Republic persisted in calling the Algerian War a simple \\"operation of public order\\" against the FLN \\"terrorism.\\"COLONIALISM THROUGH THE SCHOOL BOOKS – The hidden history of the Algerian war, Le Monde diplomatique, April 2001 This was therefore a 'classic' colonial war of liberation, and it is on these different viewpoints (police action vs. war) that much of the argument about these events tends to focus. Thus, the military did not consider themselves tied by the Geneva Conventions, ratified by France in 1951. Besides prohibiting the use of torture, the Geneva Conventions gave the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) access to the detainees. Detainees, who included not only FLN members but also old men, women and children, were thus not granted prisoner of war (POW) status. On the contrary, they were considered as \\"terrorists\\" and deprived of the rights to which belligerents are legally entitled during a war, including cases of civil wars under Geneva Convention Protocol II. Violence increased on both sides from 1954 to 1956. But in 1957 the Minister of Interior declared a state of emergency in Algeria, and the government granted extraordinary powers to General Massu. The Battle of Algiers, from January to October 1957, remains to this day a textbook example of counter- insurgency operations. General Massu's 10e division parachutiste, (10th Paratroop Division) made widespread use of methods used during the Indochina War (1947–54): they included a systematic use of torture, including against civilians, a block warden system (quadrillage), illegal executions and forced disappearances, in particular through what would later become known as \\"death flights\\" (at the time, victims of such methods were known as \\"Bigeard's shrimps\\", or \\"crevettes Bigeard\\"). All these methods were documented as standard counter-insurgency tactics by Colonel Trinquier in Modern Warfare: A French View of Counterinsurgency (1961), a reference in the areas of \\"counter- revolutionary war\\" and of psychological warfare. Although the use of torture quickly became well-known and was opposed by the left-wing opposition, the French state repeatedly denied its employment, censoring more than 250 books, newspapers and films (in metropolitan France alone) which dealt with the subject and 586 in Algeria. Henri Alleg's 1958 book, La Question, Boris Vian's The Deserter, and Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film Le Petit Soldat (released in 1963) are famous examples of such censorship. A confidential report of the ICRC leaked to Le Monde newspaper confirmed the allegations of torture made by the opposition to the war, represented in particular by the French Communist Party (PCF) and other anti-militarist circles. Although many left-wing activists, including famous existentialists writers Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, and historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet, denounced without exception the use of torture, the French government was itself headed in 1957 by the general secretary of the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Guy Mollet. In general, the SFIO supported the colonial wars during the Fourth Republic (1947–54), starting with the crushing of the Madagascar revolt in 1947 by the socialist government of Paul Ramadier. The controversy over the use of torture continues to have echoes today. Already in 1977, British historian Alistair Horne wrote in A Savage War of Peace that torture was to become a growing cancer for France, leaving behind a poison that would linger in the French system long after the war itself had ended. At the time, Horne could not confirm or deny that torture had been ordered by the highest ranks of the military and civilian hierarchy of the French state. Despite France's difficulties in looking at its past, which is made evident by the obstacles it continues to put before the historical research, and the way the Algerian War is taught (or not) in French high-schools, the fact that torture had not only been massively employed, but also ordered by the French government, was confirmed by General Paul Aussaresses in 2001. These revelations followed testimony from a former tortured ALN activist, Louisette Ighilahriz, published in Le Monde on 20 July 2000, three days after the visit to France of Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Louisette Ighilahriz declared that she had been tortured for three months and accused as the responsible party General Massu as the then-commander of the French armed forces. Massu used this opportunity to publicly regret the use of torture, declaring that it could have been avoided. On the other hand, General Bigeard violently denied its use.Louisette Ighilahriz: \\" Massu ne pouvait plus nier l’évidence \\", L'Humanité, 23 November 2000 In 2001, General Aussaresses confessed in his book \\"Services spéciaux, Algérie 1955–1957\\" (2001) to having engaged in torture and illegal executions, on direct orders from General Massu. Aussaresses declared that torture had been directly ordered by Guy Mollet's government. Paul Aussaresses was condemned for \\"apologism for war crimes\\" because he had justified the use of torture, claiming it had helped to save lives.condamnation du général Aussaresses pour \\"apologie de crimes de guerre\\" , Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, Human Rights League), February 2002. Although Aussaresses claimed that torture was an efficient way to fight against what he saw as FLN terrorism, recent historical research demonstrates that, contrary to the popular \\"ticking time bomb scenario\\", torture was not used for short-term intelligence purposes. Instead, the aim of torture was not to make people talk but to affect the armed groups as a whole and to break the civilian population's morale. Torture was a part of the psychological warfare methods as theorized by General Salan and others (Branche, 2004). The 2004 Court of Cassation judgment condemning Aussaresses stated that \\"freedom to inform, which is the basis of freedom of expression\\" does not lead to \\"accompany the exposure of facts ... with commentaries justifying acts contrary to human dignity and universally reproved nor to glorify its author.\\"French: Sur la liberté d'expression revendiquée par le général et les deux éditeurs (Plon et Perrin), elle souligne que celui qui se réclame du droit à l'information n’a pas pour autant à accompagner l'exposé des faits qu’il rapporte \\"de commentaires propres à justifier des actes contraires à la dignité humaine universellement réprouvés, ni de glorifier l'auteur de tels actes\\".La condamnation du général Aussaresses pour apologie de la torture est maintenant définitive , LDH, 11 December 2004 (mirroring an Agence France- Presse news cable). Colonialism Torture was a procedure in use since the beginning of the colonization of Algeria, which was initiated by the July Monarchy in 1830. Directed by Marshall Bugeaud, who became the first Governor- General of Algeria, the conquest of Algeria was marked by a \\"scorched earth\\" policy and the use of torture, which were legitimized by a racist ideology. In 1841, the liberal thinker and deputy Alexis de Tocqueville could declare: > War in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone > can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the > greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to > have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science...

However, Le Cour Grandmaison's work has been criticized by Gilbert Meynier and Pierre Vidal- Naquet in an article published in Esprit.Gilbert Meynier and Pierre Vidal- Naquet, Esprit, December 2005, pp. 162–177 Other historians also show that torture was fully a part of the colonialist system: \\"Torture in Algeria was engraved in the colonial act, it is the \\"normal\\" illustration of an abnormal system\\", wrote Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard, and Sandrine Lemaire, who have published decisive work on the phenomena of \\"human zoos.\\"Nicolas Bancel, Pascal Blanchard and Sandrine Lemaire, TORTURE IN ALGERIA: PAST ACTS THAT HAUNT FRANCE – False memory, Le Monde diplomatique, June 2001 From the smokings (enfumades) of the Darha caves in 1844 by Pélissier to the 1945 riots in Sétif, Guelma and Kherrata\\", the repression in Algeria has used the same methods.

It remained however, on both banks, a practice tolerated by the authorities and a form of violence to which Algerians knew they could be subjected.\\"French: « en métropole, la torture n'atteint pas la même ampleur qu'en Algérie. Elle n'en demeure pas moins sur les deux rives, une pratique tolérée par les autorités et une violence à laquelle les Algériens savent pouvoir s'attendre. » Context and descriptions of torture: scope and extent Early in the war, the FLN was progressively assuming control in Algeria through targeted acts of terrorism against French nationals and Algerians supporting the French. From 1954 to 1956, the amount of violence massively increased, accompanied by summary executions and internment in camps. Justified by the notion of \\"terrorism\\", torture was used indiscriminately against military detainees and civilians suspected of aiding the FLN. General Salan, commander-in-chief of the French forces in Algeria, had developed in Indochina a theory of \\"counter- revolutionary warfare\\" that included the use of torture. The ICRC was authorized by Radical-Socialist prime minister Pierre Mendès France on 2 February 1955, to have access to the detainees for short missions of one month, but their report \\"was not to be made public.\\" His government had to resign three days later. According to historian Raphaëlle Branche, \\"it was as if Mendès France was preparing for his departure by setting up as many protective barriers as possible.\\" The French Army did not consider the detainees as POW's, but as PAM (French acronym for \\"taken captive while in possession of weapons\\", pris les armes à la main). =The Battle of Algiers (January–October 1957), the state of emergency and the ICRC report= The civilian authorities relinquished control to the military during the Battle of Algiers from January to October 1957. Thus, General Jacques Massu, commander of the 10th Parachute Division (10e DP), in charge during the Battle of Algiers, was to crush the insurgency by whatever means necessary. They threw hundreds of prisoners into the sea from the port of Algiers or by helicopter death flights. Since the corpses sometimes came back up to the surface, they began to pour concrete on their feet. These victims were known as \\"Bigeard's shrimps\\" (\\"crevettes Bigeard\\") after the surname of a notorious paratroop helicopter commander.Film testimony by Paul Teitgen, Jacques Duquesne and Hélie Denoix de Saint Marc on the INA archive website Henri Pouillot, mon combat contre la torture, El Watan, 1 November 2004.Des guerres d’Indochine et d’Algérie aux dictatures d’Amérique latine, interview with Marie-Monique Robin by the Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, Human Rights League), 10 January 2007. French military chaplains quieted the troubled military's consciences. One of them, Louis Delarue, wrote a text distributed to all units: > If, in the general interest, the law allows a murderer to be killed, why > should it be seen as monstrous to submit a delinquent who has been > recognized as such, and is therefore liable to be put to death, to an > interrogation which might be painful but whose only object is, thanks to the > revelations he may make about his accomplices and leaders, to protect the > innocent? Exceptional circumstances call for exceptional measures.Quoted by > Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky in Breaking the silence: the Catholic > Church and the \\"dirty war\\" , 28 July 2005, extract from El Silencio transl. > in English by openDemocracy (p.3). In 1958 General Salan set up special military internment centers for PAM rebels. The Minister of Interior declared a state of emergency, while the army engaged in a \\"struggle against the terrorism\\" of the FLN. Special powers were devolved to the military and were returned to civilian powers only in September 1959, when Charles de Gaulle made his speech on self-determination. General Salan refused to apply the Geneva Conventions ratified by France in 1951 because the detainees were not POW's. The civil authorities had different attitudes concerning the use of torture by the military. The IGAME (Inspecteur général en mission extraordinaire) of both Oran and Algiers chose to avoid the issue, whereas the IGAME of Constantinois, Maurice Papon (who died in 2007 after having been convicted for crimes against humanity for his role under Vichy), was actively involved in repression (Branche, 2004). On 5 January 1960 the newspaper Le Monde published a summary of the report on the ICRC's seventh mission to Algeria. \\"Numerous cases of ill-treatment and torture are still being reported\\", the article disclosed, giving the ICRC's legitimacy to the many previously documented cases. A colonel in the French police force had told the delegates, \\"The struggle against terrorism makes it necessary to resort to certain questioning techniques as the only way of saving human life and avoiding new attacks.\\" (Branche, 2004). It was found much later that Gaston Gosselin, a member of the Ministry of Justice who was responsible for internment issues in metropolitan France, had leaked the report to the journalists of Le Monde. He had to resign a few months later, and the ICRC was prohibited for a year from undertaking any mission to Algeria.Torture in Algeria. The report that was to change everything, ICRC, 19 August 2005 =Other testimony and descriptions= Henri Alleg, director of the Alger Républicain newspaper and of the Algerian Communist Party (PCA), who himself had been tortured, denounced it in La Question (Minuit, 1958), which sold 60,000 copies in one day.The torture of Algiers, Adam Shatz, The New York Review of Books, 21 November 2002 (mirrored by Algeria Watch NGO) The title of his book referred to the Inquisition, who was said to put people \\"to the question.\\" Alleg's book detailed the various torture methods, which included the infamous gégène, an electricity generator initially used for telephones, sleep deprivation, and truth serums, etc. Beside torturing actual suspects, the French military also buried alive old men. Benoist Rey's book Les égorgeurs was also censored in April 1961. In the same year, he denounced torture as a \\"habitual repressive method, systematic, official, and massive.\\" According to an article of Verité Liberté published in 1961, \\"In the Ameziane farm, a CRA (Centre de renseignement et d'action, Information and Action Center) of Constantine it is practiced on \\"industrial scale\\". The suspects were arrested during raids, after having been denounced. Suspects were divided into two groups, those immediately interrogated and those who would be forced to wait a bit. The latter were deprived of food for from two to eight days in a blatant violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\\" According to historian R. Branche, torture would begin with the systematic stripping of the victim. Beating was combined with many different techniques, among them hanging by the feet or hands, water torture, torture by electric shock, and rape. It was described by \\"Verité Liberté\\": > The interrogatories is done in accordance with the provisional guide of the > intelligence agent (Guide provisoire de l'officier de renseignement, OR), > chapter IV: first, the officer questions the prisoner in the \\"traditional\\" > manner, hitting him with fist and kicking him.

We must point out that > some of them were very young teenagers and others old men of 75, 80 years or > more.Text published in Vérité Liberté n°9 May 1961. According to the \\"Vérité Liberté\\", the end of these torture sessions was either liberation (often the case for women and for those who could pay), internment, or \\"disappearance.\\" \\"The capacity of this center, opened in 1957, is of 500 to 600 persons...Since its constitution, it has \\"controlled\\" (incarcerated for fewer than 8 days) 108,175 persons; filed 11,518 Algerians as nationalist activists...; kept for a duration of more than 8 days 7,363 persons; interned to Hamma [an internment camp] 789 suspects.\\" Controversy during the war The systematic use of torture created a national controversy which has had lasting effects on French and Algerian society. As early as 2 November 1954, Catholic writer François Mauriac called against the use of torture in L'Express in an article titled Surtout, ne pas torturer (\\"Above all, do not torture.\\"). Two important officials, one civilian and another military, resigned because of the use of torture. The first was Paul Teitgen, former General Secretary of the Algiers Police, who had been himself tortured by the Gestapo. He resigned on 12 September 1957, in protest against the massive use of torture and extrajudicial killings. The other was General de Bollardière, who was the only army official to denounce the use of torture.le général Jacques de Bollardière , Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH) October 2001. He was put in charge of military arrests and then had to resign. Torture was denounced during the war by many French left-wing intellectuals, members or not of the PCF, which maintained an anti-colonialist line. Under pressure from the left-wing opposition to the war and the use of torture, including the French Communist Party (PCF),France confronts Algeria torture claims, BBC, 9 January 2001 the government, then led by Guy Mollet (SFIO), created a Commission of Safeguard of Rights and Individual Liberties, composed of various personalities named by the government, which gave the public its report in September 1957: according to it, torture was a frequent practice in Algeria. However, some claim that the main aim was in fact to absolve the French army of accusations and to gain time (Raphaëlle Branche, 2004). Henri Alleg, denounced it in La Question, which along with La Gangrène, by Bachir Boumaza, and Italian Communist Gillo Pontecorvo's 1966 film The Battle of Algiers were censored in France. Torture was also evoked during the trial of ALN activist Djamila Boupacha, defended by lawyer Gisèle Halimi. Writer Albert Camus, a Pied-noir and famous existentialist, tried unsuccessfully to persuade both sides to at least leave civilians alone, writing editorials against the use of torture in Combat newspaper. Other famous opponents of torture included Robert Bonnaud, who published on counsel of his friend Pierre Vidal-Naquet an article in 1956 in L'Esprit, a personalist review founded by Emmanuel Mounier (1905–1950). Bonnaud was later imprisoned in June 1961, on a charge of supporting the FLN. Pierre Vidal-Naquet, one of the many signatories to the Manifeste des 121 against torture,Manifeste des 121, transl. in English. wrote a book, L'Affaire Audin (1957), and, as a historian, would continue to work on the Algerian War all his life. Beside Vidal-Naquet, famous signatories of the Manifeste des 121, published after the 1960 Barricades Week, included Robert Antelme, an Auschwitz survivor and writer, writers Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Blanchot, Pierre Boulez, writer André Breton, Hubert Damisch, writer Marguerite Duras, Daniel Guérin, Robert Jaulin, Claude Lanzmann, Robert Lapoujade, Henri Lefebvre, writer Michel Leiris, Jérôme Lindon, editor of the Minuit publishing house, François Maspero, another editor, Théodore Monod, Maurice Nadeau, Jean-François Revel, Alain Robbe-Grillet, author and founder of the nouveau roman, writers Françoise Sagan, Nathalie Sarraute, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Claude Simon, Jean Bruller (Vercors), Jean-Pierre Vernant, Frantz Fanon, etc. According to Henri Alleg, \\"in reality, the base of the problem was this unjust war itself. From the moment one starts a colonial war, i.e. a war to submit a people to one's will, one can issue all the laws one wants, but they will always be violated.\\"French: \\"En réalité, le fond du problème était cette guerre injuste elle-même. À partir du moment où on mène une guerre coloniale, c’est-à-dire une guerre pour soumettre un peuple à sa volonté, on peut édicter toutes les lois que l'on veut, il y aura toujours des dépassements.\\" from Henri Alleg, Colonisation: A Crime Against Humanity , first half of the interview published by Politis on 8 September 2005 (complete interview on the Ligue des droits de l'homme's website) Torture and the OAS Pierre Vidal-Naquet (1930–2006), one of the leaders of the Comité Audin, had denounced the systematic use of torture by the 10e DP during the 1957 Battle of Algiers. But he also denounced the non-systematic use of torture, mainly beatings, by the French Army on members of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), a far-right terrorist group which after the March 1962 Évian Accords engaged in a campaign of bombings directed against the civilian population in Algeria. He wrote a letter in L'Esprit in May 1962: > Have OAS activists or sympathizers been tortured during these last months in > Algeria?... far-right weekly newspapers, La Nation française, Rivarol, > Carrefour have started to publish articles on crimes committed against > supporters of French Algeria.

Little firm evidence exists about the use of torture by either side in France, but there were instances where French police or police auxiliaries may have engaged in torture as well as murder of FLN agents or protesters, and likewise the FLN may have used torture in eliminating opponents and collecting funds among Algerian expatriates in France. From 1954 onward, the FLN sought to establish a politico-military organization among the 300,000 Algerians residing in France; by 1958, it had overwhelmed Messali Hadj's Algerian National Movement, despite the latter's popularity with Algerian expatriates at the onset of the war. Torture was occasionally used alongside beatings and killings to eliminate opponents of the FLN, and the death toll of this internecine violence within France alone was approximately 4,000. Subsequently, the FLN used this organization to obtain a \\"revolutionary tax\\" that FLN leader Ali Haroun estimates amounted to \\"80% of the [financial] resources of the rebellion\\"; this was partly done through extortion, in some instances by means of beatings and torture.Guy Chambarlac, \\"Tueurs et porteurs de valise\\", in Enquêtes sur l'Histoire, volume 15 (Winter 1996). After being involved in early repression in Constantine, Algeria as prefect, Maurice Papon was named head of the Parisian police on 14 March 1958. Tensions increased after 25 August 1958, when an FLN guerilla offensive in Paris killed three policemen on boulevard de l'Hôpital in the 13th arrondissement and another in front of the cartoucherie de Vincennes, leading to arrests and jailing of Algerians suspected of supporting the FLN. In 1960 Papon created the Auxiliary Police Force (FPA – Force de police auxiliaire), which was made up of 600 Algerians by Autumn 1960 and operated in areas densely populated by Algerians in Paris and its suburbs. While incompletely evidenced, the strongest presumption of torture by the FPA pertains to two locations in the 13th arrondissement.Jean-Luc Einaudi and Maurice Rajsfus, 2001, op.cit., p.75 Further escalation occurred from August to October 1961 as the FLN resumed bombings against the French police, and killing 11 policemen and injured 17 (in Paris and its suburbs). This culminated on 17 October 1961, when the French police suppressed a demonstration by 30,000 Algerians who were ostensibly protesting against a de facto curfew imposed on them by the prefecture of police, though the FLN had planned the demonstration as a potential provocation as well.Ali Haroun, La 7e wilaya: La guerre du FLN en France, 1954–1962, Le Seuil, 1986, While estimates differ, the number of dead officially acknowledged (in French government reports and statements of 1998) in putting down this demonstration was 40 to 48. Some protesters may have been tortured before being killed and having their bodies thrown in the Seine.Jean- Luc Einaudi: \\"La bataille de Paris: 17 October 1961\\", 1991, An important issue within metropolitan France was public opinion, given that a substantial native population held a formally anticolonialist ideology (Communists, in particular) or was debating the war. The parties fought on this front too. The Prefecture of Police denied using torture or undue violence. Conversely, informers reported an organized campaign to implicate the FPA such that FLN \\"leaders and carefully chosen militants from the workers' residence in Vitry - 45, rue Rondenay - have been tasked with declaring in cafés and public places that they have suffered exactions, were robbed of pocketbooks or watches[...], and were victims of violence by the 'Algerian police'.\\" A note diffused by the French arm of the FLN to its branches in September 1959 specifically focused on making claims of torture to influence the legal system: > For those of our brothers who will be arrested, it is important to specify > what attitude they must adopt. Regardless of the way that the Algerian > patriot is treated by police, he must in all circumstances, when presented > to the prosecutor state that he has been beaten and tortured... He must > never hesitate to accuse the police of torture and beatings. This greatly > influences the judge and courts. Amnesties No one was brought to justice for crimes committed during the war, not even for the case of Maurice Audin, a young communist university lecturer arrested and tortured to death. The case had been specifically documented at the time by the \\"Comité Audin\\", to which historian Pierre Vidal- Naquet belonged. The first amnesty was passed in 1962 by President Charles de Gaulle, by decree, preempting a parliamentary discussion that might have denied immunity to men like General Paul Aussaresses. The second amnesty was enacted in 1968 by the National Assembly, which gave blanket amnesty to all acts committed during the Algerian war.France Faces Its Demons For Algerian War Brutality, by Keith B. Richburg, Washington Post, Thursday 10 May 2001; Page A26 The OAS members were given amnesty by president François Mitterrand (PS), and a general amnesty for all war crimes was declared in 1982. Pierre Vidal-Naquet, among others, has qualified it as a \\"shame\\".La guerre d’Algérie – bilan d’un engagement: un entretien avec Pierre Vidal-Naquet, 1996, Confluences Méditerranée N°19, Autumn 1996 (re-published by the LDH Human Rights League) The archives of the war were closed to the public for thirty years, a period extendable for up to 60 years for those documents that were liable to compromise a person's privacy or state security. It was only in 1995–96 that new works began to reveal information. 2000s controversies General Jacques Massu, had defended the use of torture in his 1972 book, The True Battle of Algiers (La vraie bataille d'Alger). He later declared to Le Monde in 2000 that \\"torture was not necessary and that we could have decided not to use it\\".French: \\"la torture n'était pas indispensable et l'on aurait très bien pu s'en passer\\". Two days after the visit to France of Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Louisette Ighilahriz, a former Armée de Libération Nationale activist, published her testimony in Le Monde on 20 June 2000. At the age of twenty she had been captured in September 1957, during the Battle of Algiers, and raped and tortured for three months. She named General Massu as the responsible of the French military at the time. Massu, 94 years old, acknowledged Ighilahriz's testimony and declared to 'Le Monde' that \\"Torture isn't indispensable in times of war, and one can very well do without it. When l look back on Algeria, it saddens me... One could have done things differently.\\" To the contrary, General Bigeard (then Colonel) called her remarks a \\"tissue of lies\\", while Aussaresses justified it =General Aussaresses' 2000 confession and condemnation= General Paul Aussaresses admitted in his 2001 book, \\"Services spéciaux, Algérie 1955–1957\\", to the systematic use of torture during the war. He confessed to having himself engaged in torture and having himself illegally executed 24 Algerians, under the orders of Guy Mollet's government. He also acknowledged the assassination of lawyer Ali Boumendjel and head of FLN in Algiers, and Larbi Ben M'Hidi, which had been covered up as \\"suicides.\\" For justifying the use of torture, he was condemned in court, and stripped of his army rank and his Legion of honor.French veteran fined for excusing torture, BBC News, 25 January 2002L'accablante confession du général Aussaresses sur la torture en Algérie, Le Monde, 3 May 2001. According to Aussaresses, Massu followed on a daily basis the list of \\"interrogated\\" prisoners and of \\"accidents\\" which occurred during these torture sessions. Aussaresses said that it had been directly ordered by Guy Mollet's government. He notably declared: > I have given daily accounts of my activity to my direct superior, General > Massu, who informed the Chief of Staff. It would have been possible for the > political or military authority to put an end to it at any moment.French: > \\"J'ai rendu compte tous les jours de mon activité à mon supérieur direct, le > Général Massu, lequel informaitle commandant en chef. Il aurait été loisible > à toute autorité politique ou militaire responsible d'y mettre fin.\\"Human > Rights Watch: le gouvernement français doit ordonner une enquête officielle. > , Human Rights Watch. He also wrote: > Concerning the use of torture, it was tolerated, if not recommended. > François Mitterrand, the Minister of Justice, had, as a matter of fact, an > emissary near [General] Massu in the person of judge Jean Bérard who covered > us and knew exactly what was going on at night.French: \\"Quant à > l'utilisation de la torture, elle était tolérée, sinon recommandée. François > Mitterrand, le ministre de la Justice, avait, de fait, un émissaire auprès > de [Général] Massu en la personne du juge Jean Bérard qui nous couvrait et > qui avait une exacte connaissance de ce qui se passait la nuit.\\" However, historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet said, concerning Mitterrand, who was President of France from 1981 to 1995, that \\"when he was Justice Minister in 1956–57, during the Algerian War, he has been not as bad as had been claimed. He had under his charge only civil justice, and Reliquet (the public prosecutor in Algiers and who was a liberal [i.e. \\"liberal\\" in French usually refers to economic liberalism]) personally told me that he never received such strict instructions against torture as that which he had had from Mitterrand.\\" Following Aussaresses' revelations, which proved that torture had been ordered by the highest levels of the French state hierarchy, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to President Jacques Chirac (RPR) to indict Aussaresses for war crimes, declaring that, despite past amnesties, such crimes, which may also have been crimes against humanity, may not be amnestied. The Ligue des droits de l'homme (LDH, Human Rights League) deposed a complaint against him for \\"apology of war crimes\\", as Paul Aussaresses justified the use of torture, claiming it had saved lives. He was condemned to a 7,500 Euros fine by the Tribunal de grande instance court of Paris, while Plon and Perrin, two editing houses who had published his book in which he made an apology of the use of torture, were sentenced each to a 15,000 Euros fine. The judgement was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in April 2003. The Court of Cassation rejected the intercession in December 2004. The Court of Cassation declared in its judgment that \\"freedom to inform, which is the basis of freedom of expression\\" does not lead to \\"accompany the exposure of facts ... with commentaries justifying acts contrary to human dignity and universally reproved\\", \\"nor to glorify its author.\\" Aussaresses had written in his book: \\"torture became necessary when emergency imposed itself.\\"La condamnation du général Aussaresses pour apologie de la torture est maintenant définitive , LDH, 11 December 2004 (mirroring an Agence France-Presse news cable) However, the Court of Cassation rejected the complaint which had been deposed against him on charges of torture, claiming they were amnestied. =Bigeard's attitude= General Marcel Bigeard, who had denied employing torture for forty years, finally also admitted that it had been used, although he claimed that he personally had not engaged in the practice. Bigeard, who qualified FLN activists as \\"savages\\", claimed torture was a \\"necessary evil.\\"GUERRE D'ALGÉRIE : le général Bigeard et la pratique de la torture, Le Monde, 4 July 2000. Torture Bigeard: \\" La presse en parle trop \\" , L'Humanité, 12 May 2000. To the contrary, General Jacques Massu denounced it, following Aussaresses' revelations, and before his death pronounced himself in favor of an official condemnation of the use of torture during the war.La torture pendant la guerre d’Algérie / 1954 – 1962 40 ans après, l’exigence de vérité , AIDH. Bigeard's justification of torture has been criticized by various persons, among whom Joseph Doré, archbishop of Strasbourg, and Marc Lienhard, president of the Lutheran Church of the Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine.GUERRE D'ALGÉRIE : Mgr Joseph Doré et Marc Lienhard réagissent aux déclarations du général Bigeard justifiant la pratique de la torture par l'armée française , Le Monde, 15 July 2000. In June 2000, Bigeard declared that he was based in Sidi Ferruch, known as a torture center from which many Algerians never left alive. Bigeard qualified Louisette Ighilahriz's revelations, published in Le Monde on 20 June 2000, as \\"lies\\". An ALN activist, Louisette Ighilahriz, had been tortured by General Massu. She herself called Bigeard a \\"liar\\", and criticized him for continuing to deny the use of torture 40 years later.Louisette Ighilahriz: \\" Massu ne pouvait plus nier l’évidence \\", L'Humanité, 23 November 2000. However, since General Massu's revelations, Bigeard has now admitted the use of torture, although he denies having personally used it. He then declared: \\"You are striking the heart of an 84-year-old man.\\" Bigeard also recognized that Larbi Ben M’Hidi had been assassinated, and his death disguised as a \\"suicide\\". =Jean-Marie Le Pen= Jean-Marie Le Pen, former leader of the far-right National Front party and a lieutenant during the war, attacked Le Monde and former Prime minister Michel Rocard on charges of defamation after the newspaper accused him of having engaged in torture.Le chef du FN oppose un « démenti formel » aux accusations de torture, Le Monde, 9 June 2002. However, he lost his trial, with the French justice declaring Le Monde's investigations as legitimate and credible, though Le Pen appealed.Le Pen et la torture, l'enquete du \\"Monde\\" validée par le tribunal, Le Monde, 28 June 2003. Le Pen still denies the use of torture, claiming there had been only \\"interrogation sessions\\". Le Monde produced in May 2003 the dagger he allegedly used to commit war crimes as court evidence.L'affaire du poignard du lieutenant Le Pen en Algérie, Le Monde, 17 May 2003. This affair ended in 2000 when the \\"Cour de cassation\\" (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the prescription, there can be no criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur (French Communist Party) for the same reason.\\"J'ai croisé Le Pen à la villa Sésini\\" (I crossed Le Pen in the Sesini Villa), interview with Paul Aussaresses (who had argued in favor of the use of torture in Algeria), Le Monde, 4 June 2002.\\"Un lourd silence\\", Le Monde, 5 May 2002. \\"Quand Le Pen travaillait 20 heures par jour\\" in L'Humanité (freely accessible), 2 May 2002. \\"New Revelations on Le Pen, tortionary\\" in L'Humanité, 4 June 2002. \\"Le Pen attaque un élu du PCF en justice\\", in L'Humanité, 4 April 1995. Jean Dufour: \\"Le Pen vient d'être débouté\\", in L'Humanité, 26 July 1995. \\"Torture: Le Pen perd son procès en diffamation contre Le Monde\\", in L'Humanité, 27 June 2003. Pierre Vidal-Naquet in \\"Torture; Cancer of Democracy\\" alleges that, after being refused a drink at an already closed bar in Algiers, Le Pen had the bartender tortured to death. \\"The French School\\" and \\"The American School\\" There are both French and U.S. pathways that explain the spread of torture, including methods used in Algeria, to Latin American regimes allied with the West from the 1960s onwards. Regarding the French pathway, journalist Marie-Monique Robin argued in her 2004 book on death squads how French intelligence agents had taught their Chilean and Argentine counterparts the use of torture and \\"disappearances\\" as a counter-insurgency tactic.Marie- Monique Robin, Escadrons de la mort, l'école française, La Découverte (15 September 2004). Collection: Cahiers libres. (). Her argument was based on several filmed interviews of high-ranking Argentine military officers, who were themselves accused of torture at the time.La Escuela Francesa, escuadrones de la muerte (French, English, Spanish – Spanish subtitles), broadcast on Mefeedia French intelligence agents have long been suspected of having trained their Argentine counterparts in \\"counter-insurgency\\" techniques. In testimony in January 2007 before Argentine judges, Luis María Mendía, Argentine Admiral and originator of the \\"death flights\\" during the \\"Dirty War\\", referred to Marie Monique Robin's film documentary titled The Death Squads – the French School (Les escadrons de la mort – l'école française), which argued that the French intelligence services had trained Argentine counterparts in counter-insurgency techniques. Attempting to exonerate himself, Luis María Mendía used this source to ask that former French president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, former French premier Pierre Messmer, former French ambassador to Buenos Aires Françoise de la Gosse, and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983 be brought before the court.“Impartí órdenes que fueron cumplidas”, Página/12, 2 February 2007. Robin also argued that a 1959 agreement between France and Argentina instaured a \\"permanent French military mission\\" which was located in the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Armed Forces. However the argument is questionable as Robin argued that the mission consisted of veterans of the Algerian War, which would have been extremely unlikely at the onset of the purported mission (since the war in Algeria was ongoing) and remains an undocumented claim even after 1962. The French role in spreading torture to Latin America appears modest, in terms of geographic scope and seniority of the officers involved, relative to local and other foreign sources. During the 1960s, the U.S. started spreading the use of torture to its allies in Latin America, specifically torture using electrical generators, with Brazil and Andean cone countries first.Torture, American style, The Boston Globe, Darius Rejali, 16 December 2007. The training of Latin American officers, including a number of future tortionists and leaders who ordered torture, was conducted on a large scale via the formal education programs of the School of the Americas. This U.S. pathway leads directly to SOA graduate Leopoldo Galtieri, the Argentine dictator and commanding officer of Luis María Mendía. It is under Galtieri's regime that the use of torture became systematic in Argentina; other countries where SOA graduates were accused of involvement in torture or political murders include Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Panama and Haiti.H. R. 611: To close the United States Army School of the Americas, bill before the U.S. House of Representatives bill, Library of Congress, 5 February 1997. The French and U.S. pathways have a common root, as the use of electrical generators for torture was invented in America in 1908, spread in Asia during World War II, and passed to both French and U.S. forces during their respective involvement in the First Indochina War and the Vietnam War (or Second Indochina War). John McGuffin's book \\"Beating the Terrorists\\" (Penguin) also alleges that French advisors were seen at Fort Morbut in Aden during the independence war. In that case, regardless of the correctness of this allegation or the mission of these advisors, their role was minute relative to that of the British forces trying to ensure a peaceful transfer of power during Aden Emergency.

Options were taken by the company on this timber and that of surrounding counties. A large sawmill was built west of the city of Georgetown and production began. In 1903, the company was incorporated with a capital of one million dollars. The mill was expanded through the years, and included three separate sawmills, two shipping wharves, several warehouses, and numerous other buildings, including workers' houses, stores, a hotel, a church, etc. The company owned all of these buildings, making the area immediately surrounding the mill a veritable \\"company town\\", (see photo below). In 1913, a disastrous fire destroyed two of the sawmills. A new steel and concrete mill was erected within ten months. At peak production, the company could produce 600,000 board feet (1,400 m³) of lumber per day and was properly proclaimed \\"the largest lumber manufacturing plant on the Atlantic Coast.\\" Due to the effects of the Great Depression, the plant was closed in 1932\\\\. It was a major undertaking to move millions of tons of rock to the two barrier islands at the entrance to the harbor and build \\"jetties\\" of over 11,000 feet on the north and 21, 000 feet on the south entrance of the bay, with steam and sail power. A dredge was built to maintain a channel and, coupled with the railway and the river system, the lumber business flourished. Mills sprang up almost overnight. The Atlantic Coast Lumber Company was the largest in the world with its 5,000,000 board foot (12,000 m³) dock and shed.

He is the son of adventurer Sir Edmund Hillary, who, along with mountaineer Tenzing Norgay, completed the first successful ascent of Mount Everest. When Peter Hillary summited Everest in 1990, he and his father were the first father/son duo to achieve the feat. Hillary has achieved two summits of Everest, an 84-day trek across Antarctica to the South Pole, and an expedition guiding astronaut Neil Armstrong to land a small aircraft at the North Pole. He has climbed many of the world's major peaks, and on 19 June 2008, completed the Seven Summits, reaching the top of the highest mountains on all seven continents, when he summited Denali in Alaska. Personal life Peter Hillary as an infant, with his parents, Louise and Edmund, 1955Peter Edmund Hillary was born in Auckland, New Zealand on 26 December 1954. He had two younger sisters, Sarah Louise and Belinda Mary, and was the eldest of the three children of Sir Edmund Hillary and his first wife, Louise Mary Rose. Peter Hillary received his education at King's College, Auckland and at Auckland University. As a child, Hillary travelled the world extensively. In 1962, when he was seven, his family travelled all over the United States and Canada while Sir Edmund was on an extended lecture tour. On the way back to New Zealand, the Hillary family capped off their year abroad in Nepal for a visit with Tenzing Norgay. Additional travels included trips to the United Kingdom; drives in the deserts of Australia; learning to ski on New Zealand's South Island; climbing New Zealand's highest peak, Mount Cook; and sitting around campfires in the Himalayas. At age eleven, his father took him to climb Mount Everest. On 31 March 1975, after having spent a year in Nepal, Hillary's mother and youngest sister, sixteen-year-old Belinda, were killed when their plane crashed shortly after taking off from a Kathmandu airfield. Hillary, then twenty, was in Assam, India, visiting a friend, when he received the news that there were no survivors in the crash. He described Lady Hillary and Belinda as 'the glue that bonded the family together'. Hillary's climbing friend, Australian Mark Moorhead, died on 15 October 1983 attempting to ascend Makalu, a Himalayan mountain that is the fifth-highest in the world. When Hillary went to pay his respects to the family, he met Moorhead's sister Ann, whom he would later marry. They separated in 1993 when Hillary began talking about resuming his mountaineering career after a three-year hiatus, and were subsequently divorced. Hillary later married Yvonne Oomen, with whom he has two children, Alexander and Lily-Louise as well as adopted daughter Madeleine- Louise; he also has two children, Amelia and George, from his first marriage. On 11 January 2008, Hillary was in Lisbon, Portugal, at a dinner with some clients when he was informed his father had died of a sudden heart attack at Auckland Hospital. Sir Edmund lay in state at the Auckland Cathedral of the Holy Trinity and his funeral on 22 January 2008 at Auckland's St. Mary's Church was televised live throughout New Zealand. Hillary delivered a eulogy for his father in which he said, recalling his childhood, 'Growing up in the Hillary family, was quite an adventure... Adventure was compulsory'. On 29 February 2008, Hillary, his sister Sarah, and Sir Edmund's widow, Lady Hillary (formerly June Anderson Mulgrew) scattered most of his ashes, in a private ceremony held on Auckland's Hauraki Gulf, from the youth sail training ship Spirit of New Zealand. Apa Sherpa, who at the time had summited Everest more than anyone else, proposed a small portion of Sir Edmund's ashes should be held in reserve to be scattered on the summit of Mount Everest, and Hillary transferred them to a nearby Nepalese monastery. However, in 2010, a committee of Sherpas decided against it, concerned that it could set a precedent. After Sir Edmund's death, there was an immediate clash between his son and his widow over the future of the Himalayan Trust that Sir Edmund had established to assist the people of Nepal, resulting in Hillary not being appointed to its board of directors. In 2010, Hillary and his sister had to get an injunction to stop Lady Hillary from having their father's watches sold through a Swiss auction house, including one that was presented to him after his Everest triumph. Hillary said he and his sister owned the watches as per their father's will. It was ruled that, under New Zealand's heritage laws, the Everest watch should never have left the country and was a violation of the Protected Objects Act. Lady Hillary had to withdraw the items from auction. Hillary then spent a year in mediation attempting to establish ownership of the watches and other items that were of great significance to the family, as Lady Hillary had given away an additional 17 items of sentimental value without consulting the family. When the courts awarded ownership of the watches to Sir Edmund's children, Hillary donated them to the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Finally, in October 2011, Lady Hillary resigned as the head of the Himalayan Trust, with five additional board members going with her. Mount Everest Hillary has been to Everest five times, once reaching 8,300 metres on the West Ridge and twice reaching the summit by the South Col route. With his first summit of Mount Everest in 1990, he and Sir Edmund became the first father and son to achieve the feat. His second ascent in May 2003 was part of a National Geographic Society expedition to mark the 50th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's historic first ascent in 1953. The anniversary expedition brought together Peter Hillary, Jamling Norgay and Brent Bishop, the sons of Sir Edmund, Tenzing Norgay, and Barry Bishop, a member of the first successful American team to reach the summit in 1963. The 1990 expedition was led by veteran Everest climber Pete Athans, who holds the record for the most summits of Everest by a Western climber.  Philanthropy  Peter Hillary now devotes most of his time to fundraising in support of his father's Himalayan Trust, which was established in 1960 to fund capital projects in the Khumbu Valley region of Nepal. He is also a director of the Australian Himalayan Foundation. Hillary is also the patron for the Everest Rescue Trust, a non-profit, independent trust set up to operate and manage a self-funding rescue helicopter service for the high altitude regions of Nepal. Since 2017, Hillary has also been the Patron of the Kea Conservation Trust, a Charitable Trust set up in 2006 to support conservation and research into New Zealand's Alpine parrot, the Kea. Media Peter Hillary has written and co- written several books, including: A Sunny Day in the Himalayas (1980); First Across the Roof of the World: The First-ever Traverse of the Himalayas, 5,000 Kilometres from Sikkim to Pakistan (with Graham Dingle, 1982); Two Generations (with his father, Sir Edmund Hillary, 1984); Ascent: Two Lives Explored – The Autobiographies of Sir Edmund and Peter Hillary (also with his father, 1986); Rimo: Mountain on the Silk Road (1992); Bridgit was Bored (a children's book written with his first wife, Ann Moorhead, 1992); and In the Ghost Country: A Lifetime Spent on the Edge (with John Elder, 2003). Hillary wrote the afterword for the book Letters from Everest: A First-hand Account from the Epic First Ascent by George Lowe, who was Sir Edmund Hillary's best friend and accompanied him on the 1953 Everest expedition. In the wake of the 1996 Mount Everest disaster, Hillary wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine entitled Everest is Mighty, We are Fragile. He also wrote an article called In the Name of the Father, describing what it was like on K2 in August 1995 when the mountain claimed the lives of seven summiters, leaving him as one of three survivors of that expedition. Like many successful adventurers, Peter Hillary has made a career as a professional public speaker, writer, and designer of speciality outdoor equipment. He has also worked as an adventure travel operator and guide, specialising in the Himalayas and Antarctica. Hillary has done numerous television, radio, and satellite interviews in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and his native New Zealand, and participated in several documentaries such as National Geographic's Surviving Everest, celebrating the 50th anniversary of Sir Edmund Hillary's first summit  Awards  * New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal (1990) * Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (2001) * The Explorers Club Lowell Thomas Award (2003) * Mountain Institute Mountain Hero Award (2004) * Circumnavigators Club Order of Magellan (2006) * Tenzing Norgay Award for Mountaineering (2009) References  External links  * Peter Hillary official website * Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand mountain climbers Category:New Zealand philanthropists Category:People from Auckland Category:Summiters of Mount Everest ","title":"Peter Hillary"},{"id":"9470652","text":"Robert Weede (February 22, 1903 - July 9, 1972) was an American operatic baritone. Life and career Lebendige Vergangenheit Born Robert Wiedefeld in Baltimore, Maryland, Weede studied voice at the Eastman School of Music and in Milan. He made his Metropolitan Opera debut in 1937, as Tonio in Pagliacci. His other roles at the Metropolitan included the name part in Rigoletto (opposite Jussi Björling), Amonasro (Aïda), Manfredo (L'amore dei tre re), Shaklovity (Khovanshchina) and Baron Scarpia (Tosca). It was with Rigoletto that he made his debuts in Chicago (1939), San Francisco (1940), and at the New York City Opera (1948). At the New York City Opera, Weede also sang in Pagliacci and in the world premiere of William Grant Still's Troubled Island, opposite Marie Powers, Marguerite Piazza and Robert McFerrin. In Mexico City, the baritone appeared with Maria Callas in 1950, in Aïda and Tosca. Later, he sang again with Callas in Chicago, in Il trovatore and Madama Butterfly. In 1956, he scored a great success on Broadway as Tony Esposito in the original production of Frank Loesser's The Most Happy Fella, which was recorded by Columbia Records. He was also seen on Broadway in Milk and Honey (1961–63, also recorded) and Cry for Us All (1970). Weede's operatic recordings include excerpts from Bizet's Carmen, for Columbia in 1946, with Risë Stevens conducted by Georges Sébastian; and an album of arias by Verdi for Capitol Records in 1953, conducted by Nicola Rescigno. In 2006, Lebendige Vergangenheit published a Compact Disc of excerpts from his Bizet and Verdi recordings, as well as various live performances from 1948 through 1954. Weede often gave assistance to younger singers, especially John Alexander, Dominic Cossa, Mario Lanza, Jan Peerce, Seymour Schwartzman and Norman Treigle.Strange Child of Chaos: Norman Treigle (page 217), by Brian Morgan, iUniverse, 2006.

They were powered by diesel engines and were planned to be armed with a single barreled Squid anti- submarine mortar. This special version of the Squid was a failure however, with the first Ford-class boat, HMS Shalford being fitted with a normal three- barreled Squid and the remaining vessels with a more conventional anti- submarine armament of depth-charge throwers. A single Bofors 40 mm gun completed the armament. HMS Droxford served for a time as the tender for Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities Royal Naval Unit, and was administered by RNR Clyde. The vessel was used to train Midshipmen who were students of the universities and participated in fishery protection duties along the west coast of Scotland.

It ran for approximately 11 miles from Chapel Colliery, at Newmains in North Lanarkshire connecting to the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway near Whifflet, giving a means of transport for minerals around Newmains to market in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Shortage of capital made construction slow, and the line was opened in stages from 1833, opening fully on 9 March 1844. It was built to the track gauge of , commonly used in Scotland for coal railways. It had several branches serving pits and ironworks. In 1849 it became part of the Caledonian Railway and sections of the original network form part of the modern West Coast Main Line railway. Formation of the railway In the early decades of the nineteenth century, the pace of industrialisation in central Scotland accelerated considerably, generating a huge demand for the raw materials of coal and iron ore. Transport of these heavy materials to market was a key issue. Canals offered some solution to this problem, but railways came to be seen as a more accessible option. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway was opened in 1828, giving access to Monklands pits to Glasgow and Edinburgh via the Forth and Clyde Canal, vastly reducing the cost of carriage. Pits further afield saw the benefit to their competitors, and thought of constructing their own lines. A Garturk and Garion Railway Bill was presented to Parliament in 1829Leslie James, A Chronology of the Construction of Britain's Railways, 1778–1855, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1983, E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959 (though Awdry calls it the Garion and Garturk Railway).Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, Journal of the House of Commons, Volume 84, 23 March 1829Garion, etc, was the spelling used at the time. During the parliamentary process the name was changed to the Wishaw and Coltness Railway, and under that name it was incorporated by an Act of Parliament on 1 June 1829. This authorised \\"making a railway from Chapel, in the parish of Cambusnethan, ...by Coltness and Gariongill, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway ... in the parish of Old Monkland\\". Share capital was £80,000 with borrowing powers of £20,000. Tolls were laid down, and \\"the company may provide carriages for the conveyance of passengers, and charge for each person conveyed a rate of 4d per mile\\" and \\"locomotive engines may be used on the railway\\"C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System, 1722–1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Joseph Priestley, Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers Canals and Railways of Great Britain, Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831Popplewell The name of the company refers to the area where minerals would originate. Coltness Colliery was in the area of Wishaw, and both places were some distance from the present-day communities. The northern end of the proposed system was a junction to another railway at Whifflet, and perhaps did not seem an attractive component when the company's name was being chosen. Priestley says that the line was \\"designed to pass from the collieries of Chapel and Crawfoot, in the parish of Cambusnethan, in the county of Lanark, through Daiziel, Hamilton, Bothwell, Coltness, Overtown, Wishawtown, Motherwell, Burnhouse and Carnbroe, to join the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Old Monkland; with a branch to Rosehall; a second to the collieries of Stevenson, Carfin and Cleland; and a third from these last places to Law, in the parish of Carluke, in the same county of Lanark\\". Several of these objectives were never achieved in the independent lifetime of the company. In securing Parliamentary authority, the company had to accept a clause in its Act forbidding the use of locomotives, to overcome the opposition of Drysdale of Jerviston, to a line which, he claimed, \\"would enable the Landed Proprietors south of Major Drysdale to enhance the value of their estates at the expense of his\\". The prohibition was later bought out for £1000, of which the company paid half.Wishaw and Coltness Minutes, 6 Feb 1837, quoted in Robertson Shortage of funds led to further Acts in 1834 and 1837 to obtain three-year extensions for completion of the railway; a further £80,000 of capital was raised by 1840 and this was followed by a further Act in 1841 to raise an addition £160,000 of capital. Opening in stages =First section to Chapelknowe= The route of the first section of the Wishaw and Coltness RailwayThe new company found raising money difficult, and this considerably slowed completion of the line. The first section was opened on 23 January 1834,John Thomas revised J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6, Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, running southwards from a junction with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway at Whifflat Junction (as it was then spelt: immediately east of the present A725 road) to \\"Holytown\\", actually on the Holytown Road, now the A775. There was a tunnel at Carnbroe Iron Works and a \\"Holytown Tunnel\\" a short distance north of the present A8 road crossing.The tunnels were opened out for the widening of the line in 1854 and 1855. Nine weeks later, on 31 March 1834 the line was opened to the pits at Chapelknowe: immediately south of Holytown Road the line swerved eastwards. When other parts of the line were built later, there was a continuation south and the site became, much later, Mossend North Junction. However a passenger station called Holytown was opened there in 1844, changing its name to Mossend in 1882. Now running south-east to east, the line passed a Carfin station (renamed Holytown in 1882) and a Newarthill station (renamed Carfin in 1928). As far as this point, the route is still in operation today as Whifflet - Mossend North Jn - Holytown - Carfin, but here the original line turned south to serve several pits in the Cleland estate at Chapelknowe.Col M H Cobb, The Railways of Great Britain -- A Historical Atlas, Ian Allan Publishing Limited, Shepperton, 2003, =Coltness Estate= In 1836 Thomas Houldsworth, a Manchester entrepreneur, purchased the Coltness Estate, with its extensive mineral rights. At this time the Railway Company had run out of money to complete the building of their line. \\"In order to allow the development of his minerals, Houldsworth agreed that if the company extended their line to Coltness, for which they would require to borrow £20,000 and to get an Act allowing an extension of time for construction, he would personally guarantee the interest on the loan, and pay £300 towards the Act. He also agree to give the necessary land on the Coltness Estate free (apart from compensation to tenants) and to send all his goods by the railway, if the Company charged him the prevailing rate.\\" He also agreed to pay half of the payment to the Drysdale estate to buy out the prohibition on locomotives. =Reaching Jerviston= Wishaw and Coltness Railway system in 1845 As money became available, the next extension (actually the intended \\"main line\\") was built, about a mile long, and opening in 1838, running due south from the junction at \\"Holytown\\" (i.e. Mossend North Junction) to \\"Jerviston\\", serving several pits. The location was at the north end of the (later) Ravenscraig complex, and the route was to the east of the present Mossend - Motherwell line (opened in 1857). =On to \\"Coltness\\"= In 1841 the next section was opened, from Jerviston to Overton (now spelt Overtown). Continuing south from Jerviston and crossing the Clyde, the line turned south-east at Motherwell Junction, a little distance south-east of the present-day station there; from there the line formed the route of the present West Coast Main Line, serving coal and ironstone pits and clay pits and reaching Coltness Colliery, which was in the area between the bridges at Pather and Overtown. =To Chapel at last= In 1842 a further extension was opened, taking the line on from Coltness Colliery to Chapel Colliery—the first-named objective in Priestley's description—in the area of Morningside. This was immediately east of the Stirling Road (later A73). Passenger stations were opened in 1845 at Overtown and \\"Carluke\\"; the Carluke station was on the Stirling Road near the site of the old Law Hospital. =Morningside= The final stage in the gradual extension of the route was achieved on 9 March 1844; continuing from Chapel Colliery, the line ran the short distance to pits and a brick and tile works close to Morningside, involving a bridge over the Auchter Water.James states that this is the date when the line reached Chapel. Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway In 1845 the Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway opened its line, on 2 June. The new railway sought to connect pits further east to the developing network towards the Monklands and the Clyde, and was therefore dependent on the Wishaw and Coltness Railway. The newcomer was always short of money and never succeeded to connecting the important iron works at Wilsontown, and the Inspecting Officer for passenger operation wrote that \\"the line terminates in a large field, about a mile from a small village called Whitburn.\\"Captain J Coddington, in Report dated 11 June 1845 in Parliamentary Papers, Railway Department, Session: 22 January – 28 August 1846 The newcomer built a Morningside terminus, facing east, in the north-east angle of Mill Road and Morningside Road, and built a short connection to the Wishaw and Coltness (W&CR;) line on the west side of Morningside Road. The W&CR; promptly built its own Morningside station at that point, abutting the road, and 2 chains (44 yards, 40 m) from the WM&CR; station.Railway Clearing House, Official Railway Junction Diagrams, 1915, reprinted David & Charles (holdings) Ltd, Newton Abbot, 1969, Operation Like the other coal railways built in the same period, the railway thought of itself as analogous to a canal, where it provided a route and independent hauliers provided wagons and horses to pull them, and paid the company a toll for the privilege. In fact the original Act stipulated that \\"Owners of land may erect wharfs, warehouses and cranes on the line, and if they refuse the company may do so, charging for the use thereof [certain laid down charges]\\"Quoted in Priestley By 1838 the G&GR; was operating locomotives over the G&GR; and the W&CR.;Report of Committee of Management of Wishaw & Coltness Railway, 5 February 1838, quoted in Robertson In 1839 the company decided to adopt locomotive traction, and to reduce the multiplicity of horse traders, in order to \\"do away with the collisions which are daily taking place between the drivers\\".Report of the Committee of Management of the Wishaw and Coltness, 9 September 1839, quoted in Robertson In 1842 the company bought 323 wagons from the independent hauliers on their line to reduce the number of traders on the line and to keep down the complaints from traders that locomotives were damaging their wagons.Robert Dodds, General Remarks on the Wishaw and Coltness Railway ..., 1844, quoted in Robertson The wagons were primitive and unsprung, and when the Caledonian Railway was later negotiating to purchase the line, it was essential to be able to report that \\"new wagons with springs and entire new engines have been put on\\".Evidence by Joseph Locke to Parliamentary Select Committee, 24 April 1849, quoted in Robertson In 1843–1845, 1,057,431 tons were carried by the company, of which 61.2% were conveyed by the company itself, and the balance by independent hauliers.Parliamentary Papers, Report of the Railway Department for 1844-1845, quoted in Robertson In this period, attention was being drawn to the high proportion of operating costs: of £11,125 annual average revenue in 1839–1843, 36.9% of that figure was expended in operation. Locomotives The Wishaw and Coltness company acquired three locomotives designed by Robert Dodds and built by James M Rowan of Glasgow: they were named Wishaw, Coltness and Cleland; they started work at the end of 1840. It was reported that > When received, they were forthwith applied to the purpose of the traffic, > and they have provided the advantages to be derived on this as on the > adjoining railways from the more general employment of engines instead of > horse haulage. In all cases they have been found to be of great service to > the prosperity of the Company's revenue.Company report quoted in Paterson Passengers The Company started a passenger service to Coatbridge on 8 May 1845Paterson says 1845 but this may be a misprint; similarly the through coach to Townhead is printed as from Townhead leaving Morningside at 7.07 a.m., and calling at Stirling Road, Overtown Road, Wishaw, Motherwell, Holytown and Carnbroe Iron Works, arriving at Coatbridge at 8.50 a.m. A through coach was taken on by the Glasgow, Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway (GG&CR;) to its Townhead terminal in Glasgow, and there was a corresponding late afternoon return service. Through tickets were issued from Lanark, by omnibus to Stirling Road to connect, and the GG&CR; later developed tourism by this route, advertising the scenic beauty of the Falls of Clyde at Lanark, using a morning outward service and afternoon return. Names of the early passenger stations bear little resemblance to modern naming. From the junction at Whifflet, they were: Cleland line: * Carnbroe (or Carnbroe Iron Works), opened 1843, closed about 1846 * Holytown (located at the later Mossend North Junction); opened 1844, renamed Mossend 1882, closed 1962 * Carfin, opened in about 1834, renamed Holytown in 1882, still in operation * Newarthill (located at the present-day Carfin station); opened in 1834, closed in 1880 Coltness line: * Motherwell (located a short distance south of the present station); opened 1845, closed in 1885 when the present station opened * Flemington, opened in 1891, closed in 1965 * Shieldmuir, opened 1990 * Wishaw, opened in 1845; renamed Wishaw South in 1880 when the new line from Holytown Junction to Law Junction opened; closed in 1958 * Overtown, opened in 1845; closed in 1881 * Carluke (located a considerable distance from the present Carluke station); opened 1845, renamed Stirling Road, Morningside in 1848; closed in 1853 * Morningside, opened in 1845, closed in 1930 The Morningside line became a minor branch off the West Coast Main Line when the Caledonian Railway took over the Company, and the passenger service probably ceased in 1853. When the Caledonian Railway built a new line via Newmains, it approached Morningside from the north and a passenger service from Holytown terminated there. In 1895 and in 1922 there were five trains each way with one extra on Saturdays. The Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness Railway operated a service from its own Morningside station, 40 m away by rail, heading east to Bathgate. There was not much co-ordination of train times, and the 40 m of railway between the two stations did not have a passenger service.Bradshaw's General Steam Navigation and Railway Guide, 12th mo, (December) 1895, reprinted by Middleton Press, Midhurst, 2011, Bradshaw's General Railway and Steam Navigation Guide, 7th mo, (July) 1922, reprinted by Guild Publishing, London, 1985 Wider horizons The line was built as a coal railway, with the primary object of conveying the mineral to market in central Scotland. The industrial processes developed rapidly during the first decade of the line's existence, so did the demand for efficient transport. As the Coltness Iron Works and other industries developed, they needed to bring in materials from further afield, and to dispatch their products to far-off destinations. In common with the other \\"coal railways\\" the technical limitations of the little railway became more obvious, and the most important of these was the track gauge of 4 ft 6 in, which required transshipment of loads at the point of connection with standard gauge lines. In 1847, the railway changed its gauge to the standard 4 ft 8½ in. The Caledonian Railway was being promoted about the same time, with the object of participating in forming a main line route between Central Scotland and Carlisle, connecting there with the English railway trunk network. At the time the Grand Junction Railway was planning an approach from the south to Carlisle. The Caledonian Railway promoters planned an entry through Annandale. To get access to Glasgow, the Caledonian secured agreement from the Wishaw and Coltness Railway and the Glasgow Garnkirk and Coatbridge Railway to use their lines for the approach to the city. The Caledonian took a lease of the Wishaw and Coltness from 1 January 1847, guaranteeing 10.5% on the W&C; capitalisation of £240,000. (Agreement to lease the GG&CR; had been obtained a year earlier at 8%.)David Ross, The Caledonian: Scotland's Imperial Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, For the time being the Caledonian used the GG&CR; Townhead terminus in Glasgow, but soon extended to a new terminal at Glasgow, Buchanan Street. Parts of the Wishaw and Coltness routes remain in use at the present day: the section from the original Motherwell station, just south-east of the present-day station, to Garriongill Junction, and the section from Whifflet to Mossend South Junction follows the original construction.

This campanile is the tallest all-granite structure in the United States and is part of the Provincetown Historic District. In 1620, the Pilgrims spent five weeks exploring Cape Cod before they sailed to Plymouth, Massachusetts. After spending weeks at sea, the Pilgrims resolved not to set foot on land until the Mayflower Compact was written and signed. A contest was held to design a structure to commemorate the Pilgrims' landing, and over 150 entries were submitted. The winning design, by Boston architect Willard T. Sears, was based upon the Torre del Mangia in Siena, Italy, designed by Agostino and Agnolo da Siena in 1309. On August 20, 1907, Theodore Roosevelt lays the cornerstone of the Pilgrim Monument. In a ceremony on August 20, 1907, President Theodore Roosevelt officiated at the laying of the cornerstone. After the monument's completion, President William H. Taft dedicated it at a ceremony held on August 5, 1910. Pilgrim Monument The design was controversial because of its lack of any obvious relevance to the Pilgrim Fathers.

The fire tower is made of brick like the Italian original, was built in 1892 by Edmund March Wheelwright, is tall, was originally designed as part of the central fire station and used as a fire lookout, and later became part of the Pine Street Inn, a shelter for Boston's homeless.Ralli, Tania (2005), \\"And Now A Word From Our Shelter: Ads Atop Pine Street Inn Help Pay To Restore It, But Some Ask Where It Will End\\", The Boston Globe, October 9, 2005, p. 1Pine Street Inn (Boston) - Wikimapia However, The Boston Globe noted that \\"The people of Provincetown are not at all enthusiastic about the design, but are glad enough to get almost any sort of monument,\\" and quoted \\"an old sea captain\\" as saying: \\"I don't sympathize with all the kicking about the monument. It's good enough, and it has this in its favor, that it resembles many lighthouses on the coast of Portugal and on Portuguese Islands, and Provincetown, you know, is full of Portuguese.\\"\\"Most Imposing Monument On The Atlantic Coast,\\" The Boston Globe, August 18, 1907, p. SM12 Tourists from around the world visit Provincetown to climb the monument and view the Provincetown Museum at its base. The monument commemorates the Pilgrims, and the museum pays tribute to Provincetown's vibrant and historic maritime past. Provincetown residents take great pride in the structure. Christmas lights are strung from the top of the monument to its base annually and are lit in November to much fanfare. It remains lit nightly into January. According to Edmund J. Carpenter in his book The Pilgrims and their Monument (self- published in 1911), the total expenditures in the planning and construction of the monument were $91,252.82,Carpenter, Edmund J., The Pilgrims and their Monument (Cambridge, MA: Privately printed, 1911), 265. .

Playing career Craig Maskell began his professional football career at Southampton where he'd previously signed as an apprentice. After playing a handful of games for the club, he was loaned to Swindon Town before his eventual transfer to Huddersfield Town. A prolific goalscorer for the team, Maskell was later included in The Fans' Favourites, a book which lists the 100 Huddersfield Town players voted by the fans as their favourite players at the time of their centennial in 2008. A spell at Reading was followed by his move to Swindon Town, under Glenn Hoddle; he scored at Wembley in the 1993 Division One Play- off Final to promote Swindon to the Premier League. Following a poor season with the club in 1993–94, when they were relegated from the Premier League with only five wins all season, he was sold back to Southampton for £250,000, but his return to The Dell was not a success. He managed 17 Premier League appearances in two seasons, scoring just once, and unable to break up the three-man attack of Matthew Le Tissier, Neil Shipperley and Gordon Watson. He also faced competition for a place on the bench from the likes of Ronnie Ekelund and Neil Heaney. He then played for Bristol City, Brighton and Hong Kong teams Happy Valley AA before arriving at Leyton Orient. His role at Brighton was distinguished by a shot that curled around the keeper and hit the post for Robbie Reinelt to score the rebound goal against Hereford that kept the Albion in the Football League. His 18 months at Orient ended when, as part of the losing team in the 1999 Division Three play-off final, he walked off the pitch at the end of the game vowing never to play for the team again. \\"I turned to one of my team-mates and said 'that's enough', I'd spent too much time away from my family and too little time on the pitch at Orient.\\" Leyton Orient released him at the start of the 1999–00 season and he became assistant coach under manager Steve Cordery at Hampton & Richmond Borough. Maskell was leading goalscorer for the team at the end of the 1999–00 season and had helped the Isthmian League Premier Division club to reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time. Maskell and Cordery moved to Aylesbury in Summer 2002 and he was again amongst the Premier Division's top marksmen with 26 league and cup goals for the team. The pair took over at Staines Town in 2003, where they continued to play and manage the team until April 2012.

Waddell is named after Donald Ware Waddell, native of Ohio, who was a partner in the New York City investment firm of Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. It was this firm that organized the private financing for construction of the dam for the water reclamation project that creates Lake Pleasant. The intended Waddell town site was laid out by Donald W. Waddell in 1935, on property he owned on the northeast corner of Waddell Road and Cotton Lane (Section 12, T3N, R2W, G&SRB;&M;). Waddell moved to the area to oversee the firm's interests in the project. He served on the board of the Maricopa Water District and invested in land through his interests in the Arizona Citrus Land Company and the Waddell Ranch Company. In 1937 the Waddell Post Office was established inside the store on the original town site. Later the post office moved across the street and shared space with the cotton gin office. The current Waddell Post Office was built in 1992 and is located on Glendale Avenue and Cotton Lane, four miles south of the original site. The town never did develop, but remained a post office and place name for the area. The dam on the Agua Fria River that creates Lake Pleasant (once called Frog Tanks Dam then, Pleasant Dam) was renamed for Donald W. Waddell in 1963, shortly after his death, in recognition of his contributions to the Maricopa Water District. Barry M. Goldwater spoke at the dedication ceremony. With the expansion of the city of Surprise, use of the name Waddell to describe the location is rapidly falling into disuse. Influence of the name can still be seen in the name of Waddell Road, an arterial street running through Surprise, as well as the New Waddell Dam at Lake Pleasant. In November 2010 the White Tank Regional Library opened.http://www.librarytechnology.org/lwc-displaylibrary.pl?RC=41526 The community contains the Wat Promkunaram Buddhist Temple. This facility was the site of a mass shooting in 1991 which left nine people dead, among them monks and temple helpers. It remains the deadliest homicide incident in Arizona history since statehood. Sixteen-year-old Alessandro Garcia and 17-year-old Jonathan Doody were charged with the crime, convicted, and sentenced. Doody was tried three times and sentenced to 281 years of prison in 2014.

Life Philothei was born as Revoula Benizelou in Athens on November 21, 1522 to an illustrious and wealthy family. Her parents were Angelos Benizelos and Syrigi Palaiologina, both from old Byzantine families. They had no children, but after fervent prayer her mother gave birth to a daughter whom they named Revoula, her birth name. Against her will, she was married at the age of 14 to the noble Andrea Chila, who mistreated her. When he died in 1539, she was only 17, beautiful and wealthy and her parents insisted that she get remarried. Instead, she remained at home, spending much of her time in prayer. The family wealth gave her the opportunity for charitable work, and while still a young woman she had gained the respect and love of the community. When her parents died in 1549, Philothei found herself the owner of extensive holdings. She took up the monastic life and around 1551, establishing a women's monastery under the patronage of St. Andrew. She took the name Philothei.\\"Saint Philothei the Righteous Martyr of Athens\\", Greek Orthodox Metropolis of Toronto There the young nuns taught handiwork, weaving, housekeeping and cooking. In this way, she prepared the young women who came to her for the domestic life. Philothei is primarily remembered for her abundant philanthropy. The convent had a great deal of charity establishments both in Athens and on the islands of the Aegean sea. Philothei founded a second, more secluded monastery at Patesia. She also built hospices, homes for the elderly, and schools for the girls and boys of Athens. One of her more controversial activities was to buy the freedom of Greeks taken as slaves by the Ottoman Turks, especially women taken to the harems. She offered shelter to the young women, some pregnant. Despite being hunted by the Turks, she helped them escape secretly to Tzia, Andros, Aegina and Salamina, where they were safe.\\"St. Philothei of Athens 1522-1589\\", Pemptousia, 2 November 2011 In a 22 February 1583 letter to the Venetian Gerousia, Philothei asked for monetary support to pay off her debts from ransom money, duties, bribes, and taxes that she owed to the occupying Turks. Her monasteries were frequently plundered, and the farming and agricultural program, which were a basic source of sustaining her work, devastated. Four women enslaved by the Ottoman Turks in harems also ran to her for refuge. The women were traced, and Philothei was beaten and brought before the magistrate who put her in prison. Friends intervened and paid the district governor for her release. As her fame grew, so did the animosity against her. On 3 October 1588, four Ottoman mercenaries broke into the monastery at Patesia during the evening vigil service and beat her severely. She remained bedridden and died of her injuries on 19 February 1589. St Philothei house/Benizelos mansion The bay window at the south facade of Benizelos mansion. The mansion of St Philothei locates in Plaka and is probably the oldest house in Athens. () Veneration The shrine of Saint Filothei Philothei is considered a martyr by the Eastern Orthodox Church. Just a few years after her death, she was canonized a Saint, in the days of the Ecumenical Patriarch Matthew the Second (1595-1600). Her memory is venerated on February 19. Along with Saints Hierotheus and Dionysius the Areopagite, Saint Philothei is considered a patron of the city of Athens. Her relics are interred in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Athens. The Filothei district of Athens is named after her. Saint Philothei has a Troparion written about her: Troparion to St. Philothei (Tone 5) The Faithful of Athens and all the world honor Philothei the martyred nun and rejoice in her holy relics.

Impalement arts are a type of performing art in which a performer plays the role of human target for a fellow performer who demonstrates accuracy skills in disciplines such as knife throwing and archery. Impalement is actually what the performers endeavor to avoid – the thrower or marksman aims near the target rather than at him or her. The objective is to land the throw or shot as close as possible to the assistant's body without causing injury. Impalement arts are often found in circuses and sideshows as well as sometimes in variety, cabaret or burlesque shows. In addition, impalement acts have provided subject matter for literature, art, photography and film and television scripts. There are important distinctions between knife throwing or archery practiced as competitive sports and similar skills displayed as impalement arts. For example, organizing bodies for competitive archery prohibit activity that involves deliberate shooting in the general direction of a human being.For example, impalement arts contravene rules 101(b) and 102(a) of the UK Grand National Archery Society (GNAS) Rules of Shooting (see ) and represent \\"substantial\\" or \\"intolerable\\" risk under GNAS Archery range health and safety policy (see ) History The precise origins of the impalement arts remain unknown, but its performance may reach back as far as antiquity. The Roman emperor Domitian (1st century AD) was said to entertain guests on his Alban estate with virtuoso displays of marksmanship.Suetonius, Life of Domitian 19 The historian Suetonius reported these acts in his biography of the emperor: Knife throwing performers are known to have performed in Europe and America in the 19th century,Stanley Brion in the foreword to A Day on Broadway, p.vii with recorded uses of the term \\"impalement\\" to describe this type of act as early as 1871. (excerpts published on the internet by the Circus Historical Society) The growth of the impalement arts was greatly facilitated by the way that circus developed in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and in particular by American influences. Buffalo Bill's performances in Europe in 1887 resulted in a wave of popularity for Wild West shows and the \\"western arts\\" they involved, including knife throwing, archery, whip cracking and sharp shooting.Brion, A Day on Broadway, p.viii In the circus world, the success of large-scale tented touring shows pioneered in America led to the introduction of more acts of skill and daring as well as the inclusion of sideshows, in which impalement acts sometimes featured. Among the most significant events were Barnum & Bailey's tours of Europe from 1897 to 1902, which made a huge impact on European circus owners and led them to adopt similar formats. As well as providing a friendly stage where impalement acts could rely on finding an audience, circus was a competitive environment in which shows and performers sought to out do each other and thus there were incentives to develop new stunts. Moving targets were an innovation used by European artists in the 1930s. A notable example is the Wheel of Death, which is recorded as having been introduced into the US in 1938 by The Gibsons, from Germany.ibid. p.ix Another trend in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that acts from circuses began to find work in permanent venues that were developing in rapidly growing towns and cities. In the US they found a place in vaudeville and burlesque shows. In Britain the equivalent was music hall. And in both America and Europe, cabaret was another format that sometimes embraced impalement artists. The advent of cinema and later television in the 20th century eventually led to a gradual decline in the venues in which the impalement arts had previously thrived, but a new home was created in the form of television variety shows. A knife throwing act was one of the first pieces of entertainment ever broadcast on television. When the BBC started the world's first practical television service with experimental transmissions in 1936 one of the types of programmes it produced were variety shows with circus artists. Those acts, which included the knife throwing Denvers, were thought to be very visual and thus suited to the new medium. Variety later became an important part of primetime schedules and remained so for decades. Although television variety shows are no longer the central feature of network television that they once were, the acts they harboured have found new outlets. The impalement arts live on in modern versions of circus and burlesque and still manage to find an occasional broadcast showcase. An example of this is the recent trend for talent competitions styled on a \\"reality TV\\" format, such as America's Got Talent, which featured knifethrowing in its 2007 run. Forms and variations The human target is the essential distinguishing feature of the impalement arts. It has been asserted by several sources, including well-known knife throwers, that the power and appeal of this type of act lies as much in audience appreciation of the target as in admiration of the skill of the thrower or archer.For example, Dr David Adamovich, aka The Great Throwdini, has frequently asserted the importance of his assistants in print and in web forums. In Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway: The art of being a knife thrower's assistant, Turnshare (London, 2005), , p.150, he writes of: \\"...my lovely and daring assistants - sine qua non - without which there'd be no act!\\". In the same book Astrid Schollenberger describes her initial instruction by Adamovich thus: \\"Rule one: The target girl is the star of the show and she has to be aware that the stunts depend on her. Rule two: You must not move\\". Various theories have been put forward to explain this, ranging from simple awe at the display of steely nerves and complete trust to more complex psychological and philosophical theories. While some point to overtones of sadomasochistic eroticism, others cite dramaturgical works and point to parallels with the story arc of the hero in classic drama. In particular the assistant's performance is said to mirror the plot device of the hero's ordeal, in which the hero proves his or her heroic qualities through self-sacrifice or by facing extreme peril.Dr Joachim Heil PhD, \\"A short philosophical essay on the art of knife throwing\\", in Adamovich, Heil & Schollenberger, A Day on Broadway, pp.83–114Extensive evidence of the debate on this topic is to be found in various online forums including the Dangerous Circus Acts groups on Yahoo! The target or assistant role is most often taken by a female performer, sometimes known as a target girl, who commonly wears a revealing costume, thus adding an element of overt sexuality to the act. While a few contemporary acts feature a male in the target role, and some play upon role reversal, the traditional figure of a female target still prevails.Stanley Brion in the foreword to A Day on Broadway, p.x Generally speaking, the assistant, whether male or female, stands in front of a board, made of wood or some similar material, into which the knives or arrows are embedded. For some stunts the assistant is strapped to a moving board. There are several disciplines and a great variety of tricks and stunts that are performed within this basic format. Some tricks are done by performers in all disciplines while others are generally the preserve of one discipline. For example, moving target stunts, such as the \\"wheel of death\\", tend to be done by knife throwers but not by archers. Impalement artists have adopted a variety of guises, including Wild West figures, \\"gypsy\\" characters or tuxedo- wearing cabaret performers. There have even been efforts to package impalement arts within dramatic productions, such as the play Pin Cushion, which consists of a monologue delivered by an actress as she takes part in a real knifethrowing act (see Theatre).For official website see For review see For images see =Disciplines= The impalement arts can be divided into distinct disciplines. While some performers specialise purely in one of the disciplines, others combine disciplines or even mix impalement arts into other types of performance. * Knife throwing is the most common and well-known discipline within the impalement arts. It includes the throwing of axes, machetes and other sharp implements as well as knives. * Archery is the other main discipline. An archer might use bows or crossbows or both. * Sharpshooting: It is arguable that some firearms sharpshooting acts fall into the category of impalement arts when they involve a performer holding up targets for a marksman. Even when sharpshooting is not performed as an impalement art, it is sometimes grouped alongside knife throwing as a Wild West art. It also has much in common with crossbow shooting in terms of the accuracy skills involved. * Whips and other disciplines: Disciplines such as bullwhip displays and trick roping are not strictly impalement arts but are often grouped with impalement art disciplines for a variety of reasons. Bullwhip artists and ropers sometimes employ human \\"targets\\" for certain tricks. Furthermore, some impalement arts performers also feature these other disciplines in their acts. In addition, all the above disciplines are sometimes placed within a common context, such as Wild West arts. =Tricks= There are many variations on the simple arrangement of having the assistant stand in front of a target board and remain still while knives, arrows or other objects land about them. Often the first type of variation in a routine is that the assistant will assume different poses. For example: * Profile: This is a classic done by many performers. The assistant stands side-on to the board and then bends backwards. The impalement artist then aims a series of knives, axes or arrows along the line of the front edge of the assistant, beginning around the legs and ending with the last throw or shot coming close to the assistant's throat. One aspect of this pose is that it accentuates the vulnerability of the assistant, particularly with the last impact tantalisingly close to the throat. Another important aspect for knifethrowers is that the upper part of the assistant's body is positioned so that a series of throws can be landed above it - a flexible target girl might be able to place her neck and the upper part of her chest in a horizontal line. A skilled thrower can use the way that a knife turns in flight to land it sloping at a downward angle from the board; thus, the point of the knife can impact safely above the assistant but the rest of the knife can slope down and come very close indeed to the assistant's body, even making contact on some occasions. * Headstand: An example from the repertoire of knife acts goes as follows: The assistant does a headstand against the target board; the thrower then throws two knives or axes, one into each of the two top corners of the target board; the assistant moves his or her legs apart until they touch the two implements embedded in the board; the thrower then throws a series of implements into the \\"V\\" formed by the assistants legs, progressing threateningly towards the crotch. More complex stunts and challenges include: * The Wheel of death: One of the most difficult and dangerous feats for a knifethrower. The assistant is strapped to a large circular target board which spins about its middle, like a wheel. The thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on the segments of the wheel not covered by the assistant's body. There are some variations in the exact configuration of \\"wheels\\": in some the assistant is positioned with their arms at their sides while in others the assistant is spreadeagled. Sometimes the \\"wheel\\" might not actually be circular: shield shapes and rectangular rotating boards have been known and all will work as \\"wheels\\" as long as they are correctly balanced to rotate smoothly when the assistant is in place. A particularly challenging version of this stunt is \\"The Veiled Wheel\\", in which the target is covered with a paper screen so the thrower can't see the assistant. Only four artists are known to have attempted this dangerous trick. It was first performed by The Gibsons in the 1930s; a duo named The Zeros followed them in the 1940s, Fritz Brumbach did it in Monte Carlo in 1978 and The Great Throwdini revived it in New York in October 2010 with Melissa-Anne Ainley acting as his target girl. * The Devil's door: A moving target challenge pioneered by knifethrower Larry Cisewski. This time the assistant is on a door-sized rectangular board that spins about a central vertical axis. Again the thrower must execute a series of rapid, consistent and carefully timed throws to land knives on parts of the board not covered by the assistant's body. Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives down the sides of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them. * Balloon bursting: The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds balloons which the thrower or archer then attempts to burst. Balloons can be held in the hand, positioned under arms or between the legs and sometimes an assistant will hold a balloon between their teeth. * William Tell: There are various stunts inspired by the story of William Tell, who, according to legend, was forced to shoot an apple off of his son's head with a crossbow. Modern impalement artists have performed similar feats. In some ways the Tell legend can be seen as one of the earliest inspirations for the impalement arts. * Impaling a card or paper plate: The assistant stands in front of the target board and holds out a card, or paper plate which the thrower or archer attempts to pin to the board. The level of danger can be varied to some extent by whether the assistant holds the card at full arms length or keeps it close. The Jasters do a \\"William Tell\\" version in which the card is balanced on the head of target girl Elena Busnelli. * Cutting a straw or flower stem: An assistant holds a straw or flower in his or her mouth and the impalement artist attempts to chop the tip of it off. This is mostly associated with knife throwers and bullwhip artists. * Blind: The thrower or archer wears a blindfold. Generally the assistant first guides the blindfolded impalement artist into position facing towards the target board. The assistant then stands in place against the board and gives an audible signal to commence the stunt. The implication is that the impalement artist then has to aim on the basis of where they remember the target to be. There is a trick behind this stunt and budding impalement artists are warned not to attempt it unless coached by an experienced professional. * Covered target: The assistant is covered so that the thrower or archer cannot see exactly where they are. The covering is made of paper or some other flimsy material so that knives or arrows will pass through it. The implication is that the thrower or archer must estimate the position of the assistant using memory and other indirect guides and aim on that basis. * Double ladder of death: This involves two knifethrowers simultaneously performing a rapid sequence of throws at the same target board while aiming so that the trajectories of their knives cross. The throwers stand side by side facing the assistant at the board. The knives from the thrower on the right land on the left side of the target board while the knives from the thrower on the left impact to the right. Each thrower aims their next knife vertically above where they placed the preceding one, so that a ladder of knives is formed up each side of the assistant. This stunt was pioneered by The Great Throwdini in partnership with Harry Munroe. * Vegetable slice: A cucumber (or similar vegetable) is held on the bare skin of the assistant's body (usually the inside of her forearm). A series of knives are thrown around the assistant, ending with a knife that slices the cucumber in half. This stunt was performed by Jack Dagger on History Channel's More Extreme Marksmen and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Myths Astrid Schollenberger in rehearsal faces the knives for real. One is captured in flight, fractions of a second before impact. It is occasionally alleged that knife throwing acts are actually a trick in which the thrower palms the knife as he pretends to throw it and a knife springs out from the target, giving the illusion of perfect aim. Although this technique has been used by at least one magician to emulate knife throwing, the great majority of knife throwers perform genuine acts.A magician who demonstrated the fake knives trick was Val Valentino in the TV series Breaking the Magicians' Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed . See also knife throwing. There are secret tricks behind certain stunts, such as throwing while blindfolded, but they do not involve fake knives springing from the target board. Injuries suffered by performers provide evidence of the genuine nature of the impalement acts in question. Examples include the cases of Yana Rodionova, injured in a televised stunt with knife thrower Jayde Hanson, and French target girl Catherine Jamet, of Duo Grey Arrow, who suffered a near fatal wound during a crossbow act at the World Circus Festival in Paris in 2001. Testimonials to the genuineness of knife acts are also to be found in the autobiographical writings of several former target girls.Testimonials include actress Ronnie Claire Edwards, Notable artists The impalement arts have evolved as the product of a history of performance dating back to at least the 19th century. That heritage, and especially the collective achievements of notable performers, helps to define the subject. As with other performance arts, judgements about who might be the most notable are highly subjective and clouded by the hyperbole of publicity. For similar reasons it is also sometimes difficult to resolve debates about who originated particular stunts. Nevertheless, some names recur frequently in historical records and current news. Some are recognised for pioneering achievements, some for bringing the arts to widespread audiences and some as distinctive characters who, although less famous, have had significant influence on their peers. Because this is not a league table of merit and because overlaps make a chronological presentation awkward, they are presented here in alphabetic order under the two main disciplines. =Knife throwing= * Sylvester and Barbara Braun - This husband and wife began performing their \\"Wizards of the West\\" act in the early 1940s. Sixty years later they were honoured by the International Knifethrowers Hall of Fame with the \\"Knife Throwing Pioneer Award\\" and the title \\"Wild West Duo of the 20th Century\\". * The Brumbachs/Los Alamos - A renowned German family act now in its second generation. They began with Fritz Brumbach as thrower and his wife Helga as target girl. Later daughter Sylvia joined the act as a second target girl and then son Patrick became a thrower. They have made many television appearances. Fritz appeared on Circus of the Stars in 1986 with Britt Ekland as his target girl. Fritz and Helga have since retired but Patrick and Sylvia continue the act.

These representations, rather than real acts, will have provided many people with the main basis of their ideas about the impalement arts. Impalement acts have proved to be useful plot devices and have provided iconic images. The following sections provide some examples by way of illustration. =Movies and television= Perhaps the most notable movie example is the French film Girl on the Bridge (1999), in which a knife throwing act is at the centre of the plot and serves as a powerful erotic metaphor. Vanessa Paradis stars as Adele, a girl who attempts suicide by jumping from a bridge but is saved by knife thrower Gabor, played by Daniel Auteuil, who persuades her to become his target girl. Other examples include: * In episode six of American Horror Story: Freak Show, \\"Bullseye\\" (November 2014), character Elsa Mars (Jessica Lange) throws knives at Paul 'The Illustrated Seal' (Mat Fraser) as he spins on a wheel of death. * The fourth season of the television series Bones, featured an episode (first aired in 2009) in which title character Temperance \\"Bones\\" Brennan goes undercover as a target girl with Special Agent Seeley Booth as a knife-thrower. * The film Gangs of New York (2002) features a confrontation between the main protagonists in which Cameron Diaz's character Jenny Everdeane acts as a target girl in an impromptu knifethrowing act with the villain, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, played by Daniel Day-Lewis. * In the television series Nikki, the episode titled \\"The Jupiter and Mary Chain\\", first aired in 2001, featured the characters played by Nikki Cox and Susan Egan taking jobs as target girls. * The television play The Act (1987) revolved around a knife throwing act.

It is hinted that he might do this by feigning an accident while she acts as his target girl. The twist is that he finds this impossible because he has trained himself so well that his reflexes prevent it. * The relationship between a target girl and a circus knifethrower is the central motif in the poem cycle Das Mädchen und der Messerwerfer published in 1997 by noted German poet Wolf Wondratschek. =Art (including photography)= * Model Karen Elson is seen spinning on a \\"wheel of death\\" target in a picture by photographer Steven Meisel that formed part of a series titled \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" in the April 2007 issue of the Italian edition of Vogue magazine. * Model Kate Moss appeared on a \\"wheel of death\\" target in two of a series of fashion photos by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott in the April 2006 issue of W magazine. * Actress Jennifer Ellison appeared strapped to a \\"wheel of death\\" target and surrounded by knives in the UK edition of Maxim magazine in 2005.

The school had around 1,200 students on roll from ages 11 to 18. The school was replaced with Swallow Hill Community College in 2009, following the merger between two local schools. After 102 years West Leeds High School closed and replaced by Swallow Hill. History The school served the Armley, Bramley and Wortley areas of Leeds for 100 years. =Grammar school= The West Leeds High School opened on 7 September 1907 to improve standards in the city. The school was effectively two schools in one as both Girls and Boys were kept completely separate from each other. In September 1930, following a knock on the knee in the gymnasium on a vaulting horse, Oswald Harland, the 10-year-old son of a master, died of pyaemia in Leeds General Infirmary. By the 1950s the schools were known as West Leeds High School for Boys, with 500 boys, and West Leeds High School for Girls, with 450 girls. They were administered by the City of Leeds Education Committee. In 1959 the Girls School moved to a new campus and formed West Leeds Girls' High School on the Congress Mount Campus, with 550 girls. The Boys' school remained at the Tong Road Campus and formed West Leeds Boys' High School on Whingate, with 550 boys. =Comprehensive= The schools retained their name as 13–18 ages comprehensives. In 1993 the two schools merged to form West Leeds High School. The Congress Mount Campus was expanded in 1999 to become the size it is today. The boys' campus was sold off and converted to 66 apartments by North British Houseing and renamed as 'Old School Lofts'. The School also merged with Benjamin Gott High School, as that school had failing results and a falling pupil roll. In 2004 the School successfully applied for Technology Status and became West Leeds High School Specialist Technology College. The School renovated some classrooms and fitted new SmartBoard software. Performance The school increased its A*-C GCSE examination results from 19% in 2000 to 39% in 2006. Closure School Buildings Being Demolished In 2006 the school was informed that it would be merging with another local school, Wortley High School, to form a new school because of the falling birth rate in the local area. Both schools opposed the merger saying that this would create more disadvantages than benefits. The merger was approved and construction of the new school began in 2008 on the West Leeds High School site, named, in May 2008, Swallow Hill Community College. In September 2009, After the new school was completed, the West Leeds buildings were closed. In October 2009 the school buildings began to be demolished to be replaced with sports fields for the new school. However the original 1907 school still stands, a listed building on Whingate where it was converted into apartments. Former teachers John Wishart (statistician), known for the Wishart distribution, taught mathematics from 1922–4.

Wajda also directed \\"Wesele\\" for the theatre. \\"Wesele\\" is a defining work of Polish drama written at the turn of the 20th century. It describes the perils of the national drive toward self-determination after the Polish uprisings of November 1830 and January 1863, the result of the Partitions of Poland. It also refers to the Galician slaughter of 1846. The plot is set at the wedding of a member of Kraków intelligentsia (the Bridegroom, played by Daniel Olbrychski), and his peasant Bride (played by Ewa Ziętek). Their class-blurring union follows a fashionable trend among friends of the playwright from the modernist Young Poland movement. The play by Wyspiański was based on a real-life event: the wedding of Lucjan Rydel at the St. Mary's Basilica in Kraków and his wedding reception in the village of Bronowice. It was inspired in part also by the modernist painting of Jacek Malczewski and Maksymilian Gierymski. Plot summary A poet marries a peasant girl in Kraków. Their wedding reception follows. The celebration of the new marriage moves on from the city to the villager's house. In the rooms adjoining that of the wedding party, guests continually burst into arguments, make love, or simply rest from their merriment, dancing and feasting. Interspersed with the real guests are the well-known figures of Polish history and culture, who represent the guilty consciences of the characters. The two groups gradually begin a series of dialogues. The Poet (played by Andrzej Łapicki) is visited successively by the Black Knight, a symbol of the nation's past military glory; the Journalist (played by Wojciech Pszoniak), then by the court jester and conservative political sage Stańczyk; and the Ghost of Wernyhora (Marek Walczewski), a paradigm of leadership for Poland. Wernyhora presents the Host with a golden horn symbolizing the national mission, and calls the Polish people to a revolt.

It is based on the crimes of Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.  Plot  As a child, Wisconsinite Ed Gein is subjected to physical and psychological abuse at the hands of his religious fanatic mother, Augusta, and his alcoholic father, George. A year after his father dies, Ed goes out hunting with his older brother, Henry, and the two get into an argument over Henry wanting to leave home and Ed's devotion to Augusta. When Henry insults their mother, Ed flies into a rage and buttstrokes him; regaining his senses as Henry collapses, Ed panics and sets a fire, which Henry's \\"accidental\\" death is blamed on. Augusta later dies of a stroke, leaving Ed alone in their desolate Plainfield farm, which a despondent Ed allows to fall into a state of disrepair, with the exception of his mother's room, which Ed seals off. Living off of agricultural subsidies and the money that he makes from leasing land and babysitting neighborhood children, the increasingly unstable Ed spends his plentiful free time making nightly excursions into local cemeteries. Ed digs up the bodies of recently deceased elderly women, who he makes futile attempts at reviving before decorating parts of his home with pieces of them. The townspeople notice how perturbed Ed seems, but regard him as nothing more than a harmless eccentric with a morbid sense of humor and an obsession with graphic literature about crime, headhunting cannibal tribes, and Nazism. Ed begins suffering from hallucinations of Augusta, who he believes is contacting him from beyond the grave, commanding him to resurrect her and do the Lord's work by murdering sinful women. Ed's first victim is a local tavern owner, Mary Hogan, who he wounds with a handgun before bringing her to his home, where he leaves her bound to a bed. Days pass before Mary succumbs to her injury, at which point Ed mutilates and eats her remains, using what is left over to add to a female \\"flesh suit\\" that he has been constructing. Ed's delusions subsequently worsen, and he becomes convinced that Mary's death has brought back Augusta. A hallucination of Augusta eventually implores Ed to murder Collette Marshall, a hardware store owner who Ed had been unsuccessfully trying to woo. Ed reluctantly shoots Collette and transports her body to his house before having dinner with the Hills, a neighboring family who he surprises with \\"Venison steaks.\\" Collette's employee, Brian, returns from a hunting trip and calls the police after finding the shop full of blood. Brian becomes convinced that Ed, whose behavior towards both Mary and Collette he had always found unnerving, is responsible for the women's disappearances. Brian rushes to Ed's home, where he unearths Collette's freshly decapitated and \\"dressed out\\" body. Wanting to avenge his friends' deaths, Brian tracks Ed down to the Hill residence, but is talked out of shooting him by Sheriff Stillwell, who arrests Ed. The film ends with a nonlinear montage that consists of officers uncovering evidence in Ed's home, interviews with Ed after he was placed in a psychiatric hospital, and scenes in which Ed tries to keep his urges in check through prayer and rituals, and others in which he exhumes corpses, only to rebury them after snapping out of a Fugue state. An intertitle then states that Ed was buried next to his mother after dying of respiratory failure in 1984.

On April 22, 2003 it was re-released by First Look as a part of its three-disk box set, which included Dahmer, and Ted Bundy. Also that same day, it was also released as a single-feature by Velocity Home Entertainment. It was last released in 2005 by both Prism and First Look on February 14, and August 26 respectively.  Reception  On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 10% based on , with a weighted average rating of 4.1/10. Neil Smith of the BBC called the film \\"gross and repellent\\" and awarded it a score of 2/5, writing, \\"Parello's stated intention is to explore the psychology of his twisted protagonist, but the result has all the hallmarks of a low-budget exploitationer, right down to its B movie leads Steve Railsback and Carrie Snodgress. Would it be too much to expect some thought or consideration for Gein's victims? Evidently so, given Hollywood's depressing habit of turning serial killers into cult heroes.\\" While The Guardian's Philip French offered praise to Railsback's performance as Gein, he found the film itself to be \\"a generally unsensational chunk of bizarre Americana\\" that \\"adds little to our understanding of the man.\\" Fellow Guardian reviewer Peter Bradshaw had a similar response to the film, writing, \\"Really, it's the same old pulpy, paranoid voyeuristic stuff, and Ed's fear and hatred of women is never that edifying. It's well acted, and effectively put together, but there is an insurmountable problem: gloomy, grave-robbing, body-chopping old Ed is, in the end, just a little bit of a bore.\\" Variety's Robert Koehler gave the film a negative review, deriding the film as being both lackluster and \\"a disappointingly mild re-creation of true events\\". While Steven T. Boltz of PopMatters enjoyed Railsback's acting and the film's historical accuracy, he was critical of its occasional lapses into sensationalism and of its inconsistent characterization of Gein, and ended his review of the picture with, \\"Is Ed Gein an attempt to bring the true story to light? I can't say. Did it? Well, yes and no. It's really a moot point. The question I guess you have to ask yourself is this: Are you watching for historical accuracy or for entertainment?\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times afforded the film moderate praise, commending the performances, its atmosphere, and its historical accuracy, but went on to write, \\"Ed Gein resists cheap humor in favor of moments that are inherently darkly comic, and tries for a seriousness of purpose, yet is at times awkward and under-inspired, creating a question as to whether so gloomy and repugnant a tale was worth telling simply for its own sake.\\" Ain't It Cool News also praised Railsback's performance, and concluded, \\"Ed Gein is not must-see but it's a lot better than I thought it would be. I would recommend a rental to the curious horror or true crime fans out there looking for something sort of along the lines of Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, but tamer, but at the same time a lot sicker.\\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club had a lukewarm reaction to the film, writing, \\"Half character study, half exploitation film, Ed Gein is most effective when it focuses on Gein's halting attempts to connect with his neighbors, who treat him with the polite but decided distance of an adult dealing with a misbehaving but well- intentioned child. Where the film falters is in its attempts to explain away Gein's madness with a massive dose of pop psychology.\\" Time Out found the film to be \\"a surprisingly sober response to a potentially salacious subject\\" and wrote, \\"As with the best scenes of Deranged, the conjunction of colourful case history, odd impulses, gallows humour, low budget austerity and genuinely grotesque iconography produces a felicitous and engaging variant of American Gothic.\\" Richard Gilliam from Allmovie felt that \\"Parello doesn't understand that credibility is not a substitute for style\\", but also commended the film's historical accuracy, and low-key approach to the material. = Awards = Steve Railsback and Chuck Parello won Best Actor and Best Film, respectively, at the 2000 Sitges Film Festival, while Railsback and Sally Champlin won Best Actor and Best Actress, respectively, at the 2001 Fantafestival.

His contributions to the development of the Wankel engine earned him the title, \\"Father of the Wankel Engine in the United States\\". Bentele in Germany Bentele had been fascinated with engineering from an early age and graduated from the Technical University of Stuttgart in the fall of 1928 with a degree in mechanical and electrical engineering. Up until World War II he was working on turbine blade design for the Heinkel-Hirth, Germany's new jet engine. Bentele excelled at this task, and after the war he managed one of Heinkel-Hirth's few remaining machine shops, which had survived virtually unscathed. He excelled at this job and was approached to undertake the design and manufacture of much needed spare parts for Allied Jeeps. Bentele in the United States Bentele left his successful business at the request of the Americans and British in order to study and repair damaged German jet aircraft. Bentele successfully built twelve new aircraft for this purpose. While it is believed that he was interrogated at this time, Bentele made contacts which ultimately brought him to the United States. Bentele temporarily returned to Heinkel-Hirth in Germany and established a moped business there. During this time he worked on turbine, and direct fuel injection, engines for such companies as Bosch, L'Orange, Daimler-Benz, and the British Ministry of Supply. Shortly thereafter he immigrated to the United States, where he worked for Curtiss-Wright, developing new technologies. Curtiss-Wright Immediately after World War II, the Curtiss-Wright Corporation became a defense contractor supplying aircraft and aircraft engines. This American aircraft manufacturing company was directly descended from the business ventures of the Wright brothers and their fellow aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss. In 1949, Roy Hurley became president of the company and sought keenly to acquire Bentele's services. While Curtiss-Wright had once been one of the top aircraft and aircraft engine producers in the world, the company was slow to adopt the new turbojet engine, which began to dominate the market. There was simply no more tinkering that could be done to improve Curtiss's engines—a complete overhaul was necessary. Curtiss needed a new engine, if it were to compete for government contracts, which dominated the market. =The Wankel engine= Although Bentele did not have the proper government clearance—an issue which may have hindered him—he worked to his full potential and achieved results. In 1958, Roy Hurley acquired the Studebaker-Packard Corporation, and it was soon discovered that German automobile and engine producer NSU had been working on a remarkable engine concept: the Wankel rotary engine of Felix Wankel. Security surrounding this project was surprisingly lax for such a revolutionary invention, and it was even arranged for Bentele to study a model on his own, exploring the potential further development and production of such an engine at Curtiss- Wright. After a long weekend, Bentele emerged more than impressed with the project and became an admirer of a fellow mechanist Felix Wankel. =Chief Scientist= Bentele was one of several British, German and Swiss engineers that had recently been hired by Curtiss-Wright to broaden their line in engines. Bentele, when he went to Curtiss-Wright, was assigned, as a \\"Chief Scientist,\\" to assist the large number of Engineering Section Heads that carried out the design, development, testing, and analysis for production engines and experimental engines. Bentele, who was well qualified to help solve existing problems, was soon unwelcome at the various Section Head offices. There were several reasons for this less-than-enthusiastic acceptance, part of it being Bentele's energetic approach. Bentele may not have been properly coordinated into the largely independent Engineering and Research Departments. Hurley, by his own admission, was a \\"jackknife engineer\\" and did not come up through Engineering. Also Bentele was not modest, when he visited each office to review their technical problems: he generally concluded, \\"in Germany, we did it this way\\", which was interpreted as arrogant. Soon all doors were closed—with one exception: =Charles Jones= The youngest Section Head at Curtiss-Wright at that time, Charles Jones, was head of the Stress and Applied Mechanics Section, responsible for the structural integrity of Curtiss-Wright engines. Jones had a staff of 30 engineers, almost all with advanced degrees, but still had to put in an inordinate number of hours to keep up. He was delighted to have Bentele's experience, similar to that of Jones' but far more extensive, available to him. Bentele became a steady visitor, even before any Wankel issues came up. Therefore, it was quite natural for Bentele to ask Jones if he would try to develop the Wankel engine basic formulae (dimensions, dynamics, accelerations, velocities, vibrations, etc.) on weekends. Jones, already loaded on weekends, was intrigued and agreed. Within a few weekends Jones delivered the formulae and analyses to Bentele. =Patents= Curtiss-Wright, led by Roy Hurley, determined that rotary engine technology would provide the comeback they needed. The Germans were very familiar with and respectful of Bentele and he was a great asset to Curtiss-Wright. Unexpectedly, NSU, who held patents and rights to the Wankel-derived engine in many countries, failed to patent their engine in the United States, due to complex patent laws, and to their lawyer who was unfamiliar with these laws. Eventually, a deal was made that allowed Curtiss-Wright to gain a license on Wankel's technology, and this changed history. On October 21, 1958, Curtiss-Wright became the first company to purchase a license, for $2.1 million, and a 5% commission on all engines sold. Although Curtiss was forced to share major technological developments, Curtiss was the sole license holder of Wankel's technology in the United States. =Review of the Wankel engine= In 1958 Bentele was asked by Hurley to review the potential and, if promising, to head up the R&D; program on the Wankel rotary engine. Bentele told Jones that Hurley had asked him to review the prospects for the Wankel, and that he would depart for Germany and France (for the Planche rotary compressor experiments in France) to further check out related efforts, and review work at the Wankel Institute. He asked Jones to give up his present assignment and, working alone and in secret, at an offsite location, to make a theoretical evaluation of the engine's requirements and potential. Jones agreed and, a month later, Jones handed Bentele a thick volume containing the calculations. Jones had predicted major performance factors including heat rejection, fuel efficiency, power, size, etc. and concluded that certain design changes to cooling, structure, bearings, dynamic inversion, etc. had to be made to the \\"proof of concept\\" rigs that Wankel and NSU had built and briefly run, before the concept would be proven. =Modifications= The sealing elements were too fragile, as designed by Wankel, but the basic principle of using a pressure actuated cylindrical pin at each apex of the rotor was recognized. Making the trochoid profile \\"oversized\\", by the radius of the apex seal tip, was recognized as essential to seal, in three planes, and this was retained unchanged, but made heavier initially, and later changed to more rugged Curtiss-Wright patented designs that still retained the cylindrical pin. Shortly thereafter, the 'OK to proceed' was given, even though the license agreement had not yet been sealed. A completely separate engineering unit was formed, drawing the best from every department. All personnel were told that the work they did at the separate building was not to be discussed outside that building. Jones was assigned by Bentele to design the basic single rotor 60 cu. in. module and later, a two rotor (with & without center bearing) version, which became the workhorse for automotive, airplanes, silent \\"spy\\" aircraft, generator, automotive, inboard boat, and other engines for Curtiss-Wright, and the licensees that followed in the U.S. and elsewhere. Other groups were assigned to scale the single rotor engine up by the square root of 10 for potentially 1000 Hp/rotor, make a 4 rotor/integral shaft with split gears and bearings version for marine use, =The Wankel project becomes known to the public= Bentele started from first principles, running one of the most efficient research and development programs in the country, beginning with mathematical formulae, and solving of many problems before even physically touching the engine. Bentele determined what was needed and what was not, and was given full access to whatever resources he needed. Bentele's work on the engine was top secret, however word leaked to the public and it became common knowledge that Curtiss was developing a Wankel engine. The public was not familiar with the new engine, but rumors spread like wildfire regarding the engine's immense potential. When Curtiss went public with this information, NSU was angry, claiming that Bentele and Curtiss were trying to present the Wankel as a product of American ingenuity, and that they were denying any German involvement. The dispute was short-lived. As development continued throughout the early 1960s, Hurley and Curtiss were accused of fraudulent activity, as stocks soared. There was no actual product on the market at the time. Father of the Wankel Engine in the United States Bentele and his team studied the concepts of the Wankel rotary engine and started to design a prototype before the license was granted, settling on a design using most of Wankel's original geometric sealing designs in the DKM54 model. In its first dyno test in 1959, the new model, dubbed the IRC6, provided a spectacular performance of 100 bhp at 5500 rpm, which was impressive for such a small engine design.SAE Paper 886D Bentele and Jones then proceeded to design a custom cooling system that surpassed NSU's, with increased engine performance and reliability.U.S. patent 3,007,460, 11/7/61, M. Bentele, C. Jones, and F.P. Sollinger Extensive experimentation continued, following Bentele's orders, on nearly every aspect of the engine's design, the process taking several years and continuing after Bentele had left Curtiss-Wright. Output was gradually increased, as was the general size of the engine. The late RC2-60 engine was tested in a 1966 Ford Mustang and performed well, providing similar performance to the Mustang's original V8 with less fuel consumption, noise and vibration, and physical size. The engine was also emission tested in a study by Curtiss-Wright and the University of MichiganSAE Paper 700074, D.E. Cole and C. Jones, SAE Trans., April 1974 in a Ford Galaxy; GM and AMC also tested rotary engines in their vehicles but did not publish findings. =A new model= In November 1962, Bentele and his team developed a larger four-rotor variant of the RC2-60 called the 4RC-6 for heavy dutySAE Paper 720468, \\" A Survey of Curtiss- Wright's 1958-1971 Rotating Combustion Engine Technological Developments,\\" Detroit, 1972, Charles Jones and potential use in aircraft. It was the first multi-rotor Wankel engine built and was a technological masterpiece. =Leaving Curtiss-Wright= Through most of his career at Curtiss-Wright, which ended in May, 1967, when he went to Avco-Lycoming, Bentele was responsible for developing Wankel engine technology more than anyone, perhaps including Dr. Wankel himself. And although Curtiss-Wright amassed a large number of patented Wankel engine designs and design improvements, none of these engines were ever produced for the market by Curtiss-Wright, for complex corporate reasons. But they were used in commercially produced applications by licensees in the U.S. and abroad. John Deere was given the license for a nominal fee of $14 million, hoping to utilize such technology in its manufacture of farming and commercial equipment; nevertheless Bentele's work lives on in every Wankel engine produced around the world, as this technology was utilized by many manufacturers both in America and worldwide. Impact Bentele's knowledge of turbine jets contributed to the successful development of American jet airplanes, which immediately dominated the field. Much of what we know today about these engines originated with Bentele. Although the unique rotary engine was designed by Felix Wankel, the commercial success and worldwide applications of these engines were largely achieved by Bentele. Today compact and efficient rotary engines have commercial applications in automobiles, notably in Mazda sports and racing cars. Toyo Kogyo Kaisha, Limited (dba Mazda Motor Corporation) was one of the first to acquire a license for the Wankel in July 1960 (later ratified by the Japanese Government in July 1961RX-7 The New Mazda RX-7 and Mazda Rotary Engine Sports Cars by Jack K. Yamaguchi; 1985) and spent many years refining the design. Rotary engines are also found in marine craft, and small custom airplanes, built by enthusiasts and small aircraft companies. Bentele revolutionized the field of corporate engineering, research and development, and was chair of the SAE until his death on May 19, 2006. One of the most prestigious engineering awards, given by the SAE, is named after him. References Further reading * *Hege, John B. (January 2001). The Wankel Rotary Engine: A History.

About the group The Ritchie Boys consisted of approximately 15,200 servicemen who were trained for U.S. Army Intelligence during WWII at the secret Camp Ritchie training facility. Approximately 14%, or 2,200, of them were Jewish refugees born in Germany and Austria. Most of the men sent to Camp Ritchie for training were assigned there because of fluency in German, French, Italian, Polish, or other languages needed by the US Army during WWII. They had been drafted into or volunteered to join the United States Army and when their ability to speak the language of an enemy was discovered, they were sent to Camp Ritchie on secret orders. Some of the Jewish refugees who were part of this program had originally arrived in the US as children, many without their parents, and were also among the One Thousand Children. (One such OTC was Ambassador Richard Schifter.) They were trained at the Military Intelligence Training Center at Camp Ritchie in Maryland, now officially known as Fort Ritchie. They were specially trained in methods of intelligence, counterintelligence, interrogation, investigation and psychological warfare. (900 of these men also attended special training at Camp Sharpe, PA. The Jewish refugees were qualified for these tasks because they knew the German language and understood the German mentality and behavior better than most American-born soldiers.Kurt Frank Korf, quoted in Patricia Kollander, I Must be a Part of this War: A German American's Fight against Hitler and Nazism, Fordham University Press, 2005 ; p. 109. The role of these soldiers was therefore to work in the front lines (or even behind them), at strategic corps and army levels, at interrogation, analyzing German forces and plans, and also to study and demoralize the enemy. The majority of them went on to work as members of the US Counter Intelligence Corps;Sayer, Ian, and Douglas Botting, America's Secret Army: The Untold Story of the Counter Intelligence Corps.

Others followed over time. Shortly after reaching land, they left their units and pursued their special tasks. They were able to feed the Allies valuable information. Gen. Oscar Koch (Gen. Patton's G-2) acknowledged that the advance warning of the German Bulge offensive was made possible by information gathered by their MIS units. Moreover, the Ritchie Boys helped break German resistance by demoralizing them in both open and covert operations. They interrogated POWs and defectors to obtain information about German force levels, troop movements, and the physical and psychological state of the Germans. A common interrogation tactic was to use the Germans' fear of transfer into Soviet custody. By means of targeted disinformation via newspaper announcements, flyers, radio broadcasts, and sound trucks, the German population and military were encouraged to cease their resistance to the Allied invasion. =Post-war= After the war, many of the Ritchie Boys served as translators and interrogators, some during the Nuremberg Trials. Many of them went on to successful political, scientific, or business careers. The first-ever reunion of the Ritchie Boys took place from 23–25 July 2011 at the Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Another reunion was held in June 2012 in Washington, DC, and at Fort Ritchie, which by then had closed. =Notable Ritchie Boys= The Ritchie Boys included several prominent men: * Hans Habe * Klaus Mann * Oskar Seidlin * Stefan Heym * Hanus Burger * Gerald Geiger * George Mandler * Richard Schifter * Guy Stern * Werner Angress * Walter Schwarz * Hans Trefousse * Alfred de Grazia * Gilbert de Goldschmidt * J.D.

Often spelled without the prefix \\"Mac\\", the name has many variants, including Gehegan, Geoghan, Geohegan, Gahagan, Gagan, and Gagon which approximate the most common pronunciations of the name. It is usually pronounced , or . In Irish it is Mag Eochagáin, from Eochaidh. The initial \\"G\\" of Geoghegan comes from the prefix Mag, a variant of Mac and the anglicised form Mageoghegan or McGeoghegan was formerly much used. History = Correlation to ancient figures = The sept of the MacGeoghegans is of the southern Uí Néill, and said to be descended from Niall of the Nine Hostages. Niall was alive from the mid 4th century into the early 5th century. His father was Eochaid Mugmedón, of the line of Erimhon, one of the sons of Esbain who it is said took Ireland from the Tuatha de Danann. Niall's mother was Carthann Cas Dubh, daughter of the king of Britain. Niall's first wife was Inné, mother of his son Fiachu mac Néill, from who the Geoghegan family are said to be descended. He also had seven other sons with his second wife, Roighnech. Niall's ancestry is claimed by Irish myth to trace back to Miledh of Esbain, King of Spain, whose wife Scota was the daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh Nectanebo II. From there the line is sometimes traced to Niul who was married to the daughter of Pharaoh Cingris. = Niall of the Nine Hostages = Niall Noígíallach (, Old Irish \\"having nine hostages\\"),noí, nine; gíall, a human pledge or hostage; the possessive suffix -ach (Dictionary of the Irish Language, Compact Edition, 1990, pp. 360, 479–480; Rudolf Thurneysen, A Grammar of Old Irish, 1946, p. 220). Also spelled Noí nGiallach, Naígiallach, Naoighiallach etc or in English, Niall of the Nine Hostages, was a prehistoric Irish king, the ancestor of the Uí Néill dynasties that dominated the northern half of Ireland from the 6th to the 10th century. Irish annalistic and chronicle sources place his reign in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, although modern scholars, through critical study of the annals, date him about half a century later. He is presumed by some to have been a real person, or at the very least semi- historical but most of the information about him that has come down to us is regarded as legendary. There are various versions of how Niall gained his epithet Noígíallach. The saga \\"The Death of Niall of the Nine Hostages\\" says that he received five hostages from the five provinces of Ireland (Ulster, Connacht, Leinster, Munster and Meath), and one each from Scotland, the Saxons, the Britons and the Franks.Tom Peete Cross & Clark Harris Slover (eds.), \\"The Death of Niall of the Nine Hostages\\", Ancient Irish Tales, 1936, pp. 514–517 Keating says that he received five from the five provinces of Ireland, and four from Scotland.Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar Éirinn 1.48, 1.49, 1.50, 51, 52 O'Rahilly suggests that the nine hostages were from the kingdom of the Airgialla (literally \\"hostage-givers\\"), a satellite state founded by the Ui Néill's conquests in Ulster, noting that the early Irish legal text Lebor na gCeart (\\"The Book of Rights\\") says that the only duty of the Airgialla to the King of Ireland was to give him nine hostages..T. F. O'Rahilly, Early Irish History and Mythology, Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946 His son Fiachu mac Néill is said to be the ancestor of the Cenél Fiachach, a clan which included several well known sub-clans or septs such as Geoghegan and O'Higgins, whose lands extended from Birr to Uisnech in southern Westmeath and part of north Offaly and their southern territory became known as Fir Cell (land of the churches), and later the Barony of Moycashel.Byrne, Irish Kings and High Kings, p. 93. His son Túathal established a northern branch and his son Úathnemgenn a southern branch. Another son Crimthann was great-grandfather of a local saint Áed mac Bricc (died 589).Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, Appendix VII. On the other hand, it is claimed in the early 15th-century manuscript called Leabhar Breac that the Geoghegans are descended, not from Fiachu, son of Niall, but from a plebeian, Fiachu, son of Aedh. This claim so enraged the descendants of Fiachu, that they killed the author of the passage, even though he was under the protection of Suanach, the abbot of the monastery of Rahin.http://www.geoghegan.org/clan/ Geoghegans There have been several notable Geoghegans including: * Michael Geoghegan (b. 1953), former HSBC Group chief executive * Thomas Geoghegan (b. 1949), Chicago labour lawyer and politician * John Geoghegan (b. 1956), midfielder, Accrington Stanley FC * John Michael Geoghegan (1881-1847), Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh * Helen Gahagan Douglas (1900–1980), American actress and Congresswoman from California whose electoral defeat by Richard M.

History Burnside's Bridge =Construction= Seeking to improve connections between roads in Washington County, fourteen bridges were commissioned to be constructed. It is one of five bridges designed by master bridge builder John Weaver, its construction was completed 1836. It was constructed by local Dunker farmers. The three- arched, -wide, -long bridge provided a passageway over Antietam Creek for farmers to take their produce and livestock to market in Sharpsburg. The bridge's three arches are constructed of locally sourced coursed limestone, masonry walls contain the roadbed and has wooden parapets. The original cost of construction was $3200 (now between $73,000 and $84,000.) The bridge has two other names, one is \\"Rohrbach's Bridge\\", after a local farmer Henry Rohrbach who lived nearby. The second name, \\"Lower Bridge\\" is in reference to the Upper Bridge and Middle Bridge located further upstream that also allowed movement of freight, animals, and people across the creek. 51st New York Infantry and 51st Pennsylvania Infantry regiments across Burnside's Bridge, by Edwin Forbes. =Battle of Antietam= Crossing over Antietam Creek, the bridge played a key role in the September 1862 Battle of Antietam during the American Civil War when around 500 Confederate soldiers from Georgia under General Robert Toombs and Henry Benning,Damage Them All You Can, p. 176 for several hours held off repeated attempts by elements of the Union Army's IX Army Corps, whose leader was Major General Ambrose E. Burnside, to take the bridge. The first attempt was by Col. George Crook's Ohio brigade, partially supported by Edward Harland's brigade of Rodman's Division, but the Ohioans got lost and emerged too far upstream. The 11th Connecticut Infantry found the bridge, and engaged the Georgians under Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. After taking heavy casualties, the 11th Connecticut withdrew in all haste. The second try to carry the bridge was by the 2nd Division's 1st Brigade under James Nagle - the 2nd Maryland & the 6th New Hampshire Infantry rushed to the bridge via a nearby farm road but was stopped by the Georgia sharpshooters before getting halfway to the bridge. Toomb's 450 Georgians held off 14,000 Union attackers. Finally, the 51st New York Volunteer Infantry and the 51st Pennsylvania Infantry, from Brig. Gen. Edward Ferrero's brigade, attacked from the field on the Union side of the creek, stopped briefly at the walls near the bridge to duel with the sharpshooters, and then charged and seized it, but not before the attack had been delayed for several hours beyond what had been expected. =Landmark= After the war, the U.S. Government acquired the bridge and adjoining land. Vehicular traffic across the bridge was stopped and the original farm lanes allowed to grow over with grass. Foot traffic is still allowed across the structure, at the Antietam National Battlefield.

The car was built using a combination of WilliamsF1 engineering and construction and a BMW powerplant. The car was a predecessor to the BMW V12 LMR, which debuted in 1999. Development In 1995 McLaren Cars entered sports car racing using their McLaren F1 GTR in grand touring series like the BPR Global GT Series as well as the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The McLaren F1s were powered by a S70 V12, leading to McLaren and BMW signing an agreement to both develop their racing teams with the assistance of BMW Motorsport. This combination was successful in winning the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans. However, by 1997 the F1 GTRs were no longer competitive against newer breeds of specially homologated supercars from Mercedes-Benz and Porsche. Due to their declining performance, McLaren pulled out of GT racing at the end of 1997. Unwilling to give up so quickly, BMW Motorsport decided to move from grand tourers to Le Mans prototypes, open cockpit racing cars built specifically for racing and requiring no road legality regulations. During the 1997 decline of McLaren, BMW Motorsport announced a deal with WilliamsF1, at the time Formula One constructors champions, which would see Williams constructing the car's chassis and develop its aerodynamics for the 24 Hours of Le Mans. At the same time, BMW Motorsport turned to Schnitzer Motorsport, a long time BMW racing team, to be the factory team running the car, now dubbed the V12 LM. The V12 LMs would use the same S70 V12 as the McLaren F1s, although it would be run in its 5990cc configuration. The chassis incorporated an early use of a raised foot box as well as a front diffuser for better aerodynamics and safety. Racing history =1998= Debuting at the 1998 24 Hours of Le Mans test day in May, the two V12 LM chassis set times which were not favorable, their best lap placing them 11th behind factory entries from Porsche, Toyota, Nissan, and Mercedes-Benz, all of which were running grand tourer-style cars instead of the theoretically faster Le Mans prototypes. By the time qualifying for the race came around in June, the BMWs had improved to 6th fastest in qualifying, placing behind two Porsches, two Mercedes, and a Toyota. Unfortunately, during the race, both cars suffered quickly. Vibrations were detected in the drivetrains while at speed. In order to not risk a catastrophic failure of the car at speed, the team quickly retired both cars from the event after they had only covered 43 laps for car #2 and 60 laps for car #1. Following the team's dismal results at Le Mans, further testing found that the aerodynamics and cooling of the car were poorly planned and that the car could only perform best if ambient temperatures were at ideal conditions. The team originally planned to enter the 1998 Petit Le Mans, but later declined. It was therefore decided that the two V12 LMs would be abandoned and that BMW, Williams, and Schnitzer would start anew in 1999 with the V12 LMR. The two V12 LM chassis were therefore sold off to privateers, with chassis 001/98 going to Thomas Bscher while chassis 002/98 was sold to Team Goh of Japan. =1999= With BMW moving onto the all-new V12 LMR, only the two privateer teams were left to campaign the rejected V12 LM. Thomas Bscher aligned with David Price Racing forming Price+Bscher Racing to concentrate on the new American Le Mans Series as well as the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the ALMS, the car would take only two points scoring finishes, leaving it 13th in the points standings. While at Le Mans, the car would wind up taking 5th place overall, only 20 laps behind the V12 LMR which won. The car would make one final appearance at an FIA Sportscar Championship event at the Nürburgring, finishing 4th place overall. Team Goh, on the other hand, decided to concentrate solely on Le Mans, with the car failing to finish due to gearbox problems. The car made one final appearance at the Fuji 1000km where it took 3rd place overall, 6 laps behind a winning Nissan. =2000= For 2000, Team Goh announced a partnership with Japanese constructor Dome, in which the V12 LM would be heavily modified in order to correct its aerodynamic instabilities and cooling problems. The entire front end would be redesigned to relocate the cooling intakes, while vents were added to the side bodywork to assist in cooling. Unfortunately, the car never campaigned and no other team chose to buy the chassis. For Price+Bscher, David Price Racing reached an agreement to campaign for Panoz Motorsports of the United States, leaving Thomas Bscher to campaign his lone V12 LM. Although losing his assistance from David Price Racing, Bscher was able to run the car at Le Mans, where the car failed to finish due to gearbox damage from an accident, and at the Nurburgring SRWC round in September. Following this, Bscher would retire the car, ending the racing career of the V12 LM.

It covers his time in RAF Bomber Command from the very earliest days of war in 1939 through to 1943. Gibson wrote the book aged 25 in 1944 whilst off operations. He had by this time completed two full tours, each of 30 operations, with Bomber Command (with 83 and 106 Squadrons), another one as a night-fighter pilot with 29 Squadron and, as leader of the famous Dam Busters raid against the dams of the Ruhr Valley (Operation Chastise) with 617 Squadron in May 1943. It was first published in book form in 1946, to much critical acclaim and a fully uncensored account released in 2003. The book was serialised in the Sunday Express during the winter of 1944-45, following his death in September 1944, when his Mosquito crashed near Steenbergen in the Netherlands. Synopsis Gibson joined the RAF prior to the war, and he recounts the early stages of combat and the daily struggle with first the Handley Page Hampden and then the Avro Manchester aeroplanes on long and arduous missions into enemy airspace. He also clearly recounts the issues facing the early pilots taking the war to Germany from within what seemed an almost amateurish Bomber Command. Subsequently, he flew the renowned Avro Lancaster. He quickly learned how to stay alive and rapidly grew in experience and maturity, rising from Pilot Officer to a highly decorated Wing Commander. 2003 Reprint Using Gibson's original draft, the reprint restored elements originally omitted – such as Gibson's views on fellow pilots and staff, air tactics and the deployment of Bomber Command. On the 75th anniversary of Gibson's death, September 19th 2019, Greenhill Books released a new illustrated edition of the book. The new edition retains the introduction by Sir Arthur Harris and adds new commentary from historian James Holland. In his introduction Holland writes, \\"He was certainly flawed, but his flaws make his achievements all the more remarkable... read it carefully, and particularly this original draft, and the fears, the stress and strain, and the tragedy of his short life are there, plain to see.\\" The Greenhill edition also includes extensive notes by Dr Robert Owen, official historian of 617 Squadron and more than 100 photographs, many of which had not been published elsewhere before.https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1784384909?pf_rd_p=330fbd82-d4fe-42e5-9c16-d4b886747c64&pf;_rd_r=PBJRYRS9Z15X0FYQD70E Film The 1954 film, The Dam Busters, was based on both Gibson's Enemy Coast Ahead and on Paul Brickhill's The Dam Busters.

The class has been termed the \\"penicillin of antifungals,\\" along with the related papulacandins, as their mechanism of action resembles that of penicillin in bacteria. β-glucans are carbohydrate polymers that are cross-linked with other fungal cell wall components, the fungal equivalent to bacterial peptidoglycan. Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are semisynthetic echinocandin derivatives with limited clinical use due to their solubility, antifungal spectrum, and pharmacokinetic properties.  Medical uses  Drugs and drug candidates in this class are fungicidal against some yeasts (most species of Candida, but not Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, and Rhodotorula). Echinocandins also have displayed activity against Candida biofilms, especially in synergistic activity with amphotericin B and additive activity with fluconazole. Echinocandins are fungistatic against some molds (Aspergillus, but not Fusarium and Rhizopus), and modestly or minimally active against dimorphic fungi (Blastomyces and Histoplasma). They have some activity against the spores of the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii, formerly known as Pneumocystis carinii. Caspofungin is used in the treatment of febrile neutropenia and as \\"salvage\\" therapy for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Micafungin is used as prophylaxis against Candida infections in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.  Side effects All three agents are well-tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being fever, rash, nausea, and phlebitis at the infusion site. They can also cause a histamine-like reaction (flushing) when infused too rapidly. Toxicity is uncommon. Its use has been associated with elevated aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase levels.Cancidas. Prescribing information-(caspofungin acetate) for injection. Merck & Co Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ 2008.  Chemistry  Caspofungin The present-day clinically used echinocandins are semisynthetic pneumocandins, which are chemically lipopeptide in nature, consisting of large cyclic hexapeptoids. Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin are similar cyclic hexapeptide antibiotics linked to long modified N-linked acyl fatty acid chains. The chains act as anchors on the fungal cell membrane to facilitate antifungal activity. Due to their limited oral bioavailability, echinocandins are administered through intravenous infusion.  Mechanism of action  Echinocandins noncompetitively inhibit beta-1,3-D-glucan synthase enzyme complex in susceptible fungi to disturb fungal cell glucan synthesis. Beta-glucan destruction prevents resistance against osmotic forces, which leads to cell lysis. They have fungistatic activity against Aspergillus species. and fungicidal activity against most Candida spp., including strains that are resistant to fluconazole. In vitro and mouse models show echinocandins may also enhance host immune responses by exposing highly antigenic beta-glucan epitopes that can accelerate host cellular recognition and inflammatory responses.  Resistance  Echinocandin resistance is rare among Candida spp. However, case studies have shown some resistance in C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. lusitaniae, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. Resistance patterns include alterations in the glucan synthase (Fks1-Fks2 complex), overexpression of efflux pumps, strengthening of cell wall by increased chitin production, upregulation of stress-response pathways, and dysregulation of mismatch repair pathways. In addition a few species and strains of Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. show a \\"paradoxic effect\\", i.e., they are susceptible to low concentrations but resistant to high concentrations in broth microdilution studies. Several non- candidal yeasts, e.g., Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, Rhodotorula and Blastoschizomyces and filamentous fungi like Fusarium, zygomycetes and Scedosporium are often resistant to echinocandins.y Echinocandins have weak in vitro activity (a high minimum inhibitory concentration) and very little clinical efficacy against Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides, especially their yeast forms.  Pharmacokinetics  Due to the large molecular weight of echinocandins, they have poor oral bioavailability and are administered by intravenous infusion. In addition, their large structures limit penetration into cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and eyes. In plasma, echinocandins have a high affinity to serum proteins. Echinocandins do not have primary interactions with CYP450 or P-glycoprotein pumps. Caspofungin has triphasic nonlinear pharmacokinetics, while micafungin (hepatically metabolized by arylsulfatase, catechol O-methyltransferase, and hydroxylation) and anidulafungin (degraded spontaneously in the system and excreted mostly as a metabolite in the urine) have linear elimination. Younger patients exhibit a faster rate of elimination of micafungin and caspofungin. Interference Caspofungin has some interference with ciclosporin metabolism, and micafungin has some interference with sirolimus (rapamycin), but anidulafungin needs no dose adjustments when given with ciclosporin, tacrolimus, or voriconazole. Advantages Advantages of echinocandins: * Broad range (especially against all Candida), thus can be given empirically in febrile neutropenia and stem cell transplant * Can be used in case of azole-resistant Candida or use as a second-line agent for refractory aspergillosis * Long half-life (polyphasic elimination: alpha phase 1–2 hours + beta phase 9–11 hours + gamma phase 40–50 hours) * Low toxicity: only histamine release (3%), fever (2.9%), nausea and vomiting (2.9%), and phlebitis at the injection site (2.9%), very rarely allergy and anaphylaxis * Not an inhibitor, inducer, or substrate of the cytochrome P450 system, or P-glycoprotein, thus minimal drug interactions * Lack of interference from kidney failure and hemodialysis * No dose adjustment is necessary based on age, gender, race * Better (or no less effective) than amphotericin B and fluconazole against yeast (mainly Candida, NOT yeast form of dimorphic) infections Disadvantages Disadvantages of echinocandins: * Cryptococcus, Trichosporon, and zygomycetes are often resistant to echinocandins and they show weak activity against yeast forms of Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides. * Embryotoxic in animal studies (category C) thus should be avoided if possible in pregnancy * Some need adjustment of dosing for patients with liver disease. * Poor ocular penetration in fungal endophthalmitis Examples List of echinocandins: * Pneumocandins (cyclic hexapeptides linked to a long-chain fatty acid) * Echinocandin B not clinically used, risk of hemolysis * Cilofungin withdrawn from trials due to solvent toxicity * Caspofungin (trade name Cancidas, by Merck) * Micafungin (FK463) (trade name Mycamine, by Astellas Pharma.) * Anidulafungin (VER-002, V-echinocandin, LY303366) (trade name Eraxis, by Pfizer) * Rezafungin formerly CD101 IV, Rezafungin is considered to be safest echinocandins which also acts longest (weekly single dose). It is developed by Cidara Therapeutics. The STRIVE Trial (phase 2) showed weekly treatment with Rezafungin was safe and efficacious in the treatment of candidemia and/or invasive candidiasis.

Screening of natural products of fungal fermentation in the 1970s led to the discovery of echinocandins, a new group of antifungals with broad-range activity against Candida spp. One of the first echinocandins of the pneumocandin type, discovered in 1974, echinocandin B, could not be used clinically due to risk of high degree of hemolysis. Screening semisynthetic analogs of the echinocandins gave rise to cilofungin, the first echinofungin analog to enter clinical trials, in 1980, which, it is presumed, was later withdrawn for a toxicity due to the solvent system needed for systemic administration. The semisynthetic pneumocandin analogs of echinocandins were later found to have the same kind of antifungal activity, but low toxicity. The first of these newer echinocandins to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was caspofungin, and later micafungin and anidulafungin were also approved. All these preparations have very low oral bioavailability, so they must be given intravenously to be useful. Echinocandins have become one of the first-line treatments for Candida before the species are identified, and even as antifungal prophylaxis in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.

He was born in Jackson County, Mississippi. He was the co-leader of a gang known as the Wages and Copeland Clan. On October 30, 1857, Copeland was executed by hanging in Perry County, Mississippi.  Early life  Born on January 18, 1823, in Jackson County, Mississippi, to Isham Copeland and Rebecca Wells, James Copeland began school at approximately age ten or eleven. Although his father was willing to put him through school for as long as James desired, he began associating with people who taught him fraud and how to cheat and steal. It was reported that he would often trick his schoolmates out of their money and pocket knives. James Copeland himself once said, his first great theft was a valuable pocket knife of a neighbor, whom he tricked out of it. He did this when he was twelve, although he stated he stole from his schoolmates long before this. His next great theft was when he was fourteen. He and his brother, Isham, nicknamed Whinn, went out for a night claiming they were going hunting. Instead, they stole fifteen hogs from a person nearby and went to Mobile to sell them for the sum of $30. He later went back to that person's house and tried to steal more hogs, but he was caught and arrested by the Jackson County Sheriff and charged with larceny. Realizing that the lawyer Copeland's father had hired would not prevent incarceration, Copeland's mother contacted Gale H. Wages, a notorious thief from Mobile, Alabama. Wages first considered waylaying and killing the witness to the hog theft but settled on destroying the evidence instead. Wages and James Copeland burned the Jackson County Courthouse to the ground one night, destroying evidence and everything else housed in the building. Still a teenager, Copeland joined with the Mobile bandits led by Wages and Charles \\"Preacher\\" McGrath. Wages took Copeland to a gathering in Mobile, where he was initiated as a member of a large clan that engaged in theft and other crimes for profit. He took the clan's oath: \\"You solemnly swear upon the Holy Evangelist of Almighty God, that you will never divulge, and always conceal and never reveal any of the signs or passwords of our order; that you will not invent any sign, token or device by which the secret mysteries of our order may be known; that you will not in any way betray or cause to be betrayed any member of this order — the whole under pain of having your head severed from your body — so help you God.\\" Perry County, Mississippi WPA Files: The Notorious Copeland Gang. Copeland learned the secret codes and alphabet of the clan, and he eventually brought four of his brothers into the clan.Howell, Elmo. 1998. Mississippi Back Roads. 369 p. The clan's criminal activities consisted primarily of the theft of Negro slaves and horses, the looting and burning of houses and stores, counterfeiting, boat larceny, and murder. Copeland knew of water hideouts and boat slips as well as he knew the land. He and his gang burned parts of Mobile, sacked it then disappeared into Mobile Bay. Copeland set fire to the West Side of Mobile and while the citizens were braving the flames to save what they could, the gang looted the East side. After things cooled down, Copeland set fire to the East side and sacked the West side of the port city. Each time, the raiders loaded boats with their plunder and disappeared into the dark waters of Mobile Bay.  The gang  The reported 60 membersPitts, J.R.S. 1874.

James Andrew Harvey had purchased, in good faith, a farm from Brown, who did not hold clear title to the property. Unable to establish ownership, Harvey refused to pay the outstanding debt. Brown passed the loan along to Wages, who was to either collect the money or kill Harvey. However, Harvey killed Wages and McGrath. On July 15, 1848, James Copeland and his gang rode to James Harvey's home on Red Creek in Perry County (now Forrest County), Mississippi. They had been offered one-thousand dollars by Wages' father, to avenge his son's death. Here, the Copeland clan fought a blazing gun battle, which resulted in the death of Harvey and one of Copeland's men. Batson, Brax. Voices from History: The Harvey Gun Battle. The Times of Stone County Mississippi. Posted May 14, 2009. Friends carried the mortally wounded Harvey to John Dale's home in northwestern Harrison County (now Stone County), where he died several days later and was buried in the nearby Dale Cemetery. In 1974, Harvey's remains were exhumed and reinterred in Pearl River County, Mississippi.  Imprisonment and later execution  Cover of Pitts' 1874 book on the life of James Copeland depicting \\"The Famous Harvey Battle\\". Although Copeland escaped the gun battle, he was eventually captured near Mobile in 1849, tried for his Alabama crimes, and sentenced to a four-year prison term. Upon completion of the prison term, Copeland was transferred to Mississippi to stand trial for the Harvey killing, for which he was convicted and sentenced to hang. Before his death on the gallows in 1857, Copeland made a full confession to Sheriff J.R.S. Pitts in Perry County, Mississippi, naming each member of the clan. Many clan members were prominent citizens of Mobile and the surrounding area.  Burial, grave robbing, and public display  Copeland's body was buried on the banks of the Leaf River near Augusta, Mississippi. After two or three days, the body disappeared, however and a skeleton was purportedly made of his remains. The skeleton was allegedly exhibited at McInnis and Dozier Drugstore in Hattiesburg, Mississippi in the late 19th century. In the early 1900s, the skeleton vanished and has never been seen again.  Copeland treasure  Copeland detailed how his clan had buried some $30,000 in gold in a swamp near Mobile and later reburied the treasure in the Catahoula Swamp of Hancock County, Mississippi. Rumors have circulated for decades of Copeland gold caches, still unclaimed, hidden around the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.

The medical center is one of the largest hospitals in Europe. Medical services at the University of Freiburg date back to the university's founding in 1457, as the Faculty of Medicine was one of the four founding faculties. History The Department of Surgery The Faculty of Medicine was founded together with the University of Freiburg in 1457. In 1751, the medical faculty began charity medical activities and the first general clinic (Allgemeines Kranken-Spital) was established. In the 19th century a medical center was built, followed by an entire campus with different specialized departments. In 1887 the psychiatric clinic was constructed. In 1926 the architect Adolf Lorenz began building a modern hospital complex at the present hospital location. During the bombing raid of 1944, almost all medical center facilities were destroyed. In 1952 the reconstruction of the medical center in accordance with the original plans began. Since then, the medical center has continuously expanded and added many institutes and satellite clinics. Patient care Today, the hospital boasts 1,600 beds and treats 65,000 in-patients each year. Around 380,000 out-patients are seen annually. The University Medical Center employs approximately 10,000 people, including over 1,200 doctors and around 2,800 nurses. As a tertiary care center and major European hospital, virtually all specialties and subspecialties are represented at the University Medical Center Freiburg. There are numerous large centers which bundle resources and expertise in order to provide optimal treatment, among them the aforementioned Cardiovascular Diseases Center Freiburg–Bad Krozingen, the Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, the Tumorzentrum Ludwig Heilmeyer - Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg, as well as the Liver Center Freiburg, the International Pancreas Carcinoma Center, the Neurocenter, the Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology, or the Epilepsy Center. Aside from the clinics and institutes, the Medical Center also houses extensive research facilities, many lecture halls, and even an own power station. Recognition and affairs Many medical breakthroughs have been achieved in Freiburg, such as the first use of the TIPS procedure on a patient worldwide, the first implantation of the artificial heart Jarvik-2000 in central Europe or the first combined heart- lung transplantation in the state of Baden-Württemberg. In 2010, the Medical Center's International Pancreatic Cancer Center was the first in Germany to perform a laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.http://www.pankreas-karzinom- zentrum.de/pankreaskarzinom-zentrum/aktuelles.php?we_objectID=146 All are procedures available only in a select few hospitals. In 2004, the University Medical Center Freiburg became the first clinic in Germany to perform a blood group incompatible kidney transplantation. With over 40 such transplantations to date, the University Medical Center Freiburg is one of the most experienced centers regarding this new procedure.http://www.transplantationszentrum- freiburg.de/ABOi.htmlhttp://www.aerzteblatt.de/v4/news/news.asp?p=Freiburg&src;=suche&id;=30200 The annual budget of the University Medical Center amounts to approximately EUR 600 million.http://skl14b.ukl.uni- freiburg.de/onlinemagazin/live/Fakten.html The park at the University Medical Center In March 2007 the university clinic's Tumorzentrum Ludwig Heilmeyer - Comprehensive Cancer Center Freiburg (CCCF) was named an oncological center of excellence, one of the first four in Germany to be specially funded by the German Cancer Aid. The University Medical Center Freiburg has recently set up a Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency (CCI), selected to be funded with up to 50 Mio EUR over the next 5–10 years as an Integrated Research and Treatment Center by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. In 2010, the Medical Center decided to found a Comprehensive Lung Center with regards to the further increasing importance of lung diseases.http://idw- online.de/de/news391841 In April 2012 the Cardiovascular Center at the University Medical Center Freiburg fused with the Heart-Center Bad Krozingen to form the Heart Center Freiburg University (Universitäres Herz- und Kreislaufzentrum Freiburg-Bad Krozingen) which has become the largest heart center in Germany.http://www.pr.uni- freiburg.de/pm/2008/pm.2008-06-05.187/view?set_language=en The University Medical Center Freiburg is the largest hospital to be certified by the (de) (KTQ, Cooperation for Quality and Transparency in Healthcare), the most widespread certification procedure at German hospitals. The aim of KTQ is to make a voluntary certification procedure available to hospitals and to promote continuous improvement and internal quality management. The KTQ certification seal is valid for three years, after which a reevaluation must be performed. The University Medical Center was first certified in 2005 and recently recertified in 2008. Education The University Medical Center Freiburg is home to the University of Freiburg Faculty of Medicine, a top ranking German medical school, and is the faculty's primary teaching hospital. The Medical Center also possesses an Academy for Medical Professions (Akademie für Medizinische Berufe) including a nursing school, a physiotherapist school, and a midwifery school.

He made his professional debut in 2002, reaching the top makuuchi division just two years later. The highest rank he reached was komusubi, which he held on three separate occasions, but never retained for more than one tournament. He earned one special prize, for Technique. He wrestled for the Tokitsukaze stable and acquired Japanese citizenship in 2014. Tokitenkū was diagnosed with malignant lymphoma in 2015 and retired from sumo in 2016 to become a coach; he was the first Mongolian-born wrestler to acquire the right to remain with the Sumo Association as a coach following retirement as an active wrestler. He died in January 2017. Early life and sumo background Born in Töv Province, Mongolia, Tokitenkū was the son of a Mongolian wrestler, who reached a rank equivalent to komusubi in Mongolian wrestling. He first came to Japan in March 2000 to study at Tokyo University of Agriculture, having deferred his studies at Mongolian State University of Agriculture. Although he joined the university's sumo club and won the under 100 kg collegiate championships in his first year, he originally intended to return to Mongolia to teach what he had learned about agricultural administration and food technology in Japan. He was inspired to enter professional sumo by watching active wrestlers Asashōryū and Asasekiryū, with whom he had practised judo as a teenager in Ulaanbaatar. He joined Tokitsukaze stable when in his second year of university, just before reaching the upper age limit of 23 set by the Japan Sumo Association. He graduated from the Tokyo University of Agriculture in March 2004. Career Upon entry he was given the shikona or fighting name of Tokitenkū, a reference to Mongolia's clear sky. He began his career in July 2002, winning all of his first 22 official bouts and earning three consecutive division championships in the process. He was the third person to achieve the feat of three consecutive championships, and his 22 consecutive wins tied the record for fourth-highest, with only Jokoryu (27) and Itai and Tochiazuma (26) having a longer unbeaten run upon entering professional sumo. He progressed to the second highest jūryō division in March 2004 and, just two tournaments later, to the top makuuchi division. It took him only 12 tournaments from his professional debut to make the top division, which at the time was the equal-fastest rise since the format of six tournaments per year was introduced in 1958. Tokitenku in May 2009 He was not able at first to maintain his makuuchi position, dropping back to jūryō twice, but a result of 10-5 in November 2005 gained him the rank of maegashira 1 as well as the technique prize. He made his san'yaku or titled rank debut in March 2007 at komusubi, where he defeated yokozuna Asashōryū on the opening day but missed out on another special prize by falling just short of a majority of wins, posting a 7-8 score. He returned to komusubi in July 2007, but again scored 7-8. In 2008 he suffered make-koshi (i.e. a losing record of 7-8 or worse) at all six tournaments of the year. He pulled out of the January 2010 tournament on Day 10 after dislocating his big toe; this was his first career withdrawal. He came back strongly posting three winning records in the next three tournaments, which sent him up to maegashira 1 for the September 2010 tournament. However, there he recorded a disastrous 2-13 score. Tokitenkū returned to the komusubi rank for the first time in 35 tournaments in July 2013, the second longest post-1925 wait for a san'yaku return after Aobajō's 47 tournament wait between 1975 and 1983. Tokitenkū achieved this despite being ranked as low as maegashira 8 in May. A series of poor performances after that saw him demoted to jūryō for the first time since 2005, but he secured an immediate return to the top division with a 10–5 at the rank of jūryō 3 in March 2014. He repeated this achievement once again when he was demoted in September 2014 and bounced back with a jūryō championship to again return to the top division. In 2015, he completed two tournaments in the top division, dropped back to jūryō in May and returned to the top division one tournament later. After losing records in July and September 2015 he withdrew from the November tournament after being diagnosed with malignant lymphoma. Having been in and out of hospital since October, he also withdrew from the January 2016 tournament to discuss his future with his stablemaster before the spring tournament in Osaka. After missing his fifth consecutive tournament in July 2016, his rank on the banzuke had dropped through the un-salaried ranks to West 26 in the third-tier Sandanme division. Retirement and death The Japan Sumo Association announced on August 26, 2016, that Tokitenkū had retired. He had become a Japanese citizen in January 2014 and had purchased the Magaki kabu (elder stock) in May 2014 from former yokozuna Wakanohana Kanji II, making him the first Mongolian-born wrestler to acquire the right to remain with the sumo association following retirement. He became known as Magaki Oyakata and worked as a coach at Tokitsukaze stable, the second Mongolian-born wrestler to remain as a coach after Kyokutenhō. Speaking about his condition he said that \\"with prolonged treatment it was difficult to return to physical strength and continue sumo.\\" He recalled his most memorable bout as being his playoff win for the sandanme championship in January 2003, against his stablemate Toyonoshima. Tokitenkū died on 31 January 2017 at the age of 37. He had been housebound since October, and was unable to perform his oyakata duties at the November 2016 and January 2017 tournaments. Fighting style When Tokitenkū began his sumo career he weighed around , but he gained weight steadily and reached about , average for the top division. He favoured a migi-yotsu grip on the mawashi, with his left hand outside and right hand inside his opponent's arms. His most common winning technique was yori-kiri, or force out, although he also relied on pull-down techniques such as hataki- komi and hiki-otoshi. He was fond of throwing moves (nage). He was very adept at using tripping techniques which he had gained from his experience in judo, winning 17 career bouts by uchigake (inside leg trip). He used the extremely rare trip nimaigeri (ankle kicking twist down) on eleven occasions, although he was not credited with the technique in the top division until May 2011 in a win over Shōtenrō.

Wildlife of Myanmar includes its flora and fauna and their natural habitats.  Flora  Like all Southeastern Asian forests, the forests of Myanmar can be divided into two categories: monsoon forest and rainforest. Monsoon forest is dry at least three months a year, and is dominated by deciduous trees. Myanmar's monsoon forest ecoregions are the Rainforest has a rainy season of at least nine months, and are dominated by broadleaf evergreen. In the region north of the Tropic of Cancer, in the Himalayan region, subtropical broadleaf evergreen dominates to an elevation of 2000m, and from 2000m to 3000m, semi-deciduous broadleaf dominates, and above 3000m, evergreen conifers and subalpine forest are the primary fauna until the alpine scrubland. The area from Yangon to Myitkyina is mostly monsoon forest, while peninsular Malaysia south of Mawlamyine is primarily rainforest, with some overlap between the two. Along the coasts of Rakhine State and Tanintharyi Division, tidal forests occur in estuaries, lagoons, tidal creeks, and low islands. These forests are host to the much-depleted Myanmar Coast mangroves habitat of mangrove and other trees that grow in mud and are resistant to sea water. Forests along the beaches consist of palm trees, hibiscus, casuarinas, and other trees resistant to storms.  Fauna  Myanmar is home to nearly 300 known mammal species, 300 reptile species, and about 100 bird species. There is also number of non-marine molluscs in Myanmar.

Live coral, Madoogali reef Recent scientific studies suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between atolls following a north–south gradient. But important differences between neighbour atolls were also found (especially in terms of benthic fauna), which may be linked to differences in terms of fishing pressure - including poaching. Vertebrates Plectorhinchus vittatus (Oriental Sweetlips) =Fish= Manta rays (Manta birostris) taken at Himandhoo Manta Point, Maldives There is an amazing diversity of sealife in the Maldives archipelago, with corals and over 2,000 species of fish, ranging from colorful reef fish to the Caribbean reef shark, moray eels, and a wide variety of rays: manta ray, stingray, and eagle ray. The Maldivian waters are also home for the whale shark. The waters around the Maldives are abundant in rare species of biological and commercial value, with tuna fisheries being traditionally one of the main commercial resources of the country, with shells. In the few ponds and marshes there are freshwater fish, like Chanos chanos and other smaller species. The tilapia or mouth-breeder was introduced by a UN agency in the 1970s. =Reptiles and amphibians= Calotes versicolorSince the islands are very small, land-based reptiles are rare. There is a species of gecko, as well as one species of agamid lizard, Calotes versicolor,Bluepeace, Environment News, Articles and Reports, 2007 the skink Lygosoma albopunctatum, the wolf snake Lycodon aulicus and a small harmless blind snake Ramphotyphlops braminus. In the sea there are turtles, like the green turtle, the hawksbill turtle and the leatherback turtle, that lay eggs on Maldivian beaches. Pelagic sea snakes (Hydrophis platurus) that live in the Indian Ocean are occasionally cast up onto the shore after storms, where they are rendered helpless and unable to return to the sea. Saltwater crocodiles have also been known to reach the islands and dwell in marshy areas. The short-headed Sphaerotheca rolandae frog is found in a few islands, while the toad Bufo melanostictus has a more widespread presence.Phillips, W.W.A., Some observations on the fauna of the Maldive Islands.

Most of the species are characteristic of Eurasian migratory birds, only a few being typically associated with the Indian sub-continent. Some of them are seasonal, like the frigatebirds. There are also birds that dwell in marshes and island bush, like the grey heron and the moorhen. White terns are found occasionally on the southern islands due to their rich habitats. Phillips, W. W. A., The Birds of the Maldive Islands, Indian Ocean. J. Bombay Nat. Hist. Soc. 60: 546-584. Bombay 1963 =Mammals= There are very few land mammals in the Maldives. Only the flying fox and a species of shrew could be said to be endemic. Cats, rats, and mice have been introduced by humans, often invading the uninhabited areas of islands and becoming pests. It is strictly forbidden to bring dogs to the Maldives.IATA - Maldives Customs, Currency & Airport Tax regulations details In the ocean surrounding the islands there are several species of whales and dolphins. Occasionally stray seals from Subantarctic waters have been recorded to reach the islands.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, a Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Nova Ethnographia Indica. 1999 Invertebrates The islands of the Maldives themselves have been built by the massive growth of coral, a group of living beings. =Coelenterata= There are many kinds of anemones and jellyfish in the Maldivian waters. =Arthropods= right There are four species of lobsters and many different species of crabs in the Maldives. Some crabs live in the water, but many live on the beach burrowing holes in the sand by the waterline, like the ghost crab. Fiddler crabs are common on muddy reef shelves. Certain crab species of the islands are adapted to a purely terrestrial environment. Hermit crabs live under the leaves of shore bushes. There is a type of land crab that can be a domestic pest, living in holes in the houses. Some species of prawns and shrimp live in the islands but they are not fished with commercial purposes. There is a kind of centipede, as well as millipedes, a small type of scorpion, and certain species of spiders. Several species of spiders are found in Maldives. Spiders exhibit remarkable affinity with those found in the southwestern coast of Indian mainland and Sri Lanka. A pioneering work on spiders of Maldives was conducted by R. I. Pocock in 1904 in the work Fauna and Geography of Maldives. A few common spiders include the brown huntsman spider (Heteropoda venatoria), Plexippus paykulli, Argiope anasuja, and lynx spiders, and black widows are very occasionally seen on Hulhumalé island and Malé International Airport. =Mollusks= Octopuses, squid, and clams are common on Maldivian reefs. The giant clam, Tridacna gigas, is common on the reef shelf. =Echinoderms= The Maldive reefs teem with starfish, brittle stars, and sea urchins. Sea cucumbers are now a source of income, being exported to east Asian markets. However, they were not traditionally a form of local fishery. Recent studies show that sea cucumbers are subject to massive overfishing in Maldives, most of it being probably illegal poaching. Plants Hernandia nymphaeifolia, a tree species found in the Maldives The Maldives have a rich variety of plant life, despite the lack of fertile soils. Three plant communities exist in the Maldives. The first is the foreshore, which is closest to the ocean and mostly bare except for hardy creeping vines such as Ipomoea spp. The next is the beach crest, which is slightly more protected from the tides. Scaevola taccada, Pemphis acidula, Tournefortia argentea, and Guettarda speciosa are very common and often dominant in the plant communities. Finally, the inner island habitats are the most protected. Sometimes dense coconut plantations and moist soils offer extra allow the growth of understory trees, like Morinda citrifolia or Guettarda speciosa. On northern islands, Hibiscus tiliaceus or Premna serratifolia form pure stands. Mixed forests are also common. Out of the vascular plants of the Maldives, 260 grow in the wild and are either native or naturalized, while an additional 323 are cultivated. =Mangrove forests= Mangroves are found in brackish or muddy areas of the Maldives. Fourteen species over ten genera are native to the Maldives, including one fern, Acrostichum aureum. Ecology The land- based biotopes of the Maldives are highly endangered. The little land available in the country is being swiftly developed. Formerly uninhabited islands were only occasionally visited, but now almost no untouched uninhabited islands remain. Many of the natural habitats of local species have been severely threatened or destroyed during the past decades of development. Coral reef habitats have also been damaged, as the pressure for land has brought about the creation of artificial islands. Some reefs have been filled with rubble with little regard for the changes in the currents on the reef shelf and how the new pattern would affect coral growth and its related life forms on the reef edges.

It was directed by James B. Clark. Plot The story revolves around twelve-year-old Sam Gribley (Teddy Eccles), a devotee of Thoreau (as many were back in the 1960s). He decides to leave Toronto to spend time alone in the Canadian woods to see if he can make it as a self-sufficient spirit after his parents' promised summer trip doesn't pan out. He also wants to work on an algae experiment while he is there. Sam's immediate companion is Gus, his pet raccoon, which lives with him in the city. He gathers supplies at a local store, hops on a bus, and heads down the 401 with Gus to what he calls \\"the Laurentian Mountains of Quebec\\". In actuality he ends up in the picturesque town of Knowlton, Quebec, southeast of Montreal, in the Notre Dame Mountains Range of the northern Appalachian Mountains chain along the eastern coast of North America from northern Georgia. Here he finds the perfect mountain stream and pond location to build a home in an old dead tree. He begins his long-planned algae experiments and proves his ability as a solitary young Thoreau living off the land and communing fully with nature. Sam wants badly not to have to feel needful of the urban and modern world, however, the sight of a falcon overhead inspires his curiosity about falconry. He journeys back to Knowlton and to the local library, where the librarian and bird-enthusiast Miss Turner (Tudi Wiggins) supplies him with books on falconry. He steals a chick from a local falcon's nest. It, whom he names Frightful, becomes his new best friend and food supplier, after he teaches it to hunt. One day, returning to his tree home, he finds an older man there. Bando (Theodore Bikel) is a wandering folk singer traveling the world in search of folk songs and traditions. They share survival ideas, lore with one another, and enlighten each other's worlds. They enjoy each other's pancake recipes. (Sam makes acorn pancakes and Bando makes great syrup). Sam and Bando bond over the summer, but as September's cold air approaches, Bando tells Sam that he has to leave before winter comes on. They climb the nearby mountain together and Bando says his good-byes. Sam is lonely. Frightful is killed by an insensitive hunter. Sam is devastated, but still manages to survive as winter sets in. His bright demeanor returns as he witnesses the local fauna playing in the winter snow. He also has the warmth of his tree home in place after building a makeshift chimney out of clay from his pond. Sam and Gus sleep by the fire as a terrible blizzard sweeps in. Soon their tree home is blanketed in snow, and without air they will suffocate in the smoke-filled chamber. Panic-stricken, Sam begins to dig his way through the snowed-in doorway to the outside air. Luckily, Bando and Miss Turner have decided to pay him a Christmas visit. They help dig him and Gus out. The four have a Christmas celebration and sing \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" over Bando's guitar playing. Bando shows Sam newspaper reports of his parents' concern over their missing son. He decides that he should go home, knowing that he accomplished even more than he set out for. The four head off around the side of the mountain.

It was published sometime between 1829 and 1833 in the late Edo period as the first print in Hokusai's series Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji. It is Hokusai's most famous work and is often considered the most recognizable work of Japanese art in the world. The image depicts an enormous wave threatening three boats off the coast in the Sagami Bay (Kanagawa Prefecture) while Mount Fuji rises in the background. Sometimes assumed to be a tsunami, the wave is more likely to be a large rogue wave. As with the other prints in the series, it depicts the area and activities around Mount Fuji under varying conditions. Throughout the series are dramatic uses of Berlin blue pigment.  Hokusai  Hokusai, self-portrait from 1839 Hokusai began painting when he was six years old. At age twelve, his father sent him to work at a bookseller's. At sixteen, he was apprenticed as an engraver and spent three years learning the trade. At the same time he began to produce his own illustrations. At eighteen he was accepted as an apprentice to Katsukawa Shunshō, one of the foremost ukiyo-e artists of the time. In 1804 he became famous as an artist when, during a festival in Edo (later named Tokyo), he completed a 240m² painting of a Buddhist monk named Daruma. In 1814, he published the first of fifteen volumes of sketches entitled Manga. His Thirty- six Views of Mount Fuji, from which The Great Wave comes, was produced from .  Precursors  From the sixteenth century fantastic depictions of waves crashing on rocky shores were painted on folding screens known as \\"rough seas screens\\" (ariso byōbu). Hokusai drew many waves throughout his career; the genesis of the Great Wave can be traced back over thirty years. The combination of wave and mountain was inspired by an oil painting by Shiba Kōkan, an artist strongly influenced by the Western art, particularly Dutch paintings, he had seen at Nagasaki, the only port open to foreigners in this period. Kōkan's A View of Seven-League Beach was executed in middle of 1796 and exhibited publicly at the Atago shrine in Shiba. Hokusai's print Springtime at Enoshima, which he contributed to The Willow Branch poetry anthology published in 1797, is clearly derived from Kōkan's work, although the wave in Hokusai's version rises noticeably higher. Closer compositionally to the Great Wave are two previous prints by Hokusai: Kanagawa-oki Honmoku no zu () and Oshiokuri Hato Tsusen no Zu, () Both works have subjects identical to the Great Wave: a sailboat and a rowboat respectively. In both precursor works, the subjects are in the midst of a storm, beneath a great wave that threatens to devour them. An analysis of the differences between the two works and the Great Wave demonstrates the artistic and technical development of Hokusai: * In the earlier two designs the waves appear to be dense and uniform; they almost seem to be minerals. Their rigidity and verticality evoke the shape of a snow-capped mountain, while in the Great Wave the wave stands out because it is more active, dynamic, and aggressive, which makes it threatening. * The earlier images are very marked by the perspective traditionally used in Japanese painting, where the viewer sees the scene from a bird's-eye view. The Great Wave, on the other hand, is depicted in a more western perspective, giving the feeling that the wave will break on top of the viewer. * In the earlier prints the horizon is in the middle, whereas in the Great Wave the horizon is so low that it forces the viewer's eye to the very center of the action. * In the first two, there is a sail boat on the crest of the wave, as if it had managed to escape. Hokusai eliminated this element for the Great Wave, because it interfered with the dynamic of the curve or to make the image more dramatic. * The two first prints have an uneven composition, lacking consistency, whereas the Great Wave only has two important masses: the wave itself, and the vanishing point beneath the wave. * The wave shows the level of control that Hokusai had reached. The image, although simple in its design is, however, the result of a long process, a methodical reflection. The basis of this method were laid out by Hokusai in his 1812 work Quick lessons of simplified drawing, in which he explains that every object can be drawn using the relationship of the circle and square.  Image  = Description = This print is a yoko-e, that is, a landscape format produced to the ōban size, about high by wide. The composition comprises three main elements: the sea whipped up by a storm, three boats and a mountain. It includes the signature in the upper left-hand corner.  The mountain  The mountain with a snow-capped peak is Mount Fuji, which in Japan is considered sacred and a symbol of national identity, as well as a symbol of beauty. Mount Fuji is an iconic figure in many Japanese representations of famous places (meisho-e), as is the case in Hokusai's series of Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji, which opens with the present scene. The dark color around Mount Fuji seems to indicate that the scene occurs early in the morning, with the sun rising from behind the observer, illuminating the mountain's snowy peak. While cumulonimbus storm clouds seem to be hanging in the sky between the viewer and Mount Fuji, no rain is to be seen either in the foreground scene or on Mount Fuji, which itself appears completely cloudless.  Boats  In the scene there are three oshiokuri-bune, fast boats that are used to transport live fish. from the Izu and Bōsō peninsulas to the markets of the bay of Edo. As the name of the piece indicates the boats are in Kanagawa prefecture, with Tokyo to the north, Mount Fuji to the northwest, the bay of Sagami to the south and the bay of Tokyo to the east. The boats, oriented to the southeast, are returning to the capital. There are eight rowers per boat, clinging to their oars. There are two more passengers in the front of each boat, bringing the total number of human figures in the image to thirty. Using the boats as reference, one can approximate the size of the wave: the oshiokuri-bune were generally between long, and noting that Hokusai stretched the vertical scale by 30%, the wave must be between tall.  Sea and waves  The sea dominates the composition as an extending wave about to break. In the moment captured in this image, the wave forms a circle around the center of the design, framing Mount Fuji in the background. Edmond de Goncourt described the wave in this way: Andreas Ramos, a writer, notes:  Signature  Hokusai's signature The Great Wave off Kanagawa has two inscriptions. The first, within a rectangular cartouche in the top-left corner is the series title: \\"\\" Fugaku Sanjūrokkei / Kanagawa oki / nami ura, which translates as \\"Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji / Offshore from Kanagawa / Beneath the wave\\". The second inscription, to the left, is the artist's signature: Hokusai aratame Iitsu hitsu, (\\"From the brush of Hokusai, changing his name to Iitsu\\"). Over his career, Hokusai used more than 30 different names, always beginning a new cycle of works by changing it, and letting his students use the previous name. In his work Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji he used four distinct signatures, changing it according to the phase of the work: Hokusai aratame Iitsu hitsu, zen Hokusai Iitsu hitsu, Hokusai Iitsu hitsu and zen saki no Hokusai Iitsu hitsu.  Technique  Block used to produce woodblock prints In Japanese woodblock printing the artist's final preparatory sketch (shita-e) is taken to a horishi, or block carver, who glues the thin washi paper to a block of wood, usually cherry, and then carefully carves it away to form a relief of the lines of the image. In the process, the drawing is lost. Finally, with all the necessary blocks (usually one for each color), a surishi, or printer, places the printing paper on each block consecutively and rubs the back with a hand- tool known as a baren. There could be a great number of impressions produced, sometimes thousands, before the blocks wore out. Because of the nature of the production process, the final work was usually the result of a collaboration in which the painter generally did not participate in the production of the prints. The design uses only a small number of different color blocks. The water is rendered with three shades of blue; the boats are yellow; a dark grey for the sky behind Fuji and on the boat immediately below; a pale grey in the sky above Fuji and on the foreground boat; pink clouds at the top of the image. \\"The block for these pink clouds seems to have been slightly abraded along parts of the edge to give a subtle gradated effect (ita-bokashi)\\".Clark (2001) Even though no law of intellectual property existed in Japan before the Meiji era, there was still a sense of ownership and rights with respect to the blocks from which the prints were produced. Rather than belonging to the artist, the blocks were considered the property of the hanmoto (publisher) or honya (publisher/bookseller) who could do with them as he wished. In some cases the blocks were sold or transferred to other publishers, in which case they became known as kyūhan. Impressions A later impression from the original run of the Great Wave with characteristic darker sky. British Museum (1937,0710,0.147) Given that the series was very popular when it was produced, printing continued until the woodblocks started to show significant wear. It is likely that the original woodblocks printed around 5,000 copies. Because many original impressions have been lost, in wars, earthquakes, fires and other natural disasters, few early impressions survive in which the lines of the woodblocks were still sharp at the time of printing. The remaining prints and subsequent reproductions vary considerably in quality and condition. Later originals typically have a darker grey sky, and can be identified by a break in the line of the wave behind the boat on the right. The highest price paid for a Great Wave print in a public sale is $471,000 in March 2019. Hokusai's auction record is nearly $1.5 million as of 2012. The print owned by the British Museum cost £130,000 in 2008 and is only on display for six months every five years to prevent fading. Outside Japan original impressions of the print are in many Western collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, and Claude Monet's home in Giverny, France.  Influence  The print is one of the most reproduced and most instantly recognized artworks in the world. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Japan ended a long period of national isolation and became open to imports from the West. In turn, much Japanese art came to Europe and America and quickly gained popularity. The influence of Japanese art on Western culture became known as Japonism. Japanese woodblock prints became a source of inspiration for artists in many genres, particularly the Impressionists. Hokusai was seen as the emblematic Japanese artist and images from his prints and books influenced many different works. * Vincent van Gogh, a great admirer of Hokusai, praised the quality of drawing and use of line in the Great Wave, and said it had a terrifying emotional impact. * French sculptor Camille Claudel's La Vague (1897) replaces the boats in Hokusai's Great Wave with sea-nymphs. * The image inspired Claude Debussy's orchestral work, La mer, and appeared on the cover of the score's first edition published by A. Durand & Fils in 1905. *The Big Wave (1948) by Pearl Buck *The Killing Sea, a novel by Richard Lewis, has cover-art depicting an inspired wave, based on Hokusai's work.

Wervicq-Sud is one of the oldest villages still existant, dating back to Roman times. The town is separated from its Belgian Flemish sister town of Wervik by the Lys River. Located 15 km north of Lille and 20 km south of Ypres. Bounding communes *Comines, west *Bousbecque, east *Linselles, south History The name appears in the form Viroviacum in the Antonine Itinerary and the Peutinger map of settlements in the 3rd century. It was here that the Roman road from Tournai to Cassel crossed the Lys (a tributary of the Scheldt). It had a fortified post, of which traces are still visible. It was mentioned by Sanderus in his \\"Flandria illustrata\\" in the sixteenth century. For centuries, Werviq-Sud and Wervik were one unified settlement and belonged to the County of Flanders, an autonomous but tributary principality to French kings. In 1527 by the Treaty of Madrid it passed under the suzerainty of the Spanish empire. The town was during the sixteenth century the main centre of tobacco production in Europe. It remained dependent on Spain until Louis XIV's conquest in 1667. Subsequently the town passed on to Austrian Empire then back to French. It wasn't until 1713 that Werviq-Sud was finally separated from Wervik when the Treaty of Utrecht led to the river Lys becoming a border splitting the French and Austrian territories in this area. The town's left bank become a part of the Nord department under the name Wervicq-Sud in 1790. There was a small uprising here after the 1830 Belgian Revolution. Locals, together with those in nearby Bousbecque and a small number from Comines, demanded reunification with their Belgian counterparts on the other side of the Lys. This ended after an intervention of the Gendarmes. During World War I the town was occupied by the Germans. In World War II it was integrated into the Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France and reunited with its Belgian counterpart Wervik. =Heraldry= Population Economy Numerous associations located on a local way.

The first Château de Challeau was a fortified building built in the 11th century to 12th century. It has a 6m high and 1.3m thick curtain wall which surrounds an area approximately 30m by 24m, with rounded watchtowers at the corners. Unusually, it did not have a central keep, and internal buildings seem to have been limited to temporary shelters. It was modified in the 15th century, during the Hundred Years War. After the French Revolution, it was confiscated as a bien national and sold to Guillot de Blancheville. It was recovered by the descendants of its original owners in 1937, and restored. The second Château was built near Fontainebleau in 1540s, for Anne de Pisseleu, duchesse d'Étampes, mistress of Francis I of France, to a design by Pierre Chambiges. Chambiges later created the first Château de la Muette to a similar design. Anne de Pisseleu's niece, Marguerite Hurault, sold Dormelles and Challeau to Pierre Le Charron, a courtier of King Henry IV, in the 17th century, and it was altered to become the home of Gabrielle d'Estrées (for Voltaire composed his poem La Henriade). Louis XIII later permitted Claude Le Charron to commemorate his term as French ambassador at the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome by renaming the castle as the Château de Saint-Ange. The Château was destroyed in 1803, and a new building was later built in the grounds, also known as the Château de Saint-Ange. The park around the ruins was given protected status in 1951.

The forum was a prominent fixture for the leading pioneer settlers during its brief existence. It would begin publishing the first American newspaper west of the Rocky Mountains in 1846 and had several names during its existence. Founding One source lists the founding of the institution as 1844, but this is unlikely as there are many references to debates regarding forming a government in 1842. The forum was likely started at that time with the goal of producing a newspaper in the region. That paper, the Oregon Spectator, began publishing in 1846. The Lyceum's first meeting was held at the home of Sidney Moss who had purchased his land in Oregon City from Dr. John McLoughlin of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). Frederick Prigg was another member of the Lyceum that assisted in building the organization. So was Portland co-founder Francis Pettygrove. In addition to debates on government and the creation of a press, the group discussed literary items, scientific pursuits, and other local issues. Literary works of the group were published in the Spectator.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956.

Smith, Joseph Watt, Frank Ermatinger, Albert E. Wilson, Jacob Hoover, John Minto, Barton Lee, and John P. Brooks. Government debate Beginning in the fall and winter of 1840-1841 the members of the Lyceum debated the future of the region. At the time neither the United States nor Great Britain could claim the Oregon Country under the terms of the Treaty of 1818 signed at the conclusion of the War of 1812. During these debates in Oregon City the European settlers argued about whether an independent country should be formed, or if a provisional government should be formed. Those lyceum members advocating an independent country were mainly British, including Dr. McLoughlin and his HBC employees. Although many former fur trappers (predominately French-Canadian Roman Catholics) and the region's Jesuit missionaries sided with McLoughlin on this issue. Both groups viewed the formation of an independent country as preventing the territory from eventually becoming a part of the United States. McLoughlin's attorney L. W. Hastings, introduced a resolution on his behalf to the Lyceum as follows: > Resolved, That it is expedient for the settlers of the coast to organize an > independent government. The resolution was adopted but at that same meeting George Abernethy of the Methodist Mission introduced a competing issue following the vote to be discussed the next week. This new resolution was in essence in favor of waiting for the United States to annex the territory instead: > Resolved, That if the United States extends its jurisdiction over this > country during the next four years it will not be expedient to form an > independent government. After debate of the issues, (which by now, according to later observers, included the option of no provisional government if an independent nation was not formed) the resolution in favor of a four-year delay passed and ultimately the side favoring America prevailed. Later years It is not known when the Oregon Lyceum disbanded, but the Lyceum movement in the United States died out around the turn of the Twentieth Century.

DCA was used on mainframe and iSeries systems, and formed the basis of DisplayWrite's file format. DCA was later extended as MO:DCA (Mixed Object Document Content Architecture), which added embedded data files, like graphics. The original purpose of DCA was to provide a common document format that could be used across multiple IBM word processing platforms–such as the IBM PC, IBM mainframes, the Displaywriter dedicated word processor, and the IBM 5520 Administrative System. DCA defines two types of documents: * Revisable-Form Text (DCA/RFT) which is editable. * Final-Form Text (DCA/FFT) which is \\"formatted for a particular output device and cannot be changed.\\" Description DCA defines a data stream representing a document. MO:DCA is the wrapper or container for various objects that can make up the document. Each object is defined by its own subordinate architecture. The architectures are: * Presentation Text Object Content Architecture (PTOCA) describes formatted text, including text attributes such as font or color. * Image Object Content Architecture (IOCA) describes resolution-independent images. * Graphics Object Content Architecture (GOCA) describes vector graphic images. A variation of GOCA, AFP GOCA, is used in Advanced Function Presentation environments. * Bar Code Object Content Architecture (BCOCA) describes bar codes in a number of different formats. * Font Object Content Architecture (FOCA) describes fonts to be used in the document * Color Management Object Content Architecture (CMOCA) describes required color management information. Each architecture uses a series of binary structured fields to describe its corresponding object. Revisable- Form Text Revisable-Form Text (abbreviated RFT or RFT-DCA) is part of DCA. It is sometimes referred to as Revisable Format Text. It was used by IBM DisplayWrite 4 and 5 word processors on System/360 and 370 mainframe computers, and OfficeVision/400 to allow transfer of formatted documents to other systems. RFT has a counterpart Final-Form Text (abbreviated FFT or FFT- DCA), which was not intended to be editable and was output-only. History The drive to initiate international standards for the DCAs was initiated in 1980 at the IBM Rochester facility. The team consisting of two MODCA architects, an RTOCA architect, and a PTOCA architect was assembled. These architects as they were called were responsible for bringing together the IBM consensus for the design of the data streams and to take the work into the international standards arena. There was a concerted effort to bring the international community into the development. This decision was based in part on the experience gained over the acceptance of GML into an international SGML standard. To avoid the long delay of creating the architecture, they wanted to get everyone involved early. SGML http://www.sgmlsource.com/standardization had taken many years and man-hours to develop. IBMs work with document content had been pushed by the needs of main frame computers where GML and DCA were in use, but that experience was pointing to a need for standardized component architectures for revisable and non-revisable text in particular. In 1981, shortly after its inception, the group was moved along with the IBM 5280 Distributed Data System to IBM Austin near Round Rock, TX, where the work continued with mixed success. As the architectures were becoming more firmly positioned on the international stage, the team was moved again in 1987 to The IBM Dallas Programming Center near Roanoke, Texas (Westlake), where in 1998 it was disbanded and the work discontinued on the DCA architectures due mainly to the pc-community which had gone in a different direction of necessity. The DCA architectures were fully completed, but not totally agreed upon in the details after 18 years. And there were no active implementations in sight. The world of the PC had decided on HTML (believed to be an application of the SGML international standard) and used portions of it for their purposes, Microsoft Word eventually used the similar datastream for the internal working datastream for storage of editable content. Even though the SGML standard was available, it was impractical for the full SGML parser implementation to be useful so a potential subset of it became the de facto standard for revisable text used today in the pc arena. At about the same time Adobe Systems designed and produced the printable document encoding called PDF which has become the standard for PC-produced printable documents. The international standard was set in 2008 without any input from anyone except the users who decided to use the products offered in greater numbers than the managers of the data stream architects had ever dreamed possible. The decision was driven by the need for the product and the solution found was far more acceptable than the standards committees could design as a standard in the time frame in which the decision was needed. Over 10 years of work had not produced the acceptable method and the pc-computing community created what they needed in less time. Attempting to achieve a consensus document data stream was quickly out-flanked by the available and usable content provided by the companies who did not attempt to share with others, but created a workable solution and sold it to users - and they liked it. So the output of the word processing software is 'printed' into the PDF format provided by the most used presentation product. That is, for example, Microsoft Word provides a printer selection 'Microsoft Print to PDF' in order to produce the requisite output for a PDF document - a very acceptable solution for most users. A similar method could have been used to produce the international standard had one eventually arrived. When IBM disbanded its Dallas Programming Center in 1998, the entire staff of architects retired and left the company except the manager who was moved to another location and another position, ending the DCA architecture project for the foreseeable future at IBM.

Founded in 1935,Miami University Marching Band History . Accessed 2007-05-26. the band is an organization which fields 270 students enrolled in the Miami University system. The band is a part of the College of Creative Arts and the Department of Music, representing the students of the college at all home football games, as well as at various away games, bowl games, parades, and marching band festivals. History The Miami University Marching Band was formed in 1935 by A.D. Lekvold, the first director of bands from 1936 to 1960. Their first uniforms consisted of white trousers, red capes, and red coats. During the 1950s, the band fielded 96 members and would take annual road trips to Bowling Green State University, Ohio University, and the University of Cincinnati. Additionally, around this time the Shakerettes, drill team, and majorettes first appeared. Under Nicholas Poccia, the band was enlarged from 96 to 144 students. Over 200 people were involved as either a field marcher or an alternate. The late 60's brought the marching band new uniforms consisting of blue uniforms with a big 'M' on the front and an Indian on the back. In 1971, the Miami Marching Machine came into existence. The Marching Machine was built by Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma, and was a birthday gift to Mr. Poccia from the marching band. The Marching Machine was a tank-like structure placed over Dr. Clay, the Tuba instructor's, Volkswagen, and it became the mascot of the band. It was always at the head of all the parades and even made an appearance at a Cincinnati Bengals game. The Marching Machine remained an integral part of the marching band until 1979. In 1978, Dr. Jack Liles became director of the band. Dr. Liles made a significant impact on the style of marching the band would use. MUMB adapted the current drum corps style, in contrast to the prior dance style of marching. The color guard and front pit were introduced to the band, keeping with current trends in marching bands around the nation. The 1980s were a huge growth period for the band, not only in quantity, but quality. In 1999, Mr. David Shaffer was appointed director of the marching band. During Mr. Shaffer's tenure as director, the Marching Band performed at the 2003 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and 2 Football Bowl games. In 2009, he was succeeded by Dr. Stephen Lytle, who led the band in performances with jazz legend Benny Golson as well as appearances in the 2010 Frozen Four, the 2010 MAC Football Championship, the 2011 GoDaddy.com Bowl, the 2011 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, the 57th Presidential Inaugural Parade, and the 2016 St. Petersburg Bowl. Dr. Brooke Johnson was appointed interim director in 2018 and gained the position of Director of Athletic Bands in 2019. Instrumentation The Miami University Marching Band performing a halftime show on September 7, 2002 at Yager Stadium in Oxford. The Miami University Marching Band consists of about 270 members, featuring brass, woodwinds, battery, and a pit percussion section. Baton twirlers, a color guard, and a dance team (called the Shakerettes) also perform with the band. =Directors= *A.D.

It features fully shutter-priority automatic exposure and fully manual shooting modes. The Canonet G-III is the third generation of Canonet, following the original Canonet and the New Canonet. The G-III features a 40 mm 1.7 with six elements in four groups. The integrated lightmeter provides shutter priority and manual modes. The sensor is located on the forward part of the lens, which allows use of filters without manual compensation of exposure. The Canonet can use standard flashes, or the Canolite D which was custom-designed for the Canonet.  Exposure meter  The exposure meter uses a PX625 mercury battery, which is now discontinued. The alkaline equivalent can be used, but the different voltage, different discharge curve, and absence of voltage regulation circuit cause incorrect metering that results in between 1.5-f-stop underexposure at the beginning of the life of the alkaline battery and 1.5-f-stop overexposure at the end. Furthermore, the mercury battery has a life span of several years, compared to a few months for the alkaline battery. This degree of incorrect exposure is tolerable with negative colour or black-and-white films, but is more noticeable with slide films. Many users will use a 1.4-volt hearing aid battery or adapters with Schottky diodes that allow use of SR-44 battery with better results. A zinc-air replacement battery can also be used. This battery has the same voltage as the PX625 mercury battery, and therefore is seen as a viable replacement by many. The G-III camera made checking the battery easier by the addition of the battery check button on the side of the viewfinder eyepiece. A lamp on the camera would light when the battery was still good.

She was the first car/passenger ferry to operate between Helsinki and Stockholm, and the first ship to offer year-round service. She was later known under the names MS Rogalin, MS Edda and MS Celtic Pride. She was scrapped in 2004 in Aliağa, Turkey. MS Aallotar In 1970 the Finnish shipping company Oy Siljavarustamo - Siljarederiet Ab ordered two new carferries for Helsinki-Stockholm service from the French Dubegion-Normandie S.A. shipyard. During construction of the ships Silja's operations were reorganised, and the building contract for the first ship was transferred to Finland Steamship Company (FÅA). On 23 July 1971 the ship was christened MS Aallotar. She was delivered to FÅA on 17 February 1972, and on 29 February she was set in Silja Line traffic between Helsinki and Stockholm, becoming the first car/passenger ferry to operate on the route, and the first to operate the service around the year. In June she was joined in the route by her brand-new sister . In December 1972 she collided with a Swedish ice breaker in the Stockholm archipelago, but was spared serious damage. The new ships proved the Helsinki-Stockholm route to be highly lucrative, and by 1973 Silja Line's owner companies decided to order three larger ferries to replace the Aallotar and Svea Regina, to be delivered in 1975, so the groundbreaking Aallotar's service on the route was to be short. On 7 August 1973 the Aallotar was chartered for a special cruise around the Porkkala archipelago for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. On 7 July 1975, after delivery of the new , the Aallotar was transferred to Turku-Mariehamn-Norrtälje service. She proved unprofitable on this freight-oriented line, and in August 1976 the Aallotar was laid up, waiting for a potential buyer. No buyer was found however, and between June and August 1977 the Aallotar was back in active service, sailing between Turku and Stockholm. After this she was again laid up, but only for a short while as in October 1977 she was chartered to Polferries, who set her on traffic between Helsinki and Gdańsk, Poland, without a change of name. MS Rogalin, MS Edda, MS Celtic Pride The Rogalin after the 1979 crash, in Stockholm harbour On 14 May 1978 Polferries bought the Aallotar from FÅA and renamed her MS Rogalin after a renowned village in Greater Poland. During the next four years she was used on the routes Helsinki-Gdańsk, Ystad-Świnoujście and Copenhagen-Świnoujście. In September 1979 the Rogalin collided with the Dutch tanker Coral Rubrum outside Porkkala. In May 1982 the Rogalin was transferred to Copenhagen-Travemünde service. In May 1983 the Rogalin was chartered to the Icelandic company Faraskip until September of the same year. She was renamed M/S Edda and set in traffic between Reykjavík, Newcastle and Bremerhaven. After the charter ended she reverted to her old name and was again set in Polferries traffic. On 31 December 1985 she made a special cruise from Szczecin to London. Between May and December 1987, and again between May and December 1988, the Rogalin was chartered to Swansea Cork Ferries for service between Swansea and Cork under the name MS Celtic Pride. Between the charters she returned again to the name Rogalin and was used in Polferries traffic. In March 1991 she was chartered to Swansea Cork Ferries for the third time, again under the name Celtic Pride. Tragedy struck in August 1992 when two teenagers, a brother and sister, died in their cabin en route to Cork. They had been overcome by fumes, traced to an alteration that had been made to the venting system in a septic tank. It proved impossible to determine where and when the alteration had been made. The charter ended in November 1992, and once again the ship returned to Polferries traffic under the name Rogalin. After this she was at least occasionally used on the route Gdańsk-Nynäshamn. In July 1999 the Rogalin was reflagged to the Bahamas. From November 2002 onwards she was used only on the route Ystad-Świnoujście. In July 2003 the 31-year-old ferry was taken out of service, laid up and put for sale. In October she was sold to Indian shipbreakers and on 25 November she arrived in Alang, India where she was scrapped.

Early years and education Victor Efosa Uwaifo was born in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria, and obtained his secondary school education at the Western Boys' High School Benin and St Gregory's College, Lagos, from 1957 to 1961. He began playing guitar when he was 12 years old, his earliest popular music influences being records of Spanish and Latin American music. He studied graphics at Yaba College of Technology, Lagos and graduated in 1961–63. He received a bachelor's degree with first-class honours and a master's degree from the University of Benin in 1994, where he studied fine and applied arts and majored in sculpture and a Ph.D in Applied Arts (Architectural Sculpture) Thesis: A reinvention of Benin Royal Ancestral Pieces 2018, University of Benin Musical career After leaving Benin, Uwaifo continued playing music at St Gregory's, Lagos. He was a contemporary of Segun Bucknor, and they were both among the leading Lagos high school bandleaders. During school holidays and weekends, he jammed with Olaiya's All Stars band. After completing secondary school studies, he played with E.C. Arinze's highlife during late hours. Uwaifo also briefly worked with Stephen Osadebe and Fred Coker before he formed Melody Maestros in 1965. The band released \\"Joromi\\" which became a hit in Nigeria and other parts of West Africa. Uwaifo made history in Nigeria when he won the first Golden record in Nigeria, West Africa and Africa (presented by Philips, West Africa) for his song \\"Joromi\\" in 1996. Between 1965 and 1968, he developed the Akwete rhythm sound. In 1969, he launched a new beat called Shadow accompanied by a new dance also called shadow, a mixture of Akwete and twist. The sound was released when soul music was popular in Lagos and lasted a few years. After the launch of Shadow, the Melody Maestros went on tour of various Nigerian cities. Uwaifo later experimented with a new rhythm that was similar to soul but soon left it for Ekassa, an interpretation of a traditional Benin sound. In 1971, Uwaifo opened the Joromo Hotel in Benin City, and within ten years established his own television studio. From there he produced a national weekly music and culture programme. Uwaifo, who has a total of 12 golden records to date, has travelled to many countries, including the United States, Russia, Japan, United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, France, Hungary, Rome, Ghana, Côte d'Ivoire, Togo, Benin Republic, Spain, and Canada.

He is a Justice of the Peace and has served in many capacities. Uwaifo was also appointed as the Honorable Commissioner of Arts, Culture and Tourism and Member of the State Executive Council, the highest policy-making decision body in Edo State, 2001–03.

History The Bayers Lake Industrial Park was developed from the mid-1980s, and was served by CN Rail's Chester Subdivision rail line running from Halifax to Yarmouth as well as Highway 102 and Highway 103. Some of the earliest developments were the Nova Scotia Liquor Commission head office and distribution centre and the Volvo Halifax Assembly, both constructed in 1987. The industrial park began a transition into a business/retail park in the early 1990s. The first major development occurred when the United States warehouse store chain Price Club (currently a Costco) established a retail store on a westward extension of Lacewood Drive which was called Chain Lakes Drive. Additional big box development followed with the establishment of a Kent Building Supplies, followed by a Kmart (subsequently redeveloped as a Zellers, then a Target, now a Canadian Tire), and an Atlantic Superstore. The popularity of the new retail outlets at Bayers Lake Industrial Park, or \\"BLIP\\" as it was popularly referred to by locals, was apparent. Further development occurred when Empire Theatres selected Bayers Lake for the establishment of the largest theatre multiplex in Atlantic Canada (17 screens + 1 IMAX); the multiplex is currently operated by Cineplex Entertainment. The multiplex development led to an expansion in restaurants and other retail outlets. Bayers Lake Business Park presently occupies over and is mostly retail with a declining manufacturing and logistics presence. The property is administered by the Halifax Regional Municipality. Transportation The business park is located at the junction of two major highways; Highway 102 and Highway 103. The park is approximately 10 kilometres from Downtown Halifax. An abandoned Canadian National Railway line runs through the park as a rail trail. The park is also serviced by Halifax Transit buses: 21 Timberlea, 28 Bayers Lake, and 123 Timberlea (rush hour only at St. Margarets Bay Rd and Lakelands Blvd).

Background On 24 February 1966, a military coup took place, with the military of Ghana overthrowing the Convention People's Party (CPP) government of the Republic of Ghana's first President, Kwame Nkrumah. The ruling military government dubbed itself the National Liberation Council (NLC), and Kotoka, as General Officer Commanding the Ghana Armed Forces, was a key figure in the Council.Ogunbiyi, Tokunbo: Forty Years After 'Operation Guitar Boy', and the Nigerian Connection, Nigeriaworld, April 17, 2007. Guitar Boy The attempted counter-coup against the NLC was instigated by three junior officers of the Ghana Armed Forces: Lt. Samuel Arthur, Lt. Moses Yeboah and 2nd Lt. Osei-Poku. With the support of several senior officers, including Warrant Officer George Ofosu, and 119 soldiers of the 2nd Recce (Reconnaissance) Regiment, the coup-makers plotted to overthrow the NLC government. The operation was named \\"Guitar Boy\\", after a popular song by Nigerian musician Victor Uwaifo, in which the West African water goddess, the Mami Wata, had given him a guitar and asked him to make good music. After the attempted coup, \\"Guitar Boy\\" was banned by the NLC from radio airplay in Ghana. Lt. Gen. Kotoka was shot and killed by Lt. Yeboah at Ghana International Airport. The airport was later renamed Kotoka International Airport in honour of the General, and the spot on which he was killed now houses a life-size memorial statue. Lt. Arthur attempted to gain access to the ammunition depot of the 1st Recce Regiment. In a struggle for the keys, Captain Avevor – the depot's quartermaster – was shot and killed. For their role in the deaths, Yeboah and Arthur were executed by firing squad at a military range near Labadi Beach. The other conspirator, Osei-Poku, received a thirty-year prison sentence, and the other members of the regiment also received prison terms. Aftermath Although the Guitar Boy coup was ultimately unsuccessful, it was considered that it had led to the eventual downfall of the NLC government, due to increasing rifts caused by the assassination of Kotoka who had been a stabilising influence in the military government. Some Nkrumaists claimed that Arthur's abortive coup was aimed at restoring the deposed President Kwame Nkrumah and his Convention People's Party. However, Ofosu-Appiah's biography of Kotoka indicates something different, for Arthur was reported to have said that he wanted to be the first subaltern to have staged a successful military coup in Africa (Life of Kotoka, pp. 117-137).

Saint- Hubert was originally intended as a simple hunting lodge, to allow the King to rest during and after the hunt without calling on his cousin, the duc de Penthièvre. Work was not completed by 1756, and it was decided to turn Saint- Hubert into a full château, with a main building housing 25 nobles, plus two projecting service wings and a gatehouse creating a courtyard. The main room was elaborately decorated with painted stucco. The building was still not completed by the death of Louis XV, and Louis XVI abandoned it as too expensive. Instead, he bought the Château de Rambouillet from the duc de Penthièvre. Saint-Hubert then fell into disrepair and was demolished in 1855. Little remains today.

Adkins was regarded as top in his field and a world authority on the hydrogenation of organic compounds.Genealogy Database: Homer Adkins Adkins is known for his wartime work, where he experimented with chemical agents and poisonous gasses. Renowned for his work, Adkins eventually suffered a series of heart attacks and died in 1949. Early life and work Adkins was born on January 16, 1892, in Newport, Ohio, the son of Emily (née Middleswart) and Alvin Adkins. He grew up on a farm with his brother and sister. After attending and finishing high school in Newport, he entered Denison University. Having a reputation as a tall and shy boy, Adkins graduated in three and a half years. Adkins then spent three years at Ohio State University. He took his Master's degree in 1916, and his Ph.D. in 1918, under the direction of William Lloyd Evans. After receiving his degree, he began work as a research chemist for the United States Department of War. In the following academic year, Adkins served as an instructor in organic chemistry at Ohio State University and in the summer of 1919 he was a research chemist with E. I. Du Pont De Nemours and Company. In 1919, Adkins came to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He remained there each year until his death in 1949, except for two summers he spent working in industry at the Bakelite Corporation in 1924, and 1926 and for responsibilities from 1942 to 1945 as administrator and research director in the war program of the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development. Adkins was a lecturer to graduate students in a course entitled \\"Survey of Organic Chemistry,\\" but he also kept contact with students in elementary and continued for most of the time to give lectures in the first course in organic chemistry. In 1919, Adkins began his thesis on the rates of oxidation by potassium permanganate of acetaldehyde, oxalic acid and the rates of reactions having to do with different additions of temperature and molarity. His overall interest was the nature of the intermediate of these reactions. Soon after, he wrote a second paper concerning reaction rates and a third involving the catalytic addition of oxides on esters. His whole research began to revolve around the nature of a product resulting from a reaction depending on the catalyst given. The study on catalysts led to his most important contribution, the hydrogenation of an ester to an alcohol with the use of a copper chromite catalyst. After the study on copper chromite, Adkins delved further and further into hydrogenation reactions and the use of catalysts. A new reaction came out of his research in which hydrogen is added to a double bond on a catalytic surface, the given molecule then splits off into two separate molecules. Adkins published many books on top of his position as a lecturer and successful researcher. He published his most recognizable book, “Reactions of Hydrogen”, referring to his extensive studies and pioneering of Hydrogenation. He also co-published many of the books students in Organic Chemistry classes studied with. A widely known textbook, “Elementary Organic Chemistry” was co-written by Adkins and published by McGraw-Hill Book Company. World War II Throughout World War II, Adkins focused his research on wartime necessities. Many feared that poisonous gases would be used extensively in World War II as they had been during World War I. Adkins' laboratory at Wisconsin engaged in chemical warfare research. Classified documents at the time revealed Adkins and his colleagues describing their research on agents to produce blistering, vomiting, tearing and sneezing. Adkins also studied the removal of the effects of poison agents by using multiple different kinds of chemicals and ointments, combined with protective clothing for soldiers. Due to the magnitude and effect of his work, Adkins was a recipient of the Medal for Merit in 1948 for his wartime studies. Adkins was a world authority on the hydrogenation of organic compounds and he developed the Adkins catalyst partly based on interrogation of German chemists after World War II in relation to the Fischer-Tropsch process. Adkins also coined the word hydrogenolysis to describe the chemical reaction in which a molecule is broken into smaller molecules by the reaction of hydrogen. He developed the Adkins-Peterson reaction with Wesley J. Peterson. Later life and death While he was a graduate student at the Ohio State University, Adkins married Louise Spivey, who was a classmate of his at Denison and who was teaching high school mathematics. The pair had three children: Susanne, Nance, and Roger. He had three grandchildren from Susanne. Adkins enjoyed leisure activities, such as golfing, as he found it was relaxing and he needed the exercise. Teaching, maintaining a large research program, and war time pressure took a heavy toll on Adkins' strength. While playing a game of golf in the late spring of 1949, Adkins suffered a minor heart attack. He concluded that as soon as he had the chance to get treatment, he would. After a meeting with other interested chemists regarding his research, Adkins suffered a larger heart attack and was hospitalized for roughly a month. Adkins' condition seemed to improve, so he was sent home. His health suddenly again began failing rapidly. Weakened and bed-ridden, Adkins died on August 12, 1949. Awards and honours During his lifetime, Adkins received many honors. He received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Denison University, his alma mater, in 1938. President Harry S. Truman awarded Adkins with the Medal for Merit. In 1942, Adkins was accepted as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. =Legacy= After his death, Adkins' many former students and friends founded the Homer Adkins Fellowship, which supported a graduate student in chemistry at the University of Wisconsin. President Edwin B. Fred of the University of Wisconsin said, \\"He was recognized as one of the leading chemists that America has produced. He was the kind of man who makes a University distinguished.\\" President James B. Conant of Harvard said, \\"the academic world has suffered an irreparable loss.\\" References ; Notes ; Bibliography * * External links *http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/Web_Genealogy/Info/adkinshb.pdf *http://books.nap.edu/html/biomems/hadkins.pdf *National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir Category:1892 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Organic chemists Category:Denison University alumni Category:Ohio State University alumni Category:Medal for Merit recipients Category:People from Washington County, Ohio Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences ","title":"Homer Burton Adkins"},{"id":"9472178","text":"Three regiments of the British Army have been numbered the 87th Regiment of Foot: *87th Regiment of Foot (Keith's Highlanders), a British Army unit raised in 1759 and disbanded in 1763 *87th Regiment of Foot (1779), a British Army unit raised in 1779 and disbanded in 1783 *87th (Royal Irish Fusiliers) Regiment of Foot, a British Army unit raised in 1793 ","title":"87th Regiment of Foot (disambiguation)"},{"id":"9472197","text":"Divided Kingdom is a novel by British author Rupert Thomson. It was first published in Britain by Bloomsbury in April 2005 and then in the United States by Alfred A. Knopf in June 2005. Introduction The former United Kingdom has been divided into four Quarters: Green (Scotland, the North-East of England and East Anglia); Red (the East Midlands, the North-West of England and Northern Ireland); Blue (Wales and the West Country) and Yellow (the West Midlands), each allocated a different personality type. Each of these personality types is based upon a different Humor: Sanguine is blood, Choleric is yellow bile, Phlegmatic is phlegm and Melancholic is black bile. Each country has a different way of running things: for example, the Blue Quarter uses canals, and the Yellow Quarter is industrious. No one is allowed to go from quarter to quarter; there are walls with barbed wire and armed guards. The protagonist is Thomas Parry, a government official for the Sanguines. He attends a conference in the Blue Quarter and visits a club called the Bathysphere where he sees his life as it was before the division. This inspires him to go on a journey across all the quarters to find out about his past. Plot summary The story begins with Parry's younger self being whisked away from his bed and his family in the dead of night and loaded into a van occupied with others in the same situation. From there the story continues in Thorpe Hall, a place best described as a hostel for those yet to be arranged into their defining humor. Whilst staying at the Hall, the protagonist and his young companions begin to learn of their fate and of the 'Rearrangement'. Following a short time in the hall, the four humors are explained to the children, Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic. Shortly after, the protagonist is taken to see Mr. Reek, one of the teachers at Thorpe Hall. He is told that he will be moved to a new location where he will be integrated into a new family suited to a person of his type. He is also given his name, Thomas Parry, which is used for the majority of the remaining story. After a time, Thomas is transported via train to his new home where he meets his new father and sister, Victor and Marie Parry. During the remainder of his childhood, Thomas settles into his new environment easily, adopting the Sanguine attitude and persona. With his childhood drawing to a close, Thomas goes to attend University witnessing the slow deterioration of his adopted family as life after the rearrangement which took their mother/wife away from them wears them down. Towards the end of his time at university, Thomas is approached by Diana Bilal, an employee of the ministry of health and social security. She informs Thomas that he had been watched for some time and were interested in employing him as a trainee assessment officer. Thomas is initially reluctant to take her up on the offer, knowing that his adopted family would be disappointed as it was the ministry who they blamed for the loss of their mother and wife. Thomas is won over and accepts the job when Diana tells him that his family need not know of his true occupation and that they would be granted immunity from ever being rearranged again. Shortly after joining the Ministry, Thomas gets his first experience of participating in a rearrangement when a young girl is to be moved from sanguine territory (the red quarter) to choleric (the yellow quarter). During his time as an observer to the rearrangement, he gets his first view of a border gate, a complex of high concrete walls, barbed wire and minefields patrolled by border guards. After gaining his first view of the 'nuts and bolts' of the job, Thomas is visited by the head of the ministry of relocation Mr. Vishram. Upon being asked if he was available for lunch, Thomas agrees to meet the man the following day when Vishram would reveal Thomas's next job. The next day, Vishram takes Thomas to a small restaurant in the heart of the red light district to discuss an upcoming conference that Thomas would be attending. It is revealed that the conference was to be held in the Blue quarter. Realizing the chance to discover something entirely new and exciting, Thomas duly accepts. A few days later, Thomas finds himself stepping off of a train and into the Blue quarter, typified by its many canal systems that weave their way through the metropolis. As he walks through the city to get to his hotel, he is stopped by a man who forces a small leaflet into his hand saying you may find this interesting. Thomas then goes to the Sheraton and later meets Walter Ming, a mysterious character who asks Thomas if he's going to the \\"Bathysphere\\", which appears at first to be a club. Thomas then goes to the Bathysphere and a very confusing scene occurs. Thomas opens a pale gold door and suddenly he has a flashback of his entire life. After these flashbacks, his view of the Divided Kingdom has changed. The guests attending the conference at the Blue Quarter are moved into the Yellow Quarter for reasons that are not quite clear, possibly because it is Rearrangement Day. During the night a bomb goes off in the hotel and Thomas escapes determined to go back to the Bathysphere.

He collected and described new species of exotic butterflies, especially in Adalbert Seitz's Macrolepidoptera of the World. He is best known for his work on the butterflies of Java. His career began in 1888 when he spent two years in Brazil. The expedition was financially successful and led to his becoming a professional collector. Next he spent some time in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), then in 1890 he went to Java for three years, visiting Sumatra. Between 1895 and 1896 he collected in Sulawesi, Lombok and Bali. In 1899, he went on a three-year journey to the United States, Oceania, Japan, China, Tonkin, Annam and Siam, returning via India. Following his travels, he settled in Geneva where he wrote monographs based on the specimens in his extensive private collection. Many of these were incorporated into Seitz's work. In taxonomy he made extensive use of the structure of the male genitalia. Fruhstorfer, in these years also studied Palearctic butterflies, Orthoptera and botany. No longer travelling himself, Fruhstorfer employed the collectors in Formosa and Franz Werner in New Guinea. Fruhstorfer's collections are deposited at the Museum für Naturkunde in Berlin, the Natural History Museum in London and the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris,Laissus, Y. (2007).

One of the most famous wildlife of Iran is the critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), which today survives only in Iran. History The wildlife of Iran first been partly described by Hamdallah Mustawfi in the 14th century who only referred to animals. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin and Édouard Ménétries explored the Caspian Sea area and the Talysh Mountains to document Caspian fauna. Several naturalists followed in the 19th century, including Filippo de Filippi, William Thomas Blanford and Nikolai Zarudny who documented mammal, bird, reptile, amphibian and fish species. Flora More than one-tenth of the country is forested. The most extensive growths are found on the mountain slopes rising from the Caspian Sea, with stands of oak, ash, elm, cypress, and other valuable trees. On the plateau proper, areas of scrub oak appear on the best-watered mountain slopes, and villagers cultivate orchards and grow the plane tree, poplar, willow, walnut, beech, maple, and mulberry. Wild plants and shrubs spring from the barren land in the spring and afford pasturage, but the summer sun burns them away. According to FAO reports, the major types of forests that exist in Iran and their respective areas are: # Caspian forests of the northern districts (33,000 km2) # Limestone mountainous forests in the northeastern districts (Juniperus forests, 13,000 km2) # Pistachio forests in the eastern, southern and southeastern districts (26,000 km2) # Oak forests in the central and western districts (100,000 km2) # Shrubs of the Dasht-e Kavir districts in the central and northeastern part of the country (10,000 km2) # Sub-tropical forests of the southern coast (5,000 km2) like the Hara forests. More than 8,200 plant species are grown in Iran. The land covered by Iran's natural flora is four times that of the Europe's.

Ungulate species include wild boar, urial, Armenian mouflon, red deer, and goitered gazelle. Domestic ungulates are represented by sheep, goat, cattle, horse, water buffalo, donkey, and camel.

At least 74 species of Iranian wildlife are listed on the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a sign of serious threats to the country’s biodiversity. Majlis has been showing disregard for wildlife by passing laws and regulations such as the act that lets the Ministry of Industries and Mines (Iran) exploit mines without the involvement of the Department of Environment (Iran), and by approving large national development projects without demanding comprehensive study of their impact on wildlife habitats. A body of a leopard that was found near Zom village in the protected area of Kosalan and Shahu in 2019 The Persian leopard's main range overlaps with that of bezoar ibex, which occurs throughout Alborz and Zagros mountain ranges, as well as smaller ranges within the Iranian Plateau. The leopard population is very sparse, due to loss of habitat, loss of natural prey, and population fragmentation. Apart from bezoar ibex, wild sheep, boar, deer, and domestic livestock constitute leopard prey in Iran.Sanei, A., Zakaria, M., Hermidas, S. (2011).

Hernández was the first American civilian to be killed by military personnel while on duty in the United States since the 1970 Kent State shootings, and led to Secretary of Defense William Cohen issuing a temporary suspension of troop patrols near the U.S.–Mexico border. The shooting inspired the 2005 movie The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada by Tommy Lee Jones, and the 2007 documentary The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez. Death U.S. Marines Ronald Wieler Jr., Ray Torres Jr., James Matthew Blood, and their fire-team leader, San Francisco native Clemente Bañuelos (all between the ages of 19 and 22), on drug patrol and heavily camouflaged in ghillie suits came upon Hernández herding goats. The camouflaged Marines observed the 18-year-old high school student from concealment at a distance of approximately 200 yards maintaining radio contact with their unit. Hernández, who was carrying a .22 caliber rifle that family members said he used to fend off predators, shot in the direction of the Marines. Continuing to call for Border Patrol assistance, the Marines proceeded to track Hernández for 20 minutes, until Bañuelos shot and killed him, with the bullet entering the armpit on his right side. Investigation A congressional investigation into the killing was scheduled for September 1997. A grand jury examined the fatal shooting and considered criminal charges against the four Marines, but did not indict any of the Marines involved in the shooting. The Justice Department subsequently dropped its investigation. The Marine Corps also investigated the killing. In 1998, the U.S. government paid the Hernández family $1.9 million to settle a wrongful death claim. Clemente Bañuelos, the 22-year-old U.S. Marine who fatally shot Hernández was not charged. The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez The 2007 documentary The Ballad of Esequiel Hernandez explores his killing by Marines, analysing both sides of the issue. It won best-documentary awards at the Mexico City Film Festival and Santa Fe Film Festival in 2007 and at the El Paso festival in 2008. It is directed by Kieran Fitzgerald and narrated by Tommy Lee Jones. The documentary premiered July 8, 2008 on PBS.

Life Ruth Picardie was born on 1 May 1964 in Reading. She was the daughter of South African émigrés. She read Social Anthropology at King's College, Cambridge. She worked as an editor and journalist for The Guardian and The Independent newspapers in the UK. She also contributed to other publications, such as the New Statesman. Her memoir of living with breast cancer, Before I Say Goodbye, was published posthumously, culled from five columns written for the Observer's magazine Life, and from her personal correspondence. These were collected and edited by her husband, Matt Seaton and her sister, Justine Picardie. Picardie married Matt Seaton in Worthing, West Sussex in 1994. They had two children, twins Joe Louis and Lola May (born 1995, Lambeth). Seaton was a keen competitive cyclist and is the author of The Escape Artist, which concentrates on his love of amateur cycling but also chronicled his wife's struggle with breast cancer. Picardie died in Lambeth, London, aged 33. Her sister, Justine Picardie, with Beth Wagstaff (soon afterwards, another victim of the disease), established The Lavender Trust in her sister's memory. The Trust focuses on raising funds and support for younger women suffering from breast cancer. Picardie and Wagstaff's surgeon, Puvaneswary Markandoo, was subsequently found responsible for other misdiagnosis and negligence in surgical operations on women, and was removed from the medical register ('struck off') by the General Medical Council in December 2011.

Many of the larger mammals in the country are categorized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as globally threatened. These include the snow leopard, Marco Polo sheep, Siberian musk deer, markhor, urial, and the Asiatic black bear. Other species of interest are the ibex, the gray wolf, and the brown bear, striped hyenas, and numerous bird of prey species. Most of the Marco Polo sheep and ibex are being poached for food, whereas wolves, snow leopards and bears are being killed for damage prevention. A leopard was recorded by a camera-trap in Bamyan Province in 2011. The long-lasting conflict in the country badly affected both predator and prey species, so that the national population is considered to be small and severely threatened. Between 2004 and 2007, a total of 85 leopard skins were seen being offered in markets of Kabul. Contemporary records do not exist for any of the smaller cat species known to have been present in the country, all of which were threatened already in the 1970s by indiscriminate hunting, prey depletion and habitat destruction.

First published in Germany in 1835, the work is an exhaustive treatment of the subject, tracing the mythology and beliefs of the ancient Germanic peoples from their earliest attestations to their survivals in modern traditions, folktales and popular expressions. The structure of the Deutsche Mythologie is fairly encyclopaedic. The articles and chapters are discursive of philological, historical, folkloristic, and poetic aspects of the pre- Christian Germanic religions. The sources are varied epochally and geographically. In many instances, Grimm cites the North and West Germanic variants of a religious entity; thus the entry on Thor is titled 'Donar, Thunar (Thôrr)'. Older Germanic words, particularly those concerning ritual, are often compared to Latin equivalents, as evident in the table of contents. The English translation by Stallybrass (3 vols., with vol. 4, supplement), is based on the fourth edition.Stallybrass tr. Historiographical importance The Deutsche Mythologie was an influential study; it has been called 'seminal, and largely unsurpassed'.Alaric Hall, Elves in Anglo-Saxon England: Matters of Belief, Health, Gender and Identity, Anglo-Saxon Studies, 8 (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2007; pbk repr. 2009), p. 12.

Shippey, ed. by Andrew Wawn with Graham Johnson and John Walter, Making the Middle Ages, 9 (Turnhout: Brepols, 2007), pp. 343-55. Previous studies of Germanic mythology had tended to focus strictly on gods, whereas Grimm 'examined the totality of Germanic religious experience, from the creation narratives of the Prose Edda to the superstitions of the German peasant'.George S. Williamson, The Longing for Myth in Germany: Religion and Aesthetic Culture from Romanticism to Nietzsche (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), p. 104. Grimm was not given to overt discussions of method, but his study implies a set of 'buried theses' which were important to the development of scholarship on mythology: that the study of words as well as stories can reveal past belief-systems, and that 'just as Primitive Germanic word-forms could be \\"reconstructed\\" on a comparative basis, so could Primitive Germanic concepts, and the mythology in which they were embedded'.Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous, ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (p. 23). Grimm also assumed a 'thesis of continuity', whereby later sources could be seen as representations of earlier culture, due to the historical continuities between the two.Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous, ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (p. 24). However, Grimm's mythological methods have also been criticised extensively. Unlike his linguistic methods for reconstructing past languages, they were unable to produce scientifically falsifiable results.Tom Shippey, 'A Revolution Reconsidered: Mythography and Mythology in the Nineteenth Century', in The Shadow-Walkers: Jacob Grimm’s Mythology of the Monstrous, ed. by Tom Shippey, Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies, 291/Arizona Studies in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, 14 (Tempe, AZ: Arizon Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005), pp. 1-28 (pp. 17-18), citing K.-S.

His findings have been shown to have been shaped by his own political leanings: some of his claims in the Deutsche Mythologie related to his views on the proper borders of a Unified Germany and particularly the Schleswig-Holstein Question;Ian Wood, The Modern Origins of the Early Middle Ages (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), pp. 169-71. others were shaped by his sometimes strident, anti-Catholic Protestant sentiments.George S. Williamson, The Longing for Myth in Germany: Religion and Aesthetic Culture from Romanticism to Nietzsche (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004), pp. 98-112. The Deutsche Mythologie in fact implies a range of views on social questions: > He wanted to find a mythology which would not challenge the social > structures of his own day, or would even reinforce the social structures > which Grimm would have liked to see.

The curriculum design, text materials for students, and supporting resources for teachers were created and have been progressively refined by the Connected Mathematics Project (CMP) at Michigan State University with advice and contributions from many mathematics teachers, curriculum developers, mathematicians, and mathematics education researchers. The current third edition of Connected Mathematics is a major revision of the program to reflect new expectations of the Common Core State Standards for MathematicsMath Standards.pdf Common Core State Standards Initiative (CCSSI).

Washington, DC: National Governors Association Center for Best Practices and the Council of Chief State School Officers. and what the authors have learned from over twenty years of field experience by thousands of teachers working with millions of middle grades students. This CMP3 program is now published in paper and electronic form by Pearson Education.  Core Principles  The first edition of Connected Mathematics, developed with financial support from the National Science Foundation, was designed to provide instructional materials for middle grades mathematics based on the 1989 Curriculum and Evaluation StandardsNational Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1989). Curriculum and evaluation standards for school mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. and the 1991 Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. (1991). Professional standards for teaching mathematics. Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. These Standards implied four core features of the curriculum.Lappan, G., Phillips, E. D., Fey, J. T. (2007). The case of Connected Mathematics. In C. R. Hirsch (Ed.), Perspectives on the design and development of school mathematics curricula (pp. 67-79). Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics. *Comprehensive coverage of mathematical concepts and skills in four content strands—Number, Algebra, Geometry/Measurement, Probability/Statistics; *Connections between concepts and methods of the four major content strands and between the abstractions of mathematics and their embodiment in real world problem contexts; *Instructional materials that make classrooms lively places where students learn by solving problems and sharing their thinking with others and where teachers encourage and support students to wonder, to ask questions, and to enjoy learning and using mathematics; *Developing student understanding of mathematical concepts, principles, procedures, and habits of mind and the disposition to use mathematical reasoning in making sense of new situations and solving problems. Those principles have been a consistent guide to development and refinement of the Connected Mathematics program for over twenty years. The first edition was published in 1995; a major revision, also supported by National Science Foundation funding, was published in 2006; and the current third edition was published in 2014. In the third edition, the collection of units was expanded to cover Common Core Standards for both grade eight and Algebra I. Each CMP grade level course aims to advance student understanding, skills, and problem solving in every content strand with increasing sophistication and challenge over the middle school grades. The problem tasks for students are designed to make connections within mathematics, between mathematics and other subject areas, and/or to real world settings that appeal to students. Curriculum units consist of 3 – 5 investigations, each focused on a key mathematical idea; each investigation consists of several major problems that the teacher and students explore in class. Applications/Connections/Extensions problem sets are included for each investigation to help students practice, apply, connect, and extend essential understandings. While engaged in collaborative problem solving and classroom discourse about mathematics, students are explicitly encouraged to reflect on their use of what the NCTM standards called mathematics processes and the Common Core State Standards now refer to as mathematical practices—making sense of problems and solving them, reasoning abstractly and quantitatively, constructing arguments and critiquing reasoning of others, modeling with mathematics, using mathematical tools strategically, seeking and using structure, expressing regularity in repeated reasoning, and communicating ideas and results with precision.  Implementation Challenges  Introduction of new curriculum content, instructional materials, and teaching methods is challenging in K-12 education. When the proposed changes represent contrasts to long-standing traditional practice, it is common to hear concerns from parents, teachers, and other professionals, and even from students who have been successful and comfortable in traditional classrooms. In recognition of this innovation challenge, the National Science Foundation complemented its investment in new curriculum materials with substantial investments in professional development for teachers. By funding State and Urban Systemic Initiatives, Local Systemic Change projects, and Math-Science Partnership programs, as well as National Centers for Standards-based School Mathematics Curriculum Dissemination and Implementation, NSF provided powerful support for adoption and implementation of the various reform mathematics curricula developed during the Standards era. In addition to those programs, for nearly twenty years CMP has sponsored summer Getting to Know CMP institutes, workshops for leaders of CMP implementation, and an annual User’s Conference for sharing of implementation experiences and insights, all on the campus of Michigan State University. The whole reform curriculum effort has greatly enhanced the field’s understanding of what works in that important and challenging processHeck, D. J., Banilower, E. R., Weiss, I. R., & Rosenberg, S.

Research Findings  Connected Mathematics has become the most widely used of middle school curriculum materials developed to implement the NCTM Standards. Effects of its use have been described in expository journal articles and evaluated in mathematics education research projects. Many of the research studies are masters or doctoral dissertation research projects focused on specific aspects of the CMP classroom experience and student learning.

In the large-scale controlled research studies the most common (but by no means universal) pattern of results has been better performance by CMP students on measures of conceptual understanding and problem solving and no significant difference between students of CMP and traditional curriculum materials on measures of routine skills and factual knowledge. For example, this pattern is what the LieCal project found from a longitudinal study comparing learning by students in CMP and traditional middle grades curricula: (1) Students did not sacrifice basic mathematical skills if they are taught using a Standards-based or reform mathematics curriculum like CMP; (2) African American students experienced greater gain in symbol manipulation when they used a traditional curriculum; (3) The use of either the CMP or a non-CMP curriculum improved the mathematics achievement of all students, including students of color; (4) the use of CMP contributed to significantly higher problem-solving growth for all ethnic groups; and (5) A high level of conceptual emphasis in a classroom improved the students’ ability to represent problem situations. Perhaps the most telling result of all is reported in the 2008 study by James Tarr and colleagues at the University of Missouri. While finding no overall significant effects from use of reform or traditional curriculum materials, the study did discover effects favoring the NSF-funded curricula when those programs were implemented with high or even moderate levels of fidelity to Standards-based learning environments. That is, when the innovative programs are used as designed, they produce positive effects.  Historical Controversy  Like other curricula designed and developed during the 1990s to implement the NCTM Standards, Connected Math was criticized by supporters of more traditional curricula. Critics made the following claims: *Reform curricula like CMP pay too little attention to development of basic computational skills in number and algebra; *Student investigation and discovery of key mathematical concepts and skills might lead to critical gaps and misconceptions in their knowledge; *Emphasis on mathematics in real world contexts might cause students to miss abstractions and generalizations that are the powerful heart of the subject; *The lack of explanatory prose in textbooks makes it hard for parents to help their children with homework. *Small-group learning is less efficient than teacher-led direct instructional methods, and the most able and interested students might be held back by having to collaborate with less able and motivated students. Reassuring results from a variety of research projects blunted concerns about basic skill mastery, missing knowledge, and student misconceptions resulting from use of CMP and other reform curricula. Experience with use of CMP and other Standards-based curricula suggests that learning mathematics through investigation of contextualized problems is engaging for middle grades students and it helps them to connect new abstractions with prior knowledge.

The treaty and its consequences increased anti-foreign sentiment in China, which came to a head in the Boxer Uprising of 1900. The contents of the agreement were made public only in 1922. Background Following the Treaty of Shimonoseki ending the First Sino-Japanese War and the Triple Intervention, China was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Empire of Japan (230 million kuping taels equal to 8,600 tonnes of silver). In order to raise the funds for this payment, China approached France and Russia for loans. Taking advantage of this situation, Russian finance minister Sergei Witte established the Russo-Chinese Bank, which was controlled by the Russian government, and agreed to facilitate the loans. Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 209-210 Contents Meeting with Li Hongzhang in Moscow during the coronation ceremonies for Tsar Nicholas II, Witte promised to maintain Chinese territorial integrity and suggested a secret military alliance against possible future aggression by the Empire of Japan. In exchange, Russia would be allowed to use Chinese ports for its warships, and to build a Russian gauge railway through Heilongjiang and Jilin to Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. Along with the railway concession, Russian personnel and police received extraterritorial jurisdiction over large portions of Northeast China and the permission to station troops to protect the railway. China was also not allowed to interfere with Russian troop movements or munitions and also had to grant Russia decreased tariff rates. To avoid diplomatic issues with the other major powers, Li insisted that the concession be granted to the Russo-Chinese Bank, rather than directly to the Russian government, making the railway nominally a joint project, although it was in reality completely financed and controlled by Russia. Consequences The terms of the treaty were tantamount to the annexation of northeast China by Russia in all but name. Rather than protecting China from Japanese territorial ambitions, the treaty opened the door towards further Russian expansionism in the form of the Russia–Qing Convention of 1898, in which China was forced to lease the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula to Russia and allow a southern extension of Russia's China Eastern Railway to be built from northern Harbin to the port city of Dalian. These events increased anti- foreign sentiment in China, which came to a head in the Boxer Uprising of 1900.

It maintains a system of courts and sits above the other courts and is the final court of appeal. It can also re-examine cases if new evidence emerges. Jurisdiction The Supreme Court is independent as of the third amendment to the Constitution of Indonesia. The Supreme Court has oversight over the high courts (Pengadilan Tinggi) and district courts (Pengadilan Negeri). There are about 68 high courts: 31 General Courts,http://www.mahkamahagung.go.id/daftarweb2.asp?jns=Umum 29 Religious Courts,http://www.mahkamahagung.go.id/daftarweb2.asp?jns=Agama 4 Administrative Courtshttp://www.mahkamahagung.go.id/daftarweb2.asp?jns=TUN and 4 Military Courts.http://www.mahkamahagung.go.id/daftarweb2.asp?jns=Militer There are around 250 district courts with additional district courts being created from time to time.In late 2011, the former chief justice of the Supreme Court, Harifin A. Tumpa, said that the Indonesian government could only aim to establish district courts in 400 of the nation's 530 provinces, regencies (kabupaten) and municipalities (kotamadya). The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal (kasasi) following appeals from the district courts to the high courts. The Supreme Court can also re-examine cases if sufficient new evidence is found.Indrayana (2008), p. 450Tabalujan (2002) Constitutional matters, however, fall within the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court of Indonesia, established in 2003. Justices According to the Constitution, candidates for Supreme Court Justices are required to have integrity and be of good character as well as be experienced in law.In practice, other qualifications are required as well. In 2011 the chief justice of the Supreme Court, Judge Harifin Tumpa, issued a circular stating that any judges who intended to apply for the position of Supreme Court judge needed to have 20 years experience at the district court level and three years experience at the high court level. '111 judges apply for Supreme Court', The Jakarta Post, 5 January 2012. Candidates are proposed to the House of Representatives by the Judicial Commission.For a report on the process of the selection of six new judges to the Supreme Court in 2011, see Ina Parlina, KY recommends 18 'quality' justice candidates to House' , The Jakarta Post, 2 August 2011. If the House of Representatives approves them, their appointment is then confirmed by the president. As of mid 2011, there was a total of 804 courts of various kinds in Indonesia.Sebastiaan Pompe, 'The Judge S case why court oversight fails', The Jakarta Post, 13 June 2011. About 50 justices sat in the Supreme Court while other high and lower courts across Indonesia employed around 7,000 judges.Ina Parlina, 'Judicial Commission finds justices an elusive lot', The Jakarta Post, 16 July 2011. According to a recent Supreme Court annual report, in 2011 there were 3,927 general court judges, 3,619 religious court judges, 320 state administrative court judges, and 95 military judges in Indonesia. 'Better standard needed to perform high profile duty', The Jakarta Post, 26 April 2012. Officially, the Supreme Court consists of 51 justices divided into 8 chambers. The Indonesian Supreme Court building in Jakarta =Chief justice= The chief justice and his or her deputy is elected by the Supreme Court justices from among the members of the court.Indrayana (2008), pp. 450–451 Sometimes the process is controversial and attracts public criticism.Markus Junianto Sihaloho and Muninggar Sri Saraswati, 'Critics Slam Harifin's Rise to Chief Justice', The Jakarta Globe, 16 January 2009. For example, in early 2012 rumours about vote buying were reported in the Jakarta press as speculation mounted about the arrangements underway for the selection of new chief justice to replace Harifin A. Tumpa (who retired as chief justice in March 2012). There was said to be \\"all-out competition\\" for the post of chief justice because of the influence that the position holds and it was rumoured that the competition might include payments.Ina Parlina, 'Court election plagued with money politics', The Jakarta Post, 7 February 2012. In the election held on 8 February 2012, Muhammad Hatta Ali comfortably won the position of chief justice ahead of four other candidates.Ina Parlina and Dicky Christanto, 'High hopes for new justice', The Jakarta Post, 9 February 2012. He was sworn in as chief justice by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 1 March 2012. Hatta first became a judge in 1982 when he took up a position on the North Jakarta District Court. He was appointed to the High Court in 2003 and then to the Supreme Court in 2007.'Indonesia's New Supreme Court Chief Has Questions About His Past', The Jakarta Post, 9 February 2012. Wirjono Prodjodikoro, who held office from 1952 to 1966, has been the longest office- holder of the position of chief justice. Conduct of court business Like most of the Indonesian legal system, the Supreme Court is badly overloaded with demands on resources. One observer has noted that \\"the Supreme Court is drowning in an increasing flood of new cases each year\\".Sebastiaan Pompe, ''Setengah matang': The new face of the Supreme Court', The Jakarta Post, 19 September 2011. In 2010, for example, there were reportedly more than 22,000 cases before the court of which the court managed to rule on fewer than 14,000.Ina Parlina, 'Supreme Court plans a new five-chamber system', The Jakarta Post, 2 August 2011. Partly in response to pressures of this kind, proposals for reform of the way that court business is conducted have been under consideration for some time. Current proposals (2011) indicate that a new chamber structure will be introduced to try to improve the operations of the court. The plan is to introduce a system of five chambers which will deal with criminal, civil, religious, administrative, and military affairs. However, the changes are controversial so further reforms may be needed in due course. The funding for the Supreme Court allocated from the national government budget in 2010 was slightly over Rp 6.0 trillion (around $US 700 million at the prevailing foreign exchange rate).Data are from official budget figures issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Finance. One significant problem for the Indonesian legal system overall (although less so for the Supreme Court itself) is that most Indonesian judges in lower courts are not well paid. The official base salary of a judge, before some additional allowances, is often below $US 300 per month. As a result, some judges are tempted to accept bribes in the course of their duties.Rizky Amelia, 'KPK Probe Widens in Judicial Bribery Case', The Jakarta Globe, 24 August 2012. The low salaries paid to judges have been a source of much attention in Indonesia recently with judges urging the government and parliament to tackle the issue,Hasyim Widhiarto, 'Judges strive to uphold dignity despite low pay', The Jakarta Post, 26 April 2012. See also Hasyim Widhiarto, 'Training judges to avoid corruption', and 'Better standard needed to perform high profile duty', both in The Jakarta Post, 26 April 2012. and even threatening to go on strike over the matter.Agus Triyono, 'Indonesia's Chief Justice Threatens Sanctions for Striking Judges', The Jakarta Globe, 26 April 2012. Inevitably, poor performance and difficulties in lower courts leads to problems for the Supreme Court in the efforts by the Court to establish legal standards across the country. These problems receive considerable attention in Indonesia and there is much public discussion about the best ways to promote reform.Achmad Cholil, 'Let's save Indonesian judges, courts', The Jakarta Post, 29 November 2012. There are, at times, criticisms of the way that the court administers itself. In May 2014, for example, the Supreme Court justices collectively agreed to the use of the court budget to hire a special jet to take more than 180 justices to the Wakatobi diving resort in Southeast Sulawesi. Participants on the tour were housed in various hotels as the expense of the court. Judicial watchdog groups and others criticised the court although court officials defended the arrangement.Ina Parlina, 'Supreme Court under fire for lavish trip to Wakatobi', The Jakarta Post, 23 May 2014. Enforcement of rulings One common criticism of the legal system in Indonesia is that law enforcement is weak. Even when the law is clear, and even when courts issue clear rulings, enforcement is often weak.See International Crisis Group, Indonesia: Defying the State , Update Briefing, Asia Briefing No 138, 30 August 2012. In recent years, this criticism has often been made of the operations of the Supreme Court in Indonesia as well of the operations of other parts of the Indonesian legal system. The issue is, in principle, a serious matter for the Supreme Court because enforcement of the rulings of the Supreme Court sets standards for the enforcement of rulings across much of the rest of the Indonesian legal system. The central problem appears to be that the institutions and mechanisms for enforcement of the legal system, including the decisions of the Supreme Court, are underfunded and are operationally weak. There are thus numerous instances of long delays in the enforcement of the decisions of the Supreme Court.Ina Parlina, 'When Supreme Court is ignored, citizens lose access to justice', The Jakarta Post, 8 September 2011. As just one example, in a well publicised case, one of Indonesia's leading universities, the Bogor Agricultural Institute, was instructed by the Supreme Court to release certain details of controversial research conducted within the institute relating to the testing of formula milk brands on sale in Indonesia. However following the Supreme Court ruling, the institute failed to comply and even failed to pay a trivial fee (around $230) incurred as a result of certain proceedings during the conduct of the case.Bruce Gale, 'Sour Taste of Tainted Milk Controversy', The Jakarta Globe, 1 July 2011, See also Ina Parlina, op cit. Numerous other cases of delays are regularly reported in the Indonesian media and are commented on by lawyers who have won cases in the Supreme Court.

He was also an enthusiastic horse rider, huntsman and farmer, and was known at the Bar for his outstanding memory. Family Coulson was from an East Riding Yorkshire family in Driffield; his father was a wealthy wool merchant. He attended the independent Fulneck School in Leeds as a boarding pupil before going up to Merton College, Oxford. His National Service was spent in the East Riding Yeomanry in the Wenlock's Horse. Early career In 1951 Coulson was called to the Bar by the Middle Temple, and joined the North Eastern Circuit, although he also participated in London cases. At the same time he became active in the Young Conservatives and did much to improve their organisation in the north of England, including drafting their constitution. He was an active member of the Territorial Army in the Queen's Own Yorkshire Yeomanry where he received a commission as a Major. Marriage and farming In 1955 he married Dilys Adair Jones, a marriage which also brought him a farm on the Jones estate at Bolton Percy near Tadcaster, North Yorkshire. Coulson enjoyed farming and trained at the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, but suffered an embarrassing failure while attempting to farm turkeys in a cold winter. He was forced to herd them into the farmhouse airing cupboard to keep them warm, and eventually the stockman poisoned the entire flock in a dispute with Coulson's father-in-law. Coulson also enjoyed horse riding, including fox hunting, and acted as secretary to meetings of the Bramham Moor and York and Ainsty Point to Point Race. Political advancement Elected to Tadcaster Rural District Council, Coulson had higher ambitions and in 1958 was selected as Conservative Party candidate for Kingston upon Hull North, a seat the retiring Conservative MP, Austen Hudson held by a knife-edge majority of 590. After energetically campaigning, he won the seat at the 1959 general election with a majority which increased to 702. His maiden speech was regarded as outstandingly witty and was reported in Punch. Parliamentary career Coulson was a loyal supporter of Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home, but made his contribution by introducing a successful Private Member's Bill to abolish the farthing as legal tender. In 1962 he was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Solicitor General, Sir Peter Rawlinson. He also had an interest in Commonwealth affairs and served as a member of the executive committee of the Conservative Commonwealth Council. Judge Losing his seat at the 1964 general election, Coulson received a promotion in his legal career as Assistant Recorder of Sheffield in 1965. He was made Deputy Chairman of the Northern Agricultural Land Tribunal in 1967, and served there for six years; from 1968 he was a Regional Chairman of Industrial Tribunals. His marriage under strain, in the 1970s Coulson moved to the East Midlands to become a full-time chairman of Industrial Tribunals. He became a member of the Belvoir Hunt and in 1977, a hunting acquaintance twenty years his junior (Barbara Chambers) became his second wife. From 1981 he worked as a Recorder of the Crown Court, and from 1983 he was a Circuit Judge on the Midland and Oxford Circuit. In his home village of Wymondham, Leicestershire near Melton Mowbray he was known as the \\"hunting Judge\\". In 1990 Coulson received his final promotion as a Deputy Circuit Judge. A fourth similar precedent in the law reports of that year was entered in Coulson's 1994 judgment, when on appeal, he awarded Trevor McAuley £5,900 for unfair dismissal for racism after McAuley proved a case establishing that a certain additional level of damages can be awarded for having been a victim of a vicious and highly organised campaign of making fun of his Irish accent.

A Patriot force consisting principally of militia from North Carolina and Georgia was surprised, suffering significant casualties. The battle occurred only a few weeks after a resounding American Patriot victory over a Loyalist militia at Kettle Creek, north of Augusta, reversing its effect on morale. Background Following the entry of France into the American Revolutionary War in 1778, the British focused their attention on the American South, which they had not paid great attention to in the early years of the war. The British began their \\"southern strategy\\" by sending expeditions from New York City and Saint Augustine, East Florida to capture Savannah, Georgia late in 1778. The New York expedition, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Archibald Campbell, arrived first, and successfully captured the town on December 29, 1778.Russell, pp. 100–103 =British occupation of Augusta= When Brigadier General Augustine Prevost arrived from Saint Augustine in mid- January, he assumed command of the garrison there, and sent a force under Campbell to take control of Augusta and raise Loyalist militia companies.Ashmore and Olmstead, p. 86 Leaving Savannah on January 24, Campbell and more than 1,000 men arrived near Augusta a week later, with only minimal harassment from Georgia Patriot militia on the way. Augusta had been defended by South Carolina General Andrew Williamson leading about 1,000 militia from Georgia and South Carolina, but he withdrew most of his men when Campbell approached. This rear guard skirmished with Campbell's men before withdrawing across the Savannah River into South Carolina.Wilson, pp. 84–86 Campbell then began recruiting Loyalists. About 1,100 men signed up, but relatively few actually formed militia companies. Campbell then began requiring oaths of loyalty, on pain of forfeiture of property; many took this oath insincerely, quickly letting Williamson know their true feelings. Campbell also anticipated but did not receive Indian support while at Augusta, and was concerned that a recruiting expedition into the Carolinas by Loyalist John Boyd, might not succeed in raising a large supporting force.Wilson, p. 87 The arrival of more than 1,000 North Carolina Patriot militia under General John Ashe in Williamson's camp prompted Campbell to decide on February 12 to abandon Augusta. Two days later, the same day that Boyd's force of 600–700 was defeated in the Battle of Kettle Creek, Campbell withdrew from Augusta and began marching back toward Savannah.Hall, p. 84 =Campbell leaves Augusta= Campbell did not find out about the Battle of Kettle Creek until after he had already left Augusta. During the occupation of Augusta, he had suffered only a single casualty, but the means of that loss was cause for anger among his regulars. One of the 71st Regiment's men had been assigned as a \\"safeguard\\" in a private residence, a position normally out of bounds to attack in European warfare. This soldier had been killed by Patriot partisans, and neither Williamson nor Lincoln wanted to prosecute them for the violation.Wilson, p. 89 Campbell led the troops south until they reached Ebenezer, burning the bridge across Brier Creek on the way. At Ebenezer he turned command of the column over to General Prevost's younger brother, Lieutenant Colonel Mark Prevost, and headed down the river to return to England.Wilson, p. 90 General Ashe trailed after Campbell, and on February 26 camped near the confluence of Brier Creek and the Savannah River, about to the north. Ashe set his men to repairing the bridge.Wilson, p. 91Howard, p. 486 While encamped there, he was joined by about 200 light cavalry and some additional light infantry units, swelling his force to about 1,300 men. = Geography = Brier Creek itself is a riverine watercourse traversing much of eastern Georgia between the Ogeechee River and the Savannah River. It arises between Warrenton in Warren County and Thomson in McDuffie County in the lower portion of the Piedmont. The upper portion of the creek is surrounded by open pit kaolin mines as it passes through the Fall Line. From there it enters the upper coastal plain and courses down past towns like Wrens and Waynesboro before joining the Savannah River in eastern Screven County near Sylvania. This waterway has a length of approximately 80 miles (130 kilometers). In many places along the length of its course it is 30 to 50 feet (9 to 16 meters) in width. Near its mouth it is sometimes as broad as 80 feet (25 meters). Much of the lowest portion of the creek is bordered by the Tuckahoe Wildlife Management Area, which contains a significant portion of the battlefield. Site of the battle at present-day Brannen's Bridges. In the foreground is the historical marker for the battle site. Brier Creek can be seen in the background. The joining of Brier Creek with the Savannah River forms a significant geographic constraint upon movement in that area between the forks formed by the creek and river. The land surrounding the creek and river is often swampy, and movement across both waterways is greatly constrained. This lay of the land contributed to the location and consequences of the battle. Prelude The site at which Ashe made his camp has been criticized by contemporary sources and modern historians. With its back to the creek and swampy lands, its front presented no particular opportunities for defense.Ashmore and Olmstead, p. 102 Ashe's adjutant, William Bryan recognized some of these problems, and after Ashe left camp on February 28 to attend a war council at Purrysburg, Bryan moved the camp about one mile (1.6 km) north, nearer the Savannah River and a small hill. Ashe returned to the camp on March 2.Ashmore and Olmstead, p. 103 =Turning the American flank= Marker commemorating the British crossing at Paris' Mill. The bridge at the mill site was burned down by retreating Patriot forces and the advancing British demolished the home and or millhouse of Francis Paris, whose timbers were used to construct a crossing over Brier Creek. Colonel Prevost decided to execute an attack plan devised by Campbell before he left. This plan involved making a large loop, crossing over Brier Creek at a bridge further north and west, and then moving south and trapping Ashe's men on the triangle of land where the creek and the river met. A decoy force would demonstrate at the destroyed bridge site to distract Ashe's men. On March 1, the decoy force, about 500 men including regulars and militia, openly marched north until they were with three miles (4.8 km) of the burned- out bridge, and made camp there. That night, about 900 experienced troops drawn primarily from the 71st Regiment and James Baird's light infantry companies and also including five field pieces and a number of experienced militia units, including members of the Florida Rangers. They made a rapid march north to the Paris Mill bridge. Arriving around 10:00 am the next morning, they found the bridge destroyed, and set about building a temporary bridge to get their equipment across. Concerned that they might be discovered, Prevost sent Baird's light infantry and a company of light dragoons to ford the river the night of March 2. They acted as a screen against discovery of the ongoing work, and cut off Ashe's escape route. Prevost's full party had crossed the river by dawn on March 3. While participants later disagreed on whether or not patrols from Ashe's camp were aware of the British movement, he took no particular action to guard against the possibility. Battle On the afternoon of March 3, a rider galloped into the American camp, warning of the British approach. While the exact amount of time they had to deploy is uncertain, the relatively hurried nature of their deployment was clear. The number of troops that actually formed up was about 900, as a number of troops had been dispatched to the south for scouting, and others were on duty at the burned-out bridge. Distribution of ammunition to the men was complicated by the shortage of cartouche boxes and varying musket calibers. When the American lines were finally formed, the left side was flanked by Brier Creek, but there was a large gap on the right side, between the end of the line and the river. The left was held by the North Carolina New Bern regiment, the center by a combination of Georgia militia and Continental Army units under Samuel Elbert, and the right was held primarily by the North Carolina Edenton regiment. Replica of a cannon of the type used in the battle. Prevost's troops approached in three columns. Baird's light infantry were on the left, the 1st battalion of the 71st was in the center, and Carolina provincials and \\"rangers\\" formed the right. Prevost held in reserve the light dragoons and grenadiers. Both sides opened fire at long range, and then Elbert's men moved forward to close the range. Two things then occurred to create a gap in the American line. Elbert's men drifted left as they advanced, partially screening the fire from the New Bern men, and British cavalry threatened the right, drawing the Edenton men away from the center. Seeing this opening, Prevost ordered his men to fix bayonets and charge. Most of the Patriot militia did not have bayonets. Seeing the British charging at them, many broke and ran without even firing a shot. The Edenton men fired a few rounds, and then abandoned the fight. Elbert's Continentals held formation in the center while the militia around them fled for the swamps, and were eventually surrounded, forcing Elbert to surrender. The 200 men at the bridge came up to the battlefield late in the fighting, but quickly withdrew before getting drawn into the rout. Aftermath State historical marker commemorating the battle. Picture taken March 3, 2007, the 228th anniversary of the battle. The British counted five killed and eleven wounded. The carnage on the American side was never fully tallied, as many militiamen retreated all the way back to North Carolina, and an unknown number drowned in the swamps. Prevost claimed that 150 American bodies were found on the battlefield, and that 227 captives were taken, mostly from Elbert's Continentals. Anthony Lytle, the commander of the American light infantry, dispersed his men to avoid capture. General Ashe was seen riding after the militia companies, and was widely blamed for the disaster, often amid claims that he led the retreat. A court martial acquitted him of charges of cowardice, but did convict him of failure to secure his camp. Brier Creek stalemated American attempts to force the enemy out of the new state and guaranteed British domination of the region. William Moultrie, in his memoirs of the war, wrote that the loss at Brier Creek extended the war by a year and made possible the British invasion of South Carolina in 1780.Howard, p. 477 It also caused the state of Georgia to temporarily revert to British colony status from 1779 to 1782. The battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020.

It was written and directed by Luigi Cozzi and has Lou Ferrigno reprising his role as the title character. Summary The film opens explaining the story of Zeus' Seven Mighty Thunderbolts that kept peace. One day, other vengeful gods (Aphrodite, Hera, Poseidon, and Flora) stole these lightning bolts to create chaos. The lack of these thunderbolts has rendered Zeus powerless and sent the Moon on a collision course with the Earth. As the humans on Earth begin to suffer, two sisters named Urania and Glaucia speak to the Little People and learn that only Hercules can save them now. After hesitation, Zeus finally decides to send Hercules back from the stars to Earth to aid the humans, but the vengeful gods resurrect their own warrior: King Minos. They believe that King Minos, with the help of Dedalos can defeat Zeus with science. Thus begins Hercules' quest to find the Seven Mighty Thunderbolts, which are hidden inside monsters across the Universe. Firstly, Hercules fights and defeats an apelike creature and retrieves the first thunderbolt. Meanwhile, the four gods bring King Minos back to life with help, Hercules also teams up with Glaucia and rescues her sister Urania from hideous monsters called the Slime People. They are overwhelmed by their huge numbers and they flee into a cave where they meet Euryale. The cave is full of stone statues and Hercules and the sisters battle some more monsters, while Euryale walks away and reveals herself to be a snake-haired, half-woman, half-scorpion Gorgon. Using his shield as a mirror, Hercules avoids getting turned into stone and manages to decapitate Euryale, and retrieves the second thunderbolt. Hercules and the two sisters sail to an island and enter an old, haunted forest with strange human dolls hanging from the trees. He is then attacked by a demonic sorcerer-knight, but Hercules overwhelms the knight and impales him onto a poisonous thorn branch, revealing the third thunderbolt. Glaucia is captured by a high priest's soldiers to be sacrificed to the deadly fire monster Antaeus, Urania then rescues her while Hercules battles Antaeus, summoned by the priest, and defeats him by throwing around the Earth until he crashes into the sea, also revealing the fourth thunderbolt. Hercules and Glaucia then battle some Amazon warriors but he is captured by them, Urania wakes Hercules up and he strangles their leader Arachne, the Queen of the Spiders, whose body contained the fifth thunderbolt. The three travel up in space where Urania reveals the location of the sixth thunderbolt, that was inside a rock. Glaucia tries to kill Urania, Minos appears and reveals that when both Hercules and Urania had lost Glaucia, he commanded Poseidon to use the waters to drain her life. Hercules battles Minos who transforms into a dinosaur while Hercules transforms into a gorilla and manages to destroy Minos once and for all. The warrior finally deals with the Earth and the Moon problem, as, with Zeus' help, he grows as big as the galaxy and stops them from colliding into each other, putting the Moon back in its proper place. Urania then reveals that, with information she received earlier from the Little People, she is the daughter of Hera and that her body contains the seventh thunderbolt, decides to sacrifice her life so Zeus can retrieve the thunderbolt, and does so, by allowing Hera to give her the \\"kiss of death\\". Both Hercules and Urania are honored by Zeus, become gods and are able to live with them.

The film stars Michael Caine, Julie Walters, Michael Williams and Maureen Lipman. It won multiple major awards for best actor and best actress and was nominated for three Academy Awards. Caine and Walters both won BAFTA and Golden Globe awards for best actor and actress. The British Film Institute ranked Educating Rita the 84th greatest British film of the 20th century.British Film Institute - Top 100 British Films (1999). Retrieved 27 October 2017 Plot Susan (who initially calls herself Rita) (Julie Walters), a 26-year-old Liverpudlian working-class hairdresser, is dissatisfied with the routine of her work and social life; she is reluctant to have a child, fearing it will permanently tie her to the same monotonous routine for life, and she yearns to escape to something more profound, without exactly knowing what that is. She seeks to better herself by signing up for and attending an Open University course in English Literature. Susan's assigned Open University professor, Frank Bryant (Michael Caine), is jaded and has long ago openly taken to the bottle, describing his occupational ability as \\"appalling but good enough for his appalling students\\". Bryant's passion for literature is reignited by Rita, whose technical ability for the subject is limited by her lack of education but whose enthusiasm Frank finds refreshing. Frank initially has misgivings about Rita's ability to adapt to student culture, but is impressed by her verve and earnestness and is forced to re-examine his attitudes and position in life; Susan finds Frank's tutelage opens doors to a bohemian lifestyle and a new self-confidence. Frank's bitterness and cynicism return as he notices Susan beginning to adopt the pretensions of the university culture he despises. Susan becomes disillusioned by a friend's attempted suicide and realises that her new social niche is rife with the same dishonesty and superficiality she had previously sought to escape. The film ends as Frank, sent to Australia on a sabbatical, welcomes the possibilities of the change.

Julie Walters, in her feature film debut, reprised her role from the stage production. The film is set in an unnamed English university and port city – by implication, Liverpool (most of the working-class characters have Scouse accents). However, it was shot entirely in and around Dublin, which was given an English appearance: in several street scenes, for example, British red telephone boxes appear. Trinity College, Dublin, is used as the setting for the university, and University College Dublin, in Belfield, is used for Rita's summer school. The rooms used by Bryant as his office and tutorial room were those of the College Historical Society and the University Philosophical Society, respectively; and while the building was considerably refurnished, the production chose to leave portraits of Douglas Hyde and Isaac Butt and committee photographs in the former, and a bust of John Pentland Mahaffy in the latter. No. 8 Hogan Avenue in Dublin 2 near Grand Canal Dock was used for Rita's house in the film, and one in Burlington Road, Ballsbridge for Bryant's. The scene where Rita runs into her ex Denny and his new wife was filmed in the South Lotts area of Ringsend. The scene in France was filmed in Maynooth, County Kildare, and Pearse Station and Dublin Airport were also used. The scene in the pub was shot in The Stag's Head pub on Dame Court in Dublin. However, the pub which Rita enters is the Dame Tavern which is opposite The Stag's Head. Filming also took place in Stoneybatter, with Aughrim Street Church being used for the wedding scene. Stanhope Street School was used as a production base. Reception =Critical response= The American Variety magazine in December 1982 lauded Walters' interpretation of Rita as \\"[w]itty, down-to-earth, kind and loaded with common sense.\\" \\"Rita,\\" the review continues, \\"is the antithesis of the humorless, stuffy and stagnated academic world she so longs to infiltrate. Julie Walters injects her with just the right mix of comedy and pathos.\\" Ian Nathan reviewing the film for Britain's Empire film magazine calls the film a \\"gem,\\" and gives it four out of five stars. He describes Walters's \\"splendidly rich interpretation\\" of Rita and characterises her \\"reactions to the traditions of English lit[erature] [as] carry[ing] the caustic brilliance of true intelligence, a shattering of blithe pretension\\". Of Walters and Caine, Nathan opines, \\"they make a beautifully odd couple, in a love story at one remove\\". This reviewer depicts the director's effort as \\"effective, and finally optimistic,\\" and observes about the film that the playwright's \\"angry message that people are trapped by their environment not their abilities, is salved by the sweetness of [Frank's and Rita's] final parting.\\" Nathan's \\"verdict\\" of the film is one of \\"[c]harming, glittering characterisations that, though they don't run deep, nevertheless refresh.\\" Janet Maslin of the New York Times called the film \\"an awkward blend of intellectual pretension and cute obvious humour\\" and \\"the perfect play about literature for anyone who wouldn't dream of actually reading books\\"; she wrote that \\"the essentially two-character play has been opened up to the point that it includes a variety of settings and subordinate figures, but it never approaches anything lifelike\\". Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film two stars out of four, calling the film a \\"forced march through a formula relationship\\"; he said Russell's screen adaptation \\"added mistresses, colleagues, husbands, in-laws, students and a faculty committee, [that were] all unnecessary\\" and said the playwright/screenwriter \\"start[ed] with an idealistic, challenging idea, and then cynically tr[ied] to broaden its appeal\\".

Biography  Lovísa was born to a Sri Lankan father and an Icelandic mother. She moved to Iceland at a young age where she has lived since. As a child she began taking piano lessons but started playing electric bass and guitar in her teens, and has since then played with numerous local bands. She joined the band Benny Crespo's Gang playing keyboards/synthesizers and guitar. It was then when she first started to use her voice. Lay Low, the alter ego of Lovísa, started to evolve early in 2006. She was spotted by a local label, Cod Music, which contacted her and showed an interest in a raw demo song she had published on MySpace. Her music combines elements of blues, folk and country. It was a rapid rise in the music scene for Lovísa. Just a few months after her discovery she released her debut album, Please Don't Hate Me, which went gold only two months after its release. The following year she was nominated for four of the 2006 Icelandic Music Awards, winning two; Best female singer and best album cover. She was also voted by the nation through phone election as the most popular artist of 2006. In 2007 she was offered a role in the play Ökutímar by Leikfélag Akureyrar, writing both original songs for the play and performing covers of Dolly Parton songs. The play was a huge success and the following year saw the release of the soundtrack from the play, as well as winning the Gríman award for best music in a play. She also worked with Icelandic musician KK, performing songs for the Baltasar Kormákur film Brúðguminn, as well as releasing an album with Benny Crespo's Gang. In mid-2008 Lovísa spent some time in London recording her third solo album, Farewell Good Night's Sleep, released on 16 October the same year. The album was recorded at Toerag Studios and produced by Liam Watson. Lovísa toured extensively in 2009, mostly supporting Emiliana Torrini in Europe and USA along with headlining shows all over the world. She also performed at festivals such as Glastonbury, End of the Road Festival and Into The Great Wide Open. The same year, Lay Low and a film crew recorded Flatey, a live CD/DVD performance on the tiny island of Flatey, which was released in September. On 4 November 2009 the movie December, a film by Hilmar Oddsson, was premiered. Lovísa played one of the leading roles in the film among renowned Icelandic actors Tómas Lemarquis, Laufey Elíasdóttir and Stefán Hallur Stefánsson. This was her first time acting for a film. The year 2010 for Lovísa started off with touring far from her home, traveling to Australia and Tokyo with Emiliana Torrini. And in the spring again she got the opportunity to work in the film industry by lending and writing a few of her songs for the film King's Road (Kóngavegur). In 2012 Lovísa supported Of Monsters and Men on their United States tour.

It is the administrative seat of Murau District. Geography The historic town is located in mountainous Upper Styria in the valley of the Mur river between the Lower Tauern range and the Gurktal Alps. The municipal area comprises the cadastral communities of Laßnitz-Lambrecht, Murau proper and Sankt Egidi, as well as the former independent municipalities of Laßnitz bei Murau, Stolzalpe and Triebendorf which were incorporated in the course of a 2015 administrative reform. Murau currently has a population of 3,688. The town's economy largely depends on tourism, especially in the nearby Kreischberg ski resort. It is also known for its brewing tradition (Murauer Bier) documented since the 15th century. Murau station is a stop on the narrow-gauge Mur Valley Railway (Murtalbahn), running along the Mur river from Unzmarkt up to Mauterndorf in Salzburg. History The area was already settled in the Bronze Age through the Roman Era. Based on an entry in the Tabula Peutingeriana the ancient city of Noreia, capital of the Celtic kingdom Noricum, was thought to be near Murau in the late 18th and the 19th century. However, no archaeological evidence has been found so far. Murau Castle and St Matthew's parish church Murowe itself, centre of the Styrian estates in the Mur valley held by the noble Liechtenstein family, was first mentioned in a 1250 deed. The famous minnesinger Ulrich von Liechtenstein (d. 1275) from nearby Frauenburg had a castle erected at Murau which was again demolished when the Bohemian king Ottokar II occupied the Styrian lands upon his victory at Kressenbrunn in 1260. Ulrich had to cede his estates to the king and was temporarily arrested in Moravia. The Liechtenstein estates were restored, when Ottokar was finally defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. Ulrich's son Otto had the Gothic parish church of St Matthew's with its characteristic crossing tower built from 1284, it was consecrated by the Lavant bishop in 1296. The Murau citizens were vested with town privileges in 1298, whereafter the town was fortified and significantly enlarged. From 1480 to 1490, the town was occupied by the Hungarian forces of King Matthias Corvinus. The Liechtensteins held Murau until the late 16th century. From 1623 onwards, it was a possession of the House of Schwarzenberg who had Murau Castle rebuilt in its present Renaissance style. The present owner is Karel Schwarzenberg. During World War II a camp of the Wehrmacht armed forces was located here, in which captured British prisoners of war were held enthralled. At the end of the war in May 1945, local groups of resistance fighters freed eight remaining POWs and successfully led the approaching Red Army forces to believe that the town was already occupied by the British. Population  Events  Julius Caesar by William Shakespeare performed in Murau, 2014 The Murtalbahn steam train is a historic part of the town, as well as one of its tourist attractions. Murau is also known for its annual Samson parades on August 15. Since 2002, the annual festival Shakespeare in Styria presents productions of Shakespeare plays in the town's Festival Hall, in the Courtyard of the Murau Castle as well as at the Domenig Pavillon in the park of the town. The festival was founded in 2002 by British born theatre manager Nicholas Allen and Austrian writer Rudolph J. Wojta. Each year it presents another play performed by young actors and actresses from all over Europe directed by experienced British directors. In the early years of the festivals performances were in English. Since 2013 productions are performed in German and directed by Nicholas Allen and US-American sword-master Roberta Brown. Since the summer of 2016, the festival has been based at St. Lambrecht Abbey, some 14 kilometres from Murau and no performance have taken place in Murau.

Many refugees who returned to Ghurian after working as migrants in Iran's saffron industry came with corms and the skills to grow and produce saffron. The United Nations, the World Bank, and later governments supported growing saffron as a crop that is economically competitive with opium poppies and, importantly for the arid west, also requires less water than wheat growing.

Education Stephen was educated at Uppingham School, the University of Leeds in West Yorkshire, where he obtained his BA degree, and the University of Sheffield (in South Yorkshire), where he obtained a distinction for his PhD while also working full-time at Haileybury College. Career After working in remand homes while still a teenager, Stephen returned briefly to Uppingham as a teacher of English. For ten years at Haileybury College he also taught English, and became a housemaster. He moved for four years to be second master of Sedbergh School, then became headmaster of The Perse School, an independent school in Cambridge, then High Master of Manchester Grammar School, an independent school in Manchester. He served as chairman of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference, a group of 250 independent schools. In 2004 he moved from Manchester to St Paul's. On 29 June 2010, he announced his decision to stand down as High Master of St Paul's in August 2011. In the days following his announcement, The Times reported that there had been an \\"apparent confrontation\\" with governors over Stephen's ability to raise funds for the school's redevelopment. This claim was rebutted by the school in a letter sent to The Times, in which the chairman of the governors stated there was \\"no lack of confidence in [Stephen's] fundraising abilities\\", but rather Stephen had chosen not to seek renewal of his contract in 2011 to allow a new head to provide continuity of oversight throughout the multimillion-pound redevelopment. Stephen had in fact led a campaign that had raised over £30m for St Paul's School, and had previously raised over £10m for bursaries at Manchester Grammar School. In November 2010, he announced that he was to take sabbatical leave from 1 January 2011 until July 2011, when his tenure as High Master was due to end. He was succeeded by Mark Bailey, who agreed to \\"give some of his time\\" to St Paul's for the first half of 2011.

It is narrated by a young girl who lives in the Cholistan Desert and centers on the story of her coming-of-age. It is succeeded by the novels Haveli and The House of Djinn. Staples had lived in Asia for about twelve years prior to writing the novel. Plot summary Shabanu lives in the Cholistan Desert in Pakistan, where they play games near the border of India. She is the second daughter of a peaceful, loving family of camel breeders. Shabanu is on the brink of womanhood; her older sister Phulan is already marriageable, and soon will be married to Hamir, a cousin of their family's. Shabanu is also betrothed to Hamir's brother, Murad. At twelve years old, Shabanu is not interested in marriage; she enjoys tending to the animals and especially teaching tricks to her beloved camels, Mithoo and Xhush Dil and Guluband, a camel her father had recently sold against her will. Before Phulan's wedding, however, disaster strikes: Shabanu and Phulan accidentally stumble upon several strange men in the desert, among them an old, wicked landowner named Nazir Mohammad, who was known to have murdered Shabanu's cousin, Lal Khan, in the past. Nazir notices Phulan while hunting quail with his brother and nephew. He decides that Phulan will be the prize for whomever bags the most quail. When Shabanu tells her father, he is enraged and goes to tell Nazir that Phulan is betrothed and that Nazir does not have legal ownership of her. Out of anger, Nazir later murders Hamir, whom Phulan was to marry. Phulan has to marry Hamir's brother, Murad, instead, a decision she doesn't oppose, much to Shabanu's anger. When Shabanu learns that she must marry Nazir's brother, Rahim-sahib, an old man who already has three wives, to save her family and her sister's new marriage, she must make a choice between running away, or staying to let her family have their way, which in her eye she thinks is akin to sacrificing her. Main characters *Shabanu – an eleven-year-old girl living in the Cholistan Desert with her family *Phulan – Shabanu's older sister who later takes Murad away from her as her husband. *Mama – Shabanu's mother *Dalil Abbasi (Dadi) – Shabanu's father, a camel breeder *Auntie – the sister-in-law of Dalil Abbasi *Grandfather - Shabanu's grandfather and Dadi's father *Fatima - Sharma's daughter *Sharma - A female cousin of mama and dadi who was known for illegally leaving her abusive husband *Hamir - Shabanu's cousin; Phulan's husband-to-be, but was murdered by Nazir Mohammad *Murad - Shabanu's cousin; Shabanu's husband-to-be, but who later marries Phulan instead *Nazir-Mohammad - wicked landowner who murders Hamir *Rahim-sahib - Nazir's brother, who later takes Shabanu as his fourth wife Sequel In 1993, Suzanne Fisher published a sequel to Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind, Haveli. Haveli shows Shabanu as a mother at age 18 and her ups and downs of her new life at home, her marriage, her daughter, and her life. In the recent installment of the Shabanu series, The House of Djinn follows the life, hardships, decisions, and events that occur in the life of Mumtaz, Shabanu's daughter. Awards and nominations Awarded the Newbery Honor in 1990. Reception and criticism Shabanu has received mainly negative reviews from critics, being criticized for the at times shallow plot and under-developed characters. Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind has also received a number of criticisms for not being up-to-date on Islamic marital customs. Many Muslims feel that the novel reflects badly on their culture, as the information covered is no longer current and not up to date.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 106th Bombay Light Infantry to form the Durham Light Infantry in 1881, the 68th Regiment becoming the 1st Battalion, and the 106th Regiment becoming the 2nd Battalion in the regular Army. It saw action during the Seven Years' War before being converted to Light Infantry in 1808, fighting with distinction in the Peninsular Army under Arthur Wellesley. It would go on to fight with some distinction during the Crimean War, was present during the Indian Mutiny and the New Zealand wars before returning to India between 1872 and 1888. Formation In August 1756, after the loss of Minorca in the Seven Years' War, the 23rd Regiment of Foot, together with 14 other regiments was ordered to raise a 2nd Battalion, which it did while in Leicester.Vane pp. 1–3 On 22 April 1758 the 2nd battalion was separated from the 23rd regiment as a new regiment and ranked as the 68th in order of precedence with the appointment of a new Colonel as Lambton's Regiment of Foot or the 68th Regiment of foot.Ward p.28 (The practice of referring to regiments by their Colonel's name was gradually going out of fashion, being replaced by the regiments order of precedence.Ward pp.23–4) The Seven Years War In May 1758 it marched to the Isle of Wight as part of the forces (14,000 soldiers in 5 brigades and 6000 marines) stationed on the island at the request of Britain's ally Frederick the Great of Prussia. The intention was to conduct raids (descents as they were then called) on the French coast to disturb privateers in the area, distract the French army and relieve pressure on Britain's allies, the Prussians.Vane p. 5 The first expedition (3 Guards, 9 line regimentsVane p.9) anchored at Cancale Bay, near St Malo, on 5 May, the grenadier company being part of the forces that destroyed four King's ships, 60 merchantmen and several privateers in Parame.

A third and final expedition was launched on 3 September; the 68th landed at Lunaire Bay, again near St.Malo, but suffered severe defeat after the French concentrated their army and engaged the British army at St. Cast. The Governor of Brittany, the Duc d’Aiguillon, led a force of 6,000 regulars, several squadrons of cavalry and the \\"Garde de Cote\\" militia against the British, who fought a rearguard action while evacuating the beach. The French claimed British casualties were 900 officers and men, with 600 taken prisoner.

It arrived on 21 June and remained there until February 1760, returning to England. In March, 600 men of the regiment, in three groups of 200, were drafted into the British regiments in the West Indies, this reduced the regiment to a mere 58 rank and file.Ward p. 43 The regiment was marched to Leeds, then Newcastle and billeted at Tynemouth Barracks. At this point, recruiting had enabled it to muster 9 (weak) companies consisting of 41 officers and 239 men. There the 68th would remain through 1761, with a detachment sent to Durham to aid Civil power and providing a draft of 95 men for the 70th regiment.

In February 1851 the Regiment embarked for Malta.Vane pp. 77–80 Crimean War D.C.M., this is possibly the first photograph of this medal.Bilclife p. 52 While in Malta, in February 1854, the regiment was brought up to war establishment (~1240 other ranks), after losing men in drafts to other regiments preceding it to the Black Sea: On 7 August the Regiment, still short of establishment at 867 all ranks, embarked for Beikos bay on the Bosphorus, arriving on 12 August, then Varna on 1 September, where it was posted to the 7th Brigade of the 4th Division, and finally near Eupatoria in the Crimea on 14 September.Vane p. 82 Two companies were detached to provide the escort to Lord Raglan, they were not to rejoin the regiment until April next year.Ward p. 158 At the Battle of Alma the division was in reserve, although the Regiment briefly came under artillery fire. In late September the Regiment arrived at the heights South of Sevastopol, after losing 44 men from Cholera on the Alma battlefield and on the march South.Vane p. 83 On 25 October the Russians attempted to take the port of Balaclava, used by the Allies as the port of supply. The 4th Division arrived late to the battle, its men having spent the night in the trenches before Sevastopol. Arriving as the Russians were retiring, only two companies of the 68th Regiment were present, losing one killed and one injured.Ward p. 163 =Inkerman= On 5 November 1854 the Russians launched an attack on the allies right with ~42,000 men in 3 corps. With the arrival of the 4th Division, which had again spent the night in the trenches around Sevastopol, the British were able to go on the offensive. The 68th numbered only four companies (243 all ranks), two still being in the trenches, and as they wore their greatcoats over their ammunition pouches while on guard had taken these off and were (initially) the only British regiment in red coats.Ward p. 165Vane p. 84 On seeing the Russians attempting to outflank the Guards on Sandbag Battery Cathcart sent Torrens' brigade of ten companies (four of the 20th Regiment, two of the 46th Regiment and the four of the 68th) against them, sending the three Russian battalions into the valley below.Ward pp. 165–166 The 68th followed the Russians too far, and now were out of ammunition. On retiring along the valley they found more Russians on a ridge above their right: It was during this action that Pte. John Byrne and Sgt. Daniel Dwyer returned to this ravine to rescue wounded comrades, which would lead both to be recommended for the Victoria Cross, and Byrne to receive it.Ward p. 166 With this cover, the regiment was reorganised with the rest of the brigade and other stragglers, including Guardsmen, and were then deployed to 'The Barrier' in front of Home Hill for the rest of the battle.Vane p. 85-86 The losses for the day were 69 men killed, wounded or missing.Ward p. 168 The Regiment remained on trench duty in the siege of Sevastopol subject to the poor conditions caused by the poor supply situation, only made worse by the storm of the night of 13/14 November that blew down tents, scattered supplies and sank transport ships in Balaclava harbour.Ward p. 169 The regiment faced a sortie by the Russians from Sevastopol, on 12 January 1855 (the Orthodox New Year) which overran an outpost, resulting in 15 missing and 6 wounded.Ward pp. 174–175 By the end of February the regiment had been rearmed with the new Enfield rifle replacing the smoothbore musket they had started the campaign with.Bilcliffe p. 36 A second, much larger sortie of some 2000 men took place on the night of 11 May was faced by detachments from the Rifle Brigade, 46th Foot and 250 men from the 68th. A party of Russians succeeded in spiking a gun but were driven off with the loss of six dead and 22 wounded. Pte John Byrne was again prominent, and Captain Hamilton was to win the Victoria Cross.Vane p. 88Ward pp. 175–176 The regiment remained in the trenches, with the supply situation slowly improving, and was in reserve for the assault on the Redan both on 18 June and the final attack on 8 September.Ward pp. 176–177 They remained in the Crimea while negotiations were conducted until May 1856 when the regiment embarked for Corfu.Ward p. 178 The casualties in the Crimea were 32 killed, 68 wounded in combat and 205 died from other causes, and the regiment was at a strength of 28 officers and 783 other ranks.Vane p. 90 =Awards= Besides the two V.C.s granted a further nine were applied for but not approved, 15 D.C.M.s were awarded, seven awards of the French Legion of Honour, 13 of the Order of the Medjidie, six of the Sardinian Medal of Honour and seven of the Médaille militaire.Bilcliffe pp. 100–108 Nine officers and men of the Regiment, then in England, mostly returned as sick, received their Crimea Medal directly from Queen Victoria on 18 May 1855.Bilcliffe pp. 112–113 India Ground of the Calcutta Cricket Club, 15th Jan'y. 1861 H.M. 68th L.I. from Rangoon, versus the Calcutta Cricket Club, a lithograph after a watercolour by Percy Carpenter, depicting Calcutta Cricket Club While in Corfu detachments were sent to Kythira, Zakynthos, Ithaca and Cephalonia, where they remained until returned to Britain in September 1857.Vane p. 93 The regiment was given new colours on 5 November by the Duke of Cambridge, and in December, with the suppression of the Indian Mutiny incomplete, it left for India arriving at Rangoon on 30 March 1858.Vane p. 94 While in Burma it was to rotate three of four companies at Myede and Thayetmyo with the rest in Rangoon.Ward p. 180 Control of India passed from the East India Company to The Crown on 1 November, however nothing was to change immediately for the Regiment, its uneventful time in Burma passed with sports and the first of a series of Regimental journals \\"The D.L.I.

During October and November the Regiment embarked on three ships from Rangoon with a strength of 974 officers and men.Ward p. 186Vane p. 96 New Zealand The three ships arrived in Auckland in mid January 1864, almost immediately detachments were sent to Tauranga, Rangariri and Maketu after exchanging their red tunics for blue. British and Māori positions at the Gate Pā, 29 April 1864. In April the Māori of Te Ranga returned from the interior after assisting the Waikatos and began to reoccupy pās in the area, including two on the neck of a peninsula housing the Te Papa mission in Tauranga Harbour. The 68th were concentrated in Auckland and sent to reinforce Tauranga accompanied by detachments from other regiments, arriving on 21 April.Ward pp. 189–190 Two redoubts were built at Tauranga, Monmouth redoubt by the 43rd Regiment and Durham redoubt by the 68th, the latter's location commemorated by 'Durham Street' in the city today.Ward p. 187 The commanding officer Maj. General Cameron wanted the Māori pās quickly reduced, so on the evening of 28 April some 720 men of the 68th crossed to the rear of the Māori line via the mud flats of the harbour and deployed around the neck of the peninsula while another 700 men and artillery pieces prepared to assault from the front.Vane p. 97 At 7 the next morning a bombardment began with five guns and eight mortars, a few of which were 'overs' into the area occupied by the 68th.Ward pp. 190–191 At about 4 in the evening a storming force of ~300 men, part 43rd Regiment, part naval brigade attacked. The companies of the 68th forced a body of Māori back into the pā at around 5 o'clock,Bilcliffe p. 184 and in a turn of events that is still unclear the attacking force was then routed from the pā.Ward p. 191 The 68th spent the night in their position at the rear of the pā, but were unable to form a close enough cordon to prevent the Māori escaping.Ward p. 192Bilcliffe pp.184–185 For six weeks the 68th and the other forces remained in the area around Te Papa, patrolling, with orders to prevent pās being established.Ward p. 193 On 21 June, after days of reports of movements of bodies of armed Māori, a patrol of ~600 men from the 68th, 43rd and a local Regiment, 1st Waikato Militia, led by Lt. Colonel Greer of the 68th, found a similarly sized body preparing rifle pits across a ridge some three miles from Te Papa.Vane p. 98Bilcliffe p. 152 Greer sent for reinforcements, and for two hours until they arrived kept the Māori pinned down, then assaulted the position.Ward p. 195 The rifle pits were taken at a cost to the 68th of 5 killed and 24 wounded, Sgt. Murray was to be awarded the Victoria Cross.Ward p. 196 The next day a burial detail from the 68th interred 109 of the dead at the rifle pits. The 68th remained in Te Papa until February 1865 when a detachment, 240 men strong, was sent to Wanganui when fighting flared up there. By now resentment was growing between the Regular Army soldiers and the local militias, and between their leaders, Cameron and Grey, over the use of the Army to expand the colonists' lands.Ward pp. 198–199 The regiment remained split until both parts moved to Auckland in February 1866, and left New Zealand in March, reaching Portsmouth between mid-June and early July.Vane p. 99 During March 179 men (59 of whom were Crimea veterans) took their discharge and remained in New Zealand, either time served, or who purchased their remaining time or were given it free.Bilcliffe p. 322 1866–1881 The Regiment spent three years in England with a gradual reduction in establishment to 640 men.Vane p. 100 In September 1869 the Regiment was shipped to Ireland where it was split into detachments and posted around the country.Vane pp. 100–102 In September 1871 the establishment was raised to 1032 all ranks prior to the regiment being sent to India in February of the next year. Arriving in March it was barracked in Pune.Vane p. 103 In April 1873, as part of the Cardwell Reforms the Regiment was linked with the 106th Regiment and assigned to district no. 3 at Sunderland Barracks in Sunderland where it was brigaded together with the depot of the 106th Regiment, the district brigade depot and the Militia and Volunteers of County Durham.Ward p. 245 The 68th Regiment were deployed in various parts of central, North and North West India, losing 37 men in cholera outbreaks in September 1878 and May 1979. During 1879 it received drafts of men from the 106th Regiment. It did not take part in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.Vane pp. 103–105 On 1 July 1881 as part of the Childers reforms the 68th Regiment became the 1st Battalion of the Durham Light Infantry while stationed at Meerut.

Secundus of Asti () (died c. 119) is venerated as a martyr and saint. His feast day is generally celebrated on March 29. Until the 15th century it was celebrated at Asti on March 30, but it is now celebrated there on the first Tuesday in May. He was a historical figure who was beheaded at Asti under Hadrian. He is said to have been a patrician of Asti and a subaltern officer in the imperial army. It is known that a church was dedicated to him in the area as early as the 9th century. thumb Legend Later legends made Secundus a member of the Theban Legion. A more elaborate legend states that he was a young man of noble lineage who visited the jails of Asti. Secundus was a friend of Sapricius (Saprizio), prefect of the city. They traveled together to the city of Tortona, where Secundus met the city's first bishop, Marcian, who was later martyred under Hadrian. Secundus' meeting with Marcian influenced his decision to become a Christian; his meeting with Faustinus and Jovita further influenced his conversion. His friend Sapricius attempted to make him abjure his newfound faith. Secundus refused, and was tortured and decapitated.

A hymn tune is the melody of a musical composition to which a hymn text is sung. Musically speaking, a hymn is generally understood to have four-part (or more) harmony, a fast harmonic rhythm (chords change frequently), and no refrain or chorus. From the late sixteenth century in England and Scotland, when most people were not musically literate and learned melodies by rote, it was a common practice to sing a new text to a hymn tune the singers already knew which had a suitable meter and character. There are many hymn tunes which might fit a particular hymn: a hymn in Long Metre might be sung to any hymn tune in Long Metre, but the tunes might be as different as those tunes that have been used for centuries with hymns such as Te lucis ante terminum, on one hand, and an arrangement of the calypso tune used with Jamaica Farewell, on the other. Hymnal editors Editors bring extensive knowledge of theology, poetry, and music to the process of compiling a new hymnal. They seek texts that are capable of communicating complex theological concepts to lay people, and they strive to partner those texts to tunes which are singable by the non- professional musicians of a congregation. When editors choose a text for the planned collection, it may already be paired to a tune that supports its meaning, catches its spirit, and allows for congregational participation. This pairing may be used elsewhere, even ecumenically recognized, appearing in many other hymnals. However, if a hymn has been linked to a tune the editors think is not the best partner for it, they can arrange a new pairing. Partnerships of texts and tunes can give special attention to the interpretive opportunities in a text by providing artistic support of the message through its musical setting. Editors must consider whether the important words in the text fall on stressed notes, whether climax points in the ideas correspond with musical climaxes, and whether the tempo for the music matches the style of the text. Pairing texts to tunes  Often the author of a text has not composed a setting of that text or otherwise paired the text to a particular tune. It then becomes the editor's challenge to complement that text with a tune for publication. Where the meter of a text is regular, editors can choose an existing tune of the meter that fits the text. Often there is more than just one good possible partner available. The editors may marry a text \\"X\\" to a tune they feel is best, with which it appears on the hymnal page, and they may also suggest singing text \\"X\\" to an alternative tune that appears elsewhere in the hymnal (sometimes with a different text). If one refers to the hymnal's metrical index, more possible tunes may be found, of the same meter, which might be used for singing text \\"X\\". In The Anatomy of Hymnody, Austin C. Lovelace explores the relevance of the meter to a text. A meter of few syllables, perhaps with a trochaic stress pattern, fits best an exhortive or forceful declamation of ideas. A stirring, motivating text will fit this meter well. Using a more lyrical meter suggests a more expansive or introspective treatment of ideas. An author may have superb ideas but may have chosen a meter which exhorts when it should be expansive, or is solid when it should be introspective. In such cases the editor is challenged to achieve an overall fit which doesn't distract from the message of the text. Editorial skills are evident in the complex credits of some hymns. For the well-loved and great hymn, \\"All Creatures of Our God and King\\", the words were written by William H. Draper and first published in 1919, based on a 13th-century text by Francis of Assisi, with further adaptations made in 1987. It is wedded to the tune Lasst uns erfreuen, first printed in the Geistliches Kirchengesangbuch, dated 1623, and is presented with a harmonization by Ralph Vaughan Williams, dated 1906. Some texts become associated with several tunes. For different reasons, some tunes set numerous texts. Tunes which are very singable and easy for a congregation to pick up, and do not have musical demands which would interfere with understanding and assimilating the ideas of a text, can be used to set two or three texts in a hymnal, when the editors see that as advantageous. Wareham LM, melody William Knapp (1698–1768), alt., harm. Hymns Ancient and Modern, 1875, after James Turle (1802–1882), sets three texts in Hymnal 1982. It has supported more than 20 texts in various hymnals. =Naming= The practice of naming hymn tunes developed to help identify a particular tune. The name was chosen by the compiler of the tune book or hymnal or by the composer. The majority of names have a connection with the composer and many are place names, such as Aberystwyth or Down Ampney. Most hymnals provide a hymn tune index by name (alphabetical) and a hymn tune index by meter. In some instances a particular text and tune have an almost exclusive partnership with each other, such as Reginald Heber's text \\"Holy, Holy, Holy!\\" and John Bacchus Dykes's tune Nicaea. In other instances a text may be used with a variety of tunes, such as \\"O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing\\" sung to any of Lyngham, Oxford New, Arden, Lydia, Richmond, Azmon, or University. In yet other instances a tune may partner several texts, such as Dix for \\"As with Gladness Men of Old\\", \\"Christ, Whose Glory Fills the Skies\\", \\"God of Mercy, God of Grace\\", \\"Lord, to You Immortal Praise\\", and \\"For the Beauty of the Earth\\". By contrast, in Germany and Scandinavia, tune names were not typically used even when a hymn tune was used for more than one text. The custom in such cases was to use part of the first line of the first text with which the tune was associated as a name for the tune: for example Lasst Uns Erfreuen (\\"Let us rejoice\\" / All Creatures of Our God and King), Gelobt Sei Gott (\\"[May] God be praised\\" / Good Christian men, rejoice and sing) and Was lebet, was schwebet (O Worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness). Renaming of tunes occurs from time to time, when a tune is chosen to be printed in a hymnal. When chorales were introduced in England during the eighteenth century, these tunes were sometimes given English-style tune names. The Ravenscroft Psalter of 1621 was the first English book which specified, by name, which tune should set each text. This followed the procedure used for the first time in the 1616 Scottish Psalter. In this early time of defining text/tune marriages, editors of different psalters were apt to use different names for the same tune. For example, The French Tune, in the Scottish Psalter (1564), was the same tune as Dundee in the Ravenscroft Psalter. Common practice nowadays is for the composer of a tune to name it. Performance Typically, worship services in churches and synagogues include hymns which are sung by the congregation, accompanied by organ, or piano, and/or sometimes by guitars or other instruments. Details of performance vary depending on the designated style of the service, or by the hymns themselves. Some hymns specify unison singing, and other hymns are sung in parts (usually soprano, alto, tenor, bass). It is common practice for a congregation to sing all the hymns in unison, but in some traditions part singing is encouraged. Sometimes, especially on longer texts, variety in the performance is introduced. Varied performance practices may include: * varied harmonization for a stanza * descant added by sopranos, above the melody * \\"Fauxbourdon\\" with the melody sung by tenors, and the harmonies sung by the other parts * a modulation (usually for the last stanza) into the next higher key Other possibilities for varied performance can be invited through explanation either in the service bulletin or through verbal instruction by the pastor or the minister of music. Combining some or all of these and can add interest to singing while enhancing the sense of the text. For example: * a stanza sung only by the choir * a stanza sung only by the congregation * a stanza sung only by men * a stanza sung only by women * a stanza sung only by the left half of the sanctuary * a stanza sung only by the right half of the sanctuary, etc. Some hymn tunes lend themselves to being sung in canon. History =Origins= The Book of Psalms has sometimes been called the first hymn book. Some psalms are headed with instructions relating to their musical performance, music to which they were \\"married,\\" even though no music is included with the texts. Psalters contained metrical versifications of the psalms. Using a regular meter, authors would translate the psalms into the vernacular, and create versions which could be set to music for the people to sing. St. Paul encourages Christians to \\"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord\\" (), \\"[s]peaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord.\\" (). In 313 AD, the Emperor Constantine issued the Edict of Milan, which \\"... gave the Christians the right to practice religion openly.\\" At that time the language of the people was Latin. Use of Latin continued in the Roman Catholic Church long after it ceased to be the vernacular. By the time of Martin Luther in the early 16th century, the singing was still in Latin but was done by choirs of priests and monks, although the choirs sometimes included a few lay musicians as well. Hymnals evolved from psalters, in that hymns are songs for the congregation and choir to sing, but go beyond metrical recasting of only psalm texts. In early hymnals, only texts were printed. By the mid 18th century, hymnal editors began marrying particular tunes, by name, to individual texts. A century later, in the 1861 (first) edition of the English Hymns Ancient and Modern, for the first time, the music was printed with its text on the hymnal page. Many marriages from that book became and remain ecumenically endorsed, including those where a tune was composed and appeared in print for the first time in that 1861 edition. Heber's text, \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\" had first appeared in Selection of Psalms and Hymns for the Parish Church of Banbury, 3rd edition, 1826. Nicaea (1861) was written by J. B. Dykes to set it \\"for the first edition of Hymns A & M.\\" =The Reformation= As part of his efforts at reform, after Martin Luther prepared a version of the Mass in Latin, he prepared a version in German, adapting parts of the liturgical texts of the Mass as chorales in the vernacular which could be sung and understood by the congregation. Luther arranged the music for some of these by adapting the music of existing plainsong melodies; he set other texts to newly composed tunes composed by others, or by himself. An example of the latter is the tune he composed for his German paraphrase of Psalm 46, \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\"). Nicholas Temperley wrote in The Hymn Tune Index that Luther \\"wished his congregations to take part in the singing, but in general they failed to do so\\" and \\"It was the Calvinist, or 'Reformed', branches of Protestantism that succeeded in establishing congregation hymn singing in worship.\\" Luther (1483–1546) posted his theses against Roman Church practices, particularly \\"indulgences\\", in 1517, which signalled the start of the Reformation, \\"...but six or seven years passed after the inception of his Reformation before he gave his thought to hymns.... Luther wished to refine the worship of the Church by excluding what he thought were needless complications while retaining, through the use of music, the essential spirit of Christian devotion as enshrined in the church's tradition.... The year 1524 saw the first official Luther hymnals.\\" Luther wanted the congregation to participate in singing, with German texts sung to tunes straightforward enough for ordinary people to sing. \\"Luther himself wrote many new religious texts to be used with well-known German folk songs. Vom Himmel hoch is one of these.\\" Luther was a gifted and well-trained musician. He composed and found hymn tunes which were accessible for ordinary people to sing, and \\"... at the same time he encouraged church choirs to continue the tradition of polyphonic motets within the Lutheran Mass. He used various textures and styles of music in ways which were most appropriate and effective for each.\\" Luther also adapted the music of existing plainsong melodies as hymn tunes. Families enjoyed singing hymns in parts in their homes, for the family's enjoyment and edification, but unison singing was the custom in church. The Reformed Church and the (French) Genevan Psalter were the result of work by John Calvin (1509–1564). His profound reverence for the biblical text \\"...caused him to insist that public praise in church should be confined to the language of the Bible, adapted to the minimum extent required for congregational singing. He was \\"... the architect of the tradition of metrical psalmody.\\" Calvin heard Lutheran hymn singing while he served Minister of the Reformed Church of Strasbourg (1538–41). In fact, Routley says, \\"[M]etrical psalmody was really born [in Strasbourg] rather than in Geneva.\\" Clement Marot (c. 1497–1544) was a French Court poet in Strassbourg, who had begun setting psalms in metrical versions before Calvin met him. Although Marot remained a Catholic, Calvin included Marot's psalm versions in the Psalter. The first Genevan Psalter, 1542, contained six psalms by Calvin and 30 by Marot. The Genevan Psalter of 1562 contained all 150 psalms, and included the works of Calvin's successor, Theodore de Beza (1509–1565). Calvin did not approve of free religious texts (hymns) for use in church; the Bible was the only source of texts he approved (exclusive psalmody). Calvin endorsed only singing of metrical psalm texts, only in unison, only a cappella, with no harmonization and no accompanying instruments of any kind. Tunes for the metrical psalm versions came from several men, including Louis Bourgeois (c. 1501 – c. 1561), and Claude Goudemil (c. 1525–1572). There were 110 different meters used for the texts in Calvin's Psalter, and 125 different tunes to set them. The music was very difficult; the long tunes were hard for ordinary people to grasp. But later adaptations (and simplifications) of these tunes have added to current day hymn tunes repertoire. =English hymnody= The earliest English psalters included a few tunes in regular meters, which could be used to sing all the psalms in the psalter. Which tune was sung was determined by the fit of the meter. The Ravenscroft Psalter of 1621 was the first English book which \\"married,\\" specified by name, which tune should set each text. In that early time of defining text/tune marriages, editors of different psalters sometimes used different names for the same tune. For example, The French Tune, in the Scottish Psalter (1564), is the same tune as Dundee in the Ravenscroft Psalter. Routley states that metrical psalmody was actually the first English Protestant hymnody. England's Reformation began when King Henry VIII separated the English church from the Catholic Church in Rome in 1532. King Henry's heir was King Edward VI, who ascended to the throne in 1547. Thomas Sternhold (d. 1549), Groom of the Royal Wardrobe at the end of Henry VIII's reign and during Edward VI's, \\"...began metricizing psalms for the edification of the young new king (ten years old when he came to the throne in 1547: sixteen when he died in 1553).\\" Sternhold's work paralleled Marot's efforts in the French Court; Sternhold's \\"...strong puritan strain moved him to replace with sacred songs the trivial secular music that was the Court's normal entertainment; this led him to versify certain Psalms in the ballad metre that would enable them to be sung to tunes already known.\\" (Forest Green, Kingsfold, etc.). The ballad meter, \\"which Sternhold used very nearly without variation,\\" had 4 iambic lines of 14 syllables, which breaks down to 8686 8686 (our Double Common Meter DCM or CMD). Also, a simpler \\"half length\\" tune evolved, now described as common meter (CM = 8686). The English aimed at a Psalter of all 150 psalms, virtually all in ballad meter. Sternhold started the task, writing a total of 37 by the time he died, when John Hopkins took over the work. .... In the year of [Sternhold's] death, a little book without music containing 44 psalms was published, of which 36 were by Sternhold and eight by his collaborator John Hopkins (d. 1570). Progress on the Psalter was interrupted when King Edward died in 1553, and his elder half sister Mary became queen. She tried to reinstate Catholicism as the State religion. Churchmen whose lives were threatened fled to the Continent, some ending up in Geneva, where they encountered the 1551 Genevan Psalter and the congregational singing which it supported. When Elizabeth I ascended the throne after her sister's death in 1558, the exiled churchmen returned to England, bringing them an Anglo-Genevan Psalter containing all the psalms plus a few tunes to set them, along with their desire to add congregational singing to church services. At that point work continued with the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter, adding psalms to it from the Anglo-Genevan Psalter. The Complete Psalter was published in 1562 by John Daye. \\"It is at this point important to remember that all these versions of the Psalter, up to and including 1562, were published for private use. There was not, by 1562, strictly a 'Church of England' that could authorize the use of it in church.\\" The question of \\"authorization\\" of the Sternhold and Hopkins Psalter for use in church services is discussed at length in John Julian's Dictionary of Hymnology; actually, the psalter was used in church whether it was ever officially authorized or not. \\"Few books have had so long a career of influence. With the growing Puritanism psalm-singing came to be esteemed the most divine part of God's public service.\\" =Later developments= Books did not print the music with texts in hymnals until the middle 19th century. Tunes were printed separately in tune books. Some of those printed in America in the 19th century (for example, Lowell Mason's, or George Root's) use four staff systems. The tune name, but no composer credit, appears above each tune. The melody of the tune appears in the tenor (fauxbourdon), often with the first stanza words, printed above the tenor staff. During the decade 1791–1800, more than 8,000 hymn tunes were printed in Great Britain and between 7,000 and 8,000 were printed in the United States; during the decade 1801–1810, about 11,000 hymn tunes were printed in Great Britain, while more than 15,000 were printed in the United States. The total number of hymn tunes published with English-language texts in publications from 1535 up to and including 1820 is recorded as 159,123. The early Methodist movement provides an example of early hymnals published in editions that contained only texts. The co-founders, John Wesley and his brother Charles Wesley, published several text-only collections, culminating in A Collection of Hymns, for the Use of the People Called Methodists, in 1780. John Wesley published tune books separately, culminating in Sacred Harmony, in 1780. In 1786, with the fifth edition of the text-only Collection, Wesley indicated at the head of each hymn the tune to which he intended it to be sung. Among the tunes in Sacred Harmony that are still in use are Derby, Helmsley, and Savannah. Accompanists to hymn singing had a tune book, a volume with a collection of tunes, most without words, the exception being the occasional lyric when underlay of words to the music was ambiguous. An example of this was The Bristol Tune Book. As more people became musically literate, it became more common to print the melody, or both melody and harmony in hymnals. Contemporary practice in the U.S. and Canada is to print hymn tunes so that lyrics underlie the music; the more common practice in the UK is to print the hymn tunes on one page, and the hymn text either below, or on facing pages. Among twentieth-century developments was the publishing of The English Hymnal in 1906 under the music editorship of Ralph Vaughan Williams. More recently, ethnic hymns and tunes have been included, descants have been added for some hymns, freer song-like styles have been accepted, and accompaniments by guitar and/or other instruments have been notated.

The regiment was created in 1881, as the Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Royal Berkshire Regiment), by the amalgamation of the 49th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot and the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot. In 1921, it was renamed the Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales's). The regiment saw active service in the Second Boer War, World War I and World War II. On 9 June 1959, the Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) was amalgamated with the Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh's) to form the Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire) which was again amalgamated, on 27 July 1994, with the Gloucestershire Regiment to create the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. Like its predecessor regiment, however, this was on 1 February 2007, merged with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment, the Royal Green Jackets and The Light Infantry to form a new large regiment, The Rifles. History =Formation and antecedents= The Berkshire Regiment was formed as part of the reforms carried out by Edward Cardwell and Hugh Childers, Secretaries of State for War in the late nineteenth century. The first stage, under Cardwell in 1873, introduced a \\"localisation scheme\\". This saw the United Kingdom divided into \\"Brigade Districts\\" consisting of a county or counties. Each district was assigned two regular infantry battalions, one of which would be on foreign service while the other was on home service. The home-based battalion was to provide drafts to the battalion on foreign duty as required. County militia regiments were also to be linked with the regular battalions, with all sharing a single depot in the brigade district. It was announced that a depot was to be built at Reading, Berkshire, which would serve a district comprising the County of Berkshire. The two line battalions which were to be linked were the 49th and 66th Regiments of Foot, along with the Berkshire Militia. On 1 July 1881, the reforms were completed under Childers, with the formation of The Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Berkshire Regiment), consisting of the following battalions: * 1st Battalion (formerly the 49th (Princess Charlotte of Wales's) (Hertfordshire) Regiment of Foot). The regiment had been raised in 1743, and had been granted the title \\"Princess Charlotte of Wales's\\" in 1816.\\"His Royal Highness the Prince Regent has been pleased, in the name and on behalf of his Majesty, to approve of the 49th (or the Hertfordshire) Regiment being in future styled the 49th (or Princess Charlotte of Wales's) Regiment, retaining its County Title.\\" * 2nd Battalion (formerly the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot). The regiment had been raised in 1758. * 3rd (Militia) Battalion (formerly the Royal Berkshire Militia) * 1st Volunteer Battalion (formerly the 1st Berkshire Rifle Volunteer Corps, formed in 1859). \\"Battle of Tofrek\\" In 1885, following its service at the Battle of Tofrek, the regiment was granted \\"Royal\\" status, to become The Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Royal Berkshire Regiment).\\"The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve ... of the Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Berkshire Regiment), being in future designated Princess Charlotte of Wales's (Royal Berkshire Regiment), in recognition of the gallant conduct of the 1st Battalion of the Regiment, in the action at Tofrek, near Suakin, on the 22nd March, 1885.\\" On 19 March 1896 the regiment, under Major Massard, was called in by the Penzance Borough Police and Cornwall County Constabulary to help quell disorder during the Newlyn riots. They arrived by train in Penzance at around 4pm and took temporary barracks in the town. Two hours later their assistance was requested by the Superintendent in charge and they assisted police in occupying the pier at Newlyn long enough to see in the arrival of . The 1st Battalion was posted at Gibraltar from February 1900 to October 1902. The 2nd Battalion was posted to South Africa in February 1898 and stayed there throughout the Second Boer War (1899–1902), leaving for Egypt in November 1902. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised nationally, with the former becoming the Territorial Force and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and one Territorial battalion.These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve), with the 4th Battalion at St Mary's Butts in Reading (since demolished) (Territorial Force) =The First World War= Cap badge of the Royal Berkshire Regiment as shown on a First World War grave at Vouziers military cemetery The regiment, in common with the rest of the British Army, saw a huge expansion during the First World War and many service battalions, for war service only, were created from volunteers for Kitchener's New Armies. Most battalions would see active service in the trenches of the Western Front in Belgium and France. Regular Army The 1st Battalion was a Regular Army unit and was serving with the 6th Brigade, part of the 2nd Division and served with the British Expeditionary Force when it was sent to Belgium in 1914. They fought in the Battle of Mons, the Marne and the First Battle of Ypres, where the old regular British army was virtually wiped out and could have been said to have found its grave there. In 1915 during the Battle of Loos, 2nd Lieutenant Alexander Buller Turner of the 3rd Battalion, attached to the 1st, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. In 1916 Lance corporal James Welch, also of the 1st Battalion, was awarded the Victoria Cross as well. The 2nd Battalion was also a Regular Army unit and was serving in India on the outbreak of war and was recalled to Britain, where, with other Regular units also stationed abroad, it helped form the 25th Brigade and was attached to the 8th Division. They came to the Western Front in late 1914 and served there for the rest of the war. Territorial Force The Territorial Force saw a considerable expansion and raised the 1/4th, 2/4th and 3/4th battalions. The 1/4th Battalion was part of the South Midland Brigade of the South Midland Division. In 1915 it was designated the 145th Brigade, 48th (South Midland) Division. They served on the Western Front until 1917 when they were transferred to Italy. The 2/4th Battalion was formed at Reading, Berkshire, as a duplicate of the 1/4th Battalion and served in the 184th Brigade, part of the 61st (2nd South Midland) Division and, like the majority of the British Army, served on the Western Front during the war. The 3/4th Battalion was raised in 1915 as a 3rd-Line duplicate of the 1/4th Battalion. The 3/4th remained in Britain for the war supplying drafts and replacements to the other Territorial Force battalions. Kitchener's Army The regiment also raised many service battalions during the war, specifically for war service only. The 5th (Service) Battalion was part of the First New Army, part of Kitchener's Army, and joined the 35th Brigade attached to the 12th (Eastern) Division. They saw their first action in 1915 at Loos. Then, in 1916, the battalion fought at the Battle of Albert and Pozières in 1917. In 1918 the 5th Battalion was transferred to the 36th Brigade, still with 12th Division. The 6th (Service) Battalion was formed as part of Kitchener's Second New Army and joined the 53rd Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division and fought at the 1916 Albert battle, Delville Wood and the Battle of Thiepval Ridge. Then, in early 1918, the 6th (Service) Battalion was disbanded in France due to a manpower shortage where all infantry brigades were reduced from four to three infantry battalions to make up for the shortage and the men of the disbanded 6th were sent to the 1st, 2nd and 5th battalions. The 7th and 8th (Service) battalions were both formed in September 1914 as part of Kitchener's Third New Army and both joined the 26th Division. The 7th Battalion joined the 78th Brigade and moved to Salonika to fight the Bulgarian Army on the Macedonian front in the battles of Horseshoe Hill and Doiran in 1917 and ended the war in Macedonia. The 8th Battalion transferred in 1916 to the 1st Brigade, 1st Division, a Regular Army formation, where they fought in many of the terrible slaughterhouse battles of the war such as the Battle of Aubers Ridge Loos and Passchendaele, the epitome of trench slaughter. They ended the war in Le Cateau, France. During the Battle of Loos, the 8th Battalion attacked Hulluch village and a platoon managed to fight its way into the village, capturing two German field guns and a number of machine guns. 2nd Lieutenant Lawrence was awarded the Military Cross for his exploits. The 9th (Reserve) Battalion was originally a service battalion of Kitchener's Fourth New Army formed in 1914 until 1915 when it became the 37th Training Reserve Battalion and supplied the service battalions overseas with replacements. The 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th battalions were all formed in 1916, serving in France and were transferred to the Labour Corps and remained there for the rest of the war. After the war Bromsgrove cemetery, memorial for Private Bishop Throughout the war, the regiment lost 6,688 men killed and many thousands more wounded. After the Great War, as it was and still is known, was over the 3rd Battalion was disembodied and all the service battalions were disbanded as well as the Territorial Force which was reformed in 1920 as the Territorial Army. Miles Dempsey served with the regiment after being commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in 1915, where he was awarded the Military Cross for bravery. He would serve with distinction in the Second World War in France, North Africa, Sicily, Italy and North-Western Europe and became the Commander of the British Second Army from D-Day onwards. In 1921 the titles switched to become the Royal Berkshire Regiment (Princess Charlotte of Wales's). =The Second World War= The Second World War also saw an expansion for the regiment but not quite to the extent of the Great War. However, casualties were still heavy and the Royal Berkshire Regiment lost 1067 men killed including 974 other ranks and 93 officers killed in action with many hundreds more wounded.History of the Royal Berkshire Regiment 1920–1947, Blight, G. 1953 W/16 8987 Regular Army The 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Miles Dempsey, was still assigned to the 6th Infantry Brigade in the 2nd Infantry Division, part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) that was sent to France in 1939 after war was declared. They took part in the Battle of France in 1940 and were evacuated during the Battle of Dunkirk. However, the 2nd Division, 1st Royal Berkshires included, was sent to India in 1942, after the Imperial Japanese Army conquered much of Burma in early 1942. The battalion and division became part of the Fourteenth Army under the command of Lieutenant General William \\"Bill\\" Slim. The battalion fought in the Arakan Campaign in late 1942 until June 1943 and later were destined to play a crucial role in the Battle of Kohima the following year, with B Company leading the battalion in relieving the 4th Royal West Kents during the siege. The often savage fighting in Kohima, nicknamed Stalingrad of the East, turned the tide of the campaign in Burma. Entering the Battle around 20 April 1944, the 1st Royal Berkshires continued to fight the Japanese for a further three weeks in horrendous conditions, and suffered just over 50% casualties. From 15 April 1944 to 24 June 1944 the battalion had 52 killed, 290 wounded and 15 missing (357 casualties overall) from an initial fighting strength of 691. The battalion continued to fight in the Burma Campaign, seeing action in the Battle of Meiktila and Mandalay until being withdrawn to India in April 1945. Lieutenant General Sir Montagu Stopford, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the British 12th Army, inspects a guard of honour mounted by men of the 1st Battalion, The Royal Berkshire Regiment, during the formal ceremony in Rangoon where General Heitarō Kimura and his staff handed over their swords to staff officers of the 12th Army. As in the First World War, the 2nd Battalion was stationed in India at the outbreak of war and remained there for the duration. From the outbreak of war until August 1940, the battalion served with the 6th Indian Infantry Brigade. In January 1943 the battalion was assigned to 98th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 19th Indian Infantry Division and, like the 1st Battalion, also served in the Burma Campaign under the command of Fourteenth Army. A memorial plaque stands at the entrance to a pagoda near the top of Mandalay Hill. It was erected in honour of the men of the 2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment who fought and died there and reads; The battalion continued to fight the Japanese until the war against Japan ended on Victory over Japan Day. Territorial Army The 4th Battalion was a 1st Line Territorial Army unit serving in 145th Infantry Brigade, 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division. It was sent overseas to France in early January 1940 with the rest of 48th Division and, in February, it was exchanged for the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment to the 8th Infantry Brigade, part of 3rd Infantry Division under Major-General Bernard Montgomery before, with the rest of the BEF, being evacuated to Dunkirk. After Dunkirk the battalion was posted away and was not part of a field unit but trained intensively for future combat operations, gaining a high standard of fitness and morale. However, in December 1940 the battalion transferred to the 148th Independent Infantry Brigade and served with it in Northern Ireland, and remained with the brigade for the rest of the war. In mid-1942 the battalion moved to Wrotham in Kent and then became an officer cadet training unit for the rest of the war. The 5th (Hackney) Battalion was, in 1937, redesignated from the 10th (Hackney) Battalion, London Regiment when the London Regiment itself was broken up in 1937. On the outbreak of war the battalion was serving with its duplicate 7th Battalion in the 161st (Essex) Infantry Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division. Originally the battalion was an ordinary infantry battalion until 1942 when they were converted to No. 8 Beach Group and played an important part in the Normandy landings where they landed with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division at Juno Beach on D-Day itself and were responsible for the landing ground. Although still technically a Beach Group they served as infantry in the Battle of Normandy where they were down to 16 officers and 136 other ranks by August 1944 and were disbanded. In February 1945 they were reformed and re-designated as a Bank Group and assisted the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division across the Rhine in March 1945. After this they served as normal infantry until the battalion was disbanded in June 1945. Throughout its existence, the battalion was allegedly nicknamed The Hackney Ghurkhas. The 6th Battalion was raised in 1939 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 4th Battalion, and served in the 184th Infantry Brigade, 61st Infantry Division. The battalion remained with the 61st Division throughout the war. By the time of Victory in Europe Day the battalion was based in Sussex and were re-training several hundred men of the Royal Artillery into infantrymen. Soon afterwards, the battalion were preparing for a move to the Far East to join the 1st and 2nd battalions but the Japanese surrendered before the battalion arrived. The 7th (Stoke Newington) Battalion was raised in 1939 as a 2nd Line duplicate of the 5th (Hackney) Battalion and joined its parent battalion in the 161st Infantry Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division. The battalion spent most of its existence moving around the United Kingdom, mainly in East Anglia, on guard duties and training and preparing for a possible German invasion of England. The battalion never served overseas and was disbanded in September 1942. Hostilities-only The 8th (Home Defence) Battalion was formed in November 1939 from No. 84 Group, National Defence Companies. The battalion was created specifically for home defence purposes and consisted mainly of men mainly in a lower medical category and younger soldiers unable to be conscripted and eventually it grew to 2,000 strong. In 1940 the younger soldiers of the battalion were split and formed a new 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion and in 1941 the 8th Battalion was re-designated as the 30th Battalion. The 9th Battalion, nicknamed The Farmer's Boys, was formed in June 1940 at Reading and joined the 213th Infantry Brigade (Home) and spent the war in the United Kingdom. The battalion was disbanded in December 1943 due to an increasing shortage of manpower in the Army. Members of the 10th Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment climbing the heights of Calvi Risorta in the invasion of Italy, October 1943 The 50th (Holding) Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment was another war-formed unit of the regiment raised in May 1940 in Reading, Berkshire. The 50th (Holding) Battalion's job was to 'hold' men who were homeless, medically unfit or those awaiting orders, on courses or returning from abroad. In late 1940 it was renumbered the 10th Battalion and, in early 1941, joined the 168th (London) Infantry Brigade, 56th (London) Infantry Division. In late 1942 the division was sent to the Middle East. The 168th Brigade was detached to fight with the 50th Division which was understrength after heavy fighting and casualties at Gazala in North Africa. The 168th Brigade took part in Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, and then fought in the Italian Campaign back with the 56th Division. The division came under the command of the US Fifth Army under Mark W. Clark for the landings at Anzio, where the battalion endured some of the bitterest fighting of the war so far. Fighting at Anzio was similar to the trench warfare of the Great War. However, due to the severe shortage of manpower in the British Army at the time, and the battalion being the most junior in 56th Division, the battalion was broken up in March 1944 and the men were used as replacements for other infantry units of 56th Division. The 70th (Young Soldiers) Battalion was raised in 1940 from the younger personnel of the 8th (Home Service) Battalion and mainly consisted of soldiers around the age of 18-19 who had volunteered for the British Army. The battalion spent most of its time guarding areas of the United Kingdom against German invasion and grew to a size of well over 1,000 officers and men, with the hope that they would be able to see action overseas. However, the unit was disbanded in July 1943, as with all such units of other regiments, due to the British government lowering the age of conscription to 18 earlier in the year, and the young soldiers were sent to the front-line battalions of the regiment. =Amalgamation= After the Second World War, all hostilities-only battalions were disbanded, and the 4th and 6th battalions were amalgamated. In 1959 the regiment was amalgamated with The Wiltshire Regiment (Duke of Edinburgh's) into The Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment (Berkshire and Wiltshire) . In 1994 the DERR was amalgamated with the Gloucestershire Regiment to form the Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment. The RGBWR had a short existence before again being amalgamated with other regiments to form The Rifles. Regimental museum The Rifles Berkshire and Wiltshire Museum is based in Salisbury.

They are also found in northern parts of Madagascar. Greater dwarf lemurs live in forests and dry scrub areas. The head and body of the greater dwarf lemur can range from 167 to 264 millimeters in length, and 164 to 600 grams. Their tails can range from 195 to 310 millimeters in length.Cooper, A. 2000. \\"Cheirogaleus major\\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed July 25, 2012 at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Cheirogaleus_major.html Greater dwarf lemurs are nocturnal. During the day, they sleep in nests of twigs, leaves, and grass, or hollowed sections of trees padded with dry leaves. Their diet consists mostly of fruits, flowers, and nectar. Flower nectar is an important part of the diet from November to December. Sometimes they will also eat insects and small vertebrates. During the dry seasons they will store fat in their tail and become dormant. Its fur is short, dense, grey or reddish brown, and there are dark circles of fur around the eyes. At the end of the wet season the tail will become somewhat swollen with fat. The greater dwarf lemur is preyed upon by the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) during the dormant season. Other predators the Malagasy tree boa (Boa manditra), the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus), and it is thought probably by the Fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) as well, since the latter preys on other lemurs. Locomotion The greater dwarf lemur is an arboreal quadruped, it moves along the horizontal branches with a regular gait pattern involving all four limbs. They are not agile leapers. Mating Mating occurs in October with births from November to February. Mothers build nests to give birth to their offspring that average in height from six to twelve meters. They generally give birth to twins. Mothers carry infants in their mouths. Vocalization Greater dwarf lemurs are not very vocal. They make soft calls to locate others. Taxonomy upright Between 2000 and 2009, populations of dwarf lemur around Tamatave, Tampira, Mahambo, Ancaya, Ambodivoangy, and Fesi Malendo were known as a separate species, the greater iron-gray dwarf lemur (Cheirogaleus ravus). It was described as having a pelage coloration that is iron-gray with brownish tones, a vague dorsal stripe, white feet, a tail with a white tip, and dark ears that are either naked or sparsely covered with hair. However, in 2009, Groeneveld et al. demonstrated genetically that Cheirogaleus ravus was a synonym of Cheirogaleus major, so the greater iron- gray dwarf lemur is no longer recognized as a species.

Its Māori names include (\\"little complaining bird\\"), , and (\\"twitch\\", after its bobbing motion). Outside New Zealand it is sometimes known as the rockwren or South Island wren to distinguish it from the unrelated rock wren of North America. The rock wren is currently restricted to alpine and subalpine areas of the South Island; subfossil bones show it once lived in the North Island as well. It is a poor flier and highly terrestrial, feeding in low scrub, open scree, and rockfalls. The rock wren and rifleman are the only two surviving New Zealand wrens; the rock wren's closest relatives were the extinct stout-legged wrens, followed by the extinct bushwren. Its numbers are declining due to predation by introduced mammals.  Description  Xenicus gilviventris, showing distinctive green, yellow, and grey colouring. The rock wren is a very small, almost tailless bird that prefers to hop and run on its long legs, and uses its rounded wings to fly only short distances. Males are 16 g, females 20 g. Males are greenish with yellow flanks and a pale underside, females tend to be browner, although the degree of difference between the sexes varies geographically.  Distribution and habitat  This species is currently confined to alpine and subalpine zones (900–2500 m altitude)http://www.nzbirdsonline.org.nz/species/rock-wren of the Southern Alps, the Tasman Mountains of Northwest Nelson, and the Victoria Range of Westland, all in the South Island; it is New Zealand's only truly alpine bird. Subfossil remains suggest before Polynesian settlement it was also found in lowland forest and in the North Island. Its current alpine distribution is a habitat where few rodents can survive, full of sheltering rocks and dense vegetation.Rock wren nestTheir preferred habitat is close to the treeline, amongst rockfalls, scree, fellfield, and low scrub. Rock wrens, unlike many alpine birds, do not migrate to lower elevations in winter; instead, they seem to shelter and forage in rockfalls beneath the snow layer.  Behaviour  The rock wren is a poor flier, rarely flying more than 2 m off the ground or for distances of more than 30 m. It prefers to hop and run with distinctive bobbing and wing flicks. Its call is three high-pitched notes, and pairs sometimes duet. Pairs maintain a year-round territory, and work together to build a large enclosed nest with an entrance tunnel. The nest is lined with feathers, often from other species of birds. Guthrie-Smith recovered 791 feathers from one nest in the 1930s, most from weka, but including some kiwi, kakapo, kea, and kereru. (Rock wrens are such assiduous collectors of feathers that their nests have been checked for kakapo feathers, to determine if those endangered parrots are in the area.) Around three eggs are laid in late spring and incubated for three weeks. Chicks take about 24 days to fledge and are fed for at least 4 weeks. Rock wrens mostly eat invertebrates on the ground, but will sometimes take berries and seeds, and even nectar from flax flowers. Conservation Rock wren in its preferred habitat Writing in the 1930s, Herbert Guthrie-Smith declared, This was not to be. Since European settlement, rock wrens have become more patchy in their distribution; a study of over 2,100 sightings between 1912 and 2005 showed the area they inhabit had declined significantly since the 1980s. In the Murchison Mountains, rock wren showed a 44% decline in abundance over 20 years. The main threats to rock wrens are stoats and mice, which eat their eggs and young: A 2012–13 study in the upper Hollyford showed that most rock wren nests were being preyed upon by stoats. Predator trapping improved daily survival rates, egg hatching and fledgling rates of rock wrens. The long-term effect of climate change on their alpine habitat is also a threat, as warmer temperatures will allow rats to move higher into the mountains. In 2008–2010, a total of 40 rock wrens were translocated to Secretary Island, an 8140 ha rodent-free island in Fiordland, the third-tallest island in New Zealand. In 2010 a survey located 12 unbanded rock wrens, indicating they were successfully breeding. References Further reading * *BirdLife International (2006) Species factsheet: Xenicus gilviventris.

His nickname was \\"Le Most\\", for his piano skills. Life Born in Épinal, France, Peiffer was raised within a musical family, with his father and uncle playing the violin and the organ, respectively. Starting piano at age nine, he studied under Pierre Maire, a student of Nadia Boulanger, and quickly demonstrated his brilliance by being able to play back long sections of classical music by ear. After winning the 1st Prize in Piano at the Paris Conservatory, Peiffer began his professional career at the age of twenty, playing with Andre Ekyan and Django Reinhardt. During World War II, he joined the French resistance after he witnessed the execution of a friend by the Gestapo in the streets of Paris. Soon afterwards he was captured, and was incarcerated for over a year. In the early 1950s he began a successful career, playing with Django Reinhardt, leading his own quintet, composing film soundtracks, and achieving notice in the clubs of Paris, Monte Carlo and Nice, and eventually becoming nationally renowned. He moved to Philadelphia in 1954 with his wife Corine and daughter Rebecca. The subsequent loss of his third daughter (his first was from a previous marriage with singer Monique Dozo) profoundly affected him, resulting in \\"Poem for a Lonely Child\\". The year 1962 saw the birth of his first son (and final child), Stephen. During his first years in America he achieved considerable success, performing at Carnegie Hall, Birdland, and the Newport Jazz Festival. He recorded for the EmArcy, Decca and Laurie labels. During this time, critic Leonard Feather compared his playing with that of Art Tatum. Peiffer released his last commercial album in 1965 and, after having kidney surgery a few years later, restricted himself to performing and teaching, mainly in Philadelphia. His students included Uri Caine, Sumi Tonooka, Tom Lawton, and Don Glanden. His last major appearance was at the 1974 New York/Newport Festival at Carnegie Hall. He died on 7 September 1976, aged 53.

History The regiment was organized at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by the consolidation of Robert's Battalion Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery (redesignated Companies C, D, and F), Segebarth's Battalion Marine Artillery (Companies A, B, G, H, K, and L), and the 1st Battalion Pennsylvania Heavy Artillery (Company E). Companies I and M were organized in Philadelphia. Recruiting finished on February 17, 1863, with Joseph Roberts as colonel, R. V. W. Howard as lieutenant colonel, and John A. Darling as major. The regiment was sent to Fort Monroe in Virginia, except for Company H, which was sent to Baltimore, Maryland. During the Suffolk Campaign, companies A, B, F, and G were sent to Suffolk and participated in the siege. During the Gettysburg Campaign, Company H was assigned to the Second Division of the Army of the Potomac's Cavalry Corps and was present at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2 and 3 1863. It fought at the East Cavalry Battlefield on July 3. After the campaign, the company returned to Baltimore, where it remained for the remainder of the war. In the spring of 1864, the regiment was above its authorized strength, so its surplus men were organized into the 188th Pennsylvania Infantry. Shortly afterwards, it received more recruits, so it remained above strength. During the Siege of Petersburg, Companies D, E, G, and N were assigned to the Army of the James to serve in light artillery batteries and to work on various parts of the fortifications. Detachments from various companies were assigned to the Naval Brigade, which fought along the rivers around Richmond and Petersburg during 1864 and 1865. Company I was selected as the guard company for the headquarters of the Army of the James. Following the capture of Richmond, the regiment was reassigned to Fort Monroe, where it provided the guard for Jefferson Davis' imprisonment there. Companies A and B were mustered out at Fort Monroe on July 11, 1865; company H was mustered out at Baltimore on July 25; and the remaining companies were mustered out at Fort Monroe on November 9.

It succeeded two prior hotels, a wooden and then a masonry Occidental Hotel. Sinking Ship parking lot, 2007 It was built in 1890 from the ashes of the Great Seattle Fire and served as a hotel until early in the 20th Century. By the time neighboring Smith Tower was completed in 1914, the Seattle Hotel had become an office building. It was demolished in the early 1960s and the site is now home to the Sinking Ship, a multistorey car park. Precursor: The Occidental Hotel, I and II (1861–1889) Memorial services for assassinated U.S. president James Garfield in Occidental Square September 27, 1881 in front of the Occidental Hotel Before the Seattle Hotel rose in 1890, there was the Occidental Hotel. The first Occidental, which opened in 1861, was a wooden building. Twenty years later, on September 26, 1881, it held a memorial service for President James Garfield, who had died five days earlier from injuries sustained when he was shot in July. The triangular 2nd Occidental Hotel after a snowfall in 1884 In 1883, the wooden structure was torn down and John Collins built a bigger, grander one in the same location. Construction bids were accepted in February 1883. Construction for the new hotel began on about May 1, 1883. The architect was Donald Mackay. The Puget Sound National Bank, which was co-founded by Jacob Furth, was located in the Occidental Hotel. The new hotel lasted just four years, before burning down in the Great Seattle Fire on June 6, 1889. The second Occidental Hotel, like the Seattle Hotel, was also triangular-shaped. Description The Seattle Hotel was a triangular-shaped building (much like the Flatiron Building in Manhattan, New York), with its narrow face located at the junction of James and Yesler. It stood five stories high and for much of its existence bore the inscription \\"1890\\" above the fifth-story window, signifying the year it was completed. Designed in the Victorian architectural tradition and clad in white cement, it stood in stark contrast to its dark brick and stone neighbors. Significance of its Demolition  Damaged by the 1949 Olympia earthquake and abandoned by 1961, the Seattle Hotel was torn down and replaced with a parking garage, derisively called the \\"Sinking Ship\\" as part of the initial stages of an urban-renewal plan that would level all the old buildings in the district. That was as far as the plan went. The old hotel's demise kicked off a preservation movement spearheaded by the likes of Alan Black, Victor Steinbrueck and historian/author Bill Speidel which led to a revival of the Pioneer Square district. By 1970, with its buildings refurbished, a historic district area including the Square was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Harvey had fifteen film credits as an editor, and he directed thirteen films. The second film that Harvey directed, The Lion in Winter (1968), earned him a Directors Guild of America Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Directing. He died in November 2017 at the age of 87.Anthony Harvey, Film Director And Editor, Dies At 87 Harvey's career is also notable for his recurring work with a number of leading actors and directors including Terry-Thomas, Peter Sellers, Katharine Hepburn, Peter O'Toole, Richard Attenborough, Liv Ullman, Sam Waterston, Nick Nolte, the Boulting Brothers, Anthony Asquith, Bryan Forbes and Stanley Kubrick. Biography Harvey was born in London in 1930 but his father died when he was young and he was raised and took his name from his stepfather, actor and writer Morris Harvey. He began his screen career as an actor while a teenager and made his first film appearance playing Ptolemy, the younger brother of Cleopatra (played by Vivien Leigh, an acquaintance of his step-father) in the film version of George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra (1945), where he recalled that he was \\"looked after\\" by star Claude Rains. Harvey gained a scholarship to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art but, although he worked for a time in repertory theatre, realised that he was not likely to be successful as an actor and decided to move into film-making. =Career as film editor= Harvey was taken on as an assistant editor by the Boulting Brothers (Roy Boulting and John Boulting). He soon found himself in high demand, and went on to edit a sequence of British films in the 1950s and early 1960s, developing fruitful working relationships with several major directors of the period including Anthony Asquith, Roy and John Boulting, Bryan Forbes, Martin Ritt, and UK-based American director Stanley Kubrick. Harvey's first film as editor was the Anthony Asquith short On Such A Night (1956), followed by his first feature assignment, the Ealing war comedy Private's Progress (also 1956), starring Richard Attenborough and Terry-Thomas. His subsequent work as an editor included Roy Boulting's comedies Brothers in Law (1957) and Happy Is the Bride (1958), the drama Tread Softly Stranger (1958) directed by Gordon Parry, the political comedy Carlton-Browne of the F.O. (aka The Man in the Cocked Hat, 1959), and I'm All Right Jack (also 1959). Harvey edited the industrial drama The Angry Silence (1960), directed by Guy Green, and the Anthony Asquith comedy The Millionairess (also 1960), which starred Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren. Harvey worked with both Bryan Forbes and Stanley Kubrick, editing Forbes' drama The L-Shaped Room and Kubrick's adaptation of Nabokov's Lolita (both 1962). His collaboration with Stanley Kubrick began after Harvey called Kubrick up out of the blue and asked if they could work together. After Lolita, he worked with Kubrick again on Dr Strangelove (1964). This was followed by the spy thriller The Spy Who Came in from the Cold (1965), directed by Martin Ritt from the John le Carré novel. In a 2014 conversation with broadcaster Walker Vreeland, Harvey recalled his working relationship with Kubrick: :\\"Every moment I spent with him, I never learned so much about movies. He said that when you have a close-up and you have two wonderful actors, don't go backward and forward, leave the actor that was marvellous and stay on that shot. It's a much better way of putting a film together. :\\"We had a great friendship. He used to sack me every now and then and say, 'Go home and don't come back!' But the next day, [it was] 'Hello, Tony, how are you?' It was a sort of joke. Because I was quite determined to put my stuff that I cut on the movie. :\\"He said that I was becoming more impossible than Peter Sellers. He said, 'You'd better hurry up and direct, then you won't be so annoying in the cutting rooms.'\\" Harvey's last two credits as an editor were his own directorial debut Dutchman (1966) and The Whisperers (1967), his last collaboration with Bryan Forbes. =Career as director= Harvey's first feature film as a director was a monochrome shorter subject, the intense one-hour race relations drama Dutchman (1966), which depicts a fateful encounter between a black man and a white woman on the New York subway. Although it did not receive a wide release, it was nominated for the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Actor Peter O'Toole was impressed by Harvey's work on Dutchman and brought it to the attention of the film's producer Joseph E. Levine. O'Toole advocated that Harvey should direct the screen adaptation of James Goldman's play The Lion In Winter (1968). Harvey gained the respect and consent of the film's other star, Katharine Hepburn, leading to her third Oscar and a lifelong friendship. \\"Much as I absolutely worshipped her work, I sometimes thought she rather overdid it,\\" Harvey recalled. \\"So I said, 'Kate when you’re simple, you’re devastating.' She was adorable about it\\". The film was a critical and commercial success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture; Hepburn won the Academy Award for Best Actress (with Barbra Streisand, the only time this has been a joint award) and Harvey was nominated for a Best Director Oscar and won Best Director at the Golden Globes, as well as several other major awards. It was the screen debuts for actors Anthony Hopkins and Timothy Dalton. Harvey later fondly recalled the deep familial rapport that developed among the cast, and considered the production among the best experiences of his career. However, \\"when you have success so early, everything after that is under great scrutiny. You wonder what the hell to do next\\", he once said. Harvey turned down the chance to direct both Love Story (1970) and Cabaret (1972). \\"I let them go out of total indecision,\\" he said. \\"It was a terrible mistake\\". Harvey's third directorial project was the ill-fated uncompleted film A Glimpse of Tiger (1970), an oddball romantic comedy about a pair of bohemian con-artists living in New York City. It was scripted (from his second novel) by writer Herman Raucher. The film rights to the project had been purchased by rising American star Elliott Gould, who was also producing, as part of a two- picture deal he had struck with Warner Brothers Pictures, but problems arose as soon as filming started. Gould's behaviour became bizarre and unpredictable (he was rumoured to be using drugs heavily), co-star Kim Darby reportedly became so afraid of Gould that she hired bodyguards to protect her from him, Gould repeatedly clashed with Harvey over his direction, and Gould later claimed that large sums of money were embezzled from the production and that he was threatened by armed men. As a result of the turmoil, when Gould failed to appear on set after an ultimatum from the studio, Warner Bros shut the production down after just four days of shooting; Gould was then blacklisted by Hollywood, and his career languished for two years until he re-emerged in Robert Altman's The Long Goodbye (1973). Harvey's next feature was an adaptation of another James Goldman play, the offbeat comedy-drama They Might Be Giants (1971) starring George C. Scott and Joanne Woodward, in which Scott plays Justin Playfair, a wealthy but eccentric retiree who is convinced that he is Sherlock Holmes. It was not a success, according to Harvey because Universal significantly altered the film's last half-hour. Harvey reunited with Hepburn for the acclaimed made-for-TV adaptation of Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie (1973) which also featured Sam Waterston and Michael Moriarty. His next film was the lavish historical drama The Abdication (1974) starring Liv Ullmann, about the abdication of Queen Christina of Sweden, which co-starred Peter Finch and featured a score by Nino Rota. It was followed by a more modern period piece, The Disappearance of Aimee, starring Faye Dunaway and Bette Davis, which explored the mysterious 1926 temporary disappearance of American celebrity evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. Players (1979) was a romantic drama set in the world of international tennis, in which a rising tennis star (Dean Paul Martin) falls for an older woman (Ali MacGraw) who is engaged to a wealthy man (Maximilian Schell) whom she does not love. The film is also notable for appearances (as themselves) by a number of real-life tennis stars of the period including Pancho Gonzalez, Guillermo Vilas, John McEnroe and Ilie Nastase. Harvey's next film was a Western drama, Eagle's Wing (1980) starring Martin Sheen, Harvey Keitel and Sam Waterston. The following year Harvey reunited with Liv Ullmann for the romantic drama Richard's Things (which also featured British actress Amanda Redman) and in 1981 he directed the American sequences of The Patricia Neal Story, a tele-movie starring Glenda Jackson which detailed the real-life struggles faced by Oscar-winning actress Patricia Neal, who at the height of her career suffered a devastating stroke which left her unable to speak, and the efforts of her then husband Roald Dahl (played by Dirk Bogarde) and their friends and family to help her recover. Harvey directed another American tele-movie, Svengali (1983) which was based on the George Du Maurier thriller Trilby; it starred Peter O'Toole as an ageing singer who discovers and nurtures a new talent (Jodie Foster) with whom he becomes romantically involved but whom he seeks to completely control. Harvey's last cinema film was another offbeat black comedy, Grace Quigley (1984), which reunited him with Katharine Hepburn (making her final top-billed role in a feature film). The story concerns an elderly New York woman who witnesses a murder committed by a top hit-man (Nick Nolte), whom she then blackmails into killing some of her friends. After a ten-year interval, Harvey returned to direct the romantic comedy television movie This Can't Be Love (1994). This was to be both Harvey's last film and the last of his four collaborations with Katharine Hepburn, and it was also the only time that Hepburn ever worked on screen with the film's co-star Anthony Quinn. The plot concerns the romantic travails of a former glamour movie-star couple who had a brief, stormy marriage in the 1940s, who reunite decades later to find that their relationship is as difficult as ever. Harvey though remained in Hepburn's high regard, and was one of the few colleagues she remained in contact with near the end of her life. \\"A real English gentleman and a brilliant director, one of the best I’ve ever worked with\\", she told Ronald Bergan in 2001. In 2014 Harvey told Walker Vreeland that he decided to stop making films after the producers interfered in the making of This Can't Be Love: :\\"I'll tell you exactly why I stopped. Because the people who were making the film, during the editing stage, told me they weren't quite happy with the pauses of Miss Hepburn. And they sent an editor - a very nice man - who was in ... the mail room, and he did a few snips on the Movieola - and I thought that was outrageous. I said, 'Do you know I cut so-and-so, and this and that, and 'Dr Strangelove', and I really don't want someone else fooling with my film. Those pauses with Kate Hepburn were very unique, so leave them alone ... ' :\\"...I felt even though one shouldn't get knocked out by what people say - you have to overlook it and on to the next one - I felt it was very strange to let a guy - a perfectly nice fellow in the office downstairs - to come and chip along on my film. I just thought it was unspeakable. And I tried to explain to the producers and they just laughed ... I just thought it was ridiculous, so I just went in and redid the whole schedule and they knew nothing about it. I just thought it was ridiculous.\\"Walker Vreeland, Interview with the Artist, Episode 30, Anthony Harvey Harvey moved to Long Island in the 1990s and he died there on 23 November 2017, aged 87.

Oxford University Press, 2007. . p xxi Epigraphs The novel begins with two quotations. > What demon possessed me that I behaved so well? – Thoreau > Give me continence and chastity, but not yet. — Augustine of Hippo The first epigraph points to the notion that Dubin has written a biography of Thoreau and also alerts the reader to the moral complexities that the novel explores. The second connects the novel with themes of promiscuity and spiritual struggle for which Augustine is famous. Plot summary William Dubin of Vermont is living the comfortable life of an accomplished writer. Though his marriage to Kitty is slightly timeworn, it is stable and loving. While researching the biography of D. H. Lawrence, he meets twenty-three-year- old Fanny and begins an affair with her. Predictably, the consequences of this act rock Dubin's life and invite the reader to draw parallels with similar events in the lives of the writers Dubin is researching. Reception Over the years, Dubin's Lives has been well-received, and has consistently garnered attention and sales since it was published. As of 2017, the novel is still in print. Upon its publication, initial reviews were enthusiastic.

Since its inception, the bank has cumulatively provided over ¥150 billion (around $23 billion) loans with average loan size of ¥500,000 to its clientele, and over 90% of which are peasants-turned entrepreneurs. As its clientele often lacks the assets required by larger banks when applying for a loan, TLB grants and disburses loans secured through guarantors, which collateral form accounts for 99% of the total loans outstanding. In addition to that, the number of loan officers is almost half of the total staff, due to the labor-intensive nature of SME lending business. By the end of December 2011, TLB had eight branches, two village and town banks and 50 sub-branches which are mainly spread out around the Yangtze River Delta region. History It was founded in 1993 with a registered capital of RMB 1 million and 7 staff, positioning itself at the very beginning as the small-and-micro-enterprise(SME) financing service provider and being upgraded from credit union to commercial bank in 2006, is one of few complete private holding city commercial banks in China. Although the credit union was performing adequately in the first half decade since its birth, it was struggling in the fiercely competitive Chinese market. As a result, the bank focusses its market strategy on small and mid-sized business. By the end of December 2011, TLB had RMB 39 billion of deposit balance and RMB 26 billion of outstanding loans with NPL ratio of 0.58%, thereof SME loans took up more than 90%. When starting operations in 1993, the bank did not have many other choices than going into the niche of SME. Nowadays, the interdependence of its market and the bank is seen just as between “a fish and water”. Business TLB has a strongly decentralized structure and delegates many authorities to the branches and sub-branches. Approximately more than 80% of all loan decisions can be made at sub-branch level. Although TLB was performing adequately in the inception phase, it was struggling in the fiercely competitive Chinese market. As a result, the bank developed and provided some distinct and unique products to SMEs. as regards SME’s lack of collaterals required by bigger banks, TLB serves them special loans secured only through guarantors to attract more clients. Up to now, this kind of loans take up more than 90% of total loans outstanding in terms of volume and 99% in terms of number of clients. Besides, TLB has been striving to improve and enhance its customer-centered service culture as what it is conveying in practice through convenient and efficient service providing. It is a practice and also a rule reflecting the efficiency that loans for old client should be granted and disbursed within 3 hours once the application is presented whereas loans for new ones within 3 days. SME lending methodology The client assessment is mainly based on non-financial analysis. The client managers are very well connected in their allotted communities and therefore can use different informal channels to obtain information on the client. Cross checking with community heads, neighbors, persons with influence, friends and family is common. The main famous investigation approach adopted to solve effectively the client information asymmetry problem in SME lending is called “3 Factors-3 Documents”. The former refers to the assessment of the client’s integrity, products and property. The latter refers to the collection and analyzing of three consumption/supply-related figures, such as the electricity and water meter or the customs documentation stating the volumes exported within recent months. Besides, another efficient method used widely to assess and control credit risk is “3 inquiries and 5 double-checkings”. 3 inquiries encompass making inquiries about client’s credit report, client black list in MIS and client cash flow status. And 5 double-checkings include double checking the eligibility of applicant’s legal entity, business operations, historical credit records, asset and liability situation as well as the loan purpose.

Through her career, she has explored adult education and higher learning, discussing methodology and pedagogy in terms of remediation and advancement in the university system. Education and career Cross earned her B.S. in mathematics from Illinois State University in 1948. She then earned an M.A. in psychology and a PhD in social psychology, both from the University of Illinois in 1951 and 1958 respectively. Cross was awarded with several honorary doctorate degrees throughout her academic career. Before pursuing her education in psychology, she taught math at Harvard Community High School in Harvard, Illinois. Upon completing her PhD, Cross began a career heavy in both administrative and academic duties. From 1959 to 1964, she was a dean of students at Cornell University; in 1964 she became the director of College and University Programs at Educational Testing Service at Princeton, New Jersey; in 1966 she began working for the University of California, Berkeley, both as a research educator for the Center for Research and Development of Higher Education and as a research scientist and psychologist for Educational Testing Service. In 1980, she started teaching at the Harvard Graduate School of Education as a professor of education. By 1988, she had returned to Berkeley to teach as a professor of higher education, until her retirement in 1995. She maintains emeritus status at UC Berkeley. Research Approaching educational research from the vantage of a mathematician and social scientist, Cross has come to conclusions about student ability and experience perhaps different from those of some of her contemporaries. Though as caring for the remedial and new college student as colleagues such as Mina Shuaghnessy, Cross finds different reasons for these students’ underachievement. She notes that much of the discrepancies in the students’ incoming test scores lies in lack of effort and motivation. Pointing out that some of these “remedial” students come from privileged backgrounds, she argues that the problem cannot be a mere matter of the school system failing to reach the underprivileged. While Cross upholds the belief that everyone should have access to higher education, she counters that remedial programs used as an effort to “catch up” the students falling behind is not the answer. Instead, she argues that institutions should point students toward excellence in areas perhaps alternative to the traditional academic curriculum of the university setting, such as vocational or semiprofessional training. K. Patricia Cross Award Since 1996, Cross has sponsored the K. Patricia Cross Future Leaders Award, recognizing graduate students demonstrating promise as future leaders in higher education. The award is currently administered by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Bibliography Some Selected Works By K.

Andy McNab has written about Nick Stone in nineteen different books. Nick has undertaken many missions including kidnapping a powerful Russian Mafia lord and killing a money-laundering Algerian business man. Nick Stone left the SAS in 1988, soon after the shooting of three IRA volunteers in Gibraltar. Once working for British Intelligence as a 'K' on deniable operations, he also briefly worked for an American agency. Now he roams the world as somewhat of a mercenary just trying to keep his head above water. Early novels are accounts of assassination and intrigue filled with tradecraft and detail. Later novels, while still detailed, deal with more social topics such as White slavery/prostitution, government corruption, war profiteering, Human rights and torture with Nick never having answers to these complicated topics, but normally just bearing witness. Biography Nick Stone's story is depicted as a traumatic one. He grew up in England with parents who he feels did not care about him. They hardly ever spent family time together, and they never did anything to make his childhood happy. His father is also suggested to have been a very violent man, and certain passages hint that Nick was a victim of child abuse at his hand (one passage says that his father locked him in the garden shed on a stormy night and left him there, in the dark and on his own, until the morning). Another says that his stepfather used to beat him, just because he liked to do it. His mother did nothing to stop this abuse, Stone stating that all she did was let it happen, then give him a Mars Bar afterwards. Nick treated his home as a waiting room until he could leave and, when he finally did, he signed up to the Army, eventually being recruited into the SAS. The characters' name and early years were allegedly based on those of a teenage acquaintance of McNab last known working as a postman in Dartford. In Remote Control he is asked if he is still married to which he replies 'no I divorced her', she is also mentioned in subsequent novels as a gauge on women's effect on him, such as references in Crisis Four where his newfound love for fellow operative Sarah is listed on his file at MI6 for the reason he divorced his wife. After the murder of a fellow SAS soldier and his family, Nick becomes the sole guardian of their seven-year-old daughter Kelly, and the two went on the run from unidentified pursuers, unaware of who was the real target. In Dark Winter, Stone unearths a doomsday threat against the populations of New York, London and Berlin and finds himself facing an unspeakable trade-off; the life of someone he loves, against those of millions he doesn't even know. In 1987, Stone was involved with a mission in Gibraltar to prevent three PIRA members from detonating a bomb there. This mission involving Stone is a reenactment of the actual event, Operation Flavius. This ended with the shooting in public of all three PIRA officials. This event drove Nick to retire from the SAS at some point between then and 1995. He says in Aggressor that his last job with the Regiment was supervising and being actively involved in the infamous Waco siege in 1993, he also refers to carrying out operations in the Gulf War in some of his books, mirroring Andy McNab's own SAS career. It seems he was being used for unofficial jobs by British Intelligence as early as 1995, as the character Sarah in Crisis Four encouraged him to approach them He has had many chapters in his life and led a path that has taken him all over the world (including The Congo, Bosnia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Southern France, Ireland, Ulster, Switzerland, Malaysia, Georgia, Great Britain, the United States, Syria, Algeria, Libya, Italy, Dubai, Russia, Gibraltar, Finland, Moldova and Denmark), mostly under order of \\"The Firm\\" but others out of pure bad luck or personal quests for revenge or escapism.

Their first show was at the Teragram Ballroom supporting Lawrence in Los Angeles. Herstand currently fronts the band (under the alias \\"Copper Jones\\"). Brassroots District puts on immersive, 1973 concert experiences around Los Angeles.  Music Industry Blogging  In Spring 2012, Herstand started the music business blog Ari's Take to help independent musicians build careers without the help of a record label. The blog is based on Herstand's experience as a touring musician (with 600+ shows) as well as his work as an artist manager. Ari's Take articles have been featured on, CD Baby, Music Connection, TuneCore, Digital Music News, Roland, American Songwriter, and Hypebot. Herstand was a staff writer for Digital Music News from December 2013 through August 2018.  Author  Herstand is the author of How To Make It in the New Music Business: Practical Tips on Building a Loyal Following and Making a Living as a Musician. The foreword was written by Derek Sivers. The book was released on December 20, 2016 with Liveright Publishing. Music Connection Magazine reviewed the book and wrote \\"How to Make It in the New Music Business might well be the best “how to\\" book of its kind.\\" Andy Grammer said \\"There is a great divide between what the young musician thinks being a rock star is and what actually working as a musician entails. Ari fills in the blanks with his light hearted yet blunt demeanor. He's the informed older brother most of us never got in this crazy, confusing industry.\\" Derek Sivers said \\"This is the single best book on the current music business. An absolute must read for every musician.\\" Jack Conte said \\"Ari is at the front of the front. He gets it.

He gives a tremendous amount of information. Anyone wanting to make music for a living should read this, period.\\"  Independent Music Professionals United and AB5  Beginning in November 2019, Herstand worked to \\"save his industry from detrimental changes\\" that would be brought about by California bill AB5. AB5 \\"reclassifies musicians from independent contractors to employees… to hire a musician for a recording session… [a recording artist would have to] become their employer… get worker's comp insurance, unemployment insurance, set up a payroll company.\\" Herstand wrote a blog post that went viral, founded Independent Music Professionals United, gathered 185,000 signatures on a petition, and met with Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez and Senate Majority leader Robert Hertzberg. On April 17, a compromise measure was announced to exempt the vast majority of musicians from most provisions of AB5. The bill, AB2257, which Herstand helped write, was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 4th, 2020  UnCancelled Music Festival  When the Coronavirus shut down the live music industry, Herstand, along with friends Andrew Leib and Ashley Maietta launched UnCancelled Music Festival. All shows were livestreamed from artists' homes on the platform Stageit where fans had to purchase tickets to attend the performances and could tip the artists during the show. The festival engaged music venues to book talent and curate stages so they could participate in the revenue generated to help keep the businesses afloat during the crisis. Part of the proceeds were donated to the Recording Academy's Emergency Financial Assistance fund MusiCares. The festival featured over 350 artists from around the globe including Colbie Caillat, Betty Who, Josh Radnor, Waxahatchee, Beach Bunny and Snail Mail. The festival organizers look to keep the festival active until live music returns to music venues.

Qi, Hebi, the headquarters of the Weixinist Church in Henan. Weixinism is a Chinese salvationist religion. In the study of comparative religion, the East Asian religions or Taoic religions, form a subset of the Eastern religions. This group includes Chinese religion overall, which further includes Ancestral Worship, Chinese folk religion, Confucianism, Taoism and so-called popular salvationist organisations (such as Yiguandao and Weixinism), as well as elements drawn from Mahayana Buddhism that form the core of Chinese Buddhism and East Asian Buddhism at large. The group also includes Japanese Shintoism and Korean Sindoism (both meaning \\"Ways of Gods\\" and identifying the indigenous shamanic religion and ancestor worship of such peoples), which have received influences from Chinese religions throughout the centuries. Chinese salvationist religions have influenced the rise of Korean and Japanese new religions—for instance, respectively, Jeungsanism and Tenriism; these movements draw upon indigenous traditions but are heavily influenced by Chinese philosophy and theology. All these religious traditions, more or less, share core Chinese concepts of spirituality, divinity and world order, including Tao, 道 (\\"Way\\", Pinyin dào, Japanese tō or dō and Korean do) and Tian, 天 (\\"Heaven\\", Japanese ten and Korean cheon). Early Chinese philosophies defined the Tao and advocated cultivating the de, \\"virtue\\", which arises from the knowledge of such Tao.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. pg 32. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Some ancient schools merged into traditions with different names or became extinct, such as Mohism (and many others of the Hundred Schools of Thought), which was largely absorbed into Taoism. East Asian religions include many theological stances, including polytheism, nontheism, henotheism, monotheism, pantheism, panentheism and agnosticism. East Asian religions have many Western adherents, though their interpretations may differ significantly from traditional East Asian religious thought and culture. The place of Taoic religions among major religious groups is comparable to the Abrahamic religions found in Europe and the Western World as well as across the Middle East and the Muslim World and Dharmic religions across South Asia.Sharot, Stephen. A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion. Pp 71–72, 75–76. New York: NYU Press, 2001. . Terminology Despite a wide variety of terms, the traditions described as \\"Far Eastern religions\\", \\"East Asian religions\\" or \\"Chinese religions\\" are recognised by scholars as a distinct religious family.de Groot, J.

Further complications arise from the inconsistent use of many terms. \\"Tao religion\\" is often used for Taoism itself,Vrijhof, Pieter Hendrik & Waardenburg, Jean Jacques.

Harmony: Radical Taoism Gently Applied. Pg 13. Trafford Publishing, 2002. . Believed to be the influence that keeps the universe balanced and ordered, the Tao is associated with nature, due to a belief that nature demonstrates the Tao.Martinson, Paul Varo A theology of world religions: Interpreting God, self, and world in Semitic, Indian, and Chinese thought. Pp 168–169. Augsburg Publishing House. 1987. . Similar to the negative theology of Western scholars, the Tao is compared to what it is not.This concept of being unable to accurately describe the Tao is common among East Asian religions and Taoist writings. For example, \\"The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao; The name that can be named is not the eternal name\\"; first lines of the Tao Te Ching. It is often considered to be the source of both existence and non-existence.See Wuji and Taiji for more information about \\"non-existence\\" and \\"existence\\" in East Asian religious thought. The Tao is often associated with a \\"virtue\\" of being, the de or te. This is considered the active expression of Tao.Sharot, Stephen. A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion. Pp 77–78, 88. New York: NYU Press, 2001. . Generally, those religions closer to Taoism explain de as \\"integrity\\" or \\"wholeness\\", while those faiths closer to Confucianism express this concept as \\"morality\\" or \\"sound character\\".Yao, Xinzhong.

Taoism consists of a wide variety of religious, philosophical and ritual orders. There are hermeneutic (interpretive) difficulties in the categorisation of Taoist schools, sects and movements.Mair (2001) p. 174 Taoism does not fall strictly under an umbrella or a definition of an organised religion like the Abrahamic traditions, nor can it purely be studied as a variant of Chinese folk religion, as much of the traditional religion is outside of the tenets and core teachings of Taoism. Robinet asserts that Taoism is better understood as a way of life than as a religion, and that its adherents do not approach or view Taoism the way non-Taoist historians have done.Robinet (1997), pp. 3–4, 103. In general, Taoist propriety and ethics place an emphasis on the unity of the universe, the unity of the material world and the spiritual world, the unity of the past, present and future, as well as on the Three Jewels of the Tao (love, moderation, humility).Leaman, Oliver. Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy . Pg 111. Routledge, 1999. . Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of wu wei (\\"non-action\\"), spontaneity, relativity and emptiness.Slingerland, Edward Gilman.

A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion. Pg 78. New York: NYU Press, 2001. . Traditional Chinese Taoist schools accept polytheism, but there are differences in the composition of their pantheon.Segal, Robert Alan. The Blackwell Companion to the Study of Religion. Pg 50. Blackwell Publishing. 2006. . On the popular level, Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the head deity. Professionalised Taoism (i.e. priestly orders) usually presents Laozi and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. pg 41. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Worship of nature deities and ancestors is common in popular Taoism, while professional Taoists put an emphasis on internal alchemy. The Tao is never an object of worship, being treated more like the Indian concept of atman.LaFargue, Michael. Tao and Method: A Reasoned Approach to the Tao Te Ching. Pg 283. SUNY Press. 1994. =Confucianism= Temple of Confucius in Liuzhou, Guangxi. Confucianism is a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is commonly associated with legalism, but actually rejects legalism for ritualism.Yao, Xinzhong. An Introduction to Confucianism. pp 191–192. Cambridge University Press. 2000. It also endorses meritocracy as the ideal of nobility.Smart, Ninian. World Philosophies. Pp 66. Routledge (UK). 2000. . Confucianism includes a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness.De Bary, William Theodore & Tu, Weiming. Confucianism and Human Rights. Pg 149. Columbia University Press. 1998. . Confucianism recognises the existence of ancestral spirits and deities, advocating paying them proper respect.Sharot, Stephen. A Comparative Sociology of World Religions: virtuosos, priests, and popular religion. Pp 46, 85. New York: NYU Press, 2001. . Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic Neo-Confucianism was built.Huang, Siu-chi. Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods. Pg 5. Greenwood Press, 1999. . Neo-Confucianism was developed in reaction to Taoism and Chan Buddhism. It was formulated during the Song dynasty, but its roots may be traced to scholars of the Tang dynasty. It draw Buddhist religious concepts and Taoist yin yang theory, as well as the Yijing, and placed them within the framework of classic Confucianism.Huang, Siu-chi. Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods. Pp 11–12, 63–64, 106. Greenwood Press, 1999. . Despite Neo- Confucianism's incorporation of elements of Buddhism and Taoism, its apologists still decried both faiths.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. pg 52–53. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Neo-Confucianism was an officially endorsed faith for over five centuries, deeply influencing all of East Asia.Flew, Antony G. A Dictionary of Philosophy. Pg 62. St. Martin's Griffin. 1984. . New Confucianism is a modernist Confucianism, which accommodates modern science and democratic ideals, while remaining conservative in preserving traditional Neo-Confucianist positions. The influence of New Confucianism prompted since Deng Xiaoping became the leader of China in 1978 and helped cultural exchanges between China and Taiwan. =Shintoism= Two women praying in front of a Japanese Shinto shrine. Shintoism is the ethnic religion of Japan. Shinto literally means \\"Way of the Gods\\". Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values.Ono, Sakyo. Shinto: The Kami Way. Pp 97–99, 103–104. Tuttle Publishing. 2004. Taoist influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self- mastery. Ritual cleanliness is a central part of Shinto life.Ono, Sakyo. Shinto: The Kami Way. Pp 51–52, 108.

Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world. Pg 254. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. . The authorship of the Tao Te Ching, the central book of Taoism, is assigned to Laozi, who is traditionally held to have been a teacher of Confucius.Hansen, Chad D. A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought: A Philosophical Interpretation. Pp 202, 210. Oxford University Press. 2000. . However, some scholars believe that the Tao Te Ching arose as a reaction to Confucianism.Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions: An Encyclopaedia of the World's Faiths. Pg 167. I.B. Tauris. 1997. . Zhuangzi, reacting to the Confucian-Mohist ethical disputes casts Laozi as a prior step to the Mohists by name and the Confucians by implication. However, secular scholars usually consider Laozi and Zhuangzi to have been mythological figures.Boltz, William G. \\"Lao tzu Tao te ching.\\" Early Chinese Texts: A Bibliographical Guide, edited by Michael Loewe. pg 270. Berkeley: University of California, Institute of East Asian Studies. 1993. (Laozi)Birrell, Anne. Chinese Myths. Pp 16–17. University of Texas Press. 2000. . (Zhuangzi) Early Taoist texts reject Confucian emphasis on rituals and order, in favour of an emphasis on \\"wild\\" nature and individualism. Historical Taoists challenged conventional morality, while Confucians considered society debased and in need of strong ethical guidance.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. pg 39. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Interaction with Indian and South Asian religions A painting of Confucius presenting a young Buddha to Laozi. The entry of Buddhism into China from India was marked by interaction and syncretism with Taoism in particular.Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. Taoism and Chinese Religion. pg 46. University of Massachusetts, 1981. Originally seen as a kind of \\"foreign Taoism\\", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.Prebish, Charles. Buddhism: A Modern Perspective. Pg 192. Penn State Press, 1975. . Chan Buddhism was particularly modelled after Taoism, integrating distrust of scripture, text and even language, as well as the Taoist views of embracing \\"this life\\", dedicated practice and the \\"every- moment\\".Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China). Pp 68, 70–73, 167–168. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. . In the Tang period Taoism incorporated such Buddhist elements as monasteries, vegetarianism, prohibition of alcohol, the doctrine of emptiness, and collecting scripture into tripartite organisation. During the same time, Chan Buddhism grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism.Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China). Pp 166–167, 169–172. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. . The Buddha's \\"Dharma\\" seemed alien and amoral to conservative and Confucian sensibilities.Dumoulin, Heinrich, Heisig, James W. & Knitter, Paul. Zen Buddhism: A History (India and China). Pp 189–190, 268–269. World Wisdom, Inc, 2005. . Confucianism promoted social stability, order, strong families, and practical living, and Chinese officials questioned how monastic lifestyle and personal attainment of enlightenment benefited the empire. However, Buddhism and Confucianism eventually reconciled after centuries of conflict and assimilation.Moore, Charles Alexander. The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture. Pp 133, 147. University of Hawaii Press. 1967. . Ideological and political rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another.Markham, Ian S. & Ruparell, Tinu . Encountering Religion: an introduction to the religions of the world. pp 248–249. Blackwell Publishing, 2001. . They did share some similar values. All three embraced a humanist philosophy emphasising moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously.Windows on Asia Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University.

But Hübner had misidentified Fabricius' species, which was in reality a tineid moth known today as Nemaxera betulinella. In addition to this case of mistaken identity, the white- shouldered house moth as discussed by Hübner had actually been named Tinea lactella by J. N. C. M. Denis and Ignaz Schiffermüller in 1775. Earlier still, Carl Linnaeus had described the white-shouldered house moth as Phalaena (Tinea) sarcitrella in 1758, but neither Denis and Schiffermüller nor Hübner did remember it. Later authors, who were aware of the earlier descriptions, supposed the taxon of Denis and Schiffermüller or that of Linnaeus to be this type of Endrosis.Pitkin, Brian & Jenkins, Paul (2004): Butterflies and Moths of the World, Generic Names and their Type-species – Endrosis. Version of 2004-NOV-05. Retrieved 2010-APR-28. Hübner, however, believed to have identified his white-shouldered house moths correctly with Fabricius' A. betulinella and disregarded T. lactella entirely. Thus, the taxon T. lactella (though not the white-shouldered house moth species as a whole) was not included in Endrosis at the genus' inception, and such a change of type species can only be made by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature – it is not permitted in the rules of zoological nomenclature to prevent the confusion and misinterpretations of scientific names that was frequent before the early 20th century. Over the years, a number of supposed close relatives of the white-shouldered house moth were described. Soon enough, they were all grouped in Endrosis. What remained unclear was how many species there were, and whether any forms stood out. With reports of the species accumulating from all over the world, it was eventually realized that this moth must have tagged along Homo sapiens and spread with human habitation since prehistoric times. In this single global gene pool, few if any current authors recognize more than a single species, E. sarcitrella.Savela, Markku (2009): Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms - Endrosis. Version of 2009-AUG-02. Retrieved 2010-APR-28. =Synonyms= Browns Bay (New Zealand). White-shouldered house moths from the New Zealand population were once considered a separate species E. subditella, but are not recognizably distinct from European specimens.

The historic park is owned and operated by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, on , near Chadds Ford, Delaware County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It is part of the site of the Battle of Brandywine fought on September 11, 1777, during the American Revolution. The Battle of Brandywine covered more than ten square miles, or 35,000 acres. However, the modern park only covers 50 acres which served primarily as the Continental encampment the two days prior to the battle. The battle was a decisive victory for the British and cleared a path directly to the rebel capital of Philadelphia. Brandywine Battlefield Park became a Pennsylvania State Park in 1949 and a National Historic Landmark in 1961. To the north, another part of the battlefield is maintained by Birmingham Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania as \\"Battlefield of the Brandywine Park,\\" or \\"Sandy Hollow Heritage Park.\\" Much of the afternoon's fighting took place between Birmingham Friends Meetinghouse and Dilworthtown. On August 14, 2009, the state closed the battlefield and three other PHMC museums indefinitely due to a lack of funding as part of an ongoing budget crisis.Rujumba, Karamagi \\"Fort Pitt Museum, Bushy Run close due to state budget crisis\\". Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (14 August 2009. The historic site opened again after 11 days, operating under an interim agreement between the PHMC and Chadds Ford Township with the Brandywine Battlefield Associates, or \\"Friends of Brandywine Battlefield\\" who now operate the site with staff and volunteers.Friends of Brandywine Battlefield Website Geography Washington's headquarters at the battlefield Brandywine Battlefield Park is about a half-mile east of Brandywine Creek in southeastern Pennsylvania. Its proximity to Philadelphia, about 30 miles, led directly to the land being the location of a major battle of the American Revolution. The creek itself was a major military obstacle during the 1770s. Brandywine Creek served as a \\"moat\\" that blocked British access to the Schuylkill River and the Continental Congress in Philadelphia. The British Army sought to seize control of Philadelphia, drive the Congress out of the city and thereby bring an end to the war. The area was also a crossroads of the Thirteen Colonies. Control of the roads was crucial to the supply of both the British and Continental Armies. Battle General George Washington moved his troops to the Chadds Ford area to control the high ground, prevent the British Army under the command of General Howe from taking Philadelphia and to avoid being trapped between the British Army on land and the Royal Navy which was positioned on the Delaware River in September 1777. The British had landed at the head of Maryland's Elk River, on the northern end of the Chesapeake Bay near present- day Elkton, approximately 40–50 miles (60–80 km) southwest of Philadelphia and were marching towards Philadelphia. The British grouped forces at nearby Kennett Square. Howe had no intention of mounting a full-scale attack against the prepared American defenses. He instead employed a flanking maneuver similar to those used in the Battle of Long Island. A portion of the army, about 5,000 men under the command of Wilhelm von Knyphausen, were to advance to meet Washington's troops at Chadds Ford, while the remainder, under the command of Lord Charles Cornwallis, were to march north to Jefferis' Ford, several miles to the north, which Washington had overlooked, and then march south to flank the American forces. A map of Brandywine Creek (Christina River) showing the location of Brandywine Battlefield Park September 11 began with a heavy fog, which provided cover for the British troops. Washington received contradictory reports about the British troop movements and continued to believe that the main force was moving to attack at Chadds Ford. The British appeared on the Americans' right flank at around 2 p.m. With Hazen's brigades outflanked, General John Sullivan, tried to reposition his troops to meet the unexpected British threat to their right flank. But Howe was slow to attack the American troops, which bought time for the Americans to position some of their men on high ground at Birmingham Meeting House, about a mile (2 km) north of Chadds Ford. By 4 p.m., the British attacked and quickly gained the ground from the Continental Army. Sullivan then attacked a group of Hessian troops trying to outflank the Americans near Meeting House Hill and bought some time for most of the men to withdraw. But Sullivan's men were cut down by return British fire, forcing them to retreat. At this point, Washington and Greene arrived with reinforcements to try to hold off the British, who now occupied Meeting House Hill. The remains of Sullivan's men held off the pursuing British for nearly an hour but were eventually forced to retreat. The Americans were also forced to leave behind most of their cannon on Meeting House Hill because most of the artillery horses were killed. Knyphausen, on the east bank of Brandywine Creek, launched an attack against the weakened American center across Chadds Ford, breaking through and Wayne's division and forcing him to retreat and leave behind most of his cannon. Armstrong's militia, never engaged in the combat, also decided to retreat from their positions. Further north, Greene sent Colonel Weedon's troops to cover the road just outside the town of Dilworth to hold off the British long enough for the rest of the Continental Army to retreat. Darkness brought the British pursuit to a standstill, which then left Weedon's force to retreat. The defeated Americans were forced to retreat to Chester where most of them arrived at midnight, with some stragglers arriving until morning. The battle cost the British about 89 killed and 487 wounded, while they claimed to have killed 200 Colonials, wounded 750 more, and captured over 400 as well as destroying or capturing 11 of the American artillery guns. Although Howe had defeated the American army, the unexpected resistance he had met prevented him from destroying it completely. The American morale had not been destroyed; despite losing the battle, the Americans had good spirits hoping to fight the British again another day. But neither commander in the battle had proven themselves. Washington had committed a serious error in leaving his right flank wide open and nearly brought on destruction if it had not been for Sullivan, Sterling, and Stephen's divisions that fought for time. Howe had waited too long to attack the American right flank, showing again his lack of killer instincts because he was still afraid of sustaining heavy casualties since the costly victory at the Battle of Bunker Hill two years earlier, and thus allowed most of the American army to escape. British and American forces maneuvered around each other for the next several days with only minor encounters such as the Paoli Massacre on the night of September 20–21. The Continental Congress abandoned Philadelphia, first to Lancaster, Pennsylvania for one day and then to York, Pennsylvania. Military supplies were moved out of the city to Reading, Pennsylvania. On September 26, 1777, British forces marched into Philadelphia unopposed. Park facilities Brandywine Battlefield Park was the site of a thriving farming community until just before the battle. Quaker farmers were getting ready to harvest their crops, plant winter wheat, slaughter beef cattle, hogs, shear their sheep and sell their yearling colts and fillies. The pacifist Quakers were thrust into the center of the battle and much of their farmland, livestock, and crops were destroyed. The American officers seized their farmhouses before the battle and the victorious British officers occupied the Quaker's homes after the battle. These homes have been restored to their 1777 appearance and are open to the public. The Benjamin Ring House is believed to have been used as headquarters by George Washington before the battle. A collection of Quaker style furniture is on display at the house with historical information about the battle and Washington's stay at the house. The Gideon Gilpin House, once the home of a prosperous Quaker farmer and his family, served as quarters for the Marquis de Lafayette before the battle and he was brought back to it when he was wounded in combat.John W. Jordan, ed., A History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania (New York: Lewis Historical Publishing Company, 1914), p. 284. The house was pillaged by the British after the battle. Reenactors portray Hessian, Quaker farmers, and British and Continental soldiers during many special events held at the park during the year. Staff and volunteers provided daily guided tours of the park and battlefield. They also guide hands on activities, give speeches, sponsor seminars, and host open houses. Much of the battlefield is preserved but encroaching suburban sprawl is threatening the park. The park is protected by its status as a National Historic Landmark District, designated as such by the United States Congress in 1997, 220 years after the Battle of Brandywine. Current affairs The Gideon Gilpin House has been restored and preserved in its 1777 appearance. The Benjamin Ring House used by General George Washington, was used on and off until the 1930s, when young local residents accidentally set off a bomb (fire) that destroyed the home. In the 1950s, a new home was built to reflect the time period of the 1770s. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

After the demise of the group, Rinaldi continued to work with The Moment's guitarist Adrian Holder in a succession of bands. He eventually wrote half of the material and briefly took over as the band's vocalist before leaving to focus on Rinaldi Sings, his first solo project, produced in collaboration with music journalist Chris Hunt. Going into the recording studio with Ian Shaw and Paul Bevoir, both former producers of The Moment, Rinaldi set out to make an album of orchestrated pop music, reminiscent of the late nineteen-sixties bubblegum soul of such artists as Love Affair and The Foundations. The first single from the album, a cover version of Tony Christie's \\"Avenues and Alleyways\\", was released by Tangerine Records on 10 May 2004. The album, What's It All About?, was finally released on 21 February 2005, and was described by British newspaper the Daily Mail as an album \\"of time travel pop [that] oozes with fab Sixties kitsch and wouldn't have sounded out of place in a Carnaby Street boutique\\". Several of the album's songs were inspired by films, including \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\". \\"Come Fly With Me\\" was released as a single on 14 March 2005. After touring with his six-piece band throughout 2005, Steve Rinaldi spent much of 2006 writing material for his second album, Bingo. Co- produced by Steve Rinaldi and Paul Bultitude, Bingo was released on 4 August 2008.  Collaborations and session work  Steve Rinaldi has made guest appearances with many other artists, both on stage and in the studio, including The Jetset, Squire, Long Tall Shorty, David Cairns, Mark Joseph, Katie Buckhaven, Ian Page, and with the reformed Secret Affair, with whom he regularly tours. As a session player he has frequently appeared in London's West End and has toured Japan as a member of The Glenn Miller Orchestra. He also played trombone and sang backing vocals on the recording of the Mod Aid 20 charity record \\"Whatcha Gonna Do About It\\", appearing on the recording with Ron Wood, PP Arnold, Ocean Colour Scene's Steve Cradock, Censored, Reg Presley and Chris Farlowe.

Having beaten him and saved Roxanne, Johnny is directed – by Scarecrow – to the carnival where his father was killed. There, he meets Mephisto, who reveals that he was against the Rider all along. In order to summon a portal to Hell and usher in the Apocalypse (but knowing that any efforts using demons would have been thwarted by the Angels), Mephisto sent Ghost Rider on his quest so that the hellfire of his cycle would inscribe the massive geoglyph necessary to summon the portal. After the explanation, Blackheart, whose body was supposed to be hidden by Blade, manages to reawaken itself and escape to find Ghost Rider's and Mephisto's whereabouts. He immediately grows immensely powerful—though is taken down by Johnny. After which, Mephisto then disappears with Blackheart's body and Johnny reunites with Roxanne. Gameplay The game features a system reminiscent to that of God of War and Devil May Cry, even having some of the same controls and style of attacks. Combos are done with bare hands and with the Demonic chain. The overall mood, setting and visual style are very much the same as those in the first installment of Devil May Cry. When on the Hellcycle, Ghost Rider is still capable of performing some of the same chain attacks, and can shoot hellfire. The Game Boy Advance version has some elements of Road Rash and Castlevania. =Alternate characters= After beating the game on certain difficulty levels, bonus character skins can be unlocked. They include Classic Ghost Rider, Ghost Rider 2099, Vengeance, and Blade the vampire hunter. =Blade= If the player chooses to start the game again as Blade, they get slightly changed gameplay. Blade only has his Daywalker Sword for a weapon, he does not have the shotgun or chain-link attacks of Ghost Rider. Combo attacks are much more limited. He also does not replenish health by absorbing flames from the occasional fire-drums scattered throughout the game levels. Instead, Blade can suck the life force from any wounded foe that is a non-boss (readiness is indicated by a circle above their heads). However, during the motorcycle-racing sections, his vehicle can still shoot firebolts, and he can use his sword for melee combat. =PSP racing= The PSP version has an exclusive racing circuit gameplay, which includes not just Ghost Rider and the alternate characters who are playable in storyline, but also Ghost Rider's human form Johnny Blaze, Caretaker, Lilith and Deathwatch. In this gameplay, the racer can use a power icon, which allows them to utilizes their boost, traps and alternate projectiles, similar to Nintendo's Mario Kart series. The racing circuit stage includes Daily Bugle from Spider-Man trilogy franchise. Reception The Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2 versions of Ghost Rider received \\"mixed or average reviews\\", while the PSP version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

They are relatively large regions on the order of 200,000 km² or greater, characterized by distinct bathymetry, hydrography, productivity, and trophically dependent populations. Productivity in LME protected areas is generally higher than in the open ocean. The system of LMEs has been developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to identify areas of the oceans for conservation purposes. The objective is to use the LME concept as a tool for enabling ecosystem-based management to provide a collaborative approach to management of resources within ecologically-bounded transnational areas. This will be done in an international context and consistent with customary international law as reflected in 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.NOAA.gov Although the LMEs cover mostly the continental margins and not the deep oceans and oceanic islands, the 66 LMEs produce about 80% of global annual marine fishery biomass. In addition, LMEs contribute $12.6 trillionCostanza R, d'Arge R, Groots Rd, Farber S, Grasso M, Hannon B, Limburg K, Naeem S, O'Neill RV, Paruelo J and others. 1997. The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital. Nature 387:253-260. in goods and services each year to the global economy. Due to their close proximity to developed coastlines, LMEs are in danger of ocean pollution, overexploitation, and coastal habitat alteration. NOAA has conducted studies of principal driving forces affecting changes in biomass yields for 33 of the 66 LMEs, which have been peer-reviewed and published in ten volumes.NOAA.gov LME-based conservation is based on recognition that the world's coastal ocean waters are degraded by unsustainable fishing practices, habitat degradation, eutrophication, toxic pollution, aerosol contamination, and emerging diseases, and that positive actions to mitigate these threats require coordinated actions by governments and civil society to recover depleted fish populations, restore degraded habitats and reduce coastal pollution. Five modules are considered when assessing LMEs: productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health, socioeconomics, and governance.Olsen SB, Sutinen JG, Juda L, Hennessey TM, Grigalunas TA. 2006. A Handbook on Governance and Socioeconomics of Large Marine Ecosystems. Kingston, RI: Coastal Resources Center, University of Rhode Island. 94 p. Periodically assessing the state of each module within a marine LME is encouraged to ensure maintained health of the ecosystem and future benefit to managing governments.Wang H. 2004. An evaluation of the modular approach to the assessment and management of large marine ecosystems. Ocean Development and International Law 35:267-286.  Modules of Ecosystem Condition  = Productivity = The productivity of a marine ecosystem can be measured in several ways. Measurements pertaining to zooplankton biodiversity and species composition, zooplankton biomass, water- column structure, photosynthetically active radiation, transparency, chlorophyll-a, nitrate, and primary production are used to assess changes in LME productivity and potential fisheries yield.Pauly D, Christensen V. 1995. Primary production required to sustain global fisheries. Nature 374:255-257. Sensors attached to the bottom of ships or deployed on floats can measure these metrics and be used to quantitatively describe changes in productivity alongside physical changes in the water column such as temperature and salinity.Aiken J, Pollard R, Williams R, Griffiths G, Bellan I. 1999.

Plymouth, UK: The Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science. This data can be used in conjunction with satellite measurements of chlorophyll and sea surface temperatures to validate measurements and observe trends on greater spatial and temporal scales. = Fish and Fisheries = Bottom-trawl surveys and pelagic-species acoustic surveys are used to assess changes in fish biodiversity and abundance in LMEs. Fish populations can be surveyed for stock identification, length, stomach content, age-growth relationships, fecundity, coastal pollution and associated pathological conditions, as well as multispecies trophic relationships.Sea Around Us Project at www.seaaroundus.org/ Fish trawls can also collect sediment and inform us about ocean-bottom conditions such as anoxia. = Pollution and Ecosystem Health = Pollution and eutrophication can have significant impacts on ecosystem health and result in changing biomass yields. LMEs are emplaced in an effort to maintain healthy and sustainable conditions in spite of environmental change and global warming. A health ecosystem should maintain a relatively constant metabolic activity level, internal structure and organization, making it resistant to change over time.Costanza R. 1992. Toward an operational definition of ecosystem health. In: Costanza R, Norton BG, Haskell BD, editors. Ecosystem health: New goals for environmental management.

Paris, France: UNESCO. = Socioeconomic = By integrating socioeconomic metrics with ecosystem management solutions, scientific findings can be utilized to benefit both the environment and economy of local regions. Management efforts must be practical and cost-effective.

The most common symptoms are a breast mass, breast pain, and nipple discharge. A majority of breast diseases are noncancerous. Tumor Early warning signs of breast cancer A breast tumor is an abnormal mass of tissue in the breast as a result of neoplasia. A breast neoplasm may be benign, as in fibroadenoma, or it may be malignant, in which case it is termed breast cancer. Either case commonly presents as a breast lump. Approximately 7% of breast lumps are fibroadenomas and 10% are breast cancer, the rest being other benign conditions or no disease.Page 739 in: 8th edition. Phyllodes tumor is a fibroepithelial tumor which can either benign, borderline or malignant. =Breast cancer= Breast cancer is cancer of the breast tissues, most commonly arising from the milk ducts. Worldwide, breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in women, accounting for 25% of all cases. It is most common in women over age 50. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin. Diagnosis may also be made when the cancer is asymptomatic, through breast cancer screening programs, such as mammograms. Outcomes for breast cancer vary depending on the cancer type, extent of disease, and person's age. Survival rates in the developed world are high, with between 80% and 90% of those in England and the United States alive for at least 5 years. Fibrocystic breast changes Also called: fibrocystic breast disease, chronic cystic mastitis, diffuse cystic mastopathy, mammary dysplasia Infections and inflammations These may be caused among others by trauma, secretory stasis/milk engorgement, hormonal stimulation, infections or autoimmune reactions.

Strong and destructive tornadoes form most frequently in the United States, Bangladesh, and Eastern India, but they can occur almost anywhere under the right conditions. Tornadoes also develop occasionally in southern Canada during the Northern Hemisphere's summer and somewhat regularly at other times of the year across Europe, Asia, and Australia. Tornadic events are often accompanied with other forms of severe weather, including strong thunderstorms, strong winds, and hail. The United States recorded more tornadoes during this year than any other year on record, with 1,817 touching down across the country. Synopsis =United States yearly total= January 3 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. February 9 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. March 46 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =March 4–5= On March 4, a large storm system produced 29 tornadoes across Texas into parts of Oklahoma. In addition to the tornadoes, heavy rain caused flooding in the Plains and an unusual derecho produced heavy damage, primarily in Texas. =March 27= April 125 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =April 7 (Ukraine)= A strong F2 (possibly F3) tornado struck the towns of Velikaya Kostromka and Pervoye-Maya in Ukraine on April 7, killing one person and damaging or destroying 130 homes. =April 14 (Bangladesh)= A powerful tornado struck portions of North-Central Bangladesh, killing 111 and injuring nearly 1,500 others. =April 20–24= A powerful tornado struck the town of Utica, Illinois. It was part of an outbreak of 30 tornadoes that formed in eastern Iowa, northern Illinois, and northern Indiana in a short period of time. The Utica tornado caused the only fatalities. Another tornado struck the city of Joliet, Illinois, causing US$5 million in damage to the historic district in town. =April 21 (China)= Seven people were killed by a tornado in China. May 509 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =May 9 (China)= Two people were killed by a tornado in China. =May 12= A massive, slow- moving, high-end F4 tornado passed near the town of Harper, Kansas. The rating, however, is a source of controversy. At peak intensity it deeply scoured the ground, completely swept away two homes, chipping the foundation of one home in the process, and debarked nearby trees. Vehicles were pulverized into small pieces and thrown very large distances. The reason for the F4 rating was that the tornado was very slow moving, which may have added to the extent of the damage. =May 22–30= The Hallam, Nebraska, tornado on May 22 was the widest tornado ever recorded at the time at in diameter. The F4 tornado caused one death and 37 injuries in the city of Hallam. Beginning on May 29, after the Storm Prediction Center issued a high risk for severe weather, 149 tornadoes were confirmed in 32 hours, killing five people. The Memorial Day Weekend outbreak is considered to be one of the most prolific in US history in terms of the number of tornadoes. June 268 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =June 1 (Russia)= One June 1, at least 11 tornadoes touched down in Russia, including a high-end F3 that damaged or destroyed 342 homes. =June 9 (Europe)= Several tornadoes touched down across northern Germany, the Czech Republic, and Hungary on June 9. At 14:30 UTC, an F3 tornado struck Litovel, injuring five people. A T4/F2 tornado injured one person in Lower Saxony, and another F2 tornado struck Budapest. =June 11–12= A small tornado outbreak began across the Midwestern United States on June 11, mainly in Iowa and Wisconsin. Most of the tornadoes that occurred this day were weak, being rated F0 or F1. However, a few strong tornadoes did touch down, the most significant being an F3 tornado that caused deep ground scouring and destroyed a home near Le Roy, Minnesota. The next day would bring more tornadoes, this time to Kansas. The first tornado was reported near Belle Plaine, which was rated F0. After the first tornado lifted, the same supercell produced another tornado, which would go on to impact structures near Mulvane. This tornado directly hit a house and completely removed it from its foundation. After the Mulvane tornado dissipated, another photogenic tornado touched down near Rock and was rated F0. This supercell would go on to produce several more tornadoes, all of which were rated F0. Overall, 46 tornadoes touched down during this outbreak. =June 18 (Russia)= On June 18, another F3 tornado touched down in Russia, injuring seven people. =June 23 (Germany)= A severe F3 tornado hit the Saxony-Anhaltian villages of Micheln and Trebbichau. Both villages have suffered from damages. July 124 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S.http://www.tornadohistoryproject.com/tornado/2004/7/table =July 7–9 (Europe)= In Poland, a tornado touched down in Wiktorów and Borzęcin near Warsaw. 21 houses were damaged. One 36-old man was lifted by tornado. An F2 tornado struck Jelonka and Kleszczele near Dubicze Cerkiewne, Podlaskie Voivodeship. 200 buildings were damaged. Skywarn Polska =July 13–15= On July 13, a large, violent F4 tornado struck Roanoke, Illinois, destroying the Pearson Manufacturing Plant and some civilian residences. Despite the extensive damage along its 9.6 mile path of destruction, well advance warning of the storm's approach led to only a few minor injuries and no fatalities. Three other F0 tornadoes were confirmed on this day as well. On July 14, a large storm system passed over the Northeastern United States. It produced several severe storms, and a few tornadoes. The worst destruction was in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, where 272 properties were damaged or destroyed by an F3 twister that struck the town around 3:00 PM. =July 18= On July 18, a small tornado outbreak struck North Dakota, The most powerful of which being a high end F4 that struck the town of Marion. Though were no fatalities or injuries, This tornado is considered to be one of the strongest tornadoes of the 2000s. August 179 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =August 11 (France)= On August 11, a waterspout moved onshore in Houat, France, damaging the harbor and village. One person was killed after being lifted by the tornado and falling on rocks while twelve others were injured. =August 12= Damage from a tornado on August 12 in Harnett County, North Carolina The second storm of the 2004 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Tropical Storm Bonnie caused minor damage while spawning several tornadoes when it made landfall several hours before Hurricane Charley. =August 13–14= Charley Landfall Hurricane Charley caused major damage along the Florida coast and the Mid- Atlantic while spawning several tornadoes including an F2 storm. September 297 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =September 4–8= Hurricane Frances produced the third highest number of tornadoes spawned by a single tropical cyclone. At the time of the outbreak, it was the second highest but was surpassed by Hurricane Ivan later that month. =September 15–18= Hurricane Ivan produced the highest number of tornadoes from a single tropical cyclone on record. During the storm's 3.5 day outbreak, 120 tornadoes touched down over eight states. The outbreak killed nine people, six of which were in Florida and four were from a single tornado. =September 25–28= Hurricane Jeanne was the final hurricane to strike the U.S. during the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. It spawned several tornadoes upon and after its landfall, which caused some damage, but no deaths. October 79 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =October 18–19= November 150 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =November 12–13 (Italy and Tunisia)= Several powerful tornadoes struck southern Sicily and northern Tunisia on November 12 and 13. The strongest was a high-end F3 multiple-vortex tornado that touched down near Scicli on November 12 which inflicted roughly €25 million (US$32.4 million) in damage. Another tornado, rated F2, began just offshore Donnalucata before moving inland. The following day, a long-tracked F2 tornado struck several towns in northern Tunisia, most notably Kelibia, El Haouaria, and Hammamet, killing 9–12 people and injuring 60–73 others.Coppola, p. 467 Three homes were completely destroyed by the tornado while many others sustained varying degrees of damage. Significant agricultural damage as well as loss of livestock also resulted from the storm. A third F2 touched down near Rakkada and injured 21 people. In light of the damage in Tunisia, the Tunisian Red Crescent society assisted approximately 200 affected persons with recovery funds and supplies. =November 22–24= In late November, a significant three-day outbreak of tornadoes took place across the Southern United States. The outbreak began on the 22nd, producing six F0 tornadoes in Louisiana and Texas, three of which occurred in the Houston area. The tornadoes caused minimal damage and no injuries. Tornado activity continued in the same general area on the 23rd. Early on, most of the touchdowns were weak, though an F2 tornado near Kountze, Texas damaged between 10 and 20 houses and killed a woman when trees crushed her mobile home. Several other tornadoes occurred in Texas throughout the afternoon, and soon began touch down in Louisiana as well. An F2 struck the town of Hutton, damaging about 15 houses and injuring three people. Further north, an F3 touched down and ripped directly through the town of Olla, where major damage occurred. A high school in town sustained significant damage, along with 106 homes. Some of the homes only had interior rooms left. A pickup truck outside of town was thrown 200 feet, and in the nearby town of Standard, four homes and a store were destroyed. Overall, the tornado killed one person and injured 20 others. Another F3 touched down near Fayette, Mississippi, destroying a steel-frame shed, damaging several homes, and flattening large swaths of trees. Vigorous tornado activity continued on the 24th, mainly across Mississippi and Alabama. However, an F2 tornado tore through the northwest side of Slidell, Louisiana, damaging 152 homes in a single subdivision and injuring four people. Numerous tornadoes touched down in Mississippi, with the strongest being an F3 that passed near Noxapater. The tornado downed hundreds of trees, tossed vehicles, and destroyed chicken houses. A house was completely destroyed, resulting in a fatality and two injuries. In Alabama, a large F2 tracked across Autauga, Chilton, and Coosa Counties. The tornado struck the Cooper community, resulting in major structural damage. Another F2 touched down and struck the Talladega Superspeedway, where two concession stands within the infield area of the race track had their roofs blown off. The Bush Garage area received building damage and the garage doors were bowed out. Debris was scattered between the garage area and Victory Lane. One digital leader board was completely destroyed and another one sustained major damage. The tornado continued east through Eastaboga, where two homes suffered major roof damage, two porches were destroyed and many trees were blown down. The tornado then struck Bynum where downed trees heavily damaged two mobile homes, with a 75-year-old woman being killed in one of them. The tornado then caused roof and structural damage in Southern Anniston before dissipating. Overall, the outbreak produced 104 tornadoes and killed four people. December 26 tornadoes were confirmed in the U.S. =December 6–7= A small tornado outbreak took place in the Deep South on the evening of December 6 and early on the 7th. =December 22 = This was the last tornado outbreak of 2004, with 16 tornadoes reported. =December 29 = 3 tornadoes were reported in California.

It has a population of 1,916 (02.06.2009). Cieszanów is located on the boundary of southern Roztocze, in the valley of the Brusienka river. In the Middle Ages, sandy shores of the river attracted Slavic settlers, who probably in the 10th century established a gord here. In 1921 there were 929 Jews in Cieszanów. During World War II and the Holocaust, all but a handful died of starvation and disease in Cieszanów or were murdered in the Belzec killing camp.  History  The history of a town named Cieszanów is rather short and dates back to the late 15th century, as it was first mentioned in documents in 1496. At that time, it was part of Lubaczów County, Bełz Voivodeship. In 1580, the city of Zamość was founded, which attracted an influx of settlers. Furthermore, a merchant road to Jarosław was established nearby, so a nobleman Stanisław Cieszanowski (Jelita coat of arms), who was owner of the village, applied for town charter. On May 14, 1590 in Warsaw, King Sigismund III of Poland granted Magdeburg rights to the new town, which was named Cieszanów, after the Cieszanowski family. Following the death of Stanisław Cieszanowski, the town belonged to several families. In 1646, its castle was attacked by Cossacks, during the Khmelnytsky uprising. In 1656, the town was burned by Swedes (see Swedish invasion of Poland), and in 1672 by Crimean Tatars. In 1681, King John III Sobieski, who had fought the Tatars in this area in the Polish–Ottoman War (1672–76), confirmed Cieszanów's town charter. From the first partition of Poland in 1772 until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district with the same name, one of the 78 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Austrian Galicia province (Crown land).Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 A brickyard was opened here, and in 1800, a brick church was built. The town remained private property of the Rojowski family, whose coat of arms is now used as the coat of arms of Cieszanów. In 1857, the population consisted of 859 Roman Catholics, 250 Greek Catholics and 1057 Jews. Since poverty was rampant, a number of residents decided to leave Galicia and settle in Northern America. In 1867 Cieszanów was named seat of a newly created county, which included six towns (Lubaczów, Cieszanów, Lipsko, Narol, Oleszyce and Płazów. County court, post and tax offices, and offices of the local governments were moved here from other towns. Due to proximity of the border with Russian-controlled Congress Poland, Cieszanów and its vicinity was used for smuggling of weapons, ammunition and volunteers during the January Uprising (1863–1864). In May 1863, a large military hospital for Polish rebels was established here, and Austrian government, uneasy about the situation, sent to Cieszanów a squadron of Hungarian mounted troops, which guarded the borderline. In 1883, the monument of King John III Sobieski was unveiled, in 1871, a post of the Polish Pedagogical Society was established, followed by Volunteer Firefighters, Charity Society, Gymnastic Society Sokol, Polish Boyscouts, and other organizations. The development of Cieszanow was stopped by World War I. On November 11, 1914, the town was captured by the Russians, who remained here until June 18, 1915. During heavy fighting, the town was burned, and county government was temporarily moved to Lubaczow (until 1919). On November 1, 1918, Ukrainian military units seized control over Cieszanów, but they were expelled by Polish soldiers on December 6, 1918. In the Second Polish Republic, Cieszanów belonged to Lwów Voivodeship, losing in 1923 its status as the seat of a county. Cieszanów was rebuilt, becoming local center of trade and commerce. In 1921, its population was 2282. On September 7, 1939, Cieszanów was bombed by the Luftwaffe, and five days later, first Wehrmacht units entered the town, arresting members of local government. The Germans soon retreated (see Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact), replaced by the Red Army, but in early October 1939, Cieszanów became part of General Government’ Zamość County. The town had a garrison of German border guard (Grenzschutz). In 1942, almost all of the Jewish population of Cieszanów were murdered, mostly in Belzec. On May 4, 1944, Cieszanów was destroyed by the UPA unit commanded by and aided by local militia. During the attack several inhabitants were killed and the rest evacuated by the Home Army. On July 21, first Soviet troops entered the empty town. Residents returned, a post office was established (September 15, 1944), and on September 18, classes at the local elementary school started. In 1957, Cieszanów had a population of 1352, but two years later, its population shrank to 1267. Until 1975, the town belonged to Rzeszów Voivodeship, and from 1975 until 1999, it was part of Przemyśl Voivodeship.

Text's origin and content  The text was found among those included in The Nag Hammadi Library, in CG II, in 1945. It is tentatively dated in the third century CE and is thought to originate from a transitional period in Gnosticism when it was converting from a purely mythological state into a philosophical phase. The beginning and conclusion to the document are Christian Gnostic, but the rest of the material is a mythological narrative regarding the origin and nature of the archontic powers peopling the heavens between Earth and the Ogdoad, and how the destiny of man is affected by these primeval happenings.Bullard in Robinson 162; Bullard 3 The work is presented as a learned treatise in which a teacher addresses a topic suggested by the dedicatee of the work. The treatise begins with a fragment of cosmogony, which leads to a revisionistic \\"true history\\" of the events in the Genesis creation story, reflecting Gnostic distrust of the material world and the demiurge that created it. Within this narrative there is an \\"angelic revelation dialogue\\" where an angel repeats and elaborates the author's fragment of cosmogonic myth in much broader scope, concluding with historical prediction of the coming of the savior and the end of days.Layton (1995) 65 Although the etymologies and puns on Semitic names suggest the author's close contact with Jewish legends and interpretive traditions as well as knowledge of Greek mythology and Hellenistic cult practices, the myth is, according to Bentley Layton purposefully anti-Judaic.Layton (1995) 65 In addition, arguably, the work contains no Christian anti-Gnostic characteristics.Layton (1995) 65 The text, like all the texts in the Nag Hammadi Library, is believed to have originally been written in Greek.Layton (1974) 362 As the original Greek text has not been discovered, the only known version is the Coptic translation from Nag Hammadi.Layton (1995) 67 Characters * The Parent of the Entirety: The invisible virgin spirit. * Incorruptibility * The Child: Presides over the entirety. * The Four Luminaries: Eleleth and three others. * The True Human Being * The Undominated Race * Wisdom: Sophia or Pistis Sophia. * Zoe (Life): daughter of Sophia. * Yaldabaoth: The chief ruler also called Sakla and Samael. * Sabaoth: One of Yaldabaoth's first seven offspring. * Adam: The first human being. * Eve: Adam's wife and counterpart. * Cain: Eve's son begotten by the rulers. * Abel: Eve's son begotten by Adam. * Seth: a son through god. * Norea: Eve's daughter.Layton (1995) 66.

That house became the residence of Sigismund Báthory, general Giorgio Basta, Stephen Bocskay, Gabriel Báthory and Gabriel Bethlen. In 1621 Gabriel Bethlen began the radical transformation of the initial house, with the result being the Magna Curia palace. The Bethlen Castle was a Renaissance style building, but the subsequent modifications (until the first half of the 18th century) that gave it the final shape that can be seen today, added Baroque style architecture.

History Goldfield Stores, circa 1932 The town was named after a pastoral run, which was in turn named by pastoralist John Ross, in 1851, for the Polish city of Kraków, which had recently been the centre for a fight for Polish national independence. Gold was first discovered in Cracow in 1875 by itinerant fossickers and a further discovery of a nugget was made by an Aboriginal man in 1916. In 1931, the Golden Plateau mine was established and it operated continuously until 1976. Cracow Post Office opened on 1 October 1932. At its gold mining peak, the town included five cafes, barber shop, billiard saloon, two butchers, a picture theatre and a soft drink factory. The closure of the mine led to Cracow becoming a ghost town with many deserted houses and shops. In 2004, Newcrest Mining reestablished gold mining in the town, leading to hopes the town may recover. thumb At the 2011 census, Cracow and the surrounding area had a population of 196.

History Kańczuga was first mentioned in documents from 1340, when it was part of Red Ruthenia. At that time, the village belonged to the noble Pilecki family. In the second half of the 14th century, Elżbieta Pilecka, the daughter of Kańczuga's founder Otton of Pilcza, married a nobleman from Greater Poland, Wincenty Granowski, and after his death, she married King Wladyslaw Jagiello. In 1440, Kańczuga received town charter. It still remained in the hands of the Pilecki family, but in the subsequent centuries, Kańczuga was property of such families, as Odrowaz, Kostka, Ostrogski, Lubomirski and Sanguszko. The town, with its deep tunnels used as merchant goods storages, prospered until the late 15th century, when its population reached 3000. In 1498, Kańczuga was burned to the ground in a Wallachian raid, which ended the period of prosperity. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, the area of Kańczuga was frequently raided by the Crimean Tatars. In a 1624 raid, all local villages were burned, and thousands of residents kidnapped.

Considered by John Bird, the author of Grainger's biography, to be his masterpiece, the work has six movements, each adapted from folk songs that Grainger had collected on a 1905-1906 trip to Lincolnshire, England. In a similar fashion to these folk songs, many of the movements are in strophic form. The work debuted with three movements on March 7, 1937 performed by the Milwaukee Symphonic Band, a group composed of members from bands including the Blatz Brewery and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer factory worker bands in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Unlike other composers who attempted to alter and modernize folk music, such as Ralph Vaughan Williams, Grainger wished to maintain the exact stylizing that he experienced from the originals. In the piece's program notes, Grainger wrote: \\"...Each number is intended to be a kind of musical portrait of the singer who sang its underlying melody—a musical portrait of the singer’s personality no less than of his habits of song—his regular or irregular interpretation of the rhythm, his preference for gaunt or ornately arabesqued delivery, his contrasts of legato and staccato, his tendency towards breadth or delicacy of tone.\\" Grainger dedicated his \\"bunch of Wildflowers\\" to \\"the old folksingers who sang so sweetly to me\\". Instrumentation The suite is scored for the following band:Full score edition by Frederick Fennell, Ludwig Music Publishing Co., Inc., 1987. ;Woodwinds: :Piccolo :2 Flutes :2 Oboes :Cor anglais :2 Bassoons :Contrabassoon :Clarinet in E : 3 Clarinets in B :Alto clarinet in E :Bass clarinet in B :Soprano saxophone :2 Alto saxophones :Tenor saxophone :Baritone saxophone :Bass saxophone ;Brass : : 3 Trumpets : 4 Horns in F : 2 Tenor trombones :Bass trombone :Baritone :Euphonium :Tuba ;Strings : :String bass ;Percussion : :Timpani :Xylophone :Glockenspiel :Handbells :Tubular bells :Snare drum :Bass drum :Cymbals Movements =I. \\"Lisbon\\"= Originally entitled \\"Dublin Bay\\", the first movement is the shortest--a simple, lilting melody in time. The melody follows a young sailor preparing to leave his love to head towards Lisbon. In the opening of the movement, the main theme is stated by the 1st and 2nd trumpets (with mutes), 1st horns, and bassoon. As is typical with any piece of music in strophic form such as this, the theme is repeated throughout by the other sections of the ensemble. Later in the movement, the 1st horns and trumpets quote another Grainger work, entitled \\"The Duke of Marlborough Fanfare\\" as the rest of the ensemble continues with a repetition of the theme. The final repetition augments the theme and ends with a 2-3 retardation. \\\\version \\"2.18.2\\" ew Staff { \\\\key des \\\\major \\\\time 6/8 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"trumpet\\" \\\\tempo Brisk 4. = 116 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t  r4. r4 <>  <> <> <> <>  <> <> <>  <> <> <> <>  <> <> <>  <> <> <> <>  <> <> <>  <> <> <> <>  <> <> r8 } =II. \\"Horkstow Grange\\"= Also in strophic form, the theme is stated by the clarinets at the opening of the movement.

In an alternate version that Grainger wrote, the melody originates in the piccolo and alto clarinet and is echoed by the oboe and bassoon in a similar fashion. This movement is considered quite difficult to count due to the counterpoint, unusual rhythms, and rapidly shifting time signatures. As mentioned, Grainger wrote two versions; one with a flugelhorn solo and one with a soprano saxophone solo. It is noted that Grainger preferred the latter, but only if the soloist was able to perform the solo with much expression and musicality. Therefore, most ensembles who record the work in its entirety choose this version in order to stay true to the composer’s wishes. The ensemble Grainger had chosen to premiere the piece, the Milwaukee Symphonic Band, was unable to play this movement, which led to its being omitted from the premiere performance, along with the fifth movement. \\\\version \\"2.18.2\\" ew Staff { \\\\key c \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Flowingly\\" 4 = 132 \\\\time 4/8 c2( ~ \\\\pp \\\\< \\\\time 5/8 c4. ~ c16 des16] \\\\mf \\\\> c16[ bes'16 aes'8 \\\\p \\\\< bes'8 c4) c8( \\\\> bes'8 g'8 ees'4 \\\\< f'8 \\\\time 4/8 g'16[ c8.] \\\\> f'8.[ ees'16] \\\\time 5/8 f'4.) r8 \\\\\\\\! g'8( \\\\p \\\\< \\\\break aes'8 bes'8 c4 d16 ees16 f8 \\\\f \\\\> d8 bes'4 a'8 \\\\time 4/8 bes'8 c8 d16 f8. c4) \\\\p r8 f'16( \\\\< g'16 \\\\time 5/8 aes'8 bes'8 c4) c8( f8 \\\\f \\\\> d8 bes'4 a'8 \\\\< \\\\break \\\\time 4/8 bes'8 c8 d8 \\\\acciaccatura d8 f8 \\\\> \\\\time 5/8 c4.) r8 f'8( \\\\p \\\\< aes'8 bes'8 c4) \\\\> c8( bes'8 \\\\prall g'16 f'16 ees'4 \\\\< f'8 \\\\time 3/4 g'16 c8. \\\\> f'8. ees'16 f'4 ~ \\\\p f'8) } =IV. \\"The Brisk Young Sailor\\"= A simple, short, jaunty tune in the key of B major meant to evoke the image of a strapping young lad striding up the road to meet his sweetheart. The movement, also in strophic form, opens with the clarinet section stating the theme. The theme is then elaborated upon by the entire ensemble with several variations. A notable part of this movement is a baritone horn solo, which is accompanied by the first clarinets, E clarinet, flutes, and piccolo with virtuosic sextuplet patterns and arpeggios. This accompaniment is a technical challenge regarded by many as the reason for this movement is among the most difficult of the six movements to perform. \\\\version \\"2.18.2\\" ew Staff { \\\\key bes \\\\major \\\\time 3/4 \\\\clef treble \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"clarinet\\" \\\\tempo Sprightly 4 = 92 \\\\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t  r4 r8 f'8(\\\\mp bes'8) bes'16( d16-.)  bes'4( a'8-.) bes'-. g'8 ees'  f'8.( d'16 bes8) bes'16 a' g'8 f'  ees'8.( d'16) c'8.( bes16) d'8-- ees'--  f'4.-- f'8-. bes'8-. bes'-.  ees4->( c8) c <> <>  <> <> <> <> <> <>  <> <> <> <> <> <>  <> r8 r4 } =V. \\"Lord Melbourne\\"= A fierce war song originally entitled \\"Lord Marlborough,\\" the title refers to John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough. It opens in free time, in which the conductor gives gestures for every beat. The piece then moves into a trumpet solo followed by a repetition of the opening, also in free time. This movement shifts into different time signatures in short succession, including asymmetrical ones such as and , as well as having more intermittent sections of free time.

As the tempo is too fast for the conductor to gesture each beat of every measure, the movement is typically conducted \\"in 1\\" where each gesture given by the conductor indicates a full measure instead of each beat. Also in strophic form, almost every section of the ensemble states the theme at some point in the movement. This movement is based on the ballad of the same name, in which a lady, who while living with her uncle in a village is kidnapped by three gypsies. After being missing for a long time, the villagers begin to speculate that the uncle is responsible for her disappearance, later imprisoning him and condemning him to death. At some point, the lady was found in Dublin by a young squire who loved her and was subsequently brought back to the village. Upon return to the village, the villagers, mere moments away from executing the uncle at the gallows, realized their error and set the uncle free, celebrating the lady's return with church bells (which are emulated by the tubular bells in the closing of the movement), music, and frivolity. As this movement was not yet completed at the time of the work's premiere, it was omitted for the performance. \\\\version \\"2.18.2\\" ew Staff { \\\\relative g' { \\\\set Staff.midiInstrument = #\\"oboe\\" \\\\tempo \\"Fast, but sturdily\\" 2. = 66 \\\\time 3/4 r4 r4 e \\\\f d-> d e c-> c d a'-> a8[ g] e8[ f] d4.-> r8 e4 d-> d e c-> c d a'-> c8[ b] a8[ g] a4.-> r8 g4 a a d \\\\sf a a b \\\\sf g8[ g] g4 e \\\\sf d4. r8 e4 d-> d e c-> c d a'-> a8[ g] e8[ f] d4.-> } } References =Citations= =Bibliography=  * External links *A Source Guide to the Music of Percy Grainger by Thomas P.

Chemesthetic sensations arise when chemical compounds activate receptors associated with other senses that mediate pain, touch, and thermal perception. These chemical-induced reactions do not fit into the traditional sense categories of taste and smell. Examples of chemesthetic sensations include the burn-like irritation from capsaicin and related compounds in foods like chili peppers; the coolness of menthol in mouthwashes and topical analgesic creams; the stinging or tingling of carbonated beverages in the nose and mouth; the tear-induction of cut onions; and the pungent, cough-inducing sensation in the back of the throat elicited by the oleocanthal in high-quality extra virgin olive oil. Some of these sensations may be referred to as spiciness, pungency, or piquancy. Chemesthetic sensations sometimes arise by direct chemical activation of ion channels on sensory nerve fibers, for example of transient receptor potential channels including those of the TRPV, TRPA or TRPM subtypes. Alternatively, irritant chemicals may activate cells of the epithelium to release substances that indirectly activate the nerve fibers. The respiratory passages, including the nose and trachea, possess specialized cells called solitary chemosensory cells which release acetylcholine or other activators to excite nearby nerve fibers. Because chemoresponsive nerve fibers are present in all types of skin, chemesthetic sensations can be stimulated from anywhere on the body's surface as well as from mucosal surfaces in the nose, mouth, eyes, etc. Mucus membranes are generally more sensitive to chemesthetic stimuli because they lack the barrier function of cornified skin. Much of the chemesthetic flavor sensations are mediated by the trigeminal nerves, which are relatively large and important nerves. Flavors that stimulate the trigeminal nerves are therefore important - for example, carbon dioxide is the trigeminal stimulant in carbonated beverages.

It was shot at Shepperton Studios near London with sets designed by the art director Herbert Smith. Location shooting took place in Almería in southern Spain, particularly in the Tabernas Desert which was frequently used in European westerns during the decade. The cast also includes Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, and Honor Blackman, Connery's co-star in Goldfinger. It is based on a 1962 novel of the same title by Louis L'Amour. It was the first in a trilogy of L'Amour adaptions from Euan Lloyd.  Plot summary  In 1880 in New Mexico, frontier adventurer Bosky Fulton (Stephen Boyd) and his men lead a hunting party of European aristocrats and their servants, along with a retired American politician and his wife, into Apache territory. When a French countess, Irina Lazaar (Brigitte Bardot), wanders off, she is attacked by Apache warriors on horseback. She is rescued by Shalako (Sean Connery), a former U.S. Cavalry officer with a personal interest in keeping non-Indians off Indian land. While on the way to returning her to the hunting party, they are surrounded by Apaches. They both promise the Apache chief they will get the outsiders off the land. The chief agrees, but his son, Chato (Woody Strode), tells Shalako he intends to kill him in battle. Shalako urges the leader of the hunting party, Frederick von Hallstatt (Peter van Eyck), to leave, but he refuses and the two men soon despise each other. Shalako rides off to get the army to escort the party off Apache land, but the Apaches attack and would overrun the party but for a smoke signal ruse of Shalako from some distance away. The devious Fulton takes advantage of the lull in the fighting; he and his men take the hunting party's main stage coach, plus all the weapons and supplies, leaving the hunting party at the mercy of the Apaches. Lady Julia Daggett (Honor Blackman), seeing the hopeless situation of the party, decides to leave her husband, the pathetic Sir Charles Daggett (Jack Hawkins), and go along as Fulton's lover. She and Fulton had previously teased each other in a sexually fraught manner. Shalako returns to the stranded hunting party, which is re-equipped with weapons and supplies he had previously advised them to hide in reserve. He hopes to lead them on foot to a plateau where they will be temporarily safe. Shalako and von Hallstadt continue to feud, but over time their feelings evolve to mutual respect. The Apaches attack the stage coach, killing all Fulton's men as well as Lady Julia. Fulton, having watched her killing, joins up with the hunting party. After they rebuff an initial Apache attack, the humiliated Sir Charles challenges Fulton, and they fatally shoot each other. Chato and some other Apache warriors come up behind the Europeans, catching them by surprise. Chato challenges Shalako to a one-on-one fight with spears. Chato loses and is about to be killed when his father, the Apache chief, intervenes. He gives safe passage to Shalako and the others in return for his son's life. Chato storms off, feeling disgraced. With the surviving members of the party safe, Shalako rides off into the western landscape, accompanied by Countess Irina.

Over the years as Lloyd dreamed of becoming an independent producer, he kept in touch with L'Amour. He wanted to film his 1962 novel Shalako. At one time Lloyd had lined up Henry Fonda and Senta Berger to star in the film, planning to shoot it in Mexico. Lloyd recounted that, at the time, many film distributors were reluctant to back a film starring Fonda, and increases in the cost of filming in Mexico made it impossible to pursue.\\"Euan Lloyd Interview\\", Cinema Retro No. 1 During a meeting with L'Amour, Lloyd recounted long lines at the cinemas in New York City for the latest James Bond adventure film. L'Amour remarked that Sean Connery, who starred in the role, would certainly \\"look tall in the saddle\\".\\"Lloyd interview When Lloyd met Sean Connery and discussed the work with him, he learned that Connery was a Western fan since childhood. He was also keen to do the film as he had been promised $1.2 million and 30% of the profits out of the $5 million budget.Herzberg, Bob. From Shooting Scripts: From Pulp Western to Film, 2005, McFarland, p.123 Connery was available, as he had turned down playing Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Lloyd obtained that film's planned original co-star Brigitte Bardot, Bond cinematographer Ted Moore, and Bond stuntman and action scene arranger Bob Simmons. Bardot was paid $400,000 plus 12.5% of the profits. Once Lloyd had Connery on board, many European and other film distributors were keen to finance the film. Distributors in 35 different countries agreed to provide promissory notes worth $5 million payable on delivery of the film. This enabled Lloyd to raise the $3 million necessary to start production and to sign Connery and Bardot. $1,455,000 came from ABC in the US, with $2 million from elsewhere. Dimitri de Grunwald became involved in helping finance. =Shooting= The film was shot in Almería, Spain. Whilst scouting locations when planning to film in the United States, Lloyd had noticed that many Native Americans were overweight. He did not think they looked menacing enough. Simmons recruited a \\"war party\\" of lean and mean Romani people (gypsies), whom he trained to ride and act like war-bent Apaches.Simmons, Bob & Passingham, Kenneth. Nobody Does It Better: My 25 Years of Stunts With James Bond and Other Stories, 1987, Blandford Simmons talked Connery into shaving off the droopy moustache which he had grown for the historic period. The investors perhaps remembered Gregory Peck's moustache in The Gunfighter, which was believed to have discouraged some of the public from attending. They feared the same might happen with Shalako. Almería province was a favoured location for filming spaghetti Westerns. But, when Shalako was in production, Harry Saltzman's Second World War film, Play Dirty, set in North Africa, was being filmed on the same locations. One film crew had to wipe out the tyre tracks in the sand before filming the Old West, whilst the other had to pick up the horse droppings before shooting the Second World War battles. Once the gypsy Apaches, mounted on horseback, rode by mistake headlong into an attack on a Long Range Desert Group. Lloyd gathered a strong international cast, including Connery's former co-star Honor Blackman from Goldfinger, as well as Jack Hawkins, Stephen Boyd, Woody Strode, Peter van Eyck, Alexander Knox, Eric Sykes, and Don Barry. At this stage in his career Hawkins had lost his once- booming voice to throat cancer, his voice was dubbed in by others. Connery and Bardot got on well during filming and both enjoyed the experience of making the film.https://www.pinterest.com/amp/pin/137430226105889042/  Critical response  The film premiered in late 1968 to mixed reviews. Some critics thought the film was not as good as the other Westerns being made in Europe, in particular, the Italian westerns (known as \\"spaghetti Westerns\\") by which Sergio Leone, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood were building their reputations. =Censorship= Two scenes are routinely cut when the film is shown on television: \\\\- the death of the cowboy sent to protect Bardot's character; \\\\- the rape and death of Honor Blackman's character. =Box office= Shalako was the 18th most popular film of 1969.\\"The World's Top Twenty Films.\\" Sunday Times [London, England] 27 Sept. 1970: 27. The Sunday Times Digital Archive. accessed 5 Apr. 2014 It recorded admissions of 1,385,466 in France.Box office information for film at Box Office Story However, according to Variety, because of its high costs the film recorded a loss for ABC of $1,275,000. Later, Shalako became a cult classic; it has been regarded as having the hallmarks of a European Western. Critics noted this was Sean Connery's first attempt to go mainstream in film and to distance himself from the James Bond role. Connery continued to experiment with other roles, although he starred in two more Bond films, Diamonds Are Forever and Never Say Never Again. Home video Shalako has been released in many territories on VHS and DVD, and in 2017 received its first and only official Blu-ray release to date, from Kino Lorber in the US.

It is the only high school in the Laguna Beach Unified School District. It was established in 1934 and is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges. History Prior to 1323, no high school existed in Orange county, this gooch. That year Santa Ana started adding post- eighth grade courses to their regular instructional program. By 1892, the Santa Ana High School was formally accredited by the University of California as the county's first high school. Fullerton was established in 1893, Anaheim in 1898. Still, high school education was not required in California until state legislation in 1919 that mandated that all elementary school districts affiliate with a high school district by September, 1921. Rather than join Santa Ana, the Laguna School District joined with four other elementary school districts to form the Tustin Union High School District. This new high school was located on the site of the current Tustin High School more than 20 miles from Laguna Beach. Laguna Beach finally established a separate high school district in 1933 and on Tuesday, September 11, 1934, Laguna Beach High School opened with a gooch enrollment of 157 students in a new wing constructed as part of the existing Laguna Elementary School facility [1928]. In 1935, the K-5 portion of the school was relocated to a new school built across Park Avenue. North Gym opened in 1935, the 1st floor of the high school Library building opened in 1954 and the 2nd floor Science rooms were added in 1960. Dugger Gym and Guyer Field were added in 1962 and Administration was constructed in 1964 on the site of the old 1908 2-room schoolhouse. Major renovations occurred in 1993 with new classrooms, pool and a facelift. Another major remodel and expansion occurred in 2003–05. Student demographics As if the 2018–19 school year, the ethnic makeup of the school is 76.9% White, 11.0% Hispanic, 1.3% African-American, 0.6% Filipino, 5.0% Asian, 0.3% Pacific Islander, 0.2% American Indian/Alaskan Native and 4.8% multiple/no response.

It was also recognized as a California Distinguished School in 2007 and 2012, placing the school among the top 5% of the state. Athletics Laguna teams were originally called the Breakers but the community already had a reputation as an art colony even before the establishing of the Festival of Arts 1932 and the famous Pageant of the Masters 1935. Civic pride with Laguna's art community culminated in a student body vote on June 4, 1936, to change the nickname to \\"Artists\\" after only 19 months as the Breakers. In 2003, the student body voted to return to the \\"Breakers\\" nickname. Girls' Sports were initially under the Girls' Athletic Association with limited interscholastic competition.

Documents from the eighth century attest to his episcopate. Walafrid Strabo, in response to the construction of a church in honor of the saint, indicates that Marcian was the first bishop of the Tortonese community and a martyr.

MOLAA is the only museum in the United States dedicated to modern and contemporary Latin American and Latino art. History The Museum of Latin American Art (MOLAA) is located in downtown Long Beach, California. Housed in a contemporary structure designed by Mexican architect Manuel Rosen, the museum is home to four galleries, a contemporary “project space” and an outdoor sculpture garden. Founded in 1996 by Dr. Robert Gumbiner, MOLAA is the only museum in the United States dedicated to modern and contemporary Latin American art. Through ground-breaking exhibitions, educational programs and cultural events, MOLAA expands the knowledge and appreciation of modern and contemporary Latin American art and culture and promotes a cross-cultural dialogue. Site and building MOLAA is located in Long Beach's developing East Village Arts District. Between 1913 and 1918 the site that the Museum now occupies was the home of the Balboa Amusement Producing Company, then the world's most productive and innovative silent film studio. Before there was a Hollywood, Balboa was the king of the silver screen, producing nearly 20,000 feet of film a week. The building that was renovated in 1998 as MOLAA's Entertainment / Education / Special Event venue may have been part of the old Balboa film studio. MOLAA's exhibition galleries, administrative offices and store are housed in what was once a roller skating rink known as the Hippodrome. Built in the late 1920s, after the film studios were gone, the Hippodrome was a haven for skaters for four decades. The high vaulted ceilings and beautiful wooden floors were perfectly suited for the Hippodrome's final metamorphosis into the Museum of Latin American Art. Expansion and renovation After completing a $10 million expansion and renovation, MOLAA unveiled its newly expanded campus in June, 2007. The renovation and expansion included a 15,000 square foot sculpture garden, an education / art studio, a film-screening room, new administrative offices, a research library, a new entrance lobby and museum store. The expansion more than doubled the Museum's physical capacity to 55,000 square feet enabling MOLAA to serve many more visitors and broaden the range of exhibitions and programs offered to the community. Sculpture Garden MOLAA's Sculpture Garden continued the same theme of large wall elements, interlocking platonic solids, decorative wall niches and the use of strong vibrant accent colors found in many Latin American courtyard designs. Different raised and lowered platforms break up the 15,000 sq. ft. space into smaller intimate areas. The main focal point is the raised platform on the north side of the garden that is used for a variety of purposes, as well as an entertainment venue. In keeping with the Latin design tradition, the garden also features a water element – two low profile bubbling water fountains, the largest being located in the center of the garden. Collection MOLAA has a permanent collection, numbering over 1,500 works of painting, sculpture, drawing, mixed-media, photography and video art. MOLAA's collection also includes works from Latin American artists such as Dario Escobar, Pájaro (Juan Vicente Hernández), Daniel Lind-Ramos, Marco Maggi, Liliana Porter, Esterio Segura, Flavio Garciandia and many others. Smithsonian affiliation MOLAA is recognized as an Affiliate Museum of the Smithsonian Institution. This allows it to borrow works from the Smithsonian and use other resources as well. Traveling exhibitions Past exhibitions have highlighted works by modern masters such as Oswaldo Guayasamín, Wifredo Lam and David Alfaro Siqueiros as well as works by contemporary Latin American artists such as Regina Galindo, Roberto Fabelo and Marcos Ramirez Erre. Notable exhibitions Fabelo’s Anatomy June 28, 2014 - September 28, 2014. This exhibition at MOLAA is the first solo museum exhibition of Roberto Fabelo's work in the United States. In March 2014, MOLAA hosted Frida Kahlo, Her Photos exhibit. 55,000 people visited the exhibit and the membership increased by 60%. On June 2014, MOLAA's Board unanimously passed a resolution that clarified the definition of Latin American art to include Chicano art or art created by people of Latin American descent who have lived exclusively in the United States. The Museum can now officially open its doors to the entire Latino community – those living in their native countries, the U.S. or abroad and is already planning its first Biennial of Latin(o) American Art in 2016 in conjunction with MOLAA's 20th anniversary. Mission The Museum of Latin American Art expands knowledge and appreciation of modern and contemporary Latin American art and Latino art through its collection, ground-breaking exhibitions, stimulating educational programs, and engaging cultural events.

Opened in 1854, and completely rebuilt in 1900–1907, it is Europe's busiest international border station. As its name suggests, Basel SBB is owned by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). The other major railway station in Basel is Basel Badischer Bahnhof, which is on the north side of the Rhine from the city centre. Trains operated by SBB CFF FFS use Basel SBB to link Basel with destinations within Switzerland and Italy, as do Deutsche Bahn Intercity- Express (ICE) trains to and from Germany, Zürich and Interlaken, most SNCF TGV trains to and from Paris, and some regional trains to and from Alsace. Additionally, the station is served by three lines of the Basel S-Bahn. The 1907 neo-baroque station building is a heritage site of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 79. It also contains Bâle SNCF (shown in SBB CFF FFS online timetables as Basel SBB Gl. 30-35, and in other online timetables as Basel SNCF), which is located through a border crossing and is used by other trains to and from France. Directly outside the station building is the Centralbahnplatz, which is a major hub of the Basel tramway network, and the Basel terminus of a direct bus service to the EuroAirport. Location The station area is situated at the southern side of the city centre, in an elongated area between the Zoological Garden to the west and the to the east. The borders of four of Basel's districts come together at the station area. However, the area is, according to the Statistical Office, divided between only two districts: the station itself is located in , while most of the tracks on the eastern side of the station (including the goods station), along with the Centralbahnplatz in front of the station (including the BIS Tower), are attributed to the . The Elisabethenanlage in front of the Centralbahnplatz belongs to , while the opposite Basel SNCF is part of the district. History =Beginnings= alt=Basel's first railway station, 1847. The first railway to reach Basel, the Chemin de fer Strasbourg Bâle (StB) (Strasbourg Basel Railway), arrived there in 1844. The following year, 1845, the Elsässerbahn (Alsatian Railway) built the first station in the Basel metropolitan area, within the city walls. Basel thereby became the first Swiss city to be connected to the new means of transport. After the arrival of the railway, there was a passionate debate in Basel about the pros and cons of the railway and its possible continuation into the Swiss Plateau and the Gotthard. Meanwhile, the Rheintalbahn from Mannheim and Karlsruhe also approached Basel from the north; in 1851 it reached Haltingen (a district of Weil am Rhein), on the Swiss border. In 1853, the Schweizerische Centralbahn railway company (SCB) was founded in Basel. Its purpose was the establishment of a link between the city of Basel and the economic centres of the Mittelland cantons, and perhaps even also the expansion of the transport corridor from Lucerne to the Gotthard. The Viaduktstrasse in Basel – including the , which is adjacent to the Zoo Basel parking lot – was also the formation of the Elsässerbahn until 1902. Today, the viaduct serves tram lines 1 and 8, as well as motor vehicle traffic, and a plaque on the bridge railing recalls its earlier role as a rail bridge. = Provisional station = In 1854, construction began on the future Hauenstein railway line. Right up until the opening of the first section of the route from Basel to Liestal, the controversial question of the site and design of the Basel railway station remained unresolved. However, to accommodate the commencement of railway operations on 19 December 1854, the Centralbahn built a simple temporary timber structure, according to plans developed by chief architect Ludwig Maring. By the opening day, all of the temporary station buildings had been completed, including a timber train shed. This modest provisional station, equipped with makeshift facilities, was made up of individual detached buildings and was used only for just under six years. The station site consisted of the station building, a goods shed, a carriage and locomotive shed and a turntable at the railhead. As the station building stood on the northeastern side of the station, alongside the station yard, the station was not configured as a terminus. The provisional station served only as the starting point of the SCB lines, and had no connection with either the French station or the Badischer Bahnhof, which was opened in 1855 as the terminus of the Rheintalbahn. = Centralbahnhof = On 29 June 1857, the Grand Council of Basel-Stadt agreed to the construction of a link between the French line and the Centralbahn and the erection of a through station in the field in front of the Elisabethen-Bollwerk. The city bore the cost of the land purchase. At the start of 1859, the SCB began construction work on the site of the new station, to a design by Maring. In addition to a passenger station, the new station yard featured a goods station relocated to the Gundeldingen district, and two new locomotive sheds, one of them for the SCB, and the other for the Chemins de fer de l'Est, which had taken over the StB in 1854. On 4 June 1860, railway operations began at the new Basel Centralbahnhof. However, it was not until May 1861 that all the new facilities were completed. The Centralbahnhof was a joint station, with the northern facade of its station building facing the newly created Centralbahnplatz. On each side of the station building were the boarding halls, each with two tracks – on the eastern side for the Swiss trains and on the western side and for the French trains. To the south of the station building were the goods shed and two large warehouses, with an access road from the Güterstrasse. In subsequent years, modifications were made to the Centralbahnhof to enable it to deal with its substantially increasing traffic, including trains entering and leaving Basel along a number of new lines: * The connecting line between Basel Badischer Bahnhof and the Centralbahnhof, which was handed over to traffic on 3 November 1873. * The Bözberg Railway, which was opened on 2 August 1875; built by the Bötzbergbahn, a joint venture of the SCB and the Schweizerische Nordostbahn, it linked Basel with Zürich via Pratteln and Rheinfelden. * The Jura Railway, which, from 25 September 1875, formed a connection from Basel into western Switzerland and the Franche Comté, via its junction at Delémont and branches to Biel/Bienne and Delle, respectively. However, the Centralbahnhof eventually ran out of capacity to handle any further additional traffic. In 1875, as a first measure of relief, the marshalling of freight trains was relocated to a makeshift yard to the east of the station, on an open field known as \\"auf dem Wolf\\". At around that time, discussions began with the aim of lowering the tracks and replacing the troublesome urban level crossings on the Elsässerbahn and at the Centralbahnhof. In 1874, provisional timber pedestrian bridges had already been built at Margarethenstrasse und Heumattstrasse; they were later replaced by iron structures. From 1879, the Pfeffingerstrasse passed underneath the station in a tunnel near the present location of the Peter Merian Bridge. Finally, in 1898, following the referendum on the nationalisation of Switzerland's railways, the Swiss Federal Council decided to go ahead with the following: * construction of a new Centralbahnhof on the existing site; * lowering of the whole station area by ; * relocation of the Elsässerbahn to a cutting, in a wide arc around the city; * relocation of the entire freight and warehouse facility to the provisional marshalling yard at \\"auf den Wolf\\". =Provisional new Centralbahnhof= The definitive project for a new Centralbahnhof in Basel was developed in 1899. On 16 March 1900, the Federal Council gave approval to the plans. The lowering of the whole station area and the access lines required careful planning. The first step was the relocation of goods traffic to the Wolf station, and on 12 May 1901 the Alsace line was reopened in its new lower position and wide arc. On the vacated, lowered, area south of the original Centralbahnhof, the provisional station was built, and on 2 June 1902 it went into operation. Access to the provisional station was also from the south, via Güterstrasse. To facilitate access, various streets were extended, as were two tram lines. The provisional station remained in operation until 24 June 1907. The provisional facilities and access roads were then dismantled and the two tram lines laid into Güterstrasse. A station underpass to Gundeldingen was built roughly in the location of the provisional access road. In 1902-1903, the old station was torn down. = Basel SBB station= In 1902, the Schweizerische Centralbahn was absorbed by the newly formed Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). The new station, which from then onwards was referred to as Schweizer Bundesbahnhof or Basel SBB, was one of the new Federal Railways' first large building projects. Designed by Emil Faesch and Emmanuel La Roche, the new station was inaugurated on 24 June 1907. The Basel SBB station building is characterized by its extraordinary length: Basel SNCF, with its customs facility for the international transit traffic, is \\"attached\\" to its western side. The asymmetrical layout of the station creates an external appearance representative of the federal buildings of the time. The station building is aligned to the centre line of the Centralbahnplatz, and features a huge glazed tudor arch window between two clock towers under curved domes. alt=View of the ticket hall. Behind the facade, one might suspect a terminus, but that is not the case in Basel. Through the entrances in the clock towers, travellers reach the ticket hall under a timber-lined steel-arch structure. Like the rest of the interior, the ticket hall is broad and high. Large murals dating from the 1920s advertise tourist destinations in Switzerland. The ticket and currency exchange offices are embedded in the side wall. The baggage check-in and hand luggage storage facilities were formerly also located here, but today they are in the basement, and accessed by means of an escalator and stairs. alt=The remaining station restaurant. In the eastern part of the station, the baggage claim was formerly to be found where the travel centre is now located. The first/second class restaurants (now Migros) and the third class facility (now a brasserie/kiosk) were in the north west wing. The station was previously known for its station buffets, but these were gradually closed down in the 1990s. The high rooms, their walls decorated with murals, now house other commercial uses together with the sole remaining specialty restaurant. A separate entrance, on the Centralbahnstrasse west of the Centralbahnplatz, leads to the Alsace-bound trains at Basel SNCF. alt=Inside the train shed. Initially, the platform allocation at Basel SBB corresponded to the private railway age, because the platforms were separated according to the direction of travel. The station originally had 10 tracks, of which the three bay platforms 1 to 3 were previously reserved for local traffic. Tracks 1 to 10 are spanned by a five aisle train shed, which was created in 1905 by of Pratteln in Basel. The train shed is wide, and has a length of (tracks 1/2), (tracks 3/4) and (tracks 5-10). Track 4 goes through to Basel SNCF, where it becomes track 30 and the catenary can be switched from the Swiss operating current of 15 kV 16.7 Hz AC to its French equivalent, 25 kV 50 Hz AC. On the southern side of the station, a double track line, located at a lower level, connects the Basel and Muttenz marshalling yards with the line to France, and is devoted mainly to through freight trains. alt=The Passarelle. Due to the lowering of the tracks at the time of rebuilding, it was difficult to extend the station with additional tracks. On the South side, the platform system has nevertheless been augmented several times: tracks 11 and 12 have been added, the pedestrian underpass has been extended to Gundeldingen, and, in 2003, the new Passerelle was constructed to the new tracks 14 and 15. These changes, together with the introduction of a clock-face timetable in 1982 and the Rail 2000 project, achieved an increase in the station's capacity. Finally, in June 2008, the new tracks 16 and 17 went into operation. The Passerelle is an element of the new SBB CFF FFS commercial concept known as RailCity. Designed by architects Cruz and Ortiz, it runs over the tracks from the ticket hall at the western end of the train shed to the district of Gundeldingen, and links the platforms with each other. A walkway with shopping opportunities, it is long, wide, and replaced the pedestrian underpass. Today, the former underpass is used for operational and logistical purposes. With the construction of the Passerelle, the RailCenter and the information display were relocated from the ticket hall to the former luggage hall. Additionally, the 1987-built customer service ticket pavilion in the ticket hall was removed, and since then the ticket hall has been able to unfold its ambience to its fullest extent. Meanwhile, in 1998 and 1999, a new signal box was constructed on behalf of the SBB CFF FFS. The architects of this striking building were Herzog & de Meuron. Connections =Overview= alt=A train awaits departure for Italy. About 1,000 trains depart from the station daily. Nearly every 90 seconds, a passenger train leaves or stops at the station. Additionally, freight trains still use the through tracks, and post office trains enter and exit the underground postal station. =International long-distance trains= An ICE departs from Basel SBB every hour to Berlin or Hamburg and a number of other German cities. Several times a day, EuroCitys run to Milan, and TGVs to Paris. Night connections exist with Berlin, and Hamburg. There used to be a direct connection to Moscow but as of 2014 this has been discontinued. =National long-distance trains= Several times hourly, InterCity trains run to Zürich HB, Bern and Olten. At least hourly, Zürich–Chur, Olten–Lucerne–Bellinzona–Lugano, Olten–Bern–Interlaken/Visp–Brig, and Delémont–Biel/Bienne–Neuchâtel–Lausanne/Geneva can be reached. =Trinational regional trains= As a border station, Basel SBB is also aligned with regional services to Germany, France, and Switzerland. The Basel Regional S-Bahn network ranges from Frick/Laufenburg in the east, Olten in the south, and Porrentruy in the west to Mulhouse in the north west and Zell im Wiesental in the north east.

It is located north of downtown Lanzhou. It was opened in 1970 and serves as a major air hub for the province of Gansu and western China. There are eight gates served by aerobridges in the terminal. A new larger (61,000 m²) Terminal 2 is located to the South, adjacent to the existing terminal. The new terminal adds nine aerobridges. Lanzhou Airport is a focus city for Hainan Airlines. Passenger traffic at Lanzhou Airport in 2014 was 6.58 million, with 10 million passengers per year projected for 2020. History Lanzhou's first airport, Gongxingdun Airport, was located just from the city centre. By 1957, the Civil Aviation Administration of China decided that Gongxingun Airport's location was too restrictive for the aviation needs of Lanzhou and designated a new site near Zhongchuan town. In 1968 construction was started on Lanzhou airport and on July 26, 1970, the maiden flight took place with the first aircraft landing of an Ilyushin Il-14. On June 15, 1997, an expansion project was officially started. In 2006, the Gansu Airport Group and Hainan Airlines Group begin a strategic reorganization. In 2010, Lanzhou airport's passenger throughput exceeded 3 million people a year. and the second expansion project started. Lanzhou Airport Terminal 2 officially started construction in 2010, after preliminary design approval and with an investment budget of 1.488 billion yuan. In 2013, Lanzhou airport's passenger throughput exceeded 5 million passengers per annum, increasing the official Lanzhou airport ranking among the major airports within China. Terminal 2 opened in 2015 and later that year the Lanzhou–Zhongchuan Airport intercity railway between the airport and Lanzhou's urban area opened. The third expansion phase started in 2019. At a cost of 31.69 billion Yuan, a new Terminal 3 will be built, two new 4000 meter long runways and facilities will be expanded. Terminal 3 will be four times larger than the current combined terminal floor area.http://www.ndrc.gov.cn/zcfb/zcfbtz/201902/t20190228_929590.html The entirety of adjacent namesake Zhongchuan town and several villages, totaling , were demolished to make way for the expansion, and residents were relocated to Lanzhou and Lanzhou New Area. Terminal complex While nominally two terminals, they are connected airside by a lengthy walkway and operate as a single building. Airlines operating from one terminal may use gates at the other. =Terminal 1= Shaped like the letter T, this terminal consisted of eight airbridges. The original terminal had a single airside level for arrivals and departures. Arrivals were segregated by a glass screen from departing passengers. Check-in was handled on the upper level, while the lower level housed the baggage hall. With the opening of Terminal 2, this terminal's landside facilities have been shut down for refurbishment and parts of the terminal will be mothballed until future growth warrants the reopening of these facilities. Airside lounges, gates and shops remain in use. =Terminal 2= Designed and shaped to resemble the wing of flying geese, at 61,000m2, this terminal greatly increased the operational space at Lanzhou Airport. It added an extra two piers to the existing terminal. It houses 30 extra check-in desks, 12 passenger gates, 9 airbridges and separate levels for arriving and departing passengers. The new terminal was opened for travellers in February 2015. =Terminal 3= Terminal 3 construction preparations started in 2019. It will have a floor area of , dwarfing T1 and T2. The terminal will have 87 gates. Airlines and destinations =Passenger= =Cargo= Ground transportation connections =Rail= Zhongchuan Airport Railway Station The Lanzhou–Zhongchuan Airport intercity railway between the airport and the city started operation on 2015-09-30. It provides fast train services between the Zhongchuan Airport railway station and the new major transportation hub at Lanzhou West railway station then terminates at the older Lanzhou railway station. =Road= ;Shuttle bus There are three Airport Express Shuttle Bus services available from the airport. All routes cost 30RMB. * Line 1 runs to the Lanzhou Eastern Hotel, Tianshui Middle Road, opposite Lanzhou University western gate. The return service leaves from opposite the JJ Sun Hotel (next to CAAC Ticket Office), Donggang West Road. Travel time is about one hour, due to the distant nature of airport from the city centre. This is the closest service to Lanzhou Railway Station. * Line 2 runs to Golden Lily Hotel, Xijin East Road, via Taohai Market, Anning West Road. This is the closest service to Lanzhou West Railway Station. * Line 3 runs to Qingshuiqiao in western Lanzhou. ;Taxi Taxi service is relatively expensive due to the long distance to the airport, about 150RMB. Many taxis will be reluctant to use their meter and demand a flat 200RMB fare to downtown Lanzhou despite being illegal to do so. Overall there is little time travel advantage over using the Airport Express bus. {  Departure Hall of Lanzhou Airport Terminal 1  Existing terminal as seen from the south.

The film stars Mohan Agashe and Smita Patil in the lead roles. The film won President's Silver Medal for Best Feature Film in Marathi at the National Film Awards. It is considered to be one of the greatest musical hits of all time in Marathi cinema. It is based on a book by G. N. Dandekar. Though the music achieved all-time hit status, the film was a box office disaster. Plot The story revolves around a tribal caste called the Thakar. Nagya (Mohan Agashe) is a drummer who has a passion for being a \\"pure one\\" (punyavant). He meets Chindhi (Smita Patil), who has abandoned her husband as she considers him useless. They both fall in love and strive hard to be united. Once when Nagya goes to jungle for wood-cutting, a queen honey bee attacks him and one of his eyes is injured. He decides to take revenge. The beehives are located high on a nearby difficult to climb peak {Lingoba}. He decides to cut all the beehives so that the queen-bee runs away. Meanwhile, Chindhi becomes pregnant with Nagya, but she still supports his dangerous attempt to climb the peak. Nagya then climbs the peak and cuts the hives. Chindhi is waiting at the base of the peak, but the disturbed honey- bees attack her and she dies in the incident. Nagya, in search of Queen honey- bee, loses his own queen[wife] in the end. This is a classic paradox, where he succeeds (Jait re jait, means WIN-WIN) in his revenge, but loses his wife. The film highlights all the traditions of the Thakar tribe.

It is about southwest of the city in Gyazhugling, Gonggar County of Shannan. The airport is close to the road to Tsetang, the seat of Nêdong District and the capital of Shannan. At an elevation of , Lhasa Airport is one of the highest in the world. It was built in 1965, a second runway was built in 1994, and terminal facilities were upgraded in 2004. History Building an airport in Tibet, which is termed in flying parlance as going over a \\"hump\\" in the Tibetan Plateau, has gone through a process of trial and error through many hazardous air routes and several fatal accidents during World War II. =Damxung Airport= The first airport began construction in 1955 and completed was in May 1956, across river from Gongtang township in the southwest of Damxung County at a height of . Due to remoteness this airport was serviced by a gravel runway but needed constant maintenance due to high winds blowing away to stones.http://m.tibet.cn/eng/economy/projects/201512/t20151203_5721842.html Flights were sparse with a limited daily window in the morning, departure before afternoon to avoid high winds and eventually limited to flights to one per month or one month and a half.http://www.vtibet.com/en/calture/tibettology/201407/t20140702_209243.html There was no terminal building (added later with two aprons on the southwest end) and staff lived in a small building on site. An Ilyushin Il-12 and a Convair CV-240-401 were the first aircraft that landed at Damxung airport from the north and south. They thus broke the jinx of the \\"forbidden air zone\\", and this was acclaimed a feat. It took almost nine more years before the first Beijing-Chengdu-Lhasa air route became operational in 1965. =Gonggar Airport= In 1965 the Gonggar Airport was constructed to provide a more reliable location. Damxung Airport was decommissioned later (site partially converted into a race course with footprint of runway visible from satellite views) and the Lhasa Aviation Office was moved from Damxung to Gonggar Airport. This established the Gonngar Airport as the second airport in Tibet. Over the years, with more expansion of the facilities, Gonggar became the domestic hub in the Tibetan Plateau connecting many other airports in Tibet. Geographic environment View from inside the terminal Gonggar Airport is in Gyazuling township of the Gonggar County. It is built in the county where Yarlung Tsangpo River (the Brahmaputra River) is very wide on the right bank (southern bank) of the river providing facilities for the runways. It is for this reason that the airport was constructed at this location, though away from Lhasa where space was a limitation. The airport lies to the west of Rawa- me, which is the capital of the county, at the entry of the Namrab Valley, from Tsetang. Within a radius of the airport is surrounded by mountains with elevations ranging from . Access to the airport from Lhasa has been further facilitated by constructing a road tunnel, which has reduced the distance and time taken to reach the airport from Lhasa by 40 minutes; time of travel from Lhasa is now about 40–60 minutes by shuttle bus services. The tunnel and Lhasa Airport Expressway opened in July 2011. Airport description At an elevation of above sea level, the airport is one of the highest in the world. Its runway, with airport rank 4E, at with a width of , is designed to handle wide-bodied aircraft in the thin Tibetan air. It has an area of with the passenger handling facilities of ticketing office, the baggage collection beltways and visitors gallery on the first floor of the new terminal building, and the departure lounge on the second floor with shopping malls, kiosks and restaurants. There are four aero bridges (one two-way bridge and three single- way bridges) to facilitate passengers to board and disembark from the aircraft. The airport began operation in 1965 with flights to Beijing and Chengdu commencing that March. Recent additions included the expansion of the existing terminal in 2004 and as a result the airport has the facility to check in 1,300 passengers per hour during peak hours. The airport has parking facilities for five Airbus A340 or seven Boeing 757 aircraft. The airport is connected to the rest of China, which includes cities such as Beijing, Chengdu, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Chongqing, Xi'an, Xining, Kunming, Diqing and Chamdo Region. There is an international route connecting Kathmandu, Nepal and Lhasa. Flight handling All flights to and from the Lhasa Gonggar Airport are handled by seven Chinese-based airlines: Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, Shenzhen, Hainan, Sichuan, and Tibet Airlines. During tourist season (roughly April to October), there can be as many as 40 domestic flights every week to and from Gonggar, carrying on average as many as 700,000 passengers every year. There is only one international route at present: a once or twice weekly (depending on the season) flight to and from Kathmandu. It is typically not possible to purchase air tickets directly from these carriers given the requirement of obtaining the necessary governmental travel permit, which is not the same as the visa to gain entry into the rest of mainland China. It was expected that this figure would reach 110,000 by the year 2010. Pilots landing at Lhasa Gonggar Airport must be specially trained in handling manoeuvres at landing at the high altitude of . Incidentally, Nagqu Dagring Airport is expected to become the world's highest altitude airport by 2014 at 4,436 meters above sea level. Given the frequency of strong air currents picking up in the afternoon, most flights into the airport are scheduled in the morning. A night landing facility was created by fixing navigational lighting facilities on the runway at a cost of 99 million yuan (US$13.2 million) only in 2007. This adds to the handling capacity of the airport by about 40%. The night landing facility was commissioned on 14 November 2007 with the landing of an Airbus A319 aircraft of Air China carrying 90 passengers. This facility was made operational initially once a week on Wednesdays from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport in Sichuan Province. With this facility the airport planned to handle 1.1 million passengers every year by 2010, as against 1.005 million in 2007. The airport was able to accommodate an Airbus 330 overnight for the first time on April 11, 2017, a problem due to the airport's high altitude. Infrastructure A new highway between Lhasa and the Gonggar Airport has been built by the Transportation Department of Tibet at a cost of RMB 1.5 billion yuan. It is a four-lane road of length. This road is part of the National Highway 318; it starts from the Lhasa railway station, passes through the Caina Township in Qushui County, terminates between the north entrance of the Gala Mountain Tunnel and the south bridge head of Lhasa River Bridge, and en route goes over the first overpass of Lhasa at Liuwu Overpass.

The station is situated on Swiss soil, but is operated by the German railway company Deutsche Bahn. A customs border is situated in the passenger tunnel between the tracks and the station hall. It is the only railway station that is operated as part of the German national rail network yet not located within Germany's state boundaries, and it is listed as a Swiss heritage site of national significance.Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance (1995), p. 78. The station is served by three lines of the tri- national Regio S-Bahn Basel, and ICE and EC/IC lines to and from Freiburg, Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Berlin and other cities in Germany. The station is the smaller of the two largest railway stations in Basel, the other being Basel SBB, which is operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS). History In March 1838, the Grand Duchy of Baden State Railways started working on a railway line from Mannheim via Heidelberg, Karlsruhe and Freiburg im Breisgau. This line was called Badische Hauptbahn (Baden Main Line) or Rheintalbahn (Rhine Valley Line). A Swiss railway commission desired a continuation of the line into Basel and contacted the Grand Duchy of Baden in 1842. In January 1851, the Rheintalbahn line reached the village of Haltingen, close to the Swiss border. Since the two governments had not agreed about how to build the station in Basel yet, the passengers were transported across the border with hackney carriages. Finally, on July 27, 1852, a treaty became effective between the government of Baden and the Swiss Confederation. This treaty is still effective today. The start of construction was further delayed, however, by the Swiss insisting on a terminal station and the Badische Staatseisenbahnen insisting on a through station in favour of the planned extension of the line towards Waldshut. Badischer Bahnhof, 1862 The first Baden Railway station of Basel was built as a through station at nowaday's Messeplatz square about 800 meters west of today's one. The line from Haltingen to Basel was opened on February 19, 1855 with a temporary wooden station building. A further line to Konstanz in Baden was connected to the southern end of the station in 1856, and by April 10, 1859 Switzerland and Baden had finally agreed to build a permanent station, of which the construction started in May. The street entrances of the station building opened to nowaday's Riehenring street. In 1875, the communication railroad to Basel Swiss station was opened, leaving the Baden station together with the railway to Konstanz. The increase of railway traffic in the beginning of 20th century afforded larger facilities. To get space for the urban development of Kleinbasel, the government of Basel insisted on a new station on a new site. It was chosen straight north northwest of the railway bridge across the Rhine. The station was moved to its current location between 1906 and 1913. Special situation Basel Badischer Bahnhof The Badischer Bahnhof is located on Swiss territory, but due to the 1852 treaty between the Swiss Confederation and the state of Baden (one of the predecessors of today's Germany), the largest part of it (the platforms and the parts of the passenger tunnel that lead to the German/Swiss checkpoint) is treated as an inner-German station and is operated by the Deutsche Bahn. The shops in the station hall, however, are located in Switzerland, and the Swiss franc is used as the official currency there (although the euro is universally accepted). The customs controls are located in a tunnel between the platforms and the station hall; international trains which continue to Basel SBB usually have on-board border controls. Passport controls were abolished when Switzerland joined the Schengen Area in 2008.

South Side, a part of the Rockville Centre School District, serves grades 9 through 12 and boasts a variety of academic, extra- curricular and athletic programs, including the International Baccalaureate (IB) Curriculum in junior and senior years. School district boundaries can be found in Rockville Centre and South Hempstead. In 2008 South Side was ranked 47 in the top 100 high schools in the nation by Newsweeks \\"The Top of the Class: The complete list of the top 1,300 top U.S. high schools\\".http://www.newsweek.com/id/39380/?q=2008/rank/1/ South Side has maintained this distinction, at No. 65 in 2003, No. 45 in 2005, No. 32 in 2006 and No. 44 in 2007. The primary address for South Side is 140 Shepherd Street, Rockville Centre, New York 11570. Located further south in Rockville Centre is the \\"Greenhouse\\". Established in 1975, the purpose of this off-site school is to provide a different approach to teaching students with academic or personal troubles as well as different scheduling and academic programs. The main building has two floors. As of the 2014–15 school year, the school had an enrollment of 1,092 students and 93.7 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.6:1. There were 109 students (10.0% of enrollment) eligible for free lunch and 28 (2.6% of students) eligible for reduced-cost lunch.School data for South Side High School, National Center for Education Statistics. Accessed December 12, 2016. School history The school's name reflects its status as the first high school on Long Island's south shore, east of Jamaica. It has retained that name though most of Long Island's incorporated villages have established high schools named for their village. The Shepherd Street address is the third location for the school, its first site (1892–1923) was on College Place, now the Municipal Building of Rockville Centre. Its second site (1924–1954) on Hillside Avenue is now South Side Middle School. The school has served grades 9–12 since 1982–83, having previously been a 10–12 institution with the freshman attending what was then South Side Junior High School along with the seventh- and eighth-graders. The switch occurred as the district's sixth-graders moved to the Junior High, with that institution becoming the Middle School. The most prominent architectural characteristic of the current building is the colonnade adorning the entrance on the west side of the building. This feature gives its name to the school's annual yearbook, The Colonnade, but is unusual in that it is not associated with either of the school's grand entrances to the north and the south, which face the parking lots and athletic fields. Facilities The school district headquarters, the William H. Johnson Administration Building, is on the high school campus; it was given its current name in 2020. Sports South Side High School has a rich athletic history dating back to the 1920s. Three teams (Boys Lacrosse, Girls Volleyball, and Girls Soccer) have won New York State Championships. By far the most famous team is the 1971 Boys Basketball Team, captained by Beaver Smith, which won the last Nassau County championship contested in the Island Garden, a 5,200 seat Quonset-style arena formerly located in West Hempstead, which doubled as the home of the ABA New York Nets (New York State high schools did not hold a State championship tournament until the 1980s). Another successful team is the Lady Cyclones Soccer Team. In the past 20 years, the Lady Cyclones have won 17 State Championships including most recently in 2012, when the girls dominated their opponents, scoring 63 goals and only allowing 6, going 18–0–1. In 2013 the girls were ranked #1 in the State and #4 in the nation. At the end of the 2009 season, the varsity girls soccer team was ranked #1 in the nation. In 2003–04 the boys' basketball teams captured the county championship for the first time since 1998, besting all Nassau County opponents. 2004 also saw the boys' lacrosse program capture its first State Lacrosse Championship. =Red and Blue= Red and Blue is an annual competition held by South Side High School since 1916. \\"Red and Blue started when girls weren't allowed to participate in team sports\\".NYTimes.com, \\"Rockville Centre 'Color Wars' Never End\\", March 24, 2002 Author and historian Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote extensively about Red and Blue in her autobiographical memoir \\"Wait Till Next Year.\\" Since 1979 Title IX has mandated that girls have equivalent access to sports and other activities, but the tradition has lived on, with approximately 300 (mostly) female students participating each year.

In this regard, U.S. President Bill Clinton had issued an important directive in which he expressly stated the following: Prior to April 1, 1997, the effective date of IIRIRA, a legal remedy known as \\"suspension of deportation\\" was available to aliens in deportation proceedings. Although functionally similar to cancellation of removal, suspension of deportation did not distinguish between \\"permanent residents\\" of the United States and \\"nonpermanent residents.\\" To obtain suspension of deportation, an applicant under the pre-IIRIRA standard was required to fulfill the following: (1) continuous physical presence in the United States for a period of at least seven years; (2) \\"good moral character\\" during that entire period; and (3) that the applicant's deportation from the United States would result in \\"extreme hardship\\" to the applicant or any qualifying relative, which was mainly the applicant's spouse, parents, or children, who were either citizens or LPRs of the United States. After these three requirements were met, the LPR was granted relief irrespective of his or her age, health, race, color, religion, nationality, political affiliation, political opinion, etc. Approval standard for cancellation of removal as of April 1997 =Lawful permanent residents of the United States= permanent resident card (green card), which lawfully permits its holder to live and work in the United States similar to that of all other Americans. Before any legal immigrant is naturalized as a U.S. citizen, he or she must be a green card holder for at least 5 years and satisfy all other U.S. citizenship requirements. An LPR (green card holder), especially one who was admitted as a refugee under 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c), is fully protected by the Constitution and laws of the United States against every form of illegal deportation.

Congress intentionally avoided using any term that is contrary to granting.

Earthquake in Zipland is also recommended for therapists and school counselors as an innovative form of interactive play therapy, as well as a tool for support groups dealing with children of divorce. The interactive story includes all the proven benefits of bibliotherapy brought to life on screen. The game is available in two versions, one for parents and children and one for therapists and helping professionals.

Biography He was born in 1879. He was elected at the 1922 general election as Member of Parliament (MP) for Kidderminster, and held the seat until his defeat at the 1945 general election. Wardlaw-Milne was often seen as being on the right wing of the Conservative Party and during the tough economic times of the early 1930s, Wardlaw-Milne recommended that free education should be abolished. = Vote of no confidence = During June–July 1942 Sir John was involved in an attempt to force Winston Churchill out in a vote of no confidence. The vote followed what Churchill in his war memoirs called \\"a long succession of misfortunes and defeats\\".The Hinge of Fate, p. 392 The Conservative politician Robert Boothby, appearing in Martin Gilbert's documentary on Churchill's life, said, \\"It was the only time in the whole of the war that I saw him [Churchill] looking really anxious, because the only thing in the world he feared was Parliament.\\" Wardlaw-Milne proposed the vote of no confidence on Churchill's running of the war. His speech, according to biographer Roy Jenkins, was \\"a fiasco.\\"Jenkins, Churchill, p. 695 According to Jenkins, Wardlaw-Milne felt that operation of the war should be turned over to > a dominating figure to run the war and also a generalissimo to command all > the armed forces. It was not clear whether Milne wanted them to be the same > person.... However, it did not greatly matter for he turned his whole > argument into bathos by nominating the Duke of Gloucester, the third son of > George V, for either or both of these jobs.\\" Jenkins, Churchill, p. 695 Gloucester was regarded as \\"a figure of fun\\" and \\"[t]he idea that he could be turned into a dominating warrior prince scuppered both his own and Wardlaw- Milne's reputations\\" Churchill's own assessment was that \\"the combination of a Supreme War Commander with almost unlimited powers and his association with a Royal Duke seemed to have some flavour of dictatorship about it\\".Churchill, Hinge of Fate, p. 397 The final vote on the proposal, on 1 July 1942, was 475 to 25 in favor of Churchill's government.Churchill, Hinge of Fate, p. 408 Jenkins gives the vote as 477 to 27, including tellers.Jenkins, Churchill, p. 697 =Death= He died on 11 July 1967.  Honours  For his political and public services, Wardlaw-Milne was made a Knight Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire on 31 May 1932.

It is an artificial hill, with views of the ocean, located in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. The gardens include a large system of waterfalls, streams and ponds, a museum dedicated to palms, and a display shade house. The project was started in 1995 on a former landfill and only opened to the public in 2014.Los príncipes de Asturias inauguran el Palmétum hoy The valuable palm collection gathers about 600 species of palms and it is focused on the ones native to world islands. Trees and shrubs of other plant families are also displayed, organised in \\"biogeographical sections\\". All gardens are maintained with no pesticides and no fertilizers, different species of wild birds are easily seen in the palmetum.  Location  The palmetum is located in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, capital city of the Western Canary Islands, in the district of Cabo Llanos, by the Parque Marítimo César Manrique. It is an artificial hill originally made of rubbish: a former landfill of the city, by the ocean. The average annual temperature is 21,7 °C and the absolute minimum temperature recorded is 13 °C.  History  The old landfill was shut in 1983. The creation of the gardens was started in 1995 with funding from the European Union and the City of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, under the botanical direction of the Agronomist Manuel Caballero Ruano and the biologist Carlo Morici. The landscape designer Carlos Simón directed the construction of various lakes and waterfalls and the plantation of the earliest gardens in 1996-1999. The development was paralysed in 2000 for lack of funding. Since then it was kept with basic maintenance until 2006. During 2007 and 2008 some major works were performed in order to push it further. The whole watering system was replaced and the unfinished southern slopes were landscaped. Living collections have been improved and ordered and new geographical sections have been started. More works followed in 2010-2011, with the construction of the entrance building and the hardscaping of roads and circles. While the park was still closed, the first public guided tours were offered throughout 2013, and it was eventually inaugurated in 2014 by the princes of Spain. It became an official botanical garden in 2015. Today it is open daily and visited by locals and tourists, with thriving school programs and regular exchanges with other institutions.  Buildings and Facilities  * The entrance building, has a reception with a small shop and the exhibit hall with a palm museum. Offices are located on the upper floor. A tower with a spiral staircase and an elevator links the entrance with a bridge to the gardens. * The octagon, El Octógono, is a half-sunken shade house of 2.300 m², designed to host the most delicate species. It contains a dense display of tropical plants, crossed by winding paths, streams, bridges, and waterfalls. * The Ethnographical Palm Museum is a semisubterranean structure, partly covered in vegetation. This building is unfinished and still closed. It will host the existing collection of palm-related objects and dry specimens, lecture room.  Living collections  Hemithrinax ekmaniana in the Caribbean section. As of 2016, the plant collection includes at least 1853 plant taxa, with focus on island floras. 420 plant taxa are in the IUCN red list: 73 are critically endangered and 2 extinct in the wild. The palm collection has 573 taxa. 163 are represented by at least one adult. 192 taxa are in the IUCN red list and 38 of them are critically endangered; 42 \\"IUCN palms\\" reached the adult stage. Other well- represented families are Amaryllidaceae, Asparagaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Moraceae. The collection focuses on palms from islands and the Caribbean species are the most represented. The collection of Thrinax, Coccothrinax and Hemithrinax is one of the most complete in the world, as it proceeds from numerous field expeditions and collaborations with botanical gardens in the Caribbean, especially with La Habana, Cienfuegos and Las Tunas in Cuba, the Montgomery Botanical Center in Miami and the Jardín Botánico Nacional de Santo Domingo. Some taxa are grown in sufficient number to allow ex situ seed production of IUCN species. An outstanding case is Coccothrinax borhidiana, which is a slow and critically endangered species, represented in the palmetum by 17 specimens germinated in 1996, now fruiting in the Caribbean section.  Biogeographical Sections  Dypsis leptocheilos The surface of the hill is divided in \\"biogeographical sections\\", in order to host the palm flora from different areas of the world. They are variable in size between 1.000 and 20.000 m². Some sections are landscaped with hills, streams, ponds or waterfalls. Sections are listed below with some of the most significant species represented. * Thermophilous scrub of the Canary Islands: Anaga.

His written work is known for its dedication and commitment to fusing a socio-political reappraisal of Africa and respect for human dignity into most of his works. Early life and education Kole Omotosho was born into a Yoruba family in Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandparents after the death of his father.\\"Kole Omotoso\\", Africultures. Though the lack of a father figure could crush a young Nigerian boy, the events of his early childhood contributed a great deal to his development as a man and also as a writer. Omotosho was educated at King's College, Lagos, and the University of Ibadan and then undertook a doctoral thesis on the modern Arabic writer Ahmad Ba Kathir at the University of Edinburgh. Later life Omotosho returned to Ibadan to lecture on Arabic studies (1972–76), then moved to the University of Ife to work in drama (1976–88). He became a writer for various magazines (including West Africa) in the 1970s and was well known among Nigeria's literate elites. His major themes include interracial marriage, comic aspects of the Biafran-Nigerian conflict, and the human condition—as exemplified in friendship between the Yoruba and the Igbo and in relationships between children and parents. His 1988 historical novel about Nigeria, Just Before Dawn (Spectrum Books), was controversial and led Omotosho to leave his native country. After visiting professorships in English at the University of Stirling and the National University of Lesotho and a spell at the Talawa Theatre Company, London, he became a professor of English at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa (1991–2000).\\"Omotoso, Kole\\", in Oyekan Owomoyela, The Columbia Guide to West African Literature in English Since 1945, Columbia University Press, 2008, p. 147. From 2001 to 2003 he was a professor in the Drama Department at Stellenbosch University. He also writes a number of columns in African newspapers, most notably the \\"Trouble Travels\\" column in the Nigeria's Sunday Guardian. From 2013 to 2016, he was a patron of the Etisalat Prize for Literature.http://businessdaynigeria.com/toast-african-writers In the mid-1990s and 2010s he appeared as the \\"Yebo Gogo man\\" in a number television advertisements for Vodacom mobile phones. Omotosho is married with three children — including filmmaker Akin Omotoso and writer Yewande Omotoso — and currently lives in Centurion, Gauteng, South Africa. Themes Omotosho grew up during the rising tide of radical nationalism and was enamored by the potential that lay in the future of his country. His fiction ranges widely over the human condition, and themes include intergenerational and interracial relationships. Fela's Choice is an early example of Nigerian detective fiction. However, with the ascent of social and political decay, a few years after independence, he became deeply interested in writing about fiction. Fiction was an avenue that exists apart from the decay of real life and where deep reconstructions about life and ideas come true. It was also an avenue to experiment on social and political ideas for societal change and advancement. Omotosho's non-fiction is wide-ranging in subject matter.

Nyingchi Airport is the third airport that Tibet has put into operation. Built at a cost of 780 million yuan (96.18 million U.S. dollars), including investment by the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China (CAAC), the airport is 2,949 meters above sea level, lower than the other two civil airports, with a designed annual passenger flow of 120,000. Known as one of the world's most difficult airports for aircraft to reach, Nyingchi Airport is situated in the valley of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the Southeast of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, surrounded by over- mountains enveloped by clouds and fog throughout the year. Aircraft have to fly through the narrow and winding river valley to approach the airport. The narrowest flight path is less than 4 km from one mountain ridge along the valley to the opposite one. According to meteorological data, there are just 100 days overall with suitable weather to operate to the airport each year. The first landing of a commercial aircraft was made by an Air China Boeing 757 without passengers on July 12, 2006. Six weeks later the first commercial flight with passengers was made to the airport. The airport uses a required navigation performance (RNP) approach procedure to provide instrument approach guidance through surrounding valleys to the vicinity of the runway threshold.

His firm, J.B. Tiffany and Co., was active from 1888-1891. Around 1897 Tiffany became associated with Steinway pianos, and was manager of that company's Art Piano Department until his retirement in 1912.\\"Retires after fifteen years of service\\". Music Trade Review, December 28, 1912. In that capacity, he supervised the design and execution of the first Steinway piano presented to the White House, during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt. That 1903 piano, decorated by Thomas Wilmer Dewing and Maria Oakey Dewing, remained in the White House until 1938, when it was replaced by another Steinway and retired to the Smithsonian. In the early years of the 20th century, century Tiffany became involved with George Ashdown Audsley in the Art Organ Company, which set out to provide \\"artistic\\" organs suitable for residences. Tiffany died at his home in Yonkers, N.Y. on April 3, 1917.

These aircraft do not need a long runway to take off and land, like helicopters, but they have a speed and performance similar to standard fixed-wing aircraft in combat or other situations. Some powered-lift aircraft, like the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey used by the United States Marines, use a tiltrotor or tiltwing. These are called a convertiplane. Others like the British Harrier Jump Jet use thrust vectoring or other direct thrust techniques. The first powered-lift ratings on a civilian pilot certificate were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 21 August 1997 to pilots of Bell Helicopter, Boeing, and the United States Marine Corps.\\"Osprey Pilots Receive First FAA Powered Lift Ratings\\", www.boeing.com, 21 August 1997. 1999 Archive Definition Powered lift and thrust forces of various aircraft The term is an aircraft classification used by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the United States' FAA: Convertiplane A convertiplane uses rotor power for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) and converts to fixed-wing lift for normal flight. In tiltrotor and tiltwing designs such as the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey, the rotor swings forward to act as a propeller in forward flight. Some designs have a ducted fan design, in which the propeller is surrounded by a large ring-shaped duct to reduce tip losses. = Tiltrotor = An USAF CV-22 in flight The powered rotors of a tiltrotor (sometimes called proprotor) are mounted on rotating shafts or nacelles at the end of a fixed wing, and used for both lift and propulsion. For vertical flight, the rotors are angled to provide thrust upwards, lifting the way a helicopter rotor does. As the aircraft gains speed, the rotors progressively rotate or tilt forward, with the rotors eventually becoming perpendicular to the fuselage of the aircraft, similar to a propeller. In this mode, the wing provides the lift and the rotor provides thrust. The wing's greater efficiency helps the tiltrotor achieve higher speeds than helicopters. The Osprey by Bell Helicopter and Boeing is a twin- engine tiltrotor design that has two turbine engines each driving three-blade rotors. The rotors function similar to a helicopter in vertical flight, and similar to an airplane in forward flight. It first flew on 19 March 1989. The AgustaWestland AW609 (formerly Bell/Agusta BA609) tiltrotor is civilian aircraft based on the V-22 Osprey. The aircraft can take off and land vertically with 2 crew and 9 passengers. The aircraft is expected to be certified in 2017. =Tiltwing= The tiltwing is similar to the tiltrotor, except that the rotor mountings are fixed to the wing and the whole assembly tilts between vertical and horizontal positions. The Vertol VZ-2 was a research aircraft developed in the late 1950s. Unlike other tiltwing aircraft, Vertol designed the VZ-2 using rotors in place of propellers.\\"VTOL Design Problems.\\" Flight. periodical. 18 October 1957. Retrieved on 22 October 2009. On 23 July 1958, the aircraft made its first full transition from vertical flight to horizontal flight. By the time the aircraft was retired in 1965, the VZ-2 had accomplished 450 flights, including 34 full transitions. =Rotor wing= A rotor wing aircraft has been attempted but is not in wide use. The Boeing X-50 Dragonfly had a two-bladed rotor driven by the engine for takeoff. In horizontal flight the rotor stopped to act like a wing. Fixed canard and tail surfaces provided lift during transition, and also stability and control in forward flight. Both examples of this aircraft were destroyed in crashes. The Sikorsky X-Wing had a four-bladed rotor utilizing compressed air to control lift over the surfaces while operating as a helicopter. At higher forward speeds, the rotor would be stopped to continue providing lift as tandem wings in an X configuration. The program was canceled before the aircraft had attempted any flights with the rotor system. Tail-sitter A Tail-sitter is an aircraft that rests on the ground pointing vertically upwards, so that it rests on its tail. It takes off and lands vertically, tail down. The whole aircraft then tilts forward horizontally for normal flight. No type has ever gone into production, although a number of experimental variants have been flown, using both proprotor and jet thrust. Some have achieved successful transition between flight modes, as the turboprop-powered Convair XFY Pogo did in November 1954.\\"Convair XFY.\\" Flight, 12 November 1954, p. 696. The coleopter type has an annular wing forming a duct around a lift rotor. The transition to forward flight has never been achieved, although the SNECMA Coléoptère took off, hovered and landed vertically, solely on pure jet thrust. The German Focke-Wulf Fw Triebflügel was a design studied during the Second World War. It used pulse jets to power a rotor that rotated about the fuselage axis behind the cockpit. Similar to a coleopter fixed-wing aircraft, the Triebflügel was intended to take off and land on its tail, rotating on the pitch axis after takeoff and acceleration for forward flight. The design was never built beyond model wind tunnel testing. Direct thrust =Vectored thrust= The Harrier Jump Jet family of military VSTOL jet aircraft uses thrust vectoring. These aircraft are capable of vertical/short takeoff and landing (V/STOL). They are the only truly successful design of this type from the many that arose in the 1960s. These aircraft are capable of operating from small spaces, such as fields, roads, and aviation-capable ships. The Lockheed F-35B Lightning II is proposed as the next military VSTOL/STOVL design, to replace the Harrier. =Lift jets= A lift jet is a lightweight jet engine used to provide vertical thrust for VTOL operation, and is then shut down in forward flight. Some VTOL designs have used both vectored thrust from the main engine together with auxiliary lift jets. =Lift fans= A lift fan configuration is where the lifting fans are located in large holes in an otherwise conventional fixed wing or fuselage. It is used for V/STOL operation. The aircraft takes off using the fans to provide lift, then transitions to more convention fixed-wing forward flight. Several experimental craft have been flown, but only the F-35 Lightning II entered into production.

Authorship of the articles was anonymous, but is usually attributed to Samuel Adams, then the clerk of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. William Cooper, Boston's town clerk, has also been named as a possible author. The articles may have been written by a group of people working in collaboration.  History  alt=A wide view of a port town with several wharves. In the foreground there are eight large sailing ships and an assortment of smaller vessels. Soldiers are disembarking from small boats onto a long wharf. The skyline of the town, with nine tall spires and many smaller buildings, is in the distance. A key at the bottom of the drawing indicates some prominent landmarks and the names of the warships. The occupation of Boston arose from colonial resistance to the Townshend Acts, passed by the British Parliament in 1767. In response to the acts, the Massachusetts House of Representatives issued the Massachusetts Circular Letter in February 1768. Also written primarily by Samuel Adams, the circular letter argued that the Townshend Acts were a violation of the British Constitution because they taxed British subjects without their having a say in the matter. Lord Hillsborough, British Secretary of State for the colonies, ordered the Massachusetts House to revoke the circular letter. But the legislature refused. In addition to this act of colonial defiance, Hillsborough also heard reports from the Board of Customs—who were in charge of enforcing trade regulations—that Boston was in a state of anarchy. The British ministry dispatched four regiments of the British Army to restore order. These troops began arriving on October 1, 1768. The first installment of the Journal, covering the period of September 28 to October 3, 1768, was published on October 13, 1768, and was titled Journal of Transactions in Boston. Subsequent issues appeared once a week, with an average lapse of about twelve days between the reported events and the date of publication. Copy was secretly sent from Boston to New York for publication in the New York Journal on Thursday, then reprinted on Saturday in the Pennsylvania Chronicle; it was then printed in the Boston Evening Transcript, and copied in many other American newspapers and publications. The title changed several times, with the New York papers most often using Journal of Occurrences and the Boston papers preferring Journal of the Times. In an innovative approach for an era without professional newspaper reporters, the Journal presented a narrative of shocking events in Boston to the outside world. The authors claimed that what they wrote was \\"strictly fact\\", while British officials in Boston insisted that it was mostly fiction. Drawing upon the traditional Anglo-American distrust of standing armies garrisoned among civilians, the Journal presented a Boston besieged by unruly British soldiers, who assaulted men and raped women with regularity and impunity. The customs commissioners were also portrayed negatively. Historian Richard Frothingham, Jr. claimed that William Cooper, the town clerk, did most of the writing; Governor Francis Bernard attributed it to Samuel Adams and his associates. Other possible authors include Henry Knox, who was running a bookstore at the time; Benjamin Edes, co-publisher of the Boston Gazette; William Greenleaf, an employee of Edes; and Isaiah Thomas, who started out as a printer's apprentice and went on to publish the Massachusetts Spy. Historian Oliver M. Dickerson suggests that John Adams or Josiah Quincy helped with the legal material, such as the discussion of the writs of assistance in April 1769. Governor Bernard complained in a letter to Lord Hillsborough that \\"if the Devil himself was of the party, as he virtually is, there could not have been got together a greater collection of impudent, virulent, and seditious lies, perversions of the truth, and misrepresentations, than are to be found in this publication.\\" Dickerson writes in his introduction to the collected articles that it \\"doubtless\\" contains exaggerations, but that most of the allegations are supported by letters and other contemporary documents. In any case, the articles helped build the sentiment that eventually produced the American Revolution.

The gallery opened its doors on October 4, 2006 and was the culmination of many years planning to deliver a dedicated visual arts space for the Irish north east region, of an International standard in terms of design, management and environmental control. The gallery is sited in the former Drogheda Franciscan Church and part of the Friary; known locally as the ‘High Lane Church’. The Franciscans gifted the property to the people of Drogheda when they ended their 760-year association with the town in 2000. The buildings date from the early 19th century, though elements date back to earlier times and include the former Franciscan burial crypts. The main exhibition spaces are open plan and include the old Church level and a new floor at the height of the old balcony and as such, the character of the building is not lost. Highlanes Gallery has a strong survey of Irish art from the early 20th Century, and has great depth in relation to the representation of the key women painters of the period, including Nano Reid, Bea Orpen, Evie Hone, Mary Swanzy, Nathaniel Hill, May Guinness and Sarah Purser among others. It has also a number of important 18th Century works, including two important views of Drogheda by the Italian artist, Gabriele Ricciardelli, b. Naples fl. 1743/1782 d. c. 1782. The Gallery raised over €4 million from a range of international and local donors. This is a major achievement for the town as none of the cash has come from direct government funding, with several local individuals making very large cash donations to the project. The board of the gallery also made a strategic decision to purchase much of the adjoining property a number of years ago, to enable it plan for the Highlanes Gallery long-term development. Much of this property has been incorporated in the development and will be rented to cross subsidise the gallery programme. Highlanes Gallery programme over the first year will see it reintroduce the Drogheda Municipal Art Collection to the public for a three-month period. This will be complemented with borrowed works from national and private collections, in order to place the late 19th century works in the Drogheda collection in their context, which has a strong representation from women artists. Other elements of the little known Drogheda Municipal Art Collection – which dates from the 17th Century, will also be shown from time to time. Highlanes Gallery are also working closely with Banbridge District Council who are developing a space dedicated to the studio of F.E. McWilliam, this will lead to joint programming and education services in the coming years between both towns. Development work on the gallery will continue into 2007. The Highlanes Gallery has full planning permission for Phase 2 - more environmentally controlled storage areas, two further ‘cube galleries’ and an education centre in 2007. In addition, the Gallery's education programme includes in its early phase a strong emphasis on adult education, including art history lectures, early childhood work and a strong internet site aimed at teenage school children to provide them with an easy to use internet site to assist their art history education and development. The Gallery has a craftshop and cafe which specialises in craft or artisan food produced in the region, including the eastern seaboard of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Featuring then-current memes and pop culture references, the webcomic's publication schedule was intermittent at times as it grappled with artist exits and delivery issues. Erfworld was an early pioneer in crowdfunding, featuring the Toolbox, a Patreon-like funding mechanism that was created specifically for the comic and its site. The first book, The Battle for Gobwin Knob was written by Rob Balder and illustrated by Jamie Noguchi. Erfworld was recognized as one of the top 10 graphic novels of 2007 by Time Magazine. The second book, Love is a Battlefield was illustrated by Xin Ye. Before his departure, David Hahn was the artist for much of the third book, Hamsterdance versus the Charlie Foxtrot, with colors and inks by Lauri Ahonen and Lillian Chen. A portion of the webcomic series has been animated, Ken- Burns-style, with voice-over work by Arthur Chu. Erfworld followed a graphic novel format, with a new page added with each update. The setting is Erfworld, a fantasy world that adheres to the rules of a fictional turn-based strategy wargame. The narrative focused on a complex story about warring factions within this world, but most installments also contained humor, puns and side- gags about strategy-fantasy video games, role-playing games, and references to history or popular culture. The webcomic's distinctive visual style countered the theme of unending violence with an artistic sensibility (described by the creators as \\"cute\\") in which characters are drawn to look like dolls, or anime characters, or toys. Injuries draw no blood in Erfworld, and damage is cured overnight. That same aesthetic follows in its lisping use of letter changes in frequently used names, particularly replacing \\"r\\" with \\"w\\" (spidews, dwagons, and twolls instead of spiders, dragons, and trolls). The comic was originally started as an attempt to bring all of author Rob Balder's fantasy-related strips from his other comic, PartiallyClips, into the same universe and tell a story with them. Erfworld's plot, setting, and characters were released under a Creative Commons Attribution, Noncommercial, ShareAlike license. In May 2019, Balder announced that the comic would switch to 3D modeling: The stated goal of this change was to allow Rob himself to more easily create the images needed for the comic and hopefully return to a more rapid update schedule. In the same news post Rob explained that an undisclosed personal tragedy had occurred and, as a result, Erfworld would not be updating again \\"for the foreseeable future, possibly the rest of the year.\\" This new event was dubbed Horrible Thing II. Nonetheless, updates did resume later in 2019. On October 11, 2019, the website's front page was replaced with an announcement, signed by Rob and Linda Balder, which announced the permanent end to Erfworld as a webcomic as a result of a string of personal tragedies. The Erfworld updates previously published remain available in an online archive. All former functionality of the site was restricted to users with \\"heartstrings\\" badges. A few days later, the original copy of Book 1 was taken down from the GiantITP website. The authors have not yet publicly revealed what spurred the decision to shut down the comic.

Additionally, Erfworld was reviewed by Webcomic Overlook, receiving four stars out of five, and was profiled by NPR. Following on the success of the Order of the Stick Kickstarter project, in February 2012, author Rob Balder launched the Erfworld \\"Year of the Dwagon\\" Kickstarter, seeking funding for a motion comic project. The Kickstarter was extremely successful, resulting in funding of almost $85,000, making it the fourth- largest comics category Kickstarter project as of May 2012. Plot synopsis Erfworld's premise is that overlord Stanley the Plaid is conducting a military campaign to quest for the Arkentools - artifacts of ancient power left behind by the Titans who created the Erfworld. Stanley controls one of these tools, the Arkenhammer, but his quest for the others seems to have been costly and unsuccessful; the story opens as his final living warlord is killed in battle. Stanley's chief adviser, Wanda Firebaugh, convinces him to purchase a \\"Summon Perfect Warlord\\" spell as a final attempt to prevent defeat. The spell summons Earth gamer Parson Gotti (whose name is an anagram for \\"Protagonist\\") into Erfworld, where he is to serve as chief warlord under Stanley. Meanwhile, Prince Ansom of Jetstone is leading a massive coalition toward Stanley's capital, Gobwin Knob, hoping to destroy Stanley's side forever. Ansom's coalition has many members, but most prominent in the story are Jetstone (Ansom's kingdom), the forces of Transylvito (a vampire-like people) and Archons (hovering female fighters) he has hired from Charlie, a powerful overlord and mercenary. Early in the comic, one of Ansom's officers, Jillian Zamussels, flies on a scouting mission, but is captured by Stanley's forces and taken to Gobwin Knob. Wanda interrogates Jillian and, having gained magical or emotional control of her, releases her to become an unwitting double agent. During this time, Parson has been learning the battle mechanics of Erfworld and has planned an attack on Ansom's coalition. He sends a force of dwagons to make hit-and-run raids on the coalition's siege units, then draws Ansom into various traps as the coalition pursues the wounded dwagons. Jillian eventually locates the dwagons but is unwilling to attack because she is under Wanda's mind-control spell. Wanda's spell ultimately fails, however, and Jillian leads an attack that destroys the dwagons. Stanley is enraged about Parson and Wanda's unsuccessful plans and decides to take his last stand back into his own hands. He takes the surviving dwagons, then departs his capital to start his side afresh on the uninhabited site of another capital he sacked some years ago. Stanley's departure is a major turning point in the story, as these events leave Parson in sole command of the limited forces remaining at Gobwin Knob, which he must rally in a final stand against Ansom's much larger coalition. Parson quickly puts some defensive plans into action. Parson contacts Charlie, and asks him to switch sides; Charlie declines but agrees to sit the fight out. Also, as Ansom's forces scout the mining tunnels under Gobwin Knob to find weak points, Parson orders Sizemore, Stanley's dirtamancer, to ignore all but the scouts closest to the city, but to strike those with overwhelming force. This ploy tricks Ansom into thinking he has found an unguarded route to the main city garrison. Meanwhile, Ansom has dispatched a force of air units, led by Jillian, to hunt down Stanley. They eventually rendezvous with forces from Transylvito (but without Charlie's promised Archons) and head Stanley off at a narrow pass. When Stanley and his flight of dwagons arrive at this choke point, an intense fight ensues, leaving him with heavy losses. Stanley escapes under a veil cast by his foolamancer and heads back toward Gobwin knob. While Stanley is still away, the final battle for Gobwin Knob begins in earnest. Ansom first sends a large force of Jetstone units into the tunnels beneath the city, which are all destroyed by hidden traps and forces. Wanda animates the fallen enemies into an army of uncroaked soldiers, which Parson uses to protect the outer walls of Gobwin Knob. Ansom fails to breach the well-protected outer walls until he re-enlists Charlie's help at a high cost. Once the wall is breached, Ansom pours his units into the city and does a Dance Dance Revolution-style dance led by Charlie's Archons, which gives his forces a massive bonus and leads them to victory. Parson does not admit defeat though, and uses a perfidious false surrender offer as a ruse to assassinate Ansom. Parson's twoll lackey Bogroll tackles Ansom from the parapet and both fall to their deaths. Parson then collapses his own city, killing most coalition forces within the walls, but even this leaves too many enemy units alive. Parson retreats with the casters into the isolated portal room to plan the desperate final attack that will be the story's climax. Gobwin Knob is built atop an extinct volcano, so Parson orders the casters to make it erupt. The casters use magic to link the minds of Wanda the Croakamancer and Sizemore the Dirtmancer, so that with their combined skill they can uncroak the volcano. Parson and the casters flee though a portal to escape the resulting eruption, and return to find a ruin. The coalition is erased and the terrain itself changed. Sizemore shows Parson that he has discovered a fortune in gemstones exposed by the volcano, while Wanda finds the Arkenpliers (Ansom's former arkentool) and attunes to them. With the power of the Arkenpliers, Wanda is able to permanently reanimate dead units to their original strength. She uses them to \\"decrypt\\" the late Prince Ansom and most of the other fallen coalition forces as powerful new allies. The first book concludes as Parson (also known as Lord Hamster) asks Maggie, Gobwin Knob's thinkamancer, to what extent his actions are his own doing, and to what extent they were forced by magical loyalty. She tells Parson he is himself mostly responsible for the death and desolation around him. Parson appears to be both disgusted with the actions he had to take, and also empowered by learning that he has control over his own destiny. He walks away and speaks angrily to the \\"Erfworld\\". He ends his monologue by shouting \\"I won't be a gamepiece. I'm a Player. Fuck You!!\\", apparently breaking the Erfworld's \\"censorship\\", and throws his sword into the lava, where it melts. In the aftermath of this battle, Gobwin Knob is rebuilt. Wanda and Ansom lead the decrypted army on a campaign to conquer the world and convert all to the belief that attunement to the Arkentools, not royal origin, is the true source of divinely ordained rule. Book Two begins as this army confronts the forces of Jetstone, after the off-screen destruction of their ally Unaroyal. The decrypted Ansom attempts to persuade his still-living brothers to accept Toolism. They refuse, and a battle breaks out in which Ansom's brother Ossomer is captured. Ansom then makes another attempt to persuade him, only to watch Wanda order Ossomer cut down so she can decrypt him. The army then marches on Jetstone's capital city with intent to take the city, which according to the rules of Erfworld ends the side and causes the remaining cities to become \\"neutral.\\" Wanda and Parson agree that they almost certainly have the forces to win, but then Charlie uses the Arkendish (which he controls) to intervene in the battle by ending Stanley's turn. Characters =Parson Gotti= Also known as Lord Hamster, Parson serves as Chief Warlord or warlord of the side Gobwin Knob throughout the story, and as its protagonist, whisked away from Earth to Erfworld at the beginning of the first book. His name is an anagram of \\"Protagonist\\". Prior to the story, Parson is depicted as having been the author of the webcomic HamstardBalder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 14) (actually created by the authors of Erfworld as a meta- background for Parson's character and as an \\"easter egg\\"). He spent months at a time designing strategy games for his own amusement as an escape from an unsatisfying job and life. Parson questions whether Erfworld is real or just a coma dream of his, if his actions truly are his own (the summoning is supposed to put him under Stanley's command) and the ethics of his situation (his actions makes him responsible for thousands of deaths and he is serving what appears to be the evil side). Still, he chooses to tentatively accept the reality of the situation and the role he has been given. Parson is large by Erfworld standards (and fat by real-world standards), standing roughly twice as tall as Wanda Firebaugh. He does not conform to all the rules of the universe (for example, he doesn't have visible \\"stats\\" like the in-world characters). Janis has said that he is a Hippiemancer; whether this is true or not is unknown. =Stanley the Tool= Overlord of the side \\"Gobwin Knob\\" and of the nearly lost Plaid tribe.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld cast of characters, GiantITP. Retrieved June 29, 2007. Stanley serves as the superior of the protagonist throughout the story so far, with whom he is initially at odds. Originally known as Stanley the Plaid, he started off as a piker unit under King Saline IV and eventually rose to the position of warlord.Per Sizemore's narration of past events. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 79) During his service, he came to possess the Arkenhammer, a mysterious tool of divine origin, setting himself apart as a warlord, and later, ruler.Wanda: You're using the Arkenhammer to crack walnuts? / Stanley: Yeah. / Wanda: But it's divine. A tool of the Titans. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 4) Supercoolstuff.com; Squeaky Hammer - #NV680 (Internet Archive link) King Saline IV later paid to have Stanley promoted to Heir Designate. Thus, when King Saline IV was killed in an attack while Stanley was away, Stanley and his side were not dissolved and retook the city. At the time of the story, Lord Stanley is involved in an ongoing war in an effort to find the other Arkentools, believing it is the will of the Titans he control them. At the beginning of the first book, this war has reduced his realm from eleven cities to only Gobwin Knob itself.Wanda: Since you began questing for the Arkentools we have not won a battle. We once held 11 cities. Now, we hold only the capital. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 5) He had Wanda summon \\"the perfect warlord\\" in an attempt to win the battle for Gobwin Knob, which yielded Parson Gotti.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 16)Wanda: I thought we agreed I was looking for the perfect military mind. [...] / Stanley: I want that too! Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 17) In Stanley's first meeting with Parson, Parson convinced him that \\"tool\\" was a term of honor. Drawing a connection between this title and his search for the Arkentools, Stanley declared that he should henceforth be addressed as \\"Tool\\".Stanley: I have a higher calling! I am a Tool! / Wanda: I see, Lord. / Stanley: Not Lord. Tool. From now on, everyone addresses me as \\"Tool!\\" Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 20) Stanley objects strongly to being called a \\"bad guy,\\"Parson: [...] I always did like playing the bad guys, which we obviously are. [...] / Stanley: (menacingly) I'm curious, Hamster... What makes you think we're the \\"bad guys?\\" Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 31) and considers himself to be divinely favored by the Titans.Stanley: The Titans left [The Arkenhammer] here for a reason. It chose me for a divine reason. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 32) Stanley's underlings often suffer from his unchecked ego and limited patience, as well as his limited intelligence. His name (and newly assumed title) is a play on Stanley Tools. =Wanda Firebaugh= Chief Croakamancer serving Lord Stanley, and a member of the lost Croatan tribe. Wanda is the second named character to appear in the first book.Narrator: [...] And that made a bad day considerably worse...for Lord Stanley's Chief Croakamancer: Wanda Firebaugh. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 2) Her name is a play on \\"wand of fireball.\\" She is a patient and skilled manager, though she is ruthless in battle and not above using seduction as a means of manipulating others.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 54) She is skilled at many types of magic, but has stated that only Croakamancy (which she uses to animate fighters \\"croaked\\" in battle as \\"uncroaked\\"Stanley: Uncroaked. They each fell in battle and Wanda... whatchacallit... / Parson: Animated them? / Stanley: Animated them. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 27)) holds any interest for her.Sizemore: [...] I'm good at nothing beyond my specialty. But I do love to study everything. / Wanda: [...] I can manage quite a number of magicks outside Croakamancy, but I have little interest in them. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 13) She has demonstrated some ability with Hat Magic, Dollamancy, and Thinkamancy (which are all Fate magics). By the end of book one, she controls the Arkenpliers, an Arkentool that allows her to perform feats of croakamancy that are normally impossible, such as raising corpses to create lifelike intelligent \\"decrypted\\" units. =Prince Ansom= During the first book, Prince Ansom serves as Chief Warlord to King Slately of the Jetstone and the leader of the Royal Crown Coalition fighting against Stanley, and the primary antagonist.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 21) His name is a play on \\"handsome\\" (cf. Prince Charming), while his initial outfit resembled the costume worn by Evel Knievel. He was a skilled leader, warrior, and tactician but lacked modesty and was prone to reckless behavior when his pride was at stake. His crest was a radish. He carried the Arkenpliers, though he was not attuned to them, and thus could not use their full abilities.Ansom: I wield the Arkenpliers. But I am not attuned to them, as Stanley is to his artifact. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 22) He had a history of personally riding to Jillian's rescue,Wanda: [...] \\"Ansom, with his long history of personally riding to [Jillian's] rescue, flies his air units out to escort her back to the column.\\" Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 45) and Wanda believes he was in love with her.Wanda: I know [Ansom's] entire battle plan. [...] As for his weaknesses, he is in love with our prisoner. And I control her mind. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 43) While he apparently looked down on those not of royal or noble houses—Vinny correctly guessed that he despised Stanley not so much for his attacks on other peoples as for the fact he came to rule by regicide—he did, according to Jillian, honestly believe in the concept of noblesse oblige, and as a result often put himself in unnecessary danger to protect his troops. He was croaked by Bogroll and decrypted (improved uncroaking) by Wanda at the end of the first book,http://www.giantitp.com/comics/erf0145.html and serves Gobwin Knob as Chief Warlord at the start of the second,http://www.erfworld.com/book-2-archive/?px=%2F2009-10-31.jpg prior to his capture.http://www.erfworld.com/book-2-archive/?px=%2F2010-04-21.jpg =Jillian Zamussels= A female barbarian and warlord, fighting for the army of Prince Ansom. She has been known to engage in combat even when directed to avoid it.Ansom: AVOID any engagements if you can! / Jillian: Oh, I am. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 9)Ansom: [...] She's not just scouting; she's apparently hitting targets of opportunity. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 10) She has an unrealistically oversized sword. Her personal relationship with Prince Ansom is initially unclear but evolves into a romance; she declined Ansom's invitation to join him in his tent, but later that night approached it, stopped, and walked away.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 8) Later, she professes her love for Ansom after breaking Wanda's spell, and it is implied that they sleep together when she spends a night on his flying carpet. She chats casually with Wanda after being tortured and interrogated by her,Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 36) but later suddenly breaks down and collapses. It is revealed that Wanda is able to influence her feelings and thoughts.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 39) She has stated that she was originally the heir of the kingdom of Faq, an isolated and peaceful Utopian kingdom visually modeled after Japanese feudal society, and the daughter of King Banhammer, a philosopher-king who disliked his heir for her violent and aggressive ways.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 82) Her name is an approximation of \\"jillions of muscles.\\" During the intermission between books 1 and 2, she restores Faq with herself as queen, with assistance from Transylvito. =Sizemore Rockwell= A Dirtamancer in the army of Gobwin Knob and one of the few remaining members of the Plaid Tribe. In the beginning of the first book, he helped Parson learn how magic works in Erfworld.Klog: Sizemore and I have been talking magic theory. [...] He's about as knowledgable a guy as I could want for a teacher. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (Parson's Klog #2) He is very curious and loves to study all types of magic, but is unskilled in any beyond his specialty, and knows little about military matters.Klog: It's harder to get information about this stuff that it was about magic. Sizemore barely knows the basics. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (Parson's Klog #4) When forced into combat as the battle reaches Gobwin Knob itself, he is very regretful about taking lives, but reluctantly accepts it as his duty to do so. =Bogroll= A one-eyed twoll who served as a guardsman in Gobwin Knob and lackey to Parson.Bogroll: My Lords! I am reporting as Lackey retainer to Lord Hamster, by the order of my Lady Firebaugh. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 29) He was loyal and typically good-natured, although a frequent target of the other guardsmen's pranks.Bogroll: Mung, why do the other henchmen pick on me? / Mung: Because it's fun. Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 28) Bogroll was croaked by Coalition forces, having sacrificed himself in a kamikaze attack on Ansom, and cannot be decrypted due to the grievous harm inflicted on his body. Bogroll was a character in the PartiallyClips strip,Balder, R; Bogroll the Cyclops, PartiallyClips, 09-08-2002. Retrieved June 29, 2007. and is the only crossover between PartiallyClips and Erfworld. His name is a British English colloquialism for toilet paper. =Vinny Doombats= A count of the Transylvito tribe who fights for the Royal Crown Coalition. Like other Transylvitans, Vinny has the appearance of a vampire, though sunlight apparently does not harm him. Vinny seems to be a close advisor and friend of Prince Ansom, to whom he has few qualms about speaking frankly. He has confronted Ansom with his opinion that Stanley's commoner origins, not his military aggressions against several coalition members, are at the root of Ansom's antipathy toward Stanley, while assuring Ansom that this issue would not affect his personal loyalty.Vinny: You know I gotcher back no matter what. But what I can't figure out is, why are you leading this fight? [...] / Ansom: Can't it just be that I want to end a great evil? / Vinny: It could be. [...] But your beef is he's not royal, right? Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 34) As his name implies, he controls the coalition's bat scouting units. His name is a reference to Vinny Boombatz, a fictional character created by stand-up comedian Rodney Dangerfield. =Maggie= A Thinkamancer in the employ of Gobwin Knob. She is very skilled in her specialty and amoral in its application. She can send thinkagrams (telepathic messages) and link multiple casters together to combine their powers. She controlled a link with the Foolamancer Jack Snipe and the Lookamancer Misty, then later a link with the Croakamancer Wanda and the Dirtmancer Sizemore. When she broke the first link, she protected herself from the backlash at the expense of the other two. Parson planned to punish her by explicitly ordering her to break the second link and protect Wanda and Sizemore. She would probably have died from the backlash while doing so, but Parson decided against it at the last moment. She bears a passing physical resemblance to Margaret Thatcher. =Charlie= The Overlord of Charlescomm. Charlie has consistently remained offscreen, interacting with other characters via remote communication. The character of Charlie, his archons, and his penchant for mystery are likely drawn from the titular character of the 1970s television series Charlie's Angels. However, his Eyebook handle, CharlsNChrg, refers to the 80s TV show, Charles in Charge. Charlie was first contracted by Prince Ansom during the first book to supply a group of Archons to reinforce the expedition sent to rescue Jillian Zamussels. Later, after Ansom broke off the alliance in the expectation that Charlie would make a new alliance with Transylvito, Charlie instead took advantage of his release from his contract to begin dealing with Parson. Charlie shows no real commitment to either side, but does value his reputation as a mercenary who \\"stays bought\\". =Prince Ossomer= Prince Ansom's brother and chief warlord of Jetstone after the Battle for Gobwin Knob. He was captured by Wanda and then killed and 'popped again'; executed and resurrected by the Arkenpliers. However, he appears to have broken the loyalty to the pliers and became a Jetsone unit again. His name is an approximation of \\"awesomer\\". =Arkentools= Four Arkentools have appeared in the comic so far, but only three have been drawn. Arkenhammer A hammer resembling a toy croquet mallet. Owned by and attuned to Stanley the Plaid/Tool, the Arkenhammer has the power to control dwagons, glow brightly, levitate itself and its wielder, generate multiple lightning bolts, \\"rock out\\" (play heavy rock music to the benefit of combat units) turn approximately 20 percent of walnuts cracked with it into pigeons and turn some bird-like units into walnuts.Balder, R; Noguchi, J; Erfworld: The Battle for Gobwin Knob (page 126) Stanley claims the Arkenhammer has chosen him for divine reasons, and uses this, and Wanda's beckoning, as rationale for his quest to obtain the other tools. Arkenpliers A sword-sized pair of needle-nose pliers. Previously owned by but not attuned to Prince Ansom, they served as a close combat weapon and had the power in his hands to \\"turn most Uncroaked to dust\\". Stanley believed that Ansom's attack on Gobwin Knob was divinely directed to bring the Arkenpliers to him. Seen in the hands of the Unaroyal Warlord Lady Sylvia Lazarus of the Coalition immediately prior to a volcanic eruption, the Arkenpliers were recovered by Wanda from the aftermath of the explosion, and have attuned to her. They give Wanda the ability to \\"decrypt\\" corpses, restoring them to life (or at least a close approximation thereof) with nearly intact intellect, memories, and abilities - though their loyalty is to the Croakamancer that raised them rather than their previous side. Wanda can also decrypt units that normally can not be uncroaked. These abilities are unparalleled in the discipline of Croakamancy. Arkendish An object resembling a satellite dish. Owned by and attuned to Charlie, it gives him a mastery of Thinkamancy, allowing him to hack into Stanley's communications systems and communicate with Parson via his Eyebook. Parson uses the fact that Charlie is not a Royal but still attuned to it to further provoke Ansom. Parson later learns from Wanda's Decrypted Archons that the Arkendish grants Charlie many additional abilities, some of which are unknown even to them: he can handle an unlimited number of Thinkagrams, and extend some of his abilities to his personal guard of Archons. With the dish, Thinkamancer links can exist over distances, and appear to be able to be broken with little repercussion. Any commander in the world is able to contact those Archons by concentrating hard enough and long enough - this allows Charlie to contact and hire out to any side in the world. The Arkendish may also be the reason Charlie can produce Archon units. Arkenshoes A pair of red slippers, they give an attuned wearer unlimited move. The other mentioned ability is that they can send their wearer \\"home\\", depending on what home means to the one wearing them. As Overlady Judy's use of them in Book 0 has shown, can send you to a place where the concept of ruler does not apply (as that position was passed to Dame Branch) References External links * Archives of past Erfworld comics * The main cast of characters * Erfworld Wiki, maintained in part by creators Rob Balder and Jamie Noguchi (no longer publicly available) Category:2000s webcomics Category:Fantasy webcomics Category:Fantasy parodies Category:Parody webcomics Category:Creative Commons-licensed comics Category:2006 webcomic debuts Category:2010s webcomics Category:American comedy webcomics ","title":"Erfworld"},{"id":"9475775","text":"The Tre Cime di Lavaredo (; ), also called the Drei Zinnen (; ), are three distinctive battlement-like peaks, in the Sexten Dolomites of northeastern Italy. They are probably one of the best-known mountain groups in the Alps. The three peaks, from east to west, are: *Cima Piccola / Kleine Zinne (\\"little peak\\") *Cima Grande / Große Zinne (\\"big peak\\") *Cima Ovest / Westliche Zinne (\\"western peak\\"). The photo of Tre Cime was made at the foot of Torre di Toblin mountain The peaks are composed of well-layered dolomites of the Dolomia Principale (Hauptdolomit) formation, Carnian to Rhaetian in age, as are many other groups in the Dolomites (e.g., the Tofane, the Pelmo or the Cinque Torri). Until 1919 the peaks formed part of the border between Italy and Austria. Now they lie on the border between the Italian provinces of South Tyrol and Belluno and still are a part of the linguistic boundary between German-speaking and Italian-speaking majorities. The Cima Grande has an elevation of . It stands between the Cima Piccola, at , and the Cima Ovest, at . First ascents The first ascent of the Cima Grande was on August 21, 1869, by Paul Grohmann with guides Franz Innerkofler and Peter Salcher. The Cima Ovest was first climbed exactly ten years later, on August 21, 1879, by Michel Innerkofler with G. Ploner, a tourist. The Cima Piccola was first climbed on July 25, 1881, by Michel and Hans Innerkofler. The routes of these three first ascents are still the normal ascent routes; the Cima Piccola's route is the most difficult of the three. Emilio Comici was the first to climb the north face of the Cima Grande in 1933 in a party of three, after an ascent time of 3 days and 2 nights. This partly overhanging northern face is considered by climbers to be one of the great north faces of the Alps. Jacob Harmer climing Cima Grande via Comici-Dimai route  Tourism  Tre Cime Natural Park is named after the famous peaks. The visitor centre provides information concerning the trails, natural and man-made landscapes of the Sexten Dolomites and it is located at the former Grand Hotel in Dobbiaco. Numerous well-marked routes lead from the surrounding communities to and around the peaks. The most common route is from Paternkofel/Monte Paterno to the alpine hut Auronzo at 2,333 m (7,654 ft), over Paternsattel (Patern Pass) to the Locatelli alpine hut (Dreizinnenhütte) at 2,405 m (7,890 ft), and then to the peaks. There are a number of other routes as well. Nearby communities include Auronzo di Cadore (in the province of Belluno, region of Veneto), Toblach/Dobbiaco, Sexten/Sesto, and the Puster Valley (in the province of Bolzano, region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol). The area has also staged many finishes in Giro d'Italia.  History  Monument ai Bersaglieri (meaning “marksmen” in English) at Tre Cime di Lavaredo Since the front line between Italy and Austria during World War I ran through the Tre Cime peaks, there are a number of fortifications, trenches, tunnels, iron ladders, and commemorative plaques in the area.

Its distribution includes the western Atlantic, from the Antilles to Brazil, more specifically on the coast of Brazil, occurring from the Amazon River to La Plata River This species grows to a length of TL. It lives on the ocean-floor, covered in sand. The fish are flat, resembling pancakes. It preys on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. These fish are nocturnal, and typically prey on other bottom-dwelling organisms in the early morning. The Brazilian Batfish stays stationary and hidden in rock holes and other small crevices during the day. While active, it searches for prey walking along the bottom with the help of its specialized paired fins, with the illicium protracted and oscillating or exploring the substrate. The prey are either snapped up from the bottom, after visual detection, or dug out with use of the mouth and rostrum. It feeds on crustaceans (hermit crabs, true crabs, shrimps, amphipods, porcelain crabs, isopods and mysid shrimps), molluscs (snails, sea slugs and clams), polychaete worms (mostly Errantia) and echinoderms (sea urchins and brittle stars). This species can be found in the aquarium trade.

The Mark of the Claw) is a 1957 American horror science fiction film from Columbia Pictures, produced by Sam Katzman, directed by Fred F. Sears, that stars Jeff Morrow and Mara Corday. Both Sears and Katzman were well known as low-budget B film genre filmmakers.Walker 1997, pp. 241, 393. The film was released as a double feature with The Night the World Exploded. Plot Mitch MacAfee (Morrow), a civil aeronautical engineer, while engaged in a radar test flight near the North Pole, spots an unidentified flying object. Three jet fighter aircraft are scrambled to pursue and identify the object but one aircraft goes missing. Officials are initially angry at MacAfee over the loss of a pilot and jet over what they believe to be a hoax. When MacAfee and mathematician Sally Caldwell (Corday) fly back to New York, their aircraft also comes under attack by a UFO. With their pilot dead, they crash- land in the Adirondacks, where Pierre Broussard (Lou Merrill), a French- Canadian farmer, comes to their rescue, and reports seeing a monster he calls La Carcagne. MacAfee's report is met with bewilderment and skepticism, but the military authorities are forced to take his story seriously after several more aircraft disappear. They discover that a gigantic bird \\"as big as a battleship\\", purported to come from an antimatter galaxy, is responsible for all the incidents. MacAfee, Caldwell, Dr. Karol Noymann (Edgar Barrier), Gen. Considine (Morris Ankrum), and Gen. Van Buskirk (Robert Shayne) work feverishly to develop a way to defeat the seemingly invincible creature. The climactic showdown takes place in Manhattan, when the gigantic bird attacks both the Empire State Building and United Nations building. It is defeated by a special type of exotic atom, muonic atoms, deployed from the tail gun position of a B-25 bomber aircraft, which successfully collapses the creature's antimatter shield and allows missiles to hit and kill the monster. The giant bird plummets into the Atlantic Ocean outside New York, and the last sight of it is a claw sinking beneath the ocean.

Bergen * Morgan Jones as Lieutenant, Radar Officer Production According to Richard Harland Smith of Turner Classic Movies, the inspiration for the story may have been taken from media reports about scientific discoveries in the field of particle physics, dealing with matter and antimatter. Other influences included the Japanese film Rodan (1956), and the Samuel Hopkins Adams story \\"Grandfather and a Winter's Tale\\", about la Carcagne, the \\"mythical bird-like banshee from French-Canadian folklore\\".The original word is actually carcague and was introduced by Rufus B. Sage in his Rocky Mountain Life, Thayer & Eldridge, Boston, 1859, p. 170. Described as a half-wolf, half-bear of prodigious size, it is clearly a carcajou, a.k.a. wolverine, Gulo gulo. The Carcagne is absent from real French Canadian folklore. The Adams story was published in The New Yorker in January 1951. A character in The Giant Claw (Pierre Broussard) mistakes the menacing bird for la Carcagne, said to be a monster resembling a giant woman with a wolf's head and bat-like black wings and which, like the banshee, is a harbinger of death.Eggertsen, Chris; \\"Not So Scary...

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays, Chicago White Sox, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Drabek is the son of former major-league pitcher and 1990 National League Cy Young Award winner Doug Drabek.

High school Drabek attended The Woodlands High School. While there, he was an Aflac, USA Today, and Louisville Slugger high-school All-American at pitcher and shortstop. Drabek was paired on a Houston summer select team, Houston Heat, with Jay Bruce. While in high school, Drabek was named 2005 and 2006 Texas 5-A player of the year. During the 2006 spring season, the Highlanders won the Texas 5-A State Championship. During his high-school career, Drabek compiled a record of 30–1 on the mound while belting 27 home runs. In the 2006 Texas regional semifinal, he set The Woodlands High School record for most strikeouts in a game by a pitcher (19), recording a no-hitter. He first wore the number 4 as a wide receiver on The Woodlands varsity football team. He wore number 1 for baseball. Professional career =Minor League Baseball= In the 2006 Major League Baseball draft, Drabek was selected in the first round by the Philadelphia Phillies as the 18th overall pick. He had been ranked as the 12th-best prospect in the draft by Baseball America, but was drafted in a lower position because, at the time of the draft, there were concerns about personal incidents. Marti Wolever, director of scouting for the Phillies, stated of the issues that the Phillies \\"feel very good about this selection. We think everything is behind him and we're moving on.\\" The Phillies opted to develop Drabek as a pitcher in their farm system. Drabek learned from the experiences of his father. He also described his father's involvement to be \\"like having a pitching coach who lives with you ... He taught me so much, not only about the physical part of the game, but the mental part too.\\" He made four pitching appearances in the Gulf Coast League (for rookies) since his comeback from Tommy John surgery. He was then promoted to the A-Short Season Williamsport Crosscutters. After a dominant start to the season with the Class A–Advanced Clearwater Threshers, Drabek was promoted to the Class AA Reading Phillies on June 1, 2009. He was invited to the 2009 All-Star Futures Game, in which he pitched one inning. Drabek received the Paul Owens Award from the Phillies in a pregame ceremony at Citizens Bank Park on September 15, 2009. The annual award is presented to the top pitcher and the top position player in the Phillies' minor-league system.Hagen, Paul, \\"Phillies minor leaguers Drabek, Taylor receive awards\\", Philadelphia Daily News, September 16, 2009.

He was officially announced as a member of the Blue Jays on December 16, 2009. Drabek threw the second no-hitter in Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats history on Independence Day, 2010. The final score was 5-0 over the New Britain Rock Cats, as he walked two and struck out three. Drabek was voted the 2010 Eastern League pitcher of the year. Drabek attributed some of his success to a more consistent delivery, for which the point of release for different pitches appeared the same to batters. \\"In the beginning, it was like I had different movements for different pitches. Now, everything comes the same and everything stays the same.\\" =Toronto Blue Jays= Toronto Blue Jays in 2010 The Blue Jays announced on September 12, 2010, that Drabek would be promoted to make his major league debut on September 15.

On April 2, Drabek earned his first Major League win against the Minnesota Twins, throwing 101 pitches through 7 innings, with 7 strikeouts, giving up only 1 hit and 1 earned run. His father, Doug Drabek, also earned his first career win against the Minnesota Twins in 1986.

It serves students from the Watts neighborhood and the surrounding communities who are economically and academically under-served. It is operated by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles with the sponsorship of the West Province of the Society of Jesus in the United States. Verbum Dei is known for sending its graduates to some of the more selective colleges in the United States and has held a 100% success rate for sending graduating seniors to college.\\"Verbum Dei Celebrates National Commitment Day\\", Los Angeles Sentinel, May 27, 2011 The school is located in the Watts residential district of Los Angeles, California, a few blocks north of Interstate 105 (I-105) and a few miles east of Interstate 110 (I-110). History Verbum Dei was founded in 1962 by the Society of the Divine Word with the permission and recommendation of Cardinal James McIntyre to serve the educational needs of the black community of South Los Angeles. The school was named after one of Jesus' epithets, Verbum Dei (\\"the Word of God\\"). Bishop Joseph Francis, S.V.D., led the founding team and was the school's first principal. The Society maintained a presence at the school until December 2006, when the long-time Verbum Dei faculty/staff member Br. Richard \\"Rich\\" Morrill, S.V.D., left because of terminal illness. It remains to be seen if the Society will provide another of its members to Verbum Dei. At some point, the school expanded its mission in order to also serve the educational needs of the Latino community of South Los Angeles. Verbum Dei's performance began to decline in the 1980s and suffered further during the neighborhood gang wars of the 1990s; it experienced declining enrollment and instability within the administration. However, it received significant financial help in the mid-1990s and improvements were made in various buildings on campus and new buildings were added. In 2000, Cardinal Roger Mahony asked the California Province of the Society of Jesus to assist in the administration of the school, asserting that the school had to improve significantly by 2006 to avoid permanent shutdown. Verbum Dei became recognized as a Jesuit school at that point. Leading the Jesuit team was Rev. Bill Wood, S.J. The school became a member of the Cristo Rey Network and adopted its current scholastic model (see Corporate Work Study Program below) in 2002. The school has joint accreditation by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) and the Western Catholic Education Association (WCEA). Verbum Dei also has accreditation by the West Province of the Society of Jesus. The Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary have been providing a sister to the Verbum Dei staff for several years. Corporate Work Study Program Like other members of the Cristo Rey Network, Verbum Dei assigns students to jobs that are \\"donated\\" by local white-collar companies and non- profit entities in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. This experience is intended to acclimate students to corporate culture, build their character and provide a motive for seeking higher education and productive careers. The money earned by the students defrays the cost of the students' education. Participating organizations give one \\"full-time equivalent\\" student internship for a fee of $28,000. The position is filled by carefully selected young men from low-income families with an average work attendance of 99 percent. Each student works five full days a month on a rotational basis, and they attend classes and participate in extracurricular activities the remaining days. Ninety-seven percent of the student interns receive a performance evaluation of good or excellent. While almost all students benefit from various internship experiences, 37 percent of seniors have remained at the company they were placed with in their freshman year. Verbum Dei provides transportation, insurance, workers' compensation, and work permits for its student interns. The CWSP staff has a program coordinator to co-manage the students. \\"Quick Facts about the Corporate Work Study Program\\" , Verbum Dei website Activities Verbum Dei High School's teams have won national championships in various sports, including basketball.\\"Verbum Dei CIF Championships\\" , Verbum Dei website * Basketball: CIF champions – 1969 through 1974, 1979, 1994-1995, 1998-1999, 2002-2003; runners-up – 1978, 1990, 1993, 1996, 2004 * American football: CIF champions – 1981, 1982, 2006 * Track & field: CIF champions – 1993, 1997, 1998; runners-up – 1979, 1983 Students can choose from 22 extracurricular activities, including working to produce films in partnership with Underground film company with the assistance of J.

It was owned by Viewers Choice Canada Inc., which at the time of its closure was majority-owned and managed by Bell Media, with minority partners Rogers Media and ESPN Inc., and had been carried by various cable and IPTV service providers, primarily in Eastern Canada. Launched in September 1991, Viewers Choice was the first pay-per-view service permitted to operate in Eastern Canada (a counterpart in Western Canada also used the Viewers Choice brand name for several years), and was the sole English- language PPV provider in that region until 1999. However, it shut down on September 30, 2014, as the service's two main owners at the time, Bell and Rogers, had each gained full ownership of a competing general-interest PPV service (Vu! and Sportsnet PPV respectively). Viewers Choice said it would be working with its remaining partner service providers to transition to other pay-per-view services. Overview The Viewers Choice pay-per-view service consisted of 45 standard-definition channels and two high-definition channels. Programming included movies, concerts, live combat sport events such as boxing and mixed martial arts (UFC), and live professional wrestling events (WWE, WCW, ECW, and TNA). Pornographic content was also available through the Adam and Eden services. Adam featured content for homosexual men, while Eden featured content of interest to heterosexual men. Although Viewers Choice (and pay-per-view services in general) continued to be a main provider of big- ticket live events, much of their movie content had been duplicated by video on demand (VOD) services operated by cable and IPTV companies (and as noted below, Viewers Choice was not available on any Canadian satellite provider, from late 2007 to its closure in 2014). As a result, many cable systems had been slowly reducing the number of pay-per-view channels carried. In an effort to compete with VOD, Viewers Choice launched \\"All Day Ticket,\\" which allowed customers to purchase a movie for up to a 24-hour time period until 6:00 AM (local time) the next day, and view the movie as many times as they wished until the time period expired. History =Launch as monopoly provider= The Viewers Choice logo from May 1993 to April 2004. The text below the logo was first used in March 1996. In March 1991, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) granted a broadcasting licence to Viewer's Choice Canada to operate a regional pay-per-view service serving Eastern Canada (Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces). Viewer's Choice Canada was a partnership between Astral Communications with 50.1%, Rogers Pay Per View Inc. (a subsidiary of what is now called Rogers Media) with 24.95%, and TSN Enterprises (part of what is now known as CTV Specialty Television Inc.) with 24.95%.Decision CRTC 91-160 CRTC 1991-03-26 The service launched on September 5, 1991 using the \\"Viewer's Choice\\" name on-air. For its first year and a half, it used the same graphics and logos as the Viewer's Choice service in the United States (now In Demand). In early 1993, Viewer's Choice introduced its own logo and on-screen CGI idents, which were used until April 2004. The old logo was 3 triangles with a rectangle with the words \\"VIEWER'S CHOICE\\". The name was later simplified to \\"Viewers Choice\\" without an apostrophe. Originally, Viewer's Choice was the monopoly provider of pay-per- view service in Eastern Canada, while Western International Communications (WIC) was granted a similar monopoly for its Home Theatre service in Western Canada, mirroring the regions held by Astral and WIC for pay television service (The Movie Network and Superchannel, respectively). However, from 1993 until 2007, Home Theatre operated under the Viewers Choice name and used the same satellite feeds. =Entering competition= Viewers Choice's monopoly on pay-per-view service in Eastern Canada ended in 1999, when Bell ExpressVu (now Bell Satellite TV) was permitted to launch its own PPV service, Vu!, dropping Viewers Choice in the process. Shortly thereafter, Vu! also began offering pay-per-view service to other service providers, meaning that Viewers Choice was now competing with Vu! for the right to supply cable providers, though on any given service provider only one of these services would be made available to customers. Shaw Communications purchased Home Theatre (the service branded as \\"Viewers Choice\\" in Western Canada) in 2001. By 2006, it was able to switch its licence to a national one; the transition was completed on December 27, 2007, when Shaw Broadcast Services replaced the Viewers Choice-originated feeds with a \\"PPV\\"-branded service. This displaced Viewers Choice from Shaw, Star Choice (now Shaw Direct), and any other system receiving its pay-per-view feeds via Shaw Broadcast. As a result of this change, and since the only other satellite distributor (Bell TV) was already offering Vu! instead, carriage of Viewers Choice was restricted to cable systems and other providers able to receive the feeds via terrestrial fibre. Viewers Choice Canada Inc. was originally the largest shareholder and managing partner (40%) in the French language pay-per-view service Canal Indigo, launched in 1997. However, on March 20, 2008, Groupe TVA announced it would be purchasing the remaining shares in the service from all other shareholders, including Viewers Choice Canada Inc. The CRTC approved the sale later that year. On March 6, 2012, the CRTC approved Viewers Choice's request to remove its regional restrictions and allow it to broadcast nationally.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2012-135 CRTC 2012-03-06 In its final years, Viewers Choice added more shows such as The Maury Show, Judge Judy, among others. =Acquisition by Bell and shutdown= Following Bell Media's 2013 acquisition of Astral, it took control of Viewers Choice, owning a net interest of approximately 70% in the service (through the 50.1% previously owned by Astral, and through 80% ownership of CTV Specialty, which itself owns 24.95% of Viewers Choice). Bell simultaneously maintained full ownership of competing provider Vu!. In July 2014, industry news website Cartt.ca reported that Bell Media was notifying cable providers that Viewers Choice would be shutting down on September 30, 2014. The notices were issued just after the CRTC renewed the licences for various PPV services, including Sportsnet PPV, a service wholly owned by Rogers (and carried by both Rogers and Cogeco alongside Viewers Choice) which was previously restricted to sports and special events. Under the renewed licences, all PPV providers would be subject to standard conditions of licence permitting a full range of PPV programming including movies, implying that Rogers could use the Sportsnet PPV licence to take full control of the pay-per-view lineup and corresponding revenues on its cable systems, much as Bell and Shaw have already done. In a later press statement confirming the decision, Bell stated that \\"[t]he two co- owners of VCC, Bell and Rogers, both have their own pay-per-view services and thus feel there is no need to keep the service operating as a standalone entity\\", but will work with service providers to ensure a smooth transition to another PPV service. The Viewers Choice channels left the air between 10:00pm and 12:00 midnight EDT on the evening of September 30, 2014. The final programs scheduled for the various channels included replays of the previous weekend's UFC 178 event; movies, including Winter's Tale, 300: Rise of an Empire, The Quiet Ones, The Grand Seduction, and The Other Woman; and various adult programs. The service's barker channel continued to air previews up until midnight EDT, at which point it began to air a loop of an animated Viewers Choice bumper until eventually shutting down entirely.

Simpkin and Marshall, London, 1829. In Scotland, he is venerated as the patron saint of Clan Campbell. Alternate names He was known in Ireland as St Fintán or St Munnu. In Scotland, he was recorded as St Mun, St Munn, St Munda, St Mundas and St Mund. The name Fionn was preceded by the term of endearment 'mo', followed by \\"og\\", meaning \\"young\\". Mo-Fhionn-Og became Munno, the name by which he is popularly known. Biography =Early life= Based on certain linguistic characteristics and some historical references, the earliest life of Fintán/Munna is believed to date around the year 800.Culleton, Edward. \\"St. Munna Of Taghmon\\", Taghmon Historical Society Fintán was born of the dynasty of Niall, son of Tulchan (or Tulcan)Baring-Gould, Sabine: The lives of the saints, Vol. 12 page 558. John Hodges, London, 1877. and Feidelmia. According to the Felire of Oengus, Tulchan was a druid. Fintán may have first studied at the school of Bangor Abbey under St. Comgall,Lapa, Dmitry. \\"Venerable fintan Munnu\\", Pravoslvie and later in the school of Kilmore Deathrib. It is more certain that he studied 18 years under the abbot Sinell, son of Maynacur, at Cluain-inis in Lough Erne. St. Columba also studied at Cluain-inis under Sinell, but left prior to Munnu's arrival.Addison, James Thayer: Medieval Missionary: A Study of the Conversion of Northern Europe AD 500 to 1300 page 5. Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 14 August 2003. =Ministry in Scotland= Iona monastery Fintán arrived in Scotland in 579 A.D. He was said to be assisted by two wolves in guarding his sheep. In 597, Fintán resolved to go to Í (now called Iona) to join the monastery there under St. Columba. Just before his departure, news reached him that St. Columba had died and that St. Baithen had succeeded him. Undeterred, Fintán made the journey and applied to St. Baithen for reception into the community. Munnu responded \\"humbly\\" as St. Baithen made the customary inquiries into his background.Walsh, Thomas: History Of The Irish Hierarchy, With The Monasteries Of Each County, Biographical Notices Of The Irish Saints, Prelates, And Religious. pages 710-711. D. & J. Sadlier & Co., New York, 1854. However, when Munnu requested to be admitted as a monk, Baithen replied: > \\" I thank my God, that you are come to this place; but this you must know: > that you cannot be a monk of ours.\\" Fintan much afflicted at these words > said; \\"Is it that I am unworthy of being one?\\" \\"No\\" answered Baithen, \\"but, > although I should be very glad to keep you with me, I must obey the orders > of my predecessor Columba, who some time ago said to me in the spirit of > prophecy; Baithen remember these words of mine; immediately after my > departure from this life, a brother, who is now regulating his youthful age > by good conduct, and well versed in sacred studies, named Fintan, of the > race of MocuMoie, (74) and son of Failchan, will come to you from Ireland > (Scotia) and will supplicate to be reckoned among the monks.

A local lord in what is modern day Wexford in Leinster, named Dímma mac Áeda Croin, granted Fintán land circa 597. Munnu, in turn, granted, Dímma his personal guarantee that Dímma would gain the kingdom of heaven. Fintán at some point took Dímma's son into fosterage, and Dímma later became a cleric and was buried among the monks at the monastery.Charles-Edwards, T.M.: Early Christian Ireland pages 4,116-118. Cambridge University Press, 8 January 2001. The monastery was named Teach-munnu or \\"House of Munnu\\" and became a center of learning. Fintán was versed in scientific knowledge and gave frequent public lectures where Christian revelation was illuminated by the sciences and mathematics.Brenan, Michael John: Ecclesiastical History of Ireland from the Introduction Of Christianity Into That Country to the Year MDCCCXXIX. Vol. I. Pages 126, 161. John Coyne, Dublin, 1840. Munnu presided over 152 monks at Teach-munnu. Munnu probably founded a religious establishment at \\"Kilmund\\" (Kilmun).MacGibbon, David and Thomas Ross: The Ecclesiastical Architecture of Scotland pages 390-391. George Waterson & Sons, Edinburgh, 1896. and may have done so at Eilean Munde as well. However, it is improbable that he is founder of Clonenagh, Fintan of Clonenagh, though they are often confused. He did have an abbey in Heli (or Hele, perhaps in County Westmeath), which he and his monks forsook, giving it to Saint Cera and her companions. Saint Cera named the place, according to Fintán's instructions, after St. Telle who had given three jubilations in the plain of Miodhluachra that day.Lanigan, John: An Ecclesiastical History of Ireland, from the First Introduction of Christianity Among the Irish, to the Beginning of the Thirteenth Century, Vol. III., 2nd Edition, pages 129-131. Simpkin and Marshall, London, 1829.O'Hanlon, John: Lives of the Irish Saints, Volume VI, page 801. James Duffy and Sons, Dublin, 1873. There are several references to Munnu being a leper. Later life Toward the end of his life he opposed the adoption of the Roman method for determining the date of Easter. He strongly promoted the Irish method in opposition to Laserian. A synod convened at Magh Lene in 631 to resolve the matter, but the parties were unable to resolve the matter so a delegation was sent to Rome.Mayr-Harting, Henry: The coming of Christianity to Anglo-Saxon England, 3rd Edition pages 109-110. Pennsylvania State University Press, 1991. Munnu withdrew his opposition, and adopted the Roman system with the rest of southern Ireland. =Death and burial= He died on 21 October 635, and was buried in the cemetery at St Munn's Parish Church, Kilmun, Scotland. Veneration as a Saint His feast day is on 21 October. Fintán is associated with several tales of miracles and is recorded to have been visited by an angel.Duffy, Patrick. \\"Oct 21 – St Fintan (or Munnu) abbot of Taghmon d. 635\\", Catholic Ireland, 21 October 2012 References Category:Medieval Irish saints Category:Medieval saints of Leinster Category:Medieval Gaels Category:7th-century Irish people Category:People from County Wexford Category:Angelic visionaries Category:Burials at Kilmun Parish Church ","title":"Fintán of Taghmon"},{"id":"9476105","text":"Marvin Kurk Lee (born June 3, 1967) is a retired American professional basketball player.

The party leader is typically responsible for managing the party's relationship with the general public. As such, they will take a leading role in developing and communicating party policy, especially election platforms, to the electorate. They are also typically the public face of the respective party and the principal media contact. In many representative democracies, party leaders compete directly for high political office. It is thus typical in such states (e.g., in the Westminster system) for the party leader to seek election to the legislature, and, if elected, to simultaneously serve as the party's parliamentary leader. {} Canada In Canada, all party leaders are selected by voting during their leadership conventions. Exceptions to this process sometimes occur when Members of Parliament leave their former party to form a new party; examples of this include when Jean-François Fortin quit the Bloc Québécois to form Strength in Democracy in 2014 and when Maxime Bernier quit the Conservative Party to form the People's Party of Canada in 2018. China The leaders of Communist Parties often hold the title of General secretary (e.g. General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China) and the officeholder is usually considered the paramount leader of China. On 15 November 2012, Xi Jinping was appointed General Secretary of the Communist Party of China at the 18th Communist Party national congress. Netherlands In the Netherlands, the party leaders are the most senior politicians within the political parties in the Netherlands. The leaders outwardly act as the 'figurehead' and the main representative of the party. Within the party, they must ensure political consensus. At election time the leader is always the Lijsttrekker (top candidate) of the party list. Outside election time the leaders most often serve as Parliamentary leader of their party in the House of Representatives, In the current Third Rutte cabinet, the only leader in the cabinet is Prime Minister Mark Rutte the leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), while the leaders of the other parties in the coalition: Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) leader Sybrand van Haersma Buma, Democrats 66 (D66) leader Alexander Pechtold and Christian Union (CU) leader Gert-Jan Segers opted to remain as Parliamentary leaders in House of Representatives. Taiwan In the Republic of China, all of the political party leaders are elected by party chairmanship elections. The leader of the main ruling party Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Cho Jung-tai was elected in the 2018 DPP chairmanship by-election on 6 January 2019. The leader of the main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT) Wu Den- yih was elected in the 2017 Kuomintang chairmanship election on 20 May 2017.  United Kingdom  The method of selection of the party leader varies from party to party, though often it will involve an election involving all or part of the party membership. In some parties, only current members of the parliamentary party, or particular party office-holders, may vote; in others, such as the British Labour Party, though the entire membership is eligible to vote, some electors may have a much larger share of the vote than others (see also Superdelegate for a similar concept). If only one candidate emerges, he or she is said to have been \\"elected by acclamation\\" or \\"ratified\\" by the general membership (sometimes the term \\"anointed\\" occurs informally or in media discourse). The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, gained the position on 24 July 2019; he has served as the party leader of the Conservative Party since 23 July 2019. Jeremy Corbyn served as the party leader of the Labour Party until April 2020, when he was replaced by Sir Keir Starmer, who is now the Leader of the Opposition. United States The United States government has party leaders in the legislative branch of government. The President, currently Donald Trump, becomes the de facto leader of the party they represent once elected, and the Vice President, currently Mike Pence, likewise holds a leadership role as both the second-highest executive officer as well as being the President of the Senate. The legislative branch, otherwise known as the United States Congress, is made up of the upper chamber, the Senate, and the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, with party-elected leaders in each. The leader of the party with most the representation (sometimes called the party-in-power) in each case is known as the majority leader, whereas the leader of the opposing party with the most members is known as the minority leader. Party leaders in the United States Senate have been elected by popular vote since 1913. They currently include President of the Senate Mike Pence, President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate Chuck Grassley, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Majority Whip John Thune on the Republican side, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin on the Democratic side. The Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives are elected by their respective parties in the House by secret ballot. The Republican Party is currently represented in the House by Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise, whereas the Democratic Party is represented by Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. In the House of Representatives, the most powerful official is the House-elected Speaker, currently Nancy Pelosi of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is currently chaired by Tom Perez.  Germany  Other than in the United States, the party organizations themselves and also their representatives (such as the chairperson, who is the party leader, and other board members) play a much more prominent role in German politics than they do for example in the US or UK, where the parties are mainly represented by their members and leaders in parliament or (if applicable) government. In contrast, in Germany, although the party leaders often also hold important public offices (such as government minister or parliamentary leader), those roles are clearly separated (even by law). Consequently, it does occasionally happen that the leaders of a German party are not even members of parliament, such as Saskia Esken and Norbert Walter-Borjans, who are currently the chairpersons of the (governing) Social Democrats. This sometimes even leads to open conflicts between the party leadership, its parliamentary group and its members of government.

The chapters of the book first appeared in 1991-1992 as weekly columns in The Independent on Sunday and were eventually gathered into book form and published in 1992. The essays as they appear in the book have in many cases been expanded from their original format. Lodge focuses each chapter upon one aspect of the art of fiction, comprising some fifty topics pertaining to novels or short stories by English and American writers. Every chapter also begins with a passage from classic or modern literature that Lodge feels embodies the technique or topic at hand. Some of the topics Lodge analyzes are Beginning (the first chapter), The Intrusive Author, The Epistolary Novel, Magic Realism, Irony, symbolism, and Metafiction. Among the authors he quotes in order to illustrate his points are Jane Austen, J. D. Salinger, Henry James, Virginia Woolf, Martin Amis, F. Scott Fitzgerald and even himself. In the preface of the book, Lodge informs that this book is for the general reader but technical vocabulary has been used deliberately to educate the reader. He further adds that the alternative title of the book would have been \\"The Rhetoric of Fiction\\" had it not been used already by writer Wayne Booth.

A study of methods of constructing comics, it is a thematic sequel to McCloud's critically acclaimed books Understanding Comics and Reinventing Comics. As with its two predecessors, Making Comics is itself in comic book form, with McCloud's avatar (now \\"aged\\" 13 years since Understanding Comics) leading the reader through the pages. The book details the processes behind storytelling, character design, and other challenges specific to the medium, with illustrative examples drawn from the history of comics. Complex topics are frequently boiled down to a few principles, such as classifying cartoonists into four types, or identifying the \\"six basic emotions.\\" The book is dedicated to Will Eisner. Development McCloud drew Making Comics digitally on a Cintiq monitor. He was dealing with tendinitis in his hands during the early production of the book, and McCloud found that the monitor worked very comfortably, as it allowed him to draw with his forearm rather than with his wrist.  Publication history  McCloud thought of Making Comics as the true successor to Understanding Comics, with Reinventing Comics being more of an outlier. He felt compelled to the book as he was working on improving his own skills as a cartoonist.

They murdered four women ranging in age from 15 to 31 at their home in 1986, and attempted to murder a fifth. These crimes were referred to in the press as the Moorhouse murders, after the Birnies' address at 3 Moorhouse Street in Willagee, a suburb of Perth. David John Birnie David John Birnie was the oldest of five children. He grew up in the semi- rural suburb of Wattle Grove, Western Australia. School friends and parishioners from the Wattle Grove Baptist Church of the period remember the family as having been dysfunctional. Rumours abounded about the family's promiscuity and alcoholism, and that they engaged in incest. When Birnie's parents asked the local priest to conduct their wedding ceremony, he expressed concerns about them as individuals and as a potential couple, broadly stating that he felt theirs was a union that could never lead to any good; an unusual and seemingly unsuited pairing, the father was a man of very small stature and unattractive appearance, while the mother was known for her coarse manner, use of profanities and bad behaviour, often exchanging sexual favours with taxi drivers as payment for fares. David Birnie's school friends also commented that the family home was unkempt and filthy, and that the family never had regular meals together. His parents did not cook meals for the children. In the early 1960s, Birnie's parents decided to move the family to another Perth suburb, where David met Catherine Harrison through mutual friends. At 15, David left school to become an apprentice jockey for Eric Parnham at a nearby Ascot racecourse. During his time there, he physically harmed the horses and developed a habit of exhibitionism. One night, David broke into the room of an elderly lady where he was boarding. He was naked with stockings over his head and attempted to commit his first rape. By the time he was an adolescent, he was convicted of several crimes and was in and out of prison for misdemeanors and felonies. As an adult, he became a sex and pornography addict, and paraphiliac. He married his first wife during his early 20s and the couple had a daughter, Tanya. Tanya was 10 years old at the time of his arrest. She has never married and had no children, stating \\"I don't wanna spawn another David Birnie\\". Her surname is unknown to the media. In late 1986, David Birnie was employed at a local car wrecker's shop. For more than a year, David and Catherine had been practicing how to make their sexual fantasies of rape and murder come true, while he was weeks away from committing his first crime. Catherine Margaret Birnie Catherine Margaret Birnie (née Harrison) was born on 23 May 1951. She was two years old when her mother, Doreen, died giving birth to her brother, who died two days later. Unable to raise her, her father, Harold, sent Catherine away to live with her maternal grandparents. When she was ten, a custody dispute resulted in Harold regaining sole custody of Catherine. At the age of 12, she met David Birnie, and by the age of 14 she was in a relationship with him. Harold begged Catherine on several occasions to leave David, due to the fact that she was often getting in trouble with the local police. But his disapproval of their relationship only strengthened their union. Her time in prison throughout her adolescent years offered Catherine a chance to break away from David. Encouraged by a parole officer, Catherine began working for the McLaughlin family as a housekeeper. She married Donald McLaughlin on her 21st birthday. She and McLaughlin had seven children; their firstborn, a son, was struck and killed by a car in infancy. In 1985 she left her husband and six children and went to live with David. The couple was never legally married, but Catherine changed her surname by deed poll to Birnie. Crimes Over a period of five weeks, the Birnies abducted five women, aged between 15 and 31. All of the victims, except for one, were raped and murdered. The sole exception was their final victim, who escaped the day after her abduction and led police to the Birnie house, thus ending their crime spree. Victims =Mary Neilson= 22-year-old Mary Neilson was studying psychology at the University of Western Australia and working part- time in a delicatessen when she met David Birnie at the spare parts yard he worked at. David offered to sell her cheap tyres for her car, and subsequently gave her his phone number. On 6 October 1986, she went to the Birnies' house. She was gagged, chained to the bed and raped by David while Catherine observed. She was taken to Gleneagles National Park near Albany Highway in Bedfordale where she was raped again and strangled with a nylon cord. He then stabbed her thinking that it would speed up the decomposition as he \\"read that in a book somewhere\\", and they buried her in a shallow grave. She would have received her degree for psychology from the university one year after her murder. =Susannah Candy= Two weeks after the murder of Mary Neilson, they abducted 15-year-old Susannah Candy as she hitchhiked along Stirling Highway in Claremont, Australia. She was an outstanding student at Hollywood Senior High School, and lived at home with her parents and siblings in Nedlands, Australia. Her father is one of the top ophthalmic surgeons in Western Australia. After she went missing, the Birnies forced her to send letters to her family to assure them that she was all right. But the family feared for her life. The Birnies had been cruising for hours looking for a victim when they spotted Candy. Once she entered the car she was held at knife point while her hands were tied together. She was taken back to the Willagee house where she was gagged, chained to the bed and raped. After Birnie had finished raping the girl, Catherine Birnie got into the bed with them. She now knew that this turned David on. When they had both assaulted her, Birnie tried to strangle the girl with the nylon cord, but she became hysterical. The Birnies forced sleeping pills down her throat to calm her down. Once Candy was asleep, David put the cord around her neck and told Catherine to prove her undying love for him by murdering the girl. Catherine complied with the demand and killed Candy while David watched. When asked later why she did it, Catherine said: \\"Because I wanted to see how strong I was within my inner self. I didn't feel a thing. It was like I expected. I was prepared to follow him to the end of the earth and do anything to see that his desires were satisfied. She was a female. Females hurt and destroy males.\\" They buried Candy near the grave of Mary Neilson in the State Forest. = Noelene Patterson= On 1 November, they saw 31-year-old Noelene Patterson standing beside her car on the Canning Highway; she had run out of fuel while on her way home from her job as bar manager at the Nedlands Golf Club. Once inside the car, she had a knife held to her throat, was tied up and told not to move. She was taken back to Moorhouse Street where David repeatedly raped her after she was gagged and chained to the bed. The Birnies originally decided to murder her that same night, but David kept her prisoner in the house for three days and there were signs that he had developed an emotional attachment to Patterson. Catherine quickly became jealous and made an ultimatum: David would have to kill Patterson or Catherine would kill herself. He immediately forced an overdose of sleeping pills down Patterson's throat and strangled her while she slept. They took her body to the forest, but buried it away from the others. Catherine reportedly got great pleasure from throwing sand on Patterson's face. =Denise Brown= On 5 November, the Birnies abducted 21-year-old Denise Brown as she was waiting for a bus on Stirling Highway. She accepted a ride from them, and at knifepoint, was taken to the house in Willagee, chained to the bed and raped. The following afternoon she was taken to the Wanneroo pine plantation. In the seclusion of the forest, David Birnie raped Brown in the car while the couple waited for darkness. After they dragged Brown from the car, David Birnie raped her again and stabbed Brown in the neck. Convinced that the girl was dead, they dug a shallow grave and laid her body in it, but Brown sat up in the grave. David Birnie then grabbed an axe, struck her twice in the head, and buried her body in the grave. = Kate Moir = Seventeen-year-old Kate Moir was abducted at knifepoint after accepting a ride from the Birnies. Moir later stated that she asked them if they intended to kill or rape her, and was informed \\"we'll only rape you if you're good\\". She was forced to dance for them, and slept in the couple's bed while handcuffed to David. Moir was their final abductee and the only victim to survive. After abducting her, David held a knife to her throat, and forced her to ring her mother. Moir assured her mother that she had too much to drink and was staying at a friend's house, hoping her mother would catch on the ruse and call the friend, knowing she was not a drinker. She escaped the day after her capture. After David went to work, Catherine went to the door to carry out a drug deal, and forgot to chain Moir to the bed. She escaped by climbing through a closed window by breaking its lock; however, she hit her head on the concrete. After knocking on various neighbours' doors, she jumped a gate and was attacked by a dog. She managed to flee, and ran into a vacuum cleaner shop on 10 November 1986. She later described herself as \\"hysterical. I'm barefoot wearing my black leggings, a black singlet, knickers...\\". She informed the shop owner that she had been raped. When the police arrived, she said she had been abducted at knifepoint by a couple who had taken her back to their house and raped her. The police were initially sceptical of her story, but 22-year-old Constable Laura Hancock believed her from the outset, due to the amount of detail she provided, including their address and telephone number. The Birnies had given themselves aliases, but Moir had read David's name on a medicine bottle. Moir stated they had watched the film Rocky on VHS, and described a drawing she had concealed in the house as proof of her presence. Subsequently, the police found her drawing in the home, as well as the VHS copy of Rocky in the Birnie's VCR. David and Catherine were arrested, and during their interviews, they gave conflicting information; Catherine denied ever meeting Moir, while David insisted Moir had come to their house voluntarily to engage in consensual sex. Detective Sergeant Vince Katich convinced David to confess, and reveal where they had buried the bodies so that they could be dug up before dark; David revealed there were four graves. = Other possible victims = There is speculation that the Birnies were responsible for the disappearance of Cheryl Renwick in May 1986, and Barbara Western in June 1986. It has been suggested that David was responsible for the disappearance of Lisa Marie Mott in 1980; however, his first wife accounted for his whereabouts on the day Mott disappeared. Trial and sentencing When sent to trial, David Birnie pleaded guilty to four counts of murder and one count each of abduction and rape. When asked why he had pleaded guilty, he gestured toward the victims' families and said, \\"It's the least I could do.\\" He was sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment. After being found sane enough to stand trial, Catherine Birnie was also sentenced to four terms of life imprisonment by the Supreme Court of Western Australia; under law at the time, both were required to serve 20 years before being eligible for parole. Imprisonment Initially David was held at the maximum security Fremantle Prison, but he was soon moved to solitary confinement to keep him from coming to harm from other prisoners. The original death row cells were converted for him and he stayed there until the prison was closed in 1990. The cell can occasionally be viewed on the True Crime Tour held daily at Fremantle Prison. While incarcerated, the Birnies exchanged more than 2,600 letters, but were not allowed any other form of contact. David Birnie was found dead in his cell at Casuarina Prison on 7 October 2005 at 4:30am (WST). He was 54 years old. An inquest found that he had hanged himself from an air vent using a length of cord. Various factors led to his suicide; a failure to provide him with his anti-depressants had exacerbated his depression, his computer had been confiscated and he was suspected of sexually assaulting another prisoner. He was described by a former prison officer as a 'model prisoner' who looked after injured animals. Catherine was not allowed to attend his funeral. Catherine Birnie is imprisoned in Bandyup Women's Prison. Since being incarcerated she has worked as a prison librarian and appeared in a prison production of Nunsense. In 2007, her parole application was rejected and the then Attorney-General of Western Australia, Jim McGinty, said that her release was unlikely while he remained in office. Her case was to be reviewed again in January 2010; however, on 14 March 2009, new Western Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter, following requests from the victims' families, determined she would stay in jail for life. This decision makes her the third Australian woman (after Katherine Knight and Patricia Byers) to have her papers marked \\"never to be released\\". Her appeal of this decision was turned down in March 2010 by Porter. Her fourth bid for parole was declined in 2016. In 2016, the Birnies' final victim—who survived—began a campaign to end Western Australian laws that automatically put convicts up for parole every three years. Moir has stated Birnie has never even applied for parole. In 2017, Birnie‘s youngest son, Peter, called for her execution. He has stated that his association with Birnie has resulted in his being assaulted. He supports Moir's campaign. Media The case was included in Season 1, Episode 6 (\\"The Moorhouse Horrors\\") of Crime Investigation Australia, first aired 2005. The case was covered by Casefile True Crime Podcast on 27 August 2016. On 9 November 2017, the case was discussed by Georgia Hardstark in an episode of the podcast My Favorite Murder. The case was detailed on episode 75 of the True Crime All the Time podcast on 22 April 2018. The 2016 Australian film Hounds of Love is based on several true murders, but most closely resembles the Moorhouse Murders.

The story was allegedly inspired by the discovery of unusually warm water in Antarctica in 1947. It starred Jock Mahoney and Shirley Patterson and was directed by Virgil W. Vogel. The film is notable for its low-budget special effects, which include men in dinosaur suits, puppets and monitor lizards standing in for dinosaurs. William Reynolds recalled the studio spent so much money on their mechanical dinosaur that they could not afford to shoot the film in color as they first planned.There's Always Tomorrow Plot A small crew led by Commander Harold Roberts and reporter Maggie Hathaway are on an expedition into Antarctica for the United States Navy. During a helicopter flight, they are called back to their ship via radio because of an unexpected storm approaching. At first they try to fly around the storm, but low on fuel, they fly into the storm, where they almost collide in mid-air with a man-sized pterosaur. Their rotor breaks and unable to stay in the air they start to descend, and are surprised when they end up landing well below sea-level in a warm volcanic crater. Inside, they discover a steamy tropical jungle populated by living dinosaurs, giant flesh-eating plants, and fresh human footprints. The crew encounter many dangers and perils in the jungle in a fight for survival. The crew meet Hunter, the lone survivor of a plane crash from the 1947 expedition. He has learned to survive in this land with the aid of a conch that drives off the animals and by raiding the dinosaurs' nests. He offers the remains of his airplane to repair the helicopter, but only if the crew agree to leave Maggie with him. The crew refuses, but they also know that after 25 days their ship will have to leave before the Antarctic winter sets in. Unsuccessful in finding the remains of the plane, hidden by Hunter, the crew debate leaving Maggie, or forcing the information out of Hunter by torture. Commander Roberts refuses to sink to either low. Maggie is later attacked by an Elasmosaurus, but Hunter rescues her. After a fight and learning that the crew refuse to torture him for the location of the plane, Hunter gives them the map to its location. After repairing the helicopter, the crew take off in a hurry as a Tyrannosaurus rex attacks their base. They fly to pick up Maggie, who is with Hunter at the time. Hunter is ambushed by the Elasmosaurus, and the crew come to his rescue. They fly out of the lost world with him. Once clear of the crater, the crew are able to communicate again by radio with their ship; however, the helicopter runs out of fuel and crashes into the ocean before it reaches the vessel. The crew are rescued, and once safely on the ship Harold and Maggie declare their love for one another. The animals featured in this film include a Tyrannosaurus, Elasmosaurus, Stegosaurus live acted by monitor lizards (which would make them megalania), a pair of Pterosaurs and a giant flesh-consuming plant. The mammal found by the crew then later eaten by the carnivorous plant is referred to as a tarsier but is actually a loris. Cast *Jock Mahoney as Cmndr.

He was also an elected as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and later, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly. Campbell was the second son of Robert Campbell and born at Campbell's Wharf, The Rocks in Sydney, Australia. In 1810, his parents sent him to Pimlico, London, England to be educated and he returned in 1819. In 1827 Campbell joined his father's company Campbell and Co. One of his first duties was in January 1828 to travel to England on company business on the barque Lady Blackwood (John Dibbs, Master),The Oriental Herald and Journal of General Literature, Volume 22, p.384 returning to Sydney in March 1830, again on the Lady Blackwood. In 1829 (in England) he became active in the anti- transportation campaign. In the early 1830s, he refused to sit on a jury that included emancipists in order to draw attention to this cause and as a result became the leader of the campaign. In 1835 he had married Annie Sophia, daughter of Edward Riley (1784-1825), a merchant and pastoralist in the Sydney area. In response to an 1846 parliamentary committee recommendation that transportation (which had ceased in 1840) be recommenced, Campbell organized a protest meeting. A petition in opposition to transportation was signed by some 6800 persons was presented to the Legislative Council and the British Government. Nevertheless, the convict ship, the Hashemy, arrived in 1849, but further meetings chaired by Campbell prevented more convicts being sent to Sydney. In 1851 Campbell was elected to the Legislative Council representing the City of Sydney. In 1856 he was elected to the first Legislative Assembly. He was Colonial Treasurer from August to October 1856 and from January 1858 until his death. He became ill and died at his father's property at Duntroon in what is now Canberra. His daughter was married to Edward Wolstenholme Ward.

The album consisted of thirteen finished but unreleased Beatles songs. A planned single containing two of the tracks from Sessions – \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\", backed with an alternative version of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" – was also left unissued. The idea was resurrected in 1995 as the greatly expanded three-volume double CDs The Beatles Anthology with an accompanying six-hour documentary. Background When the Beatles' contract with EMI had expired in 1976, the record company began to take stock of the band's back catalogue and look at the hundreds of hours of unreleased recordings stored in the Abbey Road Studio vaults. Over the next couple of years several compilation albums of previously released material would be issued (Rock 'n' Roll Music, Love Songs, The Beatles Ballads) and a live album of their Hollywood Bowl performances. An album of unreleased studio recordings was also considered, with a few attempts being abandoned. In the early 1980s, while needing a task to distract him from his cancer treatment, Abbey Road Studios house engineer John Barrett was assigned the task of listening to and logging the studio's collection of multi-tracks and master tapes of the group. This research unearthed more previously unknown recordings. Some of these recordings were remixed for inclusion in the 1983 multi-media tour of Abbey Road Studios, titled The Beatles at Abbey Road. A year after the Abbey Road show, in the summer of 1984, EMI began work on a compilation album of previously unreleased material. Former Beatles engineer Geoff Emerick was hired to remix and re-edit the material to a commercial standard. At the time, the album went under the in-house code name \\"Mary Jane\\" and the working titles Boots and One-Two-Three-Four before Sessions was settled upon. The original release date of Sessions was to be November 1984, but EMI did not want to clash with Paul McCartney's Give My Regards to Broad Street soundtrack, so the compilation was cancelled. According to reports, McCartney later objected to the release of Sessions in its then current form, while the other surviving members and John Lennon's estate objected to the album completely. As a result, Sessions was cancelled indefinitely and the tracks did not appear on any official release until the Anthology project in the mid 1990s. Cover art There were two proposed artworks for the cover, including one colour collage cover and one with a black and white photo of the group in the courtyard of Abbey Road Studios. In 2014, a complete slick set for the black and white cover was auctioned on eBay by Beatles collector Perry Cox; the bidding stopped at US $2,910.00, which failed to meet the reserve. This was the complete artwork, including the front cover, the back cover, and the inner sleeve. This was as far as production ever reached before the entire project was cancelled by EMI Records and no album was pressed for it. Final proposed track listing * An early version of the album had \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\\" edited into two parts and cross-fading at the beginning of the album into \\"Come and Get It\\" and at the end of the album from \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", the latter of which was cut from the album and planned to be released as a B-side. * Some bootleg compact disc editions include \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" as a bonus track.https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles- Sessions/release/4206480https://www.discogs.com/Beatles- Sessions/release/5005400https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles- Sessions/release/4138982https://www.discogs.com/The-Beatles- Sessions/release/4494681 Notes Category:Albums produced by George Martin Category:Albums recorded at Abbey Road Studios Category:The Beatles compilation albums Category:Unreleased albums ","title":"Sessions (Beatles album)"},{"id":"9476214","text":"Domingo Perez may refer to: Places *Domingo Pérez, Granada, a municipality of Granada, Spain *Domingo Pérez, Toledo, a municipality of Toledo province, Spain People *Domingo González Pérez (1842–1927), Costa Rican politician *Domingo Pérez Minik (1903–1989), Spanish writer *Domingo Pérez (footballer) (born 1936), Uruguayan soccer player Perez, Domingo ru:Доминго-Перес ","title":"Domingo Pérez"},{"id":"9476260","text":"A takeover is the purchase of one company by another.

His career spanned 22 years, thirteen of which were spent at Tranmere Rovers. He played for thirteen different clubs and made over 500 league appearances before his retirement in 2004. Career =Playing career= Early career, Manchester City and loans Born in Manchester, Nixon began his career in August 1982 at Non-League club Curzon Ashton from Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester. On 10 December 1983, he signed for Manchester City for a transfer fee of £1,000. He made 84 appearances in five years at the club, and was sent out on loan five times. And it was with four of those loan spells in the 1986–87 season that he achieved the rare distinction of playing for a club in all four divisions of the Football League in a single season. Nixon walked into Manchester City's stadium, Maine Road and asked for a trial. In August 1986 he went on loan to Wolverhampton Wanderers, who were then in the Fourth Division, making sixteen league appearances. This was followed by short spells on loan at Bradford City, who were then in the Second Division, in November 1986, and Southampton, who were then in the First Division, in December 1986. The following month he went out on loan again, this time to Carlisle United, who were then in the Third Division, where he made sixteen league appearances. Nixon's final loan move while at Manchester City came in March 1988, when he was sent to Tranmere Rovers, for whom he made eight league appearances. Tranmere Rovers Nixon signed for Tranmere Rovers permanently for a fee of £60,000 on 26 July 1988. In nine years at Prenton Park Nixon made 432 appearances, including 333 league appearances, and was with the club during their rise from the Fourth Division to the First Division play-offs in 1992–93. In the 1988–89 season he kept 25 clean sheets, which still stands as a club record for the most clean sheets in a season. He was also a part of the Tranmere team that won the Associate Members' Cup in 1989–90, beating Bristol Rovers 2–1 in the final at Wembley with goals by forwards Ian Muir and Jim Steel. In 1996, towards the end of his time at Tranmere, Nixon found himself again being sent out on loan three times. In January, he joined Reading; the following month he was loaned to Blackpool, for whom he made 20 league appearances; and in September he spent a second loan spell at Bradford City, making twelve league appearances. Stockport County, Wigan Athletic and back to Tranmere Rovers On 27 August 1997, Nixon was signed by Stockport County for £100,000. In 19 months at Edgeley Park, he made 42 league appearances, and he was also sent on loan again, this time to Wigan Athletic in August 1998, before signing for them permanently in March 1999 on a free transfer. However, his time at Wigan was short-lived, and on 4 July he was back at Tranmere Rovers for a third time, on another free transfer, where he stayed for a further four years, becoming a part-time goalkeeping coach. After focussing on coaching rather than playing, Nixon spent one short loan spell at Kidderminster Harriers in October 2001, for whom he kept three clean sheets in three games. On his return, he signed non-contract terms with Tranmere. On 8 August 2002, he again signed as a non- contract player with the club to provide cover for Keith Welch, who Tranmere had just signed. The 2002–03 season was his testimonial season and his testimonial match was played at Prenton Park on 6 August against the club he supported as a youngster, and for whom he first played professionally – Manchester City. When he played in goal against Crewe Alexandra on 21 September 2002, Nixon, at 39 years and 352 days old, became the oldest player to ever play for the club: his record was subsequently broken by Ian Goodison. Nixon's final club was Sheffield Wednesday, for whom he signed on a free transfer on 1 July 2003, and where he was used as a goalkeeping coach, making one league appearance – on 27 September 2003 against Grimsby Town. His spell with the club was spent coaching three days a week, and spending two days back at Tranmere Rovers coaching. =Coaching= While he was still playing, Nixon had started working towards gaining his goalkeeping coach licence, and in August 2004 he became a full-time goalkeeping coach with Tranmere Rovers. Nixon now holds both a UEFA goalkeeping coaching A licence and a UEFA football coaching A licence. On 10 February 2006, Nixon gave up his coaching responsibilities with Tranmere Rovers because of knee problems and also to attend a personal-fitness coaching course before opening a health and fitness studio in Prenton, before moving to Dubai, where he worked as a personal fitness trainer. On 5 February 2007, Nixon was honoured for his outstanding service to Tranmere Rovers as the winner of the Dave Russell Award at the annual Sports Personality Awards in Liverpool. Nixon has also written a regular column for the Liverpool Echo newspaper. In October 2008, Nixon was appointed goalkeeping coach at Conference North club Fleetwood Town by manager Micky Mellon. The two were teammates at Tranmere Rovers and during Nixon's spell on loan at Blackpool in 1996. He left the club in May 2011 by mutual consent. In 2012, Nixon released his autobiography Big Hands, Big Heart. He continues to play charity games for his former clubs, coach youngsters at a local leisure centre and provide match commentary and analysis for the media. In Summer 2012 he gave an exclusive interview to SKY TV's Holiday and Cruise Channel talking about his life and career. In February 2013 he opened a new sports centre for youngsters on the Wirral.Eric Nixon Agent On 17 May 2013, Nixon was named new goalkeeping coach with Chesterfield F.C. joining ex- teammate Paul Cook who now manages the Spireites. Both previously played together at Tranmere and Stockport in the late nineties. In summer 2017, Nixon was reunited with Mellon, becoming the Tranmere Rovers goalkeeping coach.

In 1803, in separate laboratories, Martin Heinrich Klaproth in one, and Berzelius and Hisinger in another, the element Cerium was discovered, which was named after the newly discovered asteroid, Ceres. It was discovered nearly simultaneously by both laboratories, though it was later shown that Berzelius and Hisinger's cerium was actually a mixture of cerium, lanthanum and so-called didymium.

The fighting took place in modern day southern Greece, the Aegean Sea and Asia Minor. The war was the consequence of a \\"cold war\\" between both powers, which had started in 196 BC. In this period Romans and Seleucids had tried to settle spheres of influence by making alliances with the small Greek city states. The fighting ended with a clear Roman victory. In the Treaty of Apamea the Seleucids were forced to give up Asia Minor, which fell to Roman allies. As a main result of the war the Roman Republic gained hegemony over Greek city states and Asia Minor, and became the only remaining major power around the Mediterranean Sea. Prelude Greece and the Aegean on the eve of the Second Macedonian War (200 BC) Antiochus III the Great, the Seleucid king, first became involved with Greece when he signed an alliance with King Philip V of Macedon in 203 BC.Green, Alexander to Actium: The Historical Evolution of the Hellenistic Age, 304 The treaty stated that Antiochus and Philip would help each other conquer the lands of the young Ptolemaic pharaoh, Ptolemy V. In 200 BC, Rome first became involved in the affairs of Greece, when two of its allies, Pergamum and Rhodes, who had been fighting Philip in the Cretan War, appealed to the Romans for help.Livy 31.14 In response to this appeal the Romans sent an army to Greece and attacked Macedon. The Second Macedonian War lasted until 196 BC, and it effectively ended when the Romans and their allies, including the Aetolian League, defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae. The treaty's terms forced Philip to pay a war indemnity and become a Roman ally while Rome occupied some areas of Greece. Meanwhile, Antiochus was fighting the armies of Ptolemy in Coele-Syria in the Fifth Syrian War (201–195 BC). Antiochus' army crushed the Egyptian army at the Battle of Panium in 201 BC, and by 198 BC, Coele-Syria was in Antiochus' hands. Antiochus then concentrated on raiding Ptolemaic possessions in Cilicia, Lycia and Caria.Livy 33.19 While attacking Ptolemy's possessions in Asia Minor, Antiochus sent a fleet to occupy Ptolemy's coastal cities in the area as well as to support Philip. Rhodes, a Roman ally and the strongest naval power in the area became alarmed and sent envoys to Antiochus saying that they would have to oppose him if his fleet passed Chelidonae in Cilicia because they didn't want Philip to receive aid.Livy 33.20 Antiochus ignored the threat and kept proceeding with his naval movements, but the Rhodians did not act because they had heard that Philip had been defeated at Cynoscephalae and was no longer a threat. Peace was established in 195 BC with the marriage of Antiochus' daughter, Cleopatra, to Ptolemy. Antiochus' hands were now clear of problems in Asia and he now turned his eyes towards Europe.  Outbreak of the war  Silver coin of Antiochus III Meanwhile, Hannibal, the Carthaginian general who had fought against Rome in the Second Punic War, fled from Carthage to Tyre, and from there he sought refuge at Antiochus' court in Ephesus where the King was deciding what actions to take against Rome.Livy 34.49 Because of the continued Roman influence in Greece, the Aetolians, in spite of the philo-Hellenic consul Titus Quinctius Flamininus having just declared Greece \\"free\\", now garrisoned Chalcis and Demetrias, which the Romans themselves had argued were key to Macedonia's domination of Greece, and became anti-Roman. They also resented how the Romans had prevented them from reincorporating Echinus and Pharsalus, which had formerly been part of the League, at the end of the Second Macedonian War.Livy 34.23 In 195 BC, when the Romans decided to invade Sparta, the Aetolians, wanting the Romans to leave Greece, offered to deal with Sparta. However, the Achaean League, not wanting Aetolia's power to grow, refused.Livy 34.24 The modern historian Erich Gruen has suggested that the Romans may have used the war as an excuse to station a few legions in Greece in order to prevent the Spartans and the Aetolian League from joining the Seleucid King Antiochus III if he invaded Greece.Gruen, The Hellenistic World and the Coming of Rome, 450 Having defeated Sparta in 195 BC, the Roman legions under Flamininus left Greece the next year. In 192 BC, a weakened Sparta appealed to the Aetolians for military assistance.Smith The Aetolians responded to this request by sending a unit of 1,000 cavalry.Livy 35.35 However, after they got there, this force assassinated Nabis, Sparta's last independent ruler, and tried to gain control of Sparta, only to be defeated.  The military conflict  thumbright400pxThe Aegean world at the outbreak of the war in 192 BC. Building on anti-Roman sentiment in Greece, particularly among the city-states of the Aetolian League, Antiochus III led an army across the Hellespont planning to \\"liberate\\" it. Antiochus and the Aetolian league failed to gain the support of Philip V of Macedon and the Achaean League. The Romans responded to the invasion by sending an army to Greece which defeated Antiochus' army at Thermopylae. This defeat proved crushing, and Antiochus was forced to retreat from Greece. The Romans under the command of Scipio Asiaticus followed him across the Aegean. The combined Roman-Rhodian fleet defeated the Seleucid fleet commanded by Hannibal at the Battle of the Eurymedon and at the Battle of Myonessus. After some fighting in Asia Minor, the Seleucids fought against the armies of Rome and Pergamum at Magnesia. The Roman-Pergamese army won the battle, and Antiochus was forced to retreat.  The Peace of Apamea  thumbright400pxTerritorial changes resulting from the Peace of Apamea. The battle was disastrous for the Seleucids, and Antiochus was forced to come to terms. Amongst the terms of the Treaty of Apamea, Antiochus had to pay 15,000 talents (450 tonnes/990,000 pounds) of silver as a war indemnity, and he was forced to abandon his territory west and north of the Taurus Mountains. Rhodes gained control over Caria and Lycia, while the Pergamese gained northern Lycia and all of Antiochus' other territories in Asia Minor.

Reputed to be the first factory custom motorcycle,Mitchel, D. \\"Harley-Davidson Chronicle - An American Original\\" p. 234 Publications International Limited, 1997 it originated Harley-Davidson's FX series of motorcycles by mating Sportster components, most notably the front end, with the chassis of their larger big twin motorcycles. Super Glide models from 1991 to 2017 were based on the Dyna Glide chassis which has a wider variety of front ends and trim levels, and for a time filled the intermediate niche between the smallest and largest Harley-Davidson models; the Dyna platform has since been discontinued for the 2018 model year in favor of the new Softail frame, with some models from the Dyna nameplate being carried over to the Softail line. History =1971 FX Super Glide= 1971 FX Super Glide From 1934 to 1970, with the exception of the Servi-Car, there have been two distinct lines of V-Twin Harley-Davidson motorcycles, the small twins and the big twins. However, individual bikers would sometimes customize bikes by changing parts around or cutting and rewelding frames and other components to suit their tastes. Harley-Davidson styling director Willie G. Davidson was aware of this phenomenon and decided to design a motorcycle for production that would have the look of the custom bikes. To accomplish this, he started with the frame and rear suspension, but not the electric starter, from the FLH Electra Glide, to which he then mated the smaller telescopic forks from the XLH Sportster. This combination was referred to as the FX chassis, where \\"FX\\" meant \\"Factory Experimental\\", The drivetrain and engine accessories were from the FLH, the front headlights and brakes were from the XLH. This use of a mixture of FL and XL parts has also been used to explain the FX designation. To complete the Super Glide, he added buckhorn handlebars and a \\"boattail\\" tail/fender unit similar to those being used on the XLH Sportster. The production FX Super Glide was released in 1971 to a lukewarm reception. Particularly not well received was the \\"boattail\\", which also proved to be unpopular on the Sportsters that had it. Sales of both models improved when less radical rear styling was made available.Mitchel, D. \\"Motorcycle Classics\\" p. 150 Publications International Limited, 1995 =Variations of the FX Super Glide= Shovelhead FX variant In 1974, the FX was joined by the FXE, a version of the Super Glide with an electric starter. Both versions also got an exclusive one-piece tank instead of the Fat Bob tank used by the FL. In 1977, the FXS Low Rider was introduced. The Low Rider had alloy wheels front and rear, two disc brakes on the front wheel, extended forks with a 32° rake, and a 26\\" seat height.DudeWorld H-D LowRider History Unlike the Super Glide, the Low Rider was an instant hit; outselling all other Harley-Davidson models in its first full year of production.Mitchel, D. \\"Motorcycle Classics\\" p. 192 Publications International Limited, 1995 All three FX models returned to using Fat Bob tanks, but with a special center divider that included a tachometer. A 1977 Harley-Davidson Confederate Edition of the Super Glide that had commemorative paint and tank and fender decals was produced but in such low volume numbers - only 228 units - as to make it one of the rarest of the company's motorcycles.Google BooksHarley-Davidson Confederate Edition, Motorcycle Classics The base, kickstart-only FX was discontinued in 1979. In that year, the FXEF Fat Bob was introduced. The following year would bring the FXB Sturgis, an all-black Low Rider with primary and secondary belt drives, and the FXWG Wide Glide, a Low Rider with wide forks and a flame pattern painted on the tank. In 1983, the Low Rider was converted from chain drive to belt drive and given the designation FXSB, at which point the FXB was discontinued. In the same year, the FXDG Disc Glide was introduced. This model had a disc-type rear wheel instead of the wire-spoked wheel of the Super Glide or the solid-spoked wheel of the Low Rider. The FXE Super Glide was discontinued in 1985, with the FXEF Fat Bob becoming the base model. The 1985 FXEF was the first and last FXEF to have the Evo motor along with being the last year for the 4sp and chain drive. In 1986, all FX-based bikes except the Wide Glide were supplanted by FXR-based bikes. The Wide Glide was discontinued the following year. =FXR= The FXR Super Glide II was introduced in 1982 and sold alongside the existing FX models. The FXR chassis was essentially an FLT Tour Glide chassis with slightly bigger diameter frame tubes and a more conventional design around the steering head. As such, it had a rubber-mounted engine and a five-speed transmission, as opposed to the solid mounting and four-speed transmission of the original FX chassis. The FXR range was expanded in the same year by the introduction of the FXRS Low Glide, which was the FXR equivalent of the FXSB Low Rider, and next year with the FXRT Sport Glide in 1983, a Super Glide variant with a fairing and saddlebags. Upon the discontinuation of the corresponding FX-based models, the FXR Super Glide II became the FXR Super Glide and the FXRS Low Glide became the FXRS Low Rider. The Wide Glide was discontinued because the FXR frame was not suitable for the wide forks. The 1984 Disc Glide as it was known was a very rare motorcycle. It had the first Chrome Package: chrome rocker boxes, nose cone, and primary cover. It was called the FXRSDG. Dyna 100th Anniversary H-D Dyna Low Rider (FXDL), 2003 2005 Dyna Super Glide Custom Controls of a 2008 Harley-Davidson FXD Superglide Dyna Wideglide TwinCam 88 Design work began on the replacement for the FXR chassis shortly after the first FXR bikes were sold. The Dyna chassis was introduced in 1991 with a limited-production FXDB Sturgis model.Auto Lemon History of the 1991 FXDB Sturgis The engine mounting system was changed from three rubber mounts to two, resulting in poorer vibration control, but speedier production on the assembly line. The Sturgis was followed in 1992 by the limited-edition FXDB Daytona. Also introduced in 1992 was the FXDC Dyna Glide Custom. Apart from the paint scheme, the Dyna Glide Custom was virtually identical to the Daytona. Dyna Customs were all painted black and silver, and the early models had a silver powder coat on the frame. Later production units had a black frame. In 1993 the faired and bagged FXRT Sport Glide was discontinued and the FXRS Low Rider was displaced by the FXDL Dyna Low Rider, although the FXR, FXLR, FXRS-Conv Convertible and the FXRS-SP Low Rider Sport continued to be sold. The FXDWG Dyna Wide Glide was introduced in the same year. The Low Rider Sport was discontinued in 1994, and the Low Rider was discontinued after the 2009 model year. Between the 1991 introduction of the Dyna chassis and the end of the 1994 model year, all Dyna models had a 32° rake. In 1995 the FXD Dyna Super Glide and the FXDS-Conv Dyna Glide Convertible were introduced. These Dynas had a 28° rake and replaced the FXR Super Glide and the FXLR Low Rider Custom, which were the last FXR models in regular production. The FXDX Super Glide Sport was introduced in 1999, with improved suspension components and triple disc brakes. The FXDX-T Super Glide T-Sport, with a fork mounted fairing and improved detachable saddlebags, replaced the FXDS-Conv Dyna Convertible in 2001, and was discontinued in 2003. The FXDC returned to the line in 2005 as the Super Glide Custom.Hot Bike - 2005 Harley-Davidson Line-Up In 2006, a new Dyna chassis was introduced along with a new six-speed transmission. In the same year new models were the FXDBI Street Bob (a minimal, single seat Dyna Glide motorcycle available in the new 'denim' (matte) black color) and the limited edition FXDI35 35th Anniversary Super Glide (colored to resemble the original white 1971 Super Glide). The FXDX Super Glide Sport was discontinued.Motorcycle Cruiser 2006 Harley- Davidson Line In 2007, the Twin Cam 88 engine was replaced by the fuel- injected 1584 cc Twin Cam 96 engine across the entire Harley-Davidson Big Twin lineup, including the FXD series. The 'I' model designator was dropped for all models, since all Big Twins from then on had fuel injection. The FXDF Fat Bob was introduced in 2008. In the same year, the FXDWG Wide Glide was sold as a limited edition 105th Anniversary model before being retired, re-emerging in 2010 with a different (bobber) rear treatment. 2010 also saw the discontinuation of the FXD base model (replaced by the FXDB) and the loss of the FXDL Low Rider. 2012 saw some Dynas obtain the TC103 engine, available in the FXDF and FXDWG models as well as the new FLD Switchback, a sport-tourer. A revised version of the FXDL Low Rider returned in mid 2014, and replaced the FXDC Super Glide Custom in the line up. Midway through 2016 Harley-Davidson released a special edition FXDLS Dyna Low Rider S with the Screaming Eagle 110 cubic-inch engine, dual front disks, and electronic cruise control. http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/2016/01/article/2016-harley-davidson-low-rider- s-first-look/ Harley-Davidson discontinued the Dyna platform in 2017 for the 2018 model year, having been replaced by a completely-redesigned Softail chassis; some of the existing models previously released by the company under the Dyna nameplate have since been carried over to the new Softail line.

Early life Ernõ \\"Ernie\\" Könnyű was born May 17, 1937, in Tamási, Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Tamási, Hungary) to poet, professor and cartographer Leslie Konnyu and his wife, Elizabeth, a bookkeeper and owner of a home secretarial school, and is the eldest of his two late siblings Gabriela (Helen) and Zoltan (Joseph). In 1949 the 12-year-old Konnyu, together with his family, immigrated to the United States from a post-World War II refugee camp in Ampflwang, Austria. He attended parochial and public schools in Jefferson City and St. Louis, Missouri. He attended University of Maryland, College Park and received his Bachelor of Science degree from Ohio State University in 1965. Konnyu served in the United States Air Force as a captain from 1959 to 1969 and as a major in the Air Force Reserve from 1970 to 1981. In 1959, he married Lillian Muenks of Loose Creek, Missouri. Military service Konnyu joined the U.S. Air Force in 1959 as an enlisted medic, served at the U.S. Air Force Hospital in Wiesbaden, Germany, with a final rank of Staff Sergeant, and attended night school at the University of Maryland's Wiesbaden campus, then got an Air Force scholarship to attend Ohio State University, where he majored in accounting. He received his BS in Business Administration in 1965. He was admitted to the Air Force Officer Training School at Lackland AFB, Texas, where he was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant. From 1965 to 1969 he served at Nellis AFB, Nevada, as a senior auditor with a final rank of captain. He spent 11 years in the U.S. Air Force Reserve ending with a rank of major until he received an honorable discharge retiring from the Air Force in 1997. Business career Konnyu's business career began in 1969 as Controller at Valley View Investments in North Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1970 he moved to Arcadia, California, where he was internal audit supervisor at Avon Products, Pasadena. Konnyu, a Certified Internal Auditor, served as corporate director of internal audit at National Semiconductor Corp. in Santa Clara, California, from 1974 to 1980. Konnyu continued his community service work with the Junior Chamber of Commerce first in Arcadia, then in San Jose, California. As a result of his extensive service to the community the Arcadia Jaycees recommended Ernie Konnyu for a lifetime Senatorship in Junior Chamber International which he received in 1973. ^5 Political career =California State Assembly= Konny was elected an Assemblyman from 1980 through 1986 representing California's 22nd Assembly District (western and southern Santa Clara County). He served as Chairman for Policy of the Assembly Republican Caucus and vice-chair of the Assembly Human Services Committee on welfare. His most notable achievement was the California workfare law, A.B. 2580, that required able bodied welfare recipients without small children to work or train in exchange for their welfare check and benefits. =Congressional career= Konnyu was elected in 1986 to the U.S. House of Representatives gaining 55% of the vote in the district previously served by Republican Congressman Ed Zschau (who tried unsuccessfully to gain a Senate seat) and Republican Congressman Pete McCloskey. Konnyu's principal legislative success was H.R. 1720, The Family Support Act of 1988 reforming the Nation's welfare system by creating, among other things, work incentives for welfare recipients. =Sexual Harassment= Not even one year into his first term, Congressman Konnyu caused waves when three separate accusations of sexual harassment were raised, and responding to it in terminology that made it even worse. In one instance, he told a staffer in a private meeting to wear \\"high heels and frilly\\" blouses, and then \\"asked her to stand up and turn around so he could 'see what you look like'\\". Another time, he commented on where a staffer chose to wear her name tag, stating that it called attention to her breasts. The staffer was then fired after refusing to attend any more private meetings with the Congressman. In addition, he alienated fellow Republicans, including higher-ranked ones. His predecessor, Republican Ed Zschau, started looking to recruit opponents to take on Konnyu in the next primary, and even Zschau's predecessor, Republican Pete McCloskey, called Konnyu an embarrassment. Konnyu lost the next Republican primary to Republican Tom Campbell, who went on to serve for two terms. Business and retirement Konnyu resumed his business career in 1989 investing in a printing business then in 1998 in a tax consulting service. After 22 years he sold his business and retired in 2011. He and his wife of 57 years reside in San Jose, California, and stay active with local, state and national professional, charity and political groups. He ran unsuccessfully for Santa Clara County Assessor in 1994, losing the nonpartisan race to Democrat Larry Stone by 181,406 votes (52.51%) to 164,045 (47.49%).https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=800298 In 2004, he won the Republican primary for California's 24th State Assembly districthttps://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58114 but lost the general election to Democratic incumbent Rebecca Cohn by 94,152 votes (59.42%) to 55,956 (35.32%).https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=72762 He ran brief and abortive campaigns to challenge Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom in 2014, to succeed retiring Democratic U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer in 2016, against Democratic U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein in 2018 and against Democratic Congresswoman Katie Porter in 2020.

They were one of the most successful Schlager groups of all time, and have been constantly recording and releasing new music since their self-titled debut album was released in 1970. They have released 45 albums, 5 of which have gone platinum, 24 gold. They have won a Goldene Stimmgabel (one of the biggest German music awards) in 1988, 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2004.  Band history  The group was formed in 1964 in Knittlingen, Baden-Württemberg consisting of Manfred Durban, Claus Backhaus, Franz Halmich, Manfred Mössner, Manfred Hehl and Hans Springer. They called themselves the \\"Dancing Band,\\" and one year later renamed themselves the \\"Dancing Show Band.\\" Hans Springer was soon replaced by Bernd Hengst. In 1967 Olaf Malolepski replaced Manfred Hehl. In 1969 the group released their first single \\"Weine nicht, kleine Eva\\" under their new name, Die Flippers. The song enjoyed great success on Schlager radio. Their second single, also from their debut album, entitled \\"Nur mit dir allein\\" was released, but did not match the success of \\"Weine nicht, kleine Eva\\". Not long after, the group released their third single, \\"Sha La La, I Love You\\" which was also a great success, and is now considered one of their trademark songs. In the following years the group released numerous albums and quickly became arguably the biggest Schlager group of the early 1970s. In 1973, the group started working with producer Jean Frankfurter. In 1974, Claus Backhaus left the group. Towards the end of the 1970s, the group's record sales began to drop, but the attendance for concerts remained high. In 1979 Roland Bausert left the group, and Albin Bucher (who would later become famous touring solo as Albin Berger) replaced him as the lead singer. In the same year Mick Hannes and Walter Gerke became the new production team, in an attempt to regain the success the group enjoyed in years past. The first half of the 1980s had passed, and the group was still unable to regain the success of the early 1970s. In 1985, lead Roland Bausert rejoined the group, but 1986 he exited the group once again. A new keyboardist, Harry Authenrieth, also joined the group but left shortly after Roland Bausert's exit. The band continued as a trio, consisting of Bernd Hengst, Olaf Malolepski and Manfred Durban. This lineup would remain the same until the bands retirement in 2011. The band teamed up with producers Heinz Rupprich and Uwe Busse for the album Auf rote Rosen fallen Tränen. One year after in 1986, the group released their fifteenth album Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt. This played out to be their comeback album, and it was the group's first gold record. It also contained the massive hit \\"Die rote Sonne von Barbados\\". With this song, they appeared on many German television programs, including the ZDF-Hitparade. The album's title track was also a great success, and received a large amount of airplay on Schlager radio stations. In 1988, the group went on tour for the first time. Since that year, they have been on yearly tours. Their biggest concert was at the Westfalenhalle in Dortmund, Germany before an audience of 17,000. In 1994, the German television network ZDF aired the first Flippers special. This led to several more throughout the rest of the 1990s and the 21st century. In 2004, they celebrated their 35th anniversary with a greatest hits compilation entitled 35 Jahre - Ein Leben für die Zärtlichkeit and the biggest tour of their career, during which they played in some of the biggest stadiums in Germany. Over the course of the tour, over 150,000 people were in attendance. They performed their last concert in Manheim on 19 March 2011 and gave their final TV performance on 9 April 2011. Founding member Manfred Durban died on 20 October 2016 at the age of 74.

Events Jean-Baptiste was born in 1746 in Lons-le-Saunier, France, where he worked as a tanner. In 1771 after being successfully treated for scrofula (tuberculosis of the neck) at Bicêtre Hospital, Pussin was recruited as a member of the hospital staff.

Pussin advocated a relatively humane treatment, engaged in psychologically-based work with patients, and maintained records regarding his empirical observations and therapeutic proposals. In 1793 he was visited at the Bicêtre by physician Philippe Pinel (1745-1826), who had just started work at the hospital. Pinel was impressed by Pussin's approach and the positive results he had achieved. In 1797, after Pinel had left, Pussin instituted a reform that permanently banned the use of all chains to restrain patients. Straitjackets continued to be used, however. Not long after Pinel was assigned to the Salpêtrière Hospital, he arranged to have Pussin move there with him, as a special assistant. Chains were then banned there also. In 1801 Pinel published his Treatise on Insanity, which describes their work. In 1809, in the second edition of the Treatise on Insanity, Pinel reports Pussin’s initiative to ban the use of chains. Jean Baptiste Pussin died in 1811. Clinical approach In Pinel's 1801 Treatise on Insanity, he acknowledges his indebtedness to Jean-Baptiste and Marguerite Pussin and their pioneering contributions to psychiatry. Pinel states that Jean-Baptiste Pussin often defined the psychological approach to be used, because \\"he lived amongst the insane night and day, studied their ways, their character, and their tastes, the course of their derangements, knows when to be benevolent, when to be an imposing figure...\\", allowing him to know the individuals more than a physician could by making his rounds.Gerard, D.L. (1998) Chiarugi and Pinel considered: Soul's brain/person's mind Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences. Volume 33 Issue 4, Pages 381 - 403 Pinel describes a case where Jean-Baptiste Pussin \\"perceived the beginning of a favorable change; wishing to hasten the recovery, he began a series of conversations with the patient in his room, coming gradually to the subject of his delusion. “If you are king,” he said to him, “how come you cannot bring your detention to an end, and why are you mixed up with all these lunatics?” Returning on subsequent days, he continued to talk with him, in benevolent and friendly fashion; he made him see, little by little, the ridiculousness of his pretensions, showed him another patient who had been long convinced of his supreme power and thereby became an object of derision. Shaken by these remarks, he began to question his title of sovereign, and began to recognize his ideas as chimera\\". Pinel admires the skill of Marguerite Pussin, who was able to alter \\"the convictions of a man whose life was endangered by his delusional and infuriated insistence on abstaining from any food. Fearlessly she hops and dances, makes joking remarks, until he smiles, and in his lighter mood he accepts nourishment from her\\".

The cannon was seized by pro-slavery forces in 1856 and fired during the Sacking of Lawrence in 1856. The cannon was damaged in 1896 when it was loaded with clay and straw and fired. The Liberty Arsenal, known by Federal authorities as the Missouri DepotHistory of Clay and Platte Counties, p. 195 was a United States Army arsenal at Liberty, Missouri in Clay County, Missouri. The depot was seized twice by Southern partisans, once during the Kansas troubles in 1855, and again shortly after the outbreak of the American Civil War.History of Clay & Platte Counties, pp. 174–175, pp. 195–197 It was located generally west of the junction of Missouri Route 291 and old 210 Highway.Borgedalen, Liberty Tribune Construction of the arsenal On July 2, 1836, President Andrew Jackson signed a bill authorizing construction of an arsenal on the western frontier of Missouri, and on June 30, 1837, the Federal government obtained a deed to ten acres of land near Liberty. Construction of the arms depot was completed in 1839 and on September 30, 1841 the War Department reported that the arsenal consisted of one building for officers' quarters, one building for men's quarters, one storehouse, one magazine, three workshops, one armory, two gun sheds and two laboratories. At that time the whole amount, expended for the Liberty Arsenal from its first establishment amounted to $26,435.96.Shoemaker, Sikeston Herald Bleeding Kansas During the period when the free or slave state status of Kansas was still an open question, pro-slavery residents of Clay County frequently crossed the border to vote in Kansas territorial elections and participated in armed incursions to oppose Free State elements in the territory. On December 4, 1855 during the \\"Wakarusa War\\", a company of over 100 armed Clay County volunteers, led by Judge James Turner Vance Thompson of Clay County, MissouriCongressional Series of United States Public Documents, Volume 869, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1856, page 60 and Missouri Maj. Ebenezer Price, seized the arsenal. The custodian of the facility, U.S. Maj. Luther Leonard and his six employees were placed under arrest while many of the arms and equipment were removed.History of Clay & Platte Counties, pp. 174–175 The arsenal at that time contained: three brass six pounder cannon, 55 rifles, 67 cavalry sabres, 100 dragoon pistols, 20 Colt revolvers, accoutrements, equipment, and ammunition.History of Clay & Platte Counties, pp. 174 On December 10, 1855, Captain William N. R. Beall of the 1st U.S. Cavalry moved to the arsenal with a cavalry company to prevent another raid and to recover what had already been taken. The pro-slavery forces had concluded their foray against Lawrence, Kansas and the Wakarusa War had ended with a treaty a few days before. Therefore, after Capt. Beall discussed the matter of the arsenal weapons with prominent local citizens, most of the material was returned.History of Clay & Platte Counties, pp. 175-176 American Civil War After states began seceding from the Union, the Missouri Constitutional Convention of 1861 voted, 98–1, on March 21, 1861, to stay in the Union but not to supply men or money to either side. On April 12, 1861, the Civil War officially began with the firing on Fort Sumter. Ardent secessionists in western Missouri again eyed the Liberty Arsenal. A large company of Clay County militia led by Colonel Henry Lewis Routt and a Jackson County militia company captained by John H. McMurray of Independence, about 200 men in all, forced their way into the arsenal on April 20, 1861. The depot's caretaker, Major Nathaniel Grant, with only two employees, could do nothing but protest the forcible takeover.History of Clay and Platte Counties, pp. 196–197 The event has sometimes been called the \\"Missouri Fort Sumter.\\" This left the St. Louis Arsenal as the only other Federal military arsenal in the entire state. The Southern sympathizers captured three six-pounder brass cannons and carriages; 12 unmounted six-pounder iron guns; one three-pounder iron gun; two battery wagons; five caissons; two forges, artillery equipment and several hundred rounds of artillery ammunition (mostly solid shot and canister.) They also took 1,180 percussion muskets, 243 percussion rifles, 121 rifle carbines, 923 percussion pistols, 419 cavalry sabers, 39 cavalry swords, 20 cavalry and artillery musketoons, 400,000 cartridges, 1,000 pounds of cannon powder, 9,900 pounds of musket powder, and 1,800 pounds of rifle powder.History of Clay and Platte Counties, pp. 197 While substantial, this pales compared to the 37,000 muskets and rifles believed to have been kept at St. Louis.Solving the Mystery of the Arsenal Guns by Randy R. McGuire, PhD - civilwarstlouis.com A portion of the secessionist force held the depot for a week as they removed the materials. Some was taken to Routt's home near what is now William Jewell College. His ice-house was converted into an armoury for distributing weapons to Missouri Militiamen and later to the Missouri State Guard. The brass field pieces became Capt. Henry Guibor's State Guard battery. The kegs of powder were hidden throughout the countryside. A portion of the arms were shipped upriver to the charge of St. Joseph mayor M. Jeff Thompson. Because of this and other activities, Routt was captured in March 1862, tried for treason, and sentenced to hang, but was pardoned in April by Lincoln citing Missouri Governor Gamble's amnesty program.Robinson, Cecelia, Kearney Courier, April 20, 2011Harris, Christopher, Liberty Tribune, May 4, 2011 Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon, fearing that the much larger St. Louis Arsenal could also fall, secured the St. Louis Arsenal on April 29 and in May began sending most of its munitions safely to Illinois, out of the reach of Missouri's secessionists. Capt. O.P. Moss, a Mexican War veteran and leader of the Unionist Liberty Home Guards (formed only a few days later, on April 24) characterized the seizure of the arsenal this way: \\"Col. Routt had no more right to capture the Liberty Arsenal, with its government arms and munitions, than John Brown had to seize the one at Harper's Ferry.\\"History of Clay and Platte Counties, pp. 201–202 Closure and historic marker Maj. Grant continued as custodian of the depot until it was sold in 1869 (via a July 25, 1868 act of Congress.)Shoemaker, Sikeston Herald On October 6, 2012, an historic marker was placed at the highway intersection near the site once occupied by the arsenal.

The Snoqualmie Valley Regional Trail is a rail trail in King County, Washington, United States. The trail follows a portion of the former alignment of the Milwaukee Road, which was constructed in 1911 and abandoned in 1973. The trail begins at Rattlesnake Lake outside of North Bend and ends at McCormick Park in Duvall. History The Milwaukee Road constructed its Snoqualmie Valley branch in 1911, and began passenger service on April 21, 1912. Route The trail parallels the Cedar Falls Road before it heads east passing Rainbow Lake and down through the Boxley Creek drainage where a trestle bridge crosses a tributary of Boxley Creek. The trail intersects the eastern edge of Riverbend subdivision and crosses South Fork of the Snoqualmie River and then makes its way under I-90 and crosses North Bend Way and makes its way through North Bend and out through Mt. Si Golf Course to Reinig Bridge at SE Reinig Road. Rough distance : 9.79 miles. Reinig Bridge crosses the Snoqualmie River and goes down a short flight of 15 steps to Meadowbrook Way Se near the intersection of SE Reinig Road. Two routes connect to the railroad grade, one via 396th Dr SE, the other on Mill Pond Road. From Tokul Creek Road the trail heads west (the trail unofficially continues in an unimproved state for a quarter-mile east of Tokul Creek Road before hitting a gate at a property boundary). A mile west on the trail from Tokul Creek Road the trail crosses Tokul Creek Trestle, where deep below runs Tokul Creek gorge.

MC5  After dropping out of the fine arts program at Wayne State University, Davis became the bassist for the MC5 in 1964, replacing original bassist Pat Burrows when singer Rob Tyner and guitarist Wayne Kramer decided that they liked Davis's style and wanted him in the band. He played on the band's three original albums, including their debut Kick Out the Jams, and remained in the group until 1972. In 1975-6, Davis spent time in Kentucky's Lexington Federal Prison on a drug charge, where he was unexpectedly reunited with Wayne Kramer.  Destroy All Monsters  Upon his release from prison, Davis joined the Ann Arbor-based art noise band Destroy All Monsters at the urging of friend Ron Asheton, of The Stooges. Davis spent seven years with Destroy All Monsters, penning the underground punk hits \\"Nobody Knows\\", \\"Meet the Creeper\\", \\"Little Boyfriend\\", \\"Rocking The Cradle\\" and \\"Fast City\\" among others. The band recorded and released on Cherry Red Records, toured the U.K., and then broke up.  Blood Orange and MC5 reunion  After Destroy All Monsters, Davis moved to Tucson, Arizona where he played in Blood Orange with drummer Cory Barnes. When plans for Blood Orange to depart for a European tour were shelved indefinitely, Davis began playing with Rich Hopkins and Luminarios, the latter taking him back into the studio to record several albums for Germany's Blue Rose Records. In the spring of 2003, Davis reunited with fellow surviving members Wayne Kramer and Dennis Thompson to play a show at London's 100 Club as part of a promotion for an MC5 inspired line of apparel for Levi Strauss Vintage Clothing. This spawned a 200 city world tour and a trip back into the studio to write new songs.  Music education project  Following a serious motorcycle crash on a Los Angeles freeway in May 2006, Davis along with his wife Angela Davis, launched a non-profit organization called The Music Is Revolution Foundation to support music education in public schools. Volunteers Jake Cavaliere (The Lords of Altamont), Handsome Dick Manitoba (The Dictators), Steve Aoki (Dim Mak Records/Kid Millionaire), Pro- Skater Corey Duffel, Pennywise bassist Randy Bradbury and Obey Giant's Shepard Fairey work alongside Davis to raise funds and public awareness about the ability of music education to increase cognitive ability and test scores, reduce absenteeism and drop-out rates and to inspire a new generation of future voters to learn about other cultures and other times, develop greater understanding of the world around them, and express themselves through music. Music Producer Davis produced and performed on The Mother's Anger's self- titled debut album. He also produced Dollhouse's debut album, Rock N Soul Circus. Art career After the MC5 self-destructed in the early 1970s, Davis continued exploration as a visual artist while serving time at the Lexington Federal Correction Institution for a narcotics violation. During this period, he was tasked with creating oversized abstract paintings for permanent display in the prison’s Visitor Center and administrative offices. Several years of immersion in life in the desert southwest and world travels with various rock bands left Davis with the inspiration and desire to return to his roots as a painter, studying art along the way at The Armory Center For The Arts in Pasadena, California, the University of Oregon, in Eugene, Oregon, and at Portland Community College in Portland, Oregon and Butte Community College/California State University, Chico in Chico, California. In 2006 he collaborated with artist Chris Kro, pro skateboarder Corey Duffel, and Foundation Skateboards to design a commemorative line of skateboard decks and T-shirts. In 2007, he collaborated with OBEY’s Shepard Fairey on a limited line of MC5:OBEY merchandise. In 2009, his painting \\"White Panther/Big World\\" appeared on the Cleopatra Records release MC5: The Very Best of MC5. In 2011, his painting titled \\"Black To Comm Sk8r Boys\\" appeared as the cover art for the Easy Action Records multi-media audio/DVD release from the 2009 sold-out performance by British rock superstars Primal Scream and the reunited surviving members of the MC5 at the Royal Festival Hall. This piece inspired a series of four additional paintings, as well as a run of limited edition prints, all featuring the Sk8tr Boys, this time against iconic Detroit backdrops. Death On February 17, 2012, Davis died of liver failure at the age of 68. He was survived by his wife, a daughter, and a son.

Formed in 1987 by Alvin Tan, The Necessary Stage was established with its own mission to create challenging, indigenous and innovative theatre that touches the heart and mind. The Necessary Stage is a recipient of the National Arts Council's Major Grant FY2014-2016, and is also the organiser of the annual M1 Singapore Fringe Festival. It is currently located at the Marine Parade Community Building. Main season For its main season, The Necessary Stage produces an average of four plays a year at its Black Box and at other venues. These include plays for the Singapore Arts Festival. The plays are original, mostly devised pieces created in a collaborative process that is based on research, improvisation before scripting, and input from all members of the production. This process has produced many important works which were not only popular successes but also critically acclaimed, including: * Boxing Day: The Tsunami Project (2005), * Top Or Bottom (2004), * Sing Song (2004), * koan (2003), * BOTE: The Beginning Of the End (2002), * godeatgod (2002 & 2004), * Close – in my face (2002), * ABUSE SUXXX!!!

In June 2006, The Necessary Stage presented Mobile, a creative collaboration involving talents from Japan, The Philippines, Singapore and Thailand, as part of the Singapore Arts Festival. Mobile also toured to Kuala Lumpur following its world premiere in Singapore for a 3-day run at The Actors Studio in Bangsar, as well as at Setagaya Public Theatres in Tokyo in March 2007. 2007 sees The Necessary Stage celebrating its 20th anniversary. As part of its celebration, the company staged two works, the first being a seminal piece first staged in 1993, Off Centre. This production was presented at Esplanade Theatre Studio as part of The Studios Season in May 2007 and received accolades and warm responses from the audience and press. The play has been selected by the Ministry of Education (Singapore) as part of the GCE 'O' and 'N' level literature syllabus from 2007 onwards. In November 2007, The Necessary Stage presented another a brand new play that dealt with the issue of living, dying and the pain in between. Good People looks at the relationship between 3 people – Miguel, the new Medical Director trying to run a tight ship; Yati, a jaded nurse making the best of a ‘dead-end’ job; and Radha, the terminally-ill patient addicted to marijuana to relieve her pain. Moving, humorous and evocative, Good People looks at urgent contemporary issues through the test of personal relationships. The play received critical acclaim and popular acclaim in Singapore, and travelled to Kuala Lumpur in May 2008. It was nominated in 7 categories of the 2008 Life! Theatre Awards and won the Best Original Script award. In October/November 2008, The Necessary Stage staged Gemuk Girls, a bold and darkly humorous look at family politics and the politics of the day. Gemuk Girls was a three-hander, featuring a mother-daughter duo Kartini (a loud and overbearing hippie mother) and Juliana (a straitlaced young woman on the threshold of entering politics). One day, they receive shocking news about Kartini's father who had been arrested and detained in the 1960s. The play dealt with the controversial issue of ex- political detainees and detention without trial, but went beyond the political realm to look at how it impacted personal and family life and history. It received critical acclaim from various presses, and toured to Kuala Lumpur in December 2008. Gemuk Girls also swept the Best Script, Production of the Year and Best Actor (for Najib Soiman's portrayal of the ex-political detainee) at the 2009 Life! Theatre Awards. It was successfully restaged with the original cast in November 2011 with a sold-out run. October was a main season production staged by The Necessary Stage in 2012, and it was a re-working of the company's previous work of the same title in 1996. It looks at elderly residents of a precinct undergoing upgrading, and their relationship with one another and a young property agent eager to have them sell their homes. In 2013, The Necessary Stage embarked on an exciting intercultural production entitled Mobile 2: Flat Cities. On the cusp of Japan's surrender during World War II, a Japanese general suffers a stroke and is tended to by a Malay gardener. As they spar, having heated debates about the war, the present is revealed: a Japanese man in a relationship with an Indian woman in Kuala Lumpur; his ex-wife coming to grips with an astrologer's predictions; their son, studying in the United States and confronted by his classmates about Japan's past. A multilingual production featuring artists from Singapore, Malaysia and Japan, Mobile II: Flat Cities cast the spotlight on stories of personal, social and universal struggles across Asian cities. It was well received and travelled to Kuala Lumpur for performances after the run in Singapore. The Necessary Stage explored the use of social media in theatre through Poor Thing in February 2014, a work that throws the spotlight on road rage in Singapore. The sold-out run of the production received rave reviews from all quarters. In the same year, the company created a challenging new intercultural and interdisciplinary production entitled Gitanjali [I feel the earth move] in September 2014. Most recently in 2015, The Necessary Stage presented Pioneer (Girls) Generation, featuring an intergenerational cast, with a plot revolving around a posh senior retirement home in Singapore. International work The Necessary Stage is committed to international exchange and networking between Singapore and other countries. Such exchange is done through staging the company's plays abroad, inviting foreign works to be presented by the company in Singapore, as well as through dialogues, workshops and training opportunities. To date, the company has performed in Berlin, Birmingham, Busan, Cairo, Dublin, Glasgow, Hong Kong, Khabarovsk, Kuala Lumpur, London, Macau, Melbourne, New Delhi, Rijeka, Seoul, Sibiu, Sziget, Taipei and Tokyo. Resident Playwright Haresh Sharma also participated in a collaboration among Southeast Asian theatres, spearheaded by Setagaya Public Theatre in Tokyo, Japan, which culminated in a production in 2005. The Necessary Stage's Resident Playwright Haresh Sharma was one of four international playwrights commissioned by the Glasgow-based 7:84 Theatre Company to write a play on the theme of Separation and Reconciliation (as part of the celebration of the 300th Anniversary of the Act of Union between Scotland and England and the Scottish Elections). Sharma's play, Eclipse, is about the Indian/Pakistan partition as told by a young Singaporean man who is making a trip to his father's homeland in Pakistan. The play saw its world premiere on 11 April 2007, at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, and subsequently toured to various theatres in Scotland, including the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow. Eclipse made its way back to Singapore for its Asian premiere as a full-length play as part of the 2008 M1 Singapore Fringe Festival. The Virgin Labfest in Manila is a festival of new plays by emerging and well-known playwrights, directors and actors. It held its third edition from 28 June to 8 July 2007 at the Cultural Centre of the Philippines, and featured Haresh Sharma's Lizard as part of its International Night line-up, alongside a triple-bill featuring two other plays by Thai and Japanese playwrights. Lizard, originally presented by The Necessary Stage in 1996, tells the story of a dysfunctional family involving a mother, son and maid. For the Manila staging, it was directed by Nicolas Pichay, and showcased a surreal and inertly violent depiction of a Singaporean household whose scheming, double-dealing, and at times cruel transactions negotiated with each other makes for a rather intense sala-set drama. The theatre company's recent main season productions, Good People, Gemuk Girls, Model Citizens, Mobile 2: Flat Cities and Best Of toured to Kuala Lumpur in May 2008, December 2008, January 2011, September 2013 and January 2014 respectively. Best Of was also featured at Georgetown Arts Festival as part of Causeway EXchange in Penang, Malaysia in July 2013. The Necessary Stage collaborated with Tony Yap Company from Australia in 2009 for a brand new piece entitled Past Caring. In 2010, The Necessary Stage collaborated with Theatre KnAM from Russia and presented Sofaman in Singapore and Khabarovsk. Another production entitled Crossings – a creative multidisciplinary collaboration with Croatian theatre company TRAFIK – was presented as part of Esplanade Theatre's The Studios in August 2012. The play then travelled to National Theatre, Rijeka, Croatia for stagings in September 2012. Most recently, The Necessary Stage worked with Japanese, Malaysian and Singapore artists to create Mobile 2: Flat Cities (see above). The production premiered in Singapore in August 2013 before touring to The Actors Studio @ KuAsh Theatre in Kuala Lumpur in September the same year. Theatre For Youth and Community The Theatre For Youth Branch was set up in 1992 and renamed Theatre For Youth and Community (TFYC) in 2001. TFYC's principal interest is in theatre work with and for young people and different communities in Singapore. This includes presenting short plays during school assemblies, interactive Theatre-In-Education programmes, workshops, and process-based drama programmes that focus on personal development. Since 1992, TFYC has performed to more than 800,000 students, piloted drama programmes for school curriculum, and worked with numerous non-governmental organisations and voluntary welfare organisations. It was also responsible for the successful Marine Parade Theatre Festival (2000), FamFest (2001), The Necessary Community Festival (2001), M1 Youth Connection (1997–2003) and M1 Theatre Connect (2004). Over a 3-year period beginning from April 2008, The Necessary Stage began the Theatre For Seniors Ensemble (TFS), geared towards training the participants in various aspects of theatre-making and arts administration. This project is supported by the Council for 3rd Age, Kwan Im Thong Hood Cho Temple and the National Arts Council. TFS successfully staged their end-of- year production Encore I, Encore II: Heartland! Heartland!, Encore III: Family Knots and Encore IV: Love Life to full houses in March 2009, 2010, 2011 and June 2013 respectively. Currently, a spin-off group from TFS, now known as Theatre for Seniors Interest Group is exploring ways to continue their training and engagement with the public through performances and related events. The Necessary Stage also trained selected seniors as facilitators, so that they can work with the community on a wider level to engage other seniors in arts activities. TFS was also commissioned to stage a successful production entities Old Flames as part of the 2013 My Queenstown Festival. In January 2014, TFS was featured at the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2014: Art & the People, in Singapore's first seniors forum theatre production entitled Take Me or Leave Me!. One of the two plays in the production, Void Deck, is to be restaged as part of Passion Arts Festival 2014. The Necessary Stage has also worked with various non-governmental organisations, statutory boards and government ministries to present works dealing with specific issues to the public. Alzheimer's Diseases Association had commissioned the Company to create a full-length performance dealing with Alzheimer's diseases, Don't Forget to Remember Me, which was presented at Jubilee Hall over 4 performances. Health Promotion Board has previously commissioned the Company to create and present Play Safe (a forum theatre piece on safe sex) as well as a scaled down version of Don't Forget to Remember Me in various community spaces. The Necessary Stage was commissioned by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to present a skit on child abuse entitled Sweet Dreams, targeted at primary school students. The Necessary Stage has also worked with Centre for Biomedical Ethics on a play entitled Future Perfect, dealing with ethical issues in biomedical research, targeted at secondary school students. This skit is also restaged in 2013 (February/March and July/August 2013). The company was also commissioned by Hospice Care Association to create a production entitled Don't Know, Don't Care, promoting caregiving amongst the young. This production toured schools in July 2012, and was restaged in May and July 2013, with a film adaptation that was recently completed. It will be restaged once again in July 2014. Most recently, The Necessary Stage worked on a commission by Singapore Maritime Foundation entitled The Project, focusing on career opportunities in the maritime industries. \\"The Project\\" toured to schools in the first half of 2013 and 2014. Publications The Necessary Stage has produced several publications. Still Building (1994), published by EPB, is a compilation of three plays by the company's Resident Playwright Haresh Sharma. Other early published work by Haresh include This Chord and Others (1999) – a compilation of six plays published by Minerva, and Off Centre (2000), published by Ethos Books. In 1997, the company published 9 Lives – 10 Years of Singapore Theatre, a landmark book and the first of its kind featuring essays on Singapore theatre, commissioned by The Necessary Stage. Ask Not: The Necessary Stage In Singapore Theatre, a collection of essays on examining the social, political, economic and artistic aspects of theatre-making in Singapore from the perspective of The Necessary Stage, was published by Times Editions in 2004. In 2007, Off Centre was selected by the Ministry of Education in Singapore as a literature text for the GCE ‘O’ and ‘N’ levels syllabi, and was republished by the company the same year. In August 2007, a new volume of Interlogue: Studies in Singapore Literature, was published with a focus on the works of Haresh Sharma. The publication, written by Prof David Birch and edited by A/P Kirpal Singh, was an extensive investigation into Sharma's development as a writer. In 2010, The Necessary Stage published a new anthology of Haresh's plays entitled Trilogy, including the scripts and production notes of its three award-winning works, Fundamentally Happy, Good People and Gemuk Girls. In 2011, two collections of short plays by Haresh Sharma entitled Shorts 1 and Shorts 2 were published by The Necessary Stage. The script of Those Who Can't, Teach, which was restaged as part of the 2010 Singapore Arts Festival, as well as Model Citizens, have also been published by Epigram Books. A collection of plays entitled Plays for Schools with plays targeted at educators and students was published in late 2012. The Necessary Stage's recent collection of plays is entitled Don’t Forget to Remember Me, dealing with medical issues and launched at the Singapore Writers Festival in November 2013. In May 2014, The Necessary Stage launched the publication Best Of. The play was staged at the M1 Singapore Fringe Festival 2014 and 2014 to rave reviews, and also received popular and critical acclaim during its runs in Penang at the Georgetown Arts Festival 2013 as well as Kuala Lumpur in 2014. Following that in the same year, another publication Eclipse was launched; this production had previously been presented in Singapore and Scotland. The Triangle Project The Triangle Project was started in 1992 with the aim of providing opportunities for the less privileged to watch theatre. The Necessary Stage matches donors and charities with the former buying tickets to our productions for the beneficiaries. This scheme has proven to be very successful and numerous beneficiaries of Voluntary Welfare Organisations have experienced theatre as a result.

Around age 18, he left Liberia for the United States to achieve an education and arrived at Taylor University in December 1891. There is now a residence hall at Taylor University bearing his name. He died in 1893 from complications of a respiratory infection. Morris's life has been the subject of five novels, over a dozen biographies, a 1954 film, and a 1988 documentary. Taylor University has named numerous buildings, scholarships, and a society in his honor. His story helped to inspire others to go to Africa to preach the gospel. Early life Samuel Kaboo Morris was born in Liberia, in 1873. Little is recorded of his early life. Kaboo was a prince in the Kru tribe. When he was 14 years old, his tribe,(the Kru) was attacked by the Grebos. Kaboo was captured and used as a \\"pawn\\". The Grebos forced the Kru to pay each month in order to be able to see Kaboo and ensure his safety. Kaboo's father, the chief, came each time but the Grebos consistently refused what he brought. Finally, the Kru could bring no more and Kaboo began to be tortured every day. During one of his beatings, there was a flash of light and a voice told Kaboo to flee. The ropes which bound him fell off and his sick body gained strength. He fled to the jungle, where he wandered for days living off snails and mangos until he came to a coffee plantation. Kaboo began to work for the owner of the plantation, and a former slave who had come to Liberia. While living on the plantation, he began to attend church where he was taught by missionaries. After hearing the Biblical narrative of Saul's conversion, where a man encountered a blinding light, Kaboo converted to Christianity. He was baptized, and took the name Samuel Morris, after a mentor of one of the missionaries. Morris was motivated to travel to America as he learned more about the christian God whom he had encountered. The missionaries told him about Stephen Merritt, a christian teacher in New York. Morris declared \\"I am going to New York.\\" After waiting at the docks for several days, Morris eventually found passage on a ship to New York in exchange for work. On board, he was abused and beaten again, but he endured with patience and forgiveness. The crew saw Morris pray frequently, even during dangerous storms. Attracted to the profound peace he had, the crew were attracted to the tentants of Christianity. Many converted, and by the end of the five-month journey across the Atlantic, the crew was radically different. Life in the States In the States, Morris found Stephen Merritt. Impressed by his anointing and confidence, Merritt invited Morris to stay at his house. In a time where racism against Africans was widely accepted, the community which encountered Morris instead saw that God was working in him and created the Samuel Morris Missionary Society to collect funds to send Morris to college so he could study the Bible. He enrolled at Taylor University, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. While at Taylor University, Morris encouraged many people in their faith. Students frequently asked to pray with him. People from around the world would come to hear him speak. He was known to spend hours in prayer with God, from late at night to early in the morning. Newspapers printed stories of \\"the boy from Africa who was charging Fort Wayne with the electric power of God\\". Morris was an active member of Berry Street Methodist Episcopal Church and regularly attended East Wayne Street Methodist Episcopal Church. Death Morris desired to be educated in Biblical literature in order to return to Liberia as a missionary. However, late in 1892, he suffered a case of pneumonia that would eventually end his life. Samuel is reported to have said, “It is not my work [to go to Liberia]. It is His. I have finished my job. He will send others better than I to do the work in Africa.” On May 12, 1893, at approximately 20 years of age, Samuel Morris, died. Fellow students served as pallbearers at his funeral. After his funeral, many of them said they felt led to go to Africa to be missionaries in Samuel's place. At the time, it was customary to bury blacks in the \\"Negro\\" section of the cemetery. However, Samuel's body was later moved to the center of the cemetery, linking blacks and whites in death like he did in life. A memorial is placed at his gravesite that reads: :Samuel Morris :1873-1893 :Prince Kaboo :Native of West Africa :Famous Christian Mystic :Apostle of Simple Faith :Exponent of the Spirit-filled life :Student at Taylor University 1892-3 :Fort Wayne, now located at Upland, :Indiana.

The first three colognes that were created – Dirt, Grass and Tomato – were launched at New York department stores, Bergdorf Goodman and Henri Bendel, in 1996.

Product description Demeter fragrances are cologne concentration (2-4% perfume oil within the carrier of alcohol), as opposed to more commonly seen fragrance formats, such as \\"eau de toilette\\" or \\"eau de parfum\\", which have a higher ratio of perfume oil to alcohol and may therefore last longer on the skin of the wearer. Some of the better known fragrances are Angel Food, Baby Powder, Carrot, Cosmopolitan Cocktail, Leather, Paperback, Play-Doh (created in 2006 to mark Play-Doh's 50th anniversary), Riding crop, Sushi, Pipe Tobacco, Turpentine, Snow, Lime, and Golden Delicious Apple. The fragrances in the line can be combined and layered together so that wearers can create their own fragrances. Besides its cologne sprays, Demeter Fragrance Library makes other products scented with the same fragrances, including body lotions, shower gels, exfoliant scrubs and room sprays.

The ship was named and christened in Venice by her godmother Lindsey Wilkerson, a former patient and current researcher at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital.http://www.travelweekly.com/Cruise-Travel/St-Jude-employee-named- Carnival-Magic-godmother Wilkerson Carnival Magic was laid down on 20 November 2008, launched from her drydock on 27 August 2010 and completed on 29 April 2011. Sea trials were undertaken between 17–20 March 2011. She has 1,845 passenger cabins and 746 crew cabins, and can carry over 6,000 persons in total. The lifeboat configuration of Carnival Magic differs from that of her sister ship, , in that Carnival Magic has 18 double-size lifeboats, while Carnival Dream has 30 smaller boats. Carnival Magic also has a large, highly visible SkyCourse ropes course forward of her funnel that is not present on her sister. There are 19 decks (although marked as having 15 decks on the deck plan because there is no \\"Deck 13\\" on Carnival ships) aboard Carnival Magic.  Drydock refurbishment  Carnival Magic was dry-docked in June 2016 which included refurbishment of some public areas. Cruising areas Carnival Magic spent her inaugural season, summer 2011, cruising the Mediterranean Sea. She then made a transatlantic crossing in autumn, 2011, and was homeported in Galveston, Texas from which she made Caribbean Sea cruises. In April, 2016, her homeport changed to Port Canaveral, Florida from which she continued making Caribbean cruises. Carnival Magic is set to reposition to Miami, Florida in September 2018, sailing 7-day eastern and western Caribbean cruises. She was expected to move homeport to Fort Lauderdale, Florida in May 2019.  Incidents and accidents  On 2 July 2012, during a seven-day Caribbean cruise, a 39-year-old male guest died when he accidentally fell from his cabin balcony and landed on an open deck area three decks below. In October 2014 a Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas employee who may have handled lab specimens from Ebola victim Thomas Eric Duncan after he boarded the ship on 12 October in Galveston. The hospital employee and her spouse showed no signs of the virus, but voluntarily quarantined themselves on the ship. The ship was allowed to dock in Belize, but the quarantined couple was refused the ability to disembark; thus derailing the plan to offload the couple for a flight home. Mexico went a step further and did not grant docking privileges to the ship. A United States Coast Guard helicopter flew to Carnival Magic on 18 October to obtain blood samples. The following day the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital employee and her spouse were allowed to disembark in Galveston after the tests were determined to be negative for both the employee and her spouse.

It is the main temple of the large Ngor school of Vajrayana Buddhism, which represents eighty-five percent of the Sakya school. History The origins of the Ngor school go back to Ngorchen Kunga Sangpo (also Kunga Zangpo or Kun dga 'bzang po, ) (1382-1444 CE), who was born and educated at Sakya and founded this monastery in 1429. It was renowned for its rich library of Sanskrit texts and magnificent 15th-century Newar-derived paintings. Of its 18 colleges, and Upper and Lower Tsokangs, only one building, the Lamdre Lhakang, has been restored. There were once some 400 monks, but now there are only a few.Dorje (1999), pp. 276-277.Dowman (1988), p. 275.Tucci (1980), p. 37. Below the lhakang there is a row of 60 stupa renovated but missing the magnificent mandala paintings they once contained, but which are now preserved in Japan and have been documented and published.Dorje (1999), p. 277. Ngorchen Konchog Lhundrup, born in Sakya in 1497, was a famous practitioner who became the tenth abbot of Ngor Ewam Choden monastery. The two other main sects of the Sakya school are Sakya proper and Tsar. The main Ngor temples are found in the Kham region of Tibet. The Ngorpa school is characterized by an emphasis on tantra balanced with study and practice. It is known for a mastery of ritual and practice of long retreats including lifelong retreats. The present leader of the Ngor is HE Luding (or Lhuding) Khenpo, who now lives in northern India.Mayhew, Bradley and Kohn, Michael. (2005), p. 280. Footnotes References * Dorje, Gyurme. (1999).

NECAMV included representatives from the NAACP, the Urban League, the Federal Council of Churches, and the American Federation of Labor, among others. Prominent individuals such as former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt also were members. The group was formed in order to lobby President Harry S Truman to take steps to more fully enforce the rights of African-Americans. Led by Walter Francis White, The NECAMV met with Truman on September 19, 1946 and, after relating to him in graphic detail the circumstances of the attacks, Truman insisted that something needed to be done to address the problem. He pledged to issue an executive order establishing a blue ribbon panel that would be charged with investigating the situation and proposing ways of reducing racial tensions and providing for more rigorous enforcement of civil rights. Truman made good on his pledge in December 1946, when he established the President's Committee on Civil Rights (PCCR). The following year, the PCCR issued its landmark report, To Secure These Rights, which established a blueprint for expanding the protections for civil rights, especially at the federal level.

Plot Graciela (Veronica in some edits) is a young orphan living alone in a dilapidated villa with her invalid grandmother and her superstitious nanny. The nanny fills Veronica's mind with sinister tales of witches, which she insists are real. Rather than being frightened, Graciela often comforts herself with these stories to feel more powerful than the girls at her parochial school, who mock and ostracize her for her strangeness. Shy, lonely Fabiola (Flavia in some edits), who comes from a very wealthy family, arrives as a new student. Graciela envies Fabiola's material wealth, as well as her doting parents. Hoping to impress Fabiola, Graciela boasts she is a real witch who can make anything she wants happen. Fabiola, who was raised an atheist, is skeptical of Graciela's claims, but also fearful. To convince her, Graciela takes credit for a series of strange coincidences by telling Fabiola that she caused them with black magic. Fabiola finds herself more and more terrified of Graciela, to the point of giving Graciela her most cherished possessions and obeying her whenever she asks. Delighting in her new power, Graciela continues to arrange frightening events in order to keep her new friend in her thrall. Graciela's demands culminate in a request to be taken along on Fabiola's family vacation to a remote ranch in the country. There Graciela announces her plan to make a poison for the fairies, which are said to be the natural enemies of witches. Fabiola becomes even more terrified at the thought of Graciela's power once the fairies are destroyed, but continues to help Graciela gather materials for the \\"poison,\\" requiring them to sneak out late at night and trespass into areas they are forbidden to go. When they are finally caught, Fabiola blurts out their plans to her parents, who sternly chastise both girls and tell them that witches aren't real. As punishment--and to reassert her hold over Fabiola--Graciela demands Fabiola give her her beloved pet dog and tells her that their plan will continue. This is the final straw for Fabiola, and she is finally compelled to stop Graciela by locking her into a barn and setting it on fire, where Graciela dies in the blaze.

Retrieved: June 27, 2013. Author and Artist Engström was born in Lönneberga, Kalmar County (Småland) but spent most of his childhood in Hult (near Eksjö), where his father was the railroad stationmaster. He graduated from Norrköping secondary school in 1888 and went to Uppsala University the following year to read Latin and Greek, a pursuit which he abandoned after two years. In 1892 he enrolled at the Valand School of Fine Arts in Gothenburg to study under Carl Larsson. Between 1894 and 1896 Albert Engström was on the editorial staff for the satirical publication Söndags-Nisse. In 1897 he founded the humor magazine Strix. Among the themes of his many illustrations were those of tramps and drunkards, and indeed alcohol, or rather its adverse effects, featured largely in his humour. One such recurring fictional character was Kolingen. In a book of autobiographical sketches the author Evert Taube described Engström: \\"He had a peculiar face with eyes like a bird of Minerva beneath a lofty forehead and bangs . . . a tough but sensitively chiseled nose and faunlike mouth surrounded by a scraggly French goatee — in short, a face that so captivated Swedes that all were compelled to look over to where he sat. He moved as softly and quietly as a bear and had the lanky appearance of a sailor from Småland. One began thinking of shipwrecks and sleigh rides when he entered a room. But he brought to mind other things as well. He could smile just like Velázquez’s god of wine and roar with laughter like a roustabout . . .\\" Jag kommer av ett brusand' hav by Evert Taube, (Stockholm: Albert Bonniers Förlag, 1952). Engström coined the word \\"Grönköping\\" in 1895 as a caption for some of his drawings, thereby inventing the fictional Swedish town of the same name. In 2002 the CD Grönköping Tar Ton was issued in Sweden to commemorate one hundred years of Grönköpings Veckoblad (Grönköping's Weekly), a satirical monthly magazine that was founded in 1902. The album, depicting Grönköping in recordings made between 1908 and 1946, is available through iTunes.Grönköping Tar Ton (Stockholm: Ancha, 2002).

Founded by Shelby Modell and Irwin M. Rosenthal, and formerly known as National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis and Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, it was incorporated on December 17, 1965. CCF has more than 50,000 members, served by the national headquarters, as well as over 40 chapters nationwide. Research, educational workshops and symposia, together with the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation scientific journal, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, enable medical professionals to keep pace with this rapidly growing field. The National Institutes of Health has commended the Foundation for \\"uniting the research community and strengthening IBD research\\". The Foundation ranks third among leading health non-profits in the percentage of expense devoted to mission-critical programs, with at least 80 cents of every dollar the Foundation spends going toward medical research, professional education, and patient support.

The Foundation has provided more than $150 million for Crohn's and colitis research to date. Patient and Professional Education and Support The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation offers literature and patient support services nationally as well as through its forty regional chapters. The Foundation provides information and education for the estimated 3.1 million inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and their families through a variety of periodicals (Take Charge, Under the Microscope ), books, awareness campaigns, local chapter events, Webcasts, and through its web site.[3] Due to its extensive public awareness and outreach efforts, the Foundation reaches at least one out of every 18 patients, compared to the Arthritis Foundation, with one out of every 85, or the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, with one out of every 435. Advocacy Advocacy is a major component of the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's mission. Its advocates are not only patients, but family members, friends, caregivers, and doctors who want to make their voices heard and see a future free from Crohn's and colitis. Foundation advocates call for increased Federal funding for Crohn's and colitis research and awareness programs designed to improve the lives of patients and improved access to care. The Foundation encourages its members, volunteers, and friends to become actively involved in advancing its public policy goals. Awareness Week The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation designated the week of December 1–7 as Crohn's and Colitis Awareness Week in order to encourage all Americans to join in the effort to find cures for these diseases, help raise awareness and support research. Fundraising The Crohn's & Colitis Foundation primarily relies on the support of members and donors to continue its work. The Foundation raises critical dollars through its local and nationwide special events, spearheaded by its national Team Challenge and Take Steps programs. Team Challenge is the Foundation's endurance training and fundraising program, which prepares participants to run or walk a half marathon, take part in a cycling event, or experience a sprint triathlon while raising money for a cure. Take Steps, the Foundation's largest fundraising event, mobilizes participants in over 150 local communities across the nation to come together and walk for Crohn’s and colitis research. http://online.ccfa.org/site/PageServer?pagename=TS_homepage The Foundation received $3,042,350 of grants from the United States Department of Health and Human Services between 2008 and 2015.\\"Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America\\".

Biography Blair was born on January 22, 1915, in Toledo, Ohio to Roy Robert and Georgia Gotshall Blair. He enrolled at Miami University, where he was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. He graduated in 1937. With the Great Depression having taken its toll on the family finances, Blair often hopped a freight train to get back and forth to college. On one fateful trip aboard a freight train, Blair - guarding his food stash - was attacked by hobos, who tossed him off the moving train. \\"The fall exacerbated George's spinal condition, displacing his spine three-quarters of an inch and pinching a bundle of nerves. He lived with the injury and the resulting pain for years while resisting an operation to fuse his spine.\\" He was not exposed to water skiing until 1955. In Florida while recovering from a fusion operation on his back, Blair was inspired to try water skiing when he saw skiers at the Lyle Lee Ski School in Fort Lauderdale. It wasn't long before they convinced him to try waterskiing himself. He fell in love with it, and he and his family returned to New Jersey and opened two ski schools, which they successfully owned and operated for over 20 years. Blair learned to ski on his bare feet when he was 46 years old. Since then, he won many awards and holds numerous records, including several entries in the Guinness World Records. Blair became the star of the Cypress Gardens daily water ski show - the longest running ski show in the world - in his hometown of Winter Haven, Florida. Upon his 91st birthday in 2006, Blair was named the Honorary Mayor of Cypress Gardens and was often seen thereafter donning the large yellow ribboned \\"Mayor\\" button he received. Blair continued his active lifestyle barefoot waterskiing and snowboarding until the age of 92. He then led a relatively quieter life at home in New York City, surrounded by family and following his passion for music by playing drums and attending jazz concerts. Blair died peacefully, at home, on October 17, 2013. Personal life In 1939, George married Dorothy Spies, of Detroit, and raised four daughters in Shrewsbury, New Jersey where he became a businessman and entrepreneur. In 1973, he married his second wife, JoAnne White, and the couple was married for over 40 years. One of water skiing's best-known couples, \\"Banana\\" George and JoAnne entertained and hosted countless national and international water skiing enthusiasts and champions in their homes in New Jersey, Florida, and New York City. Blair has four grandchildren, two great- granddaughters, and two great-grandsons. Scholarship On October 18, 2013, the Banana George Blair family and the American Water Ski Educational Foundation (AWSEF) established the \\"George Blair Ambassador Scholarship\\" - an annual college scholarship, awarded to a young water skier who exhibits excellence on the water, in the classroom, and in serving as an ambassador for the sport. The scholarship continues Blair's well-established legacy as a generous supporter of the sport.

PWU's Basic Education department (with Senior High School) is called the Jose Abad Santos Memorial School (PWU JASMS) and has two campuses in Manila and Quezon City. History = Higher education for Filipina women = In 1919, a group of women in the Philippines sought to empower women by allowing them access to education. Under the American colonial system from 1900 to July 4, 1946, education and democracy were the core of America's goal in developing the Philippines (which had been colonized by Spain for 300 years). Among the first, and perhaps most important, results of the American legacy was the recognition of equality of women in the Philippine islands and their right to be educated. A result of the combined vision of seven pioneering Filipino women — Clara Aragon, Concepcion Aragon, Francisca Tirona Benitez, Paz Marquez Benitez, Carolina Ocampo Palma, Mercedes Rivera and Socorro Marquez Zaballero — the Philippine Women's College (PWC) was founded with the assistance of the prominent lawyer, José Abad Santos, who drafted the university's constitution and by-laws. (Abad Santos was appointed by President Manuel L. Quezon to the Supreme Court of the Philippines and was martyred by the Japanese who occupied the Philippines during World War II). PWU's goal was to prepare young Filipino women for a life of useful citizenship and leadership. It had an initial enrollment of 190 students. The American colonial government recognized Philippine Women's College as a university in 1932, 13 years after the school opened its doors, becoming known henceforth as the Philippine Women's University, the first university for women in Asia founded by Asians. From 1928 up to the outbreak of the Second World War, Philippine Women's University pioneered in introducing programs aligned with its mission: Home Economics, Music and Fine Arts, Social Work, Nutrition, Pharmacy and Business. In 1938, a course in Social Civic training was incorporated into the curriculum. The academic programs were based on the founders' objectives to train Filipinas in civic responsibility. Established families from all over the Philippines who could afford higher education sent their daughters to PWU. Most institutions offering higher education at that time were exclusively for young men, like PWU's neighbor, De La Salle College. Schools for women offering higher education were operated by secular or religious sisters of the Roman Catholic Church, including PWU's neighbors, Santa Isabel College, Assumption College, St. Paul College, Manila, Maryknoll College, and St. Scholastica's College. There was also the Centro Escolar de Senoritas College which predated PWU by some 12 years, having been founded in 1907. The PWU had a more 'Americanized' curriculum than the former institution. = Second World War and afterward = The Japanese occupation of the Philippine islands from 1942 to 1945 did not stop the PWU community from continuing with its mission. For a time, classes at the PWU were held intermittently due to the extraordinary conditions imposed by the Japanese. The PWU campus, a building occupying an entire city block, was converted to a hospital, known as the \\"Pagamutan ng Maynila.\\" The university sustained major damage during the war and barely survived the siege during American and Philippine liberation of Manila on February 9, 1945. The school resumed its academic programs a few months before the Philippines became a free and independent republic on July 4, 1946. The university opened its doors to elementary and secondary education when it founded the Jose Abad Santos Memorial School (JASMS) which now has two campuses in Manila and Quezon City and is called PWU JASMS. Outside Metro Manila In less than 50 years since the university's founding, PWU opened similar campuses for women in the country bearing the Philippine Women's College name, such as in Iloilo City in the Visayas and Davao City in Mindanao (opened on June 8, 1953 and actively operating as 'Philippine Women's College of Davao' or PWC).Philippine Women’s College of Davao In 1972, the Iloilo City Colleges (now the University of Iloilo) purchased the PWC of Iloilo campus in its Jaro District. They turned the buildings into the Don Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital. Fifteen years later, in 1987, Don Benito Lopez Memorial Hospital was acquired by the West Visayas State University. It became the WVSU Hospital, a 150-bed tertiary, teaching and training hospital.WVSU History PWU opened a satellite campus in Cebu City but it closed down. It was at the corner of Leon Kilat and Colon Streets. They also had a satellite campus in Cagayan de Oro City, along Antonio Luna Extension, but was later closed and soon renamed \\"Professional World Academy\\". The PWC in Davao City was granted autonomy from PWU and operates under a separate charter as a co-educational institution. PWU started the Career Development and Continuing Education Center (CDCEC) in 1978 as a means to enable the benefits of a PWU education to reach other areas in the country. There are several CDCEC franchises in Calamba, Sta. Cruz, Baguio, Camarines Norte, Tarlac and Bulacan owned and operated by private individuals and groups. = Reform to a co-educational institution = The university had its first male president in 1993 with the election of Jose Conrado Benitez who had a strategic plan to diversify and to use information technology to transcend distance and bring functional education to everyone. *In the 1970s, PWU started admission of male enrollees as students and became co-educational. *In 2003, Amelia Benitez Reyes became the eighth university president. *In 2009, the Board of Trustees appointed Alfredo Benitez Reyes as the Chief Executive Officer. As CEO, Reyes became the de facto head of the institution. Amelia B. Reyes retired then. *In 2011, Jose Francisco Benitez became the ninth and second male president of the PWU. = Issues with STI = In 2011, PWU was involved in a joint venture plan to infuse much-needed capital from STI, an educational behemoth owned by Eusebio Tanco. The deal went sour in 2014 and a legal battle ensued when the Benitez family refused to accede to STI's plans to commercialize the PWU JASMS Quezon City campus. An amicable settlement was reached by the two parties in 2016 which saw STI stepping down from all involvement with PWU and JASMS in exchange for land owned by the Benitez family, which was used to pay back PWU's debts.

Among sheep shearers in Australia, \\"smoko\\" is a mid-morning break, between breakfast and lunch, in which a light meal may be eaten. There is a town in Victoria, Australia called Smoko, which \\"gained its name in the 1850s because gold seekers regularly stopped here for a smoke and a rest on their way to and from the goldfields\\". The term is believed to have originated in the British Merchant Navy, and was in use as early as 1865. The term is still in use in the British Merchant Navy today. The tradition of a smoko in the Australian sense seems to have begun amongst sheep shearers in the 1860s. Although a slang term, the word \\"smoko\\" has been used in government writing and industrial relations reports to mean a short work break. The term \\"smoko\\" has found an American foothold after being popularized by the Australian pub-punk band The Chats. Smoko as an Australian institution The smoko break in Australia has become an institution symbolic of working culture and even of workers' rights. The Australian Industrial Relations Commission has arbitrated cases of industrial action over workers' entitlement to a smoko break. There are, however, considerable health and productivity concerns about smoke breaks, and non-smoking workers are sometimes concerned that their smoking colleagues take more time on breaks. In 2006, the Australian government's Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources banned the \\"smoko\\" from its Canberra offices, prompting then Health Minister Tony Abbott to declare that the \\"smoko has had its day\\". In January 2010 the Health Department announced a ban on its employees taking cigarette breaks, or \\"smokos.\\" References Category:British Merchant Navy Category:Smoking Category:Nautical slang Category:Australian slang Category:Falkland Islands culture Category:New Zealand slang ","title":"Smoko"},{"id":"9477345","title":"United States House Small Business Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade and Entrepreneurship"},{"id":"9477361","title":"Mudanjiang Hailang International Airport"},{"id":"9477396","text":"Hasan Arfa (1895 in Tbilisi – 1983 in Monte Carlo) was an Iranian general and ambassador to the Pahlavi dynasty. He was a leading figure in the British military network in Iran. Early life Hasan Arfa was born in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire) to an Anglo-Russian mother and Iranian father. His mother, Ludmilla Jervis, was the daughter of a British diplomat and a Russian woman of the aristocratic Demidov family. His father, Reza Khan Arfa al-Dowleh, was a veteran Iranian diplomat serving as consul- general in Tbilisi; he later served as ambassador to Turkey and Russia. Arfa's parents divorced in 1900, after Arfa and his mother had moved to Paris, but his father, the senior Arfa al-Dowleh, provided comfortable homes in Europe for them. Arfa received his early education from tutors and later attended private schools in Switzerland, Paris, and Monaco. In 1914, he joined the Iranian Imperial Guards, and during the early part of World War I that organization sponsored his training as a cavalry officer with the Swiss army. He joined the Iranian gendarmerie in 1920, and later, the army. As a cavalry officer, he campaigned against rebellious tribes in Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Lorestan, and during the 1920s and rose rapidly through the ranks. The Pahlavis Arfa first met Reza Shah Pahlavi (ruled 1926 - 1941), who was then Minister of War, at the outset of the campaign against the Kurds in 1921. Reza Shah's forceful character left a deep impression on him, and Arfa remained a loyal supporter of the Pahlavis throughout his life. In 1923, Arfa married Hilda Bewicke, a British ballerina in Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev's Russian Ballet whom he met in Monaco; they had one daughter, Leila. He subsequently served a brief tour in 1926 as military attaché in London and attended the Staff College in Paris from 1927 to 1929. After his training in France, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and placed in command of the newly formed Pahlavi Guards Cavalry Regiment, which he turned into a highly disciplined and professional unit. Reza Shah made him commandant of the Military Academy and in 1932 promoted him to the rank of colonel. In 1934, Arfa accompanied Reza Shah on his official visit to Turkey. He was appointed inspector general of the cavalry and armed forces in 1936 and promoted to general in 1939. During the joint Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran in August 1941, the shah appointed Arfa chief of staff in charge of the defenses for Tehran. After the British and Soviets defeated the Iranian army and forced Reza Shah to abdicate, his son and successor, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi (r. 1941 - 1979), appointed Arfa chief of military intelligence. Arfa became involved in national politics during the 1940s and 1950s. As Chief of the General Staff from 1944 to 1946, he authorized the supply of weapons to the Shahsavan tribesmen who opposed the autonomous government of Azerbaijan. In early 1946, Arfa was instrumental in gathering signatures of parliamentary deputies for a petition supporting Iran's complaint before the United Nations Security Council that Soviet forces continued to occupy northern Iran in contravention of an agreement to withdraw. Arfa's actions placed him in the camp of political leaders who tended to perceive malevolent intentions in Soviet policies but benign intentions in British policies. The pro- Soviet/anti-British politicians denounced Arfa in parliament and the press, and consequently Prime Minister Ahmad Qavam insisted that Arfa be dismissed from his post as chief of the general staff. In 1946, Arfa was imprisoned for seven months. He was eventually exonerated, but he was retired summarily from active duty in March 1947. Arfa blamed his successor, Gen. Ali Razmara, for his forced retirement and subsequently co-operated with his political rivals, especially after Razmara was appointed prime minister in 1950. Nevertheless, Arfa genuinely was disturbed when Razmara was assassinated in 1951, because he believed the increasing level of political violence threatened the country. He served as minister of roads and communications in the brief government of Prime Minister Hosayn Ala during the month following Razmara's assassination, before the parliament voted in Mohammad Mossadegh as premier. Arfa distrusted Mossadegh and formed a political group, the National Movement, to disrupt gatherings of Mossadegh supporters, whom he considered to be extremists opposed to the continuation of the monarchy and a strong army. The National Movement's newspaper published many articles written by Arfa, supporting the shah and respect for Islam. Arfa maintained contact with a variety of political activists, including Mozaffar Baqai of the Toilers' party, the fiery preacher Ayatollah Sayyed Abu al-Qasem Kashani, and Shaban Jafari, an organizer of street mobs. Arfa became a founding member of the secret committee of military officers, the Committee to Save the Fatherland, formed in 1952 with the objective of overthrowing Mossadegh. Following the 1953 military coup that restored the shah to power, he served as Iran's ambassador to Turkey (1958 - 1961) and Pakistan (1961 - 1962). Subsequently he retired from active government service. He left Iran at the time of the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and died in Monte Carlo, Monaco in 1983.

History and design Modeled after a work boot, the house was built by shoe salesman Mahlon Haines in 1948 as a form of advertisement. His shoe business claimed it made shoes \\"from hoof to hoof\\" because the company began the process with raising the cattle. The house, which is tall and contains five stories, was once rented out to couples, and is now open for public tours. It is located on Shoe House Road, next to a shoe-shaped doghouse. Haines requested the design by handing a work boot to an architect and saying, \\"Build me a house like this.\\" The living room is located in the toe, the kitchen is located in the heel, two bedrooms are located in the ankle, and an ice cream shop is located in the instep. There is also a stained glass panel that shows Mahlon holding a pair of shoes with a message below it that reads, \\"Haines the Shoe Wizard\\". Fire escapes were added in the 1960s. Rental and ownership A 1999 view of the house Haines never lived in the shoe house but in his later years after marrying his 2nd wife he built a house across the street. The house was initially made available as a weekend vacation spot for 38 elderly couples a year; the first such couple were John F. and Liza Baum of Loganville. Shoe House vacation contests were also held for a few seasons among newlyweds affiliated with Haines' shoe stores; an early winner in 1950 had all expenses paid for a week, including the service of a maid and butler, and went home with a free pair of shoes. The house was offered for rent by the public in the mid-1950s. Upon Haines' death in 1962, the house was given to his employees, who sold it two years later to a dentist; after about 20 years of tours and service as an ice cream parlor, it started going to ruin until it was bought in 1987 by Haines' granddaughter, Annie Haines Keller, who began renovations. After Keller could no longer maintain the house, it was sold to Charles and Ruth Miller, who gave tours for eight years before selling it in 2003 to Colleen and Ronald Farabaugh. The house received a small renovation and new paint in 2007. The seventh owners were Jeff and Melanie Schmuck who bought the house in 2015. In 2018, with help by a local lift truck company, a water leak in the house's \\"toe\\" was repaired and the exterior was painted in the original canary-yellow color, with a brown sole and highlights added. Co-owner Melanie Schmuck died from \\"health complications\\" in February 2019. The Shoe House was visited in the eighth season of the reality television series The Amazing Race, originally broadcast in 2005, and was featured on HGTV's What's With That House in 2007. The Farabaughs were happy about the publicity though not permitted to talk about the house's appearance on The Amazing Race until two years later.

Historical treatment of David I and the Scottish church usually emphasises King David I of Scotland's pioneering role as the instrument of diocesan reorganisation and Norman penetration, beginning with the bishopric of Glasgow while David was Prince of the Cumbrians, and continuing further north after David acceded to the throne of Scotland. As well as this and his monastic patronage, focus too is usually given to his role as the defender of the Scottish church's independence from claims of overlordship by the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury. Renewed bishopric of Glasgow Almost as soon as he was in charge of the Cumbrian principality, David placed the bishopric of Glasgow under his chaplain, John, whom David may have met for the first time during his participation in Henry's conquest of Normandy after 1106.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 62. John himself was closely associated with the Tironensian Order, and presumably committed to the new Gregorian ideas regarding episcopal organisation. David carried out an inquest and afterwards assigned to the bishopric all the lands of his principality, except those in the east of his principality which were already governed by the Scotland- proper based bishop of St Andrews.To a certain extent, the boundaries of David's Cumbrian Principality are conjecture on the basis of the boundaries of the diocese of Glasgow; Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 67-8. David was responsible for assigning to Glasgow enough lands directly to make the bishopric self-sufficient and for ensuring that in the longer term Glasgow would become the second most important bishopric in the Kingdom of Scotland. By the 1120s, work also began on building a proper cathedral for the diocese.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"King David I and Glasgow\\", pp. 208-9. David would also try to ensure that his reinvigorated episcopal see would retain independence from other bishoprics, an aspiration which would generate a great deal of tension with the English church, where both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of York claimed overlordship.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, pp. 257-9. Innovations in the church system It was once held that the Scotland's episcopal sees and entire parochial system owed its origins to the innovations of David I. Today, scholars have moderated this view. Although David moved the bishopric of Mortlach east to his new burgh of Aberdeen, and arranged the creation of the diocese of Caithness, no other bishoprics can be safely called David's creation.Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 158; Duncan, Making of the Kingdom, pp. 257-60; see also Gordon Donaldson, \\"Scottish Bishop's Sees\\", pp. 106-17. The bishopric of Glasgow was restored rather than resurrected.Shead, \\"Origins of the Medieval Diocese of Glasgow\\", pp. 220-5. In the case of the Bishop of Whithorn, the resurrection of that see was the work of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, with King Fergus of Galloway and the cleric Gille Aldan.Oram, Lordship of Galloway, p. 173. That aside, Ailred of Rievaulx wrote in David's eulogy that when David came to power, \\"he found three or four bishops in the whole Scottish kingdom [north of the Forth], and the others wavering without a pastor to the loss of both morals and property; when he died, he left nine, both of ancient bishoprics which he himself restored, and new ones which he erected\\".A. O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 233. What is very likely is that, as well as preventing the long vacancies in bishoprics which had hitherto been common, David was at least partly responsible for forcing semi-monastic \\"bishoprics\\" like Brechin, Dunkeld, Mortlach (Aberdeen) and Dublane to become fully episcopal and firmly integrated into a national diocesan system.Barrow, Kingship and Unity, pp. 67-8 As for the development of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained.Ian B. Cowan wrote that \\"the principle steps were taken during the reign of David I\\": Ian B. Cowan, \\"Development of the Parochial System\\", p. 44. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.Thomas Owen Clancy, \\"Annat and the Origins of the Parish\\", pp. 91-115. Monasticism The modern ruins of Kelso Abbey. This establishment was originally at Selkirk from 1113, but was moved to Kelso in 1128 to better serve David's southern \\"capital\\" at Roxburgh. David was certainly at least one of medieval Scotland's greatest monastic patrons. In 1113, in perhaps David's first act as Prince of the Cumbrians, he founded Selkirk Abbey for the Tironensian Order. Several years later, perhaps in 1116, David visited Tiron itself, probably to acquire more monks; in 1128 he transferred Selkirk Abbey to Kelso, nearer Roxburgh, at this point his chief residence.Oram, David I: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 62; Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 145. In 1144, David and Bishop John of Glasgow prompted Kelso Abbey to found a daughter house, Lesmahagow Priory.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 145, 150. David also continued his predecessor Alexander's patronage of the Augustinians, founding Holyrood Abbey with monks from Merton Priory. David and Bishop John, moreover, established Jedburgh Abbey with canons from Beauvais in 1138.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, p. 150. Other Augustinian foundations included St Andrew's Cathedral Priory, established by David and Bishop Robert of St Andrews in 1140, which in turn founded an establishment at Loch Leven (1150x1153); an Augustinian abbey, whose canons were taken from Arrouaise in France, was established by the year 1147 at Cambuskenneth near Stirling, another prominent royal centre.A.A.M. Duncan, \\"The Foundation of St Andrews Cathedral Priory, 1140\\", pp. 25, 27-8. However, by 23 March 1137, David had also turned his patronage towards the Cistercian Order, founding the famous Melrose Abbey from monks of Rievaulx.Richard Fawcett & Richard Oram, Melrose Abbey, p. 20. Melrose would become the greatest medieval monastic establishment in Scotland south of the river Forth. It was from Melrose that David established Newbattle Abbey in Midlothian, Kinloss Abbey in Moray, and Holmcultram Abbey in Cumberland.Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, illus 1, p. 15. David also, like Alexander, patronized Benedictines, introducing monks to Coldingham (a non- monastic property of Durham Priory) in 1139 and making it a priory by 1149.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 146-7. David's activities were paralleled by other \\"Scottish\\" magnates. For instance, the Premonstratensian house of Dryburgh Abbey was founded in 1150 by monks from Alnwick Abbey with the patronage of Hugh de Morville, Lord of Lauderdale.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, pp. 150-1. Moreover, six years after the foundation of Melrose Abbey, King Fergus of Galloway likewise founded a Cistercian abbey from Rievaulx, Dundrennan Abbey, which would become a powerful landowner in both Galloway and Ireland and was known to Francesco Pegolotti as Scotland's richest abbey.Keith J. Stringer, \\"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\\", .pp. 128-9; Keith J. Stringer, The Reformed Church in Medieval Galloway and Cumbria, pp. 11, 35. The modern ruins of Melrose Abbey. Founded in 1137, this Cistercian monastery became one of David's greatest legacies. Not only were such monasteries an expression of David's undoubted piety, but they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, being founded by French or English monks. They provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. This was particularly the case with the Augustinians.Peter Yeoman, Medieval Scotland, p. 15. Moreover, these new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. In the words of one historian, the Cistercians were \\"pioneers or frontiersmen ... cultural revolutionaries, who carried new techniques of land management and new attitudes towards land exploitation\\".Fawcett & Oram, Melrose Abbey, p. 17. Duncan calls Scotland's new Cistercian establishments \\"the largest and most significant contribution by David I to the religious life of the kingdom\\".Duncan, Scotland: The Making of a Kingdom, p. 148. Cistercians equated spiritual health with economic achievement and environmental exploitation. Cistercian labour transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's main sources of sheep wool.See, for instance, Stringer, The Reformed Church in Medieval Galloway and Cumbria, pp. 9-11. Ecclesiastical disputes One of the first problems David had to deal with as king was an ecclesiastical dispute with the English church. The problem with the English church concerned the subordination of Scottish sees to the archbishops of York and/or Canterbury, an issue which since his election in 1124 had prevented Robert of Scone from being consecrated. It is likely that since the 11th century, the bishopric of St Andrews functioned as a de facto. In the recently recovered last 20% of Version-A of the St. Andrews Foundation Legend, a text composed at the turn of the 11th and 12th centuries, some of the contemporary clerics at the bishopric of St Andrews were mentioned by name, and one of these is \\"Archbishop Giric\\", referring to Bishop Giric.Dauvit Broun, \\"Recovering the Full Text of Version A of the Foundation Legend\\", pp. 108-14. Bishop Fothad II, upon his death in 1093, was recorded in the Annals of Ulster as \\"Fothud ardepscop Alban\\", that is, \\"Fothad, Archbishop of Scotland\\".AU 1093.2, text & English translation; see also Alan Orr Anderson, Early Sources , p. 49 The problem was that this archiepiscopal status had not been cleared with the papacy, opening the way for English archbishops to claim overlordship of the whole Scottish church. The man responsible was the new aggressively assertive archbishop of York, Thurstan. In 1125 Thurstan once again went on the offensive. In this year Pope Honorius II wrote to David and ordered him to receive his legate, John de Crema, and to: > \\"Cause also the bishops of thy land to assemble to his council when they are > summoned by him. The controversy which has long been kept up between > Thurstan, archbishop of York, and the bishops of thy land, we commit to this > our legate to be very carefully investigated and discussed; but we reserve > the final decision for the judgment of the apostolic see\\".Symeon of Durham, > s.a. 1125; trans. in A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 158-9. No legatine council however took place, and legate John de Crema headed back through southern England.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, p. 159; Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 259. The legate was charged with investigating the historical and political status of the bishoprics of Scotland-proper, the lands north of the river Forth. However, such investigation was not needed for the two bishoprics south of the Forth. In the same year, Honorius wrote to John, bishop of Glasgow, and Gille Aldan, bishop of Galloway, ordering them to submit to the archbishopric of York.A.O. Anderson, Scottish Annals, pp. 160-1. As the former was part of David's dominion, this was not the news David would have been wanting. David ordered Bishop John of Glasgow to travel to the Apostolic See in order to secure a pallium which would elevate the bishopric of St Andrews to an archbishopric.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, p. 259; Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 49. Thurstan soon arrived in Rome himself, as did the archbishop of Canterbury, William de Corbeil, and both presumably opposed David's request. David however gained the support of King Henry, and the archbishop of York agreed to a year's postponement of the issue and to consecrate Robert of Scone without making an issue of subordination.Duncan, p. 260; John Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, (Glasgow, ), ed. J. Maitland Thomson, (Glasgow, 1912) pp. 4-5. York's claims over bishops north of the Forth were in practice abandoned for the rest of David's reign, although York maintained her more credible claims over Glasgow.Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, pp. 60-1. Bishopric of Durham and the Archbishopric of York However, David's successes were in many ways balanced by his failures. David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant since the death of Bishop Geoffrey in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the de facto bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the chapter. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time William de St Barbara was elected to the see in 1143. David also attempted to interfere in the succession to the archbishopric of York. William FitzHerbert, nephew of King Stephen, found his position undermined by the collapsing political fortune of Stephen in the north of England, and was deposed by the pope. David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with Henry Murdac, the new archbishop. Despite the support of Pope Eugenius III, supporters of King Stephen and William FitzHerbert managed to prevent Henry taking up his post at York. By 1149, Henry had sought the support of David. David seized on the opportunity to bring the archdiocese under Scottish control, and marched on the city. However, Stephen's supporters had gotten wind of the plan, and informed King Stephen. Stephen therefore marched to the city and installed a new garrison. David decided not to risk such an engagement and withdrew.For David's struggle for control over Durham see Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, pp. 169-75, for York, see pp. 186-9. Richard Oram has conjectured that David's ultimate aim was to bring the whole of the ancient kingdom of Northumbria into his dominion. For Oram, this event was the turning point, \\"the chance to radically redraw the political map of the British Isles lost forever\\".Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 189. Failure of the Archbishopric of St Andrews A further blow occurred on the ecclesiastical front. In 1151, David once again requested a pallium for the archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the Cardinal was on his way to Ireland (usually reached from Galloway) with four pallia to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the Cardinal returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, the Cardinal does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In fact, in the following year the papacy dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.Oram, David: The King Who Made Scotland, p. 155.

General Prats, who had been commander-in-chief of the armed forces during the administration of Salvador Allende, had strongly criticized Pinochet's 1973 coup which deposed Allende; Prats went into voluntary exile in Argentina. Aranciba was working for the government of Augusto Pinochet. He was convicted of the assassinations in Argentina. After serving 20 years in prison, Aranciba was paroled in July 2007. He was found stabbed to death in his apartment in Buenos Aires, Argentina in April 2011.https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/30/world/americas/30argentina.html Background Arancibia was associated with the right-wing group that killed Chilean Army Chief of Staff René Schneider in 1970 during a botched kidnapping. General Schneider had supported Allende's election by writing the Schneider Doctrine, which advocated an apolitical military. Aranciba was not directly linked with Schneider's death. After Schneider's murder, Arancibia left Chile and took up residence in unofficial exile in Buenos Aires, Argentina. In Argentina, Arancibia acted as a liaison between DINA and the Argentine secret police. He became involved in the assassination of Prats and his wife, who went into exile in Argentina following Pinochet's coup. The assassination was part of Operation Condor, a campaign of political repression and terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents, officially implemented in 1975 by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America against left-wing rivals. Arancibia received assistance from Michael Townley in planning and carrying out the attack, which reportedly also involved Italian terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie. The Italian ultimately testified against both Townley and Arancibia. In 1978, shortly after the extradition of Townley to the United States for the murder of diplomat Orland Letelier in Washington, DC in 1976, Arancibia was arrested by Argentine intelligence officers and charged with espionage. He was convicted and sentenced to life for the 1974 assassination of General Prats in Buenos Aires; this sentence was upheld in an Argentine court in August 2004, the court thereby ruling that crimes against humanity do not have a statutory limit in Argentina, including those committed during the Dirty War. Townley was also involved in General Prats' assassination, but never tried for the crime. (Townley served 62 months of a 10-year sentence for his role in the assassination of Orlando Letelier, Chilean Ambassador to the US, who was killed in Washington, D.C. in 1976. Townley's plea bargain for confessing to the Letelier assassination provided immunity from further prosecution, preventing his extradition to Argentina on charges relating to the Prats' assassination). In addition, Arancibia was convicted and sentenced to 12 years in 2004 by an Argentine court for the kidnapping of Laura Elgueta and another Chilean woman in Buenos Aires. Elgueta was later charged with relaying communications for the ex–Minister of Defence Vivianne Blanlot. Although the Prats case was still open in Chile, Arancibia was freed under parole for technical reason in July 2007, after nearly 20 years of prison in Argentina. Aranciba was found dead in Buenos Aires in April 2011.

It was an organized and codified version of local games called \\"base\\" or \\"round ball\\", and related to Philadelphia town ball and rounders. The Massachusetts Game is remembered as a rival of the New York Game of baseball, which was based on Knickerbocker Rules. In the end, however, it was the New York style of play which was adopted as the \\"National Game\\" and was the fore-runner of modern baseball. Rules The form of the Massachusetts Game that is best known today comes from a set of rules drawn up in 1858 by the Massachusetts Association of Base Ball Players at Dedham. Although it was recognizably a type of baseball, some features of the Massachusetts Game are very different from modern baseball: * The playing field had four bases, 60 feet apart. The fourth base was still called Home, but the \\"striker\\" stood midway between fourth and first base. * Fielders were allowed to put a runner out by hitting him with a thrown ball - a practice called \\"soaking\\" or \\"plugging\\". * There was no foul territory, and baserunners were not required to stay within the baselines. Two \\"modern\\" features of the Massachusetts Game were not present in New York-style rules drawn up the same year by National Association of Base Ball Players.http://wiki.vbba.org/index.php/Rules/1858 * \\"The Ball must be thrown - not pitched or tossed...\\" In the jargon of the times (as in cricket), throwing meant delivering the ball overhand. The NABBP rules state \\"The ball must be pitched, not jerked nor thrown\\", meaning delivered underhand. Major League baseball did not allow overhand pitching for another 25 years. * \\"The ball must be caught flying in all cases.\\" Under New York rules, a catch on one bounce was still allowed (cf. \\"on the full\\" in cricket). Style of play The Massachusetts Game was more wide-open than modern \\"New York\\" baseball, with more scoring and, its proponents claimed, more excitement. First base was only 30 feet away from the striker. There was a constant supply of baserunners, and much more action on the basepaths. The \\"soaking\\" rule was mitigated by the lightness of the ball, about 2-1/2 ounces compared to 5 ounces for a modern baseball. The runner could evade the fielders' throws by leaving the baseline. The absence of foul territory allowed a skillful striker to literally \\"use the whole field\\" when he put the ball in play. One of a striker's greatest skills (writes David Block) was to tip the ball back over the catcher's head. The rules allowed 10 to 14 players on a side, to help cover the whole field. But put-outs were hard to come by, so the rule was \\"one out, all out\\" - a team's inning ended when one player was put out. Runs were plentiful. The rules declared the winner to be the first team to score 100 runs. In an appreciation of the Massachusetts Game, sports historian John Thorn wrote in The Boston Globe of Sunday, July 10, 2005: \\"All that the Massachusetts Game had going for it was joy.\\" Ball clubs playing the Massachusetts Game The Olympic Club of Boston, \\"established in 1854, was the first regularly organized Club in the State, and for over a year the only one in the field.\\" The Elm-Tree Club played the first match game against the Olympic club, but was short-lived. The Green Mountain Club, established 1856, played many matches on Boston Common against the Olympics. Others playing by the Massachusetts Rules included the American, Bay State, Bunker Hill, and Rough-and-Ready Clubs (all organized in 1857), and the Alpha of Ashland, Bowdoin, Fayville of Southborough, Lowell, Shawmut, Takewambait of Natick, Yankee of Natick, and Waponset Clubs. There was also a junior club called the Hancocks. Many Boston firms closed on Saturday afternoons so their clerks could benefit from the game. A team of truckmen also played in the early mornings on Boston Common, before beginning their work day. As Kirsch relates in Baseball in Blue and Gray, in June 1857 an informal Massachusetts championship tournament was held, with about 2,000 spectators attending the first round. Twenty-five runs were needed to win a game, and three victories decided the match. The Wassapoag (or Massapoag) club of Sharon defeated the Olympics but then lost to the Union Club of Medway. Some confusion over the rules at this tournament led to the Dedham convention the following year, at which rules were drawn up. The rules as adopted were those of the Takewambait Club. Members of the Tri-Mountain Club – founded by an Edward Saltzman, a transplant from the Gotham Club – lobbied hard for New York rules, but the Tri-Mountains were in a minority. (They dropped out of the association, and began playing the New York style.) In June 1858 the 'Winthrop Club of Holliston beat the Olympics on Boston Common by a score 100 to 27, in a 4-hour game before 3,000 spectators. In September 1859 Winthrop Club battled the Union Club for the state championship. The two-day match drew huge crowds to the Boston Agricultural Fair Grounds, to see the Unions defeat the Winthrops, 100-71. By 1860, 59 New England teams were reportedly playing the Massachusetts Game, while at least 18 had gone over to New York style.http://www.osv.org/learning/DocumentViewer.php?Action=View&DocID;=1985 Massachusetts Game distinctions Two \\"longest game\\" records are held by Massachusetts rules contests.http://www.sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/Lowry_LongestGames_Article.pdf * On July 28, 1859, in a game at Ashland, the Medway Unions defeated the Upton Excelsiors 100-78 in 211 innings. Although these innings were defined by one out – and not three – this was the most innings ever played in a baseball game. * The following year, at the Worcester Agricultural Fairgrounds the same two clubs played the longest game ever in the history of baseball. According to Philip J. Lowry in the SABR 2004 Baseball Research Journal: \\"The game was scheduled to begin Sep 25, 1860. Play continued through Sep 26, 27, 28; Oct 1, 4, and 5 until finally it was called a complete game with the score Upton 50 Medway 29. The game took a record 21 hours 50 minutes of actual game time.\\" They generally played each day from 9:30 a.m. to 5:00 pm, with a one-hour break for lunch. In one contemporary journalist's opinion, \\"The time occupied in playing the game under such rules was, we think, rather too much of a good thing.\\" * Irving Leitner designates the same 1860 match as the first baseball game played for a monetary stake. Upton had originally issued a challenge to the Brooklyn Atlantics - champions of the New York Game - the terms to be $1000 winner take all, 100 runs, Massachusetts rules. After much consideration the Atlantics declined, citing a lack of practice time (but scoffing at the idea that Upton was any match for them). Medway took Brooklyn's place for the same stakes. Although the rules required 100 tallies for a victory, the two clubs agreed to call it a complete game at 50. After six days and 172 innings of play, rain prevented resumption on the seventh day, and the lease on the field had run out. The victorious Upton Excelsiors declared themselves baseball champions of the world. * The first intercollegiate baseball match was played between Amherst College and Williams College, under Massachusetts rules on July 1, 1859 at Pittsfield. Amherst issued the challenge to a baseball match, and Williams counter-challenged them to a chess match. They agreed on Pittsfield as a neutral site, hosted by the Pittsfield Base Ball Club and Pittsfield Chess Club. A newspaper headline announced “Williams and Amherst Base Ball and Chess! Muscle and Mind!!” Each base ball team fielded 13 players, chosen by vote of the student body. Amherst won 73-32 in 26 innings. The next day Amherst completed the sweep by winning the chess match as well.http://www.williams.edu/home/focus/baseball/ Civil War period During the American Civil War, soldiers from Massachusetts often played their brand of baseball when competing among themselves, but sometimes switched to New York rules when playing men from that state. Kirsch tells of the 19th Massachusetts Regiment encamped in Falmouth in early 1863 when a “base ball fever broke out.” Later that year the Clipper reported a Massachusetts Rules match for $60 a side, between the 11th Massachusetts and the 26th Pennsylvania Regiment. While the Massachusetts Game was popular among soldiers, it was losing favor on the home front. Particularly damaging was a trip to Boston by the mighty Excelsior Club of Brooklyn in 1862. The Brooklynites defeated the Bowdoins 41-15, then a picked nine from the Tri-Mountains and Lowells 39-13. This began a conversion of the Boston clubs to the New York style of play. By the end of the war, the country had standardized around the New York Game.

He is known for his work on the Zodiac killer case.  Career  Graysmith worked as a political cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle in 1969, when the Zodiac killer case came to prominence. He attempted to decode letters written by the killer and became obsessed with the case over the next 13 years. Graysmith wrote two books about the case; his 1986 book Zodiac was the basis for the 2007 film by the same name. He eventually gave up his career as a cartoonist to write five more books on high-profile crimes, one of which became the basis for the film Auto Focus (2002).  Personal life  Graysmith was married to Margaret Ann Womack from 1963 to 1973. He married Melanie Krakower in 1975, but they divorced in 1980; he directly attributes his failed marriage to his intense interest in the Zodiac case. The film Zodiac (2007), directed by David Fincher, was based on his books and featured Jake Gyllenhaal as Graysmith.

It is located north of Nanchang. Construction began in October 1996 and the airport went into operation on 10 September 1999, replacing Nanchang Xiangtang Airport. It was upgraded to an international airport and was greatly expanded in 2008–2011. History Nanchang Xiangtang Airport, a dual-use civil and military airport, served as Nanchang's main airport from 1957 to 1999. From 102 passengers in 1957, by 1996 Xiangtang served more than 800,000 passengers annually and could no longer accommodate more traffic. In 1996, construction began for Changbei Airport, originally designed to handle 2 million passengers annually. On 10 September 1999, Changbei Airport was opened and all commercial flights were transferred from Xiangtang, which reverted to sole military use. In 2003, Capital Airport Holding took over the operation of Changbei Airport from the Jiangxi Provincial Government. In the same year, it handled more than 1 million annual passengers for the first time. In 2004, Changbei was upgraded to an international airport. Passenger volume grew exponentially in the 2000s, and the airport underwent major expansion in 2008. At its completion in 2011, Changbei Airport became a Class 4E international airport, capable of handling 12 million passengers per year. However, the rapid expansion of China's high- speed railway network diverted much of the airport's passenger volume, and passenger growth at Changbei slowed to 6.3%, 3.4%, and 5% in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The governments of Nanchang city and Jiangxi province began subsidizing new flights in 2017 and passenger volume grew by 39% in that year and exceeded 10 million for the first time. By 2018, the airport hosts 46 airlines, which operate 127 routes connecting Nanchang with 68 cities. The third phase of expansion, which will connect the airport to Nanchang Metro and the high-speed railway network, is under construction.

It was distributed by Paramount Pictures and produced by MTV Films. The film received mixed reviews, and earned less than half of its $25 million production budget at the box office. The title refers to the U.S. government's controversial stop-loss policy, which allows the government to extend the term of duty of soldiers who have already served their contracted number of years of service. Plot U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Brandon King (Ryan Phillippe) leads a squad stationed in Tikrit during the Iraq War. The film begins with footage from the tour of the squad, explaining they have 28 days before returning to the United States. While on duty at a checkpoint, the squad hears gunshots, after which a car speeds past filled with insurgents, one of whom fires an AK-47 at them. King's men jump into their Humvees and follow the insurgents into an alley. When the soldiers get out of their vehicles, the insurgents ambush them from rooftops. As the firefight ensues, a rocket propelled grenade (RPG) is discharged, destroying one of the Humvees, killing two soldiers inside. Shortly after, another RPG is discharged, exploding an Iraqi vehicle. Squad member PFC Tommy Burgess (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is unfortunately near the vehicle when the RPG is discharged but another soldier, Pvt. Rico Rodriguez, dives on Burgess and saves him. This is at the expense of severely wounding Pvt. Rodriguez. Shortly after, fellow squad member Paul \\"Preacher\\" Colston, a close friend of Tommy, is shot in the neck and jaw in front of Tommy, and is killed instantly. Later, when Staff Sergeant King enters a house to help injured long-time friend and squad member Sgt. Steve Shriver (Channing Tatum), he discovers that he had accidentally killed several Iraqi civilians by throwing a grenade to kill an insurgent in a room, unaware of any civilians present in the area. Brandon is visibly shocked and the ambush ends with three soldiers killed. Upon returning to their Texas hometown of Brazos, Brandon and Steve are decorated with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in a solemn ceremony. A U.S. Senator takes Brandon aside after the ceremony and offers to help Brandon in any way he can. That night, Steve shows the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder. He gets drunk and digs a foxhole in his front yard, and strikes his fiancée Michelle (Abbie Cornish) in the face. When Brandon comes over to check on Steve, he is unable to get through to him. Tommy drives over drunk after his wife has kicked him out. The next day, Brandon suggests that they all go to the \\"ranch\\", a small forest cabin located outside of town. The men pass the time by drinking and watching Tommy shoot his wedding gifts, after their friend Shorty reads the cards. Upon hearing the commotion, a hungover Steve awakens and shoots the cards to silence them and to show his skills in sniping. The next day, Brandon, Tommy and Steve report to their military base. When Brandon arrives expecting to be discharged, he is unexpectedly ordered back to active duty in Iraq, based on the military's controversial stop-loss policy, which required soldiers who had fulfilled their required tours of duty to return to the war. He refuses to comply and goes AWOL, becoming a deserter. Michelle sympathizes with Brandon's refusal and offers to travel with him to Washington, D.C. to see the Senator who offered to assist Brandon earlier. During a multi-day drive to Washington, D.C., Brandon calls the Senator's office and is told that because he is now a fugitive, the Senator is not interested in seeing him. Brandon and Michelle also visit the family of Paul \\"Preacher\\" Colson, one of the three soldiers under Brandon's command killed in the alley ambush and encounter another AWOL soldier who recommends a lawyer to help arrange forged discharge documents so he could establish a new identity in Canada. They also visit Rico Rodriguez, a soldier who was blinded, lost his right arm and leg, and sustained facial burns from saving Tommy from a rocket-propelled grenade, previously during the ambush in Iraq. After Michelle phones Steve to tell him of their exact location, he arrives in uniform to take Brandon back, and tells Michelle he has volunteered to return to Iraq. Brandon refuses to return and Michelle is furious with Steve for re-enlisting and ends their relationship. Brandon and Michelle finally reach New York City and meet with the lawyer, who gives Brandon forged papers and a passport which would allow him to flee to Canada in exchange for payment of $1000. Tommy, who is depressed after being discharged from the army, commits suicide, Brandon returns to visit Tommy's grave immediately after the funeral, only to end up in a dispute with Steve, ultimately turning into a physical battle ending with Brandon leaving the cemetery and Steve weeping. Brandon, his mother and Michelle drive to the Mexican border, but Brandon ultimately decides that he does not want to abandon everything that he has ever known. He also tells his mother and Michelle that if he goes to Mexico he'll never really be able to leave the war behind him. The final scene depicts a busload of soldiers, including Brandon and Steve, returning to the war.

Hand, Jr., and built in 1921, in East Boothbay, Maine, at the Hodgdon Brothers Shipyard now known as Hodgdon Yachts. She is the only American schooner built specifically for Arctic exploration, and was designed under the direction of explorer Donald B. MacMillan. She has made 29 trips above the Arctic Circle in her life, three since she was acquired by the Maine Maritime Academy in 1988. She is currently owned by the Maine Maritime Academy, located in Castine, Maine, and is used for their sail training curriculum. She is named for Bowdoin College.Peary-MacMillan Arctic Museum , Bowdoin College. History Bowdoin (with igloo habitats) frozen in Arctic ice (1923)\\"In Touch with the World from the Arctic\\" by Burnham McLeary, Radio Broadcast, August 1923, page 286. The schooner's design and construction were carefully considered and well- executed, although neither was radical for their day. Bowdoin first crossed the Arctic Circle on 23 August 1921. A place unknown to most of the world, the Arctic had had few visitors. Only sixteen years before, the goal of many generations of Arctic explorers had been reached when a northwest passage was traversed — a route which was, practically speaking, unusable, and after the construction of the Panama Canal, no longer necessary. Peary's North Pole expedition was merely a dozen years past. The last few Hudson's Bay and Davis Strait whalers had made their final trip home two years before. Bowdoin sailed north with Macmillan two dozen times, carrying scientists, adventurers, and students. World War II On 22 May 1941 the United States Navy purchased Bowdoin from MacMillan for use during the war. She was placed in commission as USS Bowdoin (IX-50) on 16 June 1941. She was one of the very few sail powered vessels commissioned in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Her first commanding officer was her previous owner, Lieutenant Commander Donald B. MacMillan. (MacMillan had received a commission in the Naval Reserve in 1925 and was retired for age in 1938 but volunteered for active duty in 1941 at the age of 66.) MacMillan was soon reassigned to the Navy's hydrographic office. As of March 1, 1942, her commanding officer was Lieutenant (junior grade) Stuart T. Hotchkiss.U.S. Navy Directory. March 1, 1942. Bowdoin was assigned to the South Greenland Patrol but did not report for duty at Ivigtut. The Greenland patrol existed for two major purposes: to assist in the defense of Greenland and to support the Army in its task of setting up air bases on Greenland as stopover and fueling points for aircraft being ferried to Great Britain. Bowdoin provided services in conjunction with air base site surveys and construction. That assignment lasted about 27 months. During that time, in October 1941, the two portions of the Greenland Patrol — the northeast and Bowdoins south — were combined into a single command, the Greenland Patrol, Task Group 24.8 which took its orders directly from Commander in Chief, Atlantic Fleet. About two years after that event, on 23 October 1943, the auxiliary schooner was placed in reduced commission. On 16 December 1943, Bowdoin was placed out of commission at Quincy, Massachusetts. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 16 May 1944. She was sold as a hulk on 24 January 1945 through the Maritime Commission's War Shipping Administration. Purchased by friends of MacMillan, the battered schooner was refitted once again for Arctic exploration. Bowdoin was one of a very few sail powered vessels in commissioned service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Post-war In 1959, Admiral MacMillan (who was promoted to rear admiral by a special act of Congress in 1954) sailed the vessel to Mystic Seaport, in Mystic, Connecticut, and turned it over to them for display. Little was done with the ship, and the seaport removed (and broke) its masts and left it in a state of neglect. In 1967, at MacMillan's urging, the Schooner Bowdoin Association, Inc spearheaded by Dr. Edward Morse (the last surviving member of Admiral MacMillan's arctic voyages) was formed including friends of the admiral's, former crew members and others interested in saving the ship. Mystic Seaport relinquished the schooner to the Association, which leased her to Captain Jim Sharp of Camden, Maine. Sharp restored the schooner to operating condition and sailed her to Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1969 on a sentimental journey to MacMillan's home, where the admiral, in his 90s, saw Bowdoin sail again one last time. Jim Sharp had restored what he could on Bowdoin for $25,000, using her as a wharfside museum in Camden, Maine and sailing her on charters. In the mid-1970s, though, Coast Guard requirements for passenger carrying, which would have called for rebuilding the schooner and destroying her historic character, forced Sharp to return Bowdoin to the Schooner Bowdoin Association. Used for sail training and leased by the Association to various groups, Bowdoin has persevered since then. A major restoration effort at the Maine Maritime Museum between 1980-1984 brought the schooner back to excellent condition. The work was supervised by Jim Stevens, owner of the Goudy-Stevens Yard in East Boothbay, formerly Hodgdon Brothers, who first built Bowdoin in 1921. Bowdoin was declared the official sailing vessel of the state of Maine in 1986. In 1989 Bowdoin was designated a National Historic Landmark in recognition for her significant role in Arctic exploration. and The restored schooner sailed in OpSail '86 in New York harbor in the parade of ships that celebrated the Statue of Liberty's restoration. In 1987–1988 she was leased to Outward Bound, Inc., an educational organization, and in 1988 was turned over to the Maine Maritime Academy in Castine, Maine on a two-year lease with an option to buy. In 1990 Bowdoin sailed to Labrador, which was her first voyage to the North since the 1950s. In 1991 she carried students for the first time since her arrival at Maine Maritime Academy, traveling 150 miles North of the Arctic Circle to Disko Island, Greenland under the command of Captain Andy Chase. She has generally remained in the area of the maritime provinces of Canada with visits to St. Pierre and Miquelon as well as Newfoundland and Labrador. She did return to the Arctic in 1994, when she sailed 250 miles North of the Arctic Circle to Umanaq, Greenland, under the command of Captain Elliot Rappaport. Bowdoin's most recent voyage north of the Arctic Circle got underway in the early summer of 2008 with Captain Richard Miller in command. Between June and August 2014, Bowdoin was fitted with a new laminated mast after the previous mast was found to be \\"compromised\\". On August 15, 2014, Bowdoin set sail for Nova Scotia, with Eric Jergenson in command.

Primarily used in conjunction with tilt frame bodies and specialised containers, generally designed for the transportation of materials in the waste, recycling, scrap and demolition industries.Adams, A. (2005) Trucking: tractor-trailer driver handbook/workbook, p.391 Cengage Learning. . Retrieved August 2011 The system employs a series of hydraulic rams to hook, lift and hoist the container onto the chassis of the truck. There are several configuration options, and strict guidelinesOffice of the Federal Register (U.S.) (2010) Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Transportation, Pt. 300-399, Revised as of October 1, 2009 p.475. Government Printing Office. . Retrieved August 2011 which must be followed to ensure that the container is secured on the truck in transit.  Load capacity  Lift and dump capacities of hydraulic hooklift hoists typically range from . Generally a hoist is capable of lifting (off the ground) and dumping (onto the ground) the same maximum capacity, although there can be exceptions where short wheel bases are involved. The ratio of container length to chassis length is a factor in achieving rated load capacity. This ratio determines the load angle, and all hooklift hoist systems indicate a recommended range of body lengths, typically difference in length between the container and the chassis. Container bodies shorter than the recommended length produce substantially steeper load angles, and consequently lower load rating, than those of the longest bodies intended for use with a particular hoist. Chassis frame height is also important, as the lower the chassis frame height, the lower the potential load angle. A combination of low chassis with the longest recommended body lengths offers the best case. Finally, hook height has an effect, as a taller hook height achieves a greater lift and dump capacity.  System components  = Hydraulic system = The hydraulic operating pressure of all hooklift hoists are preset at the factory to achieve the intended lifting capacity for the design application. The original approach used by early European models, still widely used today, was a high pressure / low volume system. This setup suits chassis with space restraints, allowing for use of a smaller piston pump and a smaller hydraulic reservoir. Such systems operate between . The North American market developed low pressure / high volume systems, which allowed operators to share the hoist's hydraulic system with other hydraulically powered devices. These systems typically operate with a larger gear pump and larger hydraulic reservoir. Operating pressures range from . = Jib system = There are two common types of jib system, each controlled by a single hydraulic cylinder. Both systems can be used with either a single or dual rear pivot section. * The articulating jib, also referred to as a tilting jib, is a simple a-frame. When extending the cylinder, the container/body is pushed up and back, exiting the rear locks. When retracting the cylinder, the container/body is pulled forward and down, engaging the rear locks. * The sliding jib consists of a single arm, composed of a tube inside a tube. When extending the cylinder, this design pulls the container/body forward, engaging the rear locks. When retracting the cylinder, this design pushes the container/body rearward, exiting the rear locks. = Rear pivot section = * The single rear pivot system is the simpler of the two rear pivot designs. Every function operates relative to a pivot point, typically located in front of the rear axle. This design does not allow traditional tip-dumping capabilities. * The dual rear pivot system is more complex, offering the added benefit of a traditional tip- dumping capability. This is achieved by pivoting at the rear of the hoist, typically behind the rear axle. 25-ton hooklift hoist (dual lift/dump cylinder) mid lift = Rear lock system = There are typically two styles of rear lock. Both styles can be located on the hoist such that they are positioned either on the inside or outside of the container/body long rails. * The prong style rear lock offers a container/body engagement of up to . This design allows restricted weight transfer while the container/body remains inside the rear locks. * The slide through style rear lock offers a container/body engagement of up to . This style typically allows more extensive weight transfer while the container/body remains inside the rear locks. = Lift/dump cylinder(s) = Two configurations are typical, both suitable for either single or dual pivot designs. * The single lift/dump cylinder design reduces unit cost, retains true hooklift capabilities, but can be unstable while dumping on uneven ground. * The dual lift/dump cylinder design, whilst increasing unit cost, improves load handling stability when dumping on uneven ground. = Safety features = A series of safety valves act to ensure safe operation of the system. * Counterbalance valves, also called load holding valves or over-center valves, serve as hydraulic resistance to the actuating cylinder when the load weight is required to be held in position for a period of time. These come in two distinct configurations, both highly effective in improving load handling safety during a loss of hydraulic pressure: essentially locking the lift/dump cylinder in- place, preventing potential free fall of the load in the event of hydraulic failure. ** Remote mounted system, in which the counterbalance valve is mounted outside the cylinder. This is the more cost effective solution, but can be prone to damage. ** Integral system, in which the counterbalance valve is built directly into the main cylinder, eliminating the potential for damage by falling debris. * Jib safety valves are not a feature of all systems, but are designed to render the jib cylinder inoperable during the dump cycle. This protects the system from damage should the operator accidentally pull the wrong control lever during the dump cycle. * The hook latch covers the opening in the hook head, effectively securing the lift bar inside the hook head during transport and dump. It is designed to augment the rear lock system during transit * Some systems utilize proximity switches to indicate to the operator which part of the lift/dump cycle is current, or whether there is a fault in the system. These can me mounted in a variety of locations throughout the hoist. When activated, a red warning light and/or alarm sounds in the cab. * Below grade reach is the distance that the hook head travels below the lifting bar on the container. This distance varies between hoist systems, ranging from . A below grade reach of , or greater, improves stability when working on uneven ground. = Cab controls = Cab controls can either be operated by cable, air or electricity. Both cable and air controls, in a floor mounted lever configuration, offer additional benefits in controlling the load, by feathering the controls. * Cable controls are the least expensive, and are commonly floor mounted levers. They are generally favored in cold weather environments. * Air controls can be installed as floor mounted levers or dashboard mounted switches. * Electric controls are the most expensive and only come as dashboard mounted switches. The disadvantage of these systems, is that the control is either on or off, and thus controlling the load by feathering is not an option.  Advantages  The flexibility offered by the hydraulic hooklift hoist system offers several advantages: * Reduced licensing fees through reduced fleet size * Ground level loading and unloading * Exact positioning (dropping off) of containers * Ability to get in and out of tight spaces * Quick exchange of containers: system allows container to be lift/dropped in around 90 seconds * Ability to engage a container up to 30° off center when picking up * No cables to hook up, unhook or that could potentially break * Complete in-cab operation * Makes it possible to haul multiple containers by use of a trailer.  Disadvantages  The main disadvantages of the system are revealed on uneven ground: * If below grade reach is small, it can be difficult to set down or pick up container * Load handling stability, particularly while dumping, can be compromised at maximum dump angle. This is particularly the case in single lift/dump cylinder configurations * Container lengths are fairly inflexible, as hooklift hoists are designed to carry bodies within of the shortest recommended body  See also  * Hoist (device) * Intermodal container * Swap body  References   External links  * Diagram demonstrating different types of container arrangement: Bilitewski, B., Härdtle, G., Marek, K.

Playing style  Regmi had to change his bowling style due to his broken finger, switching from left-arm fast to slow left-arm orthodox. However, he managed to adapt to the situation and since became an effective wicket-taking option for Nepal. He was inspired by Daniel Vettori and Ashley Giles, and tried to imitate them, watching several highlights to try and learn how to get a batsman out as a spinner. His ability to take the team out of a crisis by taking crucial wickets and checking the flow of runs led to him being nicknamed \\"Crisis Man\\" by fans and teammates. He is also known for his ability as a useful partnership breaker. However, he is sometimes criticized for being poor in flat pitches. He is also a useful lower order batsman, capable of hitting big shots.

Founded in 1985 by Peter Amor. In 2002 Peter Amor's son, Vernon Amor, became managing director. History and location Wye Valley Brewery is a family business. Wye Valley Brewery was started by former Guinness brewer, Peter Amor, in the summer of 1985. After brewing for Guinness, Peter Amor decided to branch out on his own. He began brewing from the back of a pub in Canon Pyon in Herefordshire but soon moved to the old stable block of The Barrels in Hereford – Wye Valley Brewery's first pub. Meanwhile, after studying at Young's brewery in London, Peter's son, Vernon Amor, joined the brewery to help with the demands of the growing business. By 2002, the brewery had outgrown its stable block at The Barrels and Peter and Vernon were on the look-out for bigger premises. A 9-acre former cider mill in Stoke Lacy became Wye Valley Brewery's new home. Brewery The facade of Wye Valley Brewery Wye Valley Brewery is located in Herefordshire. Over 80% of its hops and raw ingredients come directly from farms within 10 miles of the brewery. = Green Brewing = Examples of Wye Valley Brewery's green brewhouse include using water vapour, created during the brewhouse boil, to heat water to clean its casks; and the roof and ground-mounted solar panels covering the equivalent of more than six tennis courts, providing over 41% of the brewery's total electricity. Beers = Core Range = Wye Valley Brewery's flagship beer is Butty Bach, which is a Welsh term meaning ‘little friend’. This 4.5% smooth, full-bodied, premium ale is burnished gold in colour, and has been crowned ‘Beer of the Festival’ at the Great Welsh Beer Festival on three occasions. Alongside this: * HPA (Hereford Pale Ale) a 4.0% is the straw- coloured ale with a citrusy aroma. * The Hopfather, a 3.9% smooth red ale featuring tropical citrus and grapefruit flavours. * Golden Ale, a 4.2% a light gold coloured ale brewed using Fuggles and Goldings hops. * Wholesome Stout, a 4.6% dark, full-bodied beer boasting roasted coffee notes and a dry, bitter finish. * Wye Valley Bitter, a 3.7% chestnut coloured ale, with a malty flavour and a clean bitter finish. In addition to the core beer line, a rotation of monthly ales are also produced. =1985= In 2016, Wye Valley Brewery launched its first ever lager, ‘1985’, which has since won an international award. The premium lager is a natural extension to the brewery's range of real ales. The lager is preservative free and made using ingredients sourced within a 10-mile radius of the brewery. Locally grown Pilot hops give ‘1985’ an earthy bitterness, whilst traditional European hops provide a delicate fruity aroma. The result is a 4.5% abv premium lager with a crisp, clean taste perfect for summer drinking. Pubs As well as supplying its beers to free houses throughout the West Midlands, South-West and South Wales, the brewery has 8 of its own pubs, building on one of its core principles – bringing the pub to the heart of the community. = The Barrels = The Barrels is an 18th Century coaching inn that is formed partly from the old city wall and is one of the last multi-roomed pubs in Hereford. The Barrels was the brewery's home for many years. = The Black Star = With a garden overlooking the canal and just a short walk from the canal basin and Stourport town centre, The Black Star reopened as a Wye Valley Brewery pub in October 2014. = The Britannia = Just a short walk from the centre of Hereford, The Britannia has a large beer garden and recently refurbished bar. = The Chequers = Located in the historic market town, Leominster, The Chequers is a timber-framed inn, and Wye Valley Brewery's oldest pub, thanks to its 16th Century origins. = The Morgan = Situated just up the road in Malvern, the Morgan Motor Company was originally based in Stoke Lacy – next door to the brewery's current home. = The Pelican = The Pelican Inn is a historic real-ale pub located between Gloucester Cathedral and Kingsholm rugby stadium. As one of Gloucester's oldest pubs, its history can be traced back to 1679.

It consists of a group of rock outcrops on the edge of the Nadab floodplain where there are several natural shelters that have a collection of Aboriginal rock paintings, some of which are many thousands of years old. The art depicts certain creation ancestors as well as animals from the area such as barramundi, catfish, mullet, goannas, long-necked turtles, pig-nosed turtles, rock ringtail possums, and wallabies. From the top of Ubirr rock there is a panoramic view of the floodplains and escarpments. Ubirr is approximately 40 km from Jabiru along a sealed road. The road is low-lying, so access can be restricted during periods of heavy rain. A short walk from the car park takes visitors past the main art sites to the foot of Ubirr Rock. The rock faces at Ubirr have been continuously painted and repainted since 40,000 BCE. Most paintings there were created about 2000 years ago. Some have been repainted right up to modern times. There are three main galleries of art accessible to visitors. National Park rangers, many of them Indigenous, give talks at all of these sites.  Main gallery  The main gallery is perhaps the most photographed, and contains many examples of \\"X-ray art\\". Also in the main gallery can be seen paintings of white men with their hands on hips, and, high up, Mimi spirits, who are so thin that they can slip in and out of cracks in the rock. It is a puzzle how the artists managed to reach these bits of rock to paint the Mimi spirits. The local explanation is that the Mimi spirits painted the pictures themselves, and brought the rock down to ground level to do so. At the northern end of the main gallery can be seen a painting of a thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, which has been extinct in the area for about 2000 years, and attests to the antiquity of the paintings. Rainbow Serpent Gallery This is the most sacred site at Ubirr, and is traditionally a women- only site, although this rule is relaxed for non-indigenous tourists. This is the spot visited by the Rainbow Serpent or \\"Garranga'rreli\\", during her path across the top end of Australia, during the Dreaming. As she crossed the land, she \\"sang\\" the rocks, plants, animals, and people into existence. This path, or songline, is still a sacred path to the indigenous people who live in northern Australia. 1800px Panorama from Ubirr Gallery Image:Ubirr_Kakadu_National_Park_Australia.jpgUbirr Image:Aboriginal_Art_Australia(6).jpg Image:Aboriginal_Art_Australia.jpg See also * Kakadu National Park * Flora of Kakadu National Park * Protected areas of the Northern Territory * Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu plum) * Indigenous Australians Footnotes External links *Aboriginal Art Learn more about Aboriginal culture in Kakadu *18 panoramics and paintings by Renaud *Google Map Map of Kakadu National Park including art sites Category:Landforms of the Northern Territory Category:Rock formations of the Northern Territory Category:Tourist attractions in the Northern Territory Category:Kakadu National Park Category:Rock art in Australia ","title":"Ubirr"},{"id":"9477942","text":"Spring Township is one of nine townships in Boone County, Illinois, USA.

History The present St. Anthony’s Higher Secondary school began as an orphanage in 1901 by the Salvatorian Fathers. Fr. Winkler SDS was the first director of the Orphanage. It was converted into a school in 1915 by the Jesuits. Fr. JU Lambergh SJ was the first Jesuit Director of the Orphanage and School. In the same year Bro Leo Brisson CSC became the Director. In 1922 when the Salesians first came to North East India, the orphanage and the school were handed over to them. Fr. Bonardi SDB was the first Salesian to take over charge as headmaster. In 1928, Fr. Bacchiarello, was appointed Headmaster. Fr. J. Bacchiarello separated the Orphanage from the School. A separate school called Don Bosco Industrial School was also opened and it was placed under the then parish priest Fr. Vendrame SDB. The school received its recognition from the authorities on 19 August 1932. The school had students of theology as teachers till 1933. By 1933 all the students of theology were exempted from this extra activity. Fr. Joseph Bacchierello SDB started St. Anthony’s College in the year 1934. It began with the arts section and then a teacher’s training school. Fr. Bacchierello was succeeded by Fr. Ricaldone in 1935. Fr. Ricaldone put up the ground floor of the School building, which during the Second World War, was occupied by the Military. During those years, the school and the college functioned on shift basis. In 1940 Fr. Noel Joseph Kenny SDB joined the college as an English Professor. He was later appointed as warden of the hostel and the vice principal of the college. In 1943 and in 1959 Fr. Kenny was given additional charge of looking after the school. After World War II, the school was shifted to the present junior school section in Don Bosco Complex and the college fully occupied the new building. Thus St. Anthony's High School got its independent existence from the college 1946 with Fr. Kenny as its Headmaster. In 1961 Fr. Kenny handed over charge to Fr. John Odey. After the three years of 1963 to 1966 Fr. Tarcicius Resto Phanrang handed over the school to Fr. Abraham Alangimattathil. On his appointment as the Bishop of Kohima-Imphal Fr. Henry Lionel took over as Headmaster. In 1971, Fr. KV George became Headmaster. During his time the school made rapid progress in sports and games and won the Subrato Cup. In 1981 Fr. Stephen Mavely took over as Headmaster of the School and began the construction of the Don Bosco mini Stadium. In 1986 Rev. Fr. Louis Arimpoor was appointed the Headmaster in place of Fr. Stephen Mavely who moved down to St. Anthony’s College as Principal. Fr. Sebastian Palatty was appointed Headmaster on 10 April 1990. From 1992 the St. Anthony’s Junior School was given a separate identity in the present Anton Hall. In the meantime the construction of the New St. Anthony's Higher Secondary School was begun by the province in the Old College site. In February 1995 the St. Anthony’s junior school was amalgamated into the High school. In 1996 the school opted for Plus II Science Stream under the Meghalaya Board of School Education. In February 1997, the entire school was shifted to the new building of St. Anthony’s Higher Secondary School, after it was blessed on 17 March 1997, by Archbishop Tarcisius Phanrang Resto SDB and Bishop Abraham Alangimattil SDB, both former headmasters. The new school building was inaugurated by Shri MM Jacob, the then Governor of Meghalaya on 20 March 1997 in the presence of Fr. Dominic Jala the then provincial. Thus, St. Anthony’s Higher Secondary School became an activity of the Salesian Community of Salesian Training Centre. Fr. Sebastian Palatty SDB handed over the keys to Fr. Joseph Anikuzhikattil SDB as the principal, Secretary and vice rector of the unified Higher Secondary School and Salesian Training Centre on 7 April 1977. In August 1998 Fr. LB Anthony went to London, England, for a year of study and Fr. T.O. Jose was appointed the Rector. Fr. John Paramkamalil SDB took over charge of the school on 8 October 1998 and when Fr. TO Jose went for further studies, Fr. Joseph Almeida SDB took charge as Rector on 30 June 1999. As St. Anthony’s Higher Secondary school opened Commerce Stream on 1 March 2000, the Junior School, consisting of Nursery to class three was shifted to Don Bosco Technical School with Fr. Marius Thongnibah as Headmaster. With the opening of commerce stream St. Anthony’s Higher Secondary Section became co- education at the Higher Secondary level. On 17 January 2001, Fr. Thomas Kunnappallil was appointed Rector. On completion of his term on 05.05.2004 Fr. Joseph Parippil was appointed Rector. When father parippil went for treatment on 08.05.2006, Fr. Thomas Edamattathu took charge as the Rector and Bro. Albert Longley Dkhar was appointed as Principal from December 2006. He is the first Salesian Brother to take up an assignment as principal of St Anthony’s Higher Secondary School. On 6 June 2009 Fr. Joseph Anikuzhikattil SDB took charge as Rector at Salesian Training Centre. In May 2010, the school began also the Arts stream at plus two levels. In June 2010 Fr. Rajendran Kuttinadar George was appointed the Principal. Presently Fr. Bernard Grace and Fr. Surjit Tigga is appointed as principal and Vice Principal.

Completion is similar to localization, and together they are among the most basic tools in analysing commutative rings. Complete commutative rings have a simpler structure than general ones, and Hensel's lemma applies to them. In algebraic geometry, a completion of a ring of functions R on a space X concentrates on a formal neighborhood of a point of X: heuristically, this is a neighborhood so small that all Taylor series centered at the point are convergent. An algebraic completion is constructed in a manner analogous to completion of a metric space with Cauchy sequences, and agrees with it in case R has a metric given by a non-Archimedean absolute value.  General construction  Suppose that E is an abelian group with a descending filtration : E = F^0 E \\\\supset F^1 E \\\\supset F^2 E \\\\supset \\\\cdots \\\\, of subgroups. One then defines the completion (with respect to the filtration) as the inverse limit: : \\\\widehat{E}=\\\\varprojlim (E/F^n E). \\\\, This is again an abelian group. Usually E is an additive abelian group. If E has additional algebraic structure compatible with the filtration, for instance E is a filtered ring, a filtered module, or a filtered vector space, then its completion is again an object with the same structure that is complete in the topology determined by the filtration. This construction may be applied both to commutative and noncommutative rings. As may be expected, when the intersection of the F^i E equals zero, this produces a complete topological ring.  Krull topology  In commutative algebra, the filtration on a commutative ring R by the powers of a proper ideal I determines the Krull topology (after Wolfgang Krull) or I-adic topology on R. The case of a maximal ideal I=\\\\mathfrak{m} is especially important, for example the distinguished maximal ideal of a valuation ring. The basis of open neighbourhoods of 0 in R is given by the powers In, which are nested and form a descending filtration on R: : F^0 R = R\\\\supset I\\\\supset I^2\\\\supset\\\\cdots, \\\\quad F^n R = I^n. (Open neighborhoods of any r ∈ R are given by cosets r + In.) The completion is the inverse limit of the factor rings, : \\\\widehat{R}_I=\\\\varprojlim (R/I^n) pronounced \\"R I hat\\". The kernel of the canonical map from the ring to its completion is the intersection of the powers of I. Thus is injective if and only if this intersection reduces to the zero element of the ring; by the Krull intersection theorem, this is the case for any commutative Noetherian ring which is either an integral domain or a local ring. There is a related topology on R-modules, also called Krull or I-adic topology. A basis of open neighborhoods of a module M is given by the sets of the form :x + I^n M \\\\quad\\\\text{for }x\\\\in M. The completion of an R-module M is the inverse limit of the quotients : \\\\widehat{M}_I=\\\\varprojlim (M/I^n M). This procedure converts any module over R into a complete topological module over \\\\widehat{R}_I.  Examples  * The ring of p-adic integers \\\\Z_p is obtained by completing the ring \\\\Z of integers at the ideal (p). * Let R = K[x1,...,xn] be the polynomial ring in n variables over a field K and \\\\mathfrak{m}=(x_1,\\\\ldots,x_n) be the maximal ideal generated by the variables. Then the completion \\\\widehat{R}_{\\\\mathfrak{m}} is the ring K'x1,...,xn of formal power series in n variables over K. * Given a noetherian ring R and an ideal I = (f_1,\\\\ldots, f_n), the I-adic completion of R is an image of a formal power series ring, specifically, the image of the surjection ::\\\\begin{cases} Rx_1, \\\\ldots, x_n \\\\to \\\\widehat{R}_I  x_i \\\\mapsto f_i \\\\end{cases} :The kernel is the ideal (x_1 - f_1, \\\\ldots, x_n - f_n). Completions can also be used to analyze the local structure of singularities of a scheme. For example, the affine schemes associated to \\\\Complex[x,y]/(xy) and the nodal cubic plane curve \\\\Complex[x,y]/(y^2 - x^2(1+x)) have similar looking singularities at the origin when viewing their graphs (both look like a plus sign). Notice that in the second case, any Zariski neighborhood of the origin is still an irreducible curve. If we use completions, then we are looking at a \\"small enough\\" neighborhood where the node has two components. Taking the localizations of these rings along the ideal (x,y) and completing gives \\\\Complexx,y/(xy) and \\\\Complexx,y/((y+u)(y-u)) respectively, where u is the formal square root of x^2(1+x) in \\\\Complexx,y. More explicitly, the power series: :u = x\\\\sqrt{1+x} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^n(2n)!}{(1-2n)(n!)^2(4^n)}x^{n+1}. Since both rings are given by the intersection of two ideals generated by a homogeneous degree 1 polynomial, we can see algebraically that the singularities \\"look\\" the same. This is because such a scheme is the union of two non-equal linear subspaces of the affine plane.  Properties  1\\\\. The completion is a functorial operation: a continuous map f: R → S of topological rings gives rise to a map of their completions, : \\\\widehat{f}: \\\\widehat{R}\\\\to\\\\widehat{S}. Moreover, if M and N are two modules over the same topological ring R and f: M → N is a continuous module map then f uniquely extends to the map of the completions: : \\\\widehat{f}: \\\\widehat{M}\\\\to\\\\widehat{N}, where \\\\widehat{M},\\\\widehat{N} are modules over \\\\widehat{R}. 2\\\\. The completion of a Noetherian ring R is a flat module over R. 3\\\\. The completion of a finitely generated module M over a Noetherian ring R can be obtained by extension of scalars: : \\\\widehat{M}=M\\\\otimes_R \\\\widehat{R}. Together with the previous property, this implies that the functor of completion on finitely generated R-modules is exact: it preserves short exact sequences. In particular, taking quotients of rings commutes with completion, meaning that for any quotient R-algebra R / I, there is an isomorphism :\\\\widehat{R / I} \\\\cong \\\\widehat R / \\\\widehat I. 4\\\\. Cohen structure theorem (equicharacteristic case). Let R be a complete local Noetherian commutative ring with maximal ideal \\\\mathfrak{m} and residue field K. If R contains a field, then : R\\\\simeq Kx_1,\\\\ldots,x_n/I for some n and some ideal I (Eisenbud, Theorem 7.7).

He also was a central figure in the meetings with evangelicals that led to the producing of the Adventist theological book, Questions on Doctrine. Life Froom studied at Pacific Union College and Walla Walla College (now Walla Walla University), before graduating from Washington Training Center, now Washington Adventist University. Froom was the first associate secretary of the General Conference Ministerial Association from 1926 to 1950. He was also the founding editor of Ministry Magazine. From 1950 until his retirement in 1958 he was a field secretary of the General Conference assigned to research and writing. He was considered to be the leading historian and apologist of the church at the time. He was part of the developments in the ministerial institutes during the 1920s, emphasizing the Holy Spirit as a person, rather than a divine influence, and authoring the first book in the church on the Holy Spirit as the Comforter. Publications Froom is best known for his apologetic writings and his attempts to help non-Adventists understand his own denomination. The most famous resulted in the publication of Questions on Doctrine in 1957. =The Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers= His best known work was the Prophetic Faith of Our Fathers consists of four volumes published from 1946 to 1954 (III 1946, II 1948, I 1950, IV 1954), and covers the Christian Era, are the result of more than sixteen years of intensive research including three extensive trips to Europe as well as in America. This work analyzes the understanding of Bible Prophecy by Christian theologians and scholars beginning in the 1st century AD to the late 19th century. Critical reception to The Prophetic Faith Of Our Fathers  In this work Froom argued that the \\"historicist\\" interpretation of Bible prophecy had been the earliest and most extensively used throughout history, and that other schemes were not only novelties in comparison but had emerged as the result of attempts to deflect the condemnation of the Roman Catholic Church which typically accompanied historicist exposition. Froom spent over 20 years compiling a collection of documentation which numbered over 1,000 works. Each volume of Froom’s work has a bibliography which typically runs to over 30 pages and cites hundreds of sources. Although largely substantiating the Adventist understanding of prophecy (which is historicist in nature), the work received some favorable reviews from non-Adventist scholars. When published, the first volume was praised for its value for money, the scope of its research, and its documentation. Another contemporary review of the first volume noted \\"An astounding amount of reading, traveling, compilation, and patient research has gone into the preparation of this book\\", characterizing it as \\"a rich summary of an enormous lot of materials\\". An early review of the second volume described it as \\"a quarry of information on the subject which will be useful to scholars in many fields\\", though it was noted that \\"The historical picture is curiously distorted\\" due to the Adventist focus on specific prophetic interpretations. This limited focus is a commonly found criticism of the work. A 1952 review of the first two volumes complimented their breadth of research, but lamented \\"The scope of the work is seriously delimited, however\\". Despite criticism of the work's limited focus, the reviewer also noted \\"Specialists can find here a wealth of material\\", and praised the care with which the research had been undertaken and presented. In a review of the first volume, the same author spoke highly of the work's contribution to scholarship, though again criticizing its narrow focus. Early reviews noted Froom's skill as a historian, and predicted that the work would become recognized as a standard reference on the subject. In recent years Froom's work is still praised for its extensive review and analysis of the history of prophetic interpretation, and is referred to as the classic work on the subject by theological scholars (as well as by secular scholars). Ernest R. Sandeen, in commenting on this \\"monumental\\" work, nonetheless drew attention to the \\"pitfalls\\" facing those who follow \\"Froom's guidance uncritically\\". While \\"useful as a reference work [and] astonishingly accurate\\", it is \\"virtually without historical merit when Froom lifts his eyes above the level of the catalog of the British Museum\\".Ernest R.

Definitions  The term rural can be defined as \\"the comprehensive, nonspecific word referring to life on the farm or country\\", essentially the opposite of urban, and usually at a great distance from the nearest city center or metropolitan area. The word land is commonly known as \\"ground considered as property\\" or \\"the solid part of the earth's surface not covered by water\\". Sales is the term used for the exchange of property for an agreed sum. The combination of the three words rural land sales is commonly used in real estate when referring to the sale or acquisition of just land located in these rural areas, not usually classified as real property, since it does not contain a home, or other type of buildings.  Application  In the United States, the purchase of rural land or raw acreage is generally for investment purposes, although some buyers intend to build a home and reside there. Often without standard utility services provided by a metropolitan municipality readily available, individuals have the responsibility to install methods of achieving a regulated standard of living. These methods, which include traditional and modern alternative methods are regulated by various legal structures to ensure their safety to the environment and neighboring residents. These may include: * Drilled and dug wells, as well as groundwater * Oil tanks and propane * Disposal fields and septic tanks * Wind and solar power, as well as secondary gasoline generators * Wood fire heating In order for a large corporation to build an establishment, they must first be approved by the rural municipality that governs the area, which often also include town hall meetings to gain the opinion and favor or local residents for the project. Most often, these projects bring with them economic benefits invaluable to struggling rural areas whose demographics are shifting and the traditional forms of income are faltering. In certain cases, grazing rights are assigned to neighboring ranchers, so that they may continue to utilize the property for livestock grazing. Grazing rights may be appealed by land owners and upon approval must install fencing along the perimeter of the property to enclose the area. = Land auction = A method of performing real estate transactions is through auctions. Most often performed in the context of tax sales held by the municipality in the intent of paying outstanding land taxes on particular pieces of property. These are published in local newspapers, and since the emergence of the Internet, the visibility of rural land sales has been made accessible for public view. They have been popularized through auction websites, such as eBay, that host rural land auctions.

A lifelong member of the Indian National Congress, he was a dedicated follower of Mahatma Gandhi (popularly known as Gandhiji), Jawaharlal Nehru, and Vinoba Bhave. Early life Ram Prakash was born in 1909 to Lala Acchru Mal Gupta, a food grain merchant and Smt. Jamna Devi Gupta in Basti Danishmanda, Jalandhar in the state of Punjab in India. Ram Prakash grew up in a small, spiritually- oriented, middle-class family (with two brothers Budhu Mal and Gopi Chand). Since his early years he was deeply affected by the social, economical, and political conditions in colonial India which was then under British occupation. Ram Prakash was a good student and completed a Bachelors in Arts degree from Jalandhar (Punjab). In those days, it was rare for children from rural families to study beyond matriculation, let alone get an undergraduate degree. His advanced education and desire for learning helped him gain a sound understanding of national and global affairs, a passion that he sustained till his last days. Married life As was typical in India in the early 1900s, at the age of 16 Ram Prakash married Chanan Devi. All accounts indicate that it was a happy relationship from the beginning. The two had ten children, of which two died in infancy: Sat Pal Gupta, Sudarshan Gupta, Savitri Gupta, Surinder Kumar Gupta, Yash Pal Gupta, Usha Gupta, Mahinder Pal Gupta, and Asha Gupta. Professional life Ram Prakash started his professional career early when he started working part-time at his father's food grain business. He was a quick learner and was quite successful in the business. After completing his graduation he became an apprentice with an older relative in a business that sold books and other educational material. After about a year, he started his own business selling books and educational material in his village, and soon moved into a much larger facility where he remained for the rest of his professional life. Though hard working and professionally successful, Ram Prakash was not interested in a business career. His true calling, like so many other young Indians at that time, was in the political and social sphere. Early political life After completing his undergraduate studies in 1935 at the age of 26, Ram Prakash joined the Indian National Congress. This was a time of intense political and social activity in India. Jawaharlal Nehru who later become the first prime minister of India had become a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress which was demanding and fighting for complete political independence from the British occupation. This was also a time when Mahatma Gandhi briefly resigned from the Indian National Congress, Subhash Bose (popularly referred to as 'Netaji') had strong philosophical clashes with Mahatma Gandhi, and the struggle for independence became much stronger than in the past. From 1935 to 1947 when India finally got independence, Ram Prakash was one of the most active political and social leaders in the Punjab chapter of the Indian National Congress. During this time, he participated in and led many protests and demonstrations against the British occupation. Following the footsteps of many other political leaders of the time, he always wore traditional Indian clothing (kurta pajama) with a Nehru-style hat. His simplicity and activism made him a popular leader with the local populace and the regional British administration continuously sought to arrest him. Later political life Ram Prakash continued to serve the Punjab chapter of the Indian National Congress under Nehru's leadership after independence. He served as the treasurer for a Widowed Women Rehabilitation Center for many years when Nehru was the President of the Center. In the late 1940s and early 1950s he came under the influence of Vinobha Bhave, a popular social activist who became popular for his Bhoodan ('land donation') movement. When Vinoba Bhave launched the Bhoodan movement in 1951, Ram Prakash joined him on his famous 1000 mile walk across Bihar, a state in central India. His experiences during this time left his deeply dissatisfied with the political and social milieu of the country. Though he remained active in local social projects for many years, it was evident that he did not believe the dreams of many young freedom fighters like him were going to come true. Last days Ram Prakash spent the last few years of his life in Chandigarh, India. He died there in 2002.

''' Born in Wichita, Kansas, Dunham studied at the East–West Center and at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, where she attained a bachelor of arts degree in anthropology (1967),The University of Hawaii at Manoa Department of Anthropology says Ann Dunham received a B.A. in anthropology in August 1967 and contemporaneous correspondence in 1966 and 1967 between S. Ann Soetoro and the INS makes repeated references to her obtaining a BA in anthropology in 1967. and later received master of arts (1974) and PhD (1992) degrees, also in anthropology. reprinted by: * She also attended the University of Washington in Seattle from 1961 to 1962. Interested in craftsmanship, weaving, and the role of women in cottage industries, Dunham's research focused on women's work on the island of Java and blacksmithing in Indonesia. To address the problem of poverty in rural villages, she created microcredit programs while working as a consultant for the United States Agency for International Development. Dunham was also employed by the Ford Foundation in Jakarta and she consulted with the Asian Development Bank in Gujranwala, Pakistan. Towards the latter part of her life, she worked with Bank Rakyat Indonesia, where she helped apply her research to the largest microfinance program in the world. After her son was elected President, interest renewed in Dunham's work: the University of Hawaii held a symposium about her research; an exhibition of Dunham's Indonesian batik textile collection toured the United States; and in December 2009, Duke University Press published Surviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia, a book based on Dunham's original 1992 dissertation. Janny Scott, an author and former New York Times reporter, published a biography about Ann Dunham's life titled A Singular Woman in 2011. Posthumous interest has also led to the creation of The Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, as well as the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, intended to fund students associated with the East–West Center (EWC) in Honolulu, Hawaii. In an interview, Barack Obama referred to his mother as \\"the dominant figure in my formative years ... The values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how I go about the world of politics.\\" Early life Stanley Ann Dunham was born on November 29, 1942, at Ascension Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita, Kansas, the only child of Madelyn Lee Payne and Stanley Armour Dunham. She was of predominantly English ancestry, with some Scottish, Welsh, Irish, German and Swiss.  * * Wild Bill Hickok is her sixth cousin, five times removed.Boston Genealogical Society Confirms Obama and \\"Wild Bill\\" Hickok Are Cousins New England Historic Genealogical Society, July 30, 2008. Ancestry.com announced on July 30, 2012, after using a combination of old documents and yDNA analysis, that Dunham's mother was descended from African John Punch, who was an indentured servant/slave in seventeenth-century colonial Virginia. Her parents were born in Kansas and met in Wichita, where they married on May 5, 1940. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, her father joined the United States Army and her mother worked at a Boeing plant in Wichita. According to Dunham, she was named after her father because he wanted a son, though her relatives doubt this story and her maternal uncle recalled that her mother named Dunham after her favorite actress Bette Davis' character in the film In This Our Life because she thought Stanley, as a girl's name, sounded sophisticated.Scott (2011), pp. 41–42. Maraniss (2012), p. 68 > A woman named Stanley: \\"Madelyn thought that was the height of > sophistication!\\" recalled her brother Charles Payne, and the notion of > giving her baby girl that name took hold. The coincidence that her husband > was also Stanley only deepened the association. As a child and teenager she was known as Stanley. Other children teased her about her name but she used it through high school, \\"apologizing for it each time she introduced herself in a new town\\". By the time Dunham began attending college, she was known by her middle name, Ann, instead. After World War II, Dunham's family moved from Wichita to California while her father attended the University of California, Berkeley. In 1948, they moved to Ponca City, Oklahoma, and from there to Vernon, Texas, and then to El Dorado, Kansas.Jones 2007. See also: Also: In 1955, the family moved to Seattle, Washington, where her father was employed as a furniture salesman and her mother worked as vice president of a bank. They lived in an apartment complex in the Wedgwood neighborhood where she attended Nathan Eckstein Junior High School. In 1956, Dunham's family moved to Mercer Island, an Eastside suburb of Seattle. Dunham's parents wanted their 13-year-old daughter to attend the newly opened Mercer Island High School. At the school, teachers Val Foubert and Jim Wichterman taught the importance of challenging social norms and questioning authority to the young Dunham, and she took the lessons to heart: \\"She felt she didn't need to date or marry or have children.\\" One classmate remembered her as \\"intellectually way more mature than we were and a little bit ahead of her time, in an off-center way\\", and a high school friend described her as knowledgeable and progressive: \\"If you were concerned about something going wrong in the world, Stanley would know about it first. We were liberals before we knew what liberals were.\\" Another called her \\"the original feminist\\". Family life and marriages Stanley Armour Dunham, Ann Dunham, Maya Soetoro and Barack Obama, mid-1970s (l to r) On August 21, 1959, Hawaii became the 50th state to be admitted into the Union. Dunham's parents sought business opportunities in the new state, and after graduating from high school in 1960, Dunham and her family moved to Honolulu. Dunham soon enrolled at the University of Hawaii at Mānoa. =First marriage= While attending a Russian language class, Dunham met Barack Obama Sr., the school's first African student. Mendell (2007), p. 27. (online) (print) At the age of 23, Obama Sr. had come to Hawaii to pursue his education, leaving behind a pregnant wife and infant son in his home town of Nyang'oma Kogelo in Kenya. Dunham and Obama Sr. were married on the Hawaiian island of Maui on February 2, 1961, despite parental opposition from both families. (online) (\\"Special Democratic Convention issue\\") (print) Dunham was three months pregnant. Obama Sr. eventually informed Dunham about his first marriage in Kenya but claimed he was divorced. Years later, she would discover this was false. Obama Sr.'s first wife, Kezia, later said she had granted her consent for him to marry a second wife, in keeping with Luo customs. On August 4, 1961, at the age of 18, Dunham gave birth to her first child, Barack Obama. Friends in the state of Washington recall her visiting with her month-old baby in 1961. Regarding the 1961 visit to Washington state: \\"Susan Blake,[Botkin] another high-school classmate, said that during a brief visit in 1961, Dunham was excited about her husband's plans to return to Kenya.\\" Regarding her enrollment at University of Washington: \\"By 1962, Dunham had returned to Seattle as a single mother, enrolling in the UW for spring quarter and living in an apartment on Capitol Hill.\\" Susan Blake [Botkin] (Stanley Ann Dunham's high school classmate)At some point, she gave her old friends the impression that she was on her way to visit her husband at Harvard (where he would not enroll until the fall of 1962). See Maraniss August 22, 2008. She studied at the University of Washington from September 1961 to June 1962, and lived as a single mother in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle with her son while her husband continued his studies in Hawaii.

Both Anna Obama and Joseph Toutonghi were listed as residing at the same address, in the Seattle Reverse Directory, 1961–1962. See: When Obama Sr. graduated from the University of Hawaii in June 1962, he was offered a scholarship to study in New York City,One source says the scholarship was for New York University: ; others say it was for the New School for Social Research, e.g.: but declined it, preferring to attend the more prestigious Harvard University. He left for Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he would begin graduate study at Harvard in the fall of 1962. Dunham returned to Honolulu and resumed her undergraduate education at the University of Hawaii with the spring semester in January 1963. During this time, her parents helped her raise the young Obama. Dunham filed for divorce in January 1964, which Obama Sr. did not contest. In December 1964, Obama Sr. married Ruth Baker, a Jewish American of Lithuanian heritage; they were separated in 1971 and divorced in 1973 after having two sons. In 1965, Obama Sr. received a MA in economics from Harvard. In 1971, he came to Hawaii for a month and visited his son Barack, then 10 years old; it was the last time he would see his son, and their only major personal interaction. In 1982, Obama Sr. was killed in a car accident. =Second marriage= It was at the East–West Center that Dunham met Lolo Soetoro, a Javanese surveyor who had come to Honolulu in September 1962 on an East–West Center grant to study geography at the University of Hawaii. Soetoro graduated from the University of Hawaii with an MA in geography in June 1964. In 1965, Soetoro and Dunham were married in Hawaii, and in 1966, Soetoro returned to Indonesia. Dunham graduated from the University of Hawaii with a B.A. in anthropology on August 6, 1967, and moved in October the same year with her six-year-old son to Jakarta, Indonesia, to rejoin her husband. In Indonesia, Soetoro worked first as a low-paid topographical surveyor for the Indonesian government, and later in the government relations office of Union Oil Company. Google Translate's English translation The family first lived at 16 Kyai Haji Ramli Tengah Street in a newly built neighborhood in the Menteng Dalam administrative village of the Tebet subdistrict in South Jakarta for two and a half years, with her son attending the nearby Indonesian-language Santo Fransiskus Asisi (St. Francis of Assisi) Catholic School for 1st, 2nd, and part of 3rd grade, then in 1970 moved two miles north to 22 Taman Amir Hamzah Street in the Matraman Dalam neighborhood in the Pegangsaan administrative village of the Menteng subdistrict in Central Jakarta, with her son attending the Indonesian-language government-run Besuki School one and half miles east in the exclusive Menteng administrative village of the Menteng subdistrict for part of 3rd grade and for 4th grade. On August 15, 1970, Soetoro and Dunham had a daughter, Maya Kassandra Soetoro. In Indonesia, Dunham enriched her son's education with correspondence courses in English, recordings of Mahalia Jackson, and speeches by Martin Luther King Jr. In 1971, she sent the young Obama back to Hawaii to attend Punahou School starting in 5th grade rather than having him stay in Indonesia with her. Madelyn Dunham's job at the Bank of Hawaii, where she had worked her way up over a decade from clerk to becoming one of its first two female vice presidents in 1970, helped pay the steep tuition,Mendell (2007), p. 36. with some assistance from a scholarship. A year later, in August 1972, Dunham and her daughter moved back to Hawaii to rejoin her son and begin graduate study in anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Dunham's graduate work was supported by an Asia Foundation grant from August 1972 to July 1973 and by an East–West Center Technology and Development Institute grant from August 1973 to December 1978. Dunham completed her coursework at the University of Hawaii for an M.A. in anthropology in December 1974, and after having spent three years in Hawaii, Dunham, accompanied by her daughter Maya, returned to Indonesia in 1975 to do anthropological field work. > Actually I had hoped to move to Jogja at midyear, but was unable to win a > contract release from my old school in Jakarta (they sponsored me via an > Asia Foundation grant for my first two years in Hawaii).

Her son chose not to go with them back to Indonesia, preferring to finish high school at Punahou School in Honolulu while living with his grandparents.Mendell (2007), p. 43. Lolo Soetoro and Dunham divorced on November 5, 1980; Lolo Soetoro married Erna Kustina in 1980 and had two children, a son, Yusuf Aji Soetoro (born 1981), and daughter, Rahayu Nurmaida Soetoro (born 1987). Lolo Soetoro died, age 52, on March 2, 1987, due to liver failure. Dunham was not estranged from either ex-husband and encouraged her children to feel connected to their fathers. Professional life From January 1968 to December 1969, Dunham taught English and was an assistant director of the Lembaga Persahabatan Indonesia Amerika (LIA)–the Indonesia- America Friendship Institute at 9 Teuku Umar Street in the Gondangdia administrative village of the Menteng subdistrict in Central Jakarta–which was subsidized by the United States government. From January 1970 to August 1972, Dunham taught English and was a department head and a director of the Lembaga Pendidikan dan Pengembangan Manajemen (LPPM)–the Institute of Management Education and Development at 9 Menteng Raya Street in the Kebon Sirih administrative village of the Menteng subdistrict in Central Jakarta. From 1968 to 1972, Dunham was a co-founder and active member of the Ganesha Volunteers (Indonesian Heritage Society) at the National Museum in Jakarta. From 1972 to 1975, Dunham was crafts instructor (in weaving, batik, and dye) at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu. Dunham then had a career in rural development, championing women's work and microcredit for the world's poor and worked with leaders from organizations supporting Indonesian human rights, women's rights, and grass-roots development. In March 1977, Dunham, under the supervision of agricultural economics professor Leon A. Mears, developed and taught a short lecture course at the Faculty of Economics of the University of Indonesia (FEUI) in Jakarta for staff members of BAPPENAS (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Nasional)—the Indonesian National Development Planning Agency. From June 1977 through September 1978, Dunham carried out research on village industries in the Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY)—the Yogyakarta Special Region within Central Java in Indonesia under a student grant from the East–West Center. As a weaver herself, Dunham was interested in village industries, and moved to Yogyakarta City, the center of Javanese handicrafts. In May and June 1978, Dunham was a short-term consultant in the office of the International Labour Organization (ILO) in Jakarta, writing recommendations on village industries and other non-agricultural enterprises for the Indonesian government's third five-year development plan (REPELITA III). From October 1978 to December 1980, Dunham was a rural industries consultant in Central Java on the Indonesian Ministry of Industry's Provincial Development Program (PDP I), funded by USAID in Jakarta and implemented through Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI). From January 1981 to November 1984, Dunham was the program officer for women and employment in the Ford Foundation's Southeast Asia regional office in Jakarta. While at the Ford Foundation, she developed a model of microfinance which is now the standard in Indonesia, a country that is a world leader in micro-credit systems. Peter Geithner, father of Tim Geithner (who later became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury in her son's administration), was head of the foundation's Asia grant-making at that time. From May to November 1986 and from August to November 1987, Dunham was a cottage industries development consultant for the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) under the Gujranwala Integrated Rural Development Project (GADP). The credit component of the project was implemented in the Gujranwala district of the Punjab province of Pakistan with funding from the Asian Development Bank and IFAD, with the credit component implemented through Louis Berger International, Inc. Dunham worked closely with the Lahore office of the Punjab Small Industries Corporation (PSIC). From January 1988 to 1995, Dunham was a consultant and research coordinator for Indonesia's oldest bank, Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) in Jakarta, with her work funded by USAID and the World Bank. In March 1993, Dunham was a research and policy coordinator for Women's World Banking (WWB) in New York. She helped WWB manage the Expert Group Meeting on Women and Finance in New York in January 1994, and helped the WWB take prominent roles in the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women held September 4–15, 1995 in Beijing, and in the UN regional conferences and NGO forums that preceded it. On August 9, 1992, she was awarded PhD in anthropology from the University of Hawaii, under the supervision of Prof. Alice G. Dewey, with a 1,043-page dissertationScott (2011), p. 292. titled Peasant blacksmithing in Indonesia: surviving and thriving against all odds. Anthropologist Michael Dove described the dissertation as \\"a classic, in- depth, on-the-ground anthropological study of a 1,200-year-old industry\\". According to Dove, Dunham's dissertation challenged popular perceptions regarding economically and politically marginalized groups, and countered the notions that the roots of poverty lie with the poor themselves and that cultural differences are responsible for the gap between less-developed countries and the industrialized West. According to Dove, Dunham > found that the villagers she studied in Central Java had many of the same > economic needs, beliefs and aspirations as the most capitalist of > Westerners. Village craftsmen were \\"keenly interested in profits\\", she > wrote, and entrepreneurship was \\"in plentiful supply in rural Indonesia\\", > having been \\"part of the traditional culture\\" there for a millennium. > > Based on these observations, Dr. Soetoro concluded that underdevelopment in > these communities resulted from a scarcity of capital, the allocation of > which was a matter of politics, not culture.

Dunham produced a large amount of professional papers that are held in collections of the National Anthropological Archives (NAA). Her daughter donated a collection of them that is categorized as the S. Ann Dunham papers, 1965-2013. This collection contains case studies, correspondence, field notebooks, lectures, photographs, reports, research files, research proposals, surveys, and floppy disks documenting her dissertation research on blacksmithing, as well as her professional work as a consultant for organizations such as the Ford Foundation and the Bank Raykat Indonesia (BRI). They are housed at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Her field notes have been digitized and, in 2020, Smithsonian Magazine noted that an effort had been established for a project to transcribe them.Sexton, Courtney, Help Transcribe Field Notes Penned by S. Ann Dunham, a Pioneering Anthropologist and Barack Obama’s Mother, Smithsonian Magazine, July 15, 2020 Public participation in the transcription project was announced at the same time. Illness and death In late 1994, Dunham was living and working in Indonesia. One night, during dinner at a friend's house in Jakarta, she experienced stomach pain. A visit to a local physician led to an initial diagnosis of indigestion. Dunham returned to the United States in early 1995 and was examined at the Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and diagnosed with uterine cancer. By this time, the cancer had spread to her ovaries. She moved back to Hawaii to live near her widowed mother and died on November 7, 1995, 22 days short of her 53rd birthday. Following a memorial service at the University of Hawaii, Obama and his sister spread their mother's ashes in the Pacific Ocean at Lanai Lookout on the south side of Oahu. Obama scattered the ashes of his grandmother Madelyn Dunham in the same spot on December 23, 2008, weeks after his election to the presidency. Obama talked about Dunham's death in a 30-second campaign advertisement (\\"Mother\\") arguing for health care reform. The ad featured a photograph of Dunham holding a young Obama in her arms as Obama talks about her last days worrying about expensive medical bills. The topic also came up in a 2007 speech in Santa Barbara: > I remember my mother. She was 52 years old when she died of ovarian cancer, > and you know what she was thinking about in the last months of her life? She > wasn't thinking about getting well. She wasn't thinking about coming to > terms with her own mortality. She had been diagnosed just as she was > transitioning between jobs. And she wasn't sure whether insurance was going > to cover the medical expenses because they might consider this a preexisting > condition. I remember just being heartbroken, seeing her struggle through > the paperwork and the medical bills and the insurance forms. So, I have seen > what it's like when somebody you love is suffering because of a broken > health care system. And it's wrong. It's not who we are as a people. Dunham's employer-provided health insurance covered most of the costs of her medical treatment, leaving her to pay the deductible and uncovered expenses, which came to several hundred dollars per month.Scott (2011), pp. 328–336. Her employer-provided disability insurance denied her claims for uncovered expenses because the insurance company said her cancer was a preexisting condition. Posthumous interest In September 2008, the University of Hawaii at Mānoa held a symposium about Dunham. In December 2009, Duke University Press published a version of Dunham's dissertation titled Surviving against the Odds: Village Industry in Indonesia. The book was revised and edited by Dunham's graduate advisor, Alice G. Dewey, and Nancy I. Cooper. Dunham's daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, wrote the foreword for the book. In his afterword, Boston University anthropologist Robert W. Hefner describes Dunham's research as \\"prescient\\" and her legacy as \\"relevant today for anthropology, Indonesian studies, and engaged scholarship\\". :See also: * The book was launched at the 2009 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association in Philadelphia with a special Presidential Panel on Dunham's work; The 2009 meeting was taped by C-SPAN. In 2009, an exhibition of Dunham's Javanese batik textile collection (A Lady Found a Culture in its Cloth: Barack Obama's Mother and Indonesian Batiks) toured six museums in the United States, finishing the tour at the Textile Museum of Washington, D.C., in August. Early in her life, Dunham explored her interest in the textile arts as a weaver, creating wall hangings for her own enjoyment. After moving to Indonesia, she was attracted to the striking textile art of the batik and began to collect a variety of different fabrics. In December 2010 Dunham was awarded the Bintang Jasa Utama, Indonesia's highest civilian award; the Bintang Jasa is awarded at three levels, and is presented to those individuals who have made notable civic and cultural contributions. A lengthy major biography of Dunham by former New York Times reporter Janny Scott, titled A Singular Woman, was published in 2011. The University of Hawaii Foundation has established the Ann Dunham Soetoro Endowment, which supports a faculty position housed in the Anthropology Department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, and the Ann Dunham Soetoro Graduate Fellowships, providing funding for students associated with the East–West Center (EWC) in Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2010 the Stanley Ann Dunham Scholarship was established for young women graduating from Mercer Island High School, Ann's alma mater. In its first six years the scholarship fund has awarded eleven college scholarships.Stanley Ann Dunham Scholarship Fund Website On January 1, 2012, President Obama and his family visited an exhibition of his mother's anthropological work on display at the East–West Center. Filmmaker Vivian Norris's feature length biographical film of Ann Dunham entitled Obama Mama (La mère d'Obama-French title) premiered on May 31, 2014, as part of the 40th annual Seattle International Film Festival, not far from where Dunham grew up on Mercer Island. Personal beliefs In his 1995 memoir Dreams from My Father, Barack Obama wrote, \\"My mother's confidence in needlepoint virtues depended on a faith I didn't possess... In a land [Indonesia] where fatalism remained a necessary tool for enduring hardship ... she was a lonely witness for secular humanism, a soldier for New Deal, Peace Corps, position-paper liberalism.\\" In his 2006 book The Audacity of Hope Obama wrote, \\"I was not raised in a religious household ... My mother's own experiences ... only reinforced this inherited skepticism. Her memories of the Christians who populated her youth were not fond ones ... And yet for all her professed secularism, my mother was in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I've ever known.\\" \\"Religion for her was \\"just one of the many ways—and not necessarily the best way—that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives,\\" Obama wrote: Dunham's best friend in high school, Maxine Box, said that Dunham \\"touted herself as an atheist, and it was something she'd read about and could argue. She was always challenging and arguing and comparing. She was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadn't.\\" On the other hand, Dunham's daughter, Maya Soetoro-Ng, when asked later if her mother was an atheist, said, \\"I wouldn't have called her an atheist. She was an agnostic. She basically gave us all the good books—the Bible, the Hindu Upanishads and the Buddhist scripture, the Tao Te Ching—and wanted us to recognize that everyone has something beautiful to contribute.\\" \\"Jesus, she felt, was a wonderful example. But she felt that a lot of Christians behaved in un-Christian ways.\\" In a 2007 speech, Obama contrasted the beliefs of his mother to those of her parents, and commented on her spirituality and skepticism: \\"My mother, whose parents were nonpracticing Baptists and Methodists, was one of the most spiritual souls I ever knew. But she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution.\\" Obama also described his own beliefs in relation to the religious upbringing of his mother and father: Publications     References  References  Further reading * Category:Obama family Category:American anthropologists Category:American women anthropologists Category:American women social scientists Category:American feminists Category:American humanists Category:University of Hawaii at Manoa alumni Category:University of Washington alumni Category:People from Honolulu Category:People from Mercer Island, Washington Category:People from Wichita, Kansas Category:American people of English descent Category:American people of German descent Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Scottish descent Category:American people of Swiss descent Category:American people of Welsh descent Category:American expatriates in Indonesia Category:American expatriates in Pakistan Category:Deaths from cancer in Hawaii Category:Deaths from uterine cancer Category:Mothers of Presidents of the United States Category:1942 births Category:1995 deaths Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:20th-century American scientists Category:Mercer Island High School alumni Category:20th-century anthropologists ","title":"Ann Dunham"},{"id":"9478205","text":"Maria Vasilyevna Klenova () (12 August 1898 – 6 August 1976) was a Russian and Soviet marine geologist and one of the founders of Russian marine science and contributor to the first Soviet Antarctic atlas. Klenova studied to become a professor and later on worked as a member of the Council for Antarctic Research of the USSR Academy of Sciences. During that time she spent nearly thirty years researching in the Polar Regions and become the first woman scientist to do research in Antarctica. She joined in the First Soviet Antarctic Expedition (1955–57) and worked with ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions) at Macquarie Island.  Early life  Maria Vasilyevna Klenova was born in Irkutsk, Russia in 1898. She was educated in Ekaterinburg and moved to Moscow during World War I to work in a hospital while undertaking medical studies. She travelled to Siberia to continue her medical studies during the Russian Civil War. In the early 1920s Klenova returned to Moscow and pursued a study of mineralogy. She graduated from Moscow State University in 1924. She undertook her doctoral degree under supervisors Yakov Samoilov and Vladimir Vernadsky. Career Klenova began her marine geology career in 1925 as a researcher aboard the Soviet research vessel Perseus, attached to the Floating Marine Research Institute (precursor to the present-day Nikolai M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Marine Fisheries and Oceanography) in the Barents Sea and the archipelagos of Novaya Zemlya, Spitsbergen, and Franz Josef Land. In 1933 Klenova produced the first complete seabed map of the Barents Sea. She identified and named the Barents abyssal plain (85ºN, 40ºE) after the Dutch polar explorer Willem Barentsz (or Barents) who died in 1597 on his third expedition to find the Northeast Passage. In 1949 Klenova became a senior research associate at the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology of the USSR Academy of Sciences. Her work included analyses of seabed geology in the Atlantic Ocean and the Antarctic, and in the Caspian, Barents and White Seas. In the austral summer of 1956 she traveled with a Soviet oceanographic team to map uncharted areas of the Antarctic coast. Contributions Her contributions helped to create the first Antarctic atlas, a groundbreaking four-volume work published in the Soviet Union. Klenova spent most of her time making observations on board the Russian icebreakers Ob and Lena. Her group took oceanographic measurements in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters. Along with Klenova there were seven other women on board the Ob. At that time women were rarely allowed to venture on land and had to rely on their male colleagues to collect and bring back data samples. In between these two voyages she worked at Mirny, a Russian base on the Queen Mary Coast (which is shared by Australian and Polish Research Stations). On the way home Klenova went to Macquarie Island where she became the first female scientist ever to go ashore. Her book Geologiya Moray (Geology of the sea) published in 1948 was the second textbook dedicated to marine geology. Honours The Klenova Valley (), an oceanographic valley discovered in 1981–1983 by the USSR Northern Fleet Hydrographic Expedition is named after her. Klenova Seamount, about 450 km east of Salvador, Brazil (13º01.5' S, 34º15' W), Klenova crater on Venus and Klenova Peak in AntarcticaKlenova Peak.

The play is associated with the Irish phase of Shirley's dramatic career (1637-40), and was likely performed in Dublin at the Werburgh Street Theatre. One scholar, however, has produced evidence that The Constant Maid was originally composed in the early 1630s.A. P. Riemer, \\"Shirley's Revisions and the Date of The Constant Maid,\\" Review of English Studies 17 (1966), pp. 141-8. The Constant Maid was never licensed for performance by the Master of the Revels, as it normally would have been, if staged in London. The play could hardly have been performed in London in its existing form, since the scene of the mock-king (see below) would never have made it past the censorship of the Master, Sir Henry Herbert. The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 28 April 1640, along with Shirley's St. Patrick for Ireland, and was published later that year in a quarto printed by J. Raworth for the bookseller Robert Whitaker. In 1657 the play was reissued, in a quarto along with the St. Patrick play, by the bookseller Joshua Kirton. And in 1661 The Constant Maid was reprinted, under its subtitle, and attributed to \\"T. B.\\"; the title page states that the play was performed by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre--though the inaccuracy of the attribution renders all the assertions of the title page questionable. A fourth edition appeared in 1667 as the work of \\"J. S.\\" The 1667 title page maintains that the play was \\"Acted at the new playhouse called the Nursery, in Hatton Garden,\\" reflecting a Restoration revival. Synopsis Hartwell is a gentleman who is suffering financial reverses; he is forced to dismiss his servants and shut up his house. Hartwell loves Frances; Frances's mother Bellamy, in order to test her prospective son-in-law's fidelity, pretends to be in love with him herself. Hartwell's friend Playfair advises him to accept the mother's advances -- but their conversation is overheard by Frances's Nurse. The Nurse, who wishes Frances to marry a clownish suitor called Startup, arranges for Frances and Startup to eavesdrop on the conversation between Hartwell and Bellamy. The Nurse conspires with Close, a dismissed servant of Hartwell's who now works for Startup, to smuggle Startup into Frances's bedroom that night; but Close, loyal to his former employer, divulges the plan to Hartwell. Hartwell disguises himself as Startup, and the Nurse unknowingly leads him to Frances's room. Frances recognizes him, but pretends to believe that Hartwell is Startup, and pretends likewise to be receptive to his suit. Bellamy interrupts their conversation and Hartwell leaves, with the mistaken impression that Frances loves Startup. Bellamy, testing her daughter's affections, tells Frances to surrender Hartwell to her. While Hartwell has taken Startup's place, Close has scared away the real Startup by claiming that Hartwell is pursuing him. Close and Startup and Hartwell are all apprehended by the constables of the watch; Hartwell is suspected of doing away with Startup, until Startup appears. The muddle is eventually straightened out, as is Hartwell's understanding with Frances. In the subplot, Playfair is in love with the niece of Hornet the usurer. She feigns madness and is treated by a doctor who is Playfair's cousin. Hornet is tricked into going to Court, where he is granted an audience with a pretended King; meanwhile the niece is spirited away from her uncle's custody and is married to Playfair. Like many plays of its era (including several of Shirley's), the final act of The Constant Maid features a masque -- in this case a representation of the Judgement of Paris. (Shirley would write an entire independent masque on the same subject, in his The Triumph of Beauty.)

It is located south-west of the centre of the city. The airport was built in 1962, with improvements made in 1990. Terminal 2, with an area measuring , opened in 25 September 2014. It is designed to handle 16 million passengers annually. The number of passengers reached 1 million in 2002, and jumped to 2 million by 2006. In 2016, 11.56 million passengers used the airport. History during World War II During World War II, the airport was known as Nanning Airfield and was used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign (1942–1945). It was used primarily by reconnaissance units, which operated unarmed P-38 Lightning photo-recon aircraft that flew over Japanese-held territory and obtained intelligence used by combat units. Detachments of fighter and bomber squadrons also operated occasionally from the airfield, along with being a supply point for the 2d Combat Cargo Squadron, which air- dropped supplies and munitions to ground forces on the front lines. At the end of the war, the transports also hauled men, horses and mules to the airfield. The Americans closed their facilities at the end of October 1945.Maurer, Maurer.

The lake is referred to as South Carolina's inland sea. It has a shoreline and covers nearly 110,000 acres (450 square kilometers or 173.7 square miles)Conversions: Acres to km2, 450 km2 to Square miles of rolling farmlands, former marshes, and river valley landscape. The Santee River was dammed in the 1940s to supply hydroelectric power, as part of the rural electrification efforts initiated under President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal during the Great Depression. It is one of the fifty largest lakes in the United States, whether natural or man-made reservoirs, but at current capacity it is only about a third of the area of what, if filled to capacity, would be the fifteenth largest in area. Origin Lake Marion was created by the construction of the Santee Dam in November 1941, part of the state-owned electric and water utility Santee Cooper's Hydroelectric and Navigation Project. The project also included the construction of the Pinopolis Dam (Cooper River Dam) to create Lake Moultrie, immediately downstream, and a diversion canal seven and a half miles long to connect the two. The dam at Wilson's Landing is eight miles long and has 62 Tainter gates. Despite its size, the Santee Dam creates only 1.92 megawatts of hydropower. Hydroelectric facilities at Pinopolis Dam were designed to produce the lion's share of the original scheme: currently about 128 megawatts. In 1985, as part of a large-scale rediversion and redesign, the United States Army Corps of Engineers installed the St. Stephen Dam hydro facility to recapture lost generating capacity of another 84 megawatts.http://act.americanrivers.org/site/DocServer/santee_cooper_case_study_04.pdf?docID=569 Lake Marion is fed by many tributaries, including Wyboo Creek and the Santee River, and also by numerous springs, including Eutaw Springs. The lake is named for the American Revolutionary War General Francis Marion. His former home of Pond Bluff was one of those flooded when the lake was created. Location Interstate 95 bridge over Lake Marion, Santee, SC; old bridge is fishing pier Located in five of South Carolina's counties including: Berkeley, Calhoun, Clarendon, Orangeburg, and Sumter. Public access is provided through several public boat ramps, Santee State Park, and the Santee National Wildlife Refuge. Interstate 95 crosses the man-made lake near the Town of Santee. Lake Marion is home to several communities and camps for youth and students. Religious groups, fraternal organizations, and rowing teams come to Lake Marion each spring and summer due to its sheltered location, calm waters, and temperate climate. Wildlife The state fishing record for Largemouth Bass (16.2 Ibs) was set at this lake.Freshwater Fish Records for South Carolina Other fish that abound are striped bass, white perch, white bass, crappie, channel catfish, Arkansas blue catfish, Shellcrackers, bream and Chain pickerel (Jack). Other wildlife that call Lake Marion home include deer, fox, squirrel, turtle, dove, wild turkey, alligator and various species of duck, hawk, eagle, egret and osprey. Conditions vary from shallow swamps and blackwater ponds to vast open water with a multitude of underwater structures. The area was not completely cleared when Lake Marion was created. As a result, there are thousands of stumps, standing dead tree trunks and live cypress trees.

The story is loosely based on the protest activity at the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. The film premiered on May 22, 2008 at the Seattle International Film Festival. Plot The film depicts the protest in 1999, as thousands of activists arrive in Seattle, Washington in masses to protest the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999. Protesters believe the World Trade Organization contributes to widening the wealth gap between the rich and the poor, while the WTO claims to be fixing the disparity and decreasing world hunger, disease, and death. The movie takes an in-depth look at several fictional characters during those five days in 1999 as demonstrators protested the meeting of the WTO in Seattle's streets. The movie portrays conflicts between the peaceful protesters and people committing property destruction whose actions were widely covered by the media. Although the protest began peacefully with a goal of stopping the WTO talks, police began teargassing the crowd after it refused to clear the streets and the situation escalated into a full-scale riot and a State of Emergency that pitted protesters against the Seattle Police Department and the Washington National Guard. Cast Though the film is based on actual events, the characters are fictional. Filming locations * Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada ** University of British Columbia, Point Grey Campus ** Granville Square ** Corner of Hastings and Hornby ** Corner of Hastings and Howe Leone and L2 ** Foot of Vancouver Public Library ** Fraser Street, between 41st and 49th Avenues * Seattle, Washington Reception The film received mixed reviews from critics, earning a 56% positive rating from numerous reviews on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, . The critical consensus was that the film, though \\"Well intentioned and passionate, this docu-drama about the 1999 WTO protests is heavier on politics than character development\\". New York Magazine called the film \\"a triumph\\", while Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert gave the film 3 out of 4 stars and described it as \\"not quite a documentary and not quite a drama, but interesting all the same\\" and compared it to past political films like Medium Cool. According to EW.com, the film \\"sounds like a bad TV movie: a drama based on the protests that halted the 1999 World Trade Organization summit in Seattle. Yet Stuart Townsend re-creates it all with stunning passion and skill\\". The film also received positive reviews from The Hollywood Reporter and Variety. Despite director Stuart Townsend's stated intention of portraying the events of protest accurately, the film was criticized by anarchist collective CrimethInc. for what they saw as its sensationalistic portrayal of events. In a pamphlet titled \\"And What About Tomorrow?\\", the collective allege that the protests were characterized in the film as an isolated spontaneous uprising in which a \\"small fringe group\\" of black bloc anarchists \\"stole the show\\", whereas CrimethInc. contend that \\"anarchists were involved in all different aspects of the protests\\" including nonviolent organization and Food Not Bombs, and credit the adoption of anarchist direct action tactics with the success of the uprising. A review published by Anarkismo praised the film as \\"clearly well-researched\\", citing the pacing and general narrative as quite accurate, but criticized the presentation of anarchist politics as one-dimensional and a caricature.

It is the traditional Country of the Gun-djeihmi speaking people and according to Traditional Owners, was shaped by Ancestral beings in the creation period of the Dreaming (Chaloupka 1982 p. 6). It was included on the World Heritage Register. Kakadu National Park is included on UNESCO the World Heritage List due to its exceptional natural and cultural values. Europeans were first in the area of Noulangie Rock in about 1845, after Ludwig Leichhardt’s explorations passed through the area. By the 1880s, European buffalo and buffalo shooters had moved into the area and local Traditional Owners joined their shooting parties. Traditional owners told the buffalo shooters about the Dreaming stories at Burrungui and the many names of all the natural features of the landscapes. Chaloupka argues that the Europeans couldn’t remember all of the names, and called ‘Nourlangie’, a confused pronunciation of the name of the area generally called ‘Nawulandja’. Rock art at Burrungui (Nourlangie) There are a number of shelters in amongst this large outcrop. The shelters contain amazing paintings that represent the Aboriginal Dreaming, with depictions of Namandi spirits, both male and female figures and one with six fingers on each hand. Many paintings in the Burrungui area also depict European items and introduced animals. Pigments are mostly of yellow, white and red ochre, with red ochre being used as a chalk to draw on the rock surface in some places. Early art at the site is evidenced in handprints on the rock in red pigment, or gars being flung on the rock. The paintings at Burrungui are in the Mimi and x-ray style, with Mimi being older and representative of Dreaming Ancestral beings. There are even depictions of Thylacines (Tasmanian Tigers), known to have been extinct in the area for at least 3,500 years. Superimpositioning of many animals such as kangaroos layered over one another, assist in the establishment of a temporal sequence at the site, however there appears to still be much research and work needed at the site for this to occur. The rock art faces many threats to its survival, including tourists and destruction from natural processes such as ant trail that go across the older panels at Burrungui, water damage and wasp nesting. Interpretive signage is present at the art sites to assist visitors in understanding these rock art treasures and the importance of their preservation. =Anbangbang= The Anbangbang Shelter drawings are some of the most famous in the National Park. One of the intricate paintings in Anbangbang shelter was created by Najombolmi, an artist of the Bardmardi clan, who painted the images with his friends in the 1963 -64 wet season. Najombolmi lived between 1895 and 1967 and is thought to have created around 604 paintings at 46 sites in Arnhem Land. Najomboli was also known as ‘Barramundi Charlie’ by some. X-ray paintings are naturalistic depictions of animals that show the internal organs and other anatomical features, which were mostly painted by Aboriginal people in red and white ochre. One such painting created by Najombolmi depicts anthropomorphic figures of Ancestral beings such as Namarrgon (lightning man), painted in the x-ray style using European blue, that Chaloupka said came from the blue pigment put in washing by Europeans as a toner to keep clothes white. Paintings and rock art such as this among the only rock art that provides absolute dating of when it was produced, as rock art is notoriously difficult to date. Anbangbang was excavated by archaeologists in 1981 and was found to have first been occupied more than 6000 years ago, with some occasional use being up to 20,000 years ago and with intensification of site use occurring between 800 and 1200 years ago when the nearby lagoon was fully formed. =Nangawulurr= Najombolmi also painted at Nangawulurr Shelter (formerly spelled Nangaloar). It is located on the northern side of Burrungui (Nourlangie Rock). Nangawulurr shelter features many styles of Aboriginal rock art that appear in other sites around the region in one area. It includes hand prints, Mimi figures in ceremonial dress, Ancestral beings, x-ray animals and dolphin-like creatures depicted in red ochre. It also features a white depiction of a two-masted sailing ship with an anchor and dingy, which may relate to the early European buffalo shooters in the area).

Sometimes hereditary and sometimes not, the title has been rendered in English as Duke (or Margrave) of Septimania (dux Septimaniæ) or Duke (or Margrave) of Gothia (Gothiæ marchio). A similar or the same \\"office\\" was often held with the title comes marcæ Hispanicæ: \\"Count (or Margrave) of the Spanish March.\\" The title was also a chronicler's device and, as presented in some chronicles, may never have been used in any official capacity. The first employer of the title \\"Duke of Septimania\\" was William of Gellone, who acted as Charlemagne's chief official and missus in the region. He was succeeded by Berengar the Wise, who also used the ducal-margravial title. He in turn was succeeded by Bernard of Septimania, who is called comes marcæ Hispanicæ in the Annales Bertiniani. He ruled over both the County of Toulouse and that of Barcelona on the other side of the Pyrenees. Toulouse was the capital of Septimania, also called Gothia or later Languedoc, while Barcelona was capital of Catalonia. They had independent histories after the Moorish conquest of Iberia, but were both Visigothic in population. The Marca Hispanica corresponded to the Gothic lands on the other side of the Pyrenees to the east of the Navarre. The marca was evidently considered a political unity composed of several counties. In the civil wars in the region which followed Bernard's downfall and death in 844, the title went into abeyance. Sometime around 858, Charles the Bald granted Humfrid several Catalan counties and the title Gothiæ marchio, signifying the same supremacy over the Hispanic march that Bernard had held years earlier. In 862, Humfrid was deposed and probably about that time, Bernard Plantapilosa was appointed to his place as margrave of Gothia. Sometime before 876, he too was deposed and replaced by Bernard II of Poitou. This Bernard was known as \\"Bernard of Gothia,\\" but his attempt to usurp authority in Gothia was met with stiff punishment by his sovereign and he was out of power by 877. In the early 880s, Charles the Fat employed three marchiones to act as viceroys in the major parts of his realm that he did not regularly visit. Bernard Plantapilos returned to favour and ruled again in Gothia and probably also Provence and Catalonia, perhaps all Aquitaine. In 932, Rudolph of France revived the title and bestowed it (princeps Gothiæ) on the brothers Ermengol of Rouergue and Raymond Pons of Toulouse. The change in title from marchio to princeps was indicative of the change in political structure and the increasing independence of the great magnates from the royal power in the tenth century. The brothers succeeded in passing the titles princeps and marchio on to their descendants, but the title had little meaning after that. William III of Toulouse, marchio prefatus in pago Tholosano (\\"prefect margrave in the Toulousain country\\"), also became Margrave of Provence.

Bacteria multiply fastest between +8 °C (46 °F) and +68 °C (154 °F). By reducing the temperature of cooked food from +70 °C (158 °F) to +3 °C (37 °F) or below within 90 minutes, the food is rendered safe for storage and later consumption. This method of preserving food is commonly used in food catering and, recently, in the preparation of 'instant' foods, as it ensures the safety and the quality of the food product. The blast chiller is a cousin of the refrigerator, another appliance designed to store food between +3 °C and +5 °C, but the blast chiller is a higher grade and more expensive appliance and is usually only found in commercial kitchens. As of 2013, in the UK, blast chillers are typically priced from GBP 2,000 to GBP 8,000 excluding VAT. Use of blast chillers is prescribed for the restaurants of the European Union, e.g. in the regulations 852/2004Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs (pdf) or 853/2004.Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for the hygiene of foodstuffs (pdf) See also * Flash freezing * Snap freezing * Food storage * Food preservation * Pumpable ice technology References External links Category:Food preservation Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ","title":"Blast chilling"},{"id":"9478350","text":"WFHB 91.3 FM is a community radio FM station in Bloomington, Indiana, United States.
