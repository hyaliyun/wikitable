She was notably the youngest woman candidate in the 1929 General Election. Early life and education She was born in Cardiff, a twin daughter of Mr and Mrs Oswald Morgan of Barry, Glamorgan. She was educated at the University of Wales where she received a Bachelor of Arts in 1925. In 1928, she was granted the degree of Doctor of Letters of the University of Paris-Sorbonne and awarded the gold medal of the Alliance française of Paris in the examination for the Diplôme Supérieur.The Times House of Commons, 1929 Writing and translating career Alfred Dreyfus She wrote Histoire du Journal des Sçavans depuis 1665 jusqu'en 1701, published in 1928. She used her French language skills as a translator of books such as Souvenirs Et Correspondance, a collection of letters during the Dreyfus affair by Alfred Dreyfus, published in 1937. The letters were contributed by Dreyfus' son Pierre after Alfred's death. In 1952, Morgan had English People Speak like This: Idiomatic English published. Political career Both her parents were active members of the Liberal party in South Wales, so she and her sister had an early experience of political activity. In April 1929 she was selected as the second Liberal candidate for the Sunderland Division at the 1929 General Election. At the age of 24, this made her the youngest woman candidate in the election.The Illustrated London News, 4 May 1929. This election was the first election in which women under the age of 30 were allowed to vote. She was not successful, but the fact that she was a 24-year-old woman did not appear to count against her as she managed to out-poll her older male running mate, who had the additional credibility of having been a former Member of Parliament. Two years later, she received an unexpected second chance at contesting Sunderland when one of the sitting Labour MPs died, causing the 1931 Sunderland by-election. Given the close nature of the contest last time between Conservative and Labour, the Liberals expected to see their vote squeezed, which is what happened; However, Morgan's performance as a by- election candidate did impress Liberals in stronger constituencies who were looking for a new candidate. Shortly after she was selected as Liberal candidate for the Shrewsbury Division for the 1931 General Election. This was a seat the Liberals last won in 1923, and they had finished a strong second at the last general election. However, the creation of a National Government meant that her main opponent, the incumbent Conservative, could not easily be attacked by a Liberal whose party was a partner in that National Government. Despite this difficulty, she highlighted her support for free trade as being the most important issue that distinguished her from her tariff-supporting Conservative opponent. She even went to the extent of advising Liberals in her home constituency of Llandaff & Barry, who were without a Liberal candidate, to vote Labour because of free trade.OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT. \\"Unionist Attack In Wales.\\" Times [London, England] 16 October 1931: 8. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 16 Feb. 2014. She did still poll a respectable second place vote; Morgan did not stand for parliament again but remained active in the Liberal party, being a guest speaker at the 1938 conference of the Home Counties Liberal Federation.The Liberal Magazine, 1938 In the late 1930s she was particularly concerned with the effects of the Spanish Civil War. She became Organising Secretary of the Basque Children's Committee working alongside the MPs Katharine Stewart-Murray, Duchess of Atholl, and Eleanor Rathbone. She was also actively involved with the Czech Refugee Trust. Later life She married Eugene Popescu in Jun 1952 at Hampstead, Middlesex. and emigrated to Connecticut, USA where she worked as a translator for the United Nations.

Background In December 1963, Fred Walker and Kevin Speight were murdered in their house on Baset Road, Remuera, Auckland. The weapon used was a .45 cal sub machine gun. In 1964, Ronald Jorgensen and John Gillies were both subsequently convicted of their murders. The Sunday News newspaper, owned by News Media (Auckland) Limited, subsequently ran an article linking Jorgensen to the murders. Jorgensen claimed he was not involved with the murders, and sued the newspaper for $2,000 for defamation. During the initial defamation trial, the newspaper tried to enter the defendants certificate of conviction for murder as evidence of justification. He was later convicted for the murders. However, following Hollington v Hewthorn & Co Ltd [1943] 2 All ER 35, the fact of a criminal conviction, could not be later used as evidence in a civil trial on the basis it was an opinion only. Jorgensen subsequently challenged the certificate of conviction being introduced as evidence in the civil trial.

The effect of the case, decided by a majority, was to reverse the outcome of Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale v Islington LBC. However, the Supreme Court departed from this ruling in Prudential Assurance Co Ltd v Revenue and Customs Commissioners. Facts Sempra Metals paid advance corporation tax on its dividends, but the tax breached EU law. Sempra Metals claimed the tax back, as it was paid under a mistake of law, and it demanded compound interest, the time value of the money. The IRC argued the award should be based on simple interest, but if compound, the rate should be the rate the Government could have borrowed at in the relevant period. Judgment The House of Lords held that there was an action for money paid under mistakes of law, Kleinwort v Lincoln CC. There was also jurisdiction for giving compound interest. The restitutionary remedy was not like damages, so the gain would need to be measured, not the loss to the claimant. The Revenue should therefore give back its whole benefit. Simple interest would fall short of true value, so compound interest was proper. Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Walker held it was extremely difficult to quantify any benefit to the revenue because it did not use the money, so resort to the convention rate of interest should be had. Lord Scott and Lord Mance dissented, saying the claim had to reflect the actual benefit received.

His subject matter ranged from still lifes, genre scenes, portraits, nudes, landscapes and interiors. He became particularly skilled in working in pastel, a medium he used almost exclusively after 1900.Firmin Baes biography at Stephen Ongpin Fine Arts Life Baes was the son of Henri Baes and Héloïse Boly. His father was a decorative painter, architect, director of the École des arts décoratifs de Bruxelles and member of the Commission des Monuments historiques (Commission for historical documents).Jany Zeebroek-Ollemans, BAES, Henri in the 'Dictionnaire des peintres belges' Still life with mushrooms and a pitcher Baes was brought up in a family of artists. In addition to his father, his uncle Jean-Baptiste Baes was an architect. Firmin was trained as a decorator along his father while decorating patrician houses and making decorative panels for hotels in Brussels. His career as a decorator developed parallel to his vocation as a painter. While working with his father he meets around 1880, the painter Léon Frédéric who became his master. From 1888 to 1894, Baes was enrolled at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, where he studied at same time as Emile Fabry and Victor Rousseau, who became his friends. With these artists he got involved in the so-called 'Académie de la Patte de Dindon' (Academy of the Turkey Paw) from 1894. This was a free academy at which art classes were given that was named after a cafe of the same name on the Grand Place, Brussels.Fernand Khnopff, A Belgian painter: Mr Henri Cassiers, in: 'The Studio', National Magazine Company, 1902, p. 4 The spinster In 1897 he competed in the Prix Godecharle with a work called The Prodigal Son but he lost to Alfred Bastien. He became close to the group of artists around the magazine Pour l'Art which was published by Octave Maus, Edmond Picard and Emile Verhaeren. In 1898, Firmin Baes joined the group which already counted Jean Delville, Victor Rousseau, Hector Thys, Fabry and others as its members. In 1900, he exhibited at the show Pour l'Art an oil on canvas painting of Archers with which later that year he obtained the bronze medal at the World's fair of Paris. With workers of his father, Firmin Baes developed a pastel technique on canvas which contributed in large part to his fame. The new techniques allowed the application of a powder, with the tip of the thumb or the little finger, to creates a discreet or vigorous aspect to the tone as well as a velvety delicacy to his compositions. The technique brings the essential complement to this artistic evolution which became more impressionistic. In 1902 he married Marie Nélis, a friend of his two sisters, Irma and Alice. They had three daughters. A writer in his spare time, Baes authored an illustrated History of Painters, published in 1941 (Brussels, Librairie Générale-Cooreman). His artistic career took off and he achieved domestic and international recognition and financial success. He exhibited frequently in Brussels at Petite Galerie and the galerie du Studio and in Charleroi at the Nouvelles Galeries. He was an amateur actor and was a member of a revue for which he wrote pieces.Jany Zeebroek-Ollemans, BAES, Firmin in the 'Dictionnaire des peintres belges' He was made an Officer in the Order of the Crown in 1923.RD 21.7.1923 Work The cleaning lady Firmin Baes was a prolific artist who painted, made works in pastel and designed prints and posters. His subject matter ranged from still lifes, genre scenes, portraits, nudes, landscapes and interiors. He became particularly skilled in working in pastel, a medium he used almost exclusively after 1900. An able draftsman, his work is distinguished by its cold realism, the surety of its line and its high level of observation. From around 1900 he worked almost exclusively in pastel. He achieved a virtuoso technique which is reminiscent of earlier masters in this medium such as Jean-Baptiste Chardin. His pastels were typically applied on canvas, rather than on paper or board. These works are usually executed on a large scale and show a refined technique and luminous colour. His mastery of pastel allowed him to obtain all color ranges. Another technique in which Baes excelled was the oal drawing. He liked drawing on large sized sheets as demonstrated in The Spinner.Firmin Baes, The spinner at Sotheby's Baes was a lithographer who designed various exhibitions poster of the Pour l'Art artist circle.Firmin Baes, Poster for the 1913 exhibition of Pour l'art at Piasa auction of 17 October 2016 lot 2 Notes External links * Category:1874 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Belgian artists Category:Belgian printmakers Category:Belgian lithographers Category:Belgian poster artists Category:Belgian illustrators Category:Officers of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) Category:20th-century Belgian painters Category:19th-century Belgian painters ","title":"Firmin Baes"},{"id":"42153997","text":"Hazell v Hammersmith and Fulham LBC [1992] 2 AC 1 is an English administrative law case, which declared that local authorities had no power to engage in interest rate swap agreements because they were beyond the Council's borrowing powers, and that all the contracts were void. Their actions were held to contravene the Local Government Act 1972. Prior to the judgment, a large number of local authorities had entered into such swap transactions. Accordingly, the decision of the House of Lords declaring such practices to be unlawful set off a torrent of collateral litigation unwinding such swaps.In his judgment, in Re Interest Rate Swap Litigation (unreported, 28 November 1991), Hirst J recorded that \\"As at 30th October, 1991 there were 203 extant swap actions, 18 had been settled after the issue of proceedings, 2 had been discontinued and 4 are in progress in the Chancery Division. Although in the vast majority of cases the banks are plaintiffs, there are 10 actions involving 8 local authorities in which a local authority is plaintiff because they are net losers under their swap transactions. The number of plaintiff banks in these actions totals in all 42 and the number of local authority defendants 62. These figures may need up-dating, but give a substantially accurate picture.\\" Although this clearly caused difficulties for the banks and local authorities engaged in such swap transactions, it has been noted that the \\"swap litigation\\" was instrumental in developing the modern law of restitution under English law. Facts Up until the early 1990s, a number of local authorities had been engaged in interest rate swap transactions as part of managing their debt portfolios. Under the Local Authorities Act 1972, the local authorities had power to borrow in order to amortise their costs of capital projects over a longer period of time. In connection with that borrowing, certain local authorities sought to enter into swap transactions to hedge their exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. There were some doubts as to the ability of local authorities to enter into such transactions, but the local authorities sought the opinion of Anthony Scrivener QC, a leading commercial silk, who had advised that if a \\"rate swap is undertaken as part of the proper management of the council's fund then ... the swap will be intra vires\\" [i.e. within the powers of the council].McKendrick, at page 208. Whilst most local authorities engaged in swap transactions on a prudent scale to manage their debt portfolios, the position of Hammersmith and Fulham LBC was different. Writing about the swaps litigation, Professor Ewan McKendrick described it thus: In his 2008 book, Follow The Money, Duncan Campbell Smith paints a dramatic picture of the moments before the litigation commenced, with the slowly dawning realisation developing amongst the principals that somehow a very left-wing London Borough Council has managed to accumulate an extraordinarily large swaps exposure to the various banks simply to be able to collect and spend the premiums for entering into the trades: When Mr Scrivener QC was asked to give a further opinion in relation to the matter, having been made better aware of the scale of the activities of Hammersmith, he advised that if one looked at all of the transactions in their totality, one could not say \\"these transactions were part and parcel of debt management so as to be lawful\\".McKendrick, at page 209. In his judgment, Lord Templeman noted that although the total borrowings of Hammersmith were in the order of £390 million, it had entered into swap transactions with a total aggregate notional principal of £6,052 million.[1991] 2 AC 1, at 26F. When the district auditor (Tony Hazell) became aware of the scale of Hammersmith and Fulham's activities in the swap market he brought proceedings to determine whether or not those activities were lawful. Although the case is reported as Hazell against Hammersmith and Fulham, in practice the various banks were joined as third parties, and Hammersmith and Fulham joined with Hazell in arguing that the swaps were unlawful and should not be binding upon them. The banks were understandably upset that Hammersmith and Fulham were selected to be the test case, given that its activities were at the extreme end of the spectrum.Despite the banks' ire, this was fairly understandable. Because Hammersmith and Fulham had entered into so many swaps for so many different purposes, it enabled the court to make rulings which would cover the broadest range of scenarios, given it greater value as a test case. In addition to being upset at the choice of Hammersmith (rather than a Council which had made more responsible use of interest rate swaps), the various banks were also reported to have been upset by the decision for the case to be brought in the Divisional Court rather than in the Commercial Division of the Chancery Court, where a judge might have been expected to have greater familiarity with transactions of this nature. Judgment =Divisional Court and Court of Appeal= Recognising the importance of the point, the case was heard by two judges at first instance in the Divisional Court, Woolf LJ and French J. They delivered a judgment on 1 November 1989, and they held that the swap transactions were ultra vires and beyond the powers of the local authorities.[1990] 2 QB 697 It was noted, with no small sense of irony, that \\"the decision had the bizarre effect of 'benefiting the chief culprit' (Hammersmith), while hurting the more prudent local authorities.\\"McKendrick, at page 211. The case was appealed and came before Sir Stephen Brown P, Nicholls LJ and Bingham LJ who handed down their decision on 22 February 1990.Also reported at [1990] 2 QB 697 The Court of Appeal broadly divided the swap entered into by the local authorities into three different types: # Purely speculative swaps, which it held were void; # Swaps which were part of managing the local authoritiies' interest rate exposure under their borrowing, which it held were valid; and # Swaps which were entered into by local authorities once it became apparent that earlier swaps might be void to mitigate the damage caused by those void swaps (called the \\"interim strategy\\"), which it held were also valid.The Court of Appeal felt that if a local authority reasonably believed that it was subject to a liability (under the void swaps), then it had the necessary powers to take reasonable steps to mitigate that liability. Even if that meant doing more of what it should not have done in the first place. Both at first instance and in the Court of Appeal, the judgments were deliberately handed down at a time when the markets were closed. The case was then appealed to the House of Lords. =House of Lords= The main judgment was given by Lord Templeman, with whom all judges agreed. Lord Ackner gave a short concurring judgment. After recounting the facts and describing in brief terms what an interest rate swap contract is, Lord Templeman then expanded upon the facts, noting that the various swaps fell into three categories. # The first category was where swaps were entered simply to speculate. In relation to those swaps the banks conceded that they were unlawful.[1991] 2 AC 1, at 27D. # The second category was where swaps were entered into with respect to an existing loan to try and capitalise upon a change in interests. Accordingly, whilst they were also speculative in nature, they did directly relate to an existing loan exposure of the local authority. In the judgment these were referred to as \\"parallel contracts\\" or \\"replacing\\" interest rates. Lord Templeman noted quickly that \\"a parallel contract does not in fact replace the interest under the original borrowing and the swap transaction is a speculation no different in quality although different in magnitude from a swap contract which is not entered into by reference to any existing borrowing.\\"[1991] 2 AC 1, at 27G. # The third category related to swaps also entered into in connection with an existing loan, where the local authority sought to use swaps to alter the proportion of the interest which was paid on either a fixed or variable basis through swap contracts. In the judgment these were referred to as \\"re-profiling\\". Similarly, Lord Templeman determined fairly immediately in his judgment that these were in his view largely indistinguishable from parallel contracts.[1991] 2 AC 1, at 28A. \\"Basically therefore \\"re-profiling\\" is only an extension of \\"replacing.\\"\\" Powers of local authorities Having almost immediately stated that all swaps were, in his view, conceptually the same as the types of swap which the banks had admitted were unlawful, Lord Templeman then explored the limits of the powers of local authorities under the Local Government Act 1972. He sought to explore whether the \\"replace\\" and \\"re-profile\\" swaps could be said to be \\"calculated to facilitate\\" or were \\"conducive to\\" the power of the local authorities to borrow under section 111 of the statute. He referred to the judgments of Lord Blackburn and Lord Selborne LC in Attorney-General v Great Eastern Railway Co (1880) 5 App Cas 473 where the House of Lords had held unequivocally that where powers are conferred upon a statutory corporation \\"what it does not expressly or impliedly authorise is to be taken to be prohibited\\". He referred further to the decision of Lord Selborne LC in Small v Smith (1884) 10 App Cas 119 where the House of Lords held that granting powers to deal generally in a certain type of business did not mean that there is a potential necessity for entering into all manner of related transactions. Lord Templeman thought that reasoning directly analogous to the case in hand. Finally, Lord Templeman referred to the decision of Lord Loreburn LC in Attorney-General v Mersey Railway Co [1907 AC 415 where he said \\"The rule of law has been laid down in this House to the effect that it must be shown that the business can fairly be regarded as incidental to or consequential upon the use of the statutory powers.\\" Lord Templeman held that \\"The same considerations apply in the present case.\\"[1991] 2 AC 1, at 31D. Having considered the weight of authority, Lord Templeman noted that, despite its title, debt management is not in itself a function. He also noted that in the case of building societies Parliament has expressly conferred upon them a power to enter into swap transactions.The Building Societies (Prescribed Contracts) Order 1986 (SI No 2098 of 1986). He finally concluded: The \\"arcane point\\" Lord Templeman finally addressed what he referred to as the bank's \\"arcane\\" point.[1991] 2 AC 1, at 39C. Broadly, that stated that the incorporated Hammersmith and Fulham Borough could only act through the unincorporated Hammersmith and Fulham Borough Council, and though the powers of the council are limited by the Local Government Act 1972, the borough itself has all the powers of a natural person. It was conceded that this would not save transactions entered into out of the general rate fund (which would presumably be most of them), but might save transactions funded from other sources. Lord Templeman stated \\"This argument strikes me as being not so much arcane as absurd.\\"[1991] 2 AC 1, at 39F. The argument drew on Sutton's Hospital Case (1612) 10 Co Rep 1 that the use of a common seal allowed a corporate to do anything that a natural person might do. This only applies to a corporation created by exercise of the Royal prerogative (Riche v Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Co (1874) LR 9 Ex 224 at 263). But in the present case, Hammersmith was a hybrid corporation. Reaction The reaction of banks and financial institutions to the judgment has been described as \\"furious\\".Wolmar, \\"Money Market Deals Ruled Unlawful\\", The Independent (25 January 1991) Having entered into transactions with local authorities in good faith, the banks now found themselves embroiled in costly litigation to unwind hundreds of financial contracts at great expense. Various suggestions were made that the decision might imperil London's reputation as a financial centre. The reaction of the local authorities is reported to have been mixed; whilst many councils were relieved of potentially large liabilities, their officials had nonetheless effectively been found to have engaged in unlawful conduct. Furthermore, the local authorities also had to face the unpleasant prospect of the litigation to unwind the swaps. Although Hammersmith and its ratepayers were saved from a potentially massive and crippling financial exposure, the picture that the case painted was not at all a pretty one. And, as has been pointed out, for all the criticisms that are made of the chaos that the decision caused, ultimately, the doctrine of ultra vires functioned as it was supposed to - protecting persons (the ratepayers) from the effects of persons wielding executive power in doing things that they were not supposed to do.McKendrick, at page 216. The banks made some attempts to have retrospective legislation passed to legalise the swaps, but were not successful in doing so. Aftermath The decision led to a torrent of litigation unwinding swap transactions entered into with local authorities. In his judgment Lord Templeman referred to their being \\"about 400\\" open swaps between banks and local authorities. Many councils had multiple open positions.Hammersmith and Fulham LBC had entered into a total of 592 swaps, of which 297 were still open. However, as noted above, Hammersmith was an outlier and most other councils had far fewer positions in the swap market. In a subsequent case management hearing, Hirst J indicated that over 200 separate sets legal proceedings were ongoing. These are often collectively referred to as the \\"swaps cases\\".

The species was first described by Frederick Smith in 1858. Colonies of this ant are abundant in eastern Australia. Ants of this species are known for their ability to jump up to 10 centimetres, and they also have a powerful, venomous sting. Rather than foraging on the ground, M. nigrocincta prefer to forage in trees where they are known to pollinate certain flowers. This ant is a large species, some workers can grow to over in length. They have a distinctive pattern of orange-red and black which distinguishes them from other Myrmecia species. M. nigrocincta possess the gamergates gene which allows workers to reproduce, either in the presence of a queen or in a colony where the queen is missing. Life expectancy of a worker ant is over one year. They are known to enslave ants of other species as workers for their colony, and they are aggressive when attacking intruders. Distribution Abundant in eastern Australia, M. nigrocincta ants prefer temperate bushlands, and are usually located in dry to semi-dry forests and sclerophyll woodlands. The species is found in the eastern states of Australia, mostly on the coastal plains where much suitable dry forest habitat can be found. They prefer tropical climates and warm temperatures. They can also be found in other types of habitat at elevations ranging from 80 - 1,220 metres (262 ft - 4,000 ft). M. nigrocincta colonies have been recorded from Cairns, Atherton, Mackay, Mt. Tamborine, Brisbane, Blackall Range and Fletcher in Queensland. In New South Wales, this ant occurs in Lismore, Dorrigo, Armidale and Sydney (notably in the suburbs of Heathcote and Como), while in Victoria it is found in Trafalgar and Millgrove. Several colonies have also been recorded in South Australia. Taxonomy M. nigrocincta was first identified by British entomologist Frederick Smith in 1858, after syntype workers were collected and described in his work Catalogue of hymenopterous insects in the collection of the British Museum part VI. In a study on phylogenetic relationships among species group of the genus Myrmecia, four species with an occipital carina including M. nigrocincta were found to form a paraphyletic and basal assemblage, while other Myrmecia species lacking an occiptal carina were shown to have a supported monophyletic assemblage.Hasegawa, Eisuke, and Crozier, Ross H. (2006) Phylogenetic relationships among species groups of the ant genus Myrmecia. Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution, 38 (3). pp. 575-582. The type specimen is located in the British Museum. Description M. nigrocincta worker Ants of genus Myrmecia are generally referred to as \\"bulldog ants\\" and M. nigrocincta, like other species in the genus, has elongated mandibles. M. nigrocincta ants are primarily black and orange-red in colour. They have mandibles which are either black or yellow depending on where the ants are found. The gaster, head, legs and mesonotum are black while the pronotum, propodeum, petiole and post- petiole are red. The ant has linear ridges along the front of its head. It also has apical spurs on the tibia of both its middle leg and hind leg. The legs are thin and become more slender away from the body. M. nigrocincta can be distinguished from other species in the genus Myrmecia by the bi-coloured thorax and post-petiole which are yellowish-red and black and the yellowish- red node. The workers are long, the males while the female (queen) is . The development of the queen's wings is rudimentary and the stubby, reduced wings render the queen flightless. Behaviour and ecology The large eyes on M. nigrocincta provide excellent vision when it forages M. nigrocincta is an accomplished jumper with leaps ranging from . It has good vision and can be observed running amongst plants and leaves, occasionally jumping from one branch to another. It is mostly found foraging on plants, trees, and other vegetation, but it sometimes forages on the ground. It propels its jumps by a sudden extension of its middle and hind legs. M. nigrocincta ants are diurnal and do not hibernate. They are omnivores, and feed on other insects including caterpillars and spiders, as well as honey water. M. nigrocincta has been observed to prey on the larvae of imperial hairstreak butterflies, even jumping while carrying them. Predators of M. nigrocincta (and the genus Myrmecia as a whole) include spiders, birds, lizards, mammals and other predatory invertebrates, including assassin bugs and redbacks. The ants have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis and are considered as a possible pollination vector for E. regnans trees. as recorded in Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict capacity to effect pollination. These ants live in nests in sandy soil which sometimes have a mound, which resembles a molehill. M. nigrocincta ants labor to conceal their nests using twigs and leaves. Depending on the type of habitat in which the colony is located, they decorate the nest with plant material and gravel. Other materials that are used to camouflage M. nigrocincta colonies include dry leaves, rocks, vegetation, and twigs. Nests are beside a clump of grass or bush or at the base of a tree. The colonies of M. nigrocincta ants are monogyne, i.e. they have only one queen per colony. The queen is semi- claustral, meaning that during the founding of the new colony, the queen has to forage so that she has enough food to raise her brood. Colonies have between 400 and 1200 individuals and are thus considered to be \\"large\\" colonies. M. nigrocinta is known to enslave Leptomyrmex and other species of ants. The worker and scout M. nigrocincta ants use pheromones for communication. They are quick to defend their nests and may react aggressively even to a shadow crossing their nest. Wheeler (1922) describes the reaction of M. nigrocincta to the disturbance of their nest as \\"they bound out of their small mound nest in a series of short hops like Lilliputian cavalry galloping to battle.\\" The ants aggressively defend their colony, causing multiple bites and wilingly sacrificing themselves to protect the queen and the colony. Life cycle M. nigrocincta is a gamergate species, which allows female workers to be fertile, and these are then able to reproduce in both queenless and queenright (colonies with a queen) colonies. This means a colony which loses its queen can still thrive in the absence of the queen. In laboratory colonies of M. nigrocincta where there was no queen present, worker-laid eggs were reared to mature males, showing that workers are highly fertile. The average life expectancy of an adult worker M. nigrocincta ant is 1.1 to 1.2 years, with a maximum expectancy of 1.3 years (400 or more days). Larvae collected from M. nigrocincta are 4.7mm in length but increase to 9.7mm when matured. Venom M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings which are painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many days and the sting itches. If left untreated, the sting may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula, is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and contains active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, as well as phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking part of the study reacted to the sting of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).

They are not as long as saltwater crocodiles. Their average size is about 13–14 feet. Until the British colonised India, crocodiles were never critically endangered. Afterwards, an Indian biologist (of American origin) named Romulus Whitaker established the Madras Crocodile Bank for conservation and breeding of crocodiles. Now, there are thousands of crocodiles in the Madras bank alone. Although, in rest of India, one can still see crocodiles in wild - in rivers and national parks. Even today, there is a huge lack of information about these species because of taboos and folklore associated with crocodiles. =Saltwater crocodile= Saltwater crocodile The saltwater crocodile is found in the eastern states of Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

It was composed in 1950 and is one of Ligeti's collections of Hungarian pieces which the composer himself conceived as a whole.  Composition  This composition was written in 1950, when Ligeti was still living in Hungary. As Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, Ligeti was very interested in adapting and arranging Hungarian traditional music with his own style. During this period, Hungary was going through a repressive Stalinist era. Ligeti himself commented once on one of its performances: Ligeti also composed other early vocal compositions based on Hungarian folksongs, such as Bujdosó and Mátraszentimrei dalok. This composition was never given a formal premiere, even though it was published by Schott Music in 1952.  Analysis  The compositions is in two movements, which are the two different dances featured in it. It takes approximately three minutes to perform. Both of its movements are joined with an attacca. The movement list is as follows: * 1. Fellülről fúj az őszi szél. Andante * 2. Eb fél, kutya fél. Allegro molto It is scored for a mixed choir consisting of sopranos, altos, tenors, and basses. The songs arranged in this composition are traditional songs from the Hungarian area of Kálló.

It was the beginning of the sale of lots in urban region, which would constitute the locality and would only serve to \\"supply center\\" of the Railroad Rede Viação Parana/Santa Catarina. However, documents and statements related to possession of land reveal the presence of families in the rural area since the 1930s, coming to increase considerably in the next decade. The first families misfits careen their way toward the ground, opened clearings and formed the first coffee plantations. Many of these pioneers, years later, were the first residents also in urban area, contributing to the development of the locality. The first inhabitants were, in their majority, immigrants coming from the state of São Paulo and the Brazilian Northeastern region, dreaming with the riches of Northern Paraná. They have acquired their lands, by opening the mata and forming large rural lots. Thus began the planting of coffee. In the urban area, in 1974, the loteadoras began the sale of land. But the real estate boom occurred in 1976. On occasion, a large number of families left the field by virtue of frost which decimated the coffee plantations. The success in selling urban land made possible the opening of new subdivisions. The strong economic growth, the expansion of the urban area and the increase in the collection of taxes are driving the emergence of a popular movement calling for the political emancipation of the locality, which at that time belonged to Marialva. A popular plebiscite in 1981 approved the creation of the municipality of Sarandi, according to the Law in 7052/1982.http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/estatistica/populacao/censo2013/populacao_por_municipio.shtm Metropolitan Region Today, Sarandi search solve several problems that come from your appearance, such as the lack of planning and urban development, education, culture, health, education, and violence, which, to the few, result in improvements in the quality of life of its population.

Schneps has written general audience math books and, under the pen name Catherine Shaw, has written mathematically themed murder mysteries. Education Schneps earned a B.A. in Mathematics, German Language and Literature from Radcliffe College in 1983. She completed a Doctorat de Troisième Cycle in Mathematics at Université Paris-Sud XI-Orsay in 1985 under the supervision of John H. Coates with a thesis on p-adic L-functions attached to elliptic curves, a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1990 with a thesis on p-Adic L-functions and Galois groups, and Habilitation at Université de Franche-Comté in 1993, with a thesis on the Inverse Galois problem. Professional experience Schneps held various teaching assistant positions in France and Germany until the completion of her Ph.D. in 1990, then worked as a postdoctoral assistant at the ETH in Zurich, Switzerland for one year. In 1991 she was awarded a tenured research position at CNRS, the French National Centre for Scientific Research, at the University of Franche-Comté in Besançon. During the late 1990s Schneps also had short- term visiting researcher assignments at Harvard University, Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study, and MSRI at Berkeley. Publications =Academic= Schneps has published academic papers on various aspects of analytic number theory since the late 1980s. Her early work explored p-adic L-functions, which became the topic of her first thesis, and around 2010 she was continuing to work on the related fields of zeta functions. Since the late 1990s she focused on aspects of Galois theory, including Galois groups, geometric Galois actions, and the inverse Galois problem, and has been described by Jordan Ellenberg as \\"the arithmetic geometer . . . who taught me most of what I know about Galois actions on fundamental groups of varieties\\". Her work led to her study of the related Grothendieck–Teichmüller group, and she has become a member of a group preserving the works and history of Grothendieck. In the early 2010s she published research investigating various aspects of Lie algebras. =Books= Schneps has also edited and contributed to several mathematics textbooks in number theory. She edited a series of lecture notes on Grothendieck's theory of dessins d'enfants and contributed an article to the series, was an editor for a text on the Inverse Galois Problem, and edited a book on Galois groups. She was a co-author of a text on Field Theory and co-editor of another on Galois–Teichmüller Theory. In 2013, Schneps and her daughter, mathematician Coralie Colmez, published the book Math on Trial: How Numbers Get Used and Abused in the Courtroom. Targeted at a general audience, the book uses ten historical legal cases to show how mathematics, especially statistics, can affect the outcome of criminal proceedings, especially when incorrectly applied or interpreted. The mathematical concepts covered include statistical independence (discussed using the examples of the Sally Clark case and the murder of Meredith Kercher), Simpson's paradox (UC Berkeley gender bias case) and statistical modeling using a binomial distribution (Howland will forgery trial). While not written as a textbook, some reviewers found it suitable for students, as an introduction to the topic and to \\"get them thinking, talking and even arguing about the issues involved\\", with another agreeing that, \\"they have struck the right balance of providing enough mathematics for the specialist to check out the details, but not so much as to overwhelm the general reader\\", and another finding the book suitable \\"for parents trying to support teenagers in their studies of mathematics – or in fact, law\\". While most reviews were positive, there was some criticism concerning its over-simplification of mathematics' influence in complex trial proceedings. One reviewer finds that, while the book's description of the weakness of some mathematics presented in courtrooms is valid, the text magnifies mathematics' role in legal proceedings, which traditionally feature evidentiary analysis at appellate as well as trial stages and have preexisting standards for treating certain types of evidence. Another suggests the book was influenced by the authors' selection of cases to show a \\"disastrous record of causing judicial error\\", thus attributing insufficient weight to the counterbalancing traditionally inherent in legal proceedings—as lawyers attack opposing evidence and experts with their own, and appellate judges write to influence the conduct of trial judges faced with various types of ordinary and expert testimony. =Translations= Schneps has produced English-language translations of several French-language books and papers, including Invitation to the mathematics of Fermat-Wiles, Galois theory, A Mathematician Grappling With His Century, Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry II, p-adic L-Functions and p-Adic Representations, and Renormalization methods : critical phenomena, chaos, fractal structures. Grothendieck Circle Mathematician Alexander Grothendieck became a recluse in 1991 and removed his published works from circulation. More than a decade later, Schneps and Pierre Lochak located him in a town in the Pyrenees, then carried on a correspondence. Thus they became among \\"the last members of the mathematical establishment to come into contact with him\\". Schneps became a founding member of the Grothendieck Circle, a group dedicated to making information by and about Grothendieck available, and created and maintains the Grothendieck Circle website, a repository of information regarding Grothendieck, including his own unpublished writings. She also assisted with the translation of his correspondence with Jean-Pierre Serre. Fiction writing In 2004, Schneps published (as Catherine Shaw) The Three Body Problem, a Cambridge Mystery, a murder mystery novel involving mathematicians in Cambridge in the late 1800s, working on the three-body problem. The title is a double entendre, referring to both the mathematical problem and the three murder victims. While a mathematician reviewing the book disliked the Victorian writing style, he found the math accurate, and the mathematicians' personalities and sociology \\"well portrayed\\". When another reviewer contacted the author, she confirmed that Catherine Shaw was a pseudonym and that she was actually an academic and practicing mathematician but preferred to remain anonymous. It has since been revealed that Catherine Shaw is the pseudonym of Leila Schneps. Schneps, as Catherine Shaw, has published four historical novels in the series, all featuring the same main character Vanessa Duncan, and all following mathematical themes: *Flowers Stained with Moonlight was called a mystery that was \\"very easy to solve\\", as the book's title is from a poem by Lord Alfred Douglas, which strongly hits at the solution to the crime. *The Library Paradox also has a double entendre title, as the story is a classic locked room mystery set in a library, but also alludes to Russell's paradox, which arises from the question of whether a library catalog should include itself in its contents. The murder victim in the story was antisemitic, and the story mentions the Dreyfus affair and explores the issues of \\"being Jewish in 1896 London\\". *The Riddle of the River explores \\"the theatre world, the late 19th century craze for séances, [and] the Marconi revolution which will lead to the invention of the telegraph\\". *Fatal Inheritance explores \\"the importance of heredity and how it might influence the nation's health; Dr Freud's latest theories; and . . . the dubious 'science' of eugenics\\". As Shaw, Schneps has also published a non-fiction guide to solving Sudoku and Kakuro puzzles. thumb Activism Schneps promotes public awareness of the importance of the proper use of mathematics and statistics in criminal proceedings. Schneps is a member of the Bayes and the Law International Consortium. Personal life Coralie Colmez is the daughter of Schneps and Pierre Colmez.

The procedure also involves a splenectomy. The operation was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices (commonly a complication of liver cirrhosis) that were untreatable by other conventional methods. It was originally developed as a two-step operation, but has been modified numerous times by many surgeons since its original creation.  Introduction  The Sugiura procedure was originally developed to treat bleeding esophageal varices and consisted mainly of an esophagogastric devascularization. It was developed in Japan in 1973Sugiura M, and Futagawa S. A new technique for treating esophageal varices. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery. 1973;66(5):677. as a nonshunting technique that achieved variceal bleeding hemostasis by interrupting the variceal blood flow along the gastroesophageal junction. The procedure consists primarily of paraesophagogastric devascularization achieved by dividing the perforating veins of the esophagus and the stomach while maintaining the plexus of collaterals that connect the coronary gastric vein to the azygous system. The original procedure also consisted of an esophageal transection, splenectomy, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty. The Sugiura procedure was originally associated with significant morbidity and mortality; in recent years, though, this procedure and its modifications have been performed in many hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgical centers with improving morbidity and mortality rates.Ginsberg RJ, Waters PF, Zeldin RA, Spratt EH, Shandling B, Stone RM, and Strasberg S.

World J Surg. 1984, Oct;8(5):673-9. = Emergent procedure = Emergency Sugiura procedure is indicated when Child-Pugh class A or B cirrhotic patients are acutely bleeding from gastroesophageal varices that are not responsive to medical or radiological therapies.  Pediatrics  A study of 15 children, aged 2–12 years old who all had multiple episodes of severe esophageal bleeding varices, and a mean follow-up time of 10 years 4 months, demonstrated 0% mortality and 80% resolution with disappearance of the varices and no evidence of recurrent bleeding. No cases of esophageal stenosis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hiatal hernia, encephalopathy or hepatic dysfunction were documented. The Sugiura procedure is a safe and effective surgical treatment of esophageal varices in the pediatric population.  Procedure  = Original technique = The original technique described by Sugiura and Futagawa was a two-step operation consisting of an initial thoracic operation followed by the abdominal operation 3–4 weeks later. The thoracic operation consists of an extensive paraesophageal devascularization up to the inferior pulmonary vein and esophageal transection. The abdominal operation consists of a splenectomy, devascularization of the abdominal esophagus and cardia, and a selective vagotomy with pyloroplasty. = Thoracic operation = Access is gained through a left lateral thoracotomy incision below the sixth rib. The inferior mediastinum is exposed to the level of the anterior aspect of the descending aorta. All of the shunting veins that direct blood to the collateral veins from the esophagus are ligated, taking special consideration to preserving the extraesophageal systemic venous collaterals (azygous veins). Usually between 30-50 shunting veins are present. Once devascularization is complete, the esophagus is clamped in two areas with esophageal clamps, and esophageal transection is done at the level of the diaphragm. The anterior muscular and mucosal layers are divided, but the posterior layer is left intact. Sutures are then placed and the divided varices are occluded. The muscle layer is then reattached. A nasogastric tube is left in situ, and the mediastinum is closed. = Abdominal operation = Access is gained through an upper midline incision with left lateral extension. Splenectomy is then performed. The abdominal esophagus is devascularized from the stomach. The posterior gastric vagus nerve requires ligation due to its close proximity. The lesser curvature of the stomach and abdominal esophagus are then devascularized, and the cardioesophageal branches of the left gastric vessels are ligated and divided. The esophagus and cardia are then entirely mobilized. The anterior gastric vagus nerve was previously divided and therefore pyloroplasty is performed. A drain is inserted in the surgical cavity and the incision is closed. = Modified Sugiura procedure = Since the majority of documented Sugiura procedures performed outside Japan failed to achieve the exceptionally low mortality and morbidity rates, various authors have proposed modifications to make the procedure less complex.Pierce GE, Thomas JH, and Estes NC. A transthoracic devascularization procedure for control of bleeding esophageal varices: preliminary report. Am J Surg. 1977, Dec;134(6):794-8.

Mathur SK, Shah SR, Soonawala ZF, Karandikar SS, Nagral SS, Dalvi AN, and Mirza DF. Transabdominal extensive oesophagogastric devascularization with gastro-oesophageal stapling in the management of acute variceal bleeding. Br J Surg. 1997, Mar;84(3):413-7. Weese JL, Starling JR, and Yale CE. Control of bleeding esophageal varices by transabdominal esophageal transection, gastric devascularization, and splenectomy. Surg Gastroenterol. 1984;3(1):31-6. One common modification uses a single abdominal operation to achieve gastroesophageal devascularization. A splenectomy is initially performed and is followed by devascularization of the distal esophagus through the diaphragm hiatus and the superior two-thirds of the major and lesser gastric curve taking careful consideration to not ligate the left gastric vein. To ensure complete separation of the azygous vein system from the intramucosal venous plexus, an end-to-end anastomosing stapling device transects and anastomosis a region of the esophagus 4–6 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. This anastomosis can then be reinforced with vicryl suture. A pyloroplasty is routinely followed to facilitate gastric emptying.  Morbidity and mortality  Early experience with the Sugiura procedure demonstrated, following the procedures, the overall operative mortality was 32% and overall morbidity occurred in 33% of the patients.Barbot DJ, and Rosato EF. Experience with the esophagogastric devascularization procedure. Surgery. 1987;101(6):685-690. Significant causes of morbidity and mortality were related to complications of the esophageal transection as anastomotic leakage occurred in 8.6% of patients undergoing emergent surgery versus 4.8% in elective cases. All patients who developed an esophageal leak died.Gouge TH, and Ranson JH. Esophageal transection and paraesophagogastric devascularization for bleeding esophageal varices. The American Journal of Surgery. 1986;151(1):47-54. For this reason, modification of the original procedure was introduced to avoid the risk of perioperative mortality due to esophageal transection. Retrospective analyses of patients who received the Sugiura procedure between 1967 and 1984 for either elective, emergency, or prophylactic setting demonstrate that operative mortality was greatest in the emergency setting (13.3%), followed by prophylactic (3.9%) and elective surgery (3.0%).  Outcomes  Recent reports of selected patients undergoing Sugiura procedure reported that recurrence of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding occurs in only 2.3% of patients.

Its systems automate traditional nucleic acid tests (tests for specific sequences of DNA or RNA). The tests can be used to identify and analyze pathogens and genetic disorders. Cepheid sells clinical tests for healthcare-associated infections, infectious diseases, sexual health, oncology and genetics. The cartridges used in Cepheid's testing machines are single-use and must be bought from the manufacturer. The company has been accused of profiteering, with a Doctors without Borders analysis claiming that Cephid is charging over six times the cost of production for COVID-19 test cartridges sold to developing countries.  Founding and corporate status  The company went public in 2000. Cepheid was founded in March 1996 by Thomas Gutshall, Bill McMillan, Dr. Kurt Petersen, Dr. Greg Kovacs, Steven Young and Dr. Allen Northrup. The initial public offering was June 21, 2000 at US$6 per share. Cepheid stock was listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol CPHD until it was acquired by Danaher in 2016. The company's first CEO was Tom Gutshall, who held the position from 1996 to 2002. In April 2002, John L. Bishop was appointed CEO. In August 2016, the company had a market capitalization of US$2.66 billion. In late 2016, Danaher Corp. bought Cepheid for US$4 billion, citing a large base of already- installed test instruments, and a wide menu of tests that fit in them. Cepheid is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. System FISH testing, a standard techniqure for identifying pathogens, is done automatically by Cepehid's GeneXpert test systems Cepehid owns the GeneXpert rapid molecular diagnostic system, its main product. The system was developed in the 1990s; the design remained substantially the same from the turn of the century to 2020. Similar tests have subsequently been developed by Abbott and Roche. The GeneXpert system identifies organisms from their DNA. It extracts genetic material from a sample and, in the case of RNA viruses, it converts the RNA into DNA first. The GeneXpert test is basically an automated version of standard real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification and detection. Each sample to be tested is added to a single-use GeneXpert cartridge, sold by Cepheid; after this, the tests are self-contained and fully-automated. The cartridge contains a series of injection-moulded plastic chambers, which hold the chemicals and the sample. To run the test, multiple cartridges are loaded into a desktop machine (also made by Cepheid, but reusable). The sample and chemicals are moved into the test chambers using microfluidics: there is a rotary valve in the center, and some small plungers; the plungers push the sample into the valve, the valve rotates to a new position, and the sample is them pulled out into a new chamber. The machine provides the temperature cycling needed for the PCR (much like a programmable oven). This makes many copies of DNA matching the sample (amplification). Finally, the presences or absence of the pathogen is detected using FISH probes. These are short sections of DNA which have been made to attach to a fluorescent molecule. If the DNA from the sample matches the DNA of the FISH probes, the two bind, and the sample fluoresces. An optical system detects the glow, or its absence. A test for a new disease can be made by simply swapping in a FISH probe that matches the sequence of the new disease. History The company was thrust into the limelight after the 2001 anthrax attacks as one of the few companies producing rapid, accurate biodetection field units based on DNA analysis. Cepheid had developed unique improvements on Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's fast-cycling technique for preparing DNA samples. US federal agencies used Cepheid machines to detect the spreading anthrax contamination and identify its possible sources. In 2003, the company put a temporary hold on some healthcare development to work with defense contractor, Northrop Grumman, on a US federal government contract to install anthrax detection systems at US Post Office sites nationwide. Cepheid won the 2006 Industrial Design Excellence Awards for its product, Reagent Bead Dispenser. The first clinical application for the GeneXpert System was introduced in 2006 with the US FDA clearance of XpertGBS, a rapid molecular diagnostic test for Group B Streptococcus in expectant women. That same year, XpertGBS was categorized by the FDA as \\"Moderate Complexity\\" under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). It was the first amplified molecular diagnostic test using real-time PCR to receive this categorization. This allowed the test to be performed by the over 27,000 institutions registered for CLIA Moderate Complexity in addition to the approximately 7,000 institutions registered for High Complexity tests. In 2012, Cepheid won a contract with the US Department of Veterans Affairs for its MRSA reagent test kits. As of March 31, 2014, Cepheid markets 14 US FDA- cleared clinical in vitro diagnostic (IVD) tests in the US and 16 IVD tests internationally and has placed 6,012 GeneXpert systems globally. , there are over 23 000 GeneXpert machines globally, 7000 - 10,000 of them in Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia, with over a hundred in some African countries, due to long-term investment in tuberculosis-testing infrastructure by The Global Fund, among others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Cepheid announced a partnership with Sherlock Biosciences in February 2020 to begin development of a CRISPR-based diagnostic test for the SARS-CoV-2 (then called \\"2019-nCov\\") virus, to run on the same machines as Cepheid's 20-year-old GeneXpert tests, as there were machines already installed in hospitals. In March 2020, the company announced a rapid diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2; the US FDA granted an emergency use authorization for the test. The diagnostic is designed to run on any of the (over 23,000) existing Cepheid GeneXpert machines worldwide, with the standard 45 minute detection time. Pricing controversy There has been controversy around Cepheid's test-cartridge pricing. Cepheid announced that they would charge US$19.80 per COVID-19 test in developing countries (prices are higher in middle-income countries; for instance, GeneXpert TB tests cost $55-$82 per cartridge in Indonesia). Doctors without borders stated that that price was not affordable in countries where people live on less than two dollars a day. They estimated that the cost to Cepheid of providing the test is as low as $3, and called the offered price profiteering, asking that Cepheid make a more moderate profit by selling the tests for US$5 each. The Treatment Action Group (TAG) seconded this request, saying that the development of the tests, and their purchase and global deployment, has been done with public funds, while the owners of Cepeid made profits of $3 billion in 2019. They requested the same price reduction for all the tests using the same technique, including HIV, tuberculosis, and Hepatitis C, as the costs are similar regardless of the disease (see above). They pointed out that the cartridges for testing for COVID-19 were twice the price of nearly-identical cartridges for tuberculosis, . The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease also gave public support. Some dozens of organizations worldwide had joined the “Time for $5” campaign .

It is located on the Kanchipuram - Vandavasi road, near Dusi and about 15 km from Kanchipuram. It is known for the 7th-century rock- cut cave temple, housing a Tamil Brahmi inscription, one of the monuments of national importance as declared by the Archaeological Survey of India. Brahmi is the earliest Indian alphabetical script with regional variations, dated between 300 BCE and 300 CE. Inscriptions in the rock-cut temples , attribute the temples to 7th-century CE Pallava king, Mahendravarman I, a ruler who delighted in the titles of Vichitra chitta (\\"curious-minded\\") and Chitrakara puli (\\"tiger among artists\\"). He was a great patron of the arts and Mamallapuram (or Mahabalipuram) stands as a testimony to his patronage of art and architecture. He pioneered rock-cut temples in Mamallapuram, Pallavaram (near Madras), Siyamangalam and Singavaram (North Arcot district), Tiruchi and Mamandur (in Kanchipuram district).. Narsimha is the principal deity of Cave I, while the Cave II, in the complex, is known from later inscriptions as the Saiva Rudravalisvaram Cave. The caves are situated on the banks of Palar river. A tank named Chitramegha tataka, also known as Dusi-Mamandur tank is located behind the caves, which believed to be built Mahendravarman I. The cave contain Tamil Brahmi inscriptions and cave paintings. Cave Temple 1 \\"is approached by a staircase cut into the hill. The façade is made up of two pillars and two pilasters. Two pillars made up of cubes above and below with an octagonal shaft in the middle make up the façade of this cave. There are lotus medallions on the lower and top cubes. Behind these pillars there is a second row of pillars. A central shrine protrudes from the back wall. The pillars are in typical Mahendravarman style.\\" dedicated to Vishnu Mamandur cave temples is the template style of Dravida temple architecture On the northern wall of the mukha-mandapa there is an inscription probably authored by the same king. Lines 12 and 13 suggest that the king ‘wanted to achieve what was not achieved before in the realm of music’. Cave Temple 2, situated south of the first cave, also has an ardha mandapa and mukha mandapa separated by two pillars behind the first row. There are three sanctum sanctorum in this cave temple, dedicated Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. Two steps in front, with a low stone rail shaped like the back of an elephant lead into each garba griha. According to an inscription inside the central sanctum, it is called Uruttiravalisvaram (Rudravalisvaram). Thus Shiva or Rudra would have been the deity of the central sanctum. The dvaarapalas of the central sanctum stand in tribhanga, one hand on the waist and another resting on their heavy clubs which are intertwined with serpents, wearing huge jatabhaaras on their heads, yajnopavita (sacred thread) and ornaments. The Linga in the sanctum indicates that this garba griha was dedicated to Shiva. The dvaarapalas of the southern sanctum stand in tribhanga, with a hand on the waist and a lotus in the other. Wearing a yajnopavita and jatabhaara on their heads, they were obviously intended to be sages or brahmanas, and the deity within must have been Brahma. dedicated to Vishnu, although there is no figure inside. Traces of painting are visible inside the sanctum, suggesting that the cave temples were once painted. There are two inscriptions of Parantaka I Chola inside this cave temple, saying that the caves were called Vruttiravaliswaram and Valiswaram The irrigation tank, Chitramegha tataka, is assumed to have been excavated on the orders of Mahendravarman I Pallava. Cave Temple 3 – Situated south of the previous cave, this is the largest of the four caves. There are several cracks on the pillars, which may be the reason for not finishing this cave. There are five pillars and two pilasters on the façade, in typical Mahendravarman style. The corbel above the pillars is in curved profile. The southern façade has two pillars and two pilasters. Corbels are finished above the pillars, however these are not fully cut in to make the space for circumambulation. This cave has an ardha-mandapa and mukha-mandapa, the two differentiated by two rows of pillars and pilasters. The five shrines at the back of the cave share a common platform, with staircases in front of each, consisting of three steps. The cells are all cubical and empty, with no dvarpalas or inscriptions. This shrine would have had seven cells, five on the back and two on the side. Cave Temple 4 – This is the smallest cave on the hill, unfinished, with a façade of two pillars and two pilasters. The façade suggests a three shrine cave, but the work was stopped due to cracks in the rock and load above the roof.

Rhomaios followed in the footsteps of his grandfather, becoming a judge at the imperial court. Over the course of his career, which began in the reign of Emperor Basil II, he advanced from simple judge (litos krites) to the rank of magistros and the prestigious post of droungarios tes viglas, being perhaps the very first holder of this title as president of the Court of the Hippodrome. He was highly esteemed both during his lifetime and by later legal scholars for his knowledge and skill in decision making. Rhomaios wrote several legal treatises, chiefly comprising statements of verdict, counsel's opinions etc., but most of them have been lost. One of his colleagues, however, selected some parts of his work and, arranging them by subject in 75 titles, published a compendium known as the Peira (\\"experience\\"). The Peira was intended as a textbook. It contains \\"in a loosely associated progression, precepts, definitions, and solutions to problems from all spheres of civil and criminal law\\" (D. Simon), and its compiler tried to deduce general rules that governed Rhomaios' decisions. The Peira remained a popular book until the late Byzantine period, and was often cited by later Byzantine legal scholars.

Geography Ras Muari is part of a 25-kilometer coastal belt of rocky and sandy beaches between Mubarak and Yousuf Goth (Pacha). This part of the coast is property of Sindh Revenue Department. Considered a habitat for endangered whale, dolphin, and turtle species, Ras Muari is also a hatching and feeding ground for turtles. In addition, the coastline has a multitude of offshore fish nurseries. [3][4] Cape Monze Ras Mauri Lighthouse In 1916, the British Government of India, commissioned the construction of Lightship Sindhi (now Ras Muari Lighthouse). Unlike other lighthouses, lightships can be moved from one place to another. Most of the remaining lightships of the world are maintained purely for their historical and novelty value, not for their maritime utility. In 1916, the Lightship Sindhi was a welcome addition to British India's maritime assets. Built at the Royal Indian Navy in Bombay, it was intended to be stationed off the coast of Sindh. During World War I, it sat off the Iranian island of Qais and was very valuable in assisting maritime traffic. After the war, it was stationed off the Hajamrao Creek in the Indus Delta region. Its light is reported to have been visible from as far as 10 miles away. Unlike the nearby Manora Point Lighthouse, Cape Monze lighthouse was not visible from Karachi, or any other popular beach in the area. During its construction, camels were used to transport the necessary materials to the area, otherwise remote from the rest of the territory. The practice has continued to this day.

A key leader of the Communist Party of East Pakistan, Dastidar was jailed for over two decades. Student years and revolutionary struggle Dastidar was born in Dalghat village, Chittagong District. He was the son of Chandra Kumar Dastidar, an officer of the Chittagong Law Court. He passed his I.sc. exam from Chittagong College in 1927. He went on to study at the Jadavpur Engineering and Technology College. He was a member of the Chittagong Jugantar Party, and took part in guerrilla actions against British targets together with Surya Sen, Kalpana Dutta and Pritilata Waddedar. In 1931, during his student years in Calcutta, he was imprisoned. The British authorities charged him with being an associate of guerrilla leader Surya Sen. He was able to complete his B.A. and B.L. degrees whilst in jail. He was released from jail in 1938, but remained interned in his home village until 1941. From 1941 onwards he began practising Law. Community work In Chittagong Dastidar founded the 'Babies Hospital', offering health care to poor children. During the years of war and famine 1942–1945, he organised relief efforts in Chittagong. He was also the organiser of relief efforts in 1947 following the sinking of S.S. Mallard near Cox's Bazar. Jailed legislator Dastidar became a member of the Communist Party of Pakistan in 1948. He was arrested again, and jailed for seven years. In 1954, whilst in jail, he was elected to the East Pakistan Legislative Assembly from a minority reserved seat in Chittagong. He defeated Binod Bihari Dutta of the Congress party. Dastidar was released in 1956. In the Legislative Assembly he tabled a resolution calling for the construction of a memorial tower in honour of the Chittagong rebellion of 18 April 1930, which was passed by the assembly. NAP leader Dastidar organised student, labour and peasants groups in Chittagong. In 1957 Dastidar became a member of the National Awami Party (NAP). Following the declaration of Martial Law in 1958, Dastidar was once again jailed. He was released in 1962. Upon his release from jail he became the president of the Chittagong City branch of NAP. Along with other communist leaders, Dastidar was jailed at the time of the September 1965 Indo-Pakistan war. He was released in 1969, in connection with the ongoing mass protests which forced Ayub Khan to release all political prisoners. After being released he was active in the NAP of Wali Khan. He contested the Chittagong-11 in the provincial assembly elections of 1970, but lost to an Awami League candidate. 1971 Liberation War As the Bangladesh Liberation War broke out in 1971 Dastidar left for India to join the struggle, but died of exhaustion en route.

This is especially the case with people who work in the technology and health care sectors. As of 2014 over 70% of Metro Detroit ethnic Indians who were born outside of the United States have at minimum a bachelor's degree. Economy and commerce Many Indians work in the information technology sector and medical sectors, and by 2014 an increasing demand in the sectors increased immigration of Indians to Metro Detroit. The automobile suppliers that manage information technology contracts with automobile companies hire Indian IT workers. As of 2014, almost half of ethnic Indians in Metro Detroit who were born outside of the United States have annual incomes of over $75,000. Businesses supporting the Indian community include grocery stores, web portal www.miindia.com, AM radio stations, wedding companies, and dress shops. Religion In the late 1970s, many Indian leaders in the community formed a committee to build the first Hindu Temple in Michigan. After years of planning and raising funds, in 1983, the Hare Krishna temple was inaugurated in Detroit. The creation of a religious building is an indicator of these Indian immigrants putting down roots in Michigan especially in the metro Detroit area. The population of South Asians in 1990 was fairly small with around 23,000 Asian-Indians, 1,500 Pakistani, 342 Bangladeshi, and 179 Sri Lankan people out of the total 100,000 Asian population. The presence of Asian Indians was prevalent enough for the census to include them as their own category. As of 2013 Hindu temples and religious centers had been recently established in Detroit, Ada, Canton, Hamtramck, Livonia, Novi, Pontiac, Sterling Heights, and Troy. In 2012 a Hindu temple built for $11 million opened in Troy. The Sri Venkateswara Temple and Cultural Center (SVTCC), a temple mainly catering to Telugu speakers, opened in Novi in 2013. It is the first Michigan Hindu temple to be named after a southern Indian deity.Warikoo, Niraj. \\"New Hindu temple in Novi reflects region's growing Asian-Indian population\\" ().

Culture and recreation The India Day, a celebration of Indian culture sponsored by the India League of America - Michigan, is held annually. The Festival of India is held at Philip A. Hart Plaza in Downtown Detroit. Jaydevi and Bharat Sanghvi founded the festival. It was held regularly in the 1970s, but according to Sarah Klein of the Metro Times, it \\"lost its luster\\" and then was no longer held. Indians moved their cultural festivals to suburban areas as Detroit declined. In 2005, 20 years after the festival closed, the nonprofit United South Asian Promotions (USAP), founded by Gurvinder Singh, Jack Sandhu and Raj Sanghvi, the son of the original founders of the Festival of India, restarted the festival.

S. Durai Senthilkumar and produced by Dhanush, their second collaboration after Ethir Neechal (2013). The film features Sivakarthikeyan and Sri Divya in the lead roles, while Prabhu and Vijay Raaz play supporting roles. The film's music was composed by Anirudh Ravichander. The story revolves around police constable Mathimaran who wants to prove himself as a true, powerful cop by finding ways to solve issues of corruption in the law and order system in the department of police. The film, which commenced filming in April 2014, released on 27 February 2015. In 2018, the film was dubbed in Hindi as Daring Policewala.  Plot  Mathimaran (Sivakarthikeyan) is a police constable who only reports to work and goes home daily without contributing anything useful to the society as his boss, Inspector Sathyamurthy (Prabhu), does not want to get on the wrong side of the upper levels of the police, who are corrupt and politically influenced, and is also unwilling to rock the present system due to past experience. Mathimaran and his fellow policemen never get any cases as a result, much to his irritation. Mathimaran falls in love with Divya (Sri Divya), who works as a nurse in a hospital, but hides his occupation from her as her family hates police officers. With her help, he finds out about an illegal organ donation racket orchestrated by Durai Arasan (Vijay Raaz), a politician, and Dr. Devasagayam (Yog Japee), who is the chairman of the hospital where Divya works. They capture sick and injured migrant workers from North India, make them brain dead by administering them carbon monoxide instead of oxygen, and then harvest their organs, which they sell abroad for huge amounts of money. The organ donation scam gives Mathimaran his first real case, and he takes it on with enthusiasm after Sathyamurthy and Durai's estranged father Singaperumal (Nagineedu), who had threatened to expose his son's misdeeds, are killed in a bomb blast orchestrated by Durai. Mathimaran first confronts Devasagayam, who commits suicide, but not before admitting his role in the scam and giving detailed information about it. He then decides to confront Durai and get him arrested, but problem is that there is not enough evidence against Durai except Devasagayam's word, and Devasagayam is dead. He tries to get more information about Durai's role in the scam incognito. Unfortunately, Durai soon finds out that Mathimaran is after him, and a cat-and-mouse game begins between the two. In the process, Mathimaran is suspended from duty, as the police commissioner (Jeeva Ravi) is close to Durai. Undaunted, he manages to expose the scam and Durai's involvement in it to the media, but Durai wriggles out of arrest. Mathimaran decides to finish off Durai to end the scam once and for all. He creates a ruckus during a felicitation function for Durai. In the chaos that ensues, he shoots Durai in the leg and gives him the same treatment which had been meted out to the North Indian workers: administering him carbon monoxide and then harvesting his organs after he is declared brain dead. Durai's death is covered up as a terrorist attack. Mathimaran is eventually promoted to Inspector in reward for his efforts in thwarting the organ donation scam. He also gets accepted by Divya's family, despite being a police officer, and marries Divya.

In a 2014 research project Barej, Rödel, Loader & Schmitz separated the genus from the established genus Petropedetes and separated the new family from the established family Petropedetidae. Taxonomy and affinities The species had originally been assigned to the genus Petropedetes in the Petropedetidae, a family of so-called torrent frogs of Africa, so the type species is Petropedetes natator Boulenger, 1905. However, recent morphological and genomic investigation showed the species not only to be cladistically alien to the Petropedetidae, but to all other existing anuran families as well. Furthermore, the family Odontobatrachidae turned out to be fairly ancient, estimated to have originated in the mid-Cretaceous period, some 80 Ma - 90 Ma ago. Consequently, a new family and genus were assigned, respectively Odontobatrachidae and Odontobatrachus. The details of the evolutionary history of the taxon however, still are open to alternative lines of interpretation.Barej, Michael F. Schmitz, Andreas. Günther, Rainer. Loader, Simon P. Mahlow, Kristin. Rödel, Mark-Oliver. The first endemic West African vertebrate family – a new anuran family highlighting the uniqueness of the Upper Guinean biodiversity hotspot. Frontiers in Zoology 2014, 11:8 Description Like many species of tadpoles inhabiting fast-flowing mountain streams, the larvae of Odontobatrachus are streamlined, with a flattened body shape, and with large sucker-like mouths adapted to attachment to rocks in defiance of powerful currents. Differential diagnosis of adult Odontobatrachus is supported by a range of features that distinguish the species from other local species of Anura, and from the Petropedetidae in particular. In external appearance they are moderate-sized frogs with a body length of up to about 65 mm. The skin is granular in texture with glandular ridges. There is no lateral line organ, but nuptial pads are present in the male. The maxillae (upper jaws) are densely set with sharply pointed, somewhat recurved teeth, some of them also occurring on the vomer. In contrast each mandible bears just one large, sharply pointed recurved odontoid tusk.Barej, Michael F. Schmitz, Andreas. Günther, Rainer. Loader, Simon P. Mahlow, Kristin. Rödel, Mark- Oliver. The first endemic West African vertebrate family – a new anuran family highlighting the uniqueness of the Upper Guinean biodiversity hotspot; Additional file. [www.biomedcentral.com/content/supplementary/1742-9994-11-8-S1.pdf] It has been confirmed that Odontobatrachus do at least on occasion swallow frogs, but it is not certain whether their dentition reflects their being either specialist or opportunistic predators of relatively large frogs.Steiner, Gesine. Pressestelle. Museum für Naturkunde - Leibniz-Institut für Evolutions- und Biodiversitätsforschung. 02/04/2014 10:26 The Petropedetidae differ from Odontobatrachus in several ways, including that they lack tusks on the mandibles and that they either lack vocal sacs, or, if they have one it is median; Odontobatrachus has lateral vocal sacs.

They frequent forested country close to mountain streams with strong currents and rapids. The distribution is patchy, but where the species does occur it often is plentiful. Human settlements and activities such as logging, agriculture and mining pose ecological threats to the species, causing the loss of forest habitat, though there are some conserved areas.The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2013.2 Petropedetes natator (Sierra Leone Water Frog) References Category:Odontobatrachidae Category:Amphibian genera Category:Frogs of Africa Category:Amphibians of West Africa ","title":"Odontobatrachus"},{"id":"42155461","text":"Oonops amoenus is a spider species found in France.

Prior to his work with the Spurs, Schoening broadcast for the Texas Longhorns for 12 years, calling football, basketball, and baseball games. Schoening is a four-time winner of the Associated Press \\"Top Texas Play-by-Play Award,\\" and also won the 2014 Texas Sportscaster of the Year Award from the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. In addition to his work with the Longhorns and Spurs, he has also broadcast National Football League, Major League Baseball, and arena football games. Early life Schoening grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and decided at an early age that he wanted to be a broadcaster. One of his early influences was By Saam, who was broadcasting games for the Philadelphia Phillies when Schoening was growing up. Schoening attended West Catholic High School and one year at Temple University, before transferring to the American Academy of Broadcasting in Philadelphia. After graduating from the six-month program, he got his first job in radio in Illinois. Early career Schoening worked in Pana, Illinois for about a year, before moving to Lamesa, Texas. In Lamesa, he did radio broadcasts for the Lamesa High School Golden Tornados, including football, basketball, and baseball games. He spent three years in Lamesa before moving again, this time to Huntsville, Texas. Schoening began in Huntsville at age 23, broadcasting games for Sam Houston State University, including basketball, football, and a little baseball. He stayed in Huntsville for six years, from 1983 to 1989. University of Texas In 1989, Schoening was hired to broadcast sports for the University of Texas in Austin. During his first three years in Austin, Schoening served as the color analyst on Texas Longhorns football and basketball, with play-by-play announcers Brad Sham and Jerry Trupiano. After Sham and Trupiano left, Schoening was hired to take over play-by-play for both Longhorn football and basketball, a position he would hold for nine years (through 2001). During this time, Schoening's primary color commentator was Craig Way. Schoening also did play-by-play for Longhorn baseball for all 12 years he was in Austin. During his time in Austin, Schoening also hosted an afternoon sports radio talk show, first at KLBJ, and then at KVET, after the latter gained the rights to broadcast Longhorn games.http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/1997/09/08/tidbits.html?page=all He sometimes had co-hosts for these shows, including Jeff Ward and Craig Way. One of these talk shows titled \\"Sportsday,\\" which Schoening co-hosted with Ward, won a 1996 \\"Best of Austin\\" award from the Austin Chronicle for \\"Best Talk Radio Show.\\" San Antonio Spurs In September 2001, Schoening was hired as the radio voice of the San Antonio Spurs. Because of the timing of the hire so close to college football season, Schoening called games for both the Spurs and Longhorn football during the fall of 2001. As of the 2019-2020 NBA season, Schoening is in his 19th season with the Spurs. During that time, the Spurs have won four NBA championships (in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014). In addition to calling games on the radio, Schoening has also written a blog for the official Spurs website, entitled \\"20 Second Timeout.\\" Personal Schoening lives in Austin with his wife, Gerry.

His professional career was devoted to the study of the distribution of vegetation as determined by soil and climate conditions. His contributions to the plant biology world set the groundwork for modern studies and his books are regarded as classics by botanists worldwide. Early life and education Shreve, the son of Henry and Helen Garrison Shreve, was born in Easton, Maryland. After receiving his preparatory education at George School, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, Shreve earned his BA at Johns Hopkins University in 1901. He earned his Ph.D. from the same university in 1905. From 1904 to 1908, Shreve conducted a botanical survey of the state of Maryland.  Career  From 1905 to 1906, and again in 1909, Shreve studied the mountain vegetation of Jamaica. In 1906, he became an associate professor of botany at Goucher College, and remained there until 1908, when he moved to Tucson, Arizona, to work at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Desert Library. From 1911 to 1919, Shreve worked as an editor of the botanical scientific journal Plant World. In 1914, Shreve published his book A Montane Rain-forest. In 1915, he helped found the Ecological Society of America, where he served as a secretary-treasurer until 1919, and as president, in 1921. In 1926, Shreve worked as an editor of the book Naturalist's Guide to the Americas. In 1928, Shreve was placed in charge of Desert Investigations of the Carnegie Institution, and in 1932 he began floristics studies on the Sonoran Desert region. He served as vice president of the Association of American Geographers in 1940, and published \\"The Desert Vegetation of North America\\" in Botanical Review. He retired in 1946.  Personal life  His religious affiliation was with the Society of Friends. Politically, he was a Republican. His hobby was collecting and studying stamps. He married Edith Coffin on June 17, 1909 in Florence, AL (aged 30), and had a daughter, Margaret. He died in Tucson, Arizona in 1950. Publications *The Plant Life of Maryland.

The trilogy takes its name from the secret agency that is central to the plot. In 2013, Paramount Pictures bought the movie rights for the series, and a film adaptation of Annihilation was made with Alex Garland as writer-director. The film was released in 2018. \\"Area X\\" In the series, Southern Reach is a secret agency that manages expeditions into an area known as Area X. The area is an uninhabited and abandoned section of the United States which nature is gradually reclaiming. It is the main setting for Annihilation. Influences VanderMeer has said that the main inspiration for Area X was a hike through St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge. However, he has also said that dreams inspired such elements as the writing in the tower from Annihilation. Moreover, VanderMeer has cited a number of books as having an influence on Southern Reach such as The Other Side of the Mountain by Michel Bernanos. Release The trilogy was released in quick succession over an 8-month period in what has been called an innovative \\"Netflix-inspired strategy\\".

Biography  = Early years = Nájera's parents were Vicente Lucio, a Spanish merchant based in Mexico, and Gertrudis Nájera, a woman from a middle-class family from Veracruz. Rafael Lucio lost his father at an early age. He began his studies in Xalapa, and later, when his mother remarried to a doctor, Manuel Salas, the family moved to the city of San Luis Potosi. There, he continued his schooling and his vocation for medicine began. = Studies = In 1838, he enrolled in the Establishment of Medical Sciences, in Mexico City, where he obtained a position in practical exercises of operative medicine. He completed his educational career with notable success, and in 1842, he earned his medical degree, having passed his examination brilliantly. Months later, when the young doctor was just twenty-four, he was appointed Director of the San Lazaro Hospital in the capital of the Republic, a position he held for seventeen years with great dedication, efficiency and humanitarianism. = Medical and scientific = During his tenure at the San Lazaro Hospital, he dedicated himself to the study and research of a disease that was very common among patients attending the institution; this illness was known back then as Saint Lazarus illness, or elephantiasis of the Greeks (leprosy). The disease first manifested symptoms such as inflamed reddish spots on the skin, later changing to a red wine color, and finally becoming ulcerations. Dr. Rafael Lucio gave this illness the name spotted Leprosy. In 1845, Dr. Lucio was appointed assistant professor in the Faculty of Medicine and two years later, he was given the chair of legal medicine, however he stayed there only briefly since he quickly acquired the chair of internal pathology. In 1851, he reported his observations and research on this disease to the National Academy of Medicine. His work was so clear and comprehensive that it formed the basis and motivation for other notable physicians, such as Fernando Latapí and Jean Charles Faget, who continued to research a cure for this terrible disease, a goal that was achieved in the early 1940s. In recognition for Dr. Rafael Lucio's valuable contributions the disease was named Diffuse leprosy of Lucio and Latapí. Throughout his life, this man of science devoted himself to the study of medicine. In 1855 and 1868, he traveled to Europe to study the progress of medical science in those countries. Upon his return from both journeys, he implemented and shared what he had learned, especially in surgery and everything related to it. The reforms he introduced in this area represented a significant advance in medical practice in Mexico. In October 1870, he made medical visits for several weeks to the National Palace, and collaborated with other physicians who were taking care of the President Benito Juarez.Years later, on July 18, 1872, he went with Gabino Barreda to see the president on his deathbed, although there was little they could do. That same day, Rafael Lucio, Gabino Barreda and Ignacio Alvarado declared President Juárez dead and signed his death certificate. His relationship with the Emperor Maximilian was very close. Najera treated him for the symptoms he was suffering from, and he earned the gratitude of the latter, as well as the decoration of the Grand Cross of the Order of Guadalupe. Dr. Rafael Lucio was a long-time professor at the School of Medicine. In addition to his wisdom and vast experience, he showed an ease of expression and remarkable clarity in his classes; his unassuming manners, his kindness and his spotless morality must be added to this, all qualities that made him an exemplary teacher. In his private practice, he was widely known for his altruism and his humanitarian behavior. He attended to all his patients with the same care and dedication, regardless of the social class to which they belonged, or whether or not they could afford to pay his fees. Among his colleagues, he enjoyed great prestige and recognition. They often wanted to know his opinion on difficult cases, and he always gave a wise and generous response. Dr. Rafael Lucio was truly devoted to his profession of medical service, giving aid and comfort to anyone who needed it, and in response people gave their love and respect. = Death = On May 30, 1886, Dr. Rafael Lucio Nájera died at age 66, in Mexico City and his body was buried in the Tepeyac Pantheon, where they laid his remains alongside those of his wife. In recognition of his high virtues as a man and citizen, and his outstanding work as a physician and scientist, a statue of him was erected in the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City. Decades later, one of the streets in Colonia Doctores was named after him. In order to honor the memory of such a meritorious Xalapan, the people of Veracruz named one of the main streets of his hometown, a colony of the city, a neighboring municipality and its county seat, formerly called San Miguel Soldier, after him.  National Academy of Medicine of Mexico  Rafael Nájera, together with the other distinguished gentlemen Miguel F. Jiménez, Gabino Barreda, Eduardo Liceaga, Joseph Terrés, Manuel Martínez Baez, and Gustavo Baz, founded the National Academy of Medicine of Mexico in 1864, and they also managed to establish large medical institutions in the country. Nájera was also president of this institution in 1869 and 1880.

The area is home to the Boyne Navigation, the Battle of the Boyne Interpretive Centre and the Mary McAleese Boyne Valley Bridge (which carries the M1 motorway). Navigation The townland represents the furthest tidal reach on the River Boyne at a point called the \\"Curly Hole\\". Curly Hole is also a fishing location. Prior to the 12th century, this was the lowest crossing point of the Boyne. The Abbey of Mellifont owned the lands and fisheries here at dissolution in 1539. It was described then as \\"Oldebryge. 26 fishermen with 26 boats de Corrio (sc.corachs) paying £13.6.8\\". The Irish coracle was used for salmon fishing at this location up to at least the first half of the 20th century. One of the last coracles made locally was made in 1928 by Michael O'Brien of Oldbridge, for Adolf Mahr director of the National Museum of Ireland. Battle of the Boyne Site Former Boyne Obelisk (pictured c.1890), which was erected near Oldbridge in 1736 to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne. It was destroyed in 1923. The site of the Battle of the Boyne extends over an area west of the town of Drogheda. In the County Development Plan for 2000, Meath County Council rezoned the land at the eastern edge of Oldbridge, at the site of the main Williamite crossing, to residential status. A subsequent planning application for a development of over 700 houses was granted by Meath County Council and this was appealed by local historians to An Bord Pleanala (The Planning Board). In March 2008 after a long appeal process, An Bord Pleanala approved permission for this development to proceed. However, due to the current economic climate in Ireland, no work has yet started on this development. The Battle of the Boyne Interpretive Centre is approximately to the west of the main crossing point, on Oldbridge Estate. This facility was redeveloped in 2008 and is open to tourists. In early 2007, the newly elected First Minister of Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley, was invited to visit the battle site by the then Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern. Following the invitation, Paisley commented that \\"such a visit would help to demonstrate how far we have come when we can celebrate and learn from the past so the next generation more clearly understands.\\" The visit took place in May 2007, and a tree was planted in the grounds of Oldbridge House to mark the occasion.

The offside rules are virtually the same in bandy as the offside rules in association football (therefore, pictures of a green football field are used here to illustrate it). In bandy, they are regulated in section 11 of the Bandy Playing Rules set up by the Federation of International Bandy (FIB).  Application  The blue forward on the left of the diagram is in an offside position as he is in front of both the second-to-last defender (marked by the dotted line) and the ball. Note that this does not necessarily mean he is committing an offside offence; it only becomes an offence if the ball were to be played to him at this moment, whether or not he is in an offside position when he receives the ball, as he could receive the ball in an onside position but he'd still have committed an offside offence. forward in the penalty box of the diagram is not in an offside position, as he is behind the ball, despite the fact that he is in front of all but one of his opponents. The application of the offside rule may be considered in three steps: offside position, offside offence and offside sanction. = Offside position = A player is in an offside position if three conditions are met: first, the player must be in the opposing team's half of the rink. Second, the player must be in front of the ball, i.e. closer to the end-side of the field than the ball. And third, there must be fewer than two opposing players between him and the opposing goal line, with the goalkeeper counting as an opposing player for these purposes. It is not necessary that the goalkeeper be one of the last two opponents. Any attacker that is level with or behind the ball is not in an offside position and may never be sanctioned for an offside offence. =Offside offence= It is regulated in section 11.2 of the Rules, that the referee shall stop the game because of offside, if a player receives the ball in offside position, or if he when he is in an offside position disturbs the play or the opponent, or if the player in his position gains an advantage in the game. The player must be in this position at the moment the ball is played. In comment section C11.9, we are reminded that an offside situation \\"shall be judged at the moment the ball is played, and not in the moment when it was received. This does not mean that an offside shall be called immediately. It might be an advantage for the referee to see how the situation develops.\\" FIB has clarified in section 11.2 in fine and in the comment section C11.5 of the Bandy Playing Rules that a player who does not participate in the game and does not disturb his opponent, shall not be stopped for offside. The offside rule also applies to free-strokes, penalty shots, face-offs and goal-throws; this is clarified in comment section C11.1 of the Rules. A player, who is in offside position, can be stopped for offside when he receives the ball from a teammate even if the ball on its way touches an opponent (C11.2) but the player shall not be called for an offside position if he receives the ball played from an opponent (C11.3), which of course may leave it up to the referee to deem if a ball passing a defending player's stick was just touching it or if the defender was playing the ball. = Offside sanction = When the game has been stopped because of offside, according to section 11.2 of the Rules the defending team shall have a free- stroke. The free-stroke is to be executed from the place where the offside infringement took place, that is, where the off-sided player was when the ball was passed to him.

It is owned by Knut Ola Staver. The club was founded in the year of 1963 as Bærum Basketball Club, commonly referred to as simply Bærum BBK. It is historically known to be one of the most successful teams in the BLNO, tied with Asker Aliens B.C. for the most league championships. Bærum Basket has won 4 BLNO league championships and 1 Norwegian Cup dating back to the creation of the BLNO league. Some of the most prominent players that have been with Bærum Basket in the recent years include: Stian Mjos, Keith Thompson, and Donald Oatis. These players have all been playing under the coaching of Pal Berg.  History  = Establishment = In the spring of 1963, Jan Petter Hansen— a physical education teacher at Valler Upper Secondary School— initiated the first official basketball club in the entire country of Norway, with the help of the Norwegian Confederation of Sports (NIF). Known as the Bærum Basketball Club, or the Bærum BBK, the club first consisted of eleven players. = Rise of Bærum BBK (1964–1978) = Bærum BBK earned its first prize in the spring of 1964, the \\"Fair Play Trophy\\", an inspiration that would start a whole new era in the entire club's history. Interest in the sport rapidly increased in the Eikeli area of Bærum, giving the team more and more space for young talent on their roster due to the high recruitment rate. This was also the period of time in which the club was seeing an increase in the number of Americans on the court, helping them win their first ever tournament, in this case the 1966 Coca-Cola Cup. The Coca- Cola Cup was an opening tournament that took place in the fall. Bærum BBK's first league championship came in mid-1968, a period that is widely considered to be the club's first and greatest triumph.

Owned by CBRE, the center is along Interstate 96, with the Twelve Oaks Mall on the other side of the interstate. History Groundbreaking occurred in 1986 and opening occurred in 1987. Patricia Karevich, the Mayor of Novi at the time, stated that the opening was the beginning of a Downtown for the city. Barbara G. Louie, author of No. VI on the Trail: A History of Novi, Michigan for the Novi Historical Commission, wrote that as a result of the development, \\"the focal point was drawn again to what was once Novi's main business district.\\" Trammell Crow developed the commercial section of the mall along with the Lake Pointe Corporate Center. The commercial and business centers took a plot of land. This was one of the Trammell Crow company's two major projects in Michigan at the time. Historically the complex had an eight-screen movie theater. It was managed by the chain Goodrich until the management was given to an Indian couple on December 1, 2005. The couple, Sonali and Rakesh Gangwani, began screening Bollywood and other Indian films on a daily basis there. The center experienced financial difficulties in a period until 2011 due to the closure of Borders, CompUSA, and Mervyn's. In 2010 its owner at the time, the Chicago firm General Growth Properties, was in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Wal-Mart announced that it was considering opening a store on the site of the former Mervyn's at the center. The theater and several other businesses closed in 2010 as part of the redevelopment of Novi Town Center related to the Wal-Mart, and the theater did not reopen. The theater was not a part of the plans for expansion, and because of that, the theater did not pay any rent during its final three years of operation. In 2011 the Novi City Council voted 5-2 to give a special land-use permit to Wal-Mart and 6-1 to a preliminary site plan approval to Wal-Mart; these votes allowed the development of the store to proceed. The Wal-Mart opened in 2012, making it the 86th superstore in Michigan. The Wal-Mart store, on a lot, takes up of space. Greta Guest of the Detroit Free Press stated that new retailers planned to open as the Wal-Mart was developed.

Built about 1865, it is a distinctive local example of Italianate commercial architecture, and is the largest 19th-century commercial building in the village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Jacob Noyes Block is located about one block east of the modest 19th-century commercial heart of Suncook, on the north side of Glass Street at its junction with Church Street. It is a handsome vernacular brick building with Italianate styling, three stories in height, with a flat roof. The ground floor has two storefronts, each with a recessed entry flanked by display windows, each of these elements set in a round-arch opening. The storefronts flank the main building entrance, also recessed in a round-arch opening. Upper-story windows are set in segmented-arch openings, headed by corbelled brick hoods. The windows are set in what appears as a recessed panel, defined by corner pilasters and brick beltcourses above the first floor and below the roof eaves. The block was built by Jacob Noyes, a trader, as a speculative venture, in c. 1865. Noyes apparently believed that commercial development would proceed from the main village center of Suncook up Glass Street, but it never did, and the building (then as now), stands isolated from other period commercial buildings. The meeting space on the building's upper floor is also notable as the site of meetings of the secret Société Sainte Jean Baptiste, a social and political organization of French-Canadians who had come in large numbers to work in the Suncook mills.

It was originally used as a post office and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Old Post Office. It was also included in the Concord Civic District in 1983. Description and history New Hampshire's Legislative Office Building is located just west of the state capitol, occupying an entire city block bounded by North State Street, Capitol Street, Park Street, and Green Street. It is a large two-story granite structure, built in the Richardsonian Romanesque style, with a Chateauesque hip roof crowned by iron cresting. The walls are finished in a rough-hewn texture, although the walls of the raised basement are smooth. The main facade faces east, and is dominated by an arcade of three squat Gothic arches supported by smooth round pillars. The main portion of the building was built between 1884 and 1889 for the federal government to a design by James Riggs Hill, the United States Treasury Department's Supervising Architect. The building was twice extended, in 1913 and 1938. When first built, it housed not only the post office, but other federal offices and the federal district court.

It was reissued in 1989 as a single CD. Background Following a successful three-year stint with the Art Ensemble of Chicago in Europe, in 1971 Mitchell came back to Chicago and moved to a farm in Bath, Michigan, just northeast of Lansing. L-R-G / The Maze / S II Examples brought sound explorations he had made in Michigan together with the earlier innovations made by the Art Ensemble. In 1976 he found a happy medium between city and country in Madison, Wisconsin. According to Chuck Nessa, who produced the album, \\"We spent over a year preparing for that record. I went up to Roscoe's place in Wisconsin every weekend to go over that stuff.\\"Negotiating \\"The Maze\\" by Peter Margasak at Chicago Reader Composition \\"L-R-G\\" (which stands for Leo Smith, Roscoe Mitchell and George Lewis), is a 37-minute trio for sixteen different instruments grouped by type: woodwinds (Mitchell), high brass (Smith) and low brass (Lewis). For this piece and \\"The Maze,\\" Mitchell uses the term \\"sound collages\\".Original Liner Notes by John B. Litweiller He took inventory of every possible sound the musicians could produce, then organized the sounds into pieces based on texture, without the restriction of fixed tempos. \\"L-R-G\\" was performed once more, not long after the album came out, at New York Public Theater. \\"The Maze\\" is a 21-minute octet for all kinds of percussion including a lot of unconventional instruments. Mitchell used on the piece AACM stars as Anthony Braxton and Henry Threadgill to serve as percussionists, together with Art Ensemble members Don Moye, Joseph Jarman, and Malachi Favors. Chuck Nessa remembers that it took the musicians more than four hours just to set up all those instruments, but that they nailed the piece in one live take. \\"The Maze\\" would never be performed again until two decades later, when Mitchell played all three pieces from the album at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago. \\"S II Examples\\" is a 17-minute exploration of multi-phonics on the curved soprano saxophone. The piece was originally designed to be played by a trio with Jarman and Braxton, but when they got together Mitchell discovered that one example that could be done in his curved soprano saxophone couldn't be played on their straight sopranos, so he decided to record it as a solo piece. Reception In his review for AllMusic, Dave Lewis says about the album that \\"is a splendidly recorded and mastered CD, and inasmuch as Roscoe Mitchell as classical composer is concerned, this is very close to where it truly starts.\\" The Penguin Guide to Jazz says that \\"it's a rather bewitching set altogether, and a useful notebook on what Chicago's playing élite were looking into at the period.\\" Track listing :All compositions by Roscoe Mitchell # \\"L-R-G\\" - 36:37 # \\"The Maze\\" - 20:45 # \\"S II Examples\\" - 17:31 Personnel ;L-R-G *Roscoe Mitchell - piccolo, flute, oboe, clarinet, soprano sax, alto sax, tenor sax, baritone sax, bass saxophone *Wadada Leo Smith - trumpet, pocket trumpet, flugelhorn *George Lewis - sousaphone, Wagner tuba, alto trombone, tenor trombone ;The Maze *Thurman Barker - drums, cow bells, conga drum, gong, glockenspiel, hand bells, marimba, slap stick, triangle, whistle *Malachi Favors - log drum, gong, balafon, cans, hand bells, shakers, seal horn, tambourine, temple gong, zither *Roscoe Mitchell - bugle glockenspiel, bicycle horns, balafon, cow bells, cymbals, conga drum, cycle sprocket, dinner chimes, dome bells, frying pans, finger cymbals, gongs, hanging bell, large swinging bell, press horn, Swiss cow bells, swinging bells, swinging Swiss cow bells, thunder sheet, tuned cymbals, temple blocks, triangles, wood blocks, wood desk, zizzle cymbals *Henry Threadgill - cymbal gongs, finger cymbals, gong, garbage can bottoms, hubkaphone, hand bells, plumbing brass, rhythm sticks, hackbrett *Joseph Jarman - A bell, balafon, bike horns, cymbals, Chinese cymbals, conga drums, chimes, cymbal rack, conch shell, drums, gongs, hand bells, marimba, tom tom, vibraphone, temple gongs *Anthony Braxton - bass drum, cymbals, glockenspiel, garbage can machine, marimba can machine, marimba, orchestra bells, sloshing can machine, snare drum, wash tub machine, xylophone *Douglas Ewart - bamboo table, cymbals, cow bells, large chimes, small chimes, door bell, gongs, hanging bells, little bells, marimba, metal xylophone, winding bell, wooden cow bell, zizzle cymbal *Don Moye - drums, balafon, cow bells, conga drums, cymbal rack, gongs, hand bells, little horns, marimba, triangle, temple gongs, wood blocks ;S II Examples *Roscoe Mitchell - soprano saxophone References Category:1978 albums Category:Roscoe Mitchell albums Category:Nessa Records albums ","title":"L-R-G / The Maze / S II Examples"},{"id":"42156169","text":"Dagadapally (or chinna dagada) (Telugu: Telugu) is a village in Veepangandla Mandal in Mahbubnagar district of Telangana State, India.

Built in 1791, and altered in the 1840s, the meeting house is one of a small number of 18th-century meeting houses to survive in northern New England. The building was moved from its original site in 1942 to make way for a flood control project and was given modern footings for the granite foundation in 1979. The building, owned by the Society for the Preservation of the Old Meeting House, now serves as a local museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Old Webster Meeting House is located in the village center of Webster, on the east side of Battle Street (New Hampshire Route 127) a short way north of its junction with Long Street. It is a 2½-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is seven bays wide, with 16-over-12 sash windows in most of the bays. The entrance is in the center bay, framed by simple Greek Revival trim and topped by a transom window. The interior has an entry vestibule, from which stairs rise on either side to the second floor. The lower level was historically used for town meetings and functions, while the upper level was used for religious activities. A row of horse sheds, in length, is located behind the building. The area that is now Webster was first incorporated as part of Boscawen. Its residents petitioned for separation from Boscawen on the grounds that it was too far to the town's original meeting house; the town's response was to build this \\"westerly\\" meeting house in 1791, modeled closely on the original 1769 meeting house. Its early use and maintenance were shared by the town and the local Congregationalists, a situation that lasted until 1823. In that year, a second church group objected to the Congregationalists' use of the building, resulting in the latter group's construction of the nearby Webster Congregational Church. This building was thereafter occupied by the town and the Christian Union Society, who in 1844 decided to formally partition the building. This resulted in a number of alterations: what had been a gallery space on the second level was converted into a full second floor, and exterior projecting staircase enclosures were removed in favor of internal stairs. The main entrance's Greek Revival decoration also dates to this time. In 1941 the building was slated for demolition as part of a flood control project. A local group was formed to preserve the building, and it was moved to its present location in 1942. It now serves as a local history museum.

These plans were foiled in April 1965 before the coup could be carried out. Background After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 the new Soviet leadership under Nikita Khrushchev began a process of liberalization and de-Stalinization. This created a power struggle within the party between the Hardliners who opposed the reforms and Khrushchev's supporters. Internationally the divide between the now-liberal minded Soviets and the hardline leadership of China became apparent in the early 60s with the Sino- Soviet split. In Bulgaria, the Stalinist Vulko Chervenkov was dismissed from the leadership of the party in 1954 and then from his position as Prime Minister in 1956. The new General-Secretary (Zhivkov) began to implement de- Stalinization in the Bulgarian Communist Party. Anton Yugov succeeded Chervenkov as Prime Minister, but was removed in 1962 — succeeded by Zhivkov — allowing the latter to remain the unchallenged leader of Bulgaria. Preparations In October 1964 two members of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, Ivan Todorov-Gorunia and Tzolo Krastev, began to plot against Zhivkov. The conspirators were hardline communists, influenced by Mao Zedong of China, who denounced the leadership of the Communist Party for having become \\"opportunists\\" and for following the \\"revisionist\\" Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev. Although Khrushchev was removed on 14 October, the conspirators aimed at establishing a more Marxist-Leninist Bulgaria and to lessen its subservience to the USSR. Several dozen officers joined, including the commander of the Sofia garrison General Tsvyatko Anev; the head of the personal cabinet of the Мinister of Defence, Colonel Ivan Velchev; the deputy chief of the Мain Political Directorate of the Bulgarian People's Army General Мicho Ermenkov; and the chief of department at the General Staff, General Lyuben Dinov. The plan was to execute the coup with the aid of the Bulgarian People's Army during the plenum of the Central Committee of the BCP. They planned to use the tank brigade based around Sofia, the Guard Division and the First Army headquarters in Sofia as a show of force against the party leadership. Discovery of the plot The conspirators aroused suspicion and a counter-intelligence operation carried out between 28 March and 12 April 1965 uncovered the scheme and arrested those involved. Some sources say that the leaders of the plot were being spied on even before 1964 because they were not fully trusted by the party leadership. The first arrested was General Anev on 8 April 1965. Following his arrest the coup leader, Todorov-Gorunia, committed suicide at home. On 12 April the rest of the plotters were arrested. Nine of them were court martialed and were given sentences varying from 8 to 15 years, and another 192 people were given administrative penalties. Domestic response Rumors spread throughout Sofia about the suicide of a high-ranked party official and about the possibility of a plot against the current leadership. The state-controlled media, however, denounced all rumors as \\"fantastic fabrications and malicious propaganda.\\" Rehabilitation On 15 June 1990 the Military College of the Supreme Court rehabilitated the convicted conspirators, stating: \\"These offenses were socially necessary and aimed at the overthrow of a regime, which has absolutely been proven to of had been dictatorial\\".

In March 2014, Eurogamer's Elio Cossu wrote, \\"The emulation, even at such an early stage, was a remarkable achievement, considering the complexity of the hardware of the PS3.\\" =Atlus DMCA takedown notice= RPCS3 received significant media attention in April 2017 for its ability to emulate Persona 5, achieving playability prior to the game's Western release date. In September 2017, Persona developer Atlus issued a DMCA takedown notice against RPCS3's Patreon page. The action was motivated by the Patreon page making frequent mentions on the emulator's progress on emulating Persona 5. The demand, however, was settled by only removing all Persona 5 references from the page.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is considered the \\"centerpiece\\" of the Blountville local historic district. Deery Inn is a two- story Federal-style building with 19 rooms. The original building was a log structure, built in the 1780s or 1790s, that served travelers passing through the area on the Great Stage Road. William Deery, an Irishman from Ulster, acquired the property in 1801. He expanded the building to include a general store and tavern, with hotel rooms on the second story. The building's 19 rooms include a large entrance hall, a gathering room, a dining room, a library, two kitchens, three bathrooms, two attics, a cellar, four bedrooms for the family, and three sleeping rooms for travelers. There are two chimneys. The front of the building has three entrance doors and 13 windows whose glass panes are arranged in a nine-over-six configuration. Deery prospered as a businessman. In addition to the inn, he owned and operated stores in several East Tennessee communities, a stagecoach line that had eight stagecoaches and 53 teams of horses as of 1821, and a steamboat service between Knoxville and Chattanooga. He died in 1845. Notable people who are recorded as having stayed at the inn in its early history include Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, Andrew Johnson, the Marquis de LaFayette (on his U.S. travels in 1824–25), and Louis Phillipe Orleans, King of France. During the Civil War Gideon and Mary Elizabeth Cate leased the property and operated the inn under the name Cates' Hotel. Several surrounding buildings, including the Sullivan County courthouse, were destroyed by fire during the Battle of Blountville, but the inn survived because Cates had used bribery to get the Union and Confederate commanders to spare his inn. Gideon and Mary Cates purchased the property after the Civil War, and owned it until the 1880s. In 1887, the inn was sold to Amanda Pearson, whose family was to own it until 1940. The property was operated as an inn until 1930. At some time during the Pearson family ownership, the inn building housed a post office. Virginia Byars Caldwell bought the inn in 1940. She undertook to restore the property to its early 19th-century appearance. She also moved several old log structures onto the back of the property, including a smokehouse, the offices of the King Ironworks, a spring house, and an early law office. The Old Deery Inn is now owned by the government of Sullivan County. A substantial restoration project was undertaken in 2007. The inn is managed by the Sullivan County Historical Preservation Association and is open for group tours.

He published more than ten books between 1950 and 2007. Villoro was born in Barcelona on 3 November 1922 to a Spanish father and a Mexican mother. Between 1983 and 1987, he was a delegate for Mexico in UNESCO. He was named an honorary member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua in 2007. Luis Villoro received the Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes in 1986, for his effort in the field of history, social sciences, and philosophy. In 2004 he received an honorary doctorate from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Villoro died from respiratory failure on 5 March 2014 in Mexico City. He was 91 years old. Thought The main themes of the philosophy of Luis Villoro are the following: metaphysical understanding of otherness, the limits and scope of reason, the link between knowledge and power, the search for communion with others, ethical reflection on injustice, the defense of respect for cultural differences, and the critical dimension of philosophical thinking. His long intellectual career can be divided into three stages: a first stage of the particular or of the historical philosophy, a second stage of the universal or theoretical philosophy, and \\"synthesis” or practical philosophy. Among the topics Villoro studied were Indigenous American philosophy, the thought of Ludwig Wittgenstein and of René Descartes, he also dedicated important texts to reflection about silence. He conducted an important study on movements related to native culture in Mexico, what he called \\"the independence revolution,\\" in line with the multicultural nature of Mexico, and a reflection on the need to think of an expanded democracy following the uprising of the EZLN in 1994.

Production notes Pointed Accounts of People You Know was recorded in May 1983 at Samurai Sound Lab in Davis, California, a studio co-owned by Dave Gill, the band's new drummer, who replaced Michael Irwin. The lineup included Scott Miller on guitar and lead vocals, Nancy Becker on keyboards, Gill on drums and Fred Juhos on bass. Two of the EP's six songs were contributed by Fred Juhos, and one (\\"Life in July\\") was co-written by Miller and Nancy Becker. All three appeared on the B-side of the EP. As a result, the A-side label stated \\"All Songs by Scott Miller,\\" and the B-side label stated \\"All Songs by Fred Juhos, except as indicated.\\" Several years later, in the liner notes of the 1990 compilation Tinker to Evers to Chance, Miller wrote, \\"I'd forgotten what great bass and drum parts Fred Juhos and Dave Gill wrote and played\\" on \\"Penny, Things Won't.\\" Miller gave credit to Juhos for the title of the EP, and added, \\"if they are pointed accounts of someone you know, sue him.\\" Four of the songs were reissued on CD in 1993 by Alias Records as part of the compilation album Distortion of Glory. = 2014 reissue = In July 2014, Omnivore Recordings announced its commitment to reissue Game Theory's recordings, remastered from the original tapes by co-producer Dan Vallor, who was Game Theory's tour manager and sound engineer during the 1980s. The remastered version of Pointed Accounts of People You Know on 10-inch clear vinyl was released on November 28, 2014 in a limited pressing of 1,500 copies, available only in record stores, as part of Black Friday Record Store Day. On that same date, Omnivore reissued the Distortion EP on 10-inch green vinyl. The 2014 Pointed Accounts and Distortion EP releases included download cards. Earlier the same week, on November 24, Omnivore reissued the French compilation Dead Center as an omnibus release on CD, encompassing material from both EPs and additional tracks. At the request of Fred Juhos, the reissue of Dead Center omitted all songs written by Juhos, making them available exclusively on the EP releases and their associated digital downloads.  Critical response  = A-side = Trouser Press described the first side of Pointed Accounts as \\"light\\" and Miller's songs as \\"slightly off-kilter.\\" Lyrics such as \\"she likes metal and glass exact\\" were labeled \\"cryptic... but the hooks make them go down smoothly.\\" In a 1994 interview, Scott Miller similarly described the early Game Theory EPs as \\"spotty in quality,\\" and identified \\"Metal and Glass Exact\\" as one of the few songs he considered good, \\"sort of mid-tempo Elvis Costello.\\" AllMusic's Ned Raggett pointed to a contrast \\"between winning melody and slightly fragile edge\\" in \\"Penny, Things Won't\\" as exemplifying a \\"slightly moodier shade\\" than Davis-based contemporaries like Dream Syndicate and Thin White Rope. Raggett wrote: > Generally, the six songs on Pointed Accounts find Game Theory still in > general thrall to its '60s-inspired, '80s-recorded indie pop vision -- not > quite revivalist but avoiding mainstream temptations. \\"Selfish Again\\" makes > for a catchy little rocker, slowly growing in steady intensity and adding a > little bit of glazed VU/psych drone in the background... In the 2002 book All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul, reviewer Stewart Mason cited the \\"winsome\\" song \\"Penny, Things Won't,\\" and the \\"sneering rocker\\" \\"Metal and Glass Exact,\\" naming them as examples of \\"stellar material\\" that appeared on the Pointed Accounts EP. = B-side = According to Trouser Press, differences between the two sides of Pointed Accounts caused the EP to be \\"schizy\\". The song \\"Life in July,\\" co- written by Scott Miller and Nancy Becker, was \\"amiably quirky\\" according to AllMusic's Ned Raggett, with \\"pure herky-jerky new wave synth fun, a bubbling rush of fun that lives up to the title.\\" Becker's synth and vocals were also noted on the music blog Vinyl Exam, where a reviewer found the song (despite some \\"New Wave cliches\\") to be \\"catchy\\", citing its \\"cheesy 80s synthesizer sound, big drums, a bouncy beat\\" and Becker's vocals. The two songs contributed by Fred Juhos were omitted from the 1993 compilation album Distortion of Glory, to the regret of AllMusic's Stewart Mason: > The sarcastic fake-rap of \\"Kid Convenience\\" [from the Distortion EP] made > the cut, but neither of Juhos' other, much better, Game Theory offerings > did. Either the haunting \\"37th Day\\" or the bitter \\"I Wanna Get Hit by A Car\\" > (which was actually one of Game Theory's most popular early songs on college > radio) would have better commemorated Juhos' tenure in the band. In 1991, Trouser Press found Juhos' vision to be \\"further out\\" than Miller's, \\"darker and somewhat more intriguing, but he isn't Miller's equal as a tunesmith.\\" Twenty years later, Vinyl Exam wrote that the Juhos contribution \\"I Wanna Get Hit By a Car\\" was a \\"New Wave novelty song\\" that grew on the reviewer, blending The B-52's and Oingo Boingo influences. Juhos' \\"37th Day\\" was cited as \\"another departure ... a jangle pop ballad that evokes early Jefferson Airplane or Love without being explicitly retro.\\" Mike Appelstein, in the 2005 book Lost in the Grooves, summed up his view of Game Theory's first three releases with a comparison drawn from the two sides of Pointed Accounts: \\"Scott Miller had already proven himself capable of brilliant tunesmithing on the level of \\"Metal and Glass Exact\\" ... But this was the group responsible for \\"I Wanna Get Hit by a Car,\\" which was as pretentious as its title. On one album and two EPs, Game Theory soared toward the power pop heights, but sometimes settled for a thin, cheesy Casio rhythm. Through it all, they displayed a sense of ambition and high concept they weren't yet capable of reaching.  Later performances  Game Theory's 2013 reunion performance, a memorial tribute to Scott Miller, included an acoustic performance of \\"Penny, Things Won't,\\" with vocalist Alison Faith Levy accompanied by Fred Juhos on piano. \\"Selfish Again\\" was covered by Eric Matthews, known for bringing classical orchestral influences to indie pop music, and first released as a music video in January 2014. According to the release notes, the recording was \\"to be featured on an upcoming tribute to the songs of Scott Miller.\\" In an interview, Miller had named Matthews on a short list of artists he would have wanted to cover his songs.

This contact binary was discovered on 23 February 2006, by astronomers of the LINEAR program at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. On 10 February 2014, it passed 6.25 lunar distances from Earth. The asteroid is approximately 400 meters in diameter and has a rotation period of 5.77 hours.  Classification and orbit  ' is a member of the Apollo group, which are Earth-crossing asteroids and the largest group of near-Earth asteroids. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.3–2.4 AU once every 19 months (583 days; semi-major axis of 1.37 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.78 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the body's observation arc begins with its discovery observation in 2006. = Close approaches = The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of , which corresponds to 6.4 lunar distances (LD). On 10 February 2014, it passed Earth close to this theoretical minimum distance at 6.25 LD, or . This makes is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), a body with a threatening close approach to the Earth, due to its low MOID and large size (absolute magnitude of 18.9). PHAs are defined as objects with an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter – which generically corresponds to a diameter of approximately 140 meters – and a MOID that is smaller than 0.05 AU or 19.5 LD.  Physical characteristics  ' is an assumed stony S-type asteroid. This asteroid is a typical contact binary, with two distinctive lobes on either end that appear to be in contact, giving it a peanut-like shape. = Diameter, shape and albedo = On the night of 11 February 2014, NASA scientists conducted a radar imaging session using the 70-meter dish at Goldstone Observatory. These observations, using delay- Doppler radar imaging, revealed a 400 × 200 meters sized body, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link calculates a diameter of almost 500 meters, based on an assumed standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and an absolute magnitude of 18.9. Amateur and professional astronomers helped track ' in the preceding days, so they would know just where to point the large antenna. = Rotation period = Goldstone's radiometric observations also gave a rotation period of approximately 6 hours. Photometric follow-up observations led to two light-curves that gave a refined period of 5.77 and 5.78 hours with a high brightness variation of 1.05 and 0.9, respectively (). Its high brightness amplitude is also indicative for its elongated shape.  Naming  As of 2018, this minor planet remains unnamed.

He is believed to have been a triple agent by some, underscoring the RCMP's inexperience in espionage. Due to power struggles between the Canadian and British intelligence agencies during the Second World War and the RCMP's inexperience, Operation Watchdog was a failure. Janowski provided little significant intelligence to the Allies: no Abwehr agents were arrested and no U-boats were captured, despite his apparent cooperation. Within a year the operation was shut down and Janowski was sent to a prison in Britain. Espionage career Janowski disembarked from the submarine at Chaleur Bay, four miles west of New Carlisle, Quebec, around 5 a.m., on November 9, 1942. His destination was Montreal, having first to stop in New Carlisle so he could take the first train out. At 6:30 a.m., under the alias of William Brenton, Janowski checked in at Hotel New Carlisle asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel owner, Earle Annett Jr., grew suspicious of him, due to inconsistencies with the German spy's story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also noticed that he spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and made his way to the train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train. Annett followed him to the station, sat down beside him, and offered some cigarettes. Von Janowski lit the cigarette using the same Belgian matches he had at the hotel. Annett grew even more suspicious and alerted Constable Alfonse Duchesneau of the Quebec Provincial Police, who boarded the train car just as it was leaving the station. Duchesneau intercepted Janowski, who maintained he was William Brenton, a radio salesman from Toronto. He stuck with this story until the policeman asked to search his bags; Janowski immediately said to Duchesneau, \\"Searching my luggage won't be necessary. I am a German officer who serves his country as you serve yours.\\" Inspection of von Janowski's personal effects upon his arrest revealed that he was carrying a powerful radio transmitter, among other things. After his capture and interrogation, the Canadian military attempted to locate the German submarine in which Janowski had arrived. Despite an extensive search of Chaleur Bay, both the warship HMCS Burlington and assisting Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft were unable to locate U-518. In late August 1943, Janowski was sent to England, where he was incarcerated at Camp 020. He remained there for the duration of the war. He was repatriated to an internment camp in the British Zone of Germany in July 1945. Later life Released in 1947, Janowski had no home to return to, as Allenstein and most of East Prussia had been annexed by Poland and its population expelled. He eventually found work as a translator, and in the 1960s worked for the German Navy. Janowski died in Spain in 1978 while on a holiday.

The house features approximately 3,000 square feet of exterior porches with decorative spindlework and carved brackets. The property also includes an ice house, a spring house, and a chicken coop / pony stall. Cotton fields surround the house and are still cultivated today. Thomas Haigler inherited 910 acres of land from his father in the later part of the 19th century and then purchased 305 additional acres. He built the home on this property and lived there with his first wife, Frances, and their seven children. When Frances died in 1913, he remarried and had another four children with his second wife, Agnes. They raised all 11 children in the house. In the 1920s, Haigler had financial troubles and he mortgaged off parcels of the land. By 1927, all of the property was auctioned off and purchased by the Bank of Cameron.

The two groups have minimal differences but the Young Muslim Organisation has a more conservative interpretation of sharia and Islamic jurisprudence. According to a former activist, Ed Husain, YMO was founded by supporters of Abul A'la Maududi and Hassan al-Banna, and members are encouraged to follow their works. Husain describes the organisation as being structured in a hierarchy with ordinary members at the bottom, followed by pillar members, and the National Executive Committee of the YMO at the top. Ordinary members become pillar after years of activities and proving one's loyalty when they take a vow and swearing allegiance to the leadership. At least when Husain was a member in the early 1990s, East London Mosque was a YMO stronghold from which the organisation was working to spread.

He is currently professor at National University of Quilmes and researcher at CONICET. He is author of several books about biology and related topics, although he is mainly known due to his appearances on radio and television. Life He graduated from University of Buenos Aires in 1988 with a magna cum laude degree. Four years later, he obtained a PhD in biology at the same institution. In parallel with his biology career and still in his young years Golombek started to write short stories and poetry. He was awarded several literary prizes in Argentina, Chile and Venezuela. Work Golombek is an experienced researcher in chronobiology. In 2007 he received the Ig Nobel Prize for discovering that hamsters recover from jetlag more quickly under the effects of Viagra. He is known for his aim of making biology understandable for laymen; his efforts are mostly intended to make public some aspects of scientists' everyday life, which are usually considered to be hidden or enigmatic. He insists that science is a fundamental resource for increasing the socio-economic activity of an underdeveloped country like Argentina. He has taken part in Científicos Industria Argentina (English: Scientists Made in Argentina), a TV show hosted by mathematician Adrián Paenza and broadcast by TV Pública. Golombek also hosts his own show in the same channel, which is named Doctor G. It is a children-oriented show, in which he—along with his assistants, Sir from Here and Sir from There—explains the science behind everyday tasks, such as what are the chemical procedures involved in cooking an asado or how a match works. Moreover, he is editor-in- chief of a collection called \\"Ciencia que ladra...\\", printed by Siglo Veintiuno. Its name is a mention to the Spanish version of the proverb \\"its bark is worse than its bite\\", but in reference to science. Politics In 2016 Golombek became part of a Macri administration think tank which purported to be a \\"Presidential Council,\\" but he left immediately after the first meeting. In the wake of 2018 abortion debate in Argentina, he endorsed its legalization arguing that \\"a group of living cells do not represent a human being\\".

It emerged in the tenth century and continued until it ceased to function when James VI inherited the throne of England in 1603. For most of the medieval era, the king had no \\"capital\\" as such. The Pictish centre of Forteviot was the chief royal seat of the early Gaelic Kingdom of Alba that became the Kingdom of Scotland. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries Scone was a centre for royal business. Edinburgh only began to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III but his successors undertook occasional royal progress to a part of the kingdom. Little is known about the structure of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I when it began to take on a distinctly feudal character, with the major offices of the Steward, Chamberlain, Constable, Marischal and Lord Chancellor. By the early modern era the court consisted of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. The Chancellor was now effectively the first minister of the kingdom and from the mid- sixteenth century he was the leading figure of the Privy Council. At least from the accession of David I Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French. In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, became the dominant language. Ideas of chivalry began to dominate during the reign of David II. Tournaments provided one focus of display. The Scottish crown in the fifteenth century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life. By the sixteenth century, the court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. There were probably filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king. After the \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over their functions, accompanying their poetry on the harp. James I may have taken English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court after his captivity and Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court. James VI became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band. From the fifteenth century the records of the Scottish court contain references to artists. The most impressive works and artists were imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands. James VI employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst and Adrian Vanson, who have left a visual record of the king and major figures at the court. In the early Middle Ages Forteviot probably served as a royal palace. The introduction of feudalism into Scotland in the twelfth century led to the introduction of royal castles. Under the Stuart Dynasty there was a programme of extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces. Lavish spending on luxurious clothing, fine foods, the patronage of innovative architecture, art and music can be seen from the reign of James I. His successors struggled with different levels of success with the costs of the royal court. After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue. Location The seal of Walter Fitzalan (1106–77), the first hereditary Royal Stewart For most of the medieval era, the king was itinerant and had no \\"capital\\" as such. The Pictish centre of Forteviot was the chief royal seat of the early Gaelic Kingdom of Alba that became the Kingdom of Scotland. It was used by Cinaed mac Ailpin (Kenneth MacAlpin, r. 843–58) and his brother Domnall mac Ailpín (Donald I MacAlpin, 812–62). Later poetic tradition suggests that Máel Coluim mac Donnchada (Malcolm III \\"Canmore\\", r. 1058–93) was also resident and charters of Malcolm IV (dated 1162–64) and of William I (dated 1165–71) indicate that it remained important into the twelfth century. After this it fell from the royal circuit, but it remained a royal estate until the fourteenth century.S. T. Driscoll, Alba: The Gaelic Kingdom of Scotland, AD 800–1124, The Making of Scotland (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2002), p. 13. David I (r. 1124–53) tried to build up Roxburgh as a royal centre,J. Bannerman, \\"MacDuff of Fife,\\" in A. Grant & K. Stringer, eds., Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1993), pp. 22–3. but in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, more charters were issued at Scone than any other location, suggesting that this was a centre for royal business. Other popular locations in the early part of the era were nearby Perth, Stirling, Dunfermline and Edinburgh.P. G. B. McNeill and Hector L. MacQueen, eds, Atlas of Scottish History to 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), pp. 159–63. The court was severely disrupted during the Wars of Independence (1296–1357) and almost ceased to function, but was restored by Robert I and his Stuart successors, who attempted to embody national and dynastic identity. In the later Middle Ages the king moved between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but continued to hold judicial sessions throughout the kingdom. Edinburgh only began to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III (r. 1460–88) at the cost of considerable unpopularity, as it was felt that the king's presence in the rest of the kingdom was part of his role.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 14–15. Although increasingly based at the royal palace of Holyrood in Edinburgh, the monarch and the court still spent time at the refurbished royal palaces of Linlithgow, Stirling and Falkland, and still undertook occasional royal progress to different parts of the kingdom to ensure that the rule of law, royal authority or smooth government was maintained.J. Goodare, The Government of Scotland, 1560–1625 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , p. 141. Composition =Offices= Great Seal of Mary Queen of Scots (1542–67) Little is known about the structure of the Scottish royal court in the period before the reign of David I. Some minor posts that are mentioned in later sources are probably Gaelic in origin. These include the senior clerks of the Provend and the Liverence, in charge of the distribution of food, and the Hostarius (later Usher or \\"Doorward\\"), who was in charge of the royal bodyguard.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), pp. 11–12. By the late thirteenth century the court had taken on a distinctly feudal character. The major offices were the Steward or Stewart, Chamberlain, Constable, Marischal and Lord Chancellor. The office of Stewart, responsible for management of the king's household, was created by David I and given as an hereditary office to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. The office was merged with the crown when Robert II inherited the throne. The other major secular posts also had a tendency to become hereditary. The Chamberlain was responsible for royal finances and the Constable for organising the crown's military forces, while the Marishchal had a leadership role in battle. The Chancellor, who was usually a clergyman in the Middle Ages, had charge of the king's chapel, which was also the major administrative centre of the crown, and had control of the letters, legal writs and seals. Under him were various posts, usually filled by clerics, including the custodian of the great seal. From the reign of James III onwards, the post of Chancellor was increasingly taken by leading laymen. By the early modern era the court consisted of leading nobles, office holders, ambassadors and supplicants who surrounded the king or queen. At its centre was the monarch and members of the Privy Chamber. Gentleman of the chamber were usually leading nobles or individuals with kinship links to the leading noble families. They had direct access to the monarch, with the implication of being able to exert influence, and were usually resident at the court.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, pp. 88–9. The Chancellor was now effectively the first minister of the kingdom and from the mid-sixteenth century he was the leading figure of the Privy Council. His department, the chancery, was responsible for the Great Seal, which was needed to process the inheritance of land titles and the confirmation of land transfers. His key responsibility was to preside at meetings of the Privy Council, and, on those rare occasions he attended, at meetings of the court of session.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, pp. 150–1. The second most prestigious office was now the Secretary, who was responsible for the records of the Privy Council and for foreign policy, including the borders, despite which the post retained its importance after the Union of Crowns in 1603. The Treasurer was the last of the major posts and, with the Comptroller, dealt with the royal finances until the Comptroller's office was merged into the Treasurer's from 1610.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, p. 152. The Lord President of the Court of Session, often known simply as the Lord President, acted as a link between the Privy Council and the Court.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, p. 160. The king's advocate acted as the legal council. The post emerged in the 1490s to deal with the king's patrimonial land rights and from 1555 there were usually two king's councillors, indicating the increase in the level of work. From 1579 they increasingly became a public prosecutor.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, p. 164. After the union most of the offices remained, but political power was increasingly centred in London.Mackie, Lenman and Parker, A History of Scotland, pp. 282–4. =General council= Detail from the so-called 'Hertford sketch' of Edinburgh in 1544, showing Holyrood Palace, described as 'the kyng of Skotts palas' and the main site for council meetings After the crown, the most important government institution in the late Middle Ages was the king's council, composed of the king's closest advisers and presided over by the Lord Chancellor. Unlike its counterpart in England, the king's council in Scotland retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, some of whom were nominated by parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 22–3. The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late fifteenth century, and surviving records from the period indicate that it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the late Medieval Period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy. The most successful of these moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, towards the end of the period, archbishops. By the end of the fifteenth century, this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. =Privy Council= The Privy Council developed out of the theoretically larger king's or queen's council of leading nobles and office holders in the sixteenth century. \\"Secret Councils\\" had been maintained during the many regencies of the later medieval era, but the origins of the Privy Council were in 1543, during the minority of Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542–67). After her majority it was not disbanded, but continued to sit and became an accepted part of government.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, pp. 35 and 130. While in session in Edinburgh, the Privy Council met in what is now the West Drawing Room at the Palace of Holyroodhouse.M. Glendinning, A. MacKechnie and R. D. Oram, The Architecture of Scottish Government: from Kingship to Parliamentary Democracy (Dundee: Dundee University Press, 2004), , p. 144. When the monarch was at one of the royal palaces or visiting a region of the kingdom on official business, the council would normally go with them and as a result of being away from its servants, records and members, its output tended to decrease. While the monarch was away on a holiday or hunting trip, the council usually stayed in session in Edinburgh and continued to run the government. The Privy Council's primary function was judicial, but it also acted as a body of advisers to the monarch and as a result its secondary function was as an executive in the absence or minority of the monarch.F. N. McCoy, Robert Baillie and the Second Scots Reformation (Berkeley CA: University of California Press, 1974), , pp. 1–2. Although the monarch might often attend the council, their presence was not necessary for the council to act with royal authority.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, p. 140. Like parliament, it had the power to issue acts that could have the force of law.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 15. Although the theoretical membership of the council was relatively large, at around 30 persons, most of the business was carried out by an informal inner group, consisting mainly of the officers of state.Goodare, The Government of Scotland, p. 135. Culture =Language= David I, credited with changing the culture of the court from Gaelic to Norman, with his successor Malcolm IV who allegedly described himself as French The union of the Gaelic and Pictish kingdoms that created the kingdom of Alba in the eighth century led to a domination by Gaelic language and culture.Driscoll, Alba: The Gaelic Kingdom of Scotland, p. 33. At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124–53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French.K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. So complete was this cultural transformation that David's successors Malcolm IV and William I, according to the English Barnwell Chronicle, confessed themselves to be French in \\"both in race and in manners, in language and culture\\".C. Eddington, \\"Royal Court: 1 to 1542\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 535–7. However, Gaelic culture remained part of the court throughout the Middle Ages, with Gaelic musicians and poets still being patronised by James IV (1488–1513), who was a Gaelic speaker.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books : A History of Scottish Literature: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), , p. 104. In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from the Gaelic, French & Scandinavian languages. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct language from the late fourteenth century onwards.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 60–7. As the ruling elite gradually abandoned French, they began to adopt Middle Scots, and by the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I (r. 1406–37) onwards and of the court soon after.M. Jones and I. Singh, Exploring Language Change (London: Routledge, 2013), , p. 71. =Display= The four European orders of chivalry to which James V belonged on the entrance to Linlithgow Palace: the orders of the Garter, the Thistle, the Golden Fleece and St. Michael Ideas of chivalry, similar to those that developed at the English court of Edward III, began to dominate in Scotland during the reign of the Anglophile David II (1329–71). Tournaments provided one focus of display. These occurred in 1449 at Stirling Castle in the reign of James II (r. 1437–60), where the Burgundian adventurer Jacques de Lalaing fought the greatest Scottish knights. In the early sixteenth century chivalry was evolving from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult. It saw its origins in the classical era, with Hector of Troy, Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar often depicted as proto-knights. Tournaments of the Wild Knight in 1507 and the Black Lady in 1508 were held under James IV. They were also pursued enthusiastically by James V (r. 1513–42) who, proud of his membership of international orders of knighthood, displayed their insignia on the Gateway at Linlithgow Palace. Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish crown in the fifteenth century adopted the example of the Burgundian court, through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 18. By the sixteenth century, the court was central to the patronage and dissemination of Renaissance works and ideas. It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy. During her brief personal rule Mary, Queen of Scots brought many of the elaborate court activities that she had grown up with at the French court, with balls, masques and celebrations, designed to illustrate the resurgence of the monarchy and to facilitate national unity.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, eds, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 192–3. There were elaborate staged events at the investiture of Mary's husband Darnley in at Candlemass in February 1566. In December of the same year there was an elaborate three-day festival to celebrate the baptism of her son and heir, the future James VI, copied from the festivities at Bayonne a year before by Charles IX of France. It included a ritual assault on a fort by mock \\"wild highlanders\\", symbolising the role of the dynasty in defending the nation. Under James VI the court returned to being a centre of culture and learning and he cultivated the image of a philosopher king, evoking the models of David, Solomon and Constantine.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", p. 200. =Music= The interior of the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle, a major focus for liturgical court music Early Medieval Scotland and Ireland shared a common culture and language. There are much fuller historical sources for Ireland, which suggest that there would have been filidh in Scotland, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in the Gaelic to the next generation.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), .R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. After the \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh, often trained in bardic schools.K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. They probably accompanied their poetry on the harp.W. McLeod, Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland, C.1200-c.1650 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , p. 102. When Alexander III (r. 1249–86) met Edward I in England he was accompanied by a Master Elyas, described as \\"the king of Scotland's harper\\".K. Sanger and A. Kinnaird, Tree of Strings (Kinmor Music, 1992), , p. 78. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8–12. The story of the execution of James III's favourites, including the English musician William Roger, at Lauder Bridge in 1482, may indicate his interest in music. Renaissance monarchs often used chapels to impress visiting dignitaries. James III also founded a new large hexagonal Chapel Royal at Restalrig near Holyrood, that was probably designed for a large number of choristers.J. R. Baxter, \\"Music, ecclesiastical\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 431–2. In 1501 his son James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir meant to emulate St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald, A. J. Vanderjagt and A. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450–1650 (Brill, 2003), , p. 163. No piece of music can be unequivocally identified with these chapels, but the survival of a Mass based on the Burgundian song L'Homme armé in the later Carver Choirbook may indicate that this was part of the Chapel Royal repertoire. James IV was said to be constantly accompanied by music, but very little surviving secular music can be unequivocally attributed to his court. An entry in the accounts of the Lord Treasurer of Scotland indicates that when James IV was at Stirling on 17 April 1497, there was a payment \\"to twa fithalaris [fiddlers] that sang Greysteil to the king, ixs\\". Greysteil was an epic romance and the music survives, having been placed in a collection of lute airs in the seventeenth century.R. Chambers, Chambers Book of Days (The Book of Days: A Miscellany of Popular Antiquities in Connection with the Calendar, Including Anecdote, Biography, & History, Curiosities of Literature and Oddities of Human Life and Character) (W. and R. Chambers, London and Edinburgh, 1864). Scotland followed the trend of Renaissance courts for instrumental accompaniment and playing. James V, as well as being a major patron of sacred music, was a talented lute player and introduced French chansons and consorts of viols to his court, although almost nothing of this secular chamber music survives.J. Patrick, Renaissance and Reformation (London: Marshall Cavendish, 2007), , p. 1264. The return of Mary, Queen of Scots from France in 1561 to begin her personal reign, and her position as a Catholic, gave a new lease of life to the choir of the Chapel Royal, but the destruction of Scottish church organs meant that instrumentation to accompany the mass had to employ bands of musicians with trumpets, drums, fifes, bagpipes and tabors. Like her father she played the lute, virginals and (unlike her father) was a fine singer.A. Fraser, Mary Queen of Scots (London: Book Club Associates, 1969), pp. 206–7. She brought French musical influences with her, employing lutenists and viol players in her household.M. Spring, The Lute in Britain: A History of the Instrument and Its Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 452. James VI (r. 1566–1625) was a major patron of the arts in general. He rebuilt the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1594 and the choir was used for state occasions like the baptism of his son Henry.P. Le Huray, Music and the Reformation in England, 1549–1660 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978), , pp. 83–5. He followed the tradition of employing lutenists like John Norlie for his private entertainment, as did other members of his family.T. Carter and J. Butt, The Cambridge History of Seventeenth- Century Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , pp. 280, 300, 433 and 541. =Literature= The seal of Gavin Douglas as Bishop of Dunkeld The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion until the end of the war of independence.A. A. M. Duncan, ed., The Brus (Canongate, 1997), , p. 3. The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy, and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England.N. Jayapalan, History of English Literature (Atlantic, 2001), , p. 23. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I, who wrote the extended poem The Kingis Quair. James IV's (r. 1488–1513) creation of a Renaissance court included the patronage of poets who were mainly clerics. These included Robert Henryson (c. 1450-c. 1505), who re- worked Medieval and Classical sources, such as Chaucer and Aesop in works such as his Testament of Cresseid and The Morall Fabillis. William Dunbar (1460–1513) produced satires, lyrics, invectives and dream visions that established the vernacular as a flexible medium for poetry of any kind. Gavin Douglas (1475–1522), who became Bishop of Dunkeld, injected Humanist concerns and classical sources into his poetry.T. van Heijnsbergen, \\"Culture: 9 Renaissance and Reformation: poetry to 1603\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 129–30. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados. It was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden that brought the reign to an end. As a patron of poets and authors James V supported William Stewart and John Bellenden, who translated the Latin History of Scotland compiled in 1527 by Hector Boece, into verse and prose.I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 256–7. David Lyndsay (c. 1486–1555), diplomat and the head of the Lyon Court, was a prolific poet. He wrote elegiac narratives, romances and satires. George Buchanan (1506–82) had a major influence as a Latin poet, founding a tradition of neo-Latin poetry that would continue in to the seventeenth century.R. Mason, \\"Culture: 4 Renaissance and Reformation (1460–1660): general\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 120–3. Contributors to this tradition included royal secretary John Maitland (1537–95), reformer Andrew Melville (1545–1622), John Johnston (1570?–1611) and David Hume of Godscroft (1558–1629).\\"Bridging the Continental divide: neo-Latin and its cultural role in Jacobean Scotland, as seen in the Delitiae Poetarum Scotorum (1637)\\", University of Glasgow, retrieved 23 July 2013. From the 1550s, in the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots and the minority of her son James VI (r. 1567–1625), cultural pursuits were limited by the lack of a royal court and by political turmoil. The Kirk, heavily influenced by Calvinism, also discouraged poetry that was not devotional in nature. Nevertheless, poets from this period included courtier and minister Alexander Hume (c. 1556–1609), whose corpus of work includes nature poetry and epistolary verse. Alexander Scott's (?1520-82/3) use of short verse designed to be sung to music, opened the way for the Castalian poets of James VI's adult reign. In the 1580s and 1590s James VI strongly promoted the literature of the country of his birth in Scots. His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition in his mother tongue, to which he applied Renaissance principles.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 126–7. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, later called the Castalian Band, which included William Fowler (c. 1560–1612), John Stewart of Baldynneis (c. 1545–c. 1605), and Alexander Montgomerie (c. 1550–98).R. D. S. Jack, Alexander Montgomerie (Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press, 1985), , pp. 1–2. They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and Robert Ayton (1570–1627). By the late 1590s the king's championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne.R. D. S. Jack, \\"Poetry under King James VI\\", p. 137. =Art= Painting of Regent Morton, one of the portraits of leading figures of the late sixteenth-century court by Flemish artist Arnold Bronckorst From the fifteenth century the records of the Scottish court contain references to artists. Matthew the \\"king's painter\\" is the first mentioned, said to be at Linlithgow in 1434.M. R. Apted and S. Hannabuss, eds, Painters in Scotland, 1301–1700: a Biographical Dictionary (Scottish Record Society, 1978), p. 119. The most impressive works and artists were imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, and the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named. There are also a relatively large number of elaborate devotional books from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, usually produced in the Low Countries and France for Scottish patrons, including the Flemish illustrated book of hours, known as the Hours of James IV of Scotland, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor and described as \\"perhaps the finest medieval manuscript to have been commissioned for Scottish use\\".D. H. Caldwell, ed., Angels, Nobles and Unicorns: Art and Patronage in Medieval Scotland (Edinburgh: National Museum of Scotland, 1982), p. 84. Around 1500, about the same time as in England, Scottish monarchs turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits, painted in oils on wood, perhaps as a form of political expression. In 1502 James IV paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household, probably by the \\"Inglishe payntour\\" named \\"Mynours,\\" who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride Margaret Tudor the following year.R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , p. 449. \\"Mynours\\" was Maynard Wewyck, a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London.M. Belozerskaya, Rethinking the Renaissance, Burgundian Arts Across Europe (Cambridge 2002), , p. 159: J. W. Clark, 'Notes on the tomb of Margaret Beaufort,' Proceedings Cambridge Antiquarian Society, 45 (1883), pp. 267–8. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions, but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 57–9. The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century. In his majority James V was probably more concerned with architectural expressions of royal identity.R. Tittler, \\"Portrait, politics and society\\", in R. Tittler and N. Jones, eds, A Companion to Tudor Britain (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , pp. 455–6. Mary Queen of Scots had been brought up in the French court, where she was drawn and painted by major European artists, but she did not commission any adult portraits, with the exception of the joint portrait with her second husband Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. This may have reflected an historic Scottish pattern, where heraldic display or an elaborate tomb were considered more important than a portrait. There was an attempt to produce a series of portraits of Scottish kings in panel portraits, probably for the royal entry of the fifteen-year-old James VI in 1579, which are Medieval in form. In James VI's personal reign, Renaissance forms of portraiture began to dominate. He employed two Flemish artists, Arnold Bronckorst in the early 1580s and Adrian Vanson from around 1584 to 1602, who have left a visual record of the king and major figures at the court.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 55–6. =Architecture= Linlithgow Palace, the first building to bear the title \\"palace\\" in Scotland, extensively rebuilt along Renaissance principles from the fifteenth century The royal centre at Forteviot was not in a defensive situation and there are no traces of any fortified enclosure. There is some archaeological evidence of artistic and architectural patronage on an impressive scale. The most notable piece of sculpture is the Dupplin Cross, found nearby and perhaps once part of the complex, but there are other fragments including the unique Forteviot Arch. Aerial photographs show that Forteviot was also the site of a major cemetery.Driscoll, Alba: The Gaelic Kingdom of Scotland, pp. 33–5. The introduction of feudalism into Scotland in the twelfth century led to the creation of baronial castles. There were also royal castles, often larger and providing defence, lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre. By 1200 these included fortifications at Ayr and Berwick.C. J. Tabraham, Scotland's Castles (London: Batsford, 2005), , p. 12. Alexander II (r. 1198–1249) and Alexander III (r. 1249–86) undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style, but this phase of royal castle building came to an end with the early death of Alexander III that ushered in the Wars of Independence.S. Reid, Castles and Tower Houses of the Scottish Clans, 1450–1650 (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , p. 12.G. Stell, \\"War- damaged Castles: the evidence from Medieval Scotland,\\" in Chateau Gaillard: Actes du colloque international de Graz (Autriche) (Caen, France: Publications du CRAHM, 2000), , p. 278. Under the Stuart Dynasty there was a programme of extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces. This probably began under James III, accelerated under James IV and reached its peak under James V. The influence of Renaissance architecture is reflected in these buildings. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I (r. 1406–27), under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace from 1429, apparently the first use of this term in the country. It was extended under James III and resembled a quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace or palatium ad moden castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery. There is evidence that Italian masons were employed by James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 9. In 1536 James V visited France for his marriage to Madeleine of Valois and would have come in contact with French Renaissance architecture. His second marriage to Mary of Guise two years later may have resulted in longer-term connections and influences.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", p. 195. One multi-talented French wood-carver, furniture-maker, and metal-worker, Andrew Mansioun settled in Edinburgh and trained apprentices.Pearce, M., 'A French Furniture Maker and the 'Courtly Style' in Sixteenth-Century Scotland', Regional Furniture, 32 (2018), pp. 127-136. Scottish architecture largely disregarded the insular style of England under Henry VIII and adopted forms that were recognisably European.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 5. Rather than slavishly copying continental forms, elements of these styles were integrated into traditional local patterns,Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", p. 189. and adapted to Scottish idioms and materials (particularly stone and harl).D. M. Palliser, The Cambridge Urban History of Britain: 600–1540, vol. 1 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 391–2. The building at Linlithgow was followed by rebuilding at Holyrood Palace, Falkland Palace, Stirling Castle and Edinburgh Castle, described by Roger Mason as \\"some of the finest examples of Renaissance architecture in Britain\\".R. Mason, \\"Renaissance and Reformation: the sixteenth century\\", in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 102. Many of the building programs were planned and financed by James Hamilton of Finnart, Steward of the Royal Household and Master of Works to James V.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, p. 120. From the mid-sixteenth century royal architectural work was much more limited. There were minor works were undertaken at Edinburgh Castle after the siege of 1575 and a viewing platform was added to Stirling Castle in the 1580s.M. Lynch, \\"Royal Court: 2 1542–1603\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 535–7. Work undertaken for James VI by William Schaw demonstrated continued Renaissance influences in the classical entrance of the Chapel Royal at Stirling, built in 1594.Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", pp. 201–2. Finance The ruins of Holyrood Abbey, which was briefly rebuilt to provide a chapel for the small court of the future James VII Lavish spending on luxurious clothing, fine foods, the patronage of innovative architecture, art and music can be seen from the reign of James I. James III is generally thought to have amassed a surplus and, despite his lavish spending, James IV was able to sustain his finances, probably thanks mainly to an increase in revenues from crown lands, the latter doubling his income from this source across his reign.E. Gemmill and N. Mayhew, Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: A Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , p. 375. James V was able to undertake lavish court spending due to two dowries from the King of France and his ability to exploit the wealth of the church, despite which spending kept pace with expanding income.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 138–9. Mary, Queen of Scots' attempt to create a court in the image the French Renaissance monarchy was hampered by financial limitations, intensified by the general price inflation of the period.A. Fraser, Mary Queen Of Scots. The court of James VI proved extremely expensive and may have provided one of the motivations for the attempted coup of the Ruthven Raid of 1582. After his marriage to Anne of Denmark in 1589–90 spending in the court spiraled further out of control. Costume for the king and queen and favoured household servants came from an English subsidy gifted by Queen Elizabeth and managed by the goldsmith Thomas Foulis.Jemma Field, 'Dressing a Queen: The Wardrobe of Anna of Denmark at the Scottish Court of King James VI, 1590–1603', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019), pp. 153-5. Despite the money from England, by the closing months of 1591 the rising costs of both households prompted estimates and suggestions for cutting costs on food and costume, and increasing revenue from royal assets.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 140.. The last of the queen's dowry, 54,000 Danish dalers, which had been loaned to several Scottish towns was spent on the elaborate court entertainment and masque for the baptism of Prince of Wales in August 1594.Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), pp. 116, 131-2, 151-4: Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 54. A group of courtiers known as the Octavians emerged after making economies in the queen's household. They were given control of the exchequer but angered established nobles who were the main beneficiaries of royal favour and were dismissed in 1598. Dissolution After James VI inherited the English throne in 1603 the Scottish court effectively ceased to exist, ending its role as a centre of artistic patronage, political display and intrigue.Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603–1745, p. 12. A number of Scottish poets, including William Alexander, John Murray and Robert Aytoun accompanied the king to London, where they continued to write,K. M. Brown, \\"Scottish identity\\", in B. Bradshaw and P. Roberts, eds, British Consciousness and Identity: The Making of Britain, 1533–1707 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , pp. 253–3. but they soon began to anglicise their written language.M. Spiller, \\"Poetry after the Union 1603–1660\\" in C. Cairns, ed., The History of Scottish Literature (Aberdeen University Press, 1988), vol. 1, , pp. 141–52. The Chapel Royal now began to fall into disrepair, and the court in Westminster would be the only major source of royal music. The result has been seen as a shift \\"from crown to castle\\", as the nobility and local lairds became the major sources of artistic patronage.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 193. The Privy Council functioned as a subservient executive carrying out instructions from London. Holyrood Abbey was remodelled as a chapel for Charles I's royal visit in 1633. and Holyrood would be reclaimed by Charles II after the Restoration. As commissioner the future James VII's took up residency in the early 1680s, running what was in effect a small court. However, it was sacked by an anti-papist mob during the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and would never be repaired.D. J. Smith, \\"Keyboard music in Scotland: genre, gender, context\\", in J.

In multi-slide and sound pieces including Love After Death (1986), Cypis overlaid emotionally and psychologically loaded imagery—erotic photographs, borrowings from media, medicine, religion and Renaissance painting, haunting family snapshots, exotic travel slides—to create phantasmagoric installations that engulfed performers and spectators in a fluctuating tableau of audio and visual stimuli.Riddle, Mason. \\"Dorit Cypis,\\" Artforum, March 1987, p. 135–6.

Her installation X-Rayed (1988, Whitney Museum) incorporated sound, performance and more than 300 images—one-third depicting a naked woman exploring her body through looking at book images and at herself. Challenging stereotypes, it explored both empowerment—whether a woman can possess her body while being looked at—and thorny, socially conditioned feelings of shame, guilt and repulsion; such feelings extended to the work's subject, who reacted publicly and threatened litigation to block its future presentation. A year later, Cypis produced X-Rayed, (altered), replicating the original images by substituting her own naked body for the model's. Artweek's Tony Reveaux described its choreography of imagery and gazes (of Cypis, the camera, and viewer) as \\"a beguiling and unnerving walk-through cubist self- portrait of sexual recognition and identity.\\" In subsequent exhibitions, Cypis broadened her examinations of identity, drawing comparisons to Carolee Schneemann and Cindy Sherman.Randolph, Karen M. \\"Dorit Cypis,\\" New Art Examiner, January 1995, p. 60–1.

Background The song's theme is a positive interpretation of the German national identity re-awakening in a positive and tolerant way, thus allowing young Germans to identify with their country: \\"Fragt man mich jetzt, woher ich komme, / Tu ich mir nicht mehr selber leid\\" (If I am asked now where I'm from, / I no longer pity myself).Kruse, Merle-Marie.

Its main purpose was as a walking stick, but it had a number of other uses in emergency situations and can be used for Scout pioneering. History Canadian Boy Scouts on parade with their staves at Calgary in 1915. When Robert Baden- Powell devised his scheme of Scout citizenship training for boys, published in 1908 in Scouting for Boys, he recommended that Scouts should carry \\"a strong stick, about as high as your nose, marked in feet and inches for measuring\\". After listing the various uses to which the staff could be put, he added \\"If you get the chance, cut your own staff, but remember to get permission first\\". It was said to have been based on a staff used by a Royal Engineers officer during the Fourth Anglo-Ashanti War. In August 1917, Baden-Powell wrote a critical article in the Headquarters Gazette about \\"the matter of Scouts being allowed to parade without their staffs, which for several reasons is regrettable\\". In the same article, he lists the cultural roots of the Scout staff which he claimed were \\"the scouts of Cuhulain armed with staffs, the pilgrims... with their cockle-shells and staffs, the 'prentice bands of London with their cloth yards and their staffs, the merry men of Robin Hood with bows and quarter staffs, down to the present-day mountaineers, war-scouts, and explorers\\". At the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929, French Scouts constructed an replica of the Eiffel Tower constructed entirely of lashed Scout staves.Tenderfoot to Queen's Scout, The Canadian Boy Scouts' Association, 1955 (p. 24) In the United Kingdom, the cost and awkwardness of the staff meant that it became common for Scout Troops to hold a stock of staves in their meeting place, rather than have Scouts carry them about. The final blow came with the 1966 Advance Party Report, which recommended that \\"With the exception of a knife, no present optional items of uniform (e.g. staff, thumbstick, haversack.... ) may in future be worn\\".The Boy Scouts' Association (1966), The Chief Scout's Advance Party Report (p. 78) Description The official Policy, Organization and Rules of the Boy Scouts Association (UK) stipulated that the staff must be \\"Marked in feet and inches, in length\\".Policy, Organization and Rules for Canada, The Boy Scouts' Association, The Canadian General Council, 1919 (p. 13) Patrol Leaders carried a white pennant on their staves, showing a silhouette of their Patrol animal (each Patrol was named after an animal or bird). Modern commercially produced Scout staves are still available in the United Kingdom, generally made from coppice grown ash. Baden- Powell's drawing of a Patrol Leader's pennant: \\"Each patrol leader has a small white flag on his staff with the head of his patrol animal shown in red cloth stitched on to it on both sides. Thus the 'Wolves' of the 1st London Troop would have the flag shown below\\". Uses Some uses of he Scout staff that have been recommended by various Scouting publications: * Making an improvised stretcher * Holding back a crowd * Jumping over a ditch (pole vault) * Testing the depth of a river * Helping another Scout over a high wall * Construction of a light bridge, hut or flag staff * Stopping a car by jamming a staff through the spokes of the wheel * Self-defence * A tent pole for a small tent * Feeling your way over rough or marshy ground * Measuring distancesStarting to Scout: Tenderfoot and Second Class Tests, The Canadian General Council of the Boy Scouts' Association, Ottawa 1944 (p. 7) * Estimating the height of trees or tall buildingsTenderfoot to Queen’s Scout 1955 (pp. 84-85) * Linking Scouts together on a night hike * Making a splint for an injured leg * Stopping an aggressive dog * Beating out bush fires References Category:Hiking equipment Category:Scouting uniform Category:Scoutcraft ","title":"Scout staff"},{"id":"42157374","text":"Lisanne de Witte (born 10 September 1992) is a Dutch sprinter.

In 1963, she became the American representative of Galleria Del Deposito, which featured work by European artists who made functional art objects, such as trays or jewels. She co-directed the Los Angeles Gallery 669 with founder Riko Mizuno from 1967. Butler ran the Eugenia Butler Gallery on La Cienega from 1968 to 1971. Her gallery showed the work of conceptual artists, including John Baldessari, James Lee Byars, Douglas Huebler, and her daughter, Eugenia P. Butler. Life and family Born Eugenia Louise Jefferson in Bakersfield, California in 1922, Butler grew up in Los Angeles. She attended Scripps College and served as a master sergeant in the Marines during World War II where she met her future husband James G. Butler, a lawyer and fighter pilot. After World War II, the pair moved to South Rimpau street and had eight children. Their daughter, Eugenia P. Butler, went on to become a contemporary artist. The younger Butler's work was shown in Butler's gallery. After the closing of her gallery in 1971, Butler was diagnosed with breast cancer and received a mastectomy. It was around this time that she began an affair with fellow artist Paul Cotton and left her family to move with him to San Francisco. At Documenta, an art exhibition in Kassel, Germany in 1972, Butler arrived nude riding a white horse. It was there she attempted to impersonate her daughter Eugenia P. Butler and pass off her work as her own. Plagued by mental illness and personal turmoil, Butler never opened another gallery. Career Butler served on LACMA's Contemporary Art Council and New Talent Award Committee in the mid 1960s. An avid collector, Butler traveled to galleries across Europe. It was at this time that Butler was introduced to Galleria del Deposito, a Genoa based art collective of which Lucio Fontana, Victor Vasarely, and Eugenio Carmi were a part. In 1966 Butler became the Los Angeles representative for Galleria del Deposito. In 1967, Butler partnered with Riko Mizuno, the gallerist running Gallery 669, for a single year. The two presented groundbreaking exhibitions such as Joseph Kosuth's first solo show in the United States, \\"Nothing\\" and the work of Richard Jackson. The Eugenia Butler Gallery Butler opened her namesake gallery in 1968 after parting ways with Riko Mizuno. Butler's main focus for her gallery was on conceptual art consisting of dematerialized and non-object oriented work. She was an early champion of conceptual art, developing the hallmarks of space, interaction and performance. The gallery opened with Allen Rupperberg's first solo show where he presented \\"Location Piece\\". Later that same year James Lee Bryars, a conceptual and performance artist, built a block wall separating Butler's office from the gallery. Butler also presented conceptual artist John Baldessari's second gallery exhibition in 1970. Butler was the first person to sell one of Baldessari's photographs. The most controversial piece to come out of the Eugenia Butler Gallery was Swiss artist Dieter Roth's exhibition, \\"Staple Cheese (A Race)\\" (1970). Roth filled 37 suitcases with cheese and left them in the gallery during summer. The health department's attempts to shut the exhibition down were thwarted by Butler's husband on the grounds of artistic merit.

Miyashiro, who was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, first came to prominence in 1961 while still a student at Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles, when he appeared on the controversial poster for \\"War Babies,\\" an influential exhibition at Henry Hopkins' Huysman Gallery in Los Angeles, along with his friends and contemporaries Larry Bell, Ed Bereal, and Joe Goode. Miyashiro later moved from Los Angeles to New York City where he continues to make work in multiple media. His early work has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, and has been included in a number of high-profile museum exhibitions devoted to art from the 1960s. Education Miyashiro moved to Los Angeles, California in 1957, at the age of 19 to attend Chouinard, at the instigation of a cousin. Without a portfolio or any prior training in visual art, Miyashiro was forced to take private lessons in order to create a portfolio so that he could get into Chouinard's program. While there, he studied painting with Robert Irwin, who introduced Miyashiro to the use of inexpensive house paints and strategies of assemblage. Irwin's influence led directly to Miyashiro's major works of the early 1960s, wall- mounted small-scale assemblages consisting of found objects and dark, thick paint. Richards Ruben, who was a major exponent of abstract expressionism in southern California, was also teaching at the time at Chouinard and was another important influence. The postwar period at Chouinard was a high point for the institution, which became a seedbed for abstract expressionist practice in California, a key context for Miyashiro's work in the early 1960s. \\"War Babies\\" In 1961, Miyashiro was one of four artists who appeared in \\"War Babies,\\" an exhibition curated by Henry Hopkins at the Huysman Gallery in Los Angeles. The exhibition's poster, which featured Miyashiro, Bell, Goode and Bereal eating foods stereotypically associated with their respective ethnicities, attracted controversy and criticism from sources as diverse as the John Birch Society on the right (for the poster's alleged desecration of the American flag) and from voices on the left decrying its use of stereotypes. Miyashiro's work at the time consisted of paintings and elegant, small-scale charcoal drawings that were, according to Henry Hopkins, \\"very black and very dark drawings of vaginal shapes, very rich oily, charcoal things. There would be a kind of slit in the middle.\\" Miyashiro later moved to New York where, facing financial difficulties, he returned to jewelry making as a way of making ends meet, while continuing to work as an artist in other mediums. Exhibitions Miyashiro's work has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, and has been included in several high-profile group exhibitions devoted to art in Los Angeles in the 1960s. In 1988, he was featured in Lost and Found in California : Four Decades of Assemblage Art, published in conjunction with a series of exhibitions organized by James Corcoran Gallery in Santa Monica. In 2010, Miyashiro participated in \\"circa 1962,\\" a two-person show at Cardwell Jimmerson gallery in Culver City in 2010, alongside the work of Jim Eller. In 2011, Miyashiro's work was included in the group exhibition \\"Now Dig This! Art in Black Los Angeles 1960-1980\\" at UCLA's Hammer Museum alongside works by Noah Purifoy, John Outterbridge, Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, Charles White as well as other non-African American artists including Mark di Suvero, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, Gordon Wagner and others.

He was of Romani origin, born in the Podvorce neighbourhood of Leskovac. The battle started 50 km earlier than the Serbian troops expected as the better prepared Ottomans surprised them. Ademović reached the opponents' part of the plain and got behind them, where he sounded for retreatment and got the Turkish (Ottoman) lines confused, and starting to retreat. As fast as he could, he ran back to the Serbian troops and sounded for attack. Ahmed's cleverness made him one of the heroes of the battle won by the Serbians. On 3 December 1941 Ademović's two sons were executed along with some 300 or 400–500 Romani by German troops at Arapova dolina in the outskirts of Leskovac. Following this he did never play his trumpet again. He wore his decoration until his death at 92 years of age. There were two other Romani who received Karađorđe's Star, both trumpeters and both from Leskovac: Ahmet Ametović (for the Battle of Bregalnica) and (for the Battle of Kaymakchalan). It has been decided by a veterans' descendants organization to erect a statue, memorial sign or name a street in Leskovac in his honour.

Permanent exhibit at Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Holocaust tourism is round-trip travel to destinations connected with the extermination of Jews during the Holocaust in World War II, including visits to sites of Jewish martyrology such as former Nazi death camps and concentration camps turned into state museums. It belongs to a category of the so-called 'roots tourism' usually across parts of Central Europe, or more generally, the Western-style dark tourism to sites of death and disaster. The term Holocaust, first used in the late 1950s, was derived from the Greek word holokauston meaning a completely burnt offering to God. It has come to symbolize the systematic extermination of approximately six million European Jews by Nazi Germany in occupied territories from 1933 to 1945.Holocaust museum Houston, Terms Related to the Holocaust. Retrieved August 11, 2015. The term can also be applied to mean the estimated five to seven million non- Jewish victims who were murdered by the Nazis in the same time period.  Dark tourism spectrum  The term 'dark tourism' was first coined in 1996. According to P. R. Stone, there is a dark tourism spectrum, which differentiates between the shades of the dark tourism:P.R. Stone. A dark tourism spectrum: Towards a typology of death and macabre related tourist sites, attractions and exhibition. (PDF file, direct download 252 KB), Vol. 54, No. 2, 2006, pp. 148, 151 (5-8/17 in PDF). From: Selected Works of Dr. Philip Stone. University of Central Lancashire. Retrieved 12 August 2015. :{ style=\\"width:50%; margin-right:auto; border:none; border-spacing:7px; font- size:90%;\\" - style=\\"text-align:center;\\" style=\\"background:#000000\\" darkest style=\\"background:#696969\\" darker style=\\"background:#808080\\" dark style=\\"background:#A9A9A9\\"light style=\\"background:#C0C0C0\\"lighter style=\\"background:#D3D3D3\\"lightest } The spectrum aids in identifying the intensity of both the framework of supply and the consumption. The darkest tourism is characterized by the following elements: education orientation, historic background, location authenticity in terms of relics (non- purposefulness), and limited tourism infrastructure. The objects of lightest tourism have mostly opposite features: entertainment orientation, commercial centralization, inauthenticity, commercial purposefulness, and higher level of tourism infrastructure. Professor William F. S. Miles stipulates that death and violent events – transmitted between generations through survivors and witnesses – are darker than other events. Miles also notes that the level of darkness of a tourist destination may partially depend on the family background of the prospective tourists. Stone distinguishes seven dark suppliers, which create the dark tourism product and experience. The model of seven dark suppliers demonstrate dark tourism as multi-faceted phenomenon, with the extermination camp at Auschwitz-Birkenau conceivably the darkest in terms of influence. The Dark Camps of Genocide are sites where genocide and violence were actually perpetrated. All such sites belong to this category. Auschwitz was the largest of the Nazi death camps in World War II, and is at the top of this list. Holocaust sites usually depend on government's sponsorship. Among the seven dark suppliers are also war sites and battlefields (Dark Conflict Sites), places of remembrances (Dark Shrines), cemeteries of famous people (Dark Resting Places), prisons and courthouses (Dark Dungeons), exhibits associated with death and suffering (Dark Exhibitions), and finally, the tourist sites which emphasize entertainment (Dark Fun Factories). Postmemory and Jewish identity March of the living from Auschwitz to Birkenau Holocaust tourism sites are related to 'postmemory' as well as cultural identity, with postmemory being an important element in the motivations of Holocaust tourists. Marianne Hirsch defines it in the following way. Postmemory is an interrelation between survivors, and post- Holocaust generations of Jews, to save and transmit the Holocaust experience. The first studies regarding the second generation began to appear in the 1970s. For example, Helen Epstein's 1979 book Children of the Holocaust: Conversations with Sons and Daughters of Survivors consists of interviews with survivors' children from all over the world.Helen Epstein (2008), Children of the Holocaust: Conversations With Sons and Daughters of Survivors. Paw Prints, . Some survivors' children's identities are dependent on their parents' Holocaust experience. The Jewish visits to Holocaust sites are often efforts to explore the origins of their identity. Erica Lehrer considers this Jewish identity quest as \\"a way to step into the flow of family, community, and history from which one feels displaced\\".Lehrer, Erica T. Jewish Poland Revisited: Heritage Tourism in Unquiet Places. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013, p. 101. Many Jewish tours are made to establish a connection of survivors and second generation with an unknown place and or identity. In Central Europe Holocaust map of Poland During the last 20 years Central Europe has become the most popular region for Jewish heritage travels. The recent increase in tourism is due to several historic events which have opened the region: Poland's Solidarity movement; Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of glasnost and perestroika; and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Though many of the tourists have no direct experience of the Holocaust, many Holocaust tours visit authentic Holocaust sites, such as cemeteries and crematoria. Two principal destinations of Holocaust tourism are Poland and Israel. The relationship between those two countries in Holocaust tourism was best illustrated by the anthropologist Jack Kugelmass who employed a 'performance approach' to the Shoa group missions. In Israel, the March of the Living (MOTL) was established in 1988, which organizes Holocaust tours for teenagers. Annually, MOTL sends thousands of young people from more than fifty countries to Poland and Israel. Poland is one of the countries most visited by Holocaust tourists due to the number of death camps in Poland. Prior to World War II, Poland had the largest Jewish community in Europe, of which over three million (90%) were murdered. Death and labor camps were built in Central Europe by the German occupational authorities in the late 1930s and early 1940s, many of them in Poland, of which Auschwitz was the first and largest. In the period between 1941 and 1944 other death camps were established by the Reich in occupied Poland including Majdanek (in Lublin); Birkenau (in Brzezinka); Treblinka (near the village of Treblinka); Bełżec (south-east of Lublin); Sobibór (near the village of Sobibor); Chełmno (near the village of Chełmno nad Nerem).Robert D. Cherry, Annamaria Orla-Bukowska, Rethinking Poles and Jews: Troubled Past, Brighter Future, Rowman & Littlefield, 2007, , Google Print, p. 5. Critical view Holocaust tourism, despite its short existence, has come under criticism. Polish journalist and Jewish activist Konstanty Gebert noted: Anthropologist Jack Kugelmass wrote that the American trips to Poland, sponsored by the Israeli Ministry of Education, promote death rather than life, because the Holocaust sites allow for a strong emotional appeal to a mythologised identity. By the same token, the propagandist messages imposed by the organizers upon students participating in the Shoah voyages are nationalistic rather than universalistic, and inevitably, impact on their empathy toward the Palestinians as well. The criticism of the Shoah group missions by the Israeli News and Opinion had focused on its economic aspect, with individual members calling for a generalized boycott of Poland's Holocaust-related sites. In order to stop the infusion of tourism monies, prominent Rabbis advocated that Jews refrain from going to Poland even if they wished to participate only in the official March of the Living. Quest tourism alternative Quest tourism, or the 'roots tourism', is a type of cultural and ethnographic tourism focused on Jewish heritage and their extermination as a historical tragedy. This term was first used by E. Lehrer.Jewish Poland Revisited: Heritage Tourism in Unquiet Places. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2013. It is different from Holocaust tourism because of its orientation to the tragic aspect of Jewish Heritage. Quest tourists have specific motivations and may be characterized by the following features: # they are, as a rule, descendants of Holocaust survivors; # they travel individually or with close friends and family; # they are highly interested in travel; # they possess strong postmemory; # their goal is to reveal the story and overcome the communal ideology. Virtual Jewish communities There are three communities on the internet in which Jewish- related concerns and news are disseminated, particularly regarding Holocaust tourism in Germany and across Central Europe. As described by J. S. Podoshen and J. M. Hunt they are: #Jewish Current Events. A primarily North American and Israeli forum with thousands of postings concerning world events, as well as Jewish-related news from global Jewish periodicals. #Religious Judaism. A community of over four thousands American orthodox and conservative Jews, whose main interest is Judaism and its spread throughout the world. The community is subdivided into groups based on geographic areas. The group has published over one million posts, and according to the community's archive, the Holocaust in relation to tourism is one of the most discussed topics. #Israeli News and Opinion. A site made up of Jews living in and near Israel, which discusses news from popular Israeli and Jewish press sources. Notes  References  * Erica Lehrer.

He is well known for his scientific contributions to the development of the theories of global tectonics (applied to the study of the geology of the Carpathian Mountains), for his pioneering in speleology and for the development of this science, but also for the popularization of science and of ecology in Romania. Marcian Bleahu is the author of more than 41 books and 126 scientific papers, of more than 400 articles on different topics. He has more than 500 public appearances as a speaker, including the radio and the television, he is a pioneer in using the multimedia in conferences, he is the author of the first geological map of Romania. As such, Marcian Bleahu is one of the most important Romanian scientific personalities of the second half of the last century. His books and his conferences have inspired generations of youth fond of nature, mountains, the exploration of the caves in Romania, and he has been, at the same time, a mentor for many Romanian geologists after the second World War.  Biography  Marcian David Bleahu was born on March 14, 1924, in Brașov, in the family of a notary, but his maternal ancestry goes up to the prince Constantin Brâncoveanu.Spovedania unui neînvins - Marcian Bleahu, Editura Paideia, 2006, București He was enlisted during the World War II. He graduated from school and high-school in Brașov. In 1949, he graduated from the Faculty of Sciences (Sections of Natural Sciences and Geography) of the University of Bucharest. In 1974 he obtains a PhD with a thesis about the Geology and the Morphology of the Karst and of the Caves, at the University of Cluj. He begins his teaching activity at the Geology Department of Bucharest University, where he was a teaching assistant, lecturer and associate professor between 1949 and 1961. He was eliminated from the teaching system for political reasons, and he started again his university career after 1989, when, together with prof. Dolfi Drimer, he founded the Ecological University, where he was appointed as Dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences (afterwards transformed in Faculty of Ecology). Between 1949 - 1994, Marcian Bleahu worked as a geologist, a researcher and as a manager (including General Manager) at the Geological Institute of Romania. He was elected as a senator for the legislatures 1990-1992 and 1996-2000, on the lists of the Romanian Ecologist Movement, and of the Romanian Ecologist Federation.Marcian David Bleahu - Parliamentary activity in legislature 1996-2000 Between 1991 - 1992 he was the Minister of the Environment. He has received several awards and decorations; in 2008 he was decorated with the Order \\"Steaua Româniai\\" (\\"The Star of Romania\\") as Knight, which is the highest Romanian civil order. At present, he has retired from the public activity, but he continues to write articles and books in several fields, including music (he is known as a sophisticated melomaniac), or ecology.  Professional career  After graduation, in 1949, Marcian Bleahu joins the Geology Department of the Bucharest University. He teaches the first classes of Structural Geology and of the Geology of the Quaternary. In 1961 he is eliminated from the Department by the communist administration, on political grounds. On April 4, 1990, together with Dolphi Drimer, Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecological University, the first private university in Romania and the only university with an ecological profile. Dolphi Drimer becomes the rector of this university and Marcian Bleahu is appointed as dean of the Faculty of Natural Sciences (later on named Faculty of Ecology), where he teaches Dynamic Geology, Physical Geography of Romania, Geology of Romania, Protection of nature and protected areas. He ends his teaching career in 2001. Between 1949 - 1994, simultaneously with his teaching activity, Marcian Bleahu worked as a geologist at the Geological Institute, where he implements most of his scientific activities. Between 1952 - 1985, he does a long series of research in the Carpathian Mountains, mainly in the Apuseni. During all these 33 years of field research, he synthesized and made public the stratigraphy and the structure of the Apuseni Mountains. The papers he published in this field are the first scientific source about the geology of the Maramures, Bihor, Codru-Moma and Metaliferic Mountains - he dedicated to each of them a monography. These researches had an important impact on synthesis of national interest, such as coal deposits, Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations, but also from the tectonic point of view, in the general works about the structure of the territory, as well as in the integration of these researches in the wider framework of the study of Triassic paleography in Eastern Europe. Directly, or by coordinating teams of geologists, Marcian Bleahu also produced over 50 maps (pages) component of the Geological Map of Romania, on a scale of 1:200.000, for which he also made the state standards in the field.Geology of Romania - B.C.

A special chapter of this field activity was the study of karstology, meaning the exploration, the mapping and the research of the caves in the Apuseni mountains,Sur les confluences souterraines - International Journal of Speology almost unknown until then: Peștera de la Căput, Peștera Buciumul Sucit, Peștera Vântului, Peștera Vadu Crișului, Peștera Șura Mare, Peștera din Peretele Dârnini, Peștera Coliboaia, Avenul de sub Pietruța, Peștera Izvorul Tăușoarelor, Peștera-aven ghețarul de sub Zgurăști, Peștera Cetatea Rădesei, Peștera Pojarul Poliței, Peștera Scărișoara, Peștera Huda lui Papară, Vânătările Ponorului, Izbucul de la Cotețul Dobreștilor, Avenul de sub Colții Grindului, Peștera Gaura cu Muscă, Peștera Bolii, Peștera Neagră, Peștera Ghețarul de la Vârtop, Avenul din Piatra Ceții, Peștera Calului, Peștera Bisericuța, Peștera din Dealul Cornului, Peștera Mică de la Vânătare, Peștera Dâlbina, Peștera Corobana lui Gârtău, Peștera V5, Peștera Poarta lui Ionele, Avenul din Șesuri etc. In 1976 he publishes Caves from Romania \\"Peșteri din România\\", which becomes one of the first scientific best-sellers in Romania. All these researches, as well as the world scientific trends of the '60s in the field of plate tectonics catalyses Marcian Bleahu's research activity and he becomes a pioneer in the field of global tectonics not only in Romania, but also with significant contributions in the international scientific community.Bibliography of Continental Drift and Plate Tectonics - Tina Kasbeer, The Geological Society of America, 1975 The results of his studies were synthesized in the book Global tectonics - Bucharest, 1983, Editura Științifică, (Tectonica globală), in two volumes, with over 1000 pages. Despite the opposition of the scientific world of that time, which got quickly past any debate over ideas and arrived at the political questioning of the research results (the communist authorities forbade him to leave the country for 6 years, 1978 - 1984), Marcian Bleahu managed to thrust his theories, and he was invited in 1974, 1976 and 1978 to teach at the University in Geneva the first course in Global Tectonics; he also gave conferences in Vienna, Zurich, Freiburg, Basel, Potsdam, etc. Between 1949 - 1952 he was the manager of the geology service for the Danube - Black Sea Canal. In 1953, he coordinated the geological research for the project of Bucharest Metro. He was a member of the inter-ministerial commission of analysis for the Earthquake on March 4th 1977. Between 1985 - 1994 he was a member of the team that founded and coordinated The National Museum of Geology in Bucharest.  Political career  While a student, he sympathized with the National Liberal Party, but he was not a member of any political party until 1965, when he joins the Romanian Communist Party, in order to be appointed on a management position in the Geological Institute. If, politically, his activity until 1990 was almost non-existent, from the professional point of view he will be remembered as the founder of the National Museum of Geology, in 1985, where he also worked as a scientific coordinator, until 1994. After the Revolution in December 1989, Marcian Bleahu founds the Ecologist Movement in Romania, thus putting into practice his professional belief regarding the protection of nature and of environment. He is elected as a senator in May 1990, in the first free post-communist Parliament and he becomes the Minister of Environment in the Stolojan cabinet. In this position, he elaborated the legislation in the field (again, a pioneer work) and he tried to integrate Romania in the international conventions and programs regarding the environment. In 1992 he is appointed vice-president of the UN Conference for environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. In 1996 he is elected again as a senator, on the lists of the Democratic Convention, for the Ecologist Federation of Romania. He was a member of the Commission for Foreign Affairs and of the parliamentary group of the National Liberal Party. In 2008 he is appointed as President of Honor of the Green Party, successor of the Ecologist Federation of Romania.

While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they have been administratively obsolete since 1898. However, they continue to be used in land registration and in specification, such as in planning permissions. In many cases, a barony corresponds to an earlier Gaelic túath which had submitted to the Crown.

History  The construction of the Christoffelkerk, which began in 1410 and was initially designed as a basilica on a cruciform ground plan, was intended to replace an older parish church outside the walls of the town of Roermond. During the 15th century the building plans were changed; the choir was completed as a three-aisled hall, the nave was built with five naves. The building was completed in the course of the 16th century. In 1661 the church was elevated to the status of bishop's church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Roermond, established in 1559. In World War II the church suffered heavy damage when German troops blew up the 78-metre-high tower built into the western part of the nave on the day before the liberation of the town by Allied troops. The tower has been restored to its old form after the war. The earthquake in the Roermond area in 1992 caused further damage. A new, comprehensive renovation took place in the years 2005 to 2007.

It was previously administered as part of Jamshed Town,Jamshed Town - Government of Karachi which was disbanded in 2011. It is one of the government colonies like Martin Quarters, Clyton Quarters or Jamshed Quarters in Karachi, where housing unite is allotted to an employee of federal government according to entitlement and transfer of house allowance from his/her monthly remuneration as rent to the Estate Office, a department in the Ministry of Housing & Works. Retired government servants may, for a specific period, continue the occupancy of his/her allotted residence on payment of standard rent in the Estate Office. It is also described that after the independence of Pakistan in 1947, thousands of Muslim migrated to Pakistan and faced housing crisis. In 1953, Prime Minister Muhammad Ali Bogra had initiated the housing scheme for the refugees including Pakistan Quarters.A story behind every name There are several ethnic groups including Muhajirs, Punjabis, Sindhis, Kashmiris, Seraikis, Pakhtuns, Balochis, Memons, Bohras Ismailis and Christians. Claims & hardships Residents of Government colonies, including Pakistan Quarters have been demanding ownership on the basis of longstanding occupation. In 2003 representatives of Government colonies through a press conference at Karachi Press Club condemned the eviction notices for dislodging retired government servants and the heirs of the employees who died during their services or after retirement. They demanded allotment of land of housing units at a reasonable price for the transfer of ownership to occupants most of them were children of founders of Pakistan. Earlier to 2008 Housing Ministry has twice moved its summary to the Federal Cabinet for awarding ownership rights to people living in government colonies in Karachi and sector G-6 of Islamabad, which were rejected. The residents of Government colonies had raised their complaints about the encroachments and influence of land mafia for decades. Reportedly not only the land grabbers but also the concerned offices have provided houses on rent and sold an illegally constructed house or shop. According to a surveyor report published in the print media, besides encroachments, detail of residents was depicted as: :* 60% houses/flats are in possession of serving government employees :* 30% belong to retired servants or their families :* 10% by illegal occupants. The federal government had declared illegal occupants to peoples living in the government quarters at Martin Road, Jehangir Road, F. C. Area, Pakistan Quarters, etc. Many families living in these quarters have been there for decades and they also claim to be legal owners of their houses which were allotted to their ancestors who were founding member of Pakistan. However, Eviction Notices to the families of deceased or retired government servants have been issued since 1980. = Political promises = Elder residents of government colonies describe that since the period of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, various political leaders had, from time to time, assured the residents for award of ownership of allotted housing unite. = Ownership certificates = The then care taker minister for Housing & Works, disclosed that the government would allot quarters to its employees on an ownership basis at Pakistan & Martin Quarters Consequently in its first phase, 1,736 eligibility certificates on the basis of long-standing occupancy were distributed to the residents of Martin Quarters, Clyton Quarters, Patel Para in September 2006. Later 394 residents of Pakistan Quarters were also awarded similar certificates. Subsequently Federal Housing Minister stated that eligibility certificates issued to the residents of government colonies had no legal value and could be withdrawn. However, no letter or notice was served to the residents, in manner the eligibility certificates issued. In 2008, the then Secretary of Ministry of Housing & Works stated that a committee was set up by the former Prime Minister for deliberation of a proposal to award the ownership eligibility certificates to the residents of government quarters on the basis of their long stay in the housing units of government colonies in Karachi and Islamabad. During 2006, Syed Safwanullah, the Federal Minister of Housing and Works issued the proposed certificates at his discretion without waiting for the approval of the policy Petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan Per Resolution: 2004/28 of High Commission for Human Rights Forced eviction is prohibited. In response to eviction notices, affected residents living in the government colonies filed a petition in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, but could not satisfy the court. In July-2018 the Supreme Court of Pakistan ordered to get the housing unites situated in Pakistan Quarters, Martin Quarters, Jamshed Quarters, Clayton Quarters, Federal Capital Area, and other colonies of Karachi evacuated within 10 days from the alleged illegal occupants Reportedly family members living in the Pakistan Quarters and other government colonies after retirement or death of a government servant whom the quarter was allotted protested outside Supreme Court Karachi Registry against the issued verdict. = Police Operation = On 24 October-2018, 16 people injured and dozens were arrested during a protest against the operation to evict the Pakistan Quarters by its longstanding residents. Death of one woman was also reported when Police used to baton- charge and fired tear gas to disperse the mob. Consequently Chief Justice of Pakistan ordered to hold the evacuation process and pended it for a period of three months. Operation was condemned by leaders of different political parties of Pakistan, including PTI local representatives. Members of different Political parties in Karachi, including Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) disliked the police action in Pakistan Quarters on 24 October-2018 and appealed the federal government to resolve the very old issue by granting ownership rights to the residents of the government quarters. However, mixed reaction was noticed at national level. Chief Minister of Sindh ordered immediate withdrawal of police from the area and expressed his displeasure over the police action in Pakistan Quarters. It is further added that he would take-up the issue with the provincial administration and Law Department, and also approach the Supreme Court if necessary with a view to arrive at a resolution on \\"humanitarian grounds\\" See also Patel Para References  External links  * Karachi Website.

He is also known for his works on paper, including works with ink, collage, drawing, paint and poetry. The prolific Herms has also created theater pieces, about which he has said, \\"I treat it as a Joseph Cornell box big enough that you can walk around in. It's just a continuation of my sculpture, one year at a time.\\" Legendary curator Walter Hopps, who met Herms in 1956, \\"placed Herms on a dazzling continuum of assemblage artists that includes Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Marcel Duchamp, and Joseph Cornell, as well as California luminaries Wallace Berman and Edward Kienholz.\\" Often called a member of the West Coast Beat movement, Herms said that Wallace Berman taught him that \\"any object, even a mundane cast-off, could be of great interest if contextualized properly.\\" \\"That’s my whole thing,\\" Herms says. \\"I turn shit into gold. I just really want to see something I've never seen before.\\" George Herms lives and works in Los Angeles. Early life and education George Herms was born in 1935 in Woodland, California. His grandfather was an entomologist and one-time mayor of Berkeley, California, and his father was an agronomist. During World War II, Herms was sent by his parents to the College of Engineering at Berkeley, which he left after approximately six weeks when \\"the football season was over.\\" Subsequently, he worked for Remington Rand, on the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC), before leaving for Mexico and other travels. His parents offered him $100 per month to return to college, so he took the money and \\"bought some jazz records and lived on $13 per month,\\" and returned to Los Angeles, living for some time in Topanga Canyon, where he met the artists Wallace Berman and Robert Alexander on the occasion of his 20th birthday. Herms helped Wallace Berman hang his first show in 1957 at Ferus Gallery. Reportedly, Herms decided to become an artist when a transient sat down next to him in a Sacramento bus depot and said, \\"There's the makers, the takers, and the fakers. Which will you be?\\" Herms did not have a formal art school education, yet he has been called the \\"godfather of West Coast assemblage art.\\" During the late 1950s, Herms resided in a number of different cities in California, including Berkeley, Larkspur and Hermosa Beach before returning for a short period of time to Topanga in 1961. In 1959, Herms became an original member of Bruce Conner's Rat Bastard Protective Association.Its members included Jay de Feo, Michael McClure, Manuel Neri and Joan Brown. See Rebecca Solnit, ‘Heretical Constellations: Notes on California, 1946–61’, in Sussman, ed., Beat Culture and the New America, 69–122, especially 71. Teaching and residencies Herms has been a lecturer in Studio Art at University of California, Irvine and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); Sculpture at UCLA and University of California, San Diego; and, Public Art at the Santa Monica College of Design, Art and Architecture. From 1977 to 1979, he was a Visiting Artist at California State University, Fullerton.

The name Craigellachie means 'rocky hill' and refers to the cliff that overlooks the Spey across from The Macallan distillery. Bacardi operates the distillery through its subsidiary Dewar & Sons. Dewar & Sons also controls Royal Brackla, Aberfeldy, Aultmore, and Macduff. History The Craigellachie distillery was built in 1891 by Craigellachie Distillery Co. Limited, a group of blenders and merchants led by Alexander Edward. Two years later, it was incorporated as a limited company and in 1896 it was reconstructed as Craigellachie-Glenlivet Distillery Ltd. During the years that followed, ownership passed to Peter Mackie (in 1916), the Distillery Company Limited (in 1927) and SMD (in 1930). The transfer to SMD marked the beginning of a period of stability for Craigellachie; apart from a reconstruction in 1964-65 during which the number of pot stills was doubled, relatively little happened at the distillery. In 1998, it was sold to John Dewar & Sons. During its history, the distillery has released only a handful of official bottlings. The distillery's product is currently primarily used for Dewar's blended whisky. In 2014, a 13-year-old, 17-year-old, a travel retail exclusive 19-year-old, and a limited 23-year-old were released as part of the Dewar & Sons' Last Great Malts of Scotland.

In 1973 artist Mario Gonzales and Ruben Reyna painted the mural. Both Mario Gonzales and Ruben Reyna were Vietnam veterans and UH students. Funding for the mural was obtained from the university's chapter of the Mexican American Youth Organization. The mural depicts the political angst of the Chicano Movement, featuring Uncle Sam with a skull in place of a head, an effect popular in twentieth-century Mexican and Chicano art. It is twelve by fifty five feet in height and length. Subjects \\"The left side of the mural features images of Aztecs, farmers (campesinos) and images of Mexico's history and fore fathers. Painted by Reyna are, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, Father Miguel Hidalgo, Benito Juarez, Emiliano Zapata, Pancho Villa, President Lazaro Cardenas and the power of the Catholic Church. Representing the women's active role and participation in the Mexican revolutions, one sees \\"La Adelita\\" holding the Mexican flag, as she leads an army of campesinos forward in this struggle. On the far left, Reyna painted the Aztecs being tortured at the stake, as a representation of the Spaniard's conquest of their wealth and lands. On the right side of the mural, Gonzales painted images of historical figures of the 60s and 70s—Cesar Chavez, Alicia Escalante, Reies Lopez Tijerina, and a sea of people demanding change,\\" explains a KUHF article. The article continues with an explanation by Ruben Reyna. \\"I painted the left section of the mural and Mario painted the right and we met in the middle, which is the future of the Chicano,' Reyna said. 'We painted the past, the history of Mexico, our beginnings from the days of the Spaniard conquest of the Aztecas. We brought it to the far right (of the mural) and identified some key figures of the Chicano movement.'\\" In one portion of the mural, lady justice is depicted holding an unbalanced scale, defining the inequality of justice in America. However, the central portion of the mural is perhaps the most iconographic. Gonzales states that the young man in the middle of the mural has reached the step stones of educational success, where he is confronted by his conscience, which is \\"Moctezuma, Moteuczomatzin Ilhuicamina\\" and all the history of his ancestors. He is also embraced by his government, which is depicted as the skeletal figure in Uncle Sam garb. The young man is faced with a choice of what to make of his life, his education and accomplishments. Will he think of just himself or help make a change in Humanity. In conclusion, the theme is for all humans regardless of race or color, should attempt to change the world to create a more unified and humane society. An invitation is extended to all the students, who are the force that can make a change in the world. They are encouraged to: \\"Don’t forget their roots, work for the well being and for the prosperity of not just the Hispanics but of the entire world.\\" 1995 Threat In 1995 the University Center Policy Board proposed the removal of the mural, as part of an effort to change the theme of the University Center. Hispanic Student Association President Russell Contreras spearheaded efforts to encourage Chicano students to attend a policy board meeting in favor of preserving the mural. He mentions that these were not the first efforts to have the mural removed. A coalition of students wrote a letter to the editor of the campus newspaper, the Daily Cougar. Many administrators were in favor of moving the mural, which is painted on a scroll and attached to the wall. In the end, student protests prevailed and the mural was not moved. 2012 Threat and resolution In December 2011, while a major renovation to the University Center was about to begin, the University of Houston refused to give written assurances to activists and alumna indicating that the mural would be preserved and displayed in the remodeled University Center. Instead, the university offered the possibility of digitizing an image of the piece. Contributing to alumna and student concerns was the fact that the year before several murals had been whitewashed at TSU, a university about one mile away. Protests, press conferences and petitions were quickly organized. In January 2012 the University of Houston formally agreed to preserve the mural and to prominently feature the mural in the University Center's new building design. Diana Gutierrez, a student at the university, did a great deal of campus organizing on behalf of the mural. She did an interview with Mi Casa Broadcasting, explaining her thoughts. Professor Lorenzo Cano, Associate Dean for the Center for Mexican American Studies, was involved in the original efforts to have the mural painted. In at least one interview, he spoke about the murals significance, commenting that when he was enrolled, the Chicano community was not represented very well. After the university had committed to preserving the mural, the university Art Acquisition Committee took over the management of the preservation. Soon after, Mr. Gonzales requested permission to paint an addition to the lower section of the mural, representing the protests and efforts to save the mural and the miracle that the mural was preserved entitled \\"En Los Manos de Dios\\", translated \\"In the Hands of God\\". Mr Gonzales was opposed by fellow artist, Ruben Reyna, who was against any changes being made to the originality of the mural and was supported by Mr. Lorenzo Cano and Tatcho Mindiola, the Director of the Center for Mexican American Studies at UofH. The University System-wide Art Acquisition Committee (SWAAC) denied ,artist Gonzales' request to add this addition to the mural. The System-wide Art Acquisition Committee is now in charge of caring for the mural. On January 28, 2014 the University of Houston unveiled the restored piece, which is now on display in the Barnes & Noble student bookstore, located in the University Center. Significance beyond university The Chicano Mural movement has been recognized internationally as a significant cultural contribution. The Texas State Historical Commission mentions that the Chicano Mural Movement of the 1960s and 70's helped to affirm cultural identity and to challenge racism. The association's website chronicles many murals which were removed or painted over due to controversial themes. Many fell into poor conditions due to their location on exterior walls. La Marcha Por La Humanidad seems to be one which has withstood challenges to its message, and may be one of the best preserved murals of the period.

Barry is a member of the Democratic Party.  Early life and education  Barry was born on September 22, 1963, in Santa Ana, California and grew up in Overland Park, Kansas where she graduated from the private all- girls Notre Dame de Sion School in nearby Kansas City, Missouri. She earned a bachelor's degree in elementary education from Baker University in Baldwin City, Kansas in 1986, where she was a member of Alpha Chi Omega. She also earned an MBA from the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt University in 1993. Business career Barry worked in business ethics and corporate responsibility for the multinational telecommunications firm Nortel Networks. From 2003 to 2012, Barry was vice president of ethics and compliance at Premier, Inc., a health-care group purchasing organization. She also worked as principal of Barry & Associates, an independent consulting organization to multinational corporations on issues dealing with business ethics and corporate social responsibility. Political career =Metropolitan Councilwoman-at-Large= Barry was first elected to one of the five at-large seats on the 40-member Metro Council in September 2007, and won re-election to a second four-year term in August 2011. In winning re-election, she was the top vote getter among the five incumbents who all successfully sought a second term.Joey Garrison, \\"With a Blend of Progressivism and Business Acumen, Barry Sets Up Her Future\\" , Nashville City Paper, August 14, 2011. During her first term on the council, Barry chaired the council's Budget and Finance Committee and the Education Committee. In 2009, she led an effort in the council to pass a bill banning discrimination against city employees based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Julie Bolcer, \\"Nashville Nondiscrimination\\", The Advocate, September 17, 2009. During the 2013-14 council year, she chaired the Rules Committee and served as a member of the Budget and Finance Committee and the Personnel Committee. Barry performed the first same-sex wedding in Nashville on June 26, 2015. =2015 mayoral campaign= Barry started her mayoral campaign in April 2013, filing paperwork with the Davidson County Election Commission naming Nashville attorney Leigh Walton as her campaign's treasurer.Joey Garrison, \\"Council's Megan Barry lays groundwork for potential mayoral run\\", The Tennessean, April 23, 2013. She received the largest total of votes for mayor in this election, but did not achieve an absolute majority of votes cast in the race, setting up her runoff race against hedge fund manager David Fox, the second-place finisher. Although major media in Nashville touted apartment landlord Bill Freeman as odds on favorite to win the mayoral election, The Nashvillian newspaper predicted the race would be a runoff between Barry and Fox, then showed Barry taking the early lead in the runoff over Fox. The runoff was noted by many as a particularly dirty campaign, with both candidates launching various personal attacks against the other. Barry raised US$1.1 million in political contributions during her campaign. She received US$1,500 from Wayne T. Smith, who is the CEO of Community Health Systems; US$1,500 from R. Milton Johnson, who is the CEO of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA); US$5,000 from HCA; US$1,500 from Damon T. Hininger, the CEO of Corrections Corporation of America (CCA); and US$1,500 from CCA's Chairman, John D. Ferguson. Another notable donor was Mike Curb, the founder of Curb Records. She received US$7,600 from the Nashville Business Coalition, a business organization. Barry defeated Fox in a September 10 runoff election. =Mayor of Nashville= Barry took office on September 25, 2015, becoming the first woman to hold the post and the second woman to serve as mayor of one of the \\"Big Four\\" cities in Tennessee. Her inauguration was held in the Music City Center in Nashville. The theme was \\"We Make Nashville\\". At the beginning of her administration, Barry promoted diversity in Nashville's government – she appointed a Chief Diversity Officer to review and oversee policies as they related to diversity in hiring and promotions within Metro Government. Barry also focused on engaging the community in governing with the Mayor's Office of Neighborhoods and Community Engagement, which includes the Office of New Americans, focused on outreach to immigrant and refugee communities. Barry started her tenure working aggressively—through a Three-Year Action Agenda—to tackle Nashville's traffic problems by upgrading and synchronizing traffic signals in a way that reduced congestion on the city's major pikes and corridors, reducing average travel delays by 24% and cutting gas consumption by an estimated 830,000 gallons in the first year alone. Barry used the concept of Vision Zero to reduce traffic-related fatalities in Davidson County by investing in paving, sidewalks, and bike paths. She also worked to improve dangerous intersections in high-traffic areas and sought out quick-build projects to promote better safety. In early 2017, she worked with Governor Bill Haslam and the Tennessee General Assembly to promote and pass the IMPROVE Act, which will increase funding for roadway projects across Tennessee and give voters the chance to create sustainable funding mechanisms for mass transit. Barry announced she would seek to place a referendum on the ballot in 2018 that would create a comprehensive mass transit system throughout all corners of Davidson County. Barry also spent two years improving the state of affordable housing in Nashville. She committed to putting $10 million in her recommended operating budget every year for the Barnes Trust Fund for Affordable Housing, a fund she helped create as a Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County member. She also created the Housing Incentive Pilot Program in April 2017 to encourage mixed-income residential development, established private-public partnerships for affordable and workforce housing on Metro-owned property, and announced her intention to utilize $25 million in general obligation bonds to preserve existing affordable housing or construct new Metro-owned developments. One of Barry's accomplishments was the creation and expansion of the Opportunity NOW program, which aimed to reduce the rising rates of youth violence and unemployment by creating 10,000 paid job and internship opportunities for Nashville's teenagers and young adults throughout the private, public and non- profit sectors. In May 2017, Barry was criticized by Black Lives Matter for her handling of the shooting of Jocques Clemmons - protesters marched through the Hillsboro neighborhood where she lives and left a coffin outside her house. In May 2017, Barry also announced the opening of an Ikea store in Nashville, scheduled for 2020, which was subsequently cancelled. On August 29, 2017, Barry dismissed the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood's anti- LGBT Nashville Statement as \\"poorly named\\" and unrepresentative of the inclusivity of Nashville and its citizens; in response, she promoted the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee's Nashville Unites Resolution. Gun violence for young Nashvillians went up during her tenure, rising up to 21 deaths in January–October 2017. The Tennessean noted that 2017 was \\"the bloodiest year for teens and children in more than a decade,\\" many of whom were African Americans who lived in city-run housing projects like the James A. Cayce Homes. In response, Barry vowed to \\"get illegal guns off of our streets and out of the hands of kids and dangerous criminals\\" and offer more job training for local youths. In October 2017, Barry unveiled her $5.2 billion plans for expanding Nashville's transportation infrastructure including the addition of light rail service. In December 2017, Barry dedicated the first historical marker in Tennessee to honor an LGBT activist, Penny Campbell, in East Nashville. Theft charges, plea bargain, and resignation On March 6, 2018, following weeks of news coverage and speculation regarding her future, Barry pleaded guilty to a Class C felony in Nashville criminal court as part of a plea bargain. Moments after her guilty plea, Barry resigned as mayor. Her successor was David Briley, who had served as vice mayor. Personal life Barry is married to Bruce Barry, a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management and a contributor to the Nashville Scene. The couple had one son, Max. On July 30, 2017, the Mayor's office announced that her child had died of an apparent drug overdose in Denver, Colorado at 22 years old.  Extramarital affair and felony charges  On January 31, 2018, Barry admitted that she had conducted a two-year long extramarital affair with Nashville Police Sergeant Robert Forrest Jr., the married officer in charge of her security detail, which included extended business trips with just the two of them. Additionally, Forrest and Barry attended various events and activities which included late- night concerts and yoga classes, during which Forrest racked up hundreds of overtime hours. A subsequent report from the Metro Auditor showed that all but 13 overtime hours and all travel expenditures were independently verified as within Metro policies. Barry maintained that Forrest was not her direct subordinate, and said that she did not want to \\"muddy the #metoo movement.\\" Forrest, two weeks prior to Barry's announcement, filed for retirement from his post as supervisor of mayoral security effective on January 31, the same day Barry admitted to the affair, thus ending his 31-year career with the Nashville Police Department. In March 2018, Barry entered into a plea agreement that required her resignation. On February 23, 2018, Forrest's wife of nearly 30 years, Penny, filed for divorce on grounds of \\"inappropriate marital conduct\\" soon after the extramarital affair came to light. Forrest and Barry, both of whom had no criminal record prior to the affair, pleaded guilty to felony theft. As part of the plea deal, they were ordered to pay restitution ($11,000 for Barry and $45,000 for Forrest) to the city and complete three years of probation. Both Forrest and Barry can petition to have their convictions wiped off their record if they successfully complete their probation. As of August 2018, Barry and her husband remain married and have continued to attend events together.  Electoral history  Barry also ran in the August 2007 Nashville Council at-large election, but those returns are not available from the Davidson County Election Commission. In 2007, Barry won her first term to the Council as an at-large councilwoman.

In reaction to a perceived lack of coverage of black art, Davis became an advocate for black art and artists. His best-known work is the Eye on '84 mural he painted to commemorate the 1984 Summer Olympics. Personal life Davis grew up near Tuskegee University where his father was a professor of psychology. Davis's family moved from Tuskegee, Alabama to Los Angeles, California in 1955 where he was exposed to Asian art. Davis became a practitioner of Zen meditation although he did not convert to Buddhism. Davis, then an art student at Pepperdine, disagreed with the overwhelmingly white focus of his coursework and sought to understand the black art scene in America. He and his brother Dale, also an artist, traveled across the country to meet other black artists including the \\"Spiral Group\\" in Harlem led by Romare Bearden and Hale Woodruff. Brockman Gallery The Davis brothers got the idea for opening the Brockman Gallery during the drive back to Southern California from the 1966 Meredith March in Jackson, Mississippi. They opened the Brockman Gallery in 1967 on Degnan Avenue in Leimert Park. The name \\"Brockman\\" refers to Alonzo and Dale's maternal grandmother's maiden name. Brockman Gallery has featured the works of Romare Bearden, John Biggers, Elizabeth Catlett, Dan Concholar, Melvin Edwards, David Hammons, John Outterbridge, and Charles White. In 1973 the brothers also founded a non- profit organization called Brockman Productions to support art in the African- American community. Teaching career Alonzo taught at Crenshaw High School until 1970 when he left to teach at series of schools including Manual Arts High School, Mount Saint Antonio College, Pasadena City College, and UCLA. Davis participated in Ruth G. Waddy's \\"Art West Associated\\" movement to agitate for the inclusion of black art in the mainstream museums of Los Angeles. In 1976 Davis started working at Brockman Gallery full-time. From 1991 to 1992, Davis taught at the San Antonio Art Institute. He then served as dean of the Memphis College of Art from 1993 to 2002. Davis, an alum of the Virginia Center for the Creative Arts, has a fellowship offered there in his name for writers, composers, and artists of African or Latino ethnicity. Art Davis painted a mural, Eye on '84, one of the ten murals commissioned under Los Angeles' 1984 Olympic Murals project. Davis's mural was located on the southbound I-110 at the Third Street on-ramp across from Judy Baca's Hitting the Wall. His mural, acrylic on concrete, depicted a series of internationally recognizable symbols including the Olympic Rings. The mural suffered weathering and was considered unrecoverable. The mural was painted over in 2001 by CalTrans. Davis moved to Sacramento in 1987 and to a residency in Hawaii in 1988.

Its images range from postcard-sized works to photomurals and billboard reproductions and are derived from appropriated lynching souvenir cards and archival sources, from which Gonzales-Day digitally removed the victim and rope (e.g., The Wonder Gaze (St. James Park), 2006–17). Critics suggest that the erasure crucially recalibrates the power of each image, redirecting scrutiny away from death to the spectacle, social dynamics, and relish of the perpetrators (often jeering and smiling disconcertingly); New York Times critic Holland Cotter notes that this shift also \\"makes hard lines between then and now, them and us, difficult to draw.\\" The erasures additionally serve as a metaphor for the expunging of the victims from history and prevent their re-victimization through re-presentation.

Her work has been exhibited around the world, including museums and galleries in Germany, Greece, and Tokyo. Her work was included in the 2004 Whitney Biennial and 2008 California Biennial. She is on the graduate faculty at Otis College of Art and Design.  Early life and education  Andrea was born in Wilmington, Ohio, and grew up in \\"an apolitical Republican family.\\" She holds an MFA degree from California Institute of the Arts. She also holds a BFA degree from Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio.  Work  As a feminist and social activist, Bowers' work addresses contemporary political issues such as immigration, environmental activism, and rape, within the larger context of American history and protest movements. Bowers regularly invites people who have a stake in the issues that concern her to enter the gallery spaces where she exhibits and directly engage with art world regulars. Examples of this include a series of activist events that took place at Susanne Vielmetter, and her decision to link the opening reception for her show \\"Mercy Mercy Me\\" (2009) at Andrew Kreps with an international day of action proposed by climate activist organization 350.org. Bowers also continues to make a series of drawings based on photos of women taken at immigrant rights marches, feminist rallies, gay rights protests, and environmental activism in which the subjects are rendered in isolation on large sheets of otherwise blank paper. In Girlfriends (May Day March, Los Angeles, 2011) a feeling of isolation and vulnerability due to the subjects being out of context is particularly strong. = Vieja Gloria = Vieja Gloria (2003) describes the clash between activist John Quigley and Los Angeles County authorities over the proposed removal of \\"Old Glory,\\" a 400-year-old oak located in Valencia, California. Quigley later convinced Bowers to undergo training in tree climbing and occupation, which she documented in the video Nonviolent Civil Disobedience Training-Tree Sitting Forest Defense (2009). In 2011 she took part in a tree sit in Arcadia, which she also documented. = Sanctuary = Sanctuary (2007) is a film that comments on the ways marginalized people create spaces of refuge against overwhelming cultural and political forces. The silent film features Elvira Arellano, an undocumented immigrant who sought refuge in Chicago's Adalberto United Methodist Church. (Arellano and her eight-year-old son were eventually arrested and deported just three weeks after Bowers met with her). = Circle = Circle (2009) is a video that depicts four generations of women from the Native Alaskan Gwich’in people speak about their ambivalent relationship with other, non-local, activists against oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Shots of a vast Arctic landscape suggest that petty differences may mean little in the context of the immensity that unites them. Bowers' focus on individual voices humanizes what might otherwise read as petty squabbling in the face of enormous challenges. = The United States v. Tim DeChristopher = In this video (2010) Bowers depicts environmental activist Tim DeChristopher speaking on camera about his sabotage of a 2008 government auction that was to make 150,000 acres of untouched Utah land available for oil and gas drilling. His account of deliberately fraudulent bidding is intercut with panoramic footage of the territory that was up for grabs; in each sequence, a tiny speck in the distance grows until the viewer can see that it is Bowers herself, carrying a slate on which she writes that location’s parcel number. = Transformer: Display = Transformer Display for Community Fundraising (2011) was created in collaboration with artist Olga Koumoundouros. Initially staged in Los Angeles, it consisted of a bricolage- based transient sculpture designed to raise money for and disseminate information about local activist organizations and neighborhood-based charities. A further incarnation at Art Basel Miami Beach (2011), titled Transformer: Display of Community Information And Activation, took the form of a cluster of activist kiosks and a replica of the semi-legendary Miami homeless camp Umoja Village, which burned down mysteriously in 2007 after the city’s efforts to remove it via legal means proved ineffective. = #sweetjane = #sweetjane (2014) explores the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case and the social media-driven activism that brought the young men responsible to trial. At the Pitzer College Art Galleries was installed a 70-foot-long drawing of the text messages sent between the teenagers in the 48 hours after the assault on the young woman, who is known in the media and throughout the trial as Jane Doe. The Pomona College Museum of Art housed a video installation comprising appropriated media footage and billboard-size photographs of disguised Anonymous protestors at the trial. Taken together, the installations critique the events and the young men, who were depicted sympathetically by the media, and the tolerance in the United States toward sexual assault. = No Olvidado (Not Forgotten) = No Olvidado (Not Forgotten) is the title of one of Andrea Bowers’ largest and most well-known works. Covering three walls of her 2010 exhibition “The Political Landscape” at Susanne Vielmetter Los Angeles Projects, the piece consisted of a massive 10-foot-tall drawing that stretched for almost 96 feet. Against a smudgy graphite background, it portrayed the white ghost of a chain-link fence topped with coiled barbed wire, through which shone hundreds of names; each represented someone who died while trying to cross the Mexico/U.S. border. The list of names featured in the work was sourced from Border Angels, an organization that aims to protect those traveling through the Imperial Valley desert region, the mountains around San Diego County, and the border region itself. Although the format echoed that of Maya Lin’s Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the delicate materials and haunting imagery in Bowers’ piece evoked the shadowy lives of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. Like many of her works, No Olvidado served as a deliberately transient monument to the marginalized and forgotten. = Letters to an Army of Three = Bowers was alerted to a collection of letters from women seeking abortions prior to Roe v. Wade addressed to the Army of Three, a group of 3 activist women who advocated for the legalization of abortion in the United States in the decade preceding the Supreme Court decision. The Army of Three had assembled a list of doctors who would provide abortions for women in need. Bowers employed what she describes as the “power of storytelling” in the video installation, Letters to an Army of Three, in which actors read the letters aloud. The video was installed in her solo show at REDCAT. Bowers work has been credited with influencing political debates regarding reproductive rights. Though her work originated in response to the Bush Administration's position against abortion, it continued to be cited afterward. = Open Secret = Open Secret (2019) is a large-scale installation of draped printouts documenting the hundreds of men accused of sexual misconduct in the #MeToo era. The work became controversial when it was discovered that Bowers had used graphic photos of the bruised face and body of Helen Donahue, a sexual assault survivor, without Donahue's permission. Donahue was horrified to learn that images she had posted on Twitter in 2017 were being featured in an artwork that would be seen by tens of thousands of people and that reportedly had a price tag of $300,000. The offending images were removed by Art Basel and Bowers issued a formal apology.

It tells the story of a P-40 Kittyhawk squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force. It was made as a companion piece to Jungle Patrol, which concentrated on the army. The film purports: \\"This is the story of one squadron of Australian airmen whose daily job in the Western Pacific typifies the spirit of the Royal Australian Air Force.\\" Production The documentary was filmed between Jul - Aug 1944 in the North of Western New Guinea. The Melbourne Herald newspaper reported that the working title for the documentary was \\"No 13.\\" and was to be based upon the Kittyhawk's of RAAF No 13 Squadron & No. 78 Squadron. The mention of No. 13 Squadron RAAF may have been an anomaly as No. 13 Sqn flew Beaufort Bombers and none appear in the final documentary. 13 Sqn was also based in North Queensland in Cook Town in May 1944 and moved to Darwin in the Northern Territory in Aug 1944. It may have been a mis- transcription of \\"30 Squadron\\" who appear in the film but were based on Bristol Beaufighters not Kittyhawks. The scenes are not necessarily in chronological order and there is some noticeable lack of continuity in places. Footage has been edited to provide a storyline for the general public and to that end it follows closely the actual RAAF operations at that time. Crew Flying Officer Ralph Smart was a RAAF officer at the time and was escort and Director. The cameramen Bill Trerise and William Carty had just filmed \\"Jungle Patrol\\". In the film Bill Trerise can be seen loading a camera into a modified belly tank of one of the Kittyhawks. Other production crew were: * Editing: Frank Coffey * Sound: Walter C. Bird * Narrator: Wilfrid Thomas * Producer: Jack S. Allan The film was processed by Filmcraft which was the studio which had modern film processing in Australia in the late 1930s. Historical Dictionary of Australian and New Zealand Cinema, 2017 Movietone Recordings was the production company. Plot The film begins with the introduction of the Squadron Leader who is described as being from Armidale,(Armidale, New South Wales) being 23 years old and having had his wings for 4 years. The Squadron is then launched to provide \\"Top Cover\\" to landing craft transports and an allied invasion fleet as its heads towards a beach head. The Squadron are there to keep Japanese aircraft away while the invasion force lands and defeats the Japanese garrison. The Americans and Australians are then seen landing on the beach head. The landing forces include RAAF ground staff who go begin the task of clearing the former Japanese airfield and expanding the area. The RAAF ground staff can be seen conducting surveying, mine disposal and bulldozer operations. Once the airfield has been completed the squadron moves forward to their new home. At their new base the Australians go about their normal camp routine, washing, cleaning and trying to survive in the poor conditions and in the incessant rain. Beaufighters are then sent out to conducting aerial reconnaissance and gather aerial imagery of Japanese positions. Once the imagery intelligence is analysed the staff identify the highest priority targets for the squadron. Ground maintenance staff continue to prepare the fighter aircraft and load the ammunition in preparation for the next mission. The aircrew prepares their emergency supplies in case of the need to bail out. Wing Leader Les Jackson then provides orders for the squadron. The squadron scrambles to conduct a ground attack mission on a Japanese headquarters. Although all aircraft return two of the aircraft have been damaged due to anti-aircraft fire. Subject Matter The film does not provide much specific information regarding names, dates and locations. Only the \\"Wing Leader\\", (Squadron Leader) Les Jackson is specifically named. A few first names of pilots as they land and take off are mentioned \\"Jim, Wally & Curly\\". A second film using the same footage however provides names of personnel, places and dates. The film, which is online, only picks up halfway through the original film and was broadcast on Australian Channel7 Two. The film provides much of the context for \\"Island Target\\". It is known that the filming was conducted Jul-Aug 1944 through multiple sources The film is set in the wider context of the Western New Guinea campaign which began on 22 April 1944. The film is focused on a single squadron, 78 Squadron, however the aircraft are all part of 78 Wing which also included 75 Squadron and 80 Squadron. 78 Wing was part of the Australian No. 10 Operational Group RAAF. In May 1944 the Wing was based at Cyclops Airfield near Hollandia (now Jayapura), Dutch New Guinea. Australia in the war of 1939-1945, Series Three - AIR, Volume II, Air War Against Japan 1943-1945, Chapter 15. From here they covered the landing of US forces at Biak island during June before their next operation in July. The footage at the start of the film appears to cover the allied invasion of Kamiri Airfield, Noemfor Island (Numfoor Island). The Island is a small island on the north of Dutch New Guinea Western New Guinea west of Biak. The Japanese had three airfields on the island including Kamiri Airfield which is the focus of the film. The day prior to the landings 75 and 80 Squadrons relocated from Cyclops to Mokmer Airfield on Biak to cover the Noemfoor operation. 80 Squadron patrolled over Biak during the landing on Noemfoor and then extended its patrols over Noemfoor the following day but had no enemy contact. The footage of the aircraft taking off is actually from Kamiri Airfield, the airfield they are about to capture and an example of the lack of chronological continuity of the film. The Battle of Noemfoor commenced on 2nd Jul with the landing of US troops and Australian support staff from No. 62 Wing RAAF (Works) at Kamiri airstrip. The Japanese were quickly overrun in fact not a shot was fired by the Japanese who were shelled and bombed prior to the landings. Clearance and expansion of the airfield commenced by the engineers later that day. By the afternoon of the 6th July the first aircraft from the Wing had arrived at the airstrip Wing Operations Officer Les Jackson. This appears to be the 78 Wings Headquarters element stepping up to establish the Wings Headquarters presence on the island. The film depicts other Kittyhawk arriving as being the first, but are other elements of 78 Squadron arriving on 20 July, the ground staff had arrived two days earlier. The remainder of the Wing arrived from Biak on the 22 July. The next portion of the film is dedicated to everyday scenes at the camp. The camp is a collection of tents and demonstrates the rapid movement of the unit as the only semi- permanent structures seen are an air tower and large shed. In fact by July 1944 78 Squadron had moved six times in nine months. The film covers reconnaissance by RAAF Beaufighters from 30 Squadron who locate and conduct aerial reconnaissance of the Japanese's positions. The film also captures an unknown downed allied pilot who is making his way down a river in an inflatable boat using a triangle to signal the aircraft his location. 30 Squadron were flying from Tadji Airfield (now Tadji Airport) near Aitape and did not arrive at Kamiri Airfield until 2 August 1944. On return the aerial photography film is developed for analysis. This is then used by HQ No. 10 Operational Group led by Air Commodore Harry Cobby and the Officer Commanding 78 Wing Group Captain W. D. Brookes to develop the plan for the Wing to target these positions. Harry Cobby did not arrive until early Aug and had replaced Air Commodore Scherger who had been injured in a jeep accident. The final portion of the film the Wing is briefed by the 78 Wing Operations Officer, Squadron Leader Les Jackson on 29 Jul 44. The briefing is for a Wing attack on Sasapore to harass enemy defences and sink supply craft. The attack is to supporting the US Army landing at the Battle of Sansapor on 30 July. The Wing departs and the footage captures strafing runs and fuel canister drops over the Japanese targets. All aircraft return successfully to Kamiri Airfield. The film implies that two aircraft were badly damaged however the aircraft shown were in fact involved in accidents. The first Kittyhawk lands with its port side wing partially destroyed which is attributed to the \\"Woodpeckers\\" aka Japanese Anti Aircraft fire. The damage was actually caused by a mid-air collision when callsign \\"Yellow 3\\" collided with his and another plane. The second Kittyhawk, was damaged while taking off in formation where it struck the propeller of RAAF Hudson on the right hand side of the strip, removing and damaging two foot of the Kitthawk's starboard wing. The pilot, Flight Sergeant Roy John Sheppard was not injured and the aircraft was passed to 22 Repair and Salvage Unit (RSU) on 06 Aug 1944 for repair. http://www.adf-serials.com.au ADF-SERIALS, Australian & New Zealand Military Aircraft Serials & History.

Writing in a 2004 Jerusalem Post article he said, \\"HRW's press statement exposes it as a biased political organization hiding behind the rhetoric of human rights.\\" Later he accused HRW of \\"exploiting the rhetoric of human rights to delegitimize Israel\\". Human Rights Watch accused Steinberg of \\"sleight of hand\\" in his reporting of its activities, and of ignoring its condemnations of Palestinian militant actions. In 2014, former Associated Press journalist Matti Friedman said that AP reporters had been banned from interviewing Steinberg and NGO Monitor. The AP denied the claim. = Court case = In January 2010, after the European Commission refused to release documents on NGO funding, Steinberg initiated legal action under the EU's Freedom of Information statutes. The court ruled that instability in the Middle East and the prospect that \\"such information may pose a danger to human rights groups\\" justified the refusal. The court further found that Steinberg's petition was \\"manifestly lacking any foundation in law.\\" Commenting on Steinberg's failed legal action, Israeli attorney Michael Sfard commented that \\"Steinberg invents demons and then chases them.

Hooligans and the F-Side. The massive fight between the two groups took place on 23 March 1997 along the A9 motorway near Beverwijk, from which its name is derived.  Prelude  The intent of the meeting between the two groups was a revanche, after the previously short and especially disappointing fight for the Ajax hooligans F-Side which had previously taken place along the A10 motorway. In the previous incident, both groups were to arrive with 50 hooligans each, ready for combat. The Feyenoord hooligans S.C.F., however, arrived with 75. The F-Side group were forced to escape, since they had actually arrived with 50 fighters as previously agreed upon between the two groups. The S.C.F. didn't hold their promise, as other occasions showed that the F-side group often did the same to other groups. On the date of the event, Ajax and Feyenoord were scheduled to play in Waalwijk and Alkmaar and the police were made aware that both supporter groups were going to clash on said date, but they did not know at which location. A platoon of police mobile units was deployed to the Beverwijkse Bazaar nonetheless, to protect the crowd from a potential hazard. The confrontation Due to road construction, the two hooligan groups of both clubs (each a few hundred men strong) met in a meadow near the motorway, armed with knives, baseball bats, iron bars, electroshock weapons and claw hammers, along with other armaments; the groups went into combat in an unprecedented fashion. The Feyenoord hooligans kept the upper-hand, trapped the Ajax hooligans along the motorway while attacking from both sides. The remaining Ajax hooligans were forced to fight or run for their lives. When the police arrived on the scene, they were very surprised by the speed and intensity of the fighting. The Police had arrived so late that no arrests were actually made, but several weapons were seized from both parties involved. Voetbalrellen Feyenoord- en Ajaxaanhangers bij Beverwijk, nieuwsdossier.nl The death of Carlo Picornie and the aftermath During the scuffle, one of the Ajax hooligans, Carlo Picornie, was killed. He was one of the more long- term members within the hard core of the F-Side. He died due to 3 knife stabs which filled his lungs.https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/feyenoord- fan-krijgt-vier-jaar-om-dood- picornie~b81ee7be/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bing.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dpicornie%2Bdoodsoorzaak%26form%3DEDGTCT%26qs%3DPF%26cvid%3D923da1b8ea45409290b62a862d2aa360%26refig%3D26898ca2054a4af2c6fd5c1e69b51dae%26cc%3DNL%26setlang%3Den- GB One member of S.C.F. was convicted due to Carlo Picornie's death, namely 21-year-old Leonardo Pansier, Hoofddader ‘Beverwijk’ in skybox de Kuip, Andreas Kouwenhoven, NRC Handelsblad, 22 March 2017 who was given an unconditional prison sentence of 5-years. During the procedure, following the murder of Carlo Picornie, Leonardo Pansier was also found guilty of attempted murder on H. Joos, another Ajax hooligan. Joos was also present in the violent attack in Beverwijk and was seriously injured here as well. Feyenoord hooligan Marco P. and 25-year-old hooligan Daniël C. were sentenced to four years in prison. Daniël C. was convicted because he stabbed H. Joos with a knife, and likely was involved in the death of Carlo Picornie. Charged with attempted murder, Marco P. was also charged with the same sentence for his involvement in the murder of Carlo Picornie. Feyenoord hooligan Vincent M. was also convicted in the abuse of H. Joos, having beaten him with a bat. Although he claimed to have not hit hard with the bat, he too was convicted of attempted murder, as well as having raised suspicion regarding his involvement with the murder of Carlo Picornie. Leonardo Pansier was the only participant to have continuously denied involvement in the murder of Picornie. In 2009, Leonardo Pansier was invited as a guest on the TV show Sophie op 3 of BNN where he revealed that he felt betrayed by members of his own hooligan group. The stories that made the rounds regarding several people who were involved in those incidents during the court process failed to include those who executed the final blow. Claiming that those who actually killed him were never caught. But the fact of the matter is that more Feyenoord hooligans made accusative recounts towards Leonardo Pansier in their statements, which ultimately lead to the conviction of Leonardo Pansier in the case. Multiple witnesses at the scene had reported to have seen Leonardo enraged with a bicycle lock beating on Carlo's head. Furthermore, the videotape of the A9 motorway security cameras had captured the act on camera. However the footage from the camera was deemed as insufficient because it was of poor quality and did not capture a lot of what had actually happened along the motorway. Alleged scheme Carlo Picornie was born 15 October 1961 and due to his age was no longer considered an active member of the hard core of the F-Side. But Picornie wanted to set an example for the young emerging hooligans at Ajax and attended the Battle in Beverwijk. During the fight, Picornie was separated from his group, along with H. Joos with both Ajax hooligans being surrounded by Feyenoord Hooligans, leading to their injuries and Carlo's death on the scene. Following the funeral of Picornie, in which Ajax chairman Michael van Praag was in attendance, unrest began amongst the F-Side hooligans. The Ajax hooligans started to blame each other for Picornie's death, claiming that not enough was done to protect his life. It was also not being considered an accident that alone \\"Picornie\\" was targeted and coincidentally murdered. Picornie had been an icon for Ajax hooligans for years, an old member with a violent reputation amongst the F-Side. Prior to his death Picornie was known to never avoid a confrontation. It was believed that the Feyenoord hooligans were looking to send a message to the Ajax hooligans group by murdering Picornie. During the TV show \\"De Harde Kern\\" from 1998 with host Bas van Hout, which focused on the hooligan groups of the biggest clubs of the Netherlands, Bas van Hout interviewed two masked members of the Feyenoord hooligan group who offered some information over the events that occurred in Beverwijk. According to one of these hooligans, it could not just as easily been a different hooligan than Picornie. That due to the circumstances Picornie had been singled out by the Feyenoord hooligans due to his reputation as an Ajax hooligan. Given the manner in which he was killed, probably at the hand of more than one person, his murder was largely considered intentional, and that the Feyenoord hooligans had singled out Picornie (considering the reputation of the fighter) to consciously send a message to the hooligans of Ajax. But whether it was known from the Feyenoord group that Picornie would be in attendance, or whether they had singled him out remains unknown. It is also said that Picornie simply had bad luck to encounter a bunch of Feyenoord hooligans who were under the influence of drugs and alcohol who simply beat him to death. During the broadcast of \\"De harde kern\\", the Feyenoord hooligans had revealed to Bas van Hout that a certain hierarchy was present within the hooligan groups which was comparable to that of a criminal organization. Those who stood accused by the Public prosecution were later wiped from the table by a Judge, because there was no substantial evidence delivered. Even though the meeting and intention had been declared as premeditated, with an example of both hooligan groups being delivered due to their previous encounter along A10. It is also noteworthy that although the police were present during the incident, that very little police intervention was done. Weapons were simply confiscated and people were being searched for weapons to prove whether or not they were participants in the incident instead. Nobody at the time of the event was held accountable or arrested. It was said that the police was possibly scared that arrests would lead to more violence. Later when more clarity regarding the incident had come to light, it became clear that some arrests actually had been made. A few days prior to the battle of Beverwijk, Ajax hooligans had been called \\"pussies\\" by ex-Feyenoord hooligan Daniël C. As Daniël was being interviewed by a journalist of NOS after a short altercation along the A10 motorway. Later Ajax hooligans were made the laughing stock on camera, by Feyenoord hooligan Gijs van D. through a banner in De Kuip which read: \\"A'dam lopen altijd weg, A10, mietjes\\" (English: \\"A'dam always run away, A10 pussies\\"). Events such as this one along with other incidents are also regarded as contributing factors in the battle of Beverwijk, for which Carlo Picornie paid with his life. Aftermath During the broadcast of the show Sophie op 3 it became clear that the death of Picornie had caused great unrest in the S.C.F. hooligans group of Feyenoord as well. People reportedly told on each other resulting in several convictions. Noninvasive statements had been made about each other with many people lying about their involvement regarding Picornies death. The three Feyenoord hooligans who were guests on the show reported that those truly responsible for the death of Picornie could no longer live in Rotterdam, and that they themselves had already left the city, out of fear for revenge from fellow members. The only person who was eventually convicted of the murder of Picornie stated in the broadcast that: \\"His life had changed to a peaceful one due to the events he had experienced in Beverwijk, although he would remain a hooligan\\" The definite responsible for Picornies death never became clear, as Leonardo Pansier kept denying his involvement in the murder. As a so-called \\"vow of silence\\" exists amongst the hooligans group of people involved, this may never become clear. The death of Picornie lead to a lot of anxiety in the media. He had not been the first deadly victim of hooligan-club violence. In 1991 FC Twente-hooligan Eric Lassche had been beaten to death during riots. The novel \\"de Movo Tapes\\" by Dutch writer A.F.Th. van der Heijden is partially based on the Battle of Beverwijk.

Career =Juniors= After having curled with the Mike Armstrong junior rink, Flasch joined the Braeden Moskowy rink at second position in 2010. The team won the Saskatchewan Junior championships that year, earning the rink the right to represent Saskatchewan at the 2011 Canadian Junior Curling Championships. At the Canadian Juniors, the team- which also included Kirk Muyres and Matt Lang- went undefeated (12-0) through the round robin, and proceeded to win the event by defeating Ontario's Mathew Camm in the final. The team would go on to represent Canada at the 2011 World Junior Curling Championships where they would find less success. The team found themselves in 4th place after the round robin with a 6-3 record. The team beat Norway (Steffen Mellemseter) in their first playoff match, but in the semi-final they lost to Switzerland (Peter de Cruz), and then lost to Norway again in the bronze medal game. After the World Juniors, the team played in their first Grand Slam event, the 2011 Players' Championship where they surprised many by making into the quarterfinals. After the season, Moskowy and Muyres graduated from the junior level. Lang and Flasch remained together, with Lang at skip and Flasch at second. They added Tyler Hartung and Jayden Shwaga. =Men's= Following juniors, Flasch joined the Steve Laycock rink at second, rejoining his former junior teammate, Kirk Muyres who is third on the team. Kirk's brother Dallan would play lead. In Flasch's first season with the Laycock rink, the team would play in all four Grand Slam events, making it to the semi-finals of the 2012 Masters of Curling. At the 2013 provincial men's championship, the team finished 4th. Following the season, the team had accumulated enough CTRS points to qualify for the \\"Road to the Roar\\" 2013 Canadian Olympic pre-qualifying event. At the \\"Road to the Roar\\" the following season, the team placed fourth, which was not good enough to qualify for the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. The Laycock rink would win the 2014 SaskTel Tankard men's provincial championship, sending the team to the 2014 Tim Hortons Brier, Flasch's first. At the Brier, the team narrowly missed the playoffs, after finishing the round robin with a 6-5 record. In the 2014-15 curling season, the team had their best year yet finishing the season 4th on the World Curling Tour's money list. The team qualified in the first three Grand Slams with a runner up finish to Team Gushue at the 2014 Canadian Open of Curling. The Laycock team repeated as Saskatchewan champions, and would represent Saskatchewan at the 2015 Tim Hortons Brier. There, they finished the round robin with an 8-4 record finishing 3rd in the round robin. They would lose the 3 vs. 4 game to Team Canada, but would go on to win the bronze medal. They Laycock rink won the 2016 SaskTel Tankard and represented Saskatchewan at the 2016 Tim Hortons Brier. There, they finished out of the playoffs with a 5-6 record. After the team lost in the final of the 2017 SaskTel Tankard, Flasch announced he was leaving the Laycock rink. For the 2017-18 curling season, Flasch formed a new team of Kevin Marsh, Daniel Marsh and Trent Knapp, with Flasch skipping the team. His new team would win one tour event, the 2017 College Clean Restoration Curling Classic. This qualified them for the season-ending 2018 Humpty's Champions Cup, their lone slam of the season, where they would lose in a tiebreaker. The team played in the 2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials, where they finished with a 2-4 record, missing the playoffs. At the 2018 SaskTel Tankard, Flacsh led his team all the way to the finals, where he lost to his former skip, Steve Laycock. In March 2018, it was announced that Flasch would be joining the Koe rink for the 2018-19 curling season, and would play second on the team. After joining the Edmonton based team of Kevin Koe, B. J. Neufeld and Ben Hebert, his new team began the 2018-19 curling season by winning the first leg of the Curling World Cup, defeating Norway's Steffen Walstad in the final. In provincial playdowns, the Koe rink lost two of their first three games at the 2019 Boston Pizza Cup, before winning five straight games to claim the Alberta championship. The team represented Alberta at the 2019 Tim Hortons Brier, and went undefeated in the entire tournament en route to winning his first Brier title. They went on to represent Canada at the 2019 World Men's Curling Championship, finishing the round robin with a 9-3 record. They battled through the playoffs to play Team Sweden's Niklas Edin rink in the final, losing 7-2. In Grand Slam play, the team failed to win any slams, but did make it to three finals. Despite the lack of any event wins, their strong play was good enough to award them with the Pinty's Cup for the season's best Slam team. The team ended the season in the Grand Final of the Curling World Cup, where they beat the host Chinese team (Zou Qiang). At the end of the season, Team Koe ranked first on the World Curling Tour Order of Merit and Money List. This also meant they led the CTRS standings, finishing the season with 512.335 points. Team Koe started their 2019–20 season at the 2019 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic and lost in the quarterfinal to Brad Jacobs. They lost the final of the Stu Sells Toronto Tankard to the Jacobs rink as well. In Grand Slam play, they made the semifinal of the Tour Challenge and the quarterfinals of the National. They missed the playoffs at both the Masters and the Canadian Open. At the Canada Cup, they finished the round robin with a 5–1, which qualified them for the final which they lost to John Epping. At the 2020 Tim Hortons Brier they finished the championship pool with a 7–4 record, which was a four way tie for fourth. They faced Jacobs in the first round of tiebreakers where they lost 8–3 and were eliminated. It would be the team's last event of the season as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 16, 2020, Team Koe announced they would be parting ways with Flasch.

The Assembly had 48 members, and a Council of Ministers in an advisory role to the Chief Commissioner of Delhi, though it also had powers to make laws. The first Council of Ministers was led by Chaudhary Brahm Prakash, who became the first Chief Minister of Delhi. However, the States Reorganisation Commission, set up in 1953, led to the Constitutional amendment through States Reorganisation Act, 1956, which came into effect on 1 November 1956. This meant that Delhi was no longer a Part-C State and was made a Union Territory under the direct administration of the President of India. Also the Delhi Legislative Assembly and the Council of Ministers were abolished simultaneously. Subsequently, the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 was enacted which led to the formation the Municipal Corporation. Then, in September 1966, with \\"The Delhi Administration Act, 1966\\", the assembly was replaced by the Delhi Metropolitan Council with 56 elected and five nominated members with the Lt. Governor of Delhi as its head. The Council however had no legislative powers, only an advisory role in the governance of Delhi. This set up functioned until 1990. This Council was finally replaced by the Delhi Legislative Assembly through the Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991, followed by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 the Sixty-ninth Amendment to the Constitution of India, which declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as National Capital Territory of Delhi and also supplements the constitutional provisions relating to the Legislative Assembly and the Council of Ministers and related matters.THE CONSTITUTION (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 The Legislative Assembly is selected for period of five years, and presently it is the seventh assembly, which was selected through the 2020 Legislative Assembly election.  Delhi Legislative Elections  The election campaigns have played a critical role in determining the outcome of elections in Delhi. This is particularly evident in elections since 2000. Elections to the Legislative Assemblies of Delhi were held in the following years: *1951 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *1993 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *1998 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *2003 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *2008 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *2013 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *2015 Delhi Legislative Assembly election *2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election Assembly building Originally built 1912, designed by E. Montague Thomas to hold the Imperial Legislative Council and subsequently the Central Legislative Assembly (after 1919), till the newly constructed Parliament House of India in New Delhi (Sansad Bhawan) was inaugurated on 18 January 1927. The building also housed in the Secretariat of the Government of India, and was built after the capital of India shifted to Delhi from Calcutta, the temporary secretariat building was constructed in a few months' time in 1912, it functioned as the Secretariat for another decade, before the offices shifted to the present Secretariat Building on Raisina Hill.

It features a young British girl experiencing the effects of a hypothetical civil war on the streets of London. Everything depicted in the video was based on the factual accounts of children in Syria. The video's purpose is to depict the lives of children growing up surrounded by war, in order to bring attention to young people caught up in the Syrian Civil War. The video was shot over the course of two days, and combines the second-a-day and photo-a-day video formats, featuring a young girl's life as it progresses from normal to complete chaos in the course of a year.  Plot  The video features a young British girl experiencing the effects of a hypothetical civil war on the streets of London, by showing a second a day of her life for several days over the span of a year, from one birthday anniversary of hers to the next. In the opening scene, the girl is at her birthday party, with her parents and friends near her, and a cake with candles in front of her. She is asked to make a wish. Throughout the early part of advert, she continues to live an ordinary life with loving family and friends, but soon London is engulfed in war. By the end of the video, she has lost her father while running with her mother. On her next birthday, she is seen at a hospital bed and is again presented by her mum with a cake and a candle and asked to make a wish. The video ends with the line \\"Just because it isn't happening here doesn't mean it isn't happening.\\" It is revealed at the end that the video is based on true stories of what children living through the Syrian Civil War experienced, and highlights the work of Save the Children to improve the lives of children in Syria and around the world.  Reception  The ad was released on 5 March 2014. It received news coverage immediately in many UK newspapers and magazines including The Independent, Telegraph, Huffington Post (UK), Express, Metro, and The Mirror. It was also covered in international media such as Time Magazine, Adweek, Al Arabiya, and the Washington Post. The coverage in the Washington Post noted that the video would only seem shocking to people who had not experienced or read closely about the lived experiences of people who had gone through civil wars, and highlighted the newspaper's profiles of refugees from civil wars. The video acquired more than 23 million views on YouTube in less than a week. The reasons for its virality were dissected by a number of commentators, including Fairsay and The Drum. The following factors were identified: strong emotions, a video title (\\"Most Shocking Second a Day\\") that created what Upworthy has called a \\"curiosity gap\\" by providing just enough information to make people click to want to know more, and a smart initial paid promotion and publicity in the right circles. The video was also listed as the first of five highly successful nonprofit branded videos in the first quarter of 2014. In November 2014, American actor Ashton Kutcher posted an A Plus article about the video on his Facebook page (A Plus is a website co-founded by Kutcher, who is also Chairman of the Board). This resulted in 10 million page views of the video and made it the second most-viewed brand video of the week on YouTube. As of May 2019, the video has accumulated over 62 million views on YouTube. According to Don't Panic London's website, the video was featured twice on the Reddit front page, was shared 920,000 times, and caused Save the Children's YouTube channel subscriptions to increase by over 1000%.

Brushes with death Selak's brushes with death started in January 1962 when he was riding a train through a cold, rainy canyon and the train flew off the tracks and crashed in a river. Someone pulled Selak to safety, while 17 other passengers drowned. Selak suffered a broken arm and hypothermia. The next year, during his first and only plane ride, he was blown out of a malfunctioning plane door and landed in a haystack; the plane crashed, killing 19 people.PlaneCrashInfo.com listing for all crashes worldwide in 1963Bureau of Aircraft Accidents Archives search for crashes in Croatia in 1963 Aviation Safety Network search for all plane crashes in Croatia Three years after that, in 1966, a bus that he was riding in skidded off the road and into a river, drowning four passengers. Selak swam to shore with a few cuts and bruises. In 1970 his car caught fire as he was driving and he managed to escape before the fuel tank blew up. Three years later, in another driving incident, the engine of his car was doused with hot oil from a malfunctioning fuel pump, causing flames to shoot through the air vents. Selak's hair was completely singed in this incident, but he was otherwise unharmed. In 1995, he was struck by a bus in Zagreb, but sustained only minor injuries. In 1996 he eluded a head-on collision with a United Nations truck on a mountain curve by swerving into a guardrail, which gave way under the force of his car; he was ejected from the car when the door flew open, (he wasn't wearing a seatbelt) managed to hold onto a tree, and watched his car plummet down into a gorge. Lottery winner In 2003, two days after his 73rd birthday, Selak won €900000 (US$1,110,000) (£702,920) in the lottery. At the time of his win, he also married for the fifth time. While he purchased two houses and a boat with his winnings, in 2010 he decided to give most of the remaining money away to relatives and friends after deciding to live a frugal lifestyle.

The main idea of LowerUnits is to exploit the following fact:Fontaine, Pascal; Merz, Stephan; Woltzenlogel Paleo, Bruno. Compression of Propositional Resolution Proofs via Partial Regularization. 23rd International Conference on Automated Deduction, 2011. Theorem: Let \\\\varphi be a potentially redundant proof, and \\\\eta be the redundant proof  redundant node. If \\\\eta’s clause is a unit clause, then \\\\varphi is redundant. The algorithm targets exactly the class of global redundancy stemming from multiple resolutions with unit clauses. The algorithm takes its name from the fact that, when this rewriting is done and the resulting proof is displayed as a DAG (directed acyclic graph), the unit node \\\\eta appears lower (i.e., closer to the root) than it used to appear in the original proof. A naive implementation exploiting theorem would require the proof to be traversed and fixed after each unit node is lowered. It is possible, however, to do better by first collecting and removing all the unit nodes in a single traversal, and afterwards fixing the whole proof in a single second traversal. Finally, the collected and fixed unit nodes have to be reinserted at the bottom of the proof. Care must be taken with cases when a unit node \\\\eta^{\\\\prime} occurs above in the subproof that derives another unit node \\\\eta. In such cases, \\\\eta depends on \\\\eta^{\\\\prime}. Let \\\\ell be the single literal of the unit clause of \\\\eta^{\\\\prime}. Then any occurrence of \\\\overline{\\\\ell} in the subproof above \\\\eta will not be cancelled by resolution inferences with \\\\eta^{\\\\prime} anymore. Consequently, \\\\overline{\\\\ell} will be propagated downwards when the proof is fixed and will appear in the clause of \\\\eta. Difficulties with such dependencies can be easily avoided if we reinsert the upper unit node \\\\eta^{\\\\prime} after reinserting the unit node \\\\eta (i.e. after reinsertion, \\\\eta^{\\\\prime} must appear below \\\\eta, to cancel the extra literal \\\\overline{\\\\ell} from \\\\eta’s clause). This can be ensured by collecting the unit nodes in a queue during a bottom-up traversal of the proof and reinserting them in the order they were queued. The algorithm for fixing a proof containing many roots performs a top-down traversal of the proof, recomputing the resolvents and replacing broken nodes (e.g. nodes having deletedNodeMarker as one of their parents) by their surviving parents (e.g. the other parent, in case one parent was deletedNodeMarker). When unit nodes are collected and removed from a proof of a clause \\\\kappa and the proof is fixed, the clause \\\\kappa^{\\\\prime} in the root node of the new proof is not equal to \\\\kappa anymore, but contains (some of) the duals of the literals of the unit clauses that have been removed from the proof. The reinsertion of unit nodes at the bottom of the proof resolves \\\\kappa^{\\\\prime} with the clauses of (some of) the collected unit nodes, in order to obtain a proof of \\\\kappa again.  Algorithm  General structure of the algorithm Input: A proof \\\\psi Output: A proof \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} with no global redundancy with unit redundant node (unitsQueue, \\\\psi_{b}) ← collectUnits(\\\\psi); \\\\psi_{f} ← fix(\\\\psi_{b}); fixedUnitsQueue ← fix(unitsQueue); \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} ← reinsertUnits(\\\\psi_{f}, fixedUnitsQueue); return \\\\psi^{\\\\prime}; We collect the unit clauses as follow Input: A proof \\\\psi Output: A pair containing a queue of all unit nodes (unitsQueue) that are used more than once in \\\\psi and a broken proof \\\\psi_{b} \\\\psi_{b} ← \\\\psi; traverse \\\\psi_{b} bottom-up and foreach node \\\\eta in \\\\psi_{b} do if \\\\eta is unit and \\\\eta has more than one child then add \\\\eta to unitsQueue; remove \\\\eta from \\\\psi_{b}; end end return (unitsQueue, \\\\psi_{b}); Then we reinsert the units Input: A proof \\\\psi_{f} (with a single root) and a queue q of root nodes Output: A proof \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} ← \\\\psi_{f}; while q eq\\\\emptyset do \\\\eta ← first element of q; q ← tail of q; if \\\\eta is resolvable with root of \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} then \\\\psi^{\\\\prime} ← resolvent of \\\\eta with the root of \\\\psi^{\\\\prime}; end end return \\\\psi^{\\\\prime};  Notes  Category:Automated theorem proving Category:Proof theory ","title":"LowerUnits"},{"id":"42158375","text":"Clonloghan ( ) is a civil parish of County Clare, Ireland, located by road northwest of Limerick, just north of Shannon.

He was the first professional wheelchair skater in Germany. Apart from riding WCMX, which is adapted from skateboarding and BMX, he also hosts WCMX workshops for other wheelchair users in Germany. At the age of 21, he became paralysed from the waist down (L3) after he fell into stairwell. Early life and education Lebuser grew up in Frankfurt (Oder) in Brandenburg, Germany. After primary education, he went to a sports school in Frankfurt (Oder) and graduated from a secondary school in 2003. He worked as a painter and later attended sixth form. Before moving to Berlin in 2010, he worked as a customer consultant. He did several internships since, including in Helsinki, Finland. Accident and rehabilitation On 28 August 2008, Lebuser broke his back after falling into a stairwell, two floors down. He tried to slide down a handrail after a friend's birthday. He has a spinal cord injury from the waist down (first lumbar vertebra fracture). During his time at the hospital and his rehabilitation the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing took place, so he soon realised that there was more to do than getting pushed around in a chair. While still in hospital a friend showed Lebuser a YouTube video of Aaron Fotheringham doing a wheelchair backflip, which inspired him to go to skate parks and start wheelchair skating. He also started playing wheelchair basketball soon after rehabilitation. Professional life Since 2012, Lebuser competes in the WCMX World Championships, also known as Life Rolls On \\"They Will Skate Again\\" in Venice, California every year. In 2013, he placed third in the WCMX division and fifth in all divisions. In 2012, he placed fifth. 2014 he won the category \\"Best Overall Run\\" in the wheelchair section. In 2013, Lebuser started hosting WCMX workshops for other wheelchair users across Germany. There were no other wheelchair skaters in Germany apart from him before. He also created an action sports division at the German Wheelchair Sports Association (DRS). Lebuser uses a customised WCMX chair from Jumper Equipamentos from Brazil for skating. The chair features four-wheel suspension and is more solid than everyday wheelchairs. This enables him to perform the same sorts of tricks that skateboarders and BMXers can do, as the suspension cushions his landings.

After a year and a half of fighting, the Hayato were defeated, and the Imperial court established its rule over southern Kyushu.  Background  In the latter half of the 7th century, the Yamato court's influence extended to southern Kyushu, but the scattered Kumaso and Hayato populations held their ground. The court was attempting to introduce its own Ritsuryō system throughout its sphere of influence, but the populations of southern Kyushu resisted. This was because Ritsuryō was based on rice cultivation, to which the volcanic soil of southern Kyushu was unsuited. On the other hand, the court was also expanding its intercourse with mainland China through the Ryukyu Islands. It organized an investigative expedition called the to survey southern Kyushu and the Ryukyu Islands, but in 700 the bekkokushi were threatened by the local inhabitants in various parts of southern Kyushu. The court gathered weapons in Dazaifu, and in 702 dispatched troops to southern Kyushu. At the same time, they established the future Satsuma Province there and strengthened the local governmental structure. In 713, Ōsumi Province was established, and 5,000 inhabitants of Buzen Province, where Ritsuryō had already been implemented, were sent to live there and guide the further adoption of Ritsuryō. Tensions rose as the court continued to press Ritsuryō, and especially the Handen-Shūju system, on the Hayato population, who practiced communal land use.  Rebellion  Early in the year 720, the imperial court received notice from Dazaifu that , the governor of Ōsumi Province, had been killed. Within a week, the court appointed Ōtomo no Tabito as , with and as his vice-generals, and sent them to war. The Hayato side gathered several thousand troops and holed up in seven castles. In response, the court gathered over ten thousand troops from the various regions of Kyushu and divided them into a two-pronged attack, advancing from the east and the west. Three months after the attack was launched, they reported the defeat of five of the castles. However, they met with unexpected difficulty at the remaining two fortresses, and . The war drew on, and after another two months, Ōtomo returned to the capital, leaving his vice-generals in charge. After almost a year and a half of fighting, the war ended in the Hayatos' defeat. In mid-721, the vice-generals returned to the capital with Hayato prisoners of war. Between those killed and taken prisoner, the Shoku Nihongi records Hayato casualties totaling 1,400 people. Due to the rebellion, the enforcement of Handen-Shūju was postponed. It was finally implemented in 800, almost eighty years after the war. The population of the Yamato in Kyushu increased. The Hayato eventually assimilated into Japanese society and many of them also moved to the main island of Honshū, especially the Kinai region, where they were active in the protection of the court, the arts, sumo, and bamboo work.The Nihon Shoki records that in the court of Emperor Tenmu, in the late 7th century, the Hayato performed sumo in the court, but it is not described as different from the sumo of the Yamato themselves. In 682, the Ōsumi Hayato and Ata Hayato competed in sumo and the Ōsumi side won, and in 695 a bout of sumo between Hayato on the grounds of Asuka-dera drew a crowd of spectators. Many lived in Yamashiro Province, in the south of modern Kyoto. There remains an area called in Kyōtanabe, Kyoto, where many Ōsumi Hayato lived. These were the Hayato governed by the Hayato- shi, appointed by the Imperial dynasty.

While not a soldier by training, he was said to be capable and respected as the overseer of the armies of the realm.  Background  Sang Weihan was born in 898, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. He was from the Tang Dynasty eastern capital Luoyang — as his father Sang Gong () was a \\"guest general\\" (客將, kejiang) under Zhang Quanyi, the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., the Luoyang region). (The fact that Sang Gong was described as a \\"guest general\\" suggests that Sang Gong himself was not from Luoyang or vicinity, but later joined Zhang's army after first having served under another warlord.) Sang Weihan was said to have an unusual, repulsive appearance — short in stature, with a very long face. However, it was said that he considered his appearance to be a reason to have great ambition. When he submitted himself for imperial examinations, however, the chief examiners initially did not want to pass him, because they disliked his surname Sang (a homophone of 喪, \\"funeral\\"). When others, hearing of this, tried to dissuade him from submitting for the imperial examinations, he was lamenting and yet not discouraged, and wrote a poem entitled, \\"Ode to the Sun Rising from Fusang\\" to declare his ambition.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 29. He eventually passed the imperial examinations during the Tongguang era (923-926) of Later Tang's emperor Li Cunxu.  Service under Shi Jingtang during Later Tang  During the subsequent reign of Li Cunxu's adoptive brother and successor Li Siyuan, Li Siyuan's son-in-law Shi Jingtang served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). He invited Sang Weihan to serve as his secretary in charge of communications.Shi Jingtang served as military governor of Heyang from 931 to 932, so Sang must have become his staff member during that time. See Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 75, Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. When Shi was subsequently transferred to Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) in 932,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278. Sang followed him to Hedong. In 936, then- emperor Li Congke (Li Siyuan's adoptive son), suspicious of Shi, issued an edict transferring Shi to Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong). Shi, fearful of the consequences, convened his chief staff members to discuss how to react to it. Most of them advised that he resist the order. However, it was Sang who pointed out that Li Congke, as an adoptive son of Li Siyuan's, lacked legitimacy and popular support, and that if Shi had the support of Later Tang's northern rival Khitan Empire, he had chance to overthrow Li Congke. Shi thus resolved to rebel against Later Tang. He had Sang draft for him a petition to Khitan's Emperor Taizong, offering, in exchange for military support, to submit as subject and son, as well as cede Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing) as well as other Later Tang territory north of the Yanmen Pass to the Khitan, despite the misgivings of the general Liu Zhiyuan. Shi's offer enticed Emperor Taizong, and he agreed to launch troops.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 280. The Later Tang general Zhang Jingda soon put Hedong's capital Taiyuan under siege, but was unable to capture it quickly. Emperor Taizong then arrived with Khitan troops, and the joint Khitan/Hedong troops crushed Zhang's troops and then put the remnants of his army under siege at Jin'an Base (晉安寨, near Taiyuan). Meanwhile, Emperor Taizong declared Shi the emperor of China (as the emperor of a new state of Later Jin).  During Later Jin  = During Shi Jingtang's reign =  During Shi's takeover of Later Tang territory  Upon Emperor Taizong's declaration of him as emperor, Shi Jingtang formed his imperial government. He made Sang Weihan imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) and deputy minister of rites (禮部侍郎, Libu Shilang), acting as chief of staff. However, despite the Khitan/Hedong victory over Zhang Jingda, the remnants of Zhang's army held out at Jin'an for some time, and a relief army under the command of the Later Tang general Zhao Dejun was approaching, causing apprehensions in Emperor Taizong's mind. Zhao, however, was disloyal to Later Tang, and made secret overtures to Emperor Taizong that if Emperor Taizong supported him to be emperor of China instead, he would ally with the Khitan to destroy Later Tang and further promise that Shi could retain Hedong. Emperor Taizong was enticed. When Shi heard this, he became fearful, and he sent Sang to the Khitan camp to dissuade Emperor Taizong. Sang pointed out that Shi would serve Khitan interests loyally as emperor of China and that the treacherous Zhao could not be trusted. He also knelt in front of Emperor Taizong's tent for an entire day, pleading his case. Emperor Taizong was touched, and responded to Zhao's emissary, pointing to a rock, \\"I have already made my promise to Master Shi. Only if this rock rots would I change my mind.\\" He also stated to Shi, \\"Sang Weihan is faithful to you. He should be chancellor.\\" Meanwhile, with no army coming to its aid, Zhang's army fell into desperate shape at Jin'an. Zhang's deputy Yang Guangyuan assassinated him and surrendered the army to the combined Khitan/Later Jin army. The Khitan/Later Jin army then prepared to head toward Zhao's army, and then to the Later Tang capital Luoyang. Apparently pursuant to Emperor Taizong's suggestion, Shi commissioned Sang and fellow staff member Zhao Ying chancellors (同中書門下平章事, Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi), with Sang also receiving the additional title of Zhongshu Shilang () and Zhao Ying Menxia Shilang (); Sang also continued to act as chief of staff. The Khitan/Later Jin army then crushed Zhao Dejun's army, forcing him and his adoptive son Zhao Yanshou to surrender. (Emperor Taizong subsequently took Zhao Dejun and Zhao Yanshou captive and had them taken to Khitan proper.) Emperor Taizong then decided to let Shi and his Later Jin army head toward Luoyang without the Khitan army (other than a small contingent), not wanting to disturb the Han Chinese of the region. As they parted each other, Emperor Taizong stated to Shi, \\"Liu Zhiyuan, Zhao Ying, and Sang Weihan are all great contributors to your establishment of the empire. Do not abandon them unless they had major faults.\\" As Shi approached Luoyang, Li Congke, finding the situation hopeless, committed suicide with his family, ending Later Tang and allowing Later Jin to take over its territory.  After Shi's takeover of Later Tang territory  In spring 937, Shi Jingtang formally made Sang Weihan chief of staff, along with Li Song. It was said that at that time, Shi had just taken over Later Tang territory, and a number of military governors were either not following his orders, or were not fully faithful to him. (Indeed, there would be several rebellions against Later Jin in 937.) In the midst of all the military campaigns, the treasury was drained, and the people were poor. Further, the Khitan were repeatedly demanding tributes. Sang advised Shi to comfort the military governors and not bear grudges, humbly serve the Khitan and offer tributes, train the army and firm up the defenses, and encourage farming and trade. It was said that within several years, the realm became more secured.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 281. Also in spring 937, Shi was considering moving the capital from Luoyang to Daliang. Sang encouraged the idea, pointing out that at that time, Fan Yanguang the military governor of Tianxiong Circuit (天雄, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) was apparently planning to rebel, and that a move to Daliang, being far closer to Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture () than Luoyang was, would allow quicker reaction against a potential Fan rebellion. Shi agreed and moved the capital to Daliang. Fan did, indeed, rebel shortly after, and also persuaded the general Zhang Congbin () to also rise at Luoyang. Zhang took over Luoyang and killed Shi's sons Shi Chongxin () the military governor of Heyang and Shi Chong'ai () the defender of Luoyang. It was said that at that time nearly every imperial official at Daliang was panicking over this turn of events, but Sang, as he was directing the campaigns against these rebels from the Office of Chief of Staff, was not shaken and continued to handle the situation calmly, thus calming the hearts of others who saw him as well. When Shi, with Zhang's army approaching Daliang, considered fleeing to Taiyuan, Sang urged him earnestly not to do so, and he changed his mind and remained at Daliang. Soon thereafter, the Later Jin forces were able to kill Zhang, and Fan, believing the situation to be hopeless, surrendered to Yang Guangyuan, whom Shi commissioned as the military governor of Tianxiong to replace Fan. The victory over Fan left Yang being the most powerful general of the realm. This caused clashes between him and Sang, as he often made requests that were not in compliance with regulations, and Sang therefore rejected them. Shi's close associate Liu Churang also disliked the power that Sang and Li wielded as chiefs of staff. He thus encouraged Yang to express his displeasure to Shi. Shi felt compelled to remove Sang and Li as chiefs of staff, replacing them with Liu. Sang and Li remained chancellors, and Sang was given the additional post of minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu). However, subsequently, per Sang's suggestion (who believed Yang himself and the Tianxiong command to be too powerful), Shi moved Yang from Tianxiong to Heyang, and divided the Tianxiong command in three — converting Wei Prefecture to a standalone Yedu Municipality (), while diving the rest of Tianxiong into Zhangde (彰德, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan) and Yongqing (永清, headquartered in modern Xingtai, Hebei), to weaken the command. The power struggle between Yang and Sang continued, however. In 939, Yang accused Sang of being partial in his commissioning of officials; overly enriching himself with mansions in both Daliang and Luoyang; and making personal fortunes in competition with the people. Shi felt compelled to remove Sang as chancellor, sending him to Zhangde to serve as its military governor. Shi did give Sang the greater chancellor title of Shizhong () as an honorary title.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. When he got to Zhangde, he found out that there was a longstanding regulation there that any person captured for banditry within the circuit would have their entire family's assets confiscated. Sang, pointing out that there was actually no law allowing such confiscation, reported this to Shi, urging its abolition. Shi agreed, and issued an edict generally abolishing such confiscations throughout the realm, not just as applied to Zhangde. After about a year, Sang was moved to Taining Circuit (泰寧, headquartered in modern Jining, Shandong). At that time, Shi was also faced with the prospect that An Chongrong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), who was antagonistic toward the Khitan (whose state had been renamed Liao by that point), was repeatedly trying to provoke Emperor Taizong, including aligning with the Tuyuhun tribesmen within Liao territory (that was ceded to Liao as part of Shi's agreement to cede the northern territories to Liao). An, in his rhetoric, was also rebuking Shi for being overly groveling to Liao and urging him to turn against Liao. Shi was initially hesitant to take action, because of An's military strength. Sang, hearing this, submitted a secret petition to Shi pointing out that it had been Khitan military strength that allowed him to establish his state, and he therefore should not turn against Liao — and further pointed out that An could be defeated if he rebelled. He encouraged Shi to temporarily move his court to Yedu, so that he could react against An quickly. Shi agreed and thanked Sang for his advice. When An subsequently rebelled, Shi, at Yedu, was able to send his brother-in-law Du Chongwei to crush An's rebellion quickly.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 283. After An's defeat, Sang went to Yedu to pay homage to Shi, and was thereafter made the military governor of Jinchang Circuit (晉昌, headquartered in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). = During Shi Chonggui's reign = In 942, Shi Jingtang fell seriously ill. He initially entrusted his young (and only surviving) son Shi Chongrui () to the chancellor Feng Dao, intending to have Shi Chongrui succeed him. After Shi Jingtang's death, Feng, in consultation with the imperial guard general Jing Yanguang, decided to declare Shi Jingtang's adoptive son and biological nephew Shi Chonggui the Prince of Qi as emperor, because they believed that the state needed an older emperor. In 942, Shi Chonggui recalled Sang Weihan from Jinchang to again be chancellor, with the title of Shizhong. Sang was also put in charge of editing the imperial history. Because of his being instrumental in Shi Chonggui's becoming emperor, Jing was very powerful early in Shi Chonggui's reign as both chancellor and the commander of the imperial guards, and under his advocacy, Shi Chonggui turned away from Shi Jingtang's submissive posture toward Liao, and took a confrontational stance, taking the position that while personally, he was grandson to Emperor Taizong (because Shi Jingtang was son to Emperor Taizong), he and his state were not Liao subjects. Further, in 943, under Jing's advice, Shi Chonggui arrested the Liao trade emissary Qiao Rong () and confiscated the goods that he was trading on Liao's behalf at Kaifeng. Sang repeatedly advised Shi Chonggui against taking provocative positions against Liao, to no avail, as he was opposed by Jing. The Later Jin/Liao enmity led to a major Liao incursion, when Yang Guangyuan rebelled in spring 944, as Emperor Taizong wanted to support Yang's rebellion.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. The Later Jin army was able to defeat Yang and repel the Liao incursion, but by this point, the officials and generals resented Jing for his hold on power, and even Shi believed that Jing was difficult to control. Under Sang's advice, Shi sent Jing out of the capital to serve as Luoyang's defender, putting Gao Xingzhou in command of the imperial guards to replace him. Subsequently, believing that only Sang was capable of defending the state against Liao, Shi reestablished the office of chief of staff (which Shi Jingtang had abolished) and made Sang the chief of staff, in addition to chancellor (now with the title Zhongshu Ling). He also created Sang the Duke of Wei. He entrusted the affairs of the state to Sang, and it was said that within several months, the administration was in much better order. As described in the Zizhi Tongjian: Further, it was said that Sang reacted to things quickly and made quick decisions that people often initially questioned, but then after deeper thought would understand his rationale and obey. However, it was said that he also made his decisions colored by his likes and dislikes, such that people who had helped him before would be repaid, and the people who had hurt him would be damaged, and that his reputation suffered as a result. By 945, however, Shi Chonggui himself was suspicious of Sang, because his close associates Feng Yu (the brother of his wife Empress Feng) and Li Yantao () both disliked Sang and often accused Sang of misdeeds. Shi considered removing Sang from the chancellorship, but did not do so at the urging of fellow chancellors Li Song and Liu Xu. To try to divert the criticism, Sang requested that Feng Yu be made the deputy chief of staff, but the request only made Feng Yu more displeased. Shi eventually commissioned Feng Yu as a chief of staff as well, to divide Sang's responsibility. Later in 945, there was an incident where Du Chongwei (whose name had been changed to Du Wei by this point to observe naming taboo for Shi Chonggui), who was then the military governor of Shunguo Circuit (順國, i.e., Chengde, the name of which was changed to Shunguo after the defeat of An Chongrong's rebellion), fearing a mutiny, left Shunguo against imperial orders and headed for Kaifeng, initially causing much apprehension in the capital. Sang advocated forcing Du into retirement in light of this incident, but Shi Chonggui, citing the fact that Du was an uncle, declined, and was much displeased at Sang for suggesting it. Indeed, at the request of Du's wife the Princess of Song (Shi's aunt), Shi then made Du the military governor of Tianxiong. It was said that Sang did not dare to make major policy suggestions after this point and requested retirement, citing a foot injury. However, it was also said that shortly thereafter, at Sang's suggestion, Shi sent the emissary Zhang Hui () to the Liao court, apologizing and requesting peaceful relations again. Emperor Taizong responded that he wanted to have Sang and Jing Yanguang sent to see him (under the rationale that it was Sang who initially negotiated the alliance, and that it was Jing who broke it) and that Shunguo and Yiwu (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei) Circuits be ceded to Liao, and then a peace could be reentered. Shi found the demand insulting, and cut off further negotiations. At one point in 945, Shi fell seriously ill. During that time, there happened to be an occasion where Sang had sent a maidservant to greet Shi Jingtang's wife Empress Dowager Li, and part of the greeting stated, \\"Has the Emperor's younger brother, Chongrui, been studying well?\\" Shi Chonggui heard of this and discussed this with Feng Yu, and Feng Yu thereafter accused Sang of considering deposing Shi Chonggui and replacing him with Shi Chongrui. As the imperial general Li Shouzhen also disliked Sang, he, Feng Yu, and Li Yantao thereafter suggested that Shi Chonggui remove Sang. Shi Chonggui agreed, and not long after, Sang was removed from his posts as chancellor and chief of staff, and made the mayor of Kaifeng. Zhao Ying, who was then the mayor of Kaifeng, was made chancellor, and Li Song was made chief of staff, to replace him. Thereafter, Sang, claiming his foot to be still injured, made very few attempts to see the emperor, and also did not see guests, to try to avoid suspicion. (When Feng Yu's associates tried to argue to him that being mayor of the capital, with many minute responsibilities, was an inappropriate post for someone with Sang's accomplishments and that he should be given a military governorship, Feng stated that he was fearful that Sang might rebel. When they pointed out that Sang was a civilian and could not rebel, Feng stated, \\"Even if he did not rebel himself, he might encourage someone else to do so,\\" alluding to Sang's having encouraged Shi Jingtang to rebel.) In 946, Emperor Taizong decided to create a trap for Later Jin. He spread false news that Zhao Yanshou was intending to defect to Later Jin, rumors that were believed by Feng and Li Song. They had Du Chongwei (whose name had been changed to Du Wei by that point due to naming taboo for Shi Chonggui's name), who was then the military governor of Tianxiong, write a secret letter to Zhao, to see if Zhao intended to defect. Zhao, who was part of Emperor Taizong's plan, wrote back and indicated that, indeed, he wanted to defect, along with his Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in Beijing — which had previously been Later Tang territory but which Shi Jingtang, as part of the agreement in which Emperor Taizong aided him to become emperor, ceded to Emperor Taizong); in his letter, he asked for a major Later Jin army to be launched to support his defection. After discussions between Shi Chonggui, Feng, and Li Song, it was agreed that a large army would be launched, commanded by Du, with Li Shouzhen serving as his deputy. (This was opposed by Zhao Ying, who believed that Du was untrustworthy due to his unthankful nature, but Zhao Ying was not listened to.) Du's army was soon launched, but as it approached Liao territory, was met by a large, highly mobile Liao army commanded by Emperor Taizong himself. It tried to retreat, but became encircled by the Liao army at Zhongdu Bridge (中度橋, in modern Baoding, Hebei). After Emperor Taizong made a promise (which he would eventually repudiate) to have Du made emperor, Du and Li Shouzhen surrendered with their army. As virtually the entire Later Jin imperial army was under Du's command, Kaifeng was left defenseless, and the Liao army advanced quickly toward it. Even before the news reached Kaifeng, knowing the seriousness of the situation, Sang went to the palace to try to see Shi, but Shi, who was preparing a hunt at that point and not yet fully aware of the implications, refused to see him. When he went to see the chancellors, the chancellors believed that he was being overly alarmist. As he left, Sang lamented to his close associates, \\"The worship of the Jin ancestors is about to end.\\" As the Liao army approached (with its forward corps commanded by the former Later Jin general Zhang Yanze), Shi Chonggui surrendered, ending Later Jin.  Death  Emperor Taizong had stated, in his communications to Shi Chonggui accepting the surrender that he wanted to see Sang Weihan and Jing Yanguang. As Zhang Yanze approached Kaifeng, Sang's associates suggested that he flee. Sang's response is, \\"I am a prominent official. Where can I flee?\\" He remained at his headquarters and waited for orders. Zhang, thereafter, in the name of Shi Chonggui, summoned him. As Sang was walking toward Zhang's headquarters, he ran into Li Song on the road and began conversing with Li. While they were conversing, Zhang sent soldiers, who were respectful to Sang but nevertheless insisted on him heading to Zhang's headquarters. Sang, knowing what his fate would be, turned to Li and stated, \\"You, chancellor, were responsible for the state. Now the state is falling, but how is it that, instead, Sang Weihan would be dying for the state?\\" Li was ashamed and could not respond. When Sang arrived at Zhang's headquarters, Zhang was initially arrogant toward him, sitting high in his seat. Sang rebuked him and stated, \\"Last year, it was I who promoted you from the ranks of the guilty [(Zhang had been accused of wrongly killing a staff member as well as misruling his circuit)]. You received a large circuit and a key command. How is it that you are turning against me like this?\\" Zhang could not respond, and put him under guard. Shortly after, Zhang killed Sang by strangulation, but put a belt around his neck and claimed to Emperor Taizong that Sang committed suicide. Emperor Taizong exclaimed, \\"I had no desire to kill Sang Weihan. How did this happen?\\" He ordered that Sang's family members be comforted. (The traditional histories Old History of the Five Dynasties and New History of the Five Dynasties attributed Zhang's actions to a request by Shi to Zhang, as Shi was apprehensive that if Emperor Taizong got to meet Sang, Sang would reveal the details behind Shi's turning against Liao, but Sima Guang, the lead author of the Zizhi Tongjian, found the account lacking in credibility as Zhang was acting arrogantly toward the Shi imperial household at the time such that he found it implausible that Zhang would follow any orders from Shi by that point, let alone killing Sang, and therefore concluded that Zhang killed Sang out of personal grudge.)Hu Sanxing's Commentaries to the Zizhi Tongjian, citing Sima Guang's Kaoyi (考異).

The episode was written by Scott Reynolds and was directed by Steve Shill. Title The title is a play on the 1998 film There's Something About Mary, referring to revelations about Dexter's adoptive father Harry Morgan. Plot After their latest confrontation, Dexter imprisons Doakes in a cabin hidden in the Florida Everglades, but is unsure of what to do next. Doakes reveals information that leads Dexter to a surprising discovery about his foster father's death. The FBI continues the search for Doakes, while LaGuerta tries to prove his innocence. As the investigation comes to a close, Debra realizes that Lundy will leave Miami at the end of the investigation. She confronts him about the future of their relationship. Rita and Dexter reconcile and visit the beach together, while Lila plans to frame Angel for raping her. Production Filming locations for the episode included Palos Verdes Estates, Long Beach, Marina del Rey, and two neighborhoods in Los Angeles, California (Playa del Rey and Venice). Reception The episode was positively received. IGN's Eric Goldman gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, and commented that \\"[w]hen you raise the stakes as much as last week's Dexter did, it's difficult maintaining momentum. So it was with the latest episode, which calmed down a bit (but only a bit), but clearly was laying groundwork for the huge confrontations coming in the final two episodes.\\" The A.V. Club critic Scott Tobias gave the episode an A grade and stated that \\"the twist [in the episode] hit like the proverbial ton of bricks, one of those delicious turns that’s both out of the blue and perfectly in keeping with the spirit of the show. What’s more, it’s all about character. A lesser show would be feeding the beast at this juncture, i.e. tying things up as a serialized thriller is supposed to do and hopefully springing a few surprises along the way. But Dexter has never been some run-of-the-mill policier, and the writers have stepped up their game this season.\\" References External links  \\"There's Something About Harry\\" at Showtime's website Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Dexter (TV series) episodes ","title":"There's Something About Harry"},{"id":"42158477","text":"An Environmental Literacy Plan (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the No Child Left Inside (movement) (NCLI) of 2008 which the House of Representatives passed on September 18, 2008. As outlined by the NCLI of 2008, ELP’s must contain numerous and explicit provisions. The North American Association for Environmental Education (NAAEE) condenses NCLI act into five components which allow states to become eligibile for funds allocated through the NCLI act. The purpose of an ELP is to create a comprehensive education plan for environmental literacy that can be evaluated on the basis of student learning outcomes. the NCLI legislation defines goals as follows. Advancing content and achievement standards, Developing or disseminating innovations or model programs, Research, particularly on integrating environmental education in the study of other subjects and Capacity-building measures to increase the number of elementary and secondary environmental education teachers.  Definition  An Environmental Literacy Plan (ELP) refers to a state education plan to teach about how ecosystems and human systems are interdependent, particularly, how the consumption choices human beings make alter their ability to live sustainably. ELP’s serve as a central component of the 2008 No Child Left Inside (movement) (NCLI) which the House of Representatives passed. = State standards, content areas, and courses or subjects = Environmental Literacy Plan’s include environmental literacy content standards in grades Pre-K through 12th grade. Curriculum integration of the environmental literacy standards into the curriculum occur through content integration or as standalone topics of learning. \\"Attention should be paid to mandated learning outcomes and curriculum content, standardized tests, and instructional syllabuses\\". Clear and supported learning standards are required to ensure high school graduates possess a determined degree of environmental literacy. = High school graduation requirements = One component of an ELP is the consideration of how environmental literacy will be incorporated into the state’s graduation requirement. Hence high school courses should be aligned with the topic of environmental literacy, programming opportunities for students should be offered or credits for environmental literacy should be a requirement for graduation. = Professional development = The ELP provides provisions for both pre-service and in-service teacher preparation. Teacher preparation within the field of environmental literacy will need to support learning using place-based and experiential learning strategies. \\"The work of reorienting teachers education for the values of sustainability is crucial to creating a new understanding of ourselves and our place in communities, in the living world and in traditions of relational reciprocity that will sustain us all\\". = Assessment of environmental literacy = The initial ELP should contain a detailed description of how the state education agency will assess and measure the learning achieved through the implementation of the ELP. The assessment of environmental literacy of students will measure the extent to which the ELP was successful. = Implementation and support = Key logistical and implementation issues will be addressed within the ELP. One of the most essential components of the ELP is planning for future funding and support. As designated by the NCLI act of 2008 funding tampers off after the initial year of implementation and eventually reduces to 50% of total program expenses. The ELP outlines and anticipates future sources of funding for the state environmental literacy program. The ELP also considers how federal and state education-related legislation and initiatives such as IDEA or STEM funding will be integrated into the overall environmental literacy program.

He was the abbot of a monastery in Glasnevin, where he was a teacher of Columba, Canice, Comgall, and Ciarán. Background In John Colgan's work Trias Thaumaturga he is called \\"Berchan, that is, Mobhi Clairenach, of Glasnevin, son of Beoain, son of Bresal, son of Ailgin, son of Ignaidh, son of Athraid and Lugnaidh, Trinog, son of Brecdulb, son of Airt Corp, son of Caerbreniadh, in Glasnevin, in the territory of Galeny, near the River Liffey\\" (in regione Gallangabeg juxta Liffeum flumen). He was a relative of Brigit of Kildare. The Martyrology of Oengus calls him \\"son of Beóán, of Corco trí, of the Luigni of Connaught,\\" and says that his mother was \\"Uaine, Findbarr's daughter.\\" Life His surname, clárainech, means \\"flat faced\\" in Irish, a reference to his being born without eyes or a nose. The Martyrology of Oengus mentions that he was \\"table faced,\\" ascribing the condition to the fact that he had been \\"conceived and brought forth, and of a dead woman he was begotten.\\" The immediate cause of his strange physiognomy was that the \\"earth pressed him down\\" during the unfortunate circumstances of his birth. He was said to have been miraculously cured of this deformity when he splashed the baptismal water of Saint David on his face three times. Mobhí was the teacher of a monastic school, where he was the tutor of many influential Irish saints. His school had about fifty students at its height. A legend is recorded about Mobhí and Columba (also called Columcille) that elaborates on the condition of these monastic schools: It was Mobhí who gave Columba permission, with his last breath, to found the School of Derry. He died on 12 October 544 of the plague that had broken up his school. Veneration Mobhí was recognised as a saint by his own pupils soon after his death. The 17th-century Martyrology of Donegal recounts the story that when Columba was preparing to take possession of the town of Doire from Aedh, son of Ainmire, he initially refused to do so because he did not have his Mobhí's permission. It was only when two of Mobhí's followers met him, carrying the saint's girdle, and informed Columba that Mobhí was dead, that he accepted. Columba then remarked, \\"Good was the man who had this girdle, for it was never opened for gluttony, nor closed on falsehood.\\" Columba later expanded that sentiment into a quatrain: Archbishop John Healy, in his book Insula Sanctorum et Doctorum, called Saint Mobhí \\"a great master of the spiritual life.\\" His feast day is celebrated on 12 October, and today there is a Church of Ireland parish in Glasnevin named for Saint Mobhí. =Martyrologies= The Martyrology of Oengus (c. 800)—the earliest Irish calendar of saints—lists the following on 12 October: The Martyrology of Donegal lists him on 12 October, the day of his death, and commemorates him in the following manner: \\"Mobhi Clairenech, abbot, of Glass Naoidhen, in Fine- Gall, on the brink of the river Lifè, on the north side; and Bearchán was another name for him.\\" References Category:Medieval saints of Leinster Category:6th-century Irish people Category:6th-century Christian saints Category:6th-century deaths from plague (disease) Category:544 deaths Category:Year of birth missing ","title":"Mobhí Clárainech"},{"id":"42158503","text":"Behavioral Endocrinology is a branch of endocrinology that studies the Neuroendocrine system and its effects on behavior.

In the case of local redundancy, the pairs of redundant inferences having the same pivot occur close to each other in the proof. However, redundant inferences can also occur far apart in the proof.

Juliette is portrayed by actress Hayden Panettiere since the pilot episode, which aired on October 10, 2012. Juliette was a teenage country sensation and is now making more mature music. She tries to take the throne, as Queen of Country music, from rival Rayna Jaymes. Panettiere has received critical acclaim for her performance as Juliette including nominations for two Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television Series Drama in 2013 and 2014, a Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2012 and a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Casting and creation The casting of Hayden Panettiere as Juliette Barnes was announced on February 29, 2012. Juliette was characterized as an up-and-coming country- pop diva and rival of series co-lead Rayna Jaymes, a fading country star played by Connie Britton. Although best known as an actress, Panettiere had a brief music career, recording songs for several films between 2004 and 2007 and planning to release an album. Though she co-wrote and recorded some songs for it, it was never completed or released. She later explained: \\"I quit after about four or five years of recording, and I said this is not me. But I said that if I was ever going to do music again, I would do country music, and for this [Nashville] to come along and to get both of the things I love [acting and country music] combined in one show, it's a dream come true.\\" Panettiere has denied media reports that her character resembles Taylor Swift, (who was also born in 1989) and states that Juliette is instead based on herself—a young woman in the entertainment industry—and Carrie Underwood. She was attracted to the character because she was \\"so multidimensional\\" and because she wanted to \\"break away from her character in Heroes.\\" Panettiere has revealed that she was not the first choice to play the role, as the producers were not sure she would be able to render Juliette vulnerable enough to be likeable. However, after Panettiere was cast, the writers re-wrote Juliette, who was originally seen as a supporting character to Rayna James' series lead, to be a co-lead alongside her. Storylines =Background= Juliette Jolene Barnes is a CMA-winning country singer born in 1988. At the age of 14, Juliette was discovered by Glenn Goodman at an Alabama county fair, and then later (around age 16) Glenn became her manager. After emancipating at 16 Juliette moved to Nashville, Tennessee and signed with Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records in 2010. Her debut album, \\"Juliette,\\" was an instant success: it reached the number one position on the Billboard Country Chart and went multi-platinum. Her sophomore record \\"All My Angels\\" was an even bigger success with her mostly tween following and reached number one on both the Billboard Country Chart & the Billboard 200 Chart. While she was recording her third album, Juliette was charged with petty theft after a fan recorded her stealing a small bottle of nail polish from a local drug store. It also came to light that her mother was a drug addict. Juliette got her life back on track by releasing a co-written song with country legend, Rayna Jaymes titled \\"Wrong Song.\\" Juliette ultimately became engaged to rookie football player, Sean Butler. Juliette left Sean at the altar and began her world tour \\"Red Lips White Lies\\" with Rayna Jaymes. It was later revealed that Juliette and Sean had eloped a few days before their ceremony. The marriage was ultimately annulled. Months later Juliette was in the headlines again with her mother's untimely death after a drug-fueled murder-suicide with her sober companion Dante Reeves. Juliette's fourth record, \\"Inside The Dream,\\" came out in early 2014 and was successful, but her sound had matured. It was kept from the top spot on the charts by Rayna Jaymes's \\"The Best Of\\" album released after her car accident which left her in a coma for two weeks. Barnes was then eventually asked to join the Grand Ole Opry as a member by Rayna James in later 2014. Barnes continued to mature her sound after this and began to garner an adult fan base as she rebranded her \\"Red Lips And White Lies\\" tour after Rayna quit to spend time with her daughters, and embarked on her \\"Inside The Dream\\" North American Tour with Layla Grant and Will Lexington as her opening acts. During this time though Barnes was black-listed from country radio and country music fans after news broke of her affair with mogul, Charles Wentworth and after she was misquoted as saying \\"There is no God\\" to a crowd of protesters outside of her concert arena. Fans immediately turned on the country singer holding burnings of her albums, along with having promoters cancel her concerts after bomb threats were sent to the locations. Layla Grant then cleared the air that Barnes actually said \\"There is no God who would listen to a crackpot like you.\\" Unfortunately it took radio and fans a long time to move forward from this. Barnes then fueled the flames refusing to be forced to apologize for something she hadn't done, by performing her new song \\"Don't Put Dirt On My Grave Just Yet\\", (co-written with Avery Barkley) during her induction to the Grand Ole Opry. This decision led to Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records dropping her immediately following her performance and stores no longer carrying her physical albums. Barnes, though black listed, was offered recording contracts from major labels outside of Nashville such as Capital, Interscope, and Warner Brothers to name a few. Barnes decided not to sign with any large label in order to maintain her musical freedom and not be forced to make a pop record. Ultimately despite an offer from Edgehill to re- sign her offering her an imprint and a $250,000 producing deal for her boyfriend Avery, she signed with country legend Rayna Jaymes's label Highway 65 Records, though no music was released during her year on this label. During this year Barnes married her boyfriend Avery Barkley, and the couple had their first child, a daughter named Cadence. Barnes also made her film debut playing the role of country icon, Patsy Cline along with actor Noah West in the film \\"Shenandoah Girl\\". Barnes was then nominated for an Oscar award as Best Actress for her performance in the film. After Barnes departed from Highway 65 Records, she signed with Country singer Luke Wheeler's label \\"Wheelin' Dealin' Records\\". During this time she fired longtime on and off manager, Glenn Goodman and hired former CEO of Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records Jeff Fordham as her manager. Through Wheeler's label she then released her critical & commercially successful album 2016's \\"Unleashed\\" (that she recorded while under Highway 65 Records before being bought out of her contract) which debuted at #1 on both Billboards 200 chart and Billboards Country Chart. Barnes then joined Luke Wheeler's \\"Never Back Down Tour\\" and continued on it as an opening act until she took a break after attacking a fan in the lobby of a hotel in Atlanta and the death of her manager via suicide the following day. Barnes then kept a low profile only being heard from when the announcement of her divorce from Avery Barkley was made public. Barnes continued to keep a low profile until it was announced she was going to star in her 2nd picture following her raved performance in \\"Shenandoah Girl\\", a Stephen Spielberg film. But before filming began during its press tour it was revealed that Barnes had been keeping a low profile as she had been in rehab for the past 3 months dealing with emotional issues and her battle with postpartum depression which she stated cost her her relationship with her daughter, and her marriage. Following more down time, Barnes was ultimately in a deadly Plane crash after leaving the 2016 Oscars in order to reunite with her estranged husband and daughter. The crash led to the untimely death of 6 workers on the plane as Barnes was the sole survivor. Barnes was left handicap in a wheelchair after breaking her legs and having severe damage to her nervous system. Over the following months, Barnes was one of very few people to make a miraculous recovery and was ultimately able to walk again. Barnes still battles with PTSD but was able to find peace eventually with religion and her family. After going through such traumatic experiences Barnes ultimately recorded her follow up album to 2015's \\"Unleashed\\". The album titled \\"Grateful\\" was a religious album released through Highway 65 Records after the label bought \\"Wheelin' Dealin' Records\\". Unfortunately for Barnes, despite her personal struggles, the album was a critical & commercial failure as fans and critics did not support the record. Barnes then made her comeback that same year with the hit single \\"Water Rising\\". She was nominated for the Pop/Rock AMA but publicly withdrew herself admitting to having stolen the song from up and comer singer Maddie Jaymes (Daughter of deceased country queen Rayna Jaymes). After nearly getting dropped from Rayna's label \\"Highway 65 Records\\" which Maddie was on and is now run by Maddie's father and Rayna's husband Deacon Claybourne, Juliette took some time off too focus on herself. Barnes then made her comeback in 2018 with her hit single \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" which was a call for love song. During the first concert of her comeback \\"Thicker Than Water\\" tour Barnes was reported to have had a 5-minute rant during her first song when a protester put absurd hate signs up and started shouting hate speech at her. She later on that week went on the radio opening up about her battle with severe depression and then decided to postpone her tour. Barnes has a catalogue of hit songs including \\"Love Like Mine\\", \\"Telescope\\", \\"Boys and Buses\\", \\"Hypnotizing\\", \\"Trouble Is\\",\\"Wrong Song\\", \\"Tell that Devil\\", \\"What If It's You\\", \\"Mississippi Flood\\", \\"Last Honest Man\\", \\"One Place Too Long\\", \\"Don't Put Dirt On My Grave Just Yet\\", \\"Nothing In This World Will Ever Break My Heart Again\\", \\"Hole In The World\\", \\"Consider Me\\", and most recently \\"Water Rising\\" & \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\". =Albums= 2010: Juliette 2012: All My Angels 2014: Inside The Dream 2015: Unleashed 2017: Grateful 2017: Thicker Than Water =Singles= 2010: I'm A Girl - Radio Single 2010: Gonna Get Even - Radio Single 2012: Love Like Mine - Radio Single, #1 hit 2012: Telescope - Radio Single, #1 hit 2012: Boys and Buses - Radio Single, #1 hit 2013: Wrong Song featuring Rayna Jaymes - Radio Single, #1 hit 2013: Yellin' From The Rooftop - Radio Single 2013: Consider Me - Radio Single, #1 hit 2014: Hypnotizing - Radio Single, #1 hit 2014: Trouble Is - Radio Single 2014: Dreams - Radio Single 2014: We Are Water - Digital Single 2015: Don't Put Dirt On My Grave Just Yet - Digital Single 2015: Tell That Devil - Radio Single 2016: Mississippi Flood - Radio Single 2016: Last Honest Man - Radio Single 2016: Crazy (Theme song from the major motion film \\"Shenandoah Girl\\") - Digital and promotional Single 2016: What If It's You - Radio Single 2016: Crazy featuring Steven Tyler - Digital / Tour Single 2016: Hole In The World - Radio Single 2016: One Place Too Long - Radio Single 2016: Boomtown featuring Luke Wheeler - Radio Single 2017: On My Way - Not released to radio 2017: On My Way (Choir Version) - Not released to radio 2017: Water Rising - Not released to radio 2018: Is There Anybody Out There? - Not released to radio 2018: I Always Will - Not released to radio =Labels= *Edgehill Republic Entertainment Records (2010-2015) *Highway 65 Records (2015) *Wheelin' Dealin Records (2015-2016) *Highway 65 Records (2016-) =Tours= 2010: All My Angels Tour 2012: Red Lips White Lies Tour [Co- Headlined with Rayna Jaymes] 2014: Inside The Dream North American Tour 2014: Music City Music Festival 2015: Never Back Down Tour (Opening Act to Luke Wheeler) 2018: Thicker Than Water Tour (Postponed) =Films= 2015: Shenandoah Girl (Oscar nominated Role for Biopic of Country Legend Patsy Cline) =Awards= 2013: CMA Female Vocalist Of The Year 2014: Inducted Into The Grand Ole Opry As A Member 2015: CMA Song of the Year Nominated for \\"Don't Put Dirt On My Grave Just Yet\\" 2016: AMA Pop/Rock Song of the year nominated for \\"Water Rising\\" (Until she removed herself) =Character profile= Juliette Barnes, originally from Alabama, was discovered singing at a country fair by her manager, Glenn Goodman at age 14, who believed he could turn her into one of America's biggest country stars. Juliette, being young, beautiful and ambitious, had no qualms about leaving her dysfunctional home life and her drug-addicted mother behind (Juliette's father died when she was 4 years old). Juliette emancipated at 16 and moved to Nashville, TN. She quickly rose to become Edgehill Republic Records biggest star, a pop-country sensation, with legions of young teenage fans and sell out tours. Despite Juliette's singing talent being questioned by several characters, including Rayna Jaymes, she shows not only raw talent but has also proven herself to be a capable songwriter and works with talented musicians such as Deacon Clayborne and Avery Barkley. Juliette and Rayna, however, have two things in common, both of them had bad parents and both of them left home when they were 16 to become famous country music stars. Juliette is initially played as a demanding, arrogant diva, but there is another side to her. The main reason why she was the main antagonist in the series. She is a girl who has fought for everything she has and is prepared to do anything to get to the top. However, her hard exterior shields a world of pain that she rarely lets people see. She has no friends, no-one she can truly turn to, and she has seen the worst of people growing up, which has left her unable to connect with people emotionally. As a result, she shows a desperate desire to be loved by anyone who shows her the slightest bit of affection, such as when she falls in love with her mother's drug counselor. There are signs of trauma/abuse being present in childhood. In season 6 Juliette was diagnosed with dissociation (not related to the plane crash) but trauma in early childhood. =Season 1= When the series begins, Juliette is a fast-rising star, with the potential to topple Queen of Country, Rayna Jaymes. Juliette sees Rayna as a has-been, while Rayna sees Juliette as a talentless bimbo. To the public, Juliette is a sweet-natured, fun loving, glamorous bubble-gum country star. Behind the scenes, however, Juliette is neither sweet natured or fun, but rather a cold-hearted, demanding, spoiled young woman who wants what she wants when she wants it, and what she wants is to be the Queen of Country. Despite a string of number ones and sell-out tours, Juliette struggles to be taken seriously, having her vocals auto-tuned and her videos being cheesy and clichéd, she decides to work with Deacon Clayborne and when she writes with him, he is the first one to recognize her potential as a songwriter. The rivalry between her and Rayna comes to a head when Rayna is promoted from an opening act to co-touring with Juliette and their management suggest they write a song together. Rayna tells Juliette a few home truths about her talent and how her diva-like behavior will be the end of her. This upsets Juliette, however when Deacon shows Rayna the lyrics Juliette has written, Rayna begrudgingly admits she may have been wrong. They finally admit their mutual dislike for each other however manage to finish a song together called \\"Wrong Song\\" which goes straight to number one. The two are forced to admit a respect for one another despite their continuing dislike. In her personal life, Juliette is set up on a date by a famous football player for the Tennessee Titans named Sean Butler, as her management thinks it will be good press. Juliette finds him sweet, especially when he reveals his intentions to remain a virgin until marriage, a first for Juliette who has only met men who want her for something. However Juliette is looked on with scorn by Sean's family, especially his mother, who thinks Juliette is trash, which brings out Juliette's vindictive side and she seduces Sean which leads to a rather hasty marriage. However Juliette realises Sean is a genuinely good person and that she would just end up hurting him when he doesn't deserve to be, so she agrees to an annulment. Juliette's life is further complicated when her drug-addicted mother, Jolene, comes back into her life. All her life, Juliette remembers her irresponsible mother letting her down and losing her every time to drugs with Juliette having to clean up after her and often being on the receiving end of her mother's drug fuelled violence. However once again she ends up helping her mother, paying for her rehab and eventually falling for her mother's drug counsellor Dante. No one trusts Dante, who swiftly begins to take over Juliette's life, her finances and her career, but Juliette is so blindly in love with him she ignores everyone. In the end, everyone is proved right as Dante flees with a chunk of Juliette's money and also tries to blackmail her out of $10 million with a sex tape he has of the two of them. Juliette refuses to give into his demands and instead issues a statement confessing her role in the tape and how it was released without her permission which garners her respect. However Jolene, finally deciding to help her daughter after years of letting her down, murders Dante, destroys the tape and then kills herself with a drug overdose, devastating Juliette. =Season 2= Juliette is introduced to Edgehill's new CEO, Jeff Fordham, and Layla Grant, who rose to fame after being the runner-up in a singing competition. Much like how Juliette was wanting to take Rayna's place, Layla wants to do the same to Juliette. Juliette complains that she isn't country and makes fun of her when she says \\"y'all\\" because she is from Connecticut. Following the events of Rayna's wreck, she wants to cancel the remainder of the tour to spend more time with her daughters, which doesn't make Juliette happy. Juliette wants to move away from doing over-the-top numbers and refuses to play half-houses. Desperately wanting to keep playing to full arenas, she asks Layla to open up for her. Juliette is invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, which leaves her speechless. Billionaire Charles \\"Charlie\\" Wentworth hires Juliette to sing at his anniversary party as a gift for his wife Olivia because she is a huge fan of hers. At the party, Juliette and Charlie sneak off to the house and sleep together. The two meet up again at the annual Bell Meade Polo tournament and end up sleeping together again only this time, unbeknownst to them, Olivia walks in on them. While on tour in Houston, Juliette decides that she no longer wants to suck up to a powerful DJ to get good reviews and airplay which leads to critics leaving the show before her set and bad reviews. Charlie, who owns several radio stations, gets the DJ fired when he hears of this but has him rehired when Juliette regrets what Charlie did. Still in Houston, Juliette gets a surprise visit from Olivia, who hits on her. It turns out Charlie and Olivia just wanted her to be a part of their threesome. After this, and following her confronting them about their lifestyle, Charlie divorces Olivia. Juliette begins to feel threatened by Layla when she steals some of her spotlight and gets distracted. When Layla goes over her set time, making Juliette's set and the show run late, at the next show she flips Layla and Will's sets. Just as Layla is supposed to go on stage to sing with Will, Juliette barges in, takes the mic and sings with him instead. To get back at her, Layla calls the press to inform them that Juliette is the cause of the Wentworths' divorce. At the Music City Festival, the press hound her. She tells Glenn to find the person who leaked to the press but soon suspects that Layla might have had something to do with it. Jeff goes to Layla, telling her that if she had anything to do with it, she will be dropped from the label. When Juliette arrives at the next tour stop, she is greeted by angry picketers who harass her and call her names. Her reputation takes another blow when someone edits a video of her so it sounds like she said \\"there is no God\\". She turns to Layla for help as a way to clear her name. Because of this, venues are dropping her, leaving Jeff furious so he makes her apologize for her comment or she will be dropped. Avery goes to cheer her up and they write a song together. The two begin dating. Juliette is told to make an apology at her Grand Ole Opry ceremony. Not liking what is written for her to say, she ignores the teleprompter and begins singing \\"Don't Put Dirt on My Grave Just Yet\\". Once again making Jeff furious, he drops her from the label. Juliette goes to hide at Avery's. Howie D, a high-powered, hit-making record producer, hears the new tweaked version of the song and wants to work with Juliette. She flies to Los Angeles to meet with him and record it. Glenn is feeling sidelined with everything going on so he tells Juliette that he is resigning from being her manager and is heading back to Nashville. Not feeling what Howie D has in store for her, she goes to Glenn saying that she doesn't want to move away from being a country music singer and can't do it without him. Juliette runs into Jeff at a restaurant and he offers her a new record deal but she turns him down. She also bumps Will and Layla from her tour. As a way to resurrect her career, Juliette asks Rayna to sign her to Highway 65 Records, Rayna's newly founded record label. Feeling upstage by newer talent, she sabotages the label party by going on stage announcing that she is now with the label. Juliette goes to Charlie asking for a favor when she faces more empty seats on her tour but he wants to get back together with her, and Avery tells him to go away. Rayna tells Juliette that she wants Scarlett to open for her on tour. After Scarlett has a meltdown on stage, Avery spends time with her, making Juliette jealous. Avery assures that she is the one that he loves. At the BMI party, feeling wasted, Juliette runs into Jeff and they end up having sex. Gunnar sees them leaving the screening room together while collecting themselves. Gunnar tries to hide the secret from Avery but tells Zoey. Jeff blackmails Juliette into signing with him or he'll tell Avery what happened between them. Juliette goes to Rayna saying that it was a mistake signing with her and wants out of her contract, but Rayna tells her no and that there is too much at stake. She later reveals to Rayna that she mistakenly slept with Jeff. With Avery sensing there is something going on with Gunnar and Zoey, they confess Juliette's secret to him. He goes to Juliette and breaks up with her. She begs him to stay, but he leaves anyway. When Juliette is in Fort Campbell for a show that Luke Wheeler is putting on for the troops, it is revealed that Juliette's dad was a Blackhawk pilot. He died when she was four. However, the new writers, having not watched previous seasons of the series, unknowingly stated (in season five), that her dad died in a car accident, and showed this. =Season 3= Juliette has a hard time getting over Avery and these emotions show through when she auditions to play Patsy Cline in a movie. Her emotions work in her favor, and Juliette ends up getting the role. When Juliette keeps getting sick, Glenn has a doctor come over to check on her. As he is leaving, the doctor tells her that she is pregnant. Juliette schedules an abortion; however, she finds out that she's further along, and realizes the baby is not Jeff's. She keeps the baby, resulting in her being unable to get through rehearsals due to morning sickness. This makes Glenn and Emily suspicious, and Juliette walks in on them searching her house. Angry that they believe she's on drugs, she makes them leave without telling them the truth. Meanwhile, she also starts to become friends with her movie co-star, Noah West. Juliette eventually turns to Rayna for help. She finally tells Glenn and Emily, and lets them know she wants to give the baby up for adoption discreetly, figuring she'll drop out of the public eye before anyone notices and attribute the weight gain to getting into the role of Patsy Cline. Avery ends up getting arrested after getting drunk and trespassing. Juliette bails him out, and Avery tells her that he wishes he never met her. Juliette decides to keep the baby and raise it on her own. Emily tries to convince Juliette to tell Avery, and Juliette finally sends Avery a text. While she's on set filming the movie later, Avery shows up and makes a scene when Juliette won't see him. However, Glenn gets him to leave. When Juliette becomes worried about shooting a love scene because it'll reveal her pregnancy, Noah reveals he overheard Avery and helps cover up her secret. Noah later shows up at her show, and says that he enjoys spending time with her. While she's performing, Juliette becomes short of breath and leaves the stage, where Noah catches her when she collapses. Juliette is rushed to the hospital, where the doctor tells her that she has to cancel the tour immediately. Avery shows up at the hospital, but leaves when Noah comes in. Juliette, though, tracks him down and tells him if he wants to be the baby's father, he'll need to let her be a part of his life as well. Avery, though, tells Juliette that he will get to be the baby's father on his terms. Juliette later reveals her pregnancy to the media as why she's cancelling her tour, and admits that Avery is the father when a reporter asks. Around the one-year anniversary of her mother's death, Juliette has flashbacks of her childhood. At the CMA's Juliette meets Avery's parents; his mom adores her while his father doesn't. When walking back to her seat she overhears his dad saying that he doesn't think that she and Avery will make good parents and brings up her past. Avery vows that they won't be like their parents. Juliette tells him that they are having a girl. Weeks after the CMA's, Juliette asks Avery to move in with her after the baby is born just for a little while. Avery later asks Juliette to marry him, she says yes, and they have a judge marry them. After canceling her baby shower, Juliette's water breaks while arguing with Rayna. She is rushed to the hospital where she has her baby girl, Cadence. After having Cadence, Juliette is more focused on her career than the baby and neglects her. Emily is concerned and informs Avery. They call in Juliette's doctor who thinks she is suffering from postpartum depression but she denies it. Worrying about not having a career after having a baby, she rushes to make a new album, and has unauthorized roof top performances all across the country. Rayna is not happy with it since the label is the one getting fined for it and she also wants Juliette to take some time off before making a new record. After getting in an argument with Rayna, Bucky and Glenn, Juliette leaves Highway 65 and fires Glenn. She then goes to Jeff asking if he can be her new manager and signs with Luke Wheeler's Wheelin' Dealin' Records. While Avery complains to Juliette about not spending time with baby, she throws a snow globe at them but barely misses hitting them. Avery becomes fed up with Juliette's behavior and leaves town with Cadence. =Season 4= A month has passed and Juliette is on top of the world. Her new movie is a hit and her new album is coming out soon. Juliette has not seen or talked to Avery and Cadence in a month, and ignores Avery when he texts her. While out in Los Angeles touring with Luke and promoting her movie she breaks down and calls Rayna saying she needs help. Rayna who just officially dropped Juliette from Highway 65 flies out to Los Angeles to go see because she cares about her. When Rayna goes to talk to her after her set, Juliette only yells at her and says that she is not having good luck with Highway 65. Juliette's bitterness towards Layla continues when she tells Layla that she will be Jeff's number one client. She also tells her that Jeff does not love her, leaving Layla sad. Juliette comes back to Nashville and reconnects with Avery and Cadence. They go with her to her pre-album party but it turns out it was just for publicity. Without informing Avery, Juliette leaves town as well as leaving her phone at home. On her jet Jeff is seen giving her a new phone, confirming with him that no one has the number to it. Once away from Nashville, she parties, drinks, and has a doctor prescribe her medication, Including uppers, downers, and hypnotics. With Juliette being absent Avery needs help taking care of Cadence so he gets Emily (Who is still on Juliettes payroll) to help babysit her. One afternoon when Avery relieves Emily, the paparazzi takes pictures of the three of them together. The tabloids make up headlines, insinuating that Avery is cheating. Juliette sees and believes this so she calls Emily in a fit of anger, calling her a \\"gold digging backstabbing whore.\\" Avery desperately calls Juliette when Cadence is rushed to the hospital with a 104° temperature, but one of her assistants answers. Her assistant tells Juliette that someone is on the phone for her but Juliette who is all strung out on alcohol and medication says that if it's not important hang up. Avery didn't mention that the baby was in the hospital. Maddie goes with Luke to Atlanta for his show there and to see Juliette perform. Juliette and Maddie spend time together, and she invites her to sing a song with her on stage. Luke is not pleased with this because she knows that Rayna will not be happy about it when she finds out. Later on Juliette realizes that she couldn't believe that she thought something was going on with Avery and Emily. She calls to apologize to Emily, and on her way back home to Nashville she finds out that Cadence went to the hospital. Before she has a chance to get on the plane she runs into Avery. Avery, who is fed up with her behavior, informs her that he wants a divorce and full custody of Cadence. Juliette agrees to everything but is miserable. When she walks out of her hotel she is in a haze and attacks a fan. Jeff says that he can spin the attack on the fan to something more favourable in the press. They have the fan say that she had been stalking Juliette and finally went too far. Juliette mixes pills with alcohol again, texts Avery that she is sorry and goes to the hotel roof to kill herself. Jeff sees her stumbling on the rooftop of the building and rushes to her. Right as she is about to fall Jeff saves her, but in the momentum of pushing her back to safety he falls off the ledge and dies. The next morning she wakes up to the police knocking on her door to tell her about what happen to Jeff and ask questions. She has no memories of the night before. As she is leaving the hotel reporters ask how she is feeling. She tells them how do you think she feels, because her manager just committed suicide. Colt (Luke's son) tells his father that he saw Juliette on the ledge of the roof and Jeff falling while saving her. Luke tells Juliette this but she tells him that she was in her room. Right before Juliette goes on stage in Nashville she remembers what happened to Jeff, and goes back to her dressing room. Juliette admits to Luke that she was drunk, going to kill herself and that Jeff died while saving her. That night Juliette enters rehab. Avery is told what to say about Juliette's absence, and not mention she is in rehab/treatment at Rayna and Deacon's wedding. At the reception Colt confesses to Layla what happen to Jeff. As a way to get revenge, Layla asks Glenn to be her manager, and wants Avery to be her producer. While in rehab Juliette signs the divorce papers. Juliette is eventually released and is able to go back home to Nashville. Juliette starts to change and become a better person. The moment she gets home she has a lucrative offer to be in a Steven Spielberg movie, but accepting means she will have to be in Prague for two weeks filming it. She accepts but during the press conference she quits so she can spend more time with Cadence. Avery limits the time Juliette can spend with her at first, because he doesn't quite trust her yet. When Layla finds out that Juliette is back in town she asks Avery to be her musical director right as she is about to hit the road opening up for Luke. Juliette gets jealous when she sees them rehearsing together, and doesn't want Avery and Cadence to be on the road with Layla. To keep an eye on things, Juliette asks Luke if she can replace his friend Riff left to leave the tour. Avery and Layla get closer while working on her album. One night Avery lets Juliette keep Cadence for the night but just so he can spend the night with Layla. The next morning, Juliette finds out that she was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in Shenandoah Girl and that Avery spent the night with Layla. Juliette confesses to Layla the truth about the night Jeff died while saving her, but Layla says that nothing has changed between them. At the premiere for Shenandoah Girl, she reunites with her co-star Noah West, and the two end up having a brief fling. When the Oscars roll around, Juliette is tired of going to all the pre-parties, and wants to see Cadence. Juliette tells Glenn the truth about Jeff's death. Layla leaks the information and Jeff's sister ends up suing Juliette for wrongful death. Juliette and Glenn figure out Layla was the one who leaked it. Layla tries to get Avery to not go see Juliette on Oscar night, but he does not want to break any plans. Layla calls Jeff's sister and tells her to call Colt, because he saw everything. Layla then tells Avery that Jeff's sister has an eyewitness. Jeff's sister asks for three million dollars, and if she is paid this much, then she will back down. Juliette makes her lawyers pay it, confesses everything to the press, and skips out on the Oscars. Avery confronts Layla about her lying, and realizing the extent of her manipulation, dumps her and calls her crazy. Avery is waiting for Juliette at the airport, but he is told that Juliette's plane sent out a distress signal 90 miles away from Nashville and is missing. =Season 5= Juliette's plane has crashed, with Juliette as the only survivor. Following this, Juliette experiences severe survivor's guilt and must deal with her injuries from the accident which have left her unable to walk. After an initial stint in the hospital, Avery is permitted to take her home in a wheelchair where Juliette quickly becomes frustrated at her inability to care for Cadence and gets angry at her physiotherapist when she feels as if she isn't making enough progress regaining the use of her legs. She becomes determined to track down the woman who saved her life and eventually finds her singing in the choir at a nearby church. Hallie Jordan (Rhiannon Giddens) is at first confused by Juliette, who tries to show her gratitude through expensive gifts, but the two bond over their faith. When Luke sells Wheelin' Dealin' Records to Rayna, Juliette is signed to Highway 65. Juliette becomes more devoted to God following the crash and after moving from the chair to crutches, suggests the idea of recording a gospel album with the church's choir to Rayna, who agrees. When she broaches the idea with the choir however, there is initially some friction but Juliette eventually wins them over. Juliette and Avery go to the hospital where she explains to the doctor that her legs have been in a lot of pain and despite the doctor's assurances that this is normal and she should continue to put pressure on them, she insists for a scan to make sure. While waiting for the results, Juliette visits Rayna who has been rushed in following a car crash. Rayna tells Juliette how proud she is and remarks on how much she has changed since the two of them first met. Juliette's scan results report that there is no cause for concern, but the meeting with the doctor is interrupted when they find out Rayna has entered critical condition and is now in the ICU. Juliette and Avery rush to Rayna's side, with Juliette abandoning her crutches and running. She tells Rayna that she just wanted her to be proud of her. They stay for a while and provide support to Deacon and the girls but return home before Rayna passes away. Juliette always saw Rayna as a mother figure, even though they had their differences and were rivals in the past. Glenn is able to get Juliette to be a part of the tribute to Rayna at the CMT Awards, but when the time comes to perform she isn't comfortable with it, so she asks Maddie to take her place. The second half of the season sees Juliette attempt to go back to normal and regain her career and fame, however, radio only wants to work with Maddie. Her new Christian album has come out over a timejump, and it flops, so she wants to make another pop-country hit album. Juliette eventually goes to write with a songwriter who has a song she loves, but wants Juliette to give it to Maddie. She says she will, but evidently steals the song, which leads to country-music, family, and fan criticism and hatred. Eventually, Juliette drops out of the American Music Award she is nominated for, and tells the world what she did. She ponders why she has a darkness inside her and realizes she is doomed to make the same mistakes again and again. Juliette's mother has mentioned this darkness they shared in season 1 during the time Juliette came to visit her mother is rehab after detox. =Season 6= Juliette has been planning her new album launch which will kick off with a performance. She has been given a second chance at Highway 65 but audience members start holding up signs and booing her at her kickoff. She tells them off and explains that if they knew the real her they would not like her before walking off stage. During a trip away with Avery, she runs into Darius, who says he is someone on her journey. Juliette is awake at 2AM (Juliette has developed chronic insomnia, it's unclear if it was present before her pregnancy, but was mentioned that she suffered from sleeping issues in season 3), and finds a commercial of Darius talking about giving up addictions, and allowing access to your kingdom. Glenn tells Juliette that Darius tried to contact her at 2AM. She accuses Darius of stalking her, he refutes that it was fate; he recognizes the pain in her and wants to help her change her life. Juliette meets Darius who says he does not run a cult, but a way to help the mind. Juliette goes on radio, and announces she struggles with depression, and is cancelling her tour/album. Juliette eventually joins Darius' cult, which makes her stop wanting to sing. Unbeknownst to Juliette, the movement is a cult that uses and brainwashes people. Darius pushes Juliette to grow and has her do humanity projects. Everyone (mostly Avery) in Juliette's life tries to tell her they are worried about her and she is changing, but she doesn't believe them. She says she wants to be a new person. It is eventually revealed that Jolene used Juliette (around age 9)to sale her to older males for sex, committing a crime- child prostitution. This event might be the reason behind Juliette's dissociation because she did not remember the fill incident until Darius prompted the memory. Juliette disengages from the event, which leads to her pushing away from Avery. Darius tells Juliette the next step in their movement and his cult is outreach in Bolivia, to which Juliette ditches her family for. Avery tries to get her to come back but she refuses and says she's not herself anymore and loves it and does not care about him or Cadence. Avery eventually decides later on that his relationship is over with Juliette. During the cult storyline Juliette is not processing her trauma in healthy ways she is disengaging and redirecting. This method last until Juliette eventually comes back home when she finds the conditions bad and realizes who the cult is, motivated by a pregnancy revelation. She ends up quitting the music business and moves to a farm to raise Cadence, but promises Avery she's not running away. She hides the pregnancy from him for a few weeks after she tells him she loves him but she wants him to really want to be with her for the rest of their lives, not influenced by their new baby. A flash forward shows a visibly pregnant Juliette playing with Cadence, and Avery coming back to them, wanting to be with Juliette for the rest of their lives. Reception =Reviews= Panettiere has received critical acclaim for her role as Juliette. Sarah Hughes of The Guardian said that she \\"not only showcases a fine pair of lungs and a nice way with a one liner, she pulls off the rarer trick of making you sympathise with her character even when she's doing wrong.\\" Reviewing each episode of the series for The A.V. Club, Gwen Ihnat has come to regard Juliette as the series' lead character, and has consistently praised Panettiere for her performances, particularly for playing Juliette as \\"domineering, manipulative, in denial, and finally, achingly vulnerable... [rising] from a caricature to become one of the most interesting parts of the show.\\" She later noted that \\"every single week, Hayden Panettiere is the greatest thing about this show.\\" Deena Shanker of Salon has said that Panettiere's portrayal of Juliette has evolved to the point where she is a \\"feminist role model\\". Erin Carlson of The Hollywood Reporter has quipped that Panettiere should win the Michael Emerson prize for \\"Humanizing Terrible Characters on Network TV\\" after accomplishing what she felt the cast of Girls had not: rendering a \\"bitchy\\" character to be likeable and the series' \\"best\\", giving her \\"purpose, drive, grit and backbone\\". =Awards= Panettiere has been nominated for numerous awards for her role as Juliette: for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Television Series Drama in 2013 and 2014, a Satellite Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama in 2012, a Teen Choice Award for Television Actress: Drama in 2013 and 2015, a Prism Award for Female Performance in a Drama Series Multi-Episode Storyline in 2014, and a Critics' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016.

Their mission is to further the development of women's studies throughout the world through open dialogue and communication. Since its inception, NWSA has been the subject of controversy based on its failure to include marginalized women in the conversation. They offer two types of memberships including access to constituency groups, and various awards.  Founding  In 1973, women's studies pioneer Catharine R. Stimpson called for the founding of a national women's studies organization. Discussions took place over the next three years in women’s studies spaces. In 1976, Sybil Weir from San Jose State University called an official meeting for people interested in creating plans for a national organization. Following a grant from the Ford Foundation, the first NWSA conference was held in January 1977 at the University of San Francisco, co-sponsored by San Jose State University and the Santa Clara County Commission on the Status of Women. Over 500 people attended the three- day convention. According to Barbara W. Gerber, who served on NWSA's Coordinating Council, NWSA aimed to be inclusive of all women, with a subset of regional groups, and agreed upon a leadership group known as the Coordinating Council.  Mission  NWSA was formed to further the social, political, and professional development of women's studies throughout the world. The organization centers open dialogue and communication among women for positive social change and was founded upon the women's liberation movement. It promotes freedom from sexism, racism, homophobia, antisemitism, anti-Zionism, and from all suppressive ideologies and institutions. Its goals are to equip women to enter society and transform the world to one without systemic oppression.  Controversies  = Racism and classism = Women of color protested racism within the organization during its early years. During NWSA's 1981 conference in Storrs, Connecticut, poet Audre Lorde gave the keynote address admonishing conference-goers that if \\"women in the academy truly want a dialogue about racism, it will require recognizing the needs and living contexts of other women.\\" The 1981 conference was further criticized by Chela Sandoval for its classism, as travel fare and conference fees were difficult to afford. This coupled with the theme of racism caused attendance rates to suffer. The lack of inclusivity for women of color led to the Third World Women's Consciousness Raising group to discuss issues of racism and classism in NWSA. During the closing of the 1981 conference Barbara Smith, a member of the Combahee River Collective (CRC), asserted that for all the white women within NWSA tired of hearing about racism, there were just as many women of color who were sick of experiencing it. She criticizes NWSA for the disconnect between their goals and actions by stating their definition of feminism fails at being inclusive of all women. Smith's work within the CRC argues not to separate race from class or sexual oppression because they are experienced simultaneously. Former NWSA president Beverly Guy-Sheftall noted, \\"I wanted NWSA to be an inclusive, multiracial, multicultural organization where women of color and their feminisms would not be marginalized.\\" Led by feminists like Guy-Sheftall, NWSA has worked to center intersectionality in its institutional practices and leadership structure with the support of a Ford Foundation grant. = Lesbian separatism = During the 1977 conference, lesbians spoke about their invisibility in NWSA. Lesbians during this time were combating internal and external homophobia along with their racist and classist issues. This birthed the Lesbian Women's Caucus which sought to address issues of homophobia from within the organization and the media. = Anti-Zionism = In 2015, the NWSA membership voted to \\"back the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement against Israel.\\" In response to critiques of antisemitism following their support of member Jasbir K. Puar, NWSA responded by stating the organization holds firm in their conviction.  Membership  NWSA offers two types of memberships which vary in price based on employment, income, and student status. The National Women’s Studies Association held its annual conference. The conference that was held in November year of 2013. The conference was called “ Negotiating Points of Encounter”. The conference focused on sub themes such as “the sacred and profane”, “border and margins”, “futures of the feminist past”, and “body politics”. = Individual = Individuals members can find colleagues in the member directory, present at the annual conference, receive reduced registration rates, apply for scholarships and conference grants, apply for NWSA awards and prizes, and participate in the discussion forums.Benefits of being an individual membership include being able to be a representation member and have the ability to discuss ideas. = Institutional = Institutions can list their program, department, or nonprofit organization in the public member directory, receive three complimentary student memberships annually, post employment listings related to women's studies, and participate in the discussion forum. = Constituency groups= NWSA membership offers the ability to join several constituency groups, including: Caucuses * Aging and Ageism Caucus * Community College Caucus * Feminist Mothering Caucus * Girls and Girls Studies Caucus * Graduate Student Caucus * Indigenous Peoples Caucus * Jewish Caucus * Lesbian Caucus * North American Asian Feminist Collective * Queer and Trans People of Color Caucus * South Asian Feminist Caucus * Trans/Gender-Variant Caucus * Transnational Feminisms Caucus * Undergraduate Student Caucus * Women of Color Caucus Interest groups * Animal Studies/Animal Ethics Interest Group * Arts and Performance Interest Group * Asexuality Studies Interest Group * Confronting Campus Sexual Assault * Contingent Faculty Interest Group * Disabilities Studies Interest Group * Distance Education Interest Group * Early Modern Women Interest Group * Fat Studies Interest Group * Feminism and Activism Interest Group * Feminist Masculinities Interest Group * Feminist Media Studies Interest Group * Feminist Pedagogy Interest Group * Feminist Spirituality Interest Group * Feminists for Justice In/For Palestine * Gender, Women's, and Feminist Studies (GWFS) PhD Interest Group * Law and Public Policy Interest Group * Publishing Feminisms Interest Group * Reproductive Justice Interest Group * Third Wave Feminisms Interest Group Task forces * Anti White Supremacy Task Force * International Task Force * Librarians Task Force * Science and Technology Task Force * Social Justice Education Task Force  Journal  NWSA publishes Feminist Formations, a journal that cultivates feminist conversations from around the world regarding research, theory, activism, teaching, and learning.

It played an important role in showing experimental work of the era as well as supporting the careers of young artists in Los Angeles. Founding LAICA's primary mission was to support contemporary artists of the area through a democratic organizational structure that responded to a large and diverse but then-underrepresented local arts community. To minimize operating expenses and remain flexible to the shifting arts population, LAICA's directors chose not to establish a permanent collection and eschewed expensive exhibition venues in order to prioritize the needs of artists over those of dealers and curators.Gwen L. Allen, \\"Experiments in Print: A Survey of Los Angeles Artists' Magazines from 1955 to 1986,\\" East of Borneo (February 6, 2012). :The Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art is a new concept designed to be a catalyst for the support and recognition of contemporary art in Southern California. [...] An exhibition program reflecting many concepts of high artistic achievement uses visiting curators from all sectors of the community and open, depoliticized selection processes.Editorial statement, LAICA Journal 1 no. 1 (June 1974). Quoted in Allen. LAICA's Board of Directors included notable artists, art critics and gallery owners, including John Baldessari, Rosamund Felsen and Peter Plagens. Committees specifically in charge of exhibition programming were member-elected, and the duties of curator and editor (of the exhibition space and journal, respectively) rotated among members instead of belonging to permanent staff.Barbara Isenberg, \\"Ousted LAICA seeks new facilities\\" Los Angeles Times (Nov 22, 1976). Exhibition Venues The organization began in 1971 with a registry of slides and biographical materials open to submission by any artist of Southern California. LAICA opened its first exhibition space in Fall 1974 with a 4,200 square feet area on the fifth floor of the ABC Entertainment Complex in Century City, an unbuilt-out space that they were able to rent for $1.00 a year.Oral history interview with Joni Gordon, 2002 July 8-Sept 23, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution. http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-joni- gordon-12888 Earlier, in June of the same year, LAICA also released the first issue of LAICA Journal. Exhibitions at LAICA's exhibition space covered a wide variety of media, from contemporary painting and sculpture to performance art, video and music. Exhibitions at this space included Three L.A. Sculptors: Lloyd Hamrol, George Herms, and Bruce Nauman in 1975 and Imagination in 1976, which was curated by Llyn Foulkes.Pacific Standard Time at the Getty: Explore the Era, s.v. Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, 1974-1977. http://blogs.getty.edu/pacificstandardtime/explore-the-era/locations/the-los- angeles-institute-of-contemporary-art-laica-1974%E2%80%9377/ In 1976, LAICA lost the lease to their Century City location. By March 1977 they reopened in 2020 South Robertson Boulevard in an 8000 square foot location. Continuing its mission to showcase a wide range of contemporary art practices, both local and international, exhibitions here included a west coast showing of the groundbreaking exhibition PIctures (1978-1979), curated by Douglas Crimp, as well as Mike Mandel and Larry Sultan's Evidence, and solo shows by artists such as Eleanor Antin and Suzanne Lacy.Catherine Grenier, Catalog L.A.: Birth of an Art Capital (Chronicle Books, 2007). And Pacific Standard Time at the Getty: Explore the Era, s.v. Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art, 1977-1987. LAICA Journal LAICA's cofounders saw the publication of a journal as pivotal to their mission of supporting experimental artistic practices, seeing print as an alternative form of distribution that supported or even replaced the goals of their exhibition space. In fact, LAICA began the Journal before opening their exhibition space.Allen. LAICA cofounder Robert Smith recalled an early meeting with local artists in which Billy Al Bengston reportedly noted, \\"We don't need another gallery. What we need is a magazine.\\"Harriet Staff, \\"What We Need Are These Early Experimental Art Magazines From the West,\\" Poetry Foundation Blog. As Smith and former Artforum critic Fidel Danieli began the Journal, they focused its pages on the history and identity of the Los Angeles artistic community, publishing writings and works by local artists such as Guy de Cointet, Rachel Rosenthal, Allan Kaprow, Allan Sekula, Martha Rosler and Judy Chicago. Articles and issues often focused on negotiating the region; for example, Joni Gordon published \\"ARTFROM,\\" a chart of Los Angeles galleries from 1963 - 1974, in the Journal's first issue; and Eleanor Antin guest-edited the fourth issue, centering its contents as answers to the question of why artists choose to move or stay in the region, when it was not a center of the international art world (as was New York City). Closing In the late 1970s, LAICA was flourishing with an increased budget and staff, opening a second space at 815 Traction Avenue—the \\"Downtown Gallery\\"—and an additional storefront space in the Eastern Columbia building, donated by state Senator Alan Sieroty. However, the decrease in public funding for the art in the early 1980s forced LAICA to cut some of its public programs, though it continued to present ambitious exhibitions. In early 1985, Robert Smith resigned from his director position, which he had held since LAICA's founding.Suzanne Muchnic, \\"Institute at a Crossroads: Artists Have their Say on LAICA,\\" Los Angeles Times (February 27, 1985). The directors replaced Smith with Ben Marks, the former director of the Center for Contemporary Art in Seattle;Zan Dubin, \\"A New Star is Born at LAICA,\\" Los Angeles Times (January 14, 1986). however, he resigned less than a year later. At the same time, forced by financial burdens, LAICA's Board of Directors decided to sell the space on South Robertson Boulevard. They staged temporary exhibitions in various locations for the next two years, but finally closed in 1987.

It was Remington's first gas operated shotgun and was marketed alongside the recoil operated Model 11-48. The Model 58 was manufactured in 12, 16, and 20 gauge from 1956 to 1963, until it was replaced by the Model 1100.  Design  Being Remington's first gas operated shotgun, the Model 58 suffered from many design shortcomings compared to the contemporary Model 11-48 with which it shared many design features and parts. The gas system was built into the front of the magazine and therefore limited capacity of the tube magazine to two shells. Gas was tapped from a hole in the barrel into a large chamber. A piston in this chamber drove an action bar rearward which, in turn, operated the bolt to cycle the action. The action spring was also located inside the forward end of the magazine tube. The Model 58 was produced in several version and grades, including a magnum version which could accept shells, and versions with rifle sights (\\"Rifled Slug Specials\\"). The Model 878 was introduced in 1959 with an improved \\"self-adjusting\\" gas system, offered in 12 gauge only. The Model 58 and Model 878 are virtually the same, with only differences in the gas piston and cosmetics. The design proved more expensive to make than the Model 11-48, and was also less reliable and heavier. Remington chose to replace the Model 58 with a model that combined its best features with those of the Model 11-48. The resulting Model 1100 immediately replaced the Model 58 and proved so successful that it soon also replaced the Model 11-48.

Formed in 2009, the group consists of brothers Camron and Brayden Ward, Tim Hatch and Lauren Curtius. All members are multi-instrumentalists and play guitar, bass and drums. They are known for switching between instruments often during live performances. Their garage rock soundhttp://www.buzzbands.la/2012/01/05/ears-wide-open-the-lovely-bad-things/ has been called everything from proto-punk to surf punk. Because of the boy- girl vocals, music writers oftentimes bring up the Pixies.

History  The Lovely Bad Things formed in October 2009 after Camron and Brayden Ward's band had broken up. They paired up with longtime friends Lauren Curtius and Tim Hatch who were also between bands. The band's name was derived from the Mary Downing Hahn book \\"All The Lovely Bad Ones\\" and a computer glitch or typo. Camron Ward explains in a 2011 OC Weekly interview with Taylor Hamby:http://www.ocweekly.com/2011-12-01/music/locals-only-lovely-bad- things/full/ I was at Borders (Books),rest in peace,and I walked over to the children's section. There were all these Halloween books out, and there was one called All the Lovely Bad Ones. It's about ghosts -we all really should read it at some point— and we were all sitting on the porch, and we were like, \\"We need to think of a name,\\" and I said, \\"Well, I really liked this book. It might be a good band name.\\" They were like, \\"Yeah, that's cool.\\" All of our old recordings were done on a video camera, and we just ripped the audio off the video. [When we uploaded the video], the folder on the computer was titled Lovely Bad Things. Deeply involved in the DIY music movement, the group has played in small and large venues and when no gigs were available created house shows at their rehearsal garage space they named http://lo-pie.com/interview- the-lovely-bad-things/ The Lovely Bad Pad. The first songs, all reflecting a raw surf punk / punk sound, like Kevin, Cocaine Werewolf Super Awesome Fun Time, Ugly Kids and Cult Life, were written quickly http://first- avenue.com/performer/lovely-bad-things and would eventually end up on their first cassette offering entitled Shark Week which was first released (Dec. 2010) on the now defunct UVR label http://uvrecords.tumblr.com/ and then later picked up by Burger Records. That same year they would share the stage with bands such as Screaming Females, Audacity, The So So Glos, The Garden, La Sera, and Ty Segall and (in 2011) lent tour support for http://peterbjornandjohn.com/blog/2011/08/gimme-some-support-bands/Peter Bjorn and John (All You Can Eat Tour).

Originally trained on the flat in France he was later transferred to England where he excelled in hurdle races. In 2001 he was arguably the best hurdler in Britain, winning the Tote Gold Trophy, Championship Hurdle (a substitute Champion Hurdle), Fighting Fifth Hurdle and Christmas Hurdle. He failed to reproduce his best form in subsequent National Hunt campaigns, but returned to the flat as an eight-year-old in 2003 and won the Cesarewitch Handicap on his final racecourse appearance. Background Landing Light was a bay horse with a white star bred in Ireland by the Ballymacoll Stud. He was sired by In The Wings, the British-bred, French-trained winner of the 1990 Breeders' Cup Turf. As a breeding stallion, his other progeny included the multiple Group One winner Singspiel and the outstanding long distance hurdler Inglis Drever. His dam Gay Hellene was a successful racemare who won the Prix de Flore and was rated 111 by Timeform in 1985. Gay Hellene was a daughter of the Irish 1,000 Guineas winner Gaily, whose other descendants have included Pilsudski Landing Light was sent into training with Roger Charlton at Beckhampton, but was transferred to the stable of David Smaga in France before his racecourse debut. Racing career =1998: three-year-old season= Landing Light contested four races as a three-year-old in France in 1998, ridden on each occasion by Dominique Boeuf. After finishing second on his racecourse debut at Chantilly Racecourse on 3 May he recorded his first victory at Maisons- Laffitte Racecourse in June staying on in the closing stage to win by a head from Musgrave over 2000 metres. He finished ninth in the Listed Prix Pelleas at Maisons-Laffitte later in June and did not reappear until October, when he finished seventh in the Listed Prix Vulcan at Saint-Cloud Racecourse =2000/2001 National Hunt season= Landing Light did not race in 1999 and was moved to the stable of Nicky Henderson at Upper Lambourn to be prepared for a career in National Hunt racing. He made his first appearance over obstacles in a novice hurdle at Wincanton Racecourse on 24 February 2000. Ridden by Mick Fitzgerald, he started at odds of 9/2 in a seventeen-runner field and won by six lengths from Salford Flyer. After this race he was sold privately to Mr and Mrs John Poynton. Having won his only previous hurdle race, Landing Light was no longer eligible to compete in novice events when the new season began in the autumn of 2000 and had to race against much more experienced opponents. In December, he started 2/1 second favourite for the Knights Royal Hurdle at Ascot Racecourse and finished third, twenty lengths behind the French-bred Valiramix. On 27 January, he carried a weight of 154 pounds in the Letheby & Christopher Hurdle at Cheltenham Racecourse and started 6/1 second favourite against sixteen opponents. He was restrained by Fitzgerald in the early stages before moving up to take the lead approaching the last hurdle. He stayed on well in the closing stages to win by six lengths from La Landiere. Henderson praised Fitzgerald for giving the horse \\"a very good educational ride\\" but some observers criticised the winner for his tendency to carry his head at a high angle. Two weeks later he was made 4/1 favourite for the Grade III Tote Gold Trophy, the most valuable handicap hurdle in Europe at Newbury Racecourse in which he carried 142 pounds. Fitzgerald repeated the tactics employed at Cheltenham, holding the gelding up in the early stages before moving up to take the lead after the second last and won by three lengths from Rooster Booster. The 2001 Cheltenham Festival was postponed and then cancelled owing to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. Landing Light reappeared at the Grand National meeting at Aintree Racecourse in April but ran very poorly and was pulled up before the second last in the Aintree Hurdle which was won by Barton. At the end of April Sandown Racecourse staged a series of races intended as substitutes for the major races lost as a result Cheltenham's cancellation including the Grade I Championship Hurdle, a substitute for the Champion Hurdle. As Mick Fitzgerald opted to ride Geos, Richard Johnson took the ride on Landing Light, who started a 12/1 outsider in a field of nine which also included Barton, Valiramix, Hors La Loi III and the French-trained favourite Bilboa. The race's status as a championship event was undermined by the lack of Irish challengers, notably Istabraq who had won the last three Champion Hurdles. In a change of tactics, Landing Light raced in second place behind Teaatral before taking the lead approaching the second last hurdle. He went clear of his rivals at the last and won by three lengths from Geos. =2001/2002 National Hunt season= On his first appearance of the new season, Landing Light was sent to Newcastle Racecourse on 1 December for the Fighting Fifth Hurdle which was then a Grade II race. Starting the 4/5 favourite, he took the lead at the second last and repelled the renewed challenge of The French Furze to win by a length. At the Boxing Day meeting at Kempton Park Racecourse he faced Bilboa, Hors La Loi III and Azertyuiop in the Grade I Christmas Hurdle. Starting the 5/4 favourite, he appeared to be struggling three hurdles out but rallied to take the lead at the next obstacle. He went clear of the field at the last and won by two and a half lengths from Bilboa, despite being eased down by Fitzgerald in the closing stages. On 12 March 2012, Landing Light made his first appearance at the Cheltenham Festival and started 100/30 third favourite behind Istabraq and Valiramix for the Champion Hurdle. After being hampered at the second last he stayed on in the closing stages but was never able to reach the lead and finished fifth, four lengths behind the winner Hors La Loi III. On his final appearance of the season he was sent to Ireland for the Grade I Punchestown Champion Hurdle on 26 April but ran poorly, finishing last of the six runners behind Davenport Milenium. =2002/2003 National Hunt season= Landing Light failed to win in four races during the 2002/2003 National Hunt season. On his seasonal debut in November he made no impact when finishing tailed off in last place behind Baracouda in the Ascot Hurdle. Three weeks later he produced his best effort of the season when he finished second to Rooster Booster, to whom he was conceding four pounds, in the Bula Hurdle at Cheltenham. He finished seventh behind Rooster Booster at level weights in the Champion Hurdle in March and fourth behind Deano's Beeno over three miles at Ascot in April. =2003: eight-year-old (flat) season= Henderson felt that Landing Light was \\"starting to get a bit tired of jumping and maybe a bit knowing\\" and decided to campaign the horse on the flat in 2003. Four and a half years after finishing unplaced at Saint-Cloud, Landing Light returned to flat racing at York Racecourse in May 2003. Assigned top weight of 140 pounds and ridden by Kieren Fallon, he started a 25/1 outsider for a handicap race over fourteen furlongs. He made steady progress in the straight to take the lead near the finish and won by half a length from the Michael Jarvis-trained Hambleden. The gelding was again given top weight of 140 pounds when he started at odds of 7/1 for the Ascot Stakes over two and a half miles at Royal Ascot and finished second of the twenty-seven runners behind Sindapour. On 28 June, Landing Light started the 9/2 favourite for the Northumberland Plate at Newcastle, but finished tenth behind Unleash. After a break of more than three and a half months, Landing Light returned in the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse in October. Ridden by the veteran Pat Eddery, who had never won the race, he carried 130 pounds and started at odds of 12/1 in a field of thirty-six runners. Eddery held the horse up in the early stages before moving forward three furlongs from the finish. He took the lead approaching the final furlong and won by two and a half lengths from the Scottish challenger Sun Bird. After the race, Eddery, who had already announced that he would retire at the end of the season, said \\"I'd tried to win it for the last 25 years and been placed in it quite a bit but never actually won it.

Shell Canada has proposed up to seven exploration wells within six exploration licenses over a four-year period from 2015 to 2019. Shell carried out a 3D Wide Azimuth seismic survey in 2013, and a seabed survey in the same offshore area in 2014. In June 2015, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency published their environmental assessment.

These six exploration licences cover an area of roughly 19,845 square kilometres. The areas are located offshore approximately 300 kilometres south of Halifax, Nova Scotia in water depths of 500-3500m. The purpose of the project is to find and confirm hydrocarbons in the deep water off the coast of Nova Scotia. Shell maintains a 50% working interest and is the operator of the exploration licenses, ConocoPhillips maintains a 30% and Suncor Energy a 20% non-operating interest in the joint venture.Shell press release Shell welcomes joint venture partners to offshore Nova Scotia project Shell Canada, News Release, 9 June 2014  Project components In 2013 Shell carried out a 3D wide azimuth seismic survey, the first time that such a survey was conducted offshore of Canada, covering 10,850 square kilometres of seismic data. Per Shell it \\"differed from traditional 2D or 3D offshore seismic programs in how many seismic boats were used and how they were configured\\".Shell press release Shell collects 3D Wide Azimuth seismic data offshore Canada Shell,21 October 2013 In 2014, Shell conducted a seabed survey in the same offshore area. It used Multi-beam echo sounder mounted to the hull of a single ship for the survey over a maximum of 20 days and the seabed sampling over about 10 days, acquiring multibeam echo sounder data, coring and drop camera imagery of selected seafloor features. The seabed survey was anticipated to take about 45 days from mobilization to demobilization. The seabed survey aimed to identify potential surface hazards before drilling to avoid or prepare for them. Hazards on or within the first few hundred metres below the seafloor include pipelines, wrecks, telecommunications cables, geological features such as deposits of gas hydrates or pockets of shallow gas, steep and/or unstable substrates and man-made or natural seabed obstructions. A desktop study was planned to provide an overview of the regional geology, utilizing 3D WAZ seismic data and the 2014 seabed survey data to provide a clearer picture of what is below the surface and to reduce subsurface risk. Pending regulatory approval, Shell planned to start exploratory drilling in the second half of 2015. Shell projected the following components: The mobile offshore drilling unit (MODU) i.e. a specialized drilling vessel designed for year-round operations in deep water will be the Stena IceMAX. Up to seven offshore exploration wells will be drilled over a four-year period from 2015 through 2019 in two separate drilling campaigns with up to three wells in the first phase and up to four wells in the second. An onshore supply base will be built. Offshore support vessels (OSVs) for re- supply and for on-site standby during drilling activities will be needed as well as helicopter support to transport crew and delivering light supplies and equipment.  Regulatory actions  As part of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act from 2012 the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency began an environmental impact statement in January 2014 which it completed in June 2015.Environmental Assessment Decision Statement of the Shelburne Basin Venture Exploration Drilling Project, Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, June 15, 2015 Shell's spill containment plan foresees a primary capping stack in place within 12 to 21 days after a blowout, which has been criticised by environmentalists. In the U.S. Shell must have a capping stack \\"on a vessel nearby on standby that must be deployed within 24 hours\\" for example at a drilling project in the Chukchi Sea in Alaska. As of September 2015, the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board had not made a decision. The Board has been criticised as being conflicted with interest, because one of its members, Douglas Gregory, worked three decades for Shell. The Canada- Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) approved the project on October 20, 2015.The Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board (CNSOPB) approved the project on October 20th 2015[1].  Environmental impacts considered by Shell Shell undertook acoustic modeling in association with both seismic and MBES to determine potential effects from sound propagation on marine mammals. Because of the narrow bandwidth and limited fan-out from the sides of the ship, and a review of scientific literature on marine mammal hearing, Shell concluded that no mitigation measures were needed. Shell had considered options for reducing impacts on marine mammals, such as conducting the survey early in the preferred weather window (May to July) to avoid the July to August period when marine mammals are most likely to be in the area, using a higher frequency (30 kHz) MBES system to minimize any acoustic impacts to marine mammals and sea turtles, and using marine mammal observers and fisheries liaison officers on the survey vessel to collect data on marine mammal sighting and behaviours. Shell plans to abandon the drilling areas immediately after the drilling or testing has taken place even if hydrocarbons are found, in accordance with the Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Drilling and Production Regulations. The drilled holes will be plugged with cement in order to prevent any leakage of subsurface compounds. These plugs are placed at varying depths in the well bore to separate and permanently isolate certain subsurface zones to prevent the escape of any subsurface fluids from the well. The drilled areas will be abandoned within seven to ten days of being exposed. As part of well abandonment, approval was sought to leave the wellhead in place. Where removal of the wellhead is required, the wellhead and associated equipment (casing) will be removed up to 1m below sea floor by using cutters. In case of a well blowout, Shell said it needed up to 21 days to cap the well and would deploy a capping stack from Scotland, South Africa, Singapore or Brazil.  Community and local engagement  = Suppliers = Shell hosted several supplier information sessions across the province of Nova Scotia in August 2013 to introduce the project and to engage interested regional suppliers. Shell shared information on employment and contracting opportunities, and on how businesses and individuals might be able to participate. Shell has met with many local businesses one-on-one in the Halifax and Calgary offices or at their facilities in Nova Scotia to understand their capabilities and explain how to make themselves eligible to compete for work on the project. Shell also met suppliers at the Nova Scotia Pavilion at the annual Offshore Technology Conference in Houston in May 2013. Shell is a member of the Maritimes Energy Association and has participated in the Association’s programs to reach their supply community members including speaking at the 2013 CORE Conference. Shell hosted supplier engagement sessions throughout the province.http://www.southqueenschamber.com/2013/08/14/shell-supplier- information-sessions-shelburne-basin-exploration- program/http://www.capebretonpost.com/Business/2013-08-13/article-3349377/Shell- invites-suppliers-to-session-on-Shelburne-Basin-project/1 =First Nations= The Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency or the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Board require consultation whenever a project may adversely affect potential or established Aboriginal or Treaty Rights. Shell plans to work with the Mi’kmaq Nations of Nova Scotia, the Mi’kmaq and Maliseet Nations of New Brunswick, and the Native Council of Nova Scotia to understand traditional and commercial use of the project area and incorporate that knowledge where feasible in future planning. The Mi’kmaq First Nations of Nova Scotia consist of 13 bands, 12 of which are represented by the Kwilmu’kw Maw- Klusuuaqn Negotiation Office (KMKNO) with regards to consultation among other functions. The Shubenacadie/Indian Brook Mi’kmaq Nation has separated from the KMKNO governance with regards to consultation but may work with the remaining bands via the KMKNO on other matters as is a Right of any Nation in the KMKNO. In Nova Scotia, consultation with the Mi’kmaq is the duty of the Crown. Shell supports these consultations and provides information for the Mi’kmaq for its projects, as it deems appropriate. Shell consulted and shared information with the Nova Scotia First Nations. Besides these Nova Scotia First Nations, three First Nations in New Brunswick were also identified by the Agency as having interest in and around the project area and were involved in the assessment. The Maritimes Aboriginal Peoples Council via the Native Council of Nova Scotia has been engaged with the Agency and Shell. The above Aboriginal parties and their representatives identified that some areas surrounding the project are used for commercial and food/social/ ceremonial fishing (offshore and nearshore respectively).  History of Shell in Canada  Shell Canada Limited is the subsidiary of Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch Shell Plc and one of Canada's largest integrated oil companies. Shell has been active in Canada since 1911 and is now one of the country’s largest integrated oil and gas companies. Headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Shell Canada employs more than 8,000 people across Canada and has over 1,300 Shell branded retail stations in the country. = Nova Scotia = Nova Scotia’s offshore industry includes oil and natural gas. Shell has operated offshore Nova Scotia since 1963, when it filed for nearly 20 million acres of Federal permits. It participated in 77 or one third of the nearly 200 wells drilled offshore Nova Scotia to date and drilled Nova Scotia’s first offshore gas discovery well, Onondaga E-84, in 1969. In 1970, Shell introduced the first offshore oil rig, a semi-submersible Sedco-H made at the Halifax shipyards. Through the early 1970s, Shell drilled 24 wells, making a second discovery at Primrose in 1972 and continued an active exploration program throughout the 1980s. In addition to drilling the first deepwater well offshore Nova Scotia (Shubenacadie H-100), Shell made a number of new gas discoveries (Glenelg, Alma, North Triumph) which led to the development of the Sable Offshore Energy Project, which it owns at 31.3 percent. The project started producing gas on December 31, 1999 and Shell has been a non-operating co-venturer. In 1986 Shell drilled at Panuke discovering light sweet crude oil. While the company was not interested in developing what was thought to be a marginal discovery, it led to the development of Canada’s first offshore oil project, the decommissioned Cohasset-Panuke project, which produced a total of 44.5 million barrels between 1992 and 1999 from 16 wells. = Local office = In April 2013, Shell opened an office in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In 2013 it included Shell’s East Coast Operations Manager, a Health, Safety and Environment Manager and an Office Manager and in 2014, Shell added a local benefits manager responsible for local procurement and benefits.

It is located at the Adams County Courthouse in Decatur, Indiana in the United States. It is a war memorial devoted to peace, active women in the American Civil War, and as a general war memorial celebrating the sacrifice of soldiers in war. Peace Monument is the first monument in the United States specifically devoted to Peace. Description Peace Monument is made of Indiana limestone and metal. It is a cenotaph. The front of the piece features an allegory of Peace. It is represented as a woman. She stands to the proper left. She wears armor. Her hair is in a bun. In her proper left hand she wields a shield representing the United States. She holds it in front of herself, and it sits on the ground in front of her feet. Her right arm is outstretched in front of her. It sits upon a laurel twig. The twig sits upon four furled flags. The flags lay across the top of the cenotaph, centered. She has a sword, which rests in a scabbard, strapped to her proper left side, just behind the shield. Bronze panels on either side of Peace include the names of 1,276 veterans from Adams County. The back side of the cenotaph has the words inscribed: :TO THE GLORY OF OUR COUNTRY :AND IN LOVING MEMORY OF :OUR SOLDIER HEROS :TO THE WOMEN OF OUR NATION :AS A TRIBUTE TO THEIR :COURAGE DEVOTION AND SACRIFICE The back of the cenotaph features a relief. The relief depicts a nurse treating a wounded soldier. The cenotaph used to house a fountain, which poured into a trough just beneath the relief. Near the relief, is a metal tablet that is installed on the cenotaph. The metal was taken from USS Maine. The plaque has the words IN MEMORIAM/U.S.S. MAINE inscribed on it. The plaque was unearthed in 2008, during a restoration project by the county. There is a bench at the cenotaph base, on which the cenotaph resides. Two urns are placed in front of the cenotaph, for plantings, they sit in front of Peace. Acquisition The development for the sculpture was started by historian French Quinn. Quinn headed up the placing of flowers on veterans graves during Decoration Day. Quinn wrote an editorial in the Decatur Daily Democrat called \\"Let's Build a Soldiers Monument\\". Quinn demanded that funds be raised to build a war memorial. The result was a property tax program, supported by the Grand Army of the Republic, that helped raise the funds. The tax was 7 cents for every $100 paid. The piece was created between 1912 and 1913. Installation began in July, 1913. Development of the piece was led by Sam Henry Post, who was from the Grand Army of the Republic, and John H. Heller. The county contributed $10,000 for the piece to be created. Delays in the finalization of the work pushed the dedication back by two weeks. It was dedicated on October 30, 1913. State Governor Samuel M. Ralston attended the ceremony. Information Margaret McMasters Van Slyke with the Peace Monument circa 1913. The idea for the monument was first brought to the Art Institute of Chicago, who suggested that Quinn and the city talk to Charles Mulligan. Mulligan became the sculptor for the piece. It was carved by Charles Dodd. George Wemhoff of Wemhoff Monument Works engineered and his company fabricated and installed it. The cenotaph is a general war memorial, with special focus on the importance of peace and the role of women in the American Civil War. Specifically, the piece memorializes the Civil War, the Mexican–American War, the Spanish–American War, and the American Revolution. The quarry used to supply the Indiana limestone for the piece, was the same that supplied the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2013, the county celebrated the 100th anniversary of Peace Monument. A re-dedication ceremony was held at the site. =Margaret McMasters Van Slyke= The model for Peace, was Margaret McMasters Van Slyke, who was from Chicago, Illinois. Circa 1904, Van Slyke was named the \\"best and most perfectly formed woman\\" by Bernarr Macfadden. Van Slyke was described as having a \\"fascinating type of beauty so often spoken of as Grecian...\\" Condition The sculpture went through conservation and was cleaned and coated with sealant in 1991, by JRS Builders. The piece was surveyed by the Save Outdoor Sculpture! program in 1993. It was described, as of August of that year, as needing treatment. In the late 1990s, portions of the cenotaph were repaired. In 2008, bronze plaques were resealed. During the 2013 centennial celebration, the county aimed to raise $40,000 in order to restore the monument. Funds would also support the inscription of veterans from the county that served after 1913.

Plot Pat Fairlie is out of the Navy now and travels to Jamaica to renew acquaintance with Ena Dacey, an old flame. Ena lives on a stately sugar plantation with her brother, Todd, and their mother. Land baron Montague comes to collect the rent. The mother speaks arrogantly about the family's wealth. In reality, the Daceys have financial woes, but pay a mere one pound per year to lease the place, due to a long-ago bargain made after documents proving the rightful owner's purchase were lost at sea. Montague comes to Pat with a proposition. He believes the chest containing the documents can be recovered from the ocean floor and wants Pat to be his diver. Janice and Robert Clayton have put in claims to Montague that the property should be legally theirs. Pat refuses to help, but Montague explains that some other diver will, so Pat might as well be there to look out for his Ena's family interests. Mysterious events begin to occur. Todd appears to fall in love with Janice, but when she nearly drowns until Pat rescues her, Todd's behavior seems suspicious. Robert is then found by Pat, dead on the ocean floor. Inspector Mole of the island police arrives to investigate and soon concludes it's not an accident but a murder. A treasure chest is found, presumably containing the vital documents. After an attempt on Pat's life, he and Ena do some investigative work on their own. They find an antique dealer who recently sold such a chest to a customer. Montague is identified as the culprit, trying to pull an elaborate land swindle using forged documents.

Inspired by craft and decoration, Morris explores the idiosyncrasy and imperfection of the artist’s hand. \\"I was always interested in creating systems and plan-type drawings.\\" she said in a 2014 interview. \\"As a child, I drew floor plans of split-level houses, and plans for cities and towns. I also drew imaginary family trees, which were based on a grid-like system, but they featured cat families instead of people families.\\" Morris avoids describing subject matter as she does not want to dictate what interpretations her painted forms may elicit. Some of her influences are the physical space of her studio, Raoul De Keyser, Joan Mitchell, James Meyer, and Terry Riley. Some compositions are made working flat on the floor, and many include colors that suggest a kind of interior of overlapping paintings, objects, and arrangements of items on a wall. Her artistic practice has been likened to Laura Owens's free sense of historical reference, as well as Frank Stella and Richard Tuttle. Awards Morris is a recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship and has also received awards from The City of Los Angeles, Tiffany Foundation, The Durfee Foundation, Art Matters, and the Illinois Arts Council. Exhibitions Morris has exhibited at 2014 Whitney Biennial (New York), The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago, the Blaffer Art Museum at the University of Houston, Made in LA, Hammer Museum, The Kunstmuseum St. Gallen (Switzerland), Friedrich Petzel (New York), The Hessel Art Museum (New York), The Museum of Contemporary Art (Chicago), and Night Gallery (Los Angeles). She has shown with Mary Boone and Bortolami in New York.

Appearance Hypnodendron comosum var.comosum (left) and Hypnodendron comosum var. sieberi (right) Labeled features of Hypnodendron comosum var. sieberi The appearance for both varieties is similar with both sharing many of the same features. Resembling the trunk of the tree, the stems are elongated and narrow growing between 2–9 cm in length. They are black or brown in colour and covered in trichome hairs and small leaves. The stem reaches up to a green umbrella shaped arrangement of fronds at the top. The horizontally spreading fronds are shaped umbellate to pinnate and grow up to 5 cm in diameter. Each spreading frond forms many small branches each reaching 2–5 mm in length. This gives the umbrella shape a clumpy, palm-like look. The branch leaves are triangular-ovate and yellow-green in colour. The costa is green or brown and margins are serrate toward the tip.Anbg.gov.au. 2014. ABRS  Australian Mosses Online. http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/Mosses_online/ The sporophyte arises from the centre of the female gametophyte and forms a long seta on which a capsule is borne. H. comosum bares anywhere between 4–12 sporophytes. The seta is long and thin and reaches between 2–4 cm in length. The capsule is orange or brown in colour and reaches around 2–5 mm in length. They are cylindrical in shape. The operculum is the cap or covering to the spores, and once this falls off, the spores are passively dispersed via the peristome.Anbg.gov.au. 2014. ABRS  Australian Mosses Online. http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/Mosses_online/ While both species are similar, Hypnodendron comosum var. comosum is unique in that it is the smaller, more compact of the two. Most commonly located in Tasmania, its branches are compactly arranged, making this variety seem clumped and tightly packed. Located on mainland Australia, Hypnodendron comosum var. siberi is taller in form and the branches are much more loosely arranged.Anbg.gov.au. 2014. ABRS  Australian Mosses Online. http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/Mosses_online/ Physiology Like all bryophyte species, Hypnodendron species are non-vascular, meaning the vasculature or ducts within the tissues in which water, nutrients and sugars are transported around the plant are non existent.Raven, P. H., Evert, R. F. and Eichhorn, S. E. 2005. Biology of plants. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman. Bryophytes also lack true roots but are anchored to the substrate by rhizoids. Unlike vascular plants that use their roots to exchange gas and extract nutrients and water from the soil, bryophytes are able to do this over the leaf surface, depositing nutrients and water where they are required.Meagher, D. and Fuhrer, B. 2003. A Field Guide to Mosses and Allied Plants of Southern Australia. Melbourne: Australian Biological Resources Study and The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria.Raven, P. H., Evert, R.

Habitat This image shows the filtered amounts of light, distribution and other communities of moss and the different levels of understory. This is a rainforest located in Tasmania. Hypnodendron comosum community taken in Tasmania's wilderness The plant is commonly located in wet forests and rainforests consisting of moist humeric layerings with loamy soil composition. Favouring wet rocks, tree roots, the base of live trees and tree ferns, it is most commonly located in areas with large amounts of decaying logs and decomposing matter.Anbg.gov.au. 2014.

This species forms clumps like colonizing patterns in dry conditions and, when conditions are moist, H. comosum forms small forest mats with large numbers, indicating wetter environments are preferable.Frey, W. and Dalton, P. 1996.

Melbourne: Australian Biological Resources Study and The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria Geographical distribution Hypnodendron comosum is endemic to the Australian states of New South wales, Victoria, and Tasmania and to New Zealand, Stuart Island, and the Campbell Islands. Distribution of both varieties of Hypnodendron comosum, H. c. var. comosum and H. c. var. sieberi Since it is located in New Zealand as well as Australia, this indicates that the species predates Gondwanaland, suggesting that this species may be included as one of the earliest species to diverge from water to land and may give vital insight toward how vascular plants evolved.Anbg.gov.au. 2014.

H., Evert, R. F. and Eichhorn, S. E. 2005. Biology of plants. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman. Hypnodendron comosum var. sieberi is more commonly located on mainland Australia and the northern South Island of New Zealand, whereas H. c. var. comosum is more commonly located in Tasmania, the southern South Island of New Zealand, and the islands located in the southern ocean.Anbg.gov.au. 2014. ABRS  Australian Mosses Online. http://www.anbg.gov.au/abrs/Mosses_online/ Phylogeny Phylogenetic tree of Hypnodendron comosum Life cycle Like all mosses, Hypnodendron comosum has an alternation of generations. This means that there are two generations that exist in a full life cycle of this plant. Those generations are named the sporophyte stage and the gametophyte stage.Meagher, D. and Fuhrer, B. 2003. A Field Guide to Mosses and Allied Plants of Southern Australia. Melbourne: Australian Biological Resources Study and The Field Naturalists Club of Victoria. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event of the lifecycle and involves female and male gametangia. In this stage the antheridium fertilizes the haploid egg within the archegonia with haploid sperm producing a diploid zygote. This zygote then divides via mitosis and forms the sporophyte.Raven, P. H., Evert, R. F. and Eichhorn, S. E. 2005. Biology of plants. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman. The sporophyte stage is the spore- forming event of the lifecycle. Once the zygote has begun to enlarge, the seta elongates and develops a sporangium on the end in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of sporogenous tissue, a peristome to regulate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release.Raven, P. H., Evert, R. F. and Eichhorn, S. E. 2005. Biology of plants. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman. Once spores are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema develops buds which grow to become either a male or female gametophyte. The male gametophyte is named the antheridium and the female the archegonium. This is the gametophyte stage.Raven, P. H., Evert, R. F. and Eichhorn, S. E. 2005. Biology of plants. 7th ed. New York: W.H. Freeman.

Throughout his whole career Týfa designed hundreds of books. Upon the improvement and popularization of digital typography software, although familiar with traditional requirements on metal type, he quickly began to enjoy the technology, and adjusted his old designs to a more contemporary look. He died in Prague at the age of 93. Typefaces =Tyfa= \\"Tyfa\\" was designed in 1959 and first released in 1960 when a Czechoslovakian design competition was held to determine the best new Czech typeface for book composition. Týfa's \\"Tyfa\\" typeface was the winner and the design was made into fonts for the linotype machine and as a hand-set type by the Czech type foundry, Grafotechna (for hot metal typesetting). Berthold Type Foundry later produced letter matrices of the design for Staromat devices, used for manual phototypesetting of display alphabets. It was also available on dry transfers of Transotype in the 1980s. Although the design found immediate and continued popularity in Czechoslovakia, it saw little use elsewhere.Storm Type Foundry – Tyfa Fonts.com – ITC Tyfa The design was inspired by the work of architect Pier Luigi Nervi. ITC Tyfa 18 years after the publication of the original design Jan Solpera, another Czech type designer, sent a letter ITC suggesting that it should release Tyfa as an ITC font. ITC was unable to communicate with Týfa at the time due to existence of the \\"Iron Curtain\\". Týfa was willing to licence his design to ITC but could only provide his original sketches from the late 1950s, which were a set of signs on pieces of yellowing cardboard about B2 in size. In 1995 František Štorm approached Týfa, proposing to digitize his design under Týfa's direction. It was issued by ITC in 1998. Design Storm began digitizing the typeface under Týfa's direction and feels the design shows \\"a little touch of baroque typography\\". According to ITC, while it is possible to see the influences of older Czech designers such as Oldřich Menhart, ITC Týfa is a unique typeface with a distinctive character all its own and international appeal. The structure is considered neoclassical, with clear contrasts between thin and thick strokes and italics, other than the majuscule letters, differ largely in style from the regular characters. =Academia= Josef Týfa first published the Academia typeface in 1967–68. It was the winning design from competition aimed at new typeface for scientific texts, announced by Grafotechna. It was cut and cast in metal in 1968 in 8 and 10 point sizes of plain, italic and semi-bold designs. Digitization In 2003 Týfa began work with František Štorm on digitizing the typeface. As usual, Light and Black weight designs were used as starting points for the interpolation of the other weights. During 2004 Týfa approved a number of differences from the original typeset in order to bring the typeface more original and timeless feeling. Such differences were: * vertical stem outlines were softly slendered in the middle rather than being completely straight. * italics quietened * uppercase proportions brought closer to antique principle The new name, \\"Academica\\" distinguishes the present digital transcription from the original idea. It comprises Týfa’s initial concept to create a typeface for scientific application with versatility to other genres of literature.Storm Type Foundry – Academia =Juvenis= Juvenis is a contemporary typeface originally intended for children's literature. It was digitized by Josef Týfa and František Štorm in 2002 and conceived half a century ago. Despite its original purpose as a contemporary typeface for children's literature, it can now be applied to posters, periodicals and longer works. Distinguishing characteristics include a large x-height and semi-serifs on lower case letters.Storm Type Foundry – JuvenisEye Magazine  Feature  Storm: living history On Týfa's attitude during the making process Štorm said: \\"it would not be Josef Tyfa, if he did not redesign the entire alphabet, and to such an extent that all that has remained from the original was practically the name\\". =Other= * Kolektiv (1952), a transitional roman typeface designed with S.

The poffer was worn only by married women. It was fashionable between the 1860s and the 1920s. In contrast to Zeeland and the more northern parts of the Netherlands, in North Brabant and Limburg there was never any distinctive folkloric costume worn by either men or women, making the poffer the only folkloric garment in this part of the Netherlands.\\"De muts en de Poffer.\\" Binnekieke in Grootmoederstijd blog. Accessed in Dutch 16 March 2014.  Etymology and origin  The word poffer is derived from poffen, the puffing of sleeves and trousers worn in the mid-19th century.\\"Poffer\\" Vught Museum. The poffer evolved from a simple headdress, the paske (a strip of fabric decorated with narrow, pleated fabric) which was worn on a white hat. In Limburg the poffer is called a toer. Toer is a term derived from the French word, touronette. Touronette is akin to feminine finery but was originally a braid with ribbons and flowers.\\"Poffer\\" Deurnewiki.nl website. The poffer is not to be confused with the poffer-pan, used to make poffertjes.Rose P. \\"Food, drink and celebrations of the Hudson Valley Dutch.\\" The History Press 2009 p67 , 9781596295957. Accessed 18 March 2014.  Social history  Prior to 1900, the Brabant area was not prosperous due to poor sandy soil. With the introduction of fertilizer around 1860, the region's economy improved. This new wealth was reflected by an increase in the size of the poffer, which was at its largest size between about 1915 and 1920. The poffer was worn by those who could afford one: the wives of middle class men, richer farmers, officials and professionals, such as a mayor or doctor. The size and elegance of a woman's poffer reflected her husband's wealth. Men aspired to see their wives noticed in an elaborate poffer. Sometimes, the poffer was mockingly called a \\"meringue\\". In the first half of the 20th century, the poffer fell out of favour, largely because of its impracticality, especially when riding a bicycle. There was also a lack of fabric in the area during the second world war period. The wearing of the poffer continued until the 1950s but only on special occasions such as weddings, holidays and attending church during which it was replaced by more modern style hats.  Appearance  The poffer was a white tulle hat with a lace trim. It was decorated with pearls and white, gold, silver or glass beads called dew drops. It was also adorned with artificial flowers (or artificial fruit in case of older women) and four ribbons (lavaliers) of about 12 cm wide and 60 cm long which hung over the shoulders and the back. The breadth and quality of the ribbons indicated the wealth of the wearer. The details of the poffer varied from one area to another. The poffer was decorated with artificial flowers or fruits in pastel shades or brighter colors depending of the town's tradition. One could recognize the hometown of the wearer by its appearance and the age of the wearer by the decoration on the poffer. Flowers were for brides and younger married women. Older women decorated their poffer with silk apples, pears and buds.\\"Poffer en vrouwenmutsen in noord Brabant.\\" Museum Vekemans.  Regional variations  The poffer varied regionally in size, shape, colour and decoration. Women preferred the type of poffer from their home town. Even if a woman lived in another village afters married, she usually would still order her poffer from the poffer maker in her home village or town. The poffer had many different local names including: klein mutsje (little hat); koveltje (from little cowl or dormeuse); kempische muts (Campinian hat); kindermuts (children's hat); cornetmuts (from cornette hat); Eindhovense mutsje (Eindhovenian hat); drie-toerkes muts (three-touronettes hat); and, daagse muts (daily hat). The type of head garment was found in North Brabant, Limburg from Mook to Roermond and across the German border to just past Xanten. To the north, poffers were worn in southern Gelderland, for example, in Nijmegen and Bommelerwaard. The biggest poffer was worn in the Meierij, where it was worn towards the front of the head. To the east of Brabant and Limburg the poffer would be placed further back on the head. In eastern North Brabant, the poffer followed the shape of the head, like an arc. In western North Brabant, a pleated poffer was worn. Poffer or Brabantian Headdress, worn by woman in Beek (Beek en Donk), North Brabant, the Netherlands, 1931-05-18  Wearing the poffer  First, a black cap was worn to smooth the form and strengthen the shape of the head. This hat was worn at home when the woman was around an open fire. Next, a lace, tulle or gauze hat was worn. Then, the poffer was worn as an over-bonnet, either pinned to the hat at the front and or tied beneath the chin.Lewandowski E. \\"The complete costume dictionary.\\" Scarecrow Press, 2011 p233 , 9780810840041. To keep the soft fabric of the poffer in shape, starch with borax and white wax was used. The hat and poffer were detached for cleaning and washed in soft soap and then laid, still wet, on the grass to be bleached by the sun. Starch was used to keep the fabric from yellowing.  Occasion  Poffers for babies and young children were not made. Even so, a baby or young girl's bonnet could be decorated with gauze flowers and had ribbons for securing. Unmarried women did not wear a poffer. However, they did wear a black bonnet called a capotehoedje or kaphoedje. These were headdresses of a single black piece of fabric, adorned with four black ribbons and black artificial flowers. They were worn after a girl's first holy communion at about the age of twelve. = Mourning poffer = Traditionally, in the Netherlands, those in mourning wore dark clothes. In North Brabant and northern Limburg the shade of the day to day dress was also dark or black (also for weddings and other celebrations clothing was entirely black). Women in those areas therefore indicated their mourning state by wearing a special type of poffer: there would be no lace trim and no beads and few flowers. In a few villages in the Peel the mourning poffer could be all black or it was black and white, but these non-white poffers are rare exceptions. Generally a mourning poffer would be entirely white but without any or with only flower decorations. If the deceased was a more distant relative, an all white \\"half\\" mourning poffer with all white flower decorations but without beads and never with lace was worn.  Poffer makers  Once, each village had a poffer maker with their own distinct tradition, and the poffer maker would in detail consult the client how the design would look like and which fabrics would be used. A poffer took approximately sixty hours to make. Poffer makers were divided into three grades. In the lowest grade were women who cleaned, repaired and washed the poffers. The middle grade consisted of those who made new poffers. The upper ten designed the poffers and made high end articles. Poffer makers were often unmarried ladies with a physical impairment. For washing, starching, ironing and reassembling a poffer, a poffer maker received 9 cents. The price of an ordinary poffer was 35 guilders. A mourning poffer costed 15 guilders. A chic poffer with handmade lace and a new under hat costed approximately 100 guilders. The price depended on the amount of lace and the number of floral motifs. A special poffer could cost as much as 500 guilders. Usually, a farmer's wife had two or three poffers.  Conservation  Dutch ethnological museums have a number of poffers in their collections, and some North Brabantian museums have special collections, for example, the Museum van Brabantse mutsen en poffers in Sint-Oedenrode.\\"Poffer\\" Museum Demuts.\\"Brabantse mutsen museum.\\" Sintoedenrode blog. Poffers are worn during folkloric celebrations, especially at the boerenbruiloft (peasant wedding) during the carnaval. In 1996, on the occasion of the 200th anniversary of the province of North Brabant, a commemorative coin was issued which was called the poffer. It depicted a woman wearing a poffer. This coin was legal tender until 10 January 1997.\\"Eigen Brabants betaalmiddel.\\" Trouw.nl website 11 January 1996.

A retrospective exhibition of her work was organized in 2010 by the University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, and traveled to the ICA in Philadelphia, and the Luckman Gallery at California State University in Los Angeles. A monograph on her work was published by JRPRingier in conjunction with the show. Her award winning site-specific project “Visible Distance/Second Sight” was featured in the inaugural Desert Exhibition of Art, in 2017. Her recent exhibition at Pio Pico Gallery, Los Angeles, titled \\"The Composition of Decomposition,\\" included a new body of works taking the newspaper as a point of departure for photographs, film and sculptural works . Bolande earned a BFA from Nova Scotia College of Art & Design in 1979. She is a Professor in New Genres in the Department of Art at UCLA. She lives and works in LA and Joshua Tree, California.

Glen Spey distillery was built in 1878 by James Stuart & Co. under the name 'Mill of Rothes'. It actually started its life as an oatmeal mill - founder James Stuart was a corn merchant before he ventured into the whisky world. The distillation equipment was simply added to the existing mill in the years before the Glen Spey distillery was sold to the Gilbey company of London in 1887. It expanded production capacity from two to four stills in 1970. Glen Spey (along with Glenlossie and Strathmill) continues to use 'purifiers'. Purifiers act as small condensers, returning a proportion of the alcohol vapours back to the pot to be re-distilled. So, this would increase the amount of 'reflux' within the pot stills. This results in a lighter spirit. During its history, the distillery has released only a handful of official bottlings. The distillery's product is currently primarily used for J&B; products.

His father of the same name was also a painter, and sources often confuse the two. He was a collaborator and follower of Francesco and Ferdinando Galli Bibiena. In 1711, he was a scenic designer in Vienna for the court. He then labored in the Teatro San Cassiano in Le gare generose (1712) by Albinoni and Zaniboni; and for La verità nell'inganno (1713) by Gasparini and Silvani. He prepared scenography and was engineer for performances in Naples, including L'Amor generoso (1714) at the court theater attributed to Scarlatti.L'Amor generoso is attributed to Costanzi in List of works premiered at the Teatro Capranica In 1714 for the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples, he produced scenography for Scipione nella Spagna also by Scarlatti; Pisistrato by Leonardo Leo; Vincislao by Mancini and Apostolo Zeno; Arminio by Scarlatti and Nicola Serino; and Tigrane ovvero L'egual impegno d'amore e di fede, by Scarlatti and Domenico Lolli. In 1716-1719, he worked in England: initially at the King's Theatre and after 1719 as decorator and machinist at the Royal Academy of Music.

She has worked in collage and installation. Biography Smith's father was a psychiatrist and she spent her childhood years living first on a citrus grove in Covina, California and then on the grounds of a mental hospital. \\"It was just off enough to be affecting,\\" she later stated, \\"it had that edge of nonreality, of literal craziness\\". As a girl Smith created collages by cutting up and combining words and images. It was only later that friends encouraged her to take art classes. She studied with Vija Celmins and Robert Irwin at UC Irvine, receiving her B.A. in 1970. In college, she impulsively changed her name to Alexis Smith, the name of the Hollywood actress of the 1940s and 1950s, and who won a Tony award in the 1970s. She is married to artist Scott Grieger. Artistic Style Since the 1970s, Smith has produced collages, artist's books, and gallery installations that combine found objects, images, and texts. Her collages from the early and mid-1980s focus on entertainment and leisure, while those made from the mid-90s to the early 2000s focus on fashion and commerce. Smith combines text and imagery from a variety of sources to explore the psychology of the American identity. She has drawn elements for her collages from pop culture, movies, romance novels, magazines, and advertising, as well as the fiction and nonfiction works of a wide range of writers including Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Thomas Mann, and Raymond Chandler. Hollywood stories, the celebrity culture, advertisements, and Hollywood memorabilia figure frequently in her work, in part due to her upbringing in Los Angeles. To Smith Hollywood is a place fraught with symbols and redolent with possibility, which engenders a different concept of art than that on the East Coast The objects used in Smith's works are commonly found on the street, at garage sales, thrift stores, and swap meets, and via gifts and chance encounters. On her approach to collage, Smith has stated, \\"there’s a kind of symbiosis to it—the things, the words, the background, and the objects. It's fused into a whole where they seem like they’ve always been together, or were meant to be together. The people that look at them put them together in their heads\\". Her approach to collage utilizes a mixture of literacy with a conceptual point of view. In addition to collages, Smith also creates gallery installations, which have been described as addressing the glut of imagery that characterizes contemporary life. Large-scale public works include Snake Path (1992), a 560-foot-long inlaid slate path for the Stuart Collection at UC San Diego, terrazzo floors for the Los Angeles Convention Center and the Schottenstein Sports Arena at Ohio State University, and a multimedia collage installation \\"Taste\\" in the Restaurant at the Getty Center. Snake Path makes several references to biblical conflict between innocence and knowledge as the installation is a footpath in the form of a serpent surrounding a \\"garden of Eden\\". Additionally, there are quotes from Thomas Gray and Milton's Paradise Lost. Through works like Snake Path, Smith attempts to reevaluate the ideological formation of mass culture and the use of so-called classical knowledge. Smith's art can be seen as part of the tradition of California assemblage. Her work has also been compared to that of Barbara Kruger for its use of language, and to Joseph Cornell and Betye Saar for its combinatory aesthetic. Smith's work is characterized by humor, irony, poignancy, and a deliberately open-ended message. Her Hell on Wheels from 1985, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, demonstrates her approach to assemblage as well as her humorous and ironic titles. Exhibitions Smith's work has been exhibited at major museums including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Walker Art Center, and the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. She has collaborated with Poet Amy Gerstler on several installations, including \\"Past Lives\\" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art.Smith, Alexis, and Amy Gertsler. \\"Alexis Smith and Amy Gertsler.\\" Art Journal 52, no. 4 (1993): 75–74. Accessed 24 August 2020. doi:10.2307/777631. \\"Second Nature\\" was an exhibition of Smith's work at the Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica, California in 2013. In the exhibition, Smith explored how the concepts of wisdom and innocence are not in opposition as they are presented as in the biblical story of the Garden of Eden. The majority of Smith's work in this exhibit consist of a landscape portrait painted by an amateur with romantic subjects in the scenes of sailing ships, forests, tropical islands, desert sunsets, bridges, barns, and city streets. Smith also includes one or two small items such as a ruler, straw hat, crushed beer can, or key chain in most of these works in order to contradict the setting of the painting. There are also quotes by Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau printed on the gallery walls which further speak to the subject matter of Smith's paintings. In a 2015 exhibition at Garth Greenan Gallery located in lower Manhattan, Smith's works were presented for the first time in a New York gallery in over a decade. The exhibition was an overview of Smith's work from 1994 to 2015. Smith examined American culture of the 1940s and 1950s by combining images and texts from the time period such as postcards, road maps, movie stills, and advertising art into witty statements. A common theme in her works is the city of Los Angeles. Smith acknowledges the fascination surrounding Hollywood as a place where people believe dreams come true in order to comment on the illusion of the quintessential American transformation myth which is also known as the American Dream. Since this exhibit, the Garth Greenan Gallery has held three more exhibitions of Alexis Smith's works in 2018 and 2019. Collections Smith's works are in the permanent collections of numerous arts institutions, including the Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, National Gallery of Art, Getty Research Institute, and Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

It has been described as causing human disease, but is generally found as a non-pathogenic organism in human stools. History C. sedlakii was originally isolated from human stool and wounds as strains of Citrobacter freundii. However, in 1993 six strains of C. freundii were identified as a separate species based on DNA hybridization, and were named C. sedlakii to honor Czech microbiologist Jiri Sedlak. Description C. sedlakii is a rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium. It can be distinguished from other Citrobacter species by its ability to produce indole, arginine dihydrolase activity, and ornithine decarboxylase activity. Role in disease C. sedlakii was originally isolated from human stool and wounds and was suggested to be pathogenic in humans. While some reports have described C. sedlakii as causing illness in humans, it is frequently found in stool and is not thought to be pathogenic in most cases. C. sedlakii can express the O157 antigen which is commonly found on pathogenic E. coli, however this does not cause disease.

She is famous for being an activist of the opposition to President Vladimir Putin and, in particular, for having organized the Bolotnaya Square protests on May 6, 2012. In February 2019, she joined Russian government television network RT to work on a charity project. Several newspapers, including The New Republic and Rolling Stone magazine, have praised her activist work, noting her fortitude in supporting Russia's opposition movement. Reuters journalist Lucian Kim described her as embodying “the contradictions of Russians who love their country, warts and all, and seek to reconcile it with the rest of the world.” Early life and education Baronova (née Tchebotareva) describes herself as having been born in “Orwell's year,” 1984\\\\. The Hez family consisted mostly of politically inactive members who never partook in activism. She was raised by her mother, who was “a theoretical physicist turned actuary.” During the economic downturn of the 1990s, Baronova's mother was destitute. She told Rolling Stone that her family began growing its own vegetables at their grandparents' home and stored them for winter. Her mother died of breast cancer when Baronova was 18, and six months later Baronova, who at the time was studying chemistry at Moscow University, took a job selling laboratory equipment. Later she worked as a sales manager for a chemical distributor. Activism For two months during the Medvedev presidency, she worked as business manager, assistant, press secretary, and spokeswoman for Ilya Ponomarev, a member of the Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament. Ponomarev was a leading figure in the Just Russia party as well as in the opposition movement. When police later searched her apartment, Baronova said that she believed the searches were motivated by her association with Ponomarev, while he suggested that the purpose of the searches was to locate evidence against him. It was while she was working for Ponomarev that Baronova grew to oppose Medvedev and became an activist. “I think most of us who came out [and became opposition activists] were tired,” she said. She accused the leading party of operating a corrupt system using kickbacks and bribes that enriched a few at the expense of the country as a whole. The incident that triggered her turn to activism occurred during the parliamentary elections of December 2011. She witnessed and tried to report an electoral violation but, as she put it, was “thwarted.” The next day, she took part in a protest rally, which marked the start of her life as an activist. She began passing out leaflets, holding interviews with the press, and staging one-person protests that resulted in several detentions, according to Masha Gessen. “Thanks to her charisma, Baronova quickly became a celebrity of the anti-Putin movement,” noted the Daily Beast. Beginning in December 2011, she served as the opposition movement’s volunteer spokeswoman. For a time she was one of the most well-known protesters in Moscow. She was profiled in Russian GQ and appeared on a calendar of “12 Dissident Women.” =Bolotnaya Square protests= On the morning of May 6, 2012, Baronova was detained by police at the Zakonospassky monastery, where “she had asked a priest to say a prayer in support of her friends, the three jailed members of the Pussy Riot band.” Released within hours, she organized an instantaneous protest in Bolotnaya Square that devolved into “a police riot, mass detentions, and beatings.” Enraged at the brutality of police officers during the demonstration, she yelled at them: “You violated your oath just as badly as your tsar did!” Facing a line of soldiers, she recited to them Article 31 of the Russian Constitution, which guarantees freedom of assembly. After the protests, authorities threatened to charge Baronova with “organizing disorders,” but she was ultimately charged with the lesser offense of “inciting disorders.” Instead of imprisoning her like other defendants in the Bolotnaya Square case, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation released her on the understanding that she would not leave Moscow. State guardianship agents threatened to take away her son. In June 2012, after being formally charged with inciting a riot, she told Masha Gessen that she had been busy “reassuring people,” explaining that it was “like when a loved one dies: you have to let everyone know that things on the inside are not quite as horrible as they seem from the outside.” =Household raid= Five weeks after the Bolotnaya Square protests, while Baronova and her son were not at home, agents of the Investigative Committee, Russia's FBI, forced her son's babysitter to open the door and raided it, carrying assault rifles. They restrained her son's nanny to the floor and searched the flat, writing out a seizure order that Baronov later laughed at because, she said, it read “like a parody of Orwell or Kafka.” The order read in part: “In the righthand corner of a shoe box, located to the right of the entryway, 86 stickers were found and confiscated with the words, ‘In what kind of Russia shall we live? One of fairness, freedom and justice.'” The order also listed “two books, four laptops, a protest organizer’s badge, 31 copies of the opposition newspaper Grazhdanin (Citizen), and exactly 15 'strips of white material 36 cm in length.'” (The symbol of the protest movement is a white ribbon.) Searches were also conducted at other opposition leaders’ apartments. In addition, the agents confiscated family photos, protest buttons, “several booklets about Putin and a DVD of an anti-Putin movie,” as well as “a pin with a pink triangle, a symbol of gay rights activism.” They even took items of personal hygiene, a medical inhaler, and “ultrasound images from Baranova's pregnancy.” Apropos of the confiscation of the ultrasound images, Baronova said that she asked them: “do you think my child was planning unrest?” She later said that she found the entire seizure order funny, and that later, when she was interrogated, she found that procedure funny too, until she learned that she faced a charge of inciting a riot, the most serious charge yet leveled against any Bolotnaya Square protester. =Later developments= Baronova told Time magazine in June 2012 that “at a certain point, an activist is more useful to the cause from behind bars....So if it’s my time to go, I’ll go.” In the summer of 2012, she received anonymous phone calls telling her “You will die in three weeks” and “We know that you have moved to a new place, but you won't get away from us.” In August 2012, Baronova accused the police of provoking the violence at Bolotnaya Square, and said that Putin was out for vengeance. “We spoiled his holiday and now he is spoiling our lives,” she said. Prohibited from leaving Moscow, she was kept under watch by the authorities, who after their search of her flat repeatedly entered it again when she was out, moving furniture around and turning on her stove, which are reportedly “commonplace scare tactics.” She has said that she tried to deal with this harassment by pretending that nothing was going on. “That's the only way to get used to it,” she said. “Pretend that no one wrote notes on my door threatening to kill me and my son.” She also received anonymous text messages threatening to kill her and Sasha. Also, her grandfather accused her of working clandestinely for the U.S. State Department, “Russia’s worst enemy.” During the months after the Bolotnaya Square protests, Boronova was also interrogated at length several times by a special investigative unit. In addition, she was reportedly spied on by social-service workers who issued “a thinly veiled threat that her son might be taken away from her.” In late June, she received a visit from representatives of social services and was told that a complaint had been made about her parenting of Sasha. Searching her flat, the social-service workers “asked why she had English-language books, why there were cigarettes on the kitchen table, whether the violin aligned with sanitary norms.” Commenting later on these questions, Boronova later said: “That's when I realised I'm in a nuthouse.” Prohibited from leaving Moscow, she continued to be active in protest, feeling that her organizing skills “could help to bring down the power of crooks and thieves.” In July 2012, for example, she helped put together a donation drive after 170 people died in a flood in the town of Krymsk. In a November 2012 Facebook posting that attracted a good deal of attention, Baronova expressed her anguish over the injuries and prison sentences her fellow activists were receiving for their commitment. She stated that she saw “no more sense” in keeping on with the protests. The Daily Beast commented that Baronova, once “a young rising star of Russia’s anti-Putin activist movement,” was now unsure as to whether she wanted to continue pursuing activism. Controversially, moreover, she criticized some of her fellow opposition figures. “At one point,” she has said, “I suddenly got the impression that one-third of the opposition movement was made up of not particularly clever people, another one-third of Kremlin agents and the final third of simply crazy folks.” She has said that “half of the country...believes all that idiocy about how Russia is a strong, great power and America hates us and how we need to conquer and defeat everyone.” She has affirmed that “we need to go on protests, but we need to do something more, as well. Russians never carry things through until the end. It's a genetic and psychological peculiarity, I guess.” In December 2013, Baronova and several other opposition figures, including Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the members of Pussy Riot, were amnestied. While Khodorkovsky and the Pussy Riot members went on to travel around the world, however, and to speak about the situation in their homeland, Baronova could not leave Russia. She was unable to secure an EU visa because her name appeared on a Russian police database as a result of her case. “She fought for 'Western values,' Baronova says, and now the West is punishing her for it,” reported Reuters. In an interview after her amnesty, she expressed hostility toward some of her fellow activists and suggested sarcastically that perhaps “the best place to live” was the planet Mars. “On the other hand, maybe because of this insanity, things will be reformed in the next 20 years, who knows.” Baronova has said that it would be a “moral crime” to flee Russia. But she has also expressed the wish to study abroad for a Ph.D. Julia Ioffe of the New Republic reported on February 5, 2014, that Baronova was now working as a science correspondent for Dozhd (“Rain”), the last independent Russian TV channel. “It is the only work that she, a chemist and once a well-paid sales manager at a chemical-supplies company, could get after becoming a defendant in such a public, politicised trial,” explained Ioffe. Shortly thereafter, Baronova wrote an article, entitled “No One Has Done More for Ukrainian Nationalism than Vladimir Putin,” that appeared in The New Republic's issue of March 3, 2014. In the article, Baronova described the then-ongoing war in Crimea as “the strangest war I’ve seen in my 30 years,” and dubbed it Phoney War 2.0, a reference to the so-called “Phoney War” from September 3, 1939 to May 10, 1940. She added that while Putin was being compared widely to Hitler, he was in fact “closer to Stalin.” In 2016, she unsuccessfully ran as a candidate for Duma. She was not supported by a registered political party, but rather by the Open Russia organization. In February 2019, she joined Russian government television network RT to work on a charity project called \\"DDBM\\". Personal life Baronova has been called “fiery” and “idealistic.” Gessen has described her as “tall, blond, loud, and given to wearing short skirts and high heels.” References External link * Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Russian activists Category:Russian women activists Category:Russian politicians ","title":"Maria Baronova"},{"id":"42159743","text":"One Chance may refer to:  Music  * One Chance (group), an American band * One Chance (album), a 2007 Paul Potts album * \\"One Chance\\", a 2009 Meghan Trainor song from the album Meghan Trainor  Other uses  * One Chance (film), a 2013 film * One Chance (video game), a 2010 video game ","title":"One Chance"},{"id":"42159745","text":"Rooftops of Tehran may refer to one of the following books: * Rooftops of Tehran (poetry collection), a 2008 poetry collection by Sholeh Wolpe * Rooftops of Tehran (novel), a 2009 novel by Mahbod Seraji ","title":"Rooftops of Tehran"},{"id":"42159764","text":"Shewanella decolorationis is a gram-negative, dye-decolorizing bacterium first isolated from activated sludge of a waste-water treatment plant.

After two moves it found in 1926 a permanent home in Haslemere High Street, in the town of Haslemere, Surrey, England. The museum won a national award in 2012 and is an independent charity. It contains nearly half a million specimens, artefacts, papers and images. History Already a successful surgeon with homes in London and Haslemere, Sir Jonathan Hutchinson was also keenly interested in the full spectrum of science and nature. At the farm that was his home in Haslemere he had already amassed a large collection of specimens and fossils collected on his travels, and in 1888 he opened a museum in the outbuildings, encouraging a then-revolutionary 'hands-on' approach. By 1895 the expanding collection needed larger premises, and was moved to what is now Museum Hill. Hutchinson himself lectured at the museum and before he died in 1913 he left money for repairs and enlargement. The museum moved to its present location in Haslemere High Street in 1926. A Museum Examination for children was established in 1899 and a primary function of the museum was always to be education. The curator of the museum for more than 50 years from 1897 to 1948 was Ernest William Swanton. Swanton was a mycologist, and author of Fungi and How to Know Them (1909); he helped and encouraged many would-be mycologists. John Clegg was curator from 1949 to 1962. He was a writer and photographer with a keen interest in pond life, and wrote the book on this topic for the Observer series of pocket guides. He also wrote The Freshwater Life of the British Isles. Clegg was succeeded by his assistant curator Arthur Jewell. Jewell had joined the museum from school in 1974 and retired in 2008, and the museum's Education Room is named in his honour. Arthur, a stuffed Siberian bear and a museum mascot, is also named after him. Among the many active members of the museum during the 20th century was naturalist Margaret Hutchinson, Sir Jonathan's granddaughter, who was some-time honorary librarian, committee member and trustee. Another volunteer, Penny Hollow, who celebrated 40 years at the museum in 2009 having started after leaving school, in a postscript to the centenary edition of Margaret Hutchinson's memoirs remembered: :\\"A tall and imposing figure, she was greatly respected and everyone at the Museum was slightly in awe of her, always ensuring that her requests (polite notes signed with the characteristic \\"MMH\\") were quickly acted upon.\\" At the time of her 40-years celebration, Hollow noted of the museum: :\\"There is a wonderful camaraderie and independence, a unique combination with everyone, staff and volunteers, working together.\\" In 2011, the museum suffered the theft of a horned rhino skull with a black market value estimated to be £60,000. The perpetrators were apprehended following an appeal on the BBC's Crimewatch programme and two men were jailed in 2013. There was a spate of similar thefts of rhino horn from museums. In 2012, the museum won the Sunday Telegraph Family Friendly Museums Award from over 600 nominations. The museum celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2013, attended by Sophie, Countess of Wessex. Collections The three main galleries cover geology, natural history and human history, and contain some 240,000 specimens and 140,000 artefacts from around the world. There are also textile and fine art exhibits. The reference library covers the whole spectrum of science and history with about 7,000 books, 13,500 scientific and historical periodicals and over 22,000 documents, largely but not exclusively relating to the local area. There are also more than 2,000 maps and about 35,000 photographic images dating from the museum's foundation to the present day. Other features As well as the collections and interactive exhibits within the museum building there are extensive grounds, including a herb garden, pond, meadow and woodland featuring a large variety of wild plants which in turn attract wildlife. There is an observation beehive. The museum has facilities for exhibitions and runs regular workshops, courses and lectures for people of all ages, as well as providing outreach visits to schools and community groups. With the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund, the museum is establishing online databases and enabled the employment of a full-time professional education specialist. The museum and Haslemere Natural History Society are closely associated; the museum's library includes some of HNHS's reference works, and HNHS holds talks at the museum during the winter. Among the patrons of the museum (2014) are Sir Vernon Ellis, Chairman of the British Council, Professor of Paleontology Richard Fortey, and lifelong supporter of museums Loyd Grossman. There is a considerable corporate patronage. Professor David Bellamy in his book A Natural Life declared the museum to be his favourite when a child. The museum hosts the Haslemere Visitor and Local Information Centre.

History John W. Pittock, a 21-year-old former newsboy, first published the Leader as a Sunday weekly on 11 December 1864. A daily edition called the Evening Leader appeared on 18 October 1870 under the leadership of Pittock and partners John I. Nevin, Robert P. Nevin, and Edward H. Nevin. The paper took a nonpartisan stance in political matters. Already in 1873, the Leader was listed in Rowell's American Newspaper Directory as having the largest daily circulation in Pittsburgh. It was also at the time the city's only daily with a Sunday edition, aside from the German-language Volksblatt. Following Pittock's death in 1881, members of the Nevin family conducted the paper for many years, finally selling it in 1906 to a team led by Alexander Pollock Moore, who became publisher and editor-in-chief. It was often said that ex-political boss William Flinn took part in the purchase and so jeopardized the paper's journalistic independence. Muckraker Will Irwin, writing in Collier's magazine, accused Moore of turning the responsible, civic-minded Leader into a scandalmongering \\"yellow newspaper.\\" Pittsburgh newspaper consolidation timeline The Leader and the Pittsburgh Dispatch published their last issues on 14 February 1923, being jointly purchased and absorbed by the other Pittsburgh papers: the Post, Sun, Gazette Times, Chronicle Telegraph, and the Press. At the time, advertisers and publishers had long regarded the Pittsburgh newspaper market as overcrowded. Only four years after the demise of the Leader and Dispatch, mergers further narrowed the field of mainstream Pittsburgh dailies from five to three. Notable contributors Early in her career, author Willa Cather worked at the Leader as a telegraph editor and drama critic. Investigative journalist and media critic George Seldes started out as a cub reporter at the Leader in 1909 at age 18. In a late-life memoir, he alleged that the Leader and other papers had allowed businesses to kill unfavorable stories in exchange for advertising payments. Actress Lillian Russell, who was married to publisher Moore, had a beauty advice column called \\"Lillian Russell's Philosophy.\\" Russell's death in June 1922 possibly contributed to Moore's decision to discontinue the paper; Moore said in his farewell column eight months later that \\"since June of last year I have not had the same incentive to continuous effort that previously inspired me.\\" Arthur G. Burgoyne or cartoonist Fred Johnston, or both, created the character Father Pitt as a personification of the city of Pittsburgh. The character was adopted by numerous editorial cartoonists in other Pittsburgh papers.

The University of Wisconsin Law School offers two major programs and one doctorate program to the almost 800 students that make up the student body.  History  The College of Law was started in 1868, but the first building wasn't built until 1893. The first building was a maroon Castle like structure. It was torn down in the spring of 1963 to make way for an addition to the old building. The second building was built in 1938; it is a square brick building on the south side of Bascom Hill. It was originally built to relieve congestion from the first building. Since the first building had been constructed, the way law was being taught had changed significantly. Law was now being taught more in small classrooms instead of large lecture rooms. It's a six-story building and cost $1.5 million to build. The building is 94,000 square feet, and holds 100,000 volumes of textbooks. The building was then also built specially to not burn down so that the many textbooks, documents, and other papers stay safe and are not lost. A main attraction for this part of the building is the mural painted in the old reading room in the library. The mural is called The Freeing of the Slaves and is 12 by 35 feet, with the central figure standing 11 feet tall. The newest addition to the law building was finished in 1996. It is 138,000 square feet and cost $16.1 million to build. It was 15 years in design and management and took two years to construct. It added faculty offices, large classrooms, lecture rooms, and two mock trial rooms. Also the addition added 200,000 new spaces for textbooks in the library. It is combined to the old building to allow easy movement between buildings. The engineers called it \\"The Hanger\\" because of its appearance; giant glass windows surround the library to allow the natural light to enter.

The trail is usually described as extending from Cahokia in the south, to Peoria in the north. During the 1810s and 1820s the trace played a decisive role in the settlement of Central Illinois by Euro- Americans. History =Active trail= The Native Americans had, by 1492, developed a complex skein of roads, trails, and traces over most of North America. While most of these trails are lost to written history, the trail from Cahokia to Peoria remained in active use during the late 1600s and early 1700s, the time of intensive activity by French-speaking missionaries. Bearers of the Catholic faith won some converts among the Natives of the Illinois Confederation, and Cahokia and Peoria were the sites of two large semi-urban agricultural settlements of the clans of this group. French records mention the trace from 1711 onward. With the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, the United States of America acquired nominal sovereignty over the land that would become Central Illinois. The young country was unable to exercise effective control over the frontier territory until the War of 1812, when many Native American tribes of the Illinois Territory, hoping to maintain their culture and way of life, allied themselves with the fur traders of British Upper Canada. The frontiersmen of the so-called American Bottom, grouped around Cahokia, saw this alliance as a threat and determined upon action. A local leader, territorial governor Ninian Edwards, recruited 350 frontiersmen into a troop of Illinois Rangers. Striking northward from the American Bottom on the Trace, the rangers penetrated into what was then territory occupied by the Kickapoo people, winning military control over the Sangamon River and the region around Peoria. Ninian became a hero to his fellow frontiersmen and, when Illinois achieved statehood in 1818, the ranger leader was promptly elected to the U.S. Senate. In 1826, Edwards was elected Governor of Illinois. Following the War of 1812, Central Illinois was open to agricultural settlement and the Edwards Trace entered upon its busiest period of active use. The Trace and the prairie lands around it were carefully surveyed. In the 1820s and (to a somewhat lesser extent) in the 1830s, the trace was a primary pathway for Euro-Americans in and out of the Sangamon River Valley. Cartloads of furs, buffalo hides, and deerhides rolled southward, to be replaced by salt, gunpowder, lead ingots, iron tools, short and long guns, agricultural implements, textiles, and the other supplies required for frontier life. The freight traffic dug ruts in the Central Illinois prairie sod. As shallow-draft steamboats began to steam up and down the Illinois River, which runs parallel to the Trace, use of the Trace began to decline. =Legacy= The Edwards Trace remained in active use into the 1840s. The Alton & Sangamon railroad was chartered in 1847 to improve transportation in and out of the belt served by the Trace, and as the new trackage was built, the old trail fell into inactivity. Parts of it appear to have continued in use as rural dirt roads for many years, but eventually the Trace almost completely disappeared. In the 1900s, few wanted to remember the old trail. In the War of 1812, the event from which the Trace had gotten its English name, the northward thrust of Edwards's troop of Illinois rangers had been conducted with a brutality that was taken for granted by the successful frontiersmen at the time. Edwards and his men had conducted a search-and-destroy operation, destroying and burning every Native property they could find – including homes and villages led by Kickapoo who had tried to live in peace with the United States. Furthermore, almost all of the Trace had physically disappeared. Its sodded ruts had been paved over with asphalt, plowed up as loamy farmland, or buried under later engineering projects. The original surveyors' records of the Trace survived and, supplemented by the published reminiscences of old settlers, enabled local historians to locate one remaining short section of Trace ruts in what is now Lake Park, parallel to the shore of Lake Springfield. A historical marker to celebrate the rediscovery was erected in 2002. The Edwards Trace knit together what are now the communities of Cahokia, Edwardsville, Springfield, Elkhart, and Peoria, all within Central Illinois. Sections of Interstate 55 and Interstate 155 parallel the Trace's line today. See also * Buffalo Trace, a southern Indiana trace with a parallel history.

The Xbox One version was launched on September 1, 2016 worldwide. The PC/Mac version, initially planned for release at the same time as the Xbox One release, was postponed to September 27, 2016. The game is planned to be the first volume of an Earthlock trilogy. A version for the Nintendo Switch was released on March 8, 2018. A sequel, titled Earthlock 2, is scheduled for a 2022 release. Gameplay Screenshot from combatThe game plays as a non- linear role-playing video game with turn based battles. In combat, characters fight in pairs - a \\"warrior\\" and a \\"protector\\". The warrior uses consumable items such as ammunition, while the protector can perform spells like healing and shields. When the characters are damaged by enemies, they accumulate support points, which can be used to activate other moves. Pairing different combinations of characters unlocks different moves and tactics, greatly affecting the flow of battle. Story The game's story takes place in the world of Umbra, where a cataclysmic event occurs that stops the planet from spinning. This leaves part of the world scorched by constant sunlight, part of it perpetually cold due to lack of sunlight, and a patch of livable land in between. The incident ends up burying much of the past advanced civilization, but humanity survives and society begins anew in the habitable part of the planet. The story follows the adventurer Amon, who, among his usual activities of scavenging ruins, gets entangled in a much larger conflict with the ruling Suvian Empire. Development The game is inspired by early Square Japanese role-playing games, though Snowcastle wanted to subvert common genre character stereotypes. Development for the game started as early as 2011, with a pre- alpha build trailer being released in May 2013. The game was originally just known by its subtitle, Festival of Magic. In November 2013, the game was placed on crowdfunding platform Kickstarter with the aim of securing $250,000 in funding. However, Snowcastle later pulled from the platform, due to it getting lost in the crowd during the holiday season. A fresh Kickstarter campaign was launched in March 2014 with a lowered goal of $150,000. This second campaign was successful, raising $178,000 in April 2014. The game's plot will be written by comic book writer Magnus Aspli. An early concept demo was released in March 2014 for the Windows, OS X and Linux platforms. Snowcastle Games partnered with Cross Function to release the game in Japan. Despite waning interest in the Wii U in 2016 after the announcement of the Nintendo Switch, Snowcastle Games upheld their promise of a Wii U version, with an unnamed third-party handling porting duties. The Wii U version was ultimately released in September 2017 as a digital-only title.

Biography  Jack Hiram Little was born on 20 December 1908 in Missoula, Montana the second child of John Herman Little (a salesman and amateur vaudeville performer) and Edna Jane née Fife (a teacher). In 1931 Little worked for KJR, an all-sports radio station based in Seattle, Washington, where, in February 1932, he commentated his first professional wrestling show from Everett. During World War II he served in the United States Army, following which he moved to Hollywood, where he worked for KPOL sports radio station, announcing televised wrestling matches from the Hollywood Legion Stadium. In 1952 Little moved to Australia, with his second wife, Patricia McNamara, and their family, working as a radio compere for Melbourne station, 3DB, where he hosted his own shows, including The Greys Game, Two For the Money and Magazine of the Air. In 1956 Little together with a number of other 3DB personnel moved to TV station, GTV-9, where he worked alongside Eric Pearce presenting the news. He also performed and scripted sketches on In Melbourne Tonight (1957), hosted Personal Album (November 1958 – May 1959) and Taking It Easy (1960) as well as regular appearances on It Could Be You, (1961–69) alongside Tommy Hanlon, Jr. Little also performed in a number of stage productions, including Tea and Sympathy (1956), the musical The Pajama Game (1957) and \\"Anniversary Waltz\\" (1958). When GTV-9 purchased radio station 3AK in 1961, it required its personalities to also present radio programs. Little appeared with Tommy Hanlon, Jr. on a 3AK Saturday morning program. In 1957 Little brought film footage of US professional wrestling to Australia, where it was screened on HSV-7 as International Wrestling later becoming Ringside with the Rasslers. In 1960 GTV-9 began telecasts of wrestling from Melbourne Festival Hall, with Little providing the commentary. In 1964 Little convinced US wrestling promoters, Jim Barnett and Johnny Doyle that it was viable to bring professional wrestling to Australia. Little had previously worked with Doyle in the US. On 23 October 1964 Barnett and Doyle presented the first match of the World Championship Wrestling at the Sydney Stadium. A headline making event was when a television match for the Australian championship between Killer Karl Kox and Spiros Arion was declared ended due to time limit by Little. Kox responded by applying a wrestling manoeuvre, 'Brain Buster', to Little, who was hospitalised and called matches over the following month while wearing a neck brace. Little's memorable catchphrases included \\"Wham! Bam! Thank you Mam!\\", \\"All I can say is – Wow!\\", \\"Be There!\\" and \\"That's all there is, there isn't any more!\\". In 1978 Little retired from broadcasting although he continued to be associated with the sport into the 1980s. During 1985 Andrew Duffield and Phil Kenihan produced a three-track extended play, Over the Ropes – A Tribute to Jack Little by The Forearm Jolt, which used a compilation of commentaries by Little and his co- host, Paul Jennings, from their program, World Championship Wrestling. The extended play was released as a tribute to the ailing Little. The Forearm Jolt were a studio ensemble with Duffield on keyboards; Mark Ferrie on bass guitar; James Valentine on saxophone; twins sisters Sherine and Zan Abeyratne on vocals; Rozzi Bazzani on vocals; John Fielding on trumpet; Noel Crombie on thumps and bumps; and Andrew Pendlebury on lead guitar. Lyrics were co-written by Duffield, Kenihan and news journalist, James Cockington.  Personal life  In 1935 he married Ann Oman in Portland, Oregon, they had a daughter and were later divorced. On 17 September 1942 he married Patricia McNamara in Los Angeles (a divorced Australian office worker) and they moved to Australia in 1952. The couple had two daughters. In 1959 Little and Patricia divorced. On 12 December 1967 he married Patricia Dolores Anderson (known as Patti Raye), a singer-dancer. In 1946 he acknowledged his alcoholism, joined Alcoholics Anonymous and maintained his sobriety as well as supporting others. Little died from a heart complaint at the William Angliss Hospital in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, on 4 January 1986. He was survived by his third wife, the daughter of his first marriage and the two daughters of his second.

Lahaina became the seat of government for the Hawaiian Kingdom until 1845. The king commissioned the structure to be built at Keawa'iki point in Lahaina, Maui. Two foreign, ex-convicts from Australia's Botany Bay penal colony built the home. It was begun in 1798 and was completed after 4 years in 1802. The house was intended for Kamehameha's favorite and most powerful wife, Kaahumanu, but she refused to live in the structure and resided instead in a traditional Hawaiian-styled home only feet away. Kamehameha used the building as part of his encampment in 1802, with over 1000 people in his entourage. The encampment area surrounding the building became a neighborhood known for the chiefly line associated with Kamehameha. Food was grown for the royal family and the area called the \\"Royal Taro Patch\\" was connected with this structure. After the unsuccessful war on Kauai, Kamehameha moved his court to Honolulu. Construction The Brick Palace of Kamehameha I was built using the \\"British bond\\" method of brick laying with a lavender-colored mortar The site was selected because of the king's strong ties to the island of Maui. Two of his wives were from districts on the island, Kaʻahumanu and Keōpūolani. Kamehameha I was highly interested in western-style buildings. Prior to 1795 there were several shipwrecked foreigners on Oahu. From these foreigners, Kamehameha commissioned Mr. Mela (Miller) and Mr. Keka 'ele'ele (Black Jack), two escaped convicts from the penal colony of Australia, known as Botany Bay. Keka 'ele'ele was possibly the first black settler in the Hawaiian Islands. The two had been on the island since before the unification. After the Battle of Nuʻuanu they took Kamehameha's side. The building was built on top of a mound enclosed with a dry masonry wall built of round rocks between one and two feet on diameter. The mound was larger than the structure and likely had a canoe landing; it was paved with black water-smoothed pebbles and probably formed part of a more ancient structure. The foundations are dry masonry stone resting on a level sand lens. The house was a two-story building made of some sort of red brick. The bricks were laid in a pattern known as \\"British bond\\", likely because the two people enlisted to build the structure originated from England. It had glazed windows and possibly a chimney. The construction is estimated to have required 92 tons of clay to make 38,500 bricks. Despite earlier accounts of the measurements, excavations uncovered the dimensions to be 41 feet long and 15 feet wide. It was divided into four rooms using Koa wood for the interior. Within 17 years the wall of the structure began to sag and needed attention. The main issue was the traditional mound the structure was built on, which was designed for a typical Hawaiian hut. The weight of the building was too much. To attempt a fix, the entire building was plastered with mortar. Archaeology The remaining foundations of Kamehameha's Brick Palace were excavated in 1964 and can be seen in Lahaina, Maui. In 1964 Kenneth P. Emory of the Bishop Museum invited two archaeologists to excavate the site. The excavations were to answer the question of the exact location, materials used and the precise dimensions. After pavement was removed from the site location, excavations began on December 9, 1964. Walter M. Fredericksen and Demaris L. Fredericksen published their report of the excavations in 1965. The report was prepared for the Maui Historical Commission. =Brick= The bricks used to build the house varied in quality and most were red in color. Samples found indicate that most were fired from a brownish local clay. The variation in each brick could be from experimentation or from badly collected material. While clearly fired, it is also clear the bricks were not well fired. Their size varied between 1 1/2 and 3 inches in thickness. All the bricks found were of a period before standard modern bricks were available. The mortar was made up mostly of sand and coral. Two types were found: a lavender-colored mortar made of sand and coral (reduced by burning for its lime) was found through most of the remains with the exception of the east corner, where there was a brown mortar which was a softer mixture of mud sand and coral pieces. There were four courses of brick at the highest point of the remaining walls that were uncovered during excavations, all laid with their axes at right angles in the \\"British bond\\" brick-laying pattern. Three corners of the structure were found, designating the structure's total dimensions. Reconstruction Today the site of the Brick Palace is located at Lahaina Banyan Court Park off Front Street in Lahaina, directly behind the public library. Part of Wharf Street was removed in 1964 when the original excavations took place and now curves into Papelekane Street. A reconstructed outline of the palace structure is permanently displayed, set into a concrete base. A course of red is laid in the same manner as the original structure and clearly outlines the foundations and diameter of the structure.

He painted many scenes from life in and around Sunderland in the north of England. His paintings of local landmarks such as local castles and dockland scenes are now highly prized and several have been secured for local public galleries. The opening of Tyne Dock (Mark Thompson, 1850) Mark Thompson was born on Wearside in 1812. He was a keen amateur painter as a young man, while working in Sunderland as a general agent. He is believed to have taken instruction from several of the resident artists there. He did not become a professional artist until his late forties, becoming well known as painter of local scenes. Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens was the first local authority museum outside London to be established following the Museums Act of 1846. Its first recorded fine art acquisition was a commission by the Sunderland to Mark Thompson, who was paid 30 guineas to record the opening of the new South Dock in 1850. This may be the first occasion in which a town council anywhere in the United Kingdom commissioned a painting.More about Sunderland Museum & Winter Gardens. British Broadcasting Corporation / https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/galleries/collections/sunderland- museum-winter-gardens-1333/foreword Hylton Castle Sunderland Thompson moved to nearby Bishopswearmouth where he lived until his death in 1875. Most of Thompson's work arose from commissions from the local landed gentry for whom he executed many fine landscapes and topographical views, often recording the fine period country houses of the area for their owners.

Design  The predecessor to the Model 878, the Model 58, was a new semi-automatic design for Remington, being a gas operated system rather than the long recoil operation system designed by John Browning and used in the famous Browning Auto-5 and Remington Model 11 and Model 11-48. The Model 878 introduced an improved \\"self-adjusting\\" gas system compared to the Model 58. The Model 58 and Model 878 are virtually the same, with only differences in the gas piston and cosmetics. Both of these shotguns were essentially gas operated versions of the pump action Model 870. The Winchester Model 1400 also used this gas system, however the gas piston took space from the tube magazine. When Remington's Model 1100 came out with an updated gas system allowing for a higher-capacity magazine, these shotguns became obsolete.

An interspecies friendship is a non-sexual bond that is formed between animals of different species. Numerous cases of interspecies friendships among wild and domesticated animals have been reported and documented with photography and video. Domestication of animals has led to interspecies friendships between species that would never naturally exist together. In many cases of interspecies friendship, the pair of animals include those not known to get along, and sometimes, one is of a species that ordinarily preys upon the other in nature. The concept of interspecies friendship is similar to that of mutualism in that two individuals from different species exist in a relationship where each organism benefits from the activity of the other. This method can be seen in chicken friending strategies. Reasons for the formation of interspecies friendships include domestication, interspecies communication, mutually beneficial exchanges, desire for social bonding, protection, or is often unknown.  Friendships between humans and other animals  = Canis lupus familiaris = A dog with its human companion. The relationship between a human and a household dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is quite common and said to be similar to the relationship seen between a parent and child.Serpell, J.A., 2004. Factors influencing human attitudes to animals and theirwelfare. Anim. Welfare 13, 145–151. Many people agree that there is an emotional bond between themselves and their dog. An important indicator of the bond between a dog and its caregiver can be seen through separation and reunion incidences. The behaviour of the dog including approach latency and the frequency of initiating physical contact varies according to how familiar the dog is with the person. This can be viewed as a snapshot of their relationship. Behaviours such as tail wagging, lip licking, body shaking and vocalization also indicate this. = Felis catus = A human petting a cat. Friendships between household cats (Felis catus) and humans is also very common and in many countries, cats are the most popular choice of pet. Cat owners often consider their cat as an integrated part of their family and indicate that they are easy to care for and engage in social behaviours such as allowing humans to hold, pet and play with them. Mutual affection and bonding is displayed between cats and their owners, indicating a sense of friendship. = E. ferus = A human touching a horse's muzzle. Friendships between humans and domesticated horses (E. ferus) are often observed and occur when the horse is willing to allow the person into their flight distance and personal space through friendly interactions such as grooming, scratching and rubbing. Horses are social animals and once a person is accepted into their personal space, they become a part of their social system. A domesticated horse will work hard for praise from their human partner and can be easily trained to respond to human commands. Many people report strong feelings of friendship with their horse and believe that their horse considers them to be their friend, protector, and caretaker. = Non- domesticated animals = Interspecies friendships have been displayed between humans and non-domesticated animals. Some examples include: * The interspecies friendship between zoologist Dian Fossey and a group of gorillas. Fossey developed relationships with the gorillas she studied and after years of being away from them, they recognized and remembered her when she returned. After their reunion, the gorillas engaged in amicable behaviour with Fossey such as direct eye contact, sniffing, crooning, resting beside each other and embracing one another. * The relationship between Barbara Smuts and a baboon troop. Over the course of many interactions between Smuts and the baboons, eventually the baboons treated her as if she was a part of their troop. Smuts would comfortably rest with them, exchange friendly glances and felt safe amongst them. * Friendly encounters have been observed between gray whales and humans. Gray whales seem to enjoy when humans pat them alongside boats. During these human-whale interactions, the whales are generally timid and gentle.  Friendships between non-human animals  A cat and dog bonding = Dogs and cats = Dogs (Canis lupus familaris) and cats (Felis catus) that coexist in close quarters are two unrelated species that often display companionship towards each other. Many coexisting dogs and cats exhibit friendly relationships involving behaviours such as playing and sleeping together, grooming each other and understanding differences in body language and communication. Dogs and cats often engage in mutual nose sniffing which is a form of greeting displayed in cats that is not normally observed in dogs. Dogs may acquire this behaviour from the understanding of cat communication signals. = Other examples = A Tufted gray langur (Semnopithecus priam) stroking a Grizzled giant squirrel (Ratufa macroura) caringly at Yala National Park - Sri Lanka. There are many documented instances of unusual interspecies friendships. Some examples include: * Three large shore birds including a Long-billed curlew, Whimbrel and Marbled godwit kept each other company every winter in Vancouver for many years. * Near Cincinnati, three Northern cardinal and four Robin nestlings shared a nest and the parents of the nestlings worked together to bring food to their offspring. * A horse and wild turkey displayed friendly behaviour in which the horse would bow down his head and allow the turkey to climb on his back. * A ram and a blind cow exhibited interspecies friendship in which the ram would protect the cow by making sure she did not bump into anything and feeding beside her every day. When the cow gave birth to a calf, the ram exhibited these protective behaviours on the calf as well. * A steer and a blind mule formed an interspecies friendship in the Black Forest Animal Sanctuary. When the species were introduced, the steer automatically assumed a protective role over the blind mule by staying near her, sleeping next to her, playing with her and leading her around the pasture to protect her from injuries. * Coyotes are often known to hunt badgers, however, mutualistic relationships can develop between these rival species. Coyotes and badgers engage in ground squirrel hunting together in which the badgers dig into ground squirrel nests and hunt any they come across. Ground squirrels that manage to flee the site are captured by coyotes nearby. This hunting behaviour benefits both the coyotes and badgers because it allows each species to obtain food. The coyotes initiate ground squirrel hunting through friendly behaviours such as play-bowing, tail-wagging and scampering. The badgers respond to this behaviour even though they are not known to initiate these behaviours with other badgers. After the hunt, the animals often rest together with their bodies in close proximity or touching. * A timber wolf and two goats were kept in enclosures next to each other in the San Diego Zoo and engaged in a playful relationship which involved racing each other back and forth by the fence separating them. They would also rest next to each other by the fence and the wolf would try to lick the goats' faces. They would be let outside the same time each day so that they could play together and the wolf would only go inside at night if the goats were already inside. *A miniature horse and farm goose were rescued together and formed an interspecies friendship in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. The horse was recovering from infection, which made the farm goose more protective of him. The goose would show protective behavior when staff would treat the horse.  Why interspecies friendships form  = Domestication = Domestication is defined as a multi- generational relationship in which one group of organisms assumes a significant degree of influence over the reproduction and care of another group to secure a more predictable supply of resources from that second group. In the previous 11,000 years, humans have brought a wide range of species into domestication to use as livestock, working animals, household pets, and companions.Zeder, M. (2012). Pathways to animal domestication. Biodiversity In Agriculture: Domestication, Evolution Andsustainability, 227-59. The influence of human behaviour on domesticated animals has led to many species having learned to co-exist - sometimes leading to the formation of an interspecies friendship. For example, interspecies friendships are often observed in humans with their domesticated pets and in pets that live in the same household such as cats and dogs. = Interspecies communication = Interspecies communication can form the basis of an interspecies friendship because it facilitates mutualism and bonds between animals. Species can communicate to each other both verbally and non-verbally as seen in human-dog communication. The communication exhibited between dogs and humans allow friendships to form which is often displayed through social bonding activities such as play. Interspecific communication is an effective way of forming mutuality and interspecies friendships in the wild which often involves different species warning each other about potential danger approaching. Species of monkeys have been observed to communicate with each other through their alarm calls leading to mutuality between the counterparts. In particular, West African Diana monkeys and Campbell's monkeys seem to understand and react to the alarm calls of the other species and form associations with each other through mutual protection. = Mutualism = Mutualism can contribute to the formation of interspecies friendships because it involves a pair of organisms experiencing mutually beneficial exchanges with each other which may lead to a long-lasting bond. The mutualistic relationship observed between coyotes and badgers after hunting ground squirrels together is an example of mutualism developing into an unlikely interspecies friendship. Interspecies friendships often form between humans and domesticated animals through mutualism in which the human gains something beneficial from their pet and the pet gains something beneficial from the human. This is often observed in human-canine friendships in which dogs benefit by being cared for and offered love and companionship from humans while humans benefit by receiving companionship, loyalty and love from their dogs. = Protection = Protective behaviour exhibited from one species onto another can lead to an interspecies friendship as it allows the formation of a bond to occur between species. This is often observed in interspecies adoptions in which one species \\"adopts\\" another that is orphaned or hurt. For example, an infant marmoset was adopted by capuchin monkeys and the marmoset became socially included and protected in their group. Other examples include a ram protecting a blind cow and a steer protecting a blind mule. In each circumstance, interspecies friendships are formed after the protectors assumed protective roles. = Social Bonding = Many species seek out social bonding with other species which often involves play behaviours. Play can act as a form of communication between companions in which the participants mutually understand that the interaction is playful and pleasurable. Play is specifically fundamental to interactions between humans and their non-human companions such as play exhibited in human-canine bonding. Human-canine play requires that both the human and dog communicate to understand the situation and goal of the game through their actions. Social bonding is observed in many interspecies interactions such as those between humans and their household pets, humans and primates, and many other animals in the wild. Since social bonding involves communication and interactions between different species, it can lead to the development of interspecies friendships.  Trait selection and convergent evolution  Animals often portray many similar characteristics displayed by humans. There looms large belief that while both humans and animals evolve simultaneously, domesticated animals have benefitted the most from human-animal relationships because they have increased in population much further than they ever would have in a natural occurrence because of their selected \\"human-like\\" characteristics. The selection of behavioural skills provides a typical environment for :convergent evolution. = Canis lupus familiaris = A reunion between a dog and a human. There is a wide range of shared general and specific social skills between humans and dogs including functional and behavioural traits. Sociality, the ability to perform synchronized behaviour and complex constructive skills have each been previously displayed in both dogs and humans. For example, qualities of sociality include lifelong attachment, reduced intra-group aggression, enhanced cooperation. Whereas, synchronized behaviours include imitation, hypnosis and dance and complex constructive skills include mimesis and language. Dogs display specific social skills during interaction with humans for their benefit. Advancement in attachment skills for the dogs enables them further benefit from humans by gaining valuable information, protection and help. Animals that have evolved social skills gained close integration with humans and their community resulting in more successful species. Human-dog relationships are the most common interspecies friendships, resulting in dogs becoming one of the most successful mammalian species to exist.

Following seven months of pre-trial detention in Evin Prison, including more than two months in solitary confinement, Shafipour was sentenced in March 2014 to seven years in prison for her political activities. Human rights organization have called for her release and condemned her conviction and prison sentence. She was released in July 2015. Biography Shafipour studied water engineering at Imam Khomeini International University in Qazvin. She was a member of the women's committee of Mehdi Karroubi's campaign for president in the June 2009 elections in Iran. The ensuing protests led government authorities to crack down on politically active students that supported reformist candidates Mir- Hossein Mousavi and Karroubi, including banning individuals like Shafipour from pursuing higher education. She was suspended and later expelled from her university in 2010 for political activities including “blogging”, “reporting for local newspapers” and “involving in student movements“ In 2010, Shafipour also received a one-year suspended prison sentence for \\"spreading propaganda against the system\\". A suspended sentence is not implemented unless the person is found guilty of another charge. Her activism also included \\"advocating for the rights of university students barred from higher education because of their activism and for the release of political prisoners\\", including Karroubi, and she was a member of “council of define rights of education”, a group established by students who banned to continue their education. As soon as she was released from prison, she took preliminary steps to launch the campaign of “In Support of Imprisoned Mothers” in coordination with Shirin Ebadi (the Nobel peace prize winner). The campaign started its activities in a gathering in front of the International Court of Justice in The Hague in support of prisoner mothers. Shafipour was invited by “Noble Women’s Initiative” to take part in a mentorship program as a young woman human rights defender in Canada in August 2016. Since then, she has lived in Canada. In 2016, she launched the #FreeNarges social media campaign following the unfair verdict of the Iranian judiciary sentencing Narges Mohammadi to 16 years in prison. A number of independent civil rights and human rights activists decided to launch this campaign as part of a concerted effort to support Narges and her goal of eliminating discrimination against Iranian women, and to draw attention to her plight. Arrest and detention Appearing before the Evin Prison Court on 27 July 2013 after being summoned, Shafipour was arrested. Transferred to Evin Prison in Tehran, she spent 67 days in solitary confinement during which she was denied access to a lawyer. She was then moved to the prison's general ward, where she spent another five months in pre-trial detention while her case judge refused to release her on bail. During this time, interrogators reportedly \\"subjected her to psychological and physical abuse, including kicking her.\\" On 16 September 2013, Shafipour was transferred to a hospital outside the prison for a brief period, though the prison authorities refused to tell her parents why she was sent to the hospital. She had complained to her family earlier about numbness in one of her hands. In December 2013, she reportedly fainted due to the onset of an irregular heartbeat and was taken to the prison medical clinic. Trial and sentencing Shafipour's first court hearing was held on 21 October 2013 in Branch 15 of the Revolutionary Court in Tehran. The charges against her included \\"spreading propaganda against the system.\\" A second court hearing scheduled for 1 January 2014 was postponed due to the absence of the presiding judge. On 1 March 2014, Branch 28 of Tehran Revolutionary Court informed Shafipour's lawyer that she had been convicted \\"on charges of 'propaganda against the regime' and 'assembly and collusion against national security,' and sentenced to seven years in prison and two years' ban on 'cyberspace, media, and press activities.'\\" In July 2015, she was released from Evin prison.22 July 2015 Human Rights Activists News Agency: Maryam Shafipour Released from Evin Prison Reaction Human rights organizations Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran have called for the release of Shafipour and condemned her conviction and prison sentence. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa Programme at Amnesty International, stated, \\"Maryam Shafi' Pour's conviction is a chilling reminder of how little Iran's human rights record has changed since 2009, when students were arrested in droves during post-election unrest.\\" References Category:Living people Category:Iranian women activists Category:Iranian human rights activists Category:2014 in Iran Category:2015 in Iran Category:Iranian dissidents Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Maryam Shafipour"},{"id":"42160801","title":"The Coming Storm (album)"},{"id":"42160816","text":"Spressa delle Giudicarie is an Italian cheese that comes from the region of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.Spressa delle Giudicarie cheese, Italian Cow cheese made in Trentino Alto Adige The Spressa delle Giudicarie can be consumed fresh after three months, while curing takes more than six months.

Biography Van Anrooy was born in Zaltbommel to Peter Gijsbert van Anrooij, an apothecary, and Jozefa Helena Maria Pool. The family soon moved to Utrecht, where van Anrooy learned piano, violin and composition in a music school (1890–1899). Then for two years he studied conducting in Dresden and Moscow; in Moscow he also received lessons in counterpoint from Sergei Taneyev. After completing his studies, van Anrooy played violin with orchestras in Glasgow and Zurich and by 1905 returned to the Netherlands, where around 1905 he assumed positions of conductor with the Groningen Orchestra and director of a music school. In Groningen he received an honorary PhD title in 1914. Van Anrooy continued conducting with various Dutch orchestra until 1940. While his early work mostly focused on classics such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Debussy, Ravel, Mahler and Strauss, he later paid more attention to modern Dutch composers. He also composed himself, starting from a piano piece Mars voor piano vierhandig in 1891 and ending with variations on Dutch melodies in 1937. His most known composition is Piet Hein Rhapsodie voor symfonieorkest, which was based on the Dutch song De Zilvervloot (Spanish treasure fleet) by J.J. Viotta en J.P. Heije. After World War II, between 1947 and 1954 he broadcast a weekly educational radio program at AVRO on understanding classical music. Van Anrooy had a strong character and was active politically. In 1933 he signed a document Bruinboek van de Hitler-terreur en de Rijksdagbrand (lit. Brown book of Hilter terror and the Reichstag fire) and as a result, his music was banned during the war. In 1937 refused to conduct the Nazi song Horst-Wessel-Lied at the marriage of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld and Juliana of the Netherlands. On 29 November 1906 van Anrooy married Frederique Johanna Adolphina de l'Espinasse; they had two daughters.

It adopted its current name in 2015. The Health Australia Party first contested an election under that name in 2016, where it secured almost 1.2% of first preference votes in New South Wales and less than 0.5% in three other states. The party also contested the 2018 Victorian state election, running for five legislative council seats. The party has been criticised in the main for being anti-vaccination, although the party itself has denied this. In addition, criticisms have been levelled concerning their views on pseudoscience, alternative medicine, and conspiracy theories, as well as for its policies and misleading name. Policies and philosophy According to its website, the party was founded with a view to “promoting open and transparent Government decision making, balance and honesty of information, and stimulating individual freedom of choice and thought.” Party co-founder Dr Isaac Golden has written that the party was founded, in part, \\"to respond to the well funded, sustained and coordinated attacks on natural medicine in Australia which have placed our homeopathic profession at risk, as well as all natural therapists\\". The party's policies are based on five pillars: people, economy, environment, democracy, and society. The party's president, Kerry Bone, stated on the party's website that, \\"True freedom of choice in health care, facilitated by a supportive and empathetic government and informed by balanced media representation, is what we seek.\\" According to the ABC, the party \\"also supports animal rights, food cooperatives, the Tobin tax system, which supports the taxing of foreign currency transactions, more academic freedom in universities, a Swiss-style national service system, and greater restrictions on herbicides and pesticides\\". = Criticism of 'No Jab, No Pay/Play' legislation = During the 2016 elections, the HAP opposed the Coalition's 'no jab, no pay' (also 'no jab, no play') legislation. On its website, the party describes its criticism of the \\"no jab, no pay\\" legislation as support for informed consent, and expresses concern about penalising unvaccinated children by excluding them from preschool. HAP cites the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, who also opposed the regulation, and references vaccinations programs in Denmark and Japan, which provide less coverage than the Australian system but produce excellent results in controlling disease. = Ideological criticisms = Steven Novella, a neurologist most notable for his work within the skeptics community, has written that the party subscribes to the Big Pharma conspiracy theory and takes a number of pseudoscientific and anti-science stances such as promoting homeopathy and claiming that electro-smog gives rise to electromagnetic hypersensitivity. Novella writes that \\"The HAP appears to be just a group of CAM practitioners trying to use the political process to advance their quack profession\\". Professor John Dwyer of the Australian Health Reform Alliance stated during the 2016 election campaign that he was \\"concerned\\" that the party could be elected based on its polling position in New South Wales, saying, \\"Even allowing that they're well-intentioned, the policies that they're putting forward are dangerous and frankly ignorant.\\" Andrew Miller of the Australian Medical Association charged that the party's new name was misleading, stating, \\"There should be some requirement of honesty in the way that these party names are put forward and I think this is getting pretty close to the borderline of being exactly the opposite of what its name suggests.\\"  History  The Natural Medicine Party was founded in 2013 by naturopath Andrew Patterson. It was involved in Glenn Druery's Minor Party Alliance. The party was rebranded in 2015 after 'common goals' were found between the Natural Medicine Party and four other persons to create the Health Australia Party. At the 2016 Australian federal election, the party fielded senate candidates for New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia. It was drawn the advantageous first position on the ballot in New South Wales, with Andrew Patterson the lead candidate. The party gained less than 0.5% of first-preference votes in each state except New South Wales where it gained slightly over 1%. During the campaign, the party came under fire for their apparent anti-vaccination policies, including by the Australian Medical Association, and the Green Party. The party denied this, with party spokesman Jason Woodforth telling ABC News that the lack of support for the 'no jab, no play' legislation in Victoria did not mean it was anti-vaccination, and went on to say that the party \\"believes in safe and effective immunisation [and] always has.\\" The party contested the 2018 Victorian state election, aiming for legislative council seats in the Southern Metro, Northern Metro, Eastern Metro, Western Metro and Eastern Victoria regions. The party is fielding candidates at the 2019 Australian federal election.

Personal snapshots are rigorously reworked to become subtle mementos of universal significance: ‘what’s in a life?’ we are constantly prompted to ask.” The British Museum Noda Tetsuya Biographical details All works of Tetsuya Noda 1964-1978 CiNi book list ( Japanese Art - Masterpieces in the British Museum (OXFORD) also has quotation) In the video entitled \\"Making Beauty: Noda Tetsuya\\", published by The British Museum on October 11, 2018, Noda and Clark discuss the concept and technique used in achieving the look and feel of the Noda's works. = Concept = Since 1968, Noda’s works have been inspired by themes of his own life. It is a visual autobiography and the motif is a comment on his daily life - his family, people he knows, his children’s growth and scenery along his way. He takes photographs of what he sees and likes, then develops and retouches them with pencil or brushes. His works are done using materials close at hand. News issue No.175 of The National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, January 1, 1983 written by Nobuharu Kawamoto - search result of CiNii Summer Vacation special issue of Tetsuya Noda - The museum of modern art, Wakayama On the concept of visual autobiography, Robert Flynn Johnson stated, \\"To think that one's life is important enough to make it the focus of one's art can be an act of pure folly and egotistical pride or it can involve a humbling and sincere self- examination that draw on observation of small universal truths. It is clear that in a career of nearly forty years of creating an artistic world made at paper and ink, Tetsuya Noda has followed the latter, quieter path.\\" Days in a Life : The Art of Tetsuya Noda by Robert Flynn JOHNSON In the age of social media, some critics are quick to see the parallelism of Noda's visual autobiography and popular social media sites. In 2016, a newspaper pointed out \\"In this era of social networking, it isn’t unusual for our friends to frequently post photos of the mundane happenings of our lives—a laughing baby, a just-read book, our lunch, a selfie—on Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. But for renowned contemporary Japanese artist Tetsuya Noda, documenting the ordinary details of his daily life is something he has done for almost 50 years.\\" We Use Facebook, This Artist Uses Prints, July 29, 2016 When asked about how he found his theme; “Diary as an opportunity”, he replied, “at the university I was not at all satisfied with the assignment of painting nudes, it did not seem the right way to express myself.” His independent thinking and determination were highly rewarded. “I started to use a mimeograph cutting machine for the photo images in addition to the woodblock printmaking techniques.” In 1968, four years after he graduated from the university, he received the International Grand Prize at the 6th Tokyo International Print Biennale; “for the audacious combination of photography with traditional woodblock print.\\"Prints art magazine Hanga Geijutsu Abe Publishing Ltd. / Issue 134 (2006) Tadayoshi Nakabayashi \\"lucked criticism and review\\" etc. = Techniques = Each print is created through a unique and multilayered method he himself developed. He begins by selecting a photograph, taken on the day of the title, that he manipulates in various ways. First he adds drawn elements—such as lines or shading—and whites out other aspects of the image. The altered photo is then scanned in an old-fashioned mimeograph machine, a process that creates a stencil of the image. Next Noda takes a sheet of handmade Japanese paper which he uses for all of his prints and applies subtle color through traditional woodblock technique. Finally he silkscreens his manipulated photo over the top and adds his signature, his name along with an inked thumbprint.\\"Noda Tetsuya: My Life in Print\\". = Photography = On the use of photographs, Noda concluded the difference between his approach to photography and that of the Pop artist, \\"Andy Warhol used photographs of Marilyn Monroe and Jacqueline Onassis (then Kennedy), but notice that the subjects are famous people, and the photographs themselves had already appeared dozens of times in the mass media. I never use photos taken by other people. My photos are all my own.\\" Japanese art critic Yoshiaki Tono (one of the “three greats” of Japanese art criticism) MoMA Post - Notes on Modern & Contemporary Art Around the Globe pointed out that \\"Where the Pop artists are concerned with America, with the iconography of a particular age and culture, with anonymous colloquialisms, Noda deals with something much more personal. His main subject is ordinariness - the ordinariness of individual people. Warhol's \\"Jackie\\" is the face of a whole period in American life. Imposed on it is an image of Americana during the convulsive sixties. Noda's 1968 prints are of a different dimension.\\" Tetsuya Noda : the works 1964-1978, published by Fuji Television Gallery (1978) = Education = As an educator, April Vollmer, artist and author of \\"Japanese Woodblock Print Workshop: A Modern Guide to the Ancient Art of Mokuhanga\\" wrote, \\"Today most art training takes place in universities, and two prominent Japanese artists—Tetsuya Noda at Tokyo University of the Arts (Tokyo Geijutsu Daigaku) and Akira Kurosaki at Kyoto Seika University—are largely responsible for the new international wave of Mokuhanga (Woodblock printing in Japan) awareness. Noda headed the woodblock department at Tokyo Geidai from 1991 until his retirement in 2007. Cultural exchange and the promotion of Japanese art forms are both part of the university’s mission, and Noda spearheaded an innovative program in which traditional Ukiyo-e master printers came each year from the Adachi Institute to work with students, providing a link between the traditional workshop system and the modern university. He also nurtured contacts with the West, and his 2004 retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Asian Art clearly showed the influence of his study of Western art, combining Mokuhanga backgrounds photo-screenprinted scenes of everyday life. In 1998 Noda came to Columbia University’s LeRoy Neiman Center for Print Studies to teach mokuhanga to New York area printmakers. Many of the artists now teaching mokuhanga internationally studied with Noda, including Seiichiro Miida (who has now taken Noda’s place at Tokyo Geidai), Raita Miyadera (also at Tokyo Geidai), Michael Schneider (Austria), Tyler Starr (US), Roslyn Kean (Australia), and others from Turkey to Korea to Pakistan.\\" Art In Print, July – August 2012, Volume 2, Number 2, Mokuhanga International by April Vollmer  Evaluation  Lawrence Smith, formerly Keeper of Japanese Antiquities at The British Museum wrote, \\"He is a master in at least four artistic genres , all of them closely related to painting. If considered as a printmaker, no Japanese can remotely equal his range of subject… Noda is unquestionably the greatest Japanese printmaker alive. But if considered as a creator of work very close to painting, one has also to ask what living Japanese could be considered his equal… but in my view not one of them can rival his remarkable range of subjects and emotions\\". Tetsuya Noda – Untiring Observer of the Mysteries of Existence by Lawrence Smith, published in Tetsuya Noda The Works 1964 - 2016 Edward Lucie-Smith, English art critic, curator and broadcaster, on “Japanese artists who have built major international careers”, and in the context of Yayoi Kusama’s “distinctively Japanese extension of the Pop sensibility”, and Takashi Murakami’s “traditionally Japanese origins of their imagery”, situated between them is, “Another well-known Japanese artist who stresses the international, cross-cultural aspect of his work is Tetsuya Noda. Noda’s visual diaries tell the story of his mixed marriage to an Israeli woman, using photo-based imagery. the most obviously Japanese thing about them is their immaculately skillful use of print-making techniques.” Art Today by Edward Lucie-Smith Mário Pedrosa, preeminent critic of art, culture, and politics and one of Latin America's most frequently cited public intellectuals, in a letter to Noda, praised, \\"Since the Bienal (sic) of Prints, when I had the joy of taking contact with your creative work, I always thought of how original and strong was the expression of your art.” Daniel Bell talking about the originality of Noda's prints says, \\"Noda's distinctiveness lies in three things: the remarkably consistent subject matter of his work, the structure and configurations of his compositions, and the novel techniques, consciously derived from Ukiyo-e, as the means of realizing his intentions.\\" Japanese Art Society of America (ex Ukiyo-e Society of America) UKIYO-E SOCIETY BULLETIN - Winter 2001 Robert Flynn Johnson, curator in charge of the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Arts at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco wrote, “it is Tetsuya Noda who stands as the most original, innovative, and thought- provoking Japanese printmaker of his era\\". Steven Co, art collector wrote, \\"Tetsuya Noda’s Diary Series is a visual map of temporal, personal, experiential, and lyrical moments. Noda strives to preserve memory with the objectivity of his camera, but then disrupts the resulting photograph with the subjectivity of his pencils and brushes before committing the memory to a print. As if to ensure that a memory is engraved into his mind, he would repeatedly retreat to that memory with rigor and vigor by personally pulling each print by hand. The result and effect are quiet and understated accounts of memories revisited, reassessed, and repeatedly asserted through this labor- intensive process. Mr. Noda’s works are as much about the process of making them as the pleasingly introspective and sensitive result of a single work or his whole body of works\\". The Diary of Tetsuya Noda - Steven Co Collection Yusuke Nakahara, art critic (one of the “three greats” of Japanese art criticism), wrote on Tetsuya Noda's use of photograph in his works, \\"Noda has succeeded in capturing the unique quality that had been captured in any other photographic art work before which could only be seen through a camera. This is the special quality that Noda possesses that others have difficulty to realize in their work. That is the recollective quality that a photograph evokes which one must say gives a photograph its unique quality. This recollected quality is none other than the ability that a photograph has, to record an event, that brings out the human emotion, and in Noda's works I feel that these feelings are strongly expressed.\\" Tetsuya Noda's Diary by Yusuke Nakahara, published in Tetsuya Noda The Works 1964 - 2016 Professor Linda C. Ehrlich, when writing on the relationship of Japanese visual arts and Japanese cinema, stressed not to overlook the influence of the more contemporary “creative print” (sōsaku-hanga) on Japanese films that feature a formalistic playfulness and daringness. Ehrlich stated that, “Noda Tetsuya’s large-scale diary pages based on family photographs, with their seemingly mundane, yet resonant, themes.” invokes J. Thomas Rimer’s view on sōsaku-hanga’s sense of “muted realism” and “a sense of craft rooted in instinctive apprehension of the power, the wholeness, of nature itself.” And it is this sense of “muted realism,” in which “the wholeness of nature and the everyday are joyfully celebrated.”Cinematic Landscapes: Observations on the Visual Arts and Cinema of China and Japan 1st Edition by Linda C. Ehrlich (Editor), David Desser (Editor) Emmanuel Madec, on his analysis of Tetsuya Noda's work, the photographer and curator wrote, \\"At first sight, his approach is that of a diarist. In Noda’s case, it is about an enumeration of daily objects, places, events whose banality is counterbalanced by the scale of the works. The status of subjects and objects is reversed. Diary; Feb. 14th '92 shows us an ashtray cluttered with many cigarette butts, which obviously is of great triviality; but the point of view adopted for the photograph makes it graphically remarkable. It is the format of this image (89.6 x 129.5 cm) that gives an aura to this object of which, while so commonplace at first sight, puts it front and centre as a marker of time. The object is now not only an object, it becomes a situation. With Noda, he is first a photographer. Taking pictures serves the need to check on reality. Then, discovering the image always comes from the separation between reality, memory and image, between which we can witness the gaps. But what is most striking here is that the process is transversely extended from engraving and then to screen printing. Extending the photographic image to a second medium is both over-appropriation and over- exploitation of the matter / image to extract possibilities. Noda's images thus pose as hybrids, the fruit of interbreeding between photography and engraving, propitious to probing into the profound essence of existence. Because Tetsuya Noda’s Diary is part of an elaboration of time: time of existence and time of the work that the serial reproduction confirms; therefore a proof and affirmation of the personal history of its author, as imprint of his attempt to take on time.\\" Bientôt déjà hier, catalog published by Centre de la Gravure et de l’image imprimée, edited by Catherine de Braekeleer (2019/5326/1) Alan G. Artner, an art critic, wrote \\"Many of the gratifications here come from the craft that late 20th Century art tended to downplay. The artist looks to have been unmoved by any fad or fashion and unashamedly demonstrates again and again how much work really goes into a work of art. If his exploration of friends and family does not hold your interest, the personal way in which he sets everything down may very well, as it shows a powerful melding of tradition and individual talent. Everything he sees is firm and solid and viewed with winning appreciation.\\" Delicacy in prints is Noda's hallmark by Alan G. Artner, CHICAGO TRIBUNE Gilles Bechet, an art critic, wrote \\"Contemplative explorer of everyday life, the Japanese artist (Tetsuya Noda) transposes his works into a diary in images of a disturbing sweetness that mix photography, drawing, screen printing and woodblock. An overflowing ashtray, fruits from the market, a shelf full of banal objects or candid portraits of his daughter, their pictorial treatment acquired the density of suspended time. A time that will not come back but remains archived forever.\\" \\" Le Temps S’Imprime À La Louviere by Gilles Bechet, MU IN THE CITY - VISUAL ARTS MAGAZINE, May 31, 2019 Joey Ho Chong I, art curator, wrote \\"Noda's Diary series reminds me of an adapted quote from Qing dynasty poet ZhaWeiren: what used to be the zither, chess, wine and flowers in calligraphy and painting; is now the rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar and tea. It is extraordinary that ordinary things in life, under the unique interpretation of Noda, can possess such intelligence and timelessness, making things strange yet intimate. His works allow us to walk through his life and make us feel as if we were part of him or his family. We can silently experience his joys and sorrows, and quietly walk along with him through his life journey. It is his ability to negotiate with that close and distant home in his heart that allows us to understand the meaning of life in the ordinary.\\" Your Hand in Mine, Tetsuya Noda (Diary) Selected Works - Steven Co Collection, Joey Ho Chong I, Steven Co, Arts Empowering Lab, 2019 Janice Katz, Associate Curator of Japanese Art at the Art Institute Chicago wrote, “his focus on familiar and personal imagery almost feels like an attempt to stop time. The intensely personal subject matter of his images are in contrast to his printmaking technique, which renders his subjects mysterious and veiled. They are a bit hazy and unclear, creating a distance between the viewer and the image. The loving care that Noda expends on the creation of a print, making it beautiful and detailed, infusing it with mystery and uncertainty, makes me think that he is not preserving memory so much as creating the scene the way it appears in his memory. In the process of creation, he gets to spend more time with each of these moments—the wish of every parent, surely—even as he alters them.\\" Noda Tetsuya: Negotiating Memory by Janice Katz, Associate Curator of Japanese Art, Art Institute Chicago, April 28, 2020  Public collections  Tetsuya Noda's works are widely collected around the world by both generalist museums (national museums, fine art museums, modern art museum and contemporary art museums) and specialist museums (photography, print and graphic art).

After a period of collective rule, an election was held at the party's Perth conference in February 2005 to find a new National Convener. It resulted in the election of Colin Fox as Sheridan's successor.  Candidates  Any member of the Scottish Socialist Party was eligible to stand in the election. Nominations were to be accepted until the first week in December, though this deadline eventually became 23 January 2005. Two candidates contested the election. Fox announced his intention to stand for the position shortly after Sheridan's resignation, saying he was \\"prepared to step up to the plate and offer my services to the party for consideration as the national spokesperson\\". His sole opponent, McCombes, announced his candidacy five days before nominations closed. McCombes joined the race in order to avoid the \\"coronation\\" of an unopposed candidate. Carolyn Leckie was, for a time, thought likely to stand but did not.  Campaign  Sheridan initially refused to name his preferred successor, but later emerged as one of Fox's backers. Fox was supported by two of the party's other MSPsSheridan and Rosemary Byrnewhile McCombes was backed by three: Rosie Kane, Carolyn Leckie, and Frances Curran. In the grassroots membership, Fox found greater support in the east of Scotland and McCombes found greater support in the west. Fox had been a full-time organiser for the party in the Lothians for five years before his election in 2003, and said those who had voted for McCombes were based \\"principally in Glasgow\\". A principal issue in the election was whether or not the party should be led by an MSP. The Scotsman reported: \\"There is little separating [Fox and McCombes] ideologically, so the contest is largely a matter of style and personality. And one of the key issues has become whether the SSP should be led from inside the Scottish Parliament or outside.\\" McCombes said he wanted the party to engage with non-voters who had \\"been abandoned by the political elites\\", and argued that he was \\"a real political heavyweight, capable of standing up to big beasts of the jungle like Alex Salmond, Charles Kennedy and John Reid\\". Fox argued that \\"electing a non-MSP as convener would make the job ten times more difficult\\" and that he didn't think McCombes \\"would get invited to many meetings because he wouldn't be an elected representative\\".  Process  The party formally decided to end collective rule and proceed with the election in a National Council meeting in December 2004, at which there was \\"a full and frank discussion on the options for the leadership\\". Regardless, the question was revisited at the party conference, which discussed four options for governing the party: *Continuing with collective leadership by MSPs *Collective leadership by another group of 5-6 people *Election of two co- conveners *Election of a single convener The conference eventually voted through a motion proposing the establishment of a commission to \\"investigate the existing structures, organisation, culture and constitution of the party\\", then proceeded with the election of a single convener. Delegates were invited to cast a vote for either of the nominated candidates. There were 406 votes cast for either Fox or McCombes, with a total of 9 abstentions and 1 spoilt ballot. Fox won by a majority of 98, despite speculation that the vote would be close.  Aftermath  After his election, Fox said the party would \\"unite and focus on regaining the confidence of the 130,000 people who voted for us in the 2003 election\\". He also said he would ensure no division between the party's MSPs and its grassroots activists, saying: \\"I want to go to those who voted for Alan, principally in Glasgow, and reassure them that rank-and-file democracy is safe in my hands.\\" Sheridan said he would strive to \\"unify the party behind Colin's convenership\\", and said Fox's 98 vote majority \\"makes it all the more likely that this party will now get back to what it is good at, which is fighting the Tories, fighting capitalism, fighting wars, instead of having internal squabbles\\". By August 2006, however, Sheridan began manoeuvring to retake the party leadership and said he had absolutely no confidence in Fox, who lacked the \\"steel\\" to lead the SSP out of its present crisis. Sheridan eventually formed a splinter organisation and left the SSP before another leadership contest could take place.

She spent 53 years at the Newark Public Library in Newark, New Jersey and was its third librarian, from 1929 to 1942.  Early life  Winser was the eldest child of Henry Jacob Winser, an American newspaper reporter and diplomat, and Edith Cox Winser, daughter of physician Dr. Henry G. Cox and herself a newspaper contributor. Soon after Winser's birth in Newark, New Jersey, Henry Winser left The New York Times for a post as consul to Saxe- Coburg and Gotha, which he held until 1881. Winser was educated in Germany and learned English, French, and German.  Career  Winser attended the Columbia University Library School in 1888, the first library school in the United States, founded by Melvil Dewey and first open to students the previous year. She joined the Newark Public Library as a French and German cataloger in 1889. In 1894, she became assistant librarian under Frank P. Hill, the first librarian of the Newark Public Library. Hill left in 1901 to run the Brooklyn Public Library, leaving Winser in charge of the library for seven months. While conceding that Winser was qualified for the job, the trustees preferred a male librarian for the position and John Cotton Dana assumed the position in 1902. Despite the inauspicious beginning, Winser and Dana had a productive working relationship until his death in 1929. During this time, she became the first woman in Newark to join a governing body when in 1915 she became a member of the Newark Board of Education. She also campaigned against restrictions preventing women from working in military libraries during World War I, served as president of the New Jersey Library Association, from 1907-1908 and 1921-1922, and in 1923 campaigned against state labor legislation that would prevent women from working during the evening hours. Winser assumed leadership of the Library and the Newark Museum, which Dana founded in 1909. She headed both institutions during the Great Depression, which strained budgets and required scaling back services and renovations. In the 1930s, she served as chair of the New Jersey Art Division of the Works Progress Administration, was active in the campaign against appointing Archibald MacLeish as Librarian of Congress due to his lack of professional library experience, involved in the foundation of Dana College and was awarded an honorary LL.D. after its merger with the University of Newark, and fought against censorship of foreign materials by the United States Customs Service. During World War II, Winser presided over efforts to satisfy new information needs due to the war and to provide books to soldiers. In 1942, she resigned from the library, citing the interference of trustees in management of the library, namely overriding personnel assignments. She continued to head the Newark Museum until shortly before her death in 1947 of heart disease.

Founded by the Roman Catholic religious institute the Salesians of Don Bosco, it is located at Chai Wan Road, Shau Kei Wan, Hong Kong Island. The school's patron saint is Blessed Filippo Rinaldi and the motto is \\"Alere Flammam\\". History In 1941, due to the great demand at the time, the Salesians of Don Bosco established the Salesian Children's Home under the Salesian Seminary, the progenitor of the Salesian English School. The school was operated by the Salesian China Province of Mary Help of Christians. The primary section of the Salesian English School was established in 1950 with the secondary section following in 1955. In 1959, the first senior secondary students sat for the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. The construction of the house of the secondary section was completed and started to operate in the same year. Then Hong Kong Governor Sir Robert Brown Black was invited as guest in the opening ceremony. The new indoor playground and new wing construction project were launched in 1966 and completed in 1972. Three years later, the school has joined the scheme of subsidy school (DSS). In the 1990s, the first female teacher was employed at the school, which had not happened since the opening year. Entering the 21st century, the school has proposed reform schemes in improving teaching methods and campus environment. To help students adapt the technology-orientated era, the school was renovated and new equipment was imported to assist the new education system. Due to the education reform in 2000, the school was classified as CMI school which has gravely affected the future development of the school. In 2018, the “Hing Yik Footbridge” had been damaged in an accident and was permanently removed. 節錄自2000-2001年度慈幼學校五十周年金禧校慶紀念特刊 Notable Alumni *Tony F.
