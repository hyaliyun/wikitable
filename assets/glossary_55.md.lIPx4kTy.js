Since Maradona retired, people have been anticipating someone to lead the Argentine national team to a World Cup final, like Maradona did twice. As a consequence, very talented youngsters are quickly labeled as a New Maradona (for example Lionel Messi or Juan Rom√°n Riquelme), sometimes without any similarity in playing style (such as Franco Di Santo). The New Maradonas are predominantly players in attacking or advanced playmaking roles ‚Äî forwards, wingers, or attacking midfielders.  Lionel Messi  Lionel Messi has been named as the \\"New Maradona\\" by Maradona himself Although still widely contested among Argentine football players, in recent times the title has been attached to FC Barcelona forward Lionel Messi, an assertion supported by Maradona himself. Maradona and Messi worked together as manager and player for Argentina's national side at the 2010 World Cup, the former thoroughly impressed with the latter's skills. On 18 April 2007, Messi scored a goal against Getafe CF which was very similar to Maradona's Goal of the Century, scored against England in the 1986 World Cup. The world's sports press exploded with Maradona comparisons, and the Spanish press labeled Messi \\"Messidona\\". On 9 June 2007, in a match against RCD Espanyol, Messi scored a goal using his hand, which drew comparison to the Hand of God goal scored by Maradona in the same World Cup match. On 12 March 2013, Messi scored two goals, and helped create the fourth, to help Barcelona defeat A.C. Milan (4‚Äì0) in the 2nd leg of their Champions League game and reach the quarter-finals. Messi's opening goal of the match once again drew further comparisons between himself and Maradona, due to the similarity with Maradona's famous goal against Greece in the 1994 World Cup. Messi has largely been compared to Maradona due to their similar playing style, skill set and short stature. Their lower centre of gravity allows them to be more agile and change direction more quickly, helping them to evade tackles, and their short legs allow them to excel in short bursts of acceleration, and to keep control of the ball when dribbling at speed. Both players have played and worn the number 10 shirt for Barcelona and, like Maradona before him, Messi is also predominantly a left footed player. Messi's passing, dribbling, vision, eye for goal and playmaking ability have also drawn comparisons to Maradona. Like Maradona, Messi is also an accurate set piece and penalty kick taker. With regard to his dribbling ability and ball control, Maradona has said of Messi: \\"The ball stays glued to his foot; I‚Äôve seen great players in my career, but I‚Äôve never seen anyone with Messi's ball control.\\" Maradona has stated that he believes Messi to currently be the greatest player in the world. Although Messi is regarded as being a more offensive player for Barcelona, he has also played in a more similar position to Maradona, in particular for Argentina, where he is predominantly used as an attacking midfielder, as a deep-lying forward, or as a winger, rather than as a striker or as a false-9. Like Maradona, Messi is considered to be one of the greatest players both of his generation and of all time. Like Maradona, Messi won the FIFA World Youth Championship, in 2005 with Argentina, and won the Golden Ball. Coincidentally, both players made their national debut against Hungary, and Messi also went on to inherit Maradona's number 10 shirt and role as captain for Argentina. Messi would first wear the number 10 jersey and the captain's armband at an international tournament in the 2010 World Cup, under Maradona as coach. In 2014, Messi captained Argentina, leading them to their first World Cup final since Maradona had last brought them there as captain in 1990, where Argentina were once again defeated 1‚Äì0 by Germany. Like Maradona in 1986, Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, scoring four goals and providing an assist. With this achievement, Maradona and Messi are the only players to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup, with Maradona doing so in 1979 and 1986, while Messi managed the same feat in 2005 and in 2014. Like Maradona in 1986, Messi also made the most successful dribbling runs of any other player throughout the tournament, and knocked out Belgium on the way to the final, drawing further comparisons between the two players. During the tournament, Messi's passionate celebration after scoring the match winning goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina was compared to Maradona's famous goal celebration against Greece in 1994. Furthermore, images surfaced which compared the heavy marking both players faced by the opposition defence at the World Cup. Like Maradona again in 1986, Messi was involved in the vast majority of Argentina's goals. In Argentina's final group match of the 2018 FIFA World Cup against Nigeria at the Krestovsky Stadium, Saint Petersburg on 26 June, Messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2‚Äì1 victory, becoming the third Argentine after Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta to score in three different World Cups. In the round of 16 match against France on 30 June, Messi set up Gabriel Mercado's and Sergio Ag√ºero's goals in a 4‚Äì3 defeat, which saw Argentina eliminated from the World Cup. With his two assists in his team's second round fixture, Messi became the first player to provide two assists in a match for Argentina since Diego Maradona had managed the same feat against South Korea in 1986.

It is part of the device mapper infrastructure, and uses cryptographic routines from the kernel's Crypto API. Unlike its predecessor cryptoloop, dm-crypt was designed to support advanced modes of operation, such as XTS, LRW and ESSIV (see disk encryption theory for further information), in order to avoid watermarking attacks. In addition to that, dm-crypt also addresses some reliability problems of cryptoloop. dm- crypt is implemented as a device mapper target and may be stacked on top of other device mapper transformations. It can thus encrypt whole disks (including removable media), partitions, software RAID volumes, logical volumes, as well as files. It appears as a block device, which can be used to back file systems, swap or as an LVM physical volume. Some Linux distributions support the use of dm-crypt on the root file system. These distributions use initrd to prompt the user to enter a passphrase at the console, or insert a smart card prior to the normal boot process. Frontends The dm-crypt device mapper target resides entirely in kernel space, and is only concerned with encryption of the block device it does not interpret any data itself. It relies on user space front-ends to create and activate encrypted volumes, and manage authentication. At least two frontends are currently available: \`cryptsetup\` and \`cryptmount\`. =cryptsetup= The \`cryptsetup\` command-line interface, by default, does not write any headers to the encrypted volume, and hence only provides the bare essentials: encryption settings have to be provided every time the disk is mounted (although usually employed with automated scripts), and only one key can be used per volume; the symmetric encryption key is directly derived from the supplied passphrase. Because it lacks a \\"salt\\", using cryptsetup is less secure in this mode than is the case with Linux Unified Key Setup (LUKS). However, the simplicity of cryptsetup makes it useful when combined with third-party software, for example, with smart card authentication. \`cryptsetup\` also provides commands to deal with the LUKS on-disk format. This format provides additional features such as key management and key stretching (using PBKDF2), and remembers encrypted volume configuration across reboots. =cryptmount= The \`cryptmount\` interface is an alternative to the \\"cryptsetup\\" tool that allows any user to mount and unmount a dm-crypt file system when needed, without needing superuser privileges after the device has been configured by a superuser. Features The fact that disk encryption (volume encryption) software like dm-crypt only deals with transparent encryption of abstract block devices gives it a lot of flexibility. This means that it can be used for encrypting any disk-backed file systems supported by the operating system, as well as swap space; write barriers implemented by file systems are preserved. Encrypted volumes can be stored on disk partitions, logical volumes, whole disks as well as file-backed disk images (through the use of loop devices with the losetup utility). dm- crypt can also be configured to encrypt RAID volumes and LVM physical volumes. dm-crypt can also be configured to provide pre-boot authentication through an initrd, thus encrypting all the data on a computer except the bootloader, the kernel and the initrd image itself. When using the cipher block chaining mode of operation with predictable initialization vectors as other disk encryption software, the disk is vulnerable to watermarking attacks. This means that an attacker is able to detect the presence of specially crafted data on the disk. To address this problem in its predecessors, dm-crypt included provisions for more elaborate, disk encryption-specific modes of operation. Support for ESSIV (encrypted salt-sector initialization vector) was introduced in Linux kernel version 2.6.10, LRW in 2.6.20 and XTS in 2.6.24. The Linux Crypto API includes support for most popular block ciphers and hash functions, which are all usable with dm-crypt. Crypted FS support include LUKS volumes, loop-AES and since Linux kernel 3.13, the TrueCrypt target called \\"tcw\\". Compatibility dm-crypt and LUKS encrypted disks can be accessed and used under MS Windows using the now defunct FreeOTFE (formerly DoxBox, LibreCrypt), provided that the filesystem used is supported by Windows (e.g. FAT/FAT32/NTFS). Encrypted ext2 and ext3 filesystems are supported by using Ext2Fsd or so-called \\"Ext2 Installable File System for Windows\\"; FreeOTFE also supports them. Cryptsetup/LUKS and the required infrastructure have also been implemented on the DragonFly BSD operating system.

As a member of the Irish Parliamentary Party he represented North Donegal (1890‚Äì92) and as a Parnellite Member he represented West Clare (1892‚Äì95). He was a friend and associate of Cecil Rhodes (1853‚Äì1902), and was one of the three men who signed the original concession on which was based the British South Africa Company, of which he was president in 1923‚Äì25. Life and career He was the second son of John Mullock Maguire, rector of Kilkeedy, co. Limerick, and his wife Anne Jane n√©e Humphreys. He was educated at Cheltenham College and Merton College, Oxford, where he obtained first classes in mathematics and jurisprudence. He was elected a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford in 1878 and was called to the bar in 1883, although he never practised the law. He married Julia Beatrice, eldest daughter of Viscount Peel, a former Speaker of the House of Commons, in 1895. While at Oxford, Maguire became friendly with Cecil Rhodes. In 1888, Rhodes sent him with Charles Rudd and Francis Thompson to negotiate a concession of land and mineral rights in Matabeleland from Chief Lobengula at Bulawayo. This was signed on 30 October. The British South Africa Company was chartered the following October and Maguire was associated with it for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, in 1888, Rhodes had reached an agreement with Parnell, whom he admired. Rhodes supported Home Rule for Ireland, but saw it as only part of an Imperial federal scheme for the whole British Empire in which all the self-governing territories would send members to the Imperial Parliament. He therefore objected to the terms of Gladstone's unsuccessful Home Rule Bill of 1886, which would have ended Irish representation at Westminster. He gave Parnell ¬£10,000 for the Irish Party's funds in exchange for an undertaking that the Party would promote the continuation of Irish members at Westminster (in the event both later Home Rule Bills, in 1893 and 1912, did provide for this). Maguire, who shared Rhodes' admiration for Parnell, became the main link between Rhodes and Parnell, and a seat was found for him at an uncontested by-election at North Donegal in June 1890. Less than six months later, however, the Irish Party split over Parnell's leadership. Maguire continued his support for Parnell, and, after Parnell's death in October 1891, for the embattled Parnellites. This meant that he was faced with a real fight at the general election of 1892. Then, he contested West Clare, defeating the Anti-Parnellite candidate convincingly by over 1,000 votes. However, at the following general election in 1895, after the destruction of the second Home Rule Bill by the House of Lords in 1894, Maguire lost the seat to a fresh Anti-Parnellite candidate, by 403 votes. His later career was almost entirely concerned with South and central Africa. He went through the Siege of Kimberley in the Boer War with Rhodes, accompanied by his wife. After Rhodes' death in 1902, Maguire carried on his work as a businessman, in the British South Africa Company, as a director of the Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa, and particularly in the development of the Rhodesian railway system of which he was chairman for many years. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1918 New Year Honours for his efforts during the First World War. According to The Times, among dozens of friends and associates from his imperial career who attended his funeral on 24 April 1925, there was only one representative of the Irish nationalist movement, namely his former Parnellite colleague John O'Connor.

World War II During World War II, the 98th initially defended Kauai, Hawaii and Maui, Hawaii, and finally responsible for defending Oahu, Hawaii later in the war. The Division began intensive training in May 1945 to prepare for the invasion of Japan, but the war ended before they could depart Hawaii. However, the unit arrived in Japan for occupation duty as the 3rd Platoon, 98th Reconnaissance Troop Mechanized, of the 98th Infantry Division, where it eventually was inactivated on 16 February 1946, in Charlotte, NC. Service in the Vietnam War The brigade was reactivated in September 1965 at Fort Devens Massachusetts, where it was originally scheduled to be sent to the Dominican Republic. Instead, the Army rushed it to Vietnam, the Brigade departing on 15 July 1966 via transport ships and arriving on 14 August 1966 at T√¢y Ninh Combat Base. It began operations almost immediately in the western area of III Corps Tactical Zone. The brigade conducted Operation Cedar Falls, Gadsden, Lancaster, Junction City, Benton, and Attleboro (in War Zone C of Tay Ninh Province). Attleboro turned into a major action after a large enemy base camp was found on 19 October 1966. In April 1967, Gen. William Westmoreland ordered the formation of a division sized Army task force to reinforce American forces in I Corps Tactical Zone. The 196th was selected to form a part of the task force. Task Force Oregon became operational on 20 April 1967, when troops from the 196th landed at Chu Lai Base Area in I Corps. Over the next month, it was joined by the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division and the 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division (later redesignated the 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division). In September 1967 Task Force Oregon was redesignated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal) and an official change of colors ceremony was held on 26 October 1967.http://www.buffgrunt.com/history/taskforce.html Later, the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne and the 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division were replaced by the 198th and 11th Light Infantry Brigades. As part of the 23rd, the 196th participated in Operations Wheeler/Wallowa, Golden Fleece, Fayette Canyon, Frederick Hill, Lamar Plain, Elk Canyon I and Elk Canyon II. In early May 1968, the 2-1 Infantry of the 196th was flown in to assist at the Battle of Kham Duc. An entire company of the 196th was also involved in opposing the war by famously sitting down on the battlefield. On 29 November 1971, the 196th became a separate temporary entity to safeguard this same area of operations. In April 1972, the 196th moved to Da Nang to assist in port security duties, and finally left Vietnam on 29 June 1972 as the last combat brigade to leave in Vietnam. The 196th served in Vietnam from 15 July 1966 through 29 June 1972. The brigade suffered 1,188 KIA, and 5,591 WIA in Vietnam.

The newly reflagged brigade, previously designated as the Training Support Brigade Pacific, is organized as a Training Support Brigade, and is assigned to United States Army Pacific (USARPAC). The 196th Infantry Brigade provides National Defense Authorization Act Title XI pre-mobilization, post-mobilization and demobilization support to Army reserve component units in Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, the Commonwealth of Mariana Islands (CNMI), Guam, the Hawaiian Islands, Japan and the Republic of Korea. The 196th Infantry Brigade executes its mobilization operations at Mobilization Force Generation Installation (MFGI) Hawaii at Schofield Barracks and at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson (JBER), and at three Mobilization Sites, located in Guam, Japan and the Republic of Korea. The Brigade is also designated by USARPAC as the Validation Authority for reserve component forces mobilized onto Title 10 United States Code, Active Duty. Since 2001, the 196th Infantry Brigade has trained more than 10,000 Soldiers that deployed to support combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Horn of Africa, and the Southern Philippines. The 196th Infantry Brigade also supports annual USARPAC and United States Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) Theater Security Cooperation Program (TSCP) exercises such as Balikatan, Cobra Gold, Yama Sakura, Talisman Saber, Hamel, and Terminal Fury. The brigade also serves as the USARPAC executive agent for training and readiness oversight (TRO) over the Alaska, Guam and Hawaii National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Civil Support Teams (CST), and the Hawaiian Army National Guard Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and High Explosive (CBRNE) Enhanced Force Package (CERFP). In 2007, the 196th Infantry Brigade was awarded the Army Superior Unit Award for its support to the War on Terror in preparing reserve component units and Soldiers for combat duty. In 2013, USARPAC assigned the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Capability (JPMRC) to the 196th Infantry Brigade, which serves as the core of an Operations Group (OPSGROUP) for the capability. JPMRC provide enhanced live, virtual, constructive collective training opportunities to USARPAC Battalion Task Forces and Brigade Combat Teams at their home station and at sites throughout the Indo-Pacific.

In this episode, Michael prepares for his interview for the corporate job and names Dwight as his successor, whose managing methods are unpopular. Jan arrives at the office to see Michael and everyone is shocked when it appears she has undergone breast augmentation. Jim and Karen also interview for the corporate position, and Pam deals with the consequences of her earlier outburst. The episode was written by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur, and was directed by Ken Kwapis. It was cut down from an hour and twelve minutes to forty-two minutes, making it the season's second hour-long episode after \\"A Benihana Christmas\\". Kwapis carefully shot Jim's reaction shots, as he did not want to reveal Jim's choice of Karen or Pam to the audience. The cast were unaware how the season would end, as multiple endings were shot by the crew. Filming wrapped up in April 2007. The finale first aired in the United States on May 17, 2007 on NBC. An estimated 7.9 million viewers watched the episode; it earned a 3.9/12 ratings share among adults 18‚Äì49, making it rank first for the night. Television critics gave positive reviews to the finale. It won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay ‚Äì Episodic Comedy and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series. In addition, Jenna Fischer received a nomination for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. Synopsis Confident that he will get the corporate job in New York City, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) sells his condo and names Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) his successor as Regional Manager. Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) cheerfully withstands her colleagues' teasing over her speech from \\"Beach Games\\", and tells Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) that she is not sorry about what she said but regrets putting Karen in an awkward position. Meanwhile, Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) asks Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) whom he finds more attractive between Karen and Pam. Though Jim initially refuses to answer, he becomes intrigued when Kevin starts to compare the two women. He tells Kevin to keep thinking about it in a joking way, but appears to be very interested in the results. Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) arrives at the office to win Michael back. In a panic, Michael consults the women of the office. Pam tells him not to reconcile with Jan. Michael attempts to reject Jan, but reverses himself immediately when he sees that she has had a breast augmentation. Jim and Karen drive to New York City together and spend the night before their interviews. Karen tells Jim that if either of them gets the job, both should move to New York. She promises to do so, but is met with awkward silence when she asks Jim to reciprocate. Meanwhile, Dwight begins his new regime, assigning Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) the role of his number two (albeit because he is the only one to apply) and asking Pam to be his secret \\"Assistant to the Regional Manager\\". Dwight's new motivational style is not popular, and so he and Andy repaint the walls of Dwight's new office black in order to instill fear. During his interview at Corporate, Michael learns from CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) that he is interviewing for the job currently held by Jan, who will be fired. Michael goes to Jan's office after the interview and quickly bumbles into revealing her impending termination. Jan storms into Wallace's office, interrupting Karen's interview (who stated to David that Michael \\"would be a disaster\\" in the new job), and refuses to leave. After Jan is escorted out by security, Michael learns that he will not be getting the position. On the drive home, Jan tells Michael that she will make their relationship her \\"full- time job\\". Upon hearing that, Michael becomes visibly uncomfortable. Jim's interview with David goes well until he discovers an encouraging note from Pam along with a yogurt lid medal, reminiscent of the earlier episode \\"Office Olympics\\", throwing him off. Jim recalls a conversation with Pam after her confession on the beach. He discreetly admits that he left Scranton because of her rejection and that he feels that he has \\"never really come back,\\" meaning that he has been actively fighting his feelings for her. Pam tells him that she wishes that he would come back. Just as Pam is telling the cameras that she accepts that she does not think that it would work out between her and Jim, he bursts into the room and asks her out to dinner. Stunned, she agrees, and Jim says, \\"Alright. Then, it's a date.\\" After Jim exits the room, Pam becomes visibly joyous and forgets what she was talking about. During a phone call, David Wallace offers the job to Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who accepts and immediately breaks up with Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling). Production \\"The Job\\" was co-written by Paul Lieberstein, who plays Toby Flenderson on the series. \\"The Job\\" was written by Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur. It was directed by Ken Kwapis, who had, around the same time, directed The Office actors John Krasinski, Brian Baumgartner, Mindy Kaling, and Angela Kinsey in the 2007 film License to Wed. Script reading for the episode took place on a beach during the filming of the season's twenty-third episode, \\"Beach Games\\". Actress Kate Flannery remarked that \\"we were so excited that we almost had another hot dog eating contest. Not. It's a great script. Lots of questions answered. Lots. The Office fans have been anxiously awaiting a one-hour episode, and guess what? You got it.\\" The original cut of the episode was an hour and twelve minutes long, and had to be edited down to forty-two minutes of screentime. It was the second Office episode to fill the entire hour timeslot; the first was the third-season episode \\"A Benihana Christmas\\". Krasinski received a haircut due to production on another film, Leatherheads (2008), which he thought \\"ended up working perfectly\\" for the season finale. Co-creator Greg Daniels had wanted Jim to get a haircut for a while, as he thought it would \\"change [him] up a little bit.\\" Krasinski thought it was \\"really smart\\" to make it seem like Karen's idea. Kwapis was careful with Jim's reaction shots in the episode, as he did not want to \\"tip anything\\" to the audience about Jim's choice of Karen or Pam. Kwapis explained, \\"That to me was actually one of the big challenges of the episode is how to keep you on your toes in terms of not knowing where the story was going.\\" Jim's flashback scene with Pam on the beach was initially intended to be the cold open of the episode before Michael Schur suggested it be moved. Kwapis shot multiple endings, and the cast was unaware how the season would end. Jenna Fischer enjoyed doing her individual scenes with Rainn Wilson because their characters rarely interacted one-on-one. The filming of these scenes took place on the last days of production for the season, and not many people were still on set. The episode finished shooting in April 2007. Two weeks before the finale, actor Oscar Nunez gave brief allusions in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, \\"There will be some movement. Major things moving. Major shifts that affect the entire office. So there's some good stuff coming up. That's all I can say.\\" Reception IGN opined that Pam's \\"reaction when Jim asks her to dinner is as honest and believable as any moment on television and reminds us why we care so much about this relationship.\\" The episode first aired in the United States on May 17, 2007, several days after NBC announced a fourth season. \\"The Job\\" attracted 7.9 million viewers and earned a 3.9/12 ratings share among adults 18 to 49. It ranked first for the night in that demographic, and was NBC's highest among adults and total viewers in its timeslot since the broadcast of \\"Cocktails\\". Among total viewers, The Office ranked third in its timeslot (behind a CBS tribute to the retiring Bob Barker and ABC's first season finale of Ugly Betty). The season finale received generally positive reviews from television critics. Entertainment Weekly columnist Abby West wrote that it \\"was hands down one of the most satisfying hours of television I have ever had the pleasure of watching,\\" explaining that it created \\"entirely new dynamics\\" for the fourth season, hit \\"all major beats,\\" and had \\"real story progression\\" and heart. Give Me My Remote writer Kath Skerry declared that the episode was \\"brilliantly written, acted, and well paced. It was filled with twists and turns that I didn‚Äôt see coming. And I know that it sounds cliche, and I know saying it sounds cliche, sounds cliche. Maybe I‚Äôm being cliche but I don‚Äôt care. I am what I am ‚Äì a full fledged Office addict who got exactly what she wanted, and in fact needed from the finale.\\" James Poniewozik of Time magazine voiced similar sentiments, believing the finale to be a \\"good if not great season-ender, and if the conclusion didn't have the holy-crap factor of The Kiss last year, Pam‚Äôs closeup reaction to Jim‚Äôs return during her interview was‚Äìlike everything Jenna Fischer does on this show‚Äìwinning and sweet.\\" Poniewozik disliked how the season left Karen, calling it \\"an uncharacteristic way to end this love triangle, which was distinguished by the writers‚Äô refusal to make anyone the bad guy.\\" IGN's Travis Fickett rated \\"The Job\\" 8.2/10. He believed that the episode \\"pulled off some rather brilliant turns\\" with the storylines concerning Jan and Jim, Karen, and Pam; additionally noting that the episode was at its weakest during Dwight's take-over scenes in Scranton since he knew Michael would be returning and that Ryan's selection \\"makes for some interesting scenarios for next season.\\" AOL TV contributor Jay Black highlighted scenes he found humorous, including Dwight's preferred choice of an assistant and Michael's reaction to Jan's implants. He gave the episode \\"7 Shrute Bucks out of 7.\\" Various cast members were also lauded for their performances, including Jenna Fischer, John Krasinski, and Melora Hardin. In an article written after the episode's broadcast, actress Kate Flannery observed that \\"lots of questions\\" were answered and that it was \\"like a movie.\\" Referring to the agreed-to date between Jim and Pam, Flannery said, \\"The point is that the elephant in the room has not only been addressed but asked to dinner. Makes Season 4 seem filled with possibilities ‚Äì like an empty glass in front of a full bar.\\" In an article written around the time of actor Steve Carell's last performance on The Office in 2011, IGN's Cindy White listed Michael's quote about Jan's \\"breast enhancement\\" as among the best of the series. Dan Philipps, another writer for IGN, ranked Jim's date proposal among the best moments for the couple, stating that \\"after toying with fans' expectations for two whole seasons, the series' writers finally allowed fans to breathe a sigh of relief. For many, the moment was well worth the wait.\\" For their writing of \\"The Job\\", Paul Lieberstein and Michael Schur won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay ‚Äì Episodic Comedy, beating The Office episodes \\"Local Ad\\" and \\"Phyllis' Wedding\\" as well as episodes of 30 Rock, Flight of the Conchords, and Pushing Daisies. At the 59th Creative Arts Emmy Awards, editors David Rogers and Dean Holland won for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Comedy Series.

It also has local Centres which organise meetings and trips of railway interest. In 1927 the SLS organised the preservation of London, Brighton and South Coast Railway B1 Class steam locomotive Gladstone; the first locomotive to be preserved by private subscription. In due course it was donated to the UK National Collection and is now in the care of the National Railway Museum.

M.E.B.A. primarily represents licensed mariners, especially deck and engine officers working in the United States Merchant Marine aboard U.S.-flagged vessels. It is a member union of the AFL‚ÄìCIO. M.E.B.A. officers work in both the oceans and the Great Lakes in many settings, including on container ships, tankers (including LNG carriers), cruise ships, drillships, tugboats and ferries, as well as in various capacities in the shoreside ship transport and marine industries and on government-contracted ships of the U.S. Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force and U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command. Merchant mariners deliver critical defense cargo to United States armed forces in times of military conflict. Members and their families benefit from M.E.B.A.'s collective bargaining agreements through the union's Medical Plan, 401(k) Plan, Pension Trust, and Vacation Plan. The M.E.B.A. History The nation's oldest maritime union was formed out of necessity in the late 19th century. The introduction of steamships in the early 1800s increased the demand of engineers needed to maintain them operating. Steamship owners on the Mississippi and Great Lakes were competing with one another and demanding greater speeds from their vessels. However, the concept of steam engines powering these ships was still relatively new and the study of marine engineering was barely starting to develop as the engineers hired learned aboard the ship. The engineers hired to manage the steam engines were shore- side engineers since the marine engineer did not exist yet. It was a completely new kind of field compared to the shore-side work they were used to. The unfamiliarity with the specifics of what engineers were working with and the fact that the steam engine was in its earliest stages meant that the ships were boarded with engineers of minimal marine engineering knowledge and unreliable machinery. This increase in speed greatly reduced safety in the engine room due to fires and boiler explosions. Even with increased risk, the wages remained the same. The ongoing injuries and deaths from working on the steamships finally motivated engineers to demand a means of safety regulations from Congress in order to acquire protection and improve their working conditions. In 1838, the first Steamboat Act was implemented, however it was very inefficient because its legislation was vague and so the tragedies on steamships continued. The lack of improvement from the Steamboat Act led to and even greater demand to make the act stronger and more efficient. This continued until 1852 when Congress passed an enhanced version of the Steamboat Act which required engineers to have a license to work on steamboats and enforced an inspection system for the machinery. The first gathering of the Buffalo Association of Engineers in 1854 an essential role model for the unionization of M.E.B.A. The Buffalo Association of Engineers implemented the topics of discussion such as wage which helped them fight wage cuts until they dismembered the association. When wages started to be cut again, cities such as Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit took after the Buffalo association and created organizations of their own. Individually, these city-wide associations were merely effective, therefore this brought on the idea to unite the one- city associations as a national movement. The Buffalo Association of Engineers began corresponding with other marine engineer associations around the country. In February 1875, the leaders of five steamship unions out of Buffalo, New York, Cleveland, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, Chicago, Illinois and Baltimore, Maryland, convened in Cleveland, Ohio to join together. This organization called itself the National Marine Engineers Association and chose Garret Douw of Buffalo as its president. (The word Beneficial was not added until 1883.) After Marine Engineers‚Äô Beneficial Association's formation, the union lobbied Washington legislators to pass bills in 1884 and 1896 that would make it law for all American vessels to only possess American officers, and to grant the ability for marine engineers to attain licenses, respectably.Marine Engineers‚Äô Beneficial Association.

Thor and Jan Moehl, Individuals (Marine Engineers‚Äô Beneficial Association, 2018). The hearings took place in San Francisco, California with twenty-seven hearing dates between August 27, 1971 and January 5, 1972.The men argued that the respondent union (M.E.B.A.) had registered and dispatched candidates from its exclusive hiring hall based on unlawful preferences and unfair considerations under the meaning Section 8(b), 2, and 1(A) of the Act and questioning if a licensed officer had authority over unlicensed personnel aboard a ship. The trial examiner found that M.E.B.A. had an agreement with P.M.A. in which the M.E.B.A. would handle all the dispatches for them. The unlawful preferences claimed by Thor and Moehl were that M.E.B.A. would give preference to their own members, applicants to become members, and graduates of their maritime schools in the hiring halls which was seen unfair by non-M.E.B.A. members. In the end the trial examiner, Martin S. Bennett, agreed in favor of MEBA that there had been no unfair labor practices made and that the licensed officers when appointed to supervise by employer and the approval of the union had the authority to discharge an unlicensed worker, therefore the complaints were dismissed.  Union benefits  By becoming a M.E.B.A. member, M.E.B.A. provides a medical plan includes prescription drugs, dental, mental health, disability, life, accidental death, and dismemberment benefits for MEBA members and their dependents by completing what they call a Permanent Data Form. They also offer four kinds of M.E.B.A. Pension Plans. The ‚ÄúRegular Pension Plan‚Äù means members can retire with a regular pension plan if members have twenty years of accredited pension years, regardless of what age they retire. The ‚ÄúReduced Pension Plan‚Äù is for those who have less than twenty accredited pension years and have reached the normal retirement age of sixty-five years old or the fifth anniversary of the start date of the pension plan. The ‚ÄúEarly Retirement Pension‚Äù is for those who choose to retire early when members reach the age of sixty and have a minimum of fifteen accredited pension years. Lastly, there is the ‚ÄúDisability Pension‚Äù in which members can retire early if they have become permanently disabled and have a minimum of ten accredited pension years. There are also ways these pensions can be distributed in situation of marriage, children, and death. M.E.B.A. also provides a 401(k) plan in which members have the option enroll for and if they do they can name a beneficiary. A Vacation Plan is also provided in which is determined by the collective bargaining agreement with the employer, the type of vessel members work on, number of days of Covered Employment, and their rating.

The Latins in the Levant: A History of Frankish Greece (1204‚Äì1566). London: 1908, p.291 Her marriage was politically very crucial and the subject of much diplomatic activity. She was given a proposal from the Vignoso, Genoese Lord of Chios. This marriage was vetoed by the Republic of Venice, who regarded it of the utmost importance that she married a Venetian so as to prevent any potential anti-Venetian establishment in the Duchy. Florence was openly warned by Venice not to bestow her hand to any enemy of Venice, when there were so many Venetian consorts available.Miller, William. The Latins in the Levant: A History of Frankish Greece (1204‚Äì1566). London: 1908. Her mother assured the Venetians that her daughter had not desire to marry an enemy of Venice. Soon, however, Florence was given a proposal by Nerio I Acciajuoli, the future Duke of Athens and showed herself willing to accept it. Venice protested, but the groom was supported by the Kingdom of Naples through Robert of Taranto, who, as Prince of Achaia, was the suzerain of Athens. Naples warned Venice from interfering in the marriage, but Venice replied that Florence was a daughter of the republic and that her duchy owed its existence to the diplomacy and fleet of Venice, and ordered its fleet in Greece to prevent the marriage and the landing of Nerio in the Cyclades.Miller, William. The Latins in the Levant: A History of Frankish Greece (1204‚Äì1566). London: 1908. Duchess Florence was kidnapped and brought via a Venetian galley to Venetian Crete. There, she was treated with respect due to her rank but informed that she would never be allowed to leave unless she agreed to marry the Venetian candidate, her cousin Nicholas Spezzabanda. Reportedly, she was not displeased with the person of Nicholas, who was described as attractive, but whatever the reason, she did consent to marry him, and the wedding took place in 1364. The Venetians entitled her spouse eight Consort Duke, and Nicholas II were described as an able co-regent and loyal to Venice. Florence died in 1371 and was succeeded by her son by Giovanni, Nicholas III dalle Carceri, under the regency of his stepfather during his minority.

Minnie was the daughter of Jewish coal merchant Isaac Glassman and was the first wife (married 1914) of Edgar Lansbury, son of George Lansbury, mayor of Poplar and later leader of the Labour Party. After Minnie's death, Edgar married actress Moyna Macgill and became the father of Angela Lansbury. Minnie Lansbury became a teacher, and joined the East London Federation of Suffragettes in 1915. She was also chair of the War Pensions Committee, fighting for the rights of widows, orphans and wounded from World War I. She was elected alderman on Poplar‚Äôs first Labour council in 1919, after a change in the law allowed some women to receive Parliamentary suffrage and stand as candidates. In 1921, she was one of five women on Poplar Council who, along with their male colleagues including her father-in-law George Lansbury, were jailed for six weeks for refusing to levy full rates in the poverty-stricken area. Due to her imprisonment, she developed pneumonia and died in 1922.

From the appeal the Heritage of London Trust raised over ¬£13,000, which was given to Tower Hamlets Council to complete the restoration.

It was the first racially integrated, intercultural church in the United States. He served as co-pastor with a white minister, Dr. Alfred Fisk. Many of their congregation were African Americans who had migrated to San Francisco from Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas for jobs in the defense industry. The church helped create a new community for many in San Francisco. The Church today The current presiding minister is the Rev. Dorsey Blake. The co-minister is Kathryn Benton. In the recent past, there were other popular associate ministers. The congregation presently consists of a small number of active supporters, many of whom are longtime members. The off-white stucco fa√ßade is embellished by three street-level arched inset doors, and crowned with a leaning belltower. Below the sanctuary at street level is Thurman Hall, named after Dr. Thurman, where meetings, plays, lectures, and music are performed. Neighbors are familiar with the church's use as a polling place, and the leaning bell tower. Neighbors have held meetings at the church, as have other groups. In the 1980s, Fellowship Theater Guild revitalized the church's longtime involvement with the arts. Productions have included \\"I‚Äôm Not Rappaport,\\" \\"LUV\\", \\"Member of the Wedding,\\" and \\"An Evening with Martin and Langston\\" with Danny Glover appearing as Langston Hughes and Felix Justice as Martin Luther King, Jr. In 2005 Justice returned in \\"Jesus Hopped the 'A' Train,\\" and in 2006 local jazz singer Kim Nalley starred as the legendary Billie Holiday in the West Coast premiere of \\"Lady Day in Love.\\" In the summer of 2007, the Church began hosting the Howard Thurman Forum Series of free lectures in its building. Each October at the Church's annual Convocation (open to the public), the Howard Thurman Award honors an exceptional contributor to community and social justice. Past recipients include Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California's 9th District; Rev. Nelson Johnson and Joyce Johnson of Greensboro, NC; and in 2008, Chaplain James Yee, the former US Army Chaplain who served as the Muslim Chaplain for the U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

He studied Ceramics Secondary school in Carlsbad (he left in 1959) and has since done many jobs, mostly manual. In 1961, after publishing his debut poetry book, he quickly established himself as one of the best and most loved writers of his generation. During the 70s and 80s he prepared many radio shows about famous poets of the world (in which he often ‚Äì true to his interest in mystifications ‚Äì wrote many of the poems himself), but his books could not be published officially. After the Velvet revolution he worked in a newspaper. Now he works as an editor in the Current Czech Poetry Library. He is also a renowned translator from German, Dutch, Italian, Latin, French and Russian. His work as an editor is focused mainly on forgotten Czech poets of the last three centuries. Another Czech poet, Ewald Murrer, is his son. Ivan Wernisch lives in Prague.  Works  After his first couple of books, which were rather playful, his poetry began to turn into more dreamy and also absurd one. His poems, full of great imagery based on neologisms, absurd landscapes and mis-quoting other writers, become increasingly sad, if not tragic, with each new book since 1989. His influences include both dadaism and expressionism. His books were published in translations in Germany, Italy, Ukraine, Poland and United States.

The SCAA continuously monitors public debate and the media in order to report on and challenge antisemitic and racist commentary. Its blog, Facebook page, Twitter account and newsletter are sources of information on contemporary antisemitism. SCAA also works through education and advocacy, providing information, expert lecturers and teaching resources for use by teachers, students, the media, political organisations and other interested parties. Since the early 1990s, SCAA has organised regular training courses on antisemitism and other forms of racism, as well as on Nazism and the Holocaust. These courses draw together a number of Sweden‚Äôs leading researchers, experts and educators in the field. SCAA also organises study trips to Poland, Ukraine and the Baltic countries for those looking to deepen their knowledge about the Holocaust. To date, thousands of teachers, youth leaders, politicians, journalists and students have participated in SCAA‚Äôs extensive and nationwide training courses and seminars. Each year, SCAA organizes memorial services to commemorate Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January (the anniversary of Auschwitz‚Äôs liberation) as well as the November Pogroms in Nazi Germany (Kristallnacht) that occurred on 9 November 1938. The ELSA Prize is an annual award that was instituted by SCAA to highlight the efforts of young people who, via social media or other forms of activism, have campaigned against antisemitism and other forms of prejudice. The ELSA Prize consists of a diploma and the sum of 20 000 SEK and is awarded in conjunction with the annual memorial service commemorating the November Pogroms. History The SCAA was formed in 1983 in the wake of the surge of antisemitism that occurred in the early 1980s. During the late 1980s, SCAA disclosed anti-Jewish propaganda spread by the community radio station Radio Islam. SCAA‚Äôs report to Sweden‚Äôs Attorney General resulted in charges being brought against Radio Islam‚Äôs controller, who was later convicted of several counts of inciting race hate. Since 1996, Radio Islam has been spreading hatred of Jews through the internet with almost the same antisemitic message as before, something that SCAA has many times drawn attention to. In the 1990s, Sweden experienced a stark antisemitic surge in connection with the increase in extremist far-right activity. Through advocacy, training and reports, SCAA highlighted the proliferation of Holocaust-denial propaganda and the dissemination of racist white power music. SCAA played an important role in the implementation of the Government‚Äôs Living History information campaign (1997-2003), and today continues to works closely with the governmental Living History Forum. In recent years, antisemitism has become more visible both in Europe and globally; a development that has also left its mark on Sweden. Through its articles, newsletters and training seminars, SCAA continues to highlight and combat anti-Jewish hate crimes and anti-Semitic propaganda.

(1974) Introduction to the Theory of Statistics (3rd Edition). McGraw-Hill. Section 2.2 (available online ) One way of deriving a priori probabilities is the principle of indifference, which has the character of saying that, if there are N mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive events and if they are equally likely, then the probability of a given event occurring is 1/N. Similarly the probability of one of a given collection of K events is K / N. One disadvantage of defining probabilities in the above way is that it applies only to finite collections of events. In Bayesian inference, \\"uninformative priors\\" or \\"objective priors\\" are particular choices of a priori probabilities. E.g. Harold J. Price and Allison R. Manson, \\"Uninformative priors for Bayes‚Äô theorem\\" , AIP Conf. Proc. 617, 2001 Note that \\"prior probability\\" is a broader concept. Similar to the distinction in philosophy between a priori and a posteriori, in Bayesian inference a priori denotes general knowledge about the data distribution before making an inference, while a posteriori denotes knowledge that incorporates the results of making an inference.. A priori probability in statistical mechanics The a priori probability has an important application in statistical mechanics. The classical version is defined as the ratio of the number of elementary events (e.g. the number of times a die is thrown) to the total number of events - and these considered purely deductively, i.e. without any experimenting. In the case of the die if we look at it on the table without throwing it, each elementary event is reasoned deductively to have the same probability ‚Äî thus the probability of each outcome of an imaginary throwing of the (perfect) die or simply by counting the number of faces is 1/6. Each face of the die appears with equal probability ‚Äî probability being a measure defined for each elementary event. The result is different if we throw the die twenty times and ask how many times (out of 20) the number 6 appears on the upper face. In this case time comes into play and we have a different type of probability depending on time or the number of times the die is thrown. On the other hand, the a priori probability is independent of time - you can look at the die on the table as long as you like without touching it and you deduce the probability for the number 6 to appear on the upper face is 1/6. In statistical mechanics, e.g. that of a gas contained in a finite volume V , both the spatial coordinates q_i and the momentum coordinates p_i of the individual gas elements (atoms or molecules) are finite in the phase space spanned by these coordinates. In analogy to the case of the die, the a priori probability is here (in the case of a continuum) proportional to the phase space volume element \\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p divided by h, and is the number of standing waves (i.e. states) therein, where \\\\Delta q is the range of the variable q and \\\\Delta p is the range of the variable p (here for simplicity considered in one dimension). In 1 dimension (length L) this number or statistical weight or a priori weighting is L \\\\Delta p/h . In customary 3 dimensions (volume V) the corresponding number can be calculated to be V 4\\\\pi p^2\\\\Delta p/h^3.H.J.W. M√ºller-Kirsten, Basics of Statistical Physics, 2nd. ed. World Scientific (Singapore, 2013), Chapter 6 In order to understand this quantity as giving a number of states in quantum (i.e. wave) mechanics, recall that in quantum mechanics every particle is associated with a matter wave which is the solution of a Schr√∂dinger equation. In the case of free particles (of energy \\\\epsilon = {\\\\bf p}^2/2m) like those of a gas in a box of volume V = L^3 such a matter wave is explicitly : \\\\psi \\\\propto \\\\sin(l\\\\pi x/L)\\\\sin(m\\\\pi y/L)\\\\sin(n\\\\pi z/L), where l, m, n are integers. The number of different (l,m,n) values and hence states in the region between p, p+dp, p^2 = {\\\\bf p}^2, is then found to be the above expression V4\\\\pi p^2dp/h^3 by considering the area covered by these points. Moreover, in view of the uncertainty relation, which in 1 spatial dimension is :\\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p \\\\geq h , these states are indistinguishable (i.e. these states do not carry labels). An important consequence is a result known as Liouville's theorem, i.e. the time independence of this phase space volume element and thus of the a priori probability. A time dependence of this quantity would imply known information about the dynamics of the system, and hence would not be an a priori probability.A. Ben-Naim, Entropy Demystified, World Scientific (Singapore, 2007) Thus the region : \\\\Omega:=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p}{\\\\int \\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\int \\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p = const., when differentiated with respect to time t yields zero (with the help of Hamilton's equations): The volume at time t is the same as at time zero. One describes this also as conservation of information. In the full quantum theory one has an analogous conservation law. In this case, the phase space region is replaced by a subspace of the space of states expressed in terms of a projection operator P, and instead of the probability in phase space, one has the probability density : \\\\Sigma: = \\\\frac{P}{Tr P},\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; N = Tr P = const., where N is the dimensionality of the subspace. The conservation law in this case is expressed by the unitarity of the S-matrix. In either case, the considerations assume a closed isolated system. This closed isolated system is a system with (1) a fixed energy E and (2) a fixed number of particles N in (c) a state of equilibrium. If one considers a huge number of replicas of this system, one obtains what is called a \`\`microcanonical ensemble¬¥¬¥. It is for this system that one postulates in quantum statistics the \`\`fundamental postulate of equal a priori probabilities of an isolated system¬¥¬¥. This says that the isolated system in equilibrium occupies each of its accessible states with the same probability. This fundamental postulate therefore allows us to equate the a priori probability to the degeneracy of a system, i.e. to the number of different states with the same energy. Example The following example illustrates the a priori probability (or a priori weighting) in (a) classical and (b) quantal contexts. (a) Classical a priori probability Consider the rotational energy E of a diatomic molecule with moment of inertia I in spherical polar coordinates \\\\theta, \\\\phi (this means q above is here \\\\theta, \\\\phi), i.e. : E = \\\\frac{1}{2I}\\\\left(p^2_{\\\\theta} + \\\\frac{p^2_{\\\\phi}}{\\\\sin^2\\\\theta}\\\\right). The (p_{\\\\theta}, p_{\\\\phi})-curve for constant E and \\\\theta is an ellipse of area :\\\\oint dp_{\\\\theta}dp_{\\\\phi} = \\\\pi \\\\sqrt{2IE}\\\\sqrt{2IE}\\\\sin\\\\theta = 2\\\\pi IE\\\\sin\\\\theta . By integrating over \\\\theta and \\\\phi the total volume of phase space covered for constant energy E is :\\\\int^{\\\\phi=2\\\\pi}_{0}\\\\int^{\\\\theta=\\\\pi}_0 2I\\\\pi E\\\\sin\\\\theta d\\\\theta d\\\\phi = 8\\\\pi^2 IE = \\\\oint dp_{\\\\theta}dp_{\\\\phi}d\\\\theta d\\\\phi, and hence the classical a priori weighting in the energy range dE is :\\\\Omega \\\\propto (phase space volume at E+dE) minus (phase space volume at E) is given by 8{\\\\pi}^2 I dE. (b) Quantum a priori probability Assuming that the number of quantum states in a range \\\\Delta q \\\\Delta p for each direction of motion is given, per element, by a factor \\\\Delta q\\\\Delta p/h, the number of states in the energy range dE is, as seen under (a) 8\\\\pi^2I dE/h^2 for the rotating diatomic molecule. From wave mechanics it is known that the energy levels of a rotating diatomic molecule are given by : E_n = \\\\frac{n(n+1)h^2}{8\\\\pi^2 I}, each such level being (2n+1)-fold degenerate. By evaluating dn/dE_n=1/(dE_n/dn) one obtains :\\\\frac{dn}{dE_n} = \\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2 I}{(2n+1)h^2}, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\; (2n+1)dn=\\\\frac{8\\\\pi^2 I}{h^2}dE_n. Thus by comparison with \\\\Omega above, one finds that the approximate number of states in the range dE is given by the degeneracy, i.e. : \\\\Sigma \\\\propto (2n+1)dn. Thus the a priori weighting in the classical context (a) corresponds to the a priori weighting here in the quantal context (b). In the case of the one-dimensional simple harmonic oscillator of natural frequency u one finds correspondingly: (a) \\\\Omega \\\\propto dE/ u , and (b) \\\\Sigma \\\\propto dn (no degeneracy). Thus in quantum mechanics the a priori probability is effectively a measure of the degeneracy, i.e. the number of states having the same energy. In the case of the hydrogen atom or Coulomb potential (where the evaluation of the phase space volume for constant energy is more complicated) one knows that the quantum mechanical degeneracy is n^2 with E\\\\propto 1/n^2 . Thus in this case \\\\Sigma \\\\propto n^2 dn . A priori probability and distribution functions In statistical mechanics (see any book) one derives the so-called distribution functions f for various statistics. In the case of Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics and Bose‚ÄìEinstein statistics these functions are respectively : f^{FD}_i = \\\\frac{1}{e^{(\\\\epsilon_i - \\\\epsilon_0)/kT}+1}, \\\\quad f^{BE}_i = \\\\frac{1}{e^{(\\\\epsilon_i-\\\\epsilon_0)/kT}-1}. These functions are derived for (1) a system in dynamic equilibrium (i.e. under steady, uniform conditions) with (2) total (and huge) number of particles N = \\\\Sigma_in_i (this condition determines the constant \\\\epsilon_0), and (3) total energy E = \\\\Sigma_in_i\\\\epsilon_i, i.e. with each of the n_i particles having the energy \\\\epsilon_i. An important aspect in the derivation is the taking into account of the indistinguishability of particles and states in quantum statistics, i.e. there particles and states do not have labels. In the case of fermions, like electrons, obeying the Pauli principle (only one particle per state or none allowed), one has therefore : 0 \\\\leq f^{FD}_i \\\\leq 1, \\\\quad whereas \\\\quad 0 \\\\leq f^{BE}_i \\\\leq \\\\infty. Thus f^{FD}_i is a measure of the fraction of states actually occupied by electrons at energy \\\\epsilon_i and temperature T. On the other hand, the a priori probability g_i is a measure of the number of wave mechanical states available. Hence : n_i = f_ig_i. Since n_i is constant under uniform conditions (as many particles as flow out of a volume element also flow in steadily, so that the situation in the element appears static), i.e. independent of time t, and g_i is also independent of time t as shown earlier, we obtain : \\\\frac{df_i}{dt} = 0, \\\\quad f_i = f_i(t, {\\\\bf v}_i, {\\\\bf r}_i). Expressing this equation in terms of its partial derivatives, one obtains the Boltzmann transport equation. How do coordinates {\\\\bf r} etc. appear here suddenly? Above no mention was made of electric or other fields. Thus with no such fields present we have the Fermi-Dirac distribution as above. But with such fields present we have this additional dependence of f.

Biography Levi was born to poor immigrant parents who could not afford to educate him. He worked as a shoemaker, then as a hatter, then as a printer. He read voraciously in Jewish literature from ancient times to the present, as well as in Christian writings about Judaism and about the Bible. Self-educated, he realised how little both Jews and Christians in England knew about Judaism and resolved to explain and defend his faith. His first published work, A Succinct Account of the Rites and Ceremonies of the Jews (1782), tried to explain Judaism to Jews and to correct Christian misconceptions about Judaism. Next, he translated the prayer books of both the Ashkenazi and Spanish and Portuguese Jews. He supervised a translation of the Old Testament into English and published a Hebrew grammar and dictionary, and a guide to the Hebrew language. In 1786, Joseph Priestley published his Letter to the Jews (1786), urging them to convert. Levi published a lengthy answer, which led to many arguments with Christian divines. This led to his three-volume Dissertation on the Prophecies of the Old Testament (1793‚Äì1800), which he printed and published himself. It was republished in London in 1817 in two volumes. Levi's work was well known in Christian circles; his Dissertation on the Prophecies was accepted as authoritative by many scholars, both Jewish and Christian, well into the nineteenth century. His six-volume English translation of the liturgy served as the foundation for later editions published in England and in the United States. His Protestant friend Henry Lemoine published an obituary in the Gentleman's Magazine (October 1801), \\"He's Gone! the Pride of Israel's Busy Tribe\\". It praised him as a great explainer and defender of Judaism against both Christians and sceptics. Levi was also poet in ordinary to the synagogue, and furnished odes when required on several public celebrations, as, for instance, on the king's escape from assassination in 1795.

Historically, the business operated at the Ocean View Amusement Park. At that location Abe Doumar, the business' creator, is credited with creating the world's first ice cream cone. Restaurant Doumar is said to have created the first ice cream cone in 1904 at the St. Louis Exposition. In 1913, Doumar opened a vending location on the boardwalk of the Virginia Beach Oceanfront in that popular resort city. Later, he opened another restaurant at Ocean View Amusement Park. After a hurricane destroyed the stands in 1933, Abe's brother George opened the new restaurant at its location on Monticello Avenue in 1934.The Ocean View Nickel Tour - Part VII Doumar's Cones and BBQ is known for its barbecue, ice cream and curb service with carhop waitresses who take orders at customer cars. Doumar's Cones and BBQ never offered curb service on skates. Although a curb once separated the restaurant and the service parking area, it has since been paved over. Doumar's Cones and BBQ is usually confused with a similar nearby drive-in, called Schoes, which went out of business. Their curb service girls wore skates and hot pants. The Doumar Family Abe Doumar was born in Syria in 1881 and moved to the U.S. around 1895. He brought his mother, father and three brothers (Charlie, George, and John) to the United States prior to his death in 1947.Doumar's Cones & Barbecue _ Norfolk, Virginia George Doumar, born in 1892, re-built Doumar's and worked at the restaurant until he died in 1974. His son, Albert Doumar, born in 1922 in Norfolk, worked at the restaurant until August 2013, making daily ice cream cones with a cone making machine that dates from 1905. Albert Doumar died after battling bladder cancer on May 14, 2014. A son of George Doumar, Robert G. Doumar, is a federal judge. In May 1999, the restaurant was awarded a James Beard Foundation Award in the \\"America's Classics\\" category which honors legendary family-owned restaurants around the country. In July 2002, they received the Gourmet Magazine Award for the best ice cream cones in the US.The Company In August 2008, the restaurant was featured on Food Network's hit series Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. In 2011, director Spike Lee used Doumar's for a series of promos for the Ed Schultz show as part of MSNBC's \\"Lean Forward\\" campaign. In one episode, Schultz is seen sitting at Doumar's lunch counter when he delivers the line \\"I need two shows.\\" Ice cream cone Legend holds that Abe, at 16, began to sell paperweights and other items while dressed in Arab robes. One night, he bought a waffle from another vendor. Leonidas Kestekid√®s was a fellow Greek Ottoman who came from Ghent in Belgium with the Fritz waffle machine invented by his cousin Georges Krieger-Zacharid√®s (Fritz) in 1855 in Brussels. Abe rolled the waffle up and placed a scoop of ice cream on top. He then began selling the cones at the St. Louis Exposition. His cones were such a success that he designed a four-iron baking machine and had a foundry make it for him. At the Jamestown Exposition in 1907, his outlet sold nearly twenty-three thousand cones. After that, Abe bought a semiautomatic 36-iron machine which produced 20 cones per minute.The Ocean View Nickel Tour - Part VII References Category:Restaurants in Virginia Category:Companies based in Norfolk, Virginia Category:Buildings and structures in Norfolk, Virginia Category:Restaurants established in 1934 Category:1934 establishments in Virginia Category:James Beard Foundation Award winners ","title":"Doumar's Cones and BBQ"},{"id":"10782803","text":"Richard Alexander (November 19, 1902 ‚Äì August 9, 1989) was an American film character actor.

It is a cast-iron arch bridge spanning and 24 feet (7.3m) wide, designed by Thomas Telford and completed in April 1826. It is a Grade II* listed structure. Telford was appointed to design the bridge in 1823, following a dispute between the bridge trustees and their existing architect, who had proposed a bridge with three shorter iron arches. Telford changed the scheme to a single span so as to reduce interference with navigation of the river, and also to eliminate the expense of constructing foundations in the river gravels. Like Telford's Craigellachie Bridge, Mythe Bridge was cast by William Hazledine, and is similar in form to Telford's Galton Bridge, which spans the Birmingham Canal at Smethwick. It has six cast iron ribs, each cast in 23-foot (7m) lengths, with spandrels filled with X-shaped bracing. Telford described the iron as \\"best Shropshire iron, commonly called No. 2\\"'. The arch rises 17 feet (5.2m), one tenth of the span. The X-bracing carries the diagonal crossed bracing to the spandrels beneath the beam, as well as to the carriageway and balustrade. The abutments at either end of the bridge houses a group of six tunnel vaults with pointed arches and stone quoins. These are separated by the attached colonnettes. Hugh McIntosh was contractor for the embankment and abutments. The total cost of the bridge including masonry approaches was ¬£14,500, It was originally a toll bridge, but tolls were removed in 1850. An Ordnance Survey map of 1884 shows a toll booth at either end of the bridge. Telford wrote: > I reckon this the most handsomest bridge which has been built under my > direction ... The bridge was designated a Grade II* listed building on 4 March 1952, the reason for listing it being that it is of \\"technological interest as a bridge of iron construction with a 52m span designed in the early 1820s, part of the first generation of this technologically significant type of bridge\\" and because of its \\"engineering interest as a significant bridge built by Thomas Telford.\\" Historic England has placed the bridge on the Heritage at Risk register. In 1923, the decking was strengthened by adding a reinforced concrete slab. In 1990, tests showed the bridge was too weak for many heavy goods vehicles, and traffic was limited to a 7.5 ton maximum. This was increased to 17 tons after the bridge had been strengthened in 1992. The secondary members needed strengthening and this was effected by enhancing the shear strength of the transverse cross beams by bonding steel plates to the web of the cross beams. The longitudinal cross-bracing was strengthened by using angle splints and the space between the splints and the cross-bracing was grouted. Additional transverse bracing was supplied by reinforcing the central spine of the arch, with one end bolted to steel sleeves, and the other end bolted to the cross beams at the top of the arch.

It is the most visited museum in North Germany. In addition to the main museum building, the actual Oceanographic Museum, there are three other sites, the Ozeaneum, opened in July 2008, the Nautineum and the Natureum. The main house is located in the hall of the former St. Catherine's Church. The Oceanographic Museum has many exhibitions with information on fishing, the environment and marine conservation, on marine and ocean research, flora and fauna of the Baltic Sea region, and, just under 50 aquaria contain more than 600 living sea creatures, including giant tortoises and Polynesian fish. In the Ozeaneum, which opened on 11 July 2008 on Stralsund's harbour island, there are 39 large aquaria with 7,000 animals from the Baltic Sea, North Sea and Atlantic Ocean, as well as the world's largest exhibition of whales. The Nautineum on the island of D√§nholm has exhibitions on the topics of fishing, marine research, whale research, hydrography and sea routes. The focal point of the Natureum on the Dar√ü peninsula is nature and the landscape of the peninsula.  History  The museum was founded in 1951 as the Natural History Museum, by Prof. Otto Dibbelt. Starting in 1956 under the leadership of Dr. Sonnfried Streicher, it was continuously development. It current director is Dr. Harald Benke. After an extension of the exhibition theme to oceanography, in 1966 the museum was renamed the Oceanographic Museum and, in 1974, it was renamed the Museum of Oceanography and Fisheries of the GDR. Between 1989 and 1990, the construction of the museum caf√© and museum shop was undertaken and the expansion of the aquarium wing started in 1988 completed. The permanent exhibition, \\"Man and the Sea\\", was continued and public relations enhanced. The museum participated in the construction of the Western Pomerania Lagoon Area National Park with an exhibition centre in the lighthouse complex of Dar√üer Ort, later Natureum Dar√üer Ort. The whale exhibition was redesigned. On the island of Oie the DMM station has been expanded. A quarantine facility for tropical marine life and a filter system for the cold water area were completed as well as a 6,000-litre aquarium with live coral and other marine invertebrates. In 1991, the museum caf√© and shop were opened and the expansion of the collections reaches more than 800 objects. The extension wing was completed in 1992. In the same year an aquarium for tropical marine fish was handed over. The museum building was opened in honour of Hermann Burmeister. In 1994, the hitherto town-owned museum was turned into a foundation under civil law. In 1996, the vessel \\"Adolf Reichwein\\" was restored in the museum courtyard. Also restored were the Baltic Sea walking tour the museum shop. The North Sea Aquarium was closed to begin the renovation of that department.

A branch collar is the often visible swelling in a woody plant that forms at the base of a branch where it is attached to its parent branch or to the tree's trunk. The top of the branch collar consists of dense interlocking wood grain,Slater, D. Bradley, R, Withers, P. and Ennos, A. R. (2014) The anatomy and grain pattern in forks of hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and other tree species, Trees 28 (5) 1437-1448 which provides mechanical support to the branch attachment. Branch collars can also be flat or somewhat recessed into the trunk or parent branch, as in some conifers. The collar consists primarily of tissues connected directly to the tree's main trunk or stem, not to the branch. As a lateral branch typically grows more slowly in diameter than the upright stem to which it is attached, the base of the smaller branch becomes occluded, eventually forming a knot. It is this process of occlusion that gives rise to the swollen branch collar visible on many branch attachments. When woody plants naturally shed branches because those branches are nonproductive, usually from lack of light reaching them, these lower branches typically die back to the branch collar. Insects and fungi decompose the dead branch, and it eventually falls off, leaving the exposed end of the branch at the point of its attachment at the branch collar. This arrangement helps to resist the spread of decay organisms into the parent stem or trunk during the time it takes for the increment growth of the trunk to seal over the dead branch stub. Events such as storms or pruning may damage the branch collar, thus reducing the naturally occurring defenses of a branch attachment and exposing the trunk tissues adjacent to the wound to disease or decay. Understanding the external appearance and anatomical importance of a branch collar is key to correct tree pruning. Pruning practices that mimic natural branch shedding avoid unnecessary damage to the plant's defensive anatomy.Tree pruning guide prepared by the US Forest Service for the US Department of Agriculture features a diagram of the branch collar.

The solution is the orthic triangle, with vertices at the base points of the altitudes of the given triangle. Solution The orthic triangle, with vertices at the base points of the altitudes of the given triangle, has the smallest perimeter of all triangles inscribed into an acute triangle, hence it is the solution of Fagnano's problem. Fagnano's original proof used calculus methods and an intermediate result given by his father Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano. Later however several geometric proofs were discovered as well, amongst others by Hermann Schwarz and Lip√≥t Fej√©r. These proofs use the geometrical properties of reflections to determine some minimal path representing the perimeter. Physical principles A solution from physics is found by imagining putting a rubber band that follows Hooke's Law around the three sides of a triangular frame ABC, such that it could slide around smoothly. Then the rubber band would end up in a position that minimizes its elastic energy, and therefore minimize its total length. This position gives the minimal perimeter triangle. The tension inside the rubber band is the same everywhere in the rubber band, so in its resting position, we have, by Lami's theorem, \\\\angle bcA = \\\\angle acB, \\\\angle caB = \\\\angle baC, \\\\angle abC = \\\\angle cbA Triangle abc is the orthic triangle of triangle ABC Therefore, this minimal triangle is the orthic triangle.

Biography =Youth= Emrys Jones was born in 1920, to Samuel and Anne Jones, in Aberdare, Monmouth, Wales, on the rim of the South Wales coalfield, when the coal and iron industries were about to begin their long decline. He was educated at the Aberdare county school for boys. =Marriage & Tertiary Studies= He married Iona, from Anglesey, and in 1938 went to University College, Aberystwyth, now Aberystwyth University, but then a small college of about 700 students at the forefront of the British development of geography. Reading geography and anthropology, he took a particular interest in the geography of cities. As a pacifist, he became a conscientious objector in the Second World War, serving as an orderly in a cancer hospital and working as an ambulance driver. After the war he completed an MSc (1945) and PhD (1947) at Aberystwyth. He was appointed to an assistant lectureship at University College London (1947‚Äì50), followed by a lectureship and time as a senior lecturer at Queen's University, Belfast (1950‚Äì58). In 1959, he became reader in social geography at London School of Economics (LSE), and a professor (1961‚Äì84). =London School of Economics= While at LSE he formed a productive relationship with Professor Michael Wise. He published his Social Geography of Belfast in 1960, and his studies of \\"the spatial component of human behaviour\\" resulted in his edited Readings in Social Geography of 1975. He published an Atlas of London with D.J. Sinclair, producing his first maps in 1968. Other works included Human Geography (1964), Towns and Cities (1966), Man and his Habitat (1971), The Future of Planning (with Evan Zandt, 1973) and Introduction to Social Geography (with J. Eyles, 1977), as well as many journal articles. He became an international consultant in town and regional planning schemes, was involved in the work of the Council for National Academic Awards, and advised polytechnics which were introducing degree courses. =Honours= Jones was honoured with the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society, of which he was a vice president. He was also awarded an honorary fellowship of the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, and received honorary degrees from Queen's University, Belfast, and the Open University in 1990. In 2003 he was elected a senior fellow of the British Academy. =Retirement= Jones continued to write throughout his retirement, producing Metropolis in 1990. Passionate about his Welsh identity since his youth, Jones gave more time to Wales in his retirement. He served as chairman (1983‚Äì89) and then president of the council of the Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion (1989-2002), and edited and wrote the greater part of The Welsh in London in 2001. He was received into the Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod in 2005. =Death= Jones died in 2006, aged 86, survived by his wife Iona and daughter Catrin. Another daughter, Rhianon, predeceased him. References * Elliot, John. Emrys Jones: A founding spirit of social geography. The Guardian. 15 September 2006.

From the southern terminus, the road passes several homes before leaving Selbyville. At this point, DE 17 enters a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. Here, the name of road becomes Roxana Road. Upon reaching the community of Roxana, the roadway crosses DE 20\\\\. After DE 20, the road continues through rural areas. Following a turn to the north, the route comes to its terminus at an intersection with DE 26 to the west of the town of Millville. In 2016, DE 17 had an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 4,571 vehicles at the northern terminus at DE 26 to a low of 3,124 vehicles at the northern border of Selbyville. None of DE 17 is part of the National Highway System. The portion of DE 17 between Daisey Road and Peppers Corner Road serves as part of a hurricane evacuation route from the coastal town of South Bethany, providing an alternate to DE 26 to the north. History By 1920, what is now DE 17 was under construction as an unnumbered paved state highway between Selbyville and Roxana, with a small section of paved state highway complete near Roxana. It was also designated as a state aid road, a road that was to receive funding from the state to be built as a state highway by the county, from Roxana north to Millville. All of the route had been completed as an unnumbered paved state highway by 1924. DE 17 was designated by 1938 to run from DE 54 in Selbyville to DE 26 near Millville. The route has remained on the same alignment since.

It contains a pair of combat boots to represent every American soldier and marine that has died in the war, as well as shoes representing Iraqi civilians who have lost their lives during the invasion and occupation. The exhibit was first shown in Chicago's Federal Plaza in January 2004. At that time, the exhibit contained 504 pairs of boots. As of March 2007, the national exhibit contained over 3,400 pairs of boots and had visited more than 100 cities in 40 states. However, as a result of its unmanageable size, the exhibit has been broken down state-by-state. Currently, nearly every state has its own state exhibit. The national exhibit in its entirety would currently contain more than 4,000 pairs of empty boots. Background According to the American Friends Service Committee, the intent of the exhibit is to present a visual reminder of the \\"human cost\\" of the Iraq War and provide a place for public mourning. Based on public information, the American Friends Service Committee writes the name, age, rank and home state of each soldier and attaches it to a representative pair of boots. As the exhibit travels across the country, family members, friends and sympathizers leave flags, flowers and other mementos with individual pairs of boots. If a family wishes to have their child's name removed from the exhibit, AFSC will replace the serviceman's name with the information \\"name removed request of family\\". September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows co-sponsors the exhibit. In addition to boots representing the deaths of service men and women, AFSC has collected shoes representing Iraqis who have lost their lives during occupation. Few names of Iraqi dead are known. Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi social activist, has collected the names of several thousand Iraqi civilians. These are the names that appear on tags of civilian shoes at Eyes Wide Open exhibits and for another exhibit entitled, \\"Dreams and Nightmares\\". AFSC‚Äôs Dreams and Nightmares is a memorial to Iraqi civilians that includes photographs and stories of individuals who have lost their lives during occupation. Related exhibits Since the inauguration of the original exhibit, several other exhibits have been created to assist in the original one's goal. =Eyes Wide Open State Exhibits = The national exhibit had grown so large by spring of 2007 that it had become difficult to transport by semi-truck. As a result, it has been divided into state exhibits. Illinois established the first state exhibit in August 2006. As of July 2008, there are 48 state exhibits: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, two in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine/Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri/Kansas, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York/New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. With the conclusion of the national exhibit, all but six states currently have their own exhibit. All of the Eyes Wide Open state exhibits continue to be under the leadership of The American Friends Service Committee. =The National Guard Exhibit = The National Guard Exhibit was created in summer of 2005 and contains 400+ pairs of boots for National Guard soldiers that have lost their lives in Iraq. The exhibit often also displays the boots of all soldiers lost from the exhibition state. In addition, the exhibit contains 50 pairs of civilian shoes representing the Iraqi civilians killed during occupation. The exhibit has visited more than 30 cities in 22 states. National Guard units are not often sent abroad. =Cost of War Exhibit = At the conclusion of the National Eyes Wide Open Exhibit in June 2007, AFSC introduced the Cost of War Exhibit. The Exhibit contains ten 7 by 3 foot vinyl, full-color banners that compare the U.S. budget for the War in Iraq to the U.S. budget for human needs such as health care and education. Based on a report by economists Joseph Stiglitz and Linda Bilmes, one day of the Iraq War costs the U.S. $720 million or $500,000 per minute. In partnership with The National Priorities Project, AFSC has used these numbers on the daily cost of the Iraq War to determine how many human services one day of the Iraq War budget could cover. For example, \\"one day of the Iraq War\\" would buy 1,153,846 children school lunches for a year or provide 163,525 adults with full health coverage for one year. This exhibit is either shown alone or in conjunction with Eyes Wide Open Exhibits. There are currently 17 Cost of War Exhibits. =Addition of a veteran suicide component = Alarming studies of the suicide rate among veterans returning from the Iraq War led to the addition of a Veteran Suicide component to several state exhibits. Veteran suicides are considered a \\"hidden casualty count\\" of the Iraq War and are represented by white combat boots. Exhibit in popular media The exhibit was featured in blues musician Robert Cray‚Äôs music video for \\"Twenty\\". The song \\"Twenty\\" tells the story of a fictional serviceman who returns to The U.S. haunted by his experience in Iraq. The video stars an actual Iraq War veteran, 23-year-old Aidan Delgado. Cray did not know of the Eyes Wide Open exhibit when he came up with the concept for the song, but realized that the exhibit would be a meaningful way for the character in his song to come to terms with the death he faced in Iraq. Robert Cray‚Äôs album, also titled \\"Twenty\\" was nominated for a Grammy as Best Contemporary Blues Album of 2006.

Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists 49:1512-1516. Geology Naturita Formation exposed in a roadcut in eastern Utah. A coal seam is visible below its sandstone bed, with a thin volcanic ash (white) layer in its upper portion. The formation overlies the Cedar Mountain Formation, and underlies the Mancos Shale formation, thus occupying the position of sedimentary strata that have historically been called the Dakota Formation. That term is no longer used for Cretaceous strata that were deposited on the western side of the Cretaceous Seaway.Witzke, B.J., and Ludvigson, G.A. 1994.

In most areas, the Naturita Formation is composed of a lower unit of conglomeratic sandstone, a middle part of lignitic mudstones and coal, and fine- to medium-grained sandstones in the upper part. The Naturita is not uniform in thickness and in many places is very thin or missing so that the Mancos Formation is in direct contact with the Cedar Mountain Formation. Where missing, a lag of conglomerate may be present to indicate winnowing of sediments, which occurred by advancing Cretaceous seas. In other places, deposition of Naturita sediments did not occur, and these areas may have been quiet lagoons. Coastal coal swamps also formed in low areas as the encroaching sea raised the base level of rivers and the water table. =Fossils= Fossils from the Naturita include dinosaur bone fragments of ceratopsians, a possible primitive tyrannosaurid, nodosaurid ankylosaurs, a brachiosaurid sauropod, and the bothremyid turtle Paiutemys.Carpenter, K. 2006.

The common dandelion is well known for its yellow flower heads that turn into round balls of silver tufted fruits that disperse in the wind. These balls are usually called \\"clocks\\" in both British and American English. The name \\"blowball\\" has also been used. It grows in temperate regions of the world, in lawns, on roadsides, on disturbed banks and shores of waterways, and other areas with moist soils. T. officinale is considered a weed, especially in lawns and along roadsides, but it is sometimes used as a medical herb and in food preparation. Description Taraxacum officinale grows from generally unbranched taproots and produces one to more than ten stems that are typically tall, but sometimes up to tall. The stems can be tinted purplish, they are upright or lax, and produce flower heads that are held as tall or taller than the foliage. The foliage may be upright-growing or horizontally spreading; the leaves have petioles that are either unwinged or narrowly winged. The stems can be glabrous or sparsely covered with short hairs. Plants have milky latex and the leaves are all basal; each flowering stem lacks bracts and has one single flower head. The yellow flower heads lack receptacle bracts and all the flowers, which are called florets, are ligulate and bisexual. In many lineages, fruits are mostly produced by apomixis, notwithstanding the flowers are visited by many types of insects. The leaves are long and wide, and are oblanceolate, oblong, or obovate in shape, with the bases gradually narrowing to the petiole. The leaf margins are typically shallowly lobed to deeply lobed and often lacerate or toothed with sharp or dull teeth. The calyculi (the cuplike bracts that hold the florets) are composed of 12 to 18 segments: each segment is reflexed and sometimes glaucous. The lanceolate shaped bractlets are in two series, with the apices acuminate in shape. The wide involucres are green to dark green or brownish-green, with the tips dark gray or purplish. The florets number 40 to over 100 per head, having corollas that are yellow or orange-yellow in color. The fruits, called cypselae, range in color from olive-green or olive-brown to straw-colored to grayish, they are oblanceoloid in shape and long with slender beaks. The fruits have 4 to 12 ribs that have sharp edges. The silky pappi, which form the parachutes, are white to silver- white in color and around 6 mm wide. Plants typically have 24 or 40 pairs of chromosomes, while some have 16 or 32 pairs. Taxonomy =North American dandelions= The taxonomy of the genus Taraxacum is complicated by apomictic and polyploid lineages, and the taxonomy and nomenclatural situation of Taraxacum officinale is not yet fully resolved. The taxonomy of this genus has been complicated by the recognition of numerous species, subspecies and microspecies. For example, Rothmaler's flora of Germany recognizes roughly 70 microspecies. The plants introduced to North America are triploids that reproduce by obligate gametophytic apomixis Some authorities recognize three subspecies of Taraxacum officinale including: * Taraxacum officinale ssp. ceratophorum (Ledeb.) Schinz ex Thellung which is commonly called common dandelion, fleshy dandelion, horned dandelion or rough dandelion. It is native to Canada and the western US. Some sources list it as a species, Taraxacum ceratophorum. * Taraxacum officinale ssp. officinale, which is commonly called common dandelion or wandering dandelion. * Taraxacum officinale ssp. vulgare (Lam.) Schinz & R. Keller, which is commonly called common dandelion. Two of them have been introduced and established in Alaska and the third (ssp. ceratophorum) is native there. =European dandelions= Taraxacum officinale L. (dandelion) is a vigorous weed in Europe with diploid sexual populations in the southern regions and partially overlapping populations of diploid sexuals and triploid or tetraploid apomicts in the central and northern regions. Dandelion in To≈°ko ƒåelo, Slovenia These European dandelions can be divided into two groups. The first group reproduces sexually, as do most seed plants. This group consists of dandelions that have a diploid set of chromosomes, and are sexually self-incompatible. Sexual reproduction involves a reduction of the somatic chromosome number by meiosis followed by a restoration of the somatic chromosome number by fertilization. Diploid dandelions have eight pairs of chromosomes, and meiosis is regular with normal pairing of homologous chromosomes at the metaphase I stage of meiosis. The second group consists of polyploid (mostly triploid) apomicts, meaning that both a viable embryo as well as a functional endosperm is formed without prior fertilization. In contrast to the sexual diploids, the pairing of chromosomes at metaphase I in triploid apomicts is strongly reduced. However pairing is still sufficient to allow some recombination between homologous chromosomes. Taraxacum officinale has many English common names (some of which are no longer in use), including blowball, lion's-tooth, cankerwort, milk-witch, yellow-gowan, Irish daisy, monks-head, priest's-crown and puff-ball; other common names include, faceclock, pee-a-bed, wet-a-bed, swine's snout, white endive, and wild endive. Carl Linnaeus named the species Leontodon taraxacum in 1753. The current genus name Taraxacum derives possibly from the Arabic Tharakhchakon, or from the Greek Tarraxos. The common name dandelion comes from the French dent de lion, or \\"lion's tooth\\", in reference to the plant's jagged-edged leaves. Ecology Taraxacum officinale is native to Europe and Asia, and was originally imported to America as a food crop. It is now naturalized throughout North America, southern Africa, South America, New Zealand, Australia, and India. It occurs in all 50 states of the US and most Canadian provinces. It is considered a noxious weed in some jurisdictions, and is considered to be a nuisance in residential and recreational lawns in North America. It is also an important weed in agriculture and causes significant economic damage because of its infestation in many crops worldwide. T. officinale can serve as an indicator plant for soil potassium and calcium, as the plant favours soils deficient in the latter but rich in the former. Weiler, Austria The dandelion is a common colonizer of disturbed habitats, both from wind blown seeds and seed germination from the seed bank. The seeds remain viable in the seed bank for many years, with one study showing germination after nine years. This species is a somewhat prolific seed producer, with 54 to 172 seeds produced per head, and a single plant can produce more than 5,000 seeds a year. It is estimated that more than 97,000,000 seeds/hectare could be produced yearly by a dense stand of dandelions. When released, the seeds can be spread by the wind up to several hundred meters from their source. The seeds are also a common contaminant in crop and forage seeds. The plants are adaptable to most soils and the seeds are not dependent on cold temperatures before they will germinate but they need to be within the top of soil. T. officinale is food for the caterpillars of several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), such as the tortrix moth Celypha rufana. See also List of Lepidoptera that feed on dandelions. Even though dandelion pollen is of poor nutritional quality for honey bees, they readily consume it, and it can be an important source of nutritional diversity in heavily managed monocultures such as that of blueberries. Honey bees have not been shown to lower their pollination activity on nearby fruit crops when foraging on dandelions. While not in bloom, this species is sometimes confused with others, such as Chondrilla juncea, that have similar basal rosettes of foliage. Another plant, sometimes referred to as fall dandelion, is very similar to dandelion, but produces \\"yellow fields\\" later. Its blooms resemble some of the species of Sonchus, but are larger.Sonchus North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox Fossil record T. officinale has a fossil record that goes back to glacial and interglacial times in Europe. Uses While the dandelion is considered a weed by most gardeners and especially lawn owners, the plant has several culinary uses. The specific name officinalis refers to its value as a medicinal herb, and is derived from the word opificina, later officina, meaning a workshop or pharmacy. The flowers are used to make dandelion wine, the greens are used in salads, the roots have been used to make a coffee substitute (when baked and ground into powder) and the plant was used by Native Americans as a food and medicine. =Culinary= Plate of sauteed dandelion greens, with Wehani rice Dandelions are harvested from the wild or grown on a small scale as a leaf vegetable. The leaves (called dandelion greens) can be eaten cooked or raw in various forms, such as in soup or salad. They are probably closest in character to mustard greens. Usually the young leaves and unopened buds are eaten raw in salads, while older leaves are cooked. Raw leaves have a slightly bitter taste. Dandelion salad is often accompanied with hard-boiled eggs. The leaves are high in beta- carotene, vitamin C and iron. Dandelion flowers can be used to make dandelion wine, for which there are many recipes. Most of these are more accurately described as \\"dandelion-flavored wine,\\" as some other sort of fermented juice or extract serves as the main ingredient.Gibbons, E. Stalking the Wild Asparagus. David McKay, New York. 1962. It has also been used in a saison ale called Pissenlit (the French word for dandelion, literally meaning \\"wet the bed\\") made by Brasserie Fant√¥me in Belgium. Dandelion and burdock is a soft drink that has long been popular in the United Kingdom. Another recipe using the plant is dandelion flower jam. In Silesia and other parts of Poland and the world, dandelion flowers are used to make a honey substitute syrup with added lemon (so-called May-honey). Ground roasted dandelion root can be used as a non-caffeinated coffee substitute. = Diuretic = T. officinale's diuretic properties have been well described, with the leaves of this plant having been used for this purpose in traditional Chinese medicine for approximately 2,000 years, with other regions of the world using the plant in the same way; in French, a common name for T. officinale is pissenlit, 'a colorful description of its diuretic activity.' A study conducted in 2009 noted 'promising' results regarding these diuretic properties, but that further studies would need to be conducted into the plant's efficacy. =Herbal medicine= Dandelion has been used in traditional medicine in Europe, North America, and China. =Other= Yellow dye colors can be obtained from the flowers but little color can be obtained from the roots of the plant. Etymology Taraxacum is derived from the Arabic word (or ) for a bitter herb.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). pp 279, 371 It may be related to the Greek word œÑŒ±œÅŒ±œÉœÉœâ (tarasso) meaning to disturb. The Latin specific epithet officinale refers to the Latin word for 'medicinal' or 'of the apothecaries'. Taraxalisin Taraxalisin is a serine proteinase found in the latex of dandelion roots. Rudenskaya et al. (1998) found that taraxalisin hydrolyzes a chromogenic peptide substrate Glp-Ala-Ala-Leu-pNA optimally at pH 8.0. Maximal activity of the proteinase in the roots is attained in April, at the beginning of plant development after the winter period.

Union cavalry raiders under the command of Col. Benjamin Grierson, in an effort to disrupt Confederate communications, probed deep in enemy territory and entered the town of Newton's Station (now Newton). They succeeded in securing the town without any serious fighting, and captured two Confederate trains. The raiders also destroyed several miles of railroad track and telegraph wires in the vicinity, severing communications between Confederate- held Vicksburg and the Eastern Theatre commanders. The two trains (one a freight and the second a mixed freight and passenger) were actually captured by Lt-Colonel William Blackburn, who had ridden ahead in darkness to scout the town. His men set fire to the trains, and exploding ammunition led the nearby Grierson to assume the worst, that a major battle had started. He arrived with the main force to find Blackburn's men helping themselves to confiscated whiskey. Over the next few hours Union forces destroyed trackage and equipment, east to the Chunky River and west as far as possible. A large building in the town with uniforms and arms was burned, and the railroad depot was burned (not before local hospital staff were allowed to remove medicine and food). Assembling his forces Grierson departed the area around 2pm, leaving ruin and wreckage. The Battle of Newton's Station and Grierson's cavalry exploits starting in La Grange, Tennessee were the basis of the 1959 movie The Horse Soldiers, directed by John Ford, starring John Wayne and William Holden.

I-77 has a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 48 (Bluff Road), crosses Gills Creek, and meets SC 768 (Shop Road) at a cloverleaf interchange. I-77 enters the city of Columbia at its crossings of Norfolk Southern Railway's SC Line and CSX's Eastover Subdivision. The freeway has a connected pair of elongated partial cloverleaf interchanges with US 76 and US 378 (Garners Ferry Road) and SC 262 (Leesburg Road). The Interstate passes through an S-curve, within which the highway has a diamond interchange with SC 760 (Fort Jackson Boulevard), then follows the western edge of Fort Jackson. I-77 has a diamond interchange with Forest Drive and Strom Thurmond Boulevard and a partial interchange with Decker Boulevard as it veers northeast. The freeway veers north and leaves the military base and the city of Columbia at its partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 12 (Percival Road). I-77 southbound ends at I-26. I-77 passes through the unincorporated suburb of Woodfield and meets I-20 at an interchange with a pair of flyover ramps; there is no access from eastbound I-20 to northbound I-77. The Interstate continues as a six-lane freeway across Windsor Lake into the suburb of Dentsville. The freeway passes under CSX's Hamlet Subdivision and has a partial cloverleaf interchange with US 1 (Two Notch Road). I-77 has a partial interchange with SC 277; the interchange includes ramps from southbound I-77 to SC 277 and from SC 277 to northbound I-77. Intertwined with the SC 277 interchange is a partial cloverleaf interchange with SC 555 (Farrow Road); within the interchange, the freeway passes under Norfolk Southern's R-Line. I-77 widens to an eight-lane freeway while it crossed at the interchange with SC 555. As it leaves the Columbia area, I-77 has a diamond interchange with Killian Road, I-77 downgrades to a six-lane freeway while it's crossed Killian Road. I-77 continues and crosses US 21 with a partial cloverleaf interchange, (Wilson Boulevard). North of its diamond interchange with Blythewood Road in Blythewood, the highway enters Fairfield County. I-77 meets SC 34 west of the town of Ridgeway and passes under the NS R-Line. The freeway passes to the east of Winnsboro, which is accessed via SC 34 or the next interchange with Road 41. I-77 has junction with Road 20 and SC 200 near Mitford before entering Chester County. The freeway has an interchange with SC 97 (Great Falls Road), which connects the county seat of Chester to the west with the town of Great Falls to the east. Great Falls is where the Piedmont- based Catawba River reaches the Fall Line and becomes the Wateree River of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. At Richburg, I-77 has interchanges with Road 56 and SC 9 (Lancaster Highway) just before the freeway enters York County. The highway has interchanges with SC 901 (Mount Holly Road) and Porter Road on the southeast side of Rock Hill. I-77 expands to eight lanes at its partial cloverleaf interchange with US 21 and SC 5 (Anderson Road) and enters the city of Rock Hill. The freeway has a diamond interchange with SC 122 (Dave Lyle Boulevard) west of the Rock Hill Galleria. North of its underpass of the Columbia District rail line, I-77 has a pair of connected partial cloverleaf interchanges with US 21 (Cherry Road) and SC 161 (Celanese Road). The Interstate then leaves the city of Rock Hall by crossing the Catawba River. I-77 has interchanges with Sutton Road and SC 160 (Steele Creek Road) as it passes along the western edge of Fort Mill. North of Fort Mill, the Interstate has a diamond interchange with SC 460 (Gold Hill Road). SC 460 provided access to the former Knights Stadium, home of the Charlotte Knights of minor league baseball until 2014, when the team moved into BB&T; Ballpark in Uptown Charlotte. I-77's final interchange in South Carolina is with Carowinds Boulevard, which provides access to the Carowinds theme park immediately to the west on the South Carolina-North Carolina state line. At the partial cloverleaf interchange, US 21 begins to run concurrently with I-77; the two highways cross the state line together into the city of Charlotte. =Services= The South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) operates and maintains one welcome center and two rest areas along I-77. The welcome center, which has a travel information facility on site, is located in Fort Mill at mile marker 89 (southbound), and the rest areas are located in Richburg at mile markers 65 (north and southbound) between Exits 65 (SC 9) and 73 (SC 901). Common at all locations are public restrooms, public telephones, vending machines, picnic area and barbecue grills. The South Carolina Department of Public Safety (SCDPS) and State Transport Police (STP) operate and maintain two truck inspection/weigh stations. Both truck weigh station can be found in Rock Hill. The northbound weigh station can be found at mile marker 89, and the southbound weigh station can be found at mile marker 85. History I-20/I-77 Interstate 77 was originally planned to terminate at Interstate 85 in Charlotte, North Carolina; in 1969, U.S. Congress passed an amendment to the Interstate Highway act to extend the route south along US 21 into South Carolina, where it would continue south terminating at I-20, near Columbia, South Carolina. The proposed routing started appearing around 1971, going south from a stub freeway section of US 21, from the North Carolina state line, to US 21/SC 5, near Rock Hill; by 1975, the entire proposed route on all state and federal maps. The first section completed and designated as I-77 around in 1975, from US 21 (exit 90) to US 21/SC 161 (exit 82). In 1976, it was extended south to US 21/SC 5 (exit 77). In 1979, I-77 was completed and designated on a southern section from SC 277 (exit 18) to US 21 (exit 24). By 1981, the southern section extended north to SC 34 (exit 34), near Ridgeway; the northern section was also extended south to SC 9 (exit 65). By the end of 1982, the two sections merged, from SC 277 to the North Carolina state line. In 1987, I-77 was extended south to SC 12 (exit 15), which finally accomplished its original objective of connecting with I-20. However, one year prior, I-77's southern terminus was changed to end at I-26, in Cayce; this created the establishment of Temporary I-77 around Columbia. On June 15, 1995, I-77 was extended east around Columbia on both new primary routing and existing routing, replacing unsigned I-326 and Temporary SC 478\\\\. Temporary I-77 was also decommissioned that same year. In the mid-2000s, I-77 was widened to eight-lanes from US 21/SC 5 to the North Carolina state line. In 1976, I-77 received exit numbers along its routing; which were all renumbered in 1987-1988. =Temporary Interstate 77= Temporary Interstate 77 (Temp I-77) was a temporary designation that directed travelers from exit 116 on I-26, in Cayce, that went clockwise around Columbia, also overlapping I-20 and then SC 277, before connecting with mainline I-77, at exit 18. The routing affixed temporary shields from 1986 to 1995, when I-77 was extended south to its current southern terminus. =Interstate 326= Interstate 326 (I-326) was an unsigned designation of the six-lane limited access highway that traversed from Interstate 26, in Cayce, to SC 48, in Columbia. Established in 1976, the freeway was not completed until August 22, 1986; however it was only labeled as \\"To SC 48.\\" Around 1990, when the freeway was extended further north, it took the name \\"Temp SC 478.\\" The unsigned designation remained unchanged until June 15, 1995, when it was renumbered as part of I-77. =Temporary South Carolina Highway 478= Temporary South Carolina Highway 478 (Temp SC 478) was the designation of the six-lane limited access highway that traversed from Interstate 26, in Cayce, to US 76/US 378, in Columbia. Appearing in 1989, it overlapped the unsigned section of I-326 and then on new freeway, that opened around 1990, from SC 48 to US 76/US 378\\\\. On June 15, 1995, it was renumbered as part of I-77. Throughout its existence, it was signed as only temporary.

Graphic buttons had programmed behaviors such as invoking an animation, linking to another page, or exposing an additional level of detail. The system had three automatically created navigation aids: # a timeline showing thumbnail images of pages traversed; # a 'neighbors' display showing thumbnails of all pages linking to the current page on the left, and all pages reachable from the current page on the right; # a visual display of thumbnail page images arranged by page keyword, color coded by chapter. Unlike most hypertext systems, EDS incorporated state variables associated with each page. For example, clicking a button indicating a particular hardware fault might set a state variable that would expose a new set of buttons with links to a relevant choice of diagnostic pages.

The SYP was founded in March 1946 by socialists working inside the communist- dominated Finnish People's Democratic League (SKDL). Most of the founders were former members of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP). The SYP had many known politicians in its ranks but it never became a mass party. In 1955, the party split from the SKDL and was disestablished soon afterwards. The founders of the SYP included the so-called \\"socialist six\\" (in Finnish \\"kuutoset\\") who were expelled from the SDP parliamentary group in 1940 before the summer 1941 Continuation War against Soviet Union. Another important group was the former \\"peace opposition\\" which split from the SDP after the war. In autumn 1946 two members of the SDP parliamentary group joined the SYP/SKDL. Some of the socialists working inside the SKDL never joined the SYP. The first chairman of the SYP was J.W. Keto, former leader of the peace opposition. He was succeeded by Atos Wirtanen in 1948. In 1955, Wirtanen organized an extraordinary party congress in which it was decided that the SYP would leave SKDL. The congress, however, was held under somewhat shady conditions. The secretary of the congress was Wirtanen's wife and no representatives from the important Southern Workers Organization of Helsinki were present. Many leading members and sections of the SYP dismissed the congress, left the party and continued their work inside the SKDL.Kalevi Haikara: Is√§nmaan vasen laita (Otava 1975), pages 119‚Äì124.

Its southern terminus is at Massey's Landing in Long Neck, near the confluence of Rehoboth Bay and Indian River Bay and its northern terminus is at the Five Points intersection, where it ends at U.S. Route 9 (US 9), DE 1, and DE 404\\\\. From the southern terminus, the route runs west through residential areas of Long Neck before heading north through rural areas with some development. DE 23 is concurrent with DE 5 between the DE 24 intersection in Long Neck and Fairmount. It is also concurrent with DE 24 Alternate (DE 24 Alt.) between Hollymount and the DE 1D intersection in Five Points. The road was designated as part of DE 22 south of Fairmount for a short time in the 1930s, with DE 5 designated along the stretch between DE 24 and Fairmount by 1938; the remainder of the road was unnumbered. The road was fully paved by 1970. The DE 23 designation was assigned by 1994. Route description A view of DE 23 heading south from the intersection with DE 1D in Five Points DE 23 begins at a boat ramp parking lot at Massey's Landing in Long Neck, near the confluence of the Rehoboth Bay and the Indian River Bay. From here, the route heads west on two-lane undivided Long Neck Road through a mix of residential areas and marshland between Rehoboth Bay to the north and Indian River Bay to the south. The road winds west through homes, commercial development, and a few farms, passing south of the Baywood Greens golf course. Farther west, DE 23 comes to an intersection with DE 5/DE 24\\\\. At this intersection, the name changes to Indian Mission Road, and DE 23 begins a concurrency with DE 5\\\\. The two routes head northwest and cross Guinea Creek, passing through a mix of farmland and woodland with some housing subdivisions. In Fairmount, DE 5 splits to the northwest and DE 23 continues north on Beaver Dam Road. In Hollymount, DE 23 intersects DE 24 Alt. and forms a concurrency with that route, with the road curving northeast and crossing Bundicks Branch. In Five Points, DE 23 intersects DE 1D and turns to the north, with DE 1D/DE 24 Alt. continuing straight and curving to the southeast. A short distance later, DE 23 intersects US 9/DE 404 and turns east-northeast to join those two routes on the four-lane divided Lewes Georgetown Highway. DE 23 reaches its northern terminus at an intersection with DE 1, at which point DE 404 also ends and US 9 turns east to join DE 1\\\\. At this intersection, access from northbound DE 23 to northbound DE 1 is provided by a reverse jughandle. Past this intersection, the road becomes US 9 Business (US 9 Bus.). The section of DE 23 between the southern terminus and the north end of the DE 5 concurrency serves as part of a primary hurricane evacuation route from the Long Neck area to points inland. The route has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 14,359 vehicles at the northern terminus at DE 1 to a low of 1,740 vehicles at the south end of the DE 24 Alt. concurrency. The small portion of DE 23 that is concurrent with US 9/DE 404 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, what is now DE 23 existed as an unimproved county road. The portion of the present route that is concurrent with DE 5 was upgraded to a state highway by 1931. DE 22 was designated in 1936 along the portion of present DE 23 south of the DE 5 intersection in Fairmount. By 1938, DE 22 was decommissioned, with DE 5 designated on the portion north of DE 24 while Long Neck Road south of there became unnumbered. By 1970, the road was paved. DE 23 was assigned onto its current alignment by 1994. DE 24 Alt. was designated to run along DE 23 between Hollymount Road and Plantation Road by 2006. In 1991, the Five Points intersection was reconfigured to separate the DE 23 and Plantation Road intersection from US 9/DE 404, with a short connector road linking US 9/DE 404 to the two roads. In addition, a jughandle was constructed from eastbound US 9/DE 404 to northbound DE 1\\\\. There are plans to reconfigure the intersection between US 9/DE 404 and DE 1D/DE 23 that would realign DE 1D and DE 23 to intersect a longer connector road linking to US 9/DE 404 and build a direct ramp from southbound DE 1 to US 9/DE 404 at the DE 1D/DE 23 intersection. This project is currently in the design phase with construction planned to begin in 2024.

On 11 September 1938 the world's first chartered special train exclusively for rail enthusiasts was operated by the RCTS, using the ex-GNR Stirling 'Single' No.1 on a round trip from London Kings Cross to Peterborough North. War intervened to prevent further excursions of this nature but, on 25 May 1946, the Longmoor Military Railway ran a trip around its site for RCTS members then, on 30 September 1950, a tour of the newly formed Southern Region of British Railways ran from Holborn Viaduct to London Victoria using three different steam locomotives, including the Society's 'trademark' Schools class No. 30925 Cheltenham.Foreword by Rodney Lissenden (then Chairman of the RCTS in Vintage Railtours, Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, A pictorial record 1954-69 by Gavin Morrison, pub. 1993 Providing rail tours for enthusiasts in the UK became a major activity and over 300 ran from 1954 until 1993 when the privatisation of British Rail and a reduction in spare rolling stock made this type of operation untenable for the society. In 1978 the RCTS celebrated its Golden Jubilee with a weekend of major celebrations based on Cheltenham.The Railway Observer Volume 49, Numbers 592-594 At its Annual General Meeting, held at the Queen's Hotel in Cheltenham, members voted overwhelmingly to admit lady members for the first time and thereby started a trend from which many other railway societies have greatly benefited. Later that year, the Society restarted the organisation of overseas tours for members (after a gap of five years), commencing with the ambitious but successful \\"Golden Jubilee Tour\\" of South Africa.The Railway Observer Volume 49, Numbers 591 and 595 Several such trips then ran each year, mostly to Europe but also further afield such as two more visits to South Africa and one to India. From 1996, these have dropped to just one a year, usually to a different European destination on each occasion. From the late 1940s, the RCTS has set up branches around the country and today has 29RCTS Website - 2020, comprising Bristol & District, Cambridge, Cheltenham, Croydon & South London, East Midlands, Furness, Lakes & Lune, Hitchin, Humberside, Ipswich & District, Lancashire & North West, Merseyside, Cheshire & North Wales, Milton Keynes, Northampton, North East, Peterborough, Scottish, Sheffield, Solent, South East, South Essex, South Wales / De Cymru, Surrey, Thames Valley, Watford, West of England, West Midlands, West Riding and Windsor & Maidenhead. As already mentioned above, the RCTS has become renowned for its many authoritative books, in particular its continuing series covering the development of steam locomotives in the UK. To allow it to become a recognised institution (allowing it to enter contracts for building leasesSpecifically, for the Society's Archive and Library at Leatherhead station), it became a Charitable incorporated organisation (CIO) from November 2016. Initially it has since functioned with both Trustees and a subordinate Management Committee, but is seeking to combine both governing bodies into one Board of Trustees from late 2020.Supplement to The Railway Observer Volume 90, Number 1093 References External links *Railway Correspondence and Travel Society *Historic film from 19:00 Category:Non-profit organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Rail transport in the United Kingdom Category:Railway societies Category:1928 establishments in England ","title":"Railway Correspondence and Travel Society"},{"id":"10783590","title":"Foot Locker Cross Country Championships"},{"id":"10783609","text":"Les Boyd (born 17 November 1956) is an Australian former rugby league footballer who played in the 1970s and 1980s. He played representative football for the Australian national side in international matches as well as the New South Wales side in the State of Origin. Boyd played club football in both Australia and England and his usual position was in the . Biography Born in Nyngan, New South Wales on 17 November 1956, Boyd later attended Nyngan High School. Whilst there he played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1972 under his future Western Suburbs coach Roy Masters. =Professional playing career= From 1976 to 1984 Boyd played in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership for the Western Suburbs Magpies, then the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles. He was selected to go on the 1978 Kangaroo tour and his hard running saw him emerge as one of the star forwards on the tour, culminating with him forcing his way into the test team for the final two Ashes tests against Great Britain. Boyd made his test d√©but for the Kangaroos when selected on the bench for the second Ashes test at Bradford's Odsal Stadium. In 1980, he successfully sued Mirror Newspapers Ltd for publishing an article that stated he was 'fat, slow and predictable'. During the 1982 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia and Papua New Guinea, Boyd was selected to play for the Kangaroos at second-row forward in both Test matches against the Kiwis. Later that year, Boyd made his second Kangaroo Tour when he was part of the undefeated 1982 Kangaroos side who became known as \\"The Invincibles\\". Despite normally being a second row forward, he played all three tests against Great Britain in the front row, scoring a try in the first test at Boothferry Park in Hull. The hard running forward was sent off in the first half of the second test at Central Park in Wigan by French referee Julian Rascagneres for kicking Lions John Dalgreen. In fairness to Rascagneres, he had called a penalty against Boyd for a flop in the tackle and was looking back down field. This caused him to miss Dalgreen (who was on his back on the ground) lashing out at Boyd with his boot, kicking him in the shin as television replays clearly showed (the English-based touch judge also missed Dalgreen's kick, or ignored it, and only reported Boyd's retaliation). BBC commentator Ray French called Boyd's retaliation a \\"vicious kick\\", though it appeared he had also missed Dalgreen's action. Boyd's send-off didn't affect the Kangaroos though. Leading 15-4 at the time, they powered on to win the match 27-6 and along with it, retaining the Ashes they had held since the 1978 Kangaroo tour and keeping their record of not having lost a series in England since the 1959-60 Kangaroo tour. Boyd's volatile nature while on the field (which was in total contrast to his quiet off-field nature) also saw him sent to the sin-bin at the start of the second half of the third and last Ashes series test at Headingley after a fight which had broken out at the end of the first half. Boyd then reverted to his usual second row for the first test against France in Narbonne before again playing in the front row in the second test, the last match on the tour. While playing for New South Wales in the opening game of the 1983 State of Origin series at Brisbane's Lang Park, Boyd broke the jaw of Queensland forward Darryl Brohman with his elbow (rumours at the time stated that had Brohman's jaw not been broken, he was in line to make his test d√©but for Australia in the 1983 test series against New Zealand starting three days later. He would never again get that opportunity). Referee Barry Gomersall did not send Boyd off and only gave Queensland a penalty. Boyd was not cited by the NSWRL over the incident and the following day was actually selected in the Australian team for the New Zealand test but was forced to step down when Charlie Gibson, the Secretary of Brohman's club team Penrith, officially cited him. Many, including NSW coach Ted Glossop who appeared at the judiciary on Boyd's behalf, believe he was unfairly dealt with by the judiciary headed by lawyer Jim Comans who suspended the Manly forward for 12 months. At the time Comans was on a campaign to clean up the violence in rugby league and many felt that Boyd had been used as something of a poster boy for the campaign, with the punishment far outweighing the crime. Brohman later instigated legal action against Boyd over the incident, with the matter being settled out of court. During that same game, Boyd also targeted his Manly-Warringah teammate and Queensland back rower Paul Vautin. Close to half time, Boyd was tackled by Vautin who was penalised for not letting him up to play the ball. Boyd pushed Vautin who responded by throwing a punch which Boyd returned in kind. Things looked likely to escalate until Maroons replacement front rower Dave Brown (another Manly player), stepped in and hit Boyd, effectively calming things down. Ironically Brown (briefly) won the spot in the Australian test team that was widely tipped to be Brohman's. In 1984 while playing for Manly, Boyd was again suspended, this time for a record-equalling 15 months for eye-gouging of Canterbury hooker Billy Johnstone. The suspension effectively ended Boyd's playing career in Australia. =England= Boyd played out the rest of his career in England with Warrington (Heritage No. 855). He played , i.e. number 11, (replaced by interchange/substitute Kevin Tamati) in Warrington's 8-34 defeat by Wigan in the 1985 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1985‚Äì86 season at Knowsley Road, St. Helens, on Sunday 13 October 1985. He was man of the match winning the Harry Sunderland Trophy in Warrington's 38-10 victory over Halifax in the Premiership Final during the 1985‚Äì86 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Sunday 18 May 1986. Boyd played left-, i.e. number 8, in Warrington's 4-18 defeat by Wigan in the 1986‚Äì87 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1986‚Äì87 season at Burnden Park, Bolton on Saturday 10 January 1987. Post-playing In 2000 Boyd was awarded the Australian Sports Medal for his contribution to Australia's international standing in rugby league. Further honours came in September 2004 when he was named at in the Western Suburbs Magpies team of the century. Boyd currently works as a rep in the Riverina region of south western New South Wales for Lion Nathan.

His sister tries to find him a suitable woman, but his real passion is putting on amateur theatre productions of Oscar Wilde plays, particularly Salome. The film deals with his struggle, temptation, and friendships, and how they are affected by his homosexuality. Alfred is a bus conductor who recites poetry and Oscar Wilde play lines to his regular bus riders. This year he hopes to put together the Wilde play Salome. Alfie lives with his sister Lily. He lines up the church hall only telling the priest that the play is about John the Baptist. A new beautiful young rider, Adele Rice, is his perfect Salome. Alfie lives above the Carson Butcher Shop and he slates up the butcher as King Herod. He wants his bus driver Robbie to be John the Baptist, but Robbie refuses, saying he is no actor. When the theatre group meets, Alfie tells them that they are not doing The Importance of Being Earnest this year but rather Salome. Butcher Carson finds the play offensive and misses rehearsals. Byrne goes ahead with his amateur production with his friend Birdy as stage manager and Mrs. Crowe for costumes and assumes all is going well. Alfie's sister sets up a dinner date and a trip to the zoo with his leading lady, Adele. She tells Alfie she already had a boyfriend, John. Widow Birdie tells Alfie of the joys and benefits of marriage.

It runs in a generally northeast‚Äìsouthwest direction from DE 404 in Scotts Corner to Slaughter Beach, a town along the Delaware Bay. The road runs through the northern portion of Sussex County, passing through rural areas along with Greenwood and Milford. The route intersects DE 16 and U.S. Route 13 (US 13) in Greenwood and US 113, DE 1 Business (DE 1 Bus.), and DE 1 in Milford. DE 36 was built as a state highway in stages during the 1920s and 1930s. The road was designated by 1938 from DE 16 east of Greenwood to Fort Saulsbury (present-day Slaughter Beach) and was extended west to DE 404 by 1994. Route description DE 36 begins at an intersection with DE 404 in Scotts Corner, heading to the northeast on two-lane undivided Scotts Store Road. The road runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes, coming to an intersection with DE 16\\\\. At this point, DE 16 turns east to become concurrent with DE 36 on Hickman Road. The road enters the town of Greenwood and becomes Market Street, passing several homes along with a few businesses. The highway crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Delmarva Subdivision line at-grade before it intersects US 13 on the eastern edge of Greenwood. Past this intersection, DE 16/DE 36 leaves Greenwood and becomes Beach Highway, crossing the Nanticoke River. DE 36 westbound past US 113 in MilfordIn Saint Johnstown, the road becomes a divided highway and DE 36 splits from DE 16 by turning to the northeast onto two-lane undivided Shawnee Road. The road heads through agricultural areas with some woods and homes, passing through the community of Staytonville. Farther northeast, the road reaches the city of Milford. Upon reaching Milford, the route runs through residential areas and intersects US 113\\\\. Past this intersection, DE 36 becomes Lakeview Avenue and passes to the west of the former Bayhealth Milford Memorial hospital. The road forms the eastern border of Silver Lake, a lake along the Mispillion River, and crosses the Delmarva Central Railroad's Indian River Subdivision line at-grade. After this, DE 36 continues to the east on Causey Avenue past homes and businesses. In the downtown area of Milford, the route turns north onto two-lane divided Walnut Street briefly before it heads east on two-lane undivided Southeast Front Street. The route passes through the residential eastern part of Milford where it intersects DE 1 Bus. DE 36 leaves Milford and heads to the northeast on Cedar Beach Road, entering a mix of farmland, woodland, and homes. The road turns to the east, running a short distance to the south of the Mispillion River as it comes to a diamond interchange with the DE 1 bypass of Milford. Past this interchange, the route continues to the northeast. DE 36 winds east through a mix of farmland and marshland and comes to a drawbridge over the Cedar Creek in the town of Slaughter Beach. The DE 36 designation ends here, but the road continues past the drawbridge into Slaughter Beach where it becomes Bay Avenue and turns south to run along the Delaware Bay. The section of the route between Maple Avenue in Milford and Slaughter Beach is designated as part of the Delaware's Bayshore Byway, a Delaware Byway. DE 36 has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 9,681 vehicles at the eastern edge of Greenwood to a low of 1,854 vehicles at the eastern border of Milford. None of DE 36 is part of the National Highway System. History By 1920, a section of present-day DE 36 southwest of Milford was completed as a state highway while a portion leading further northeast into Milford was under contract as one; the remainder of the route existed as an unimproved county road. The portion leading into Milford was completed four years later, in addition to the segment of the road through Greenwood. A year later, the state highway was under proposal between Greenwood and southwest of Milford. The state highway between Greenwood and Milford was finished in 1929. All of current DE 36 was completed by 1931 except for the easternmost part of the road. DE 36 was designated to follow its current alignment between DE 16 east of Greenwood and Fort Saulsbury (now Slaughter Beach) by 1938, with the entire route paved except for the part near Fort Saulsbury. The unpaved portion was paved a year later. DE 36 was extended westward to its current terminus at DE 404 by 1994.

Silk production remained confined to China until the Silk Road opened at some point during the later half of the 1st millennium BC, though China maintained its virtual monopoly over silk production for another thousand years. Not being confined to use in clothing, silk was used for a number of applications within China, such as writing; the color of the silk worn also held social importance, and formed an important guide of social class during the Tang dynasty. Silk cultivation spread to Japan around 300 AD, and, by 552 AD, the Byzantine Empire managed to obtain silkworm eggs and were able to begin silkworm cultivation; the Arabs also began to manufacture silk at the same time. As a result of the spread of sericulture, Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market. The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Developments in manufacturing technique also began to take place during the Middle Ages (5th to 15th centuries) in Europe, with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing at this time. During the 16th century, France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful. The Industrial Revolution changed much of Europe's silk industry. Due to innovations in the spinning of cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture, leading to cotton production becoming the main focus for many manufacturers, the knock on effect of which was to cause the more expensive production of silk to shrink. New weaving technologies, however, increased the efficiency of production. Among these was the Jacquard loom, developed for the production of highly detailed silks with embroidery-like designs. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases at this time, however, caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never fully recovered. In the 20th century, Japan and China regained their earlier dominant role in silk production, and China is now once again the world's largest producer of silk. The rise of new imitation silk fabrics such as nylon and polyester have reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, being an attractive alternative due to their relative ease of care of low price; silk is now once again thought of as a luxury good, with much less importance than in its heyday. Early history The cocoon of the domesticated silk moth; unlike wild silk moths, its cocoon is entirely white =First appearance of silk= The earliest evidence of silk was found at the sites of culture in County, , where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BC. The species was identified as Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of a primitive loom can also be seen from the sites of culture in , dated to about 4000 BC. The earliest example of a woven silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a site in at . Scraps of silk were found in a culture site at in , dating back to 2700 BC.Tang, Chi and Miao, Liangyun, \\"Zhongguo Sichoushi\\" (\\"History of Silks in China\\") . Encyclopedia of China, 1st ed. Other fragments have been recovered from royal tombs in the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 ‚Äì c. 1046 BC). Charles Meyer, Des m√ªriers dans le jardin du mandarin, Historia, n¬∞648, December 2000. During the later epoch, the knowledge of silk production was spread outside of China, with the Koreans, the Japanese and, later, the Indian people gaining knowledge of sericulture and silk fabric production. Allusions to the fabric in the Old Testament show that it was known in Western Asia in biblical times. \\"Soie'\\" (¬ß2. Historique), Encyclop√©die Encarta Scholars believe that starting in the 2nd century BC, the Chinese established a commercial network aimed at exporting silk to the West. Silk was used, for example, by the Persian court and its king, Darius III, when Alexander the Great conquered the empire. Even though silk spread rapidly across Eurasia, with the possible exception of Japan, its production remained exclusively Chinese for three millennia. Detail of silk ritual garment from a 4th-century BC, era, China =Myths and legends= A lacquerware painting from the Tomb (Chinese: ; Pinyin: ) of the State of Chu (704 ‚Äì 223 BC), depicting men wearing traditional silk dress and riding in a two horsed chariot Many myths and legends exist as to the exact origin of silk production; the writings of both Confucius and Chinese tradition recount that, in about 3000 BC, a silk worm's cocoon fell into the tea cup of the Empress . Wishing to extract it from her drink, the 14-year-old girl began to unroll the thread of the cocoon; seeing the long fibres that constituted the cocoon, the Empress decided to weave some of it, and so kept some of the cocoon to do so. Having observed the life of the silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms - sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Knowledge of silk production eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan, likely around the early 1st century AD.Hill (2009), \\"Appendix A: Introduction of Silk Cultivation to Khotan in the 1st Century AD.\\", pp. 466-467. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, decided to break the imperial ban on silk worm exportation. Though silk was exported to foreign countries in great amounts, sericulture remained a secret that the Chinese carefully guarded; consequently, other cultures developed their own accounts and legends as to the source of the fabric. In classical antiquity, most Romans, great admirers of the cloth, were convinced that the Chinese took the fabric from tree leaves. This belief was affirmed by Seneca the Elder in his work Phaedra, and by Virgil in his work Georgics. Pliny the Elder notably accurately determined where silk came from; speaking of the bombyx or silk moth, he wrote in his Natural History that, \\"They weave webs, like spiders, that become a luxurious clothing material for women, called silk.\\"Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 11.xxvi.76 Silk usage in Ancient and Medieval China In China, silk worm farming was originally restricted to women, and many women were employed in the silk making industry. Even though some saw the development of a luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the were used to limit its use to the members of the imperial family. For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, due to its shimmering appearance, created by the silk fibre's prismatic structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society, though this was mainly the uppermost noble classes. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making all utilised silk. Peasants, however, did not have the right to wear silk until the dynasty (1644‚Äì1911). Paper was one of the greatest discoveries of ancient China. Beginning in the 3rd century BC, paper was made in all sizes with various materials. Histoire des techniques p.455 Silk was no exception, and silk workers had been making paper since the 2nd century BC. Silk, bamboo, linen, wheat and rice straw were all used, and paper made with silk became the first type of luxury paper. Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a marchioness, who died around 168, in . The material was certainly more expensive, but also more practical than bamboo slips. Treatises on many subjects, including meteorology, medicine, astrology, divinity, and even maps written on silk have been discovered. silk clothes, by (active 1130s-1160s), Song dynasty During the Han dynasty, silk became progressively more valuable in its own right, and became more than simply a material. It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, the length of the silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring countries; beginning in the 2nd century BC, the people regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace. Silk is described in a chapter of the from the Western Han (206 BC ‚Äì 9 AD). There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han (25 ‚Äì 220 AD) document. The two other known works on silk from the Han period are lost. For more than a millennium, silk remained the principal diplomatic gift of the emperor of China to his neighbors or to his vassals. The use of silk became so important that the character for silk () soon constituted one of the principal radicals of Chinese script. Broadly speaking, the use of silk was regulated by a very precise code in China. For example, the Tang Dynasty and Song Dynasty imposed upon bureaucrats the use of particular colors according to their functions in society. Under the Ming Dynasty, silk began to be used in a series of accessories: handkerchiefs, wallets, belts, or even an embroidered piece of fabric displaying dozens of animals, real or mythical. These fashion accessories remained associated with a particular position: there was specific headgear for warriors, for judges, for nobles, and others for religious use. The women of high Chinese society heeded codified practices and used silk in their garments to which they added countless motifs. A 17th-century work, Jin Ping Mei, gives a description of one such motif: File:Women placing silkworms on trays together with mulberry leaves (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg The silkworms and mulberry leaves are placed on trays. File:Men preparing twig frames where silkworms will spin cocoons (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpgTwig frames for the silkworms are prepared.

File:Weaving the silk (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpgThe silk is woven using a loom. Silk production in South Asia The earliest examples of silk production outside China are from silk threads discovered from the Chanhudaro site in the Indus Valley Civilisation which are dated to 2450‚Äì2000 BC. The analysis of the silk fibres shows presence of reeling and sericulture. This finding predates the one found in Nevasa in peninsular India in 1500 BC. The Siberian Ice Maiden discovered from the Pazyryk burials was found clad in a long crimson and white striped woolen skirt and white felt stockings. Her yellow blouse was originally thought to be made of wild tussah silk, but closer examination of the fibers indicate the material is not Chinese, but was a wild silk which came from somewhere else, perhaps India. Chinese silk and its commerce The main silk roads between 500 BC and 500 AD Roman fresco from Pompeii showing a Maenad in silk dress, 1st century AD Numerous archaeological discoveries show that silk had become a luxury material appreciated in foreign countries well before the opening of the Silk Road by the Chinese. For example, silk has been found in the Valley of the Kings in a tomb of a mummy dating from 1070 BC. First the Greeks, then the Romans began to speak of the Seres (\\"people of silk\\"), a term to designate the inhabitants of the far-off kingdom of China. According to certain historians, the first Roman contact with silk was that of the legions of the governor of Syria, Crassus. At the Battle of Carrhae, near to the Euphrates, the legions were said to be so surprised by the brilliance of the banners of Parthia that they fled. The Silk Road toward the west was opened by the Chinese in the 2nd century AD. The main road left from , going either to the north or south of the Taklamakan desert, one of the most arid in the world, before crossing the Pamir Mountains. The caravans that employed this method to exchange silk with other merchants were generally quite large, including from 100 to 500 people as well as camels and yaks carrying around of merchandise. They linked to Antioch and the coasts of the Mediterranean, about one year's travel from . In the south, a second route went by Yemen, Burma, and India before rejoining the northern route. \\"Histoire de la Route de la soie\\", Encyclop√¶dia Universalis Charles Meyer, \\"Les routes de la soie: 22 si√®cles d'aventure\\", Historia, n¬∞648 December 2000. Not long after the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC, regular commerce began between the Romans and Asia, marked by the Roman appetite for silk cloth coming from the Far East, which was then resold to the Romans by the Parthians. The Roman Senate tried in vain to prohibit the wearing of silk, for economic reasons as well as moral ones. The import of Chinese silk resulted in vast amounts of gold leaving Rome, to such an extent that silk clothing was perceived as a sign of decadence and immorality. In the late Middle Ages, transcontinental trade over the land routes of the Silk Road declined as sea trade increased. The Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of the civilizations of China, India, Ancient Egypt, Persia, Arabia, and Ancient Rome. Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, many other goods were traded, and various technologies, religions and philosophies, as well as the bubonic plague (the \\"Black Death\\"), also traveled along the Silk Routes. Some of the other goods traded included luxuries such as silk, satin, hemp and other fine fabrics, musk, other perfumes, spices, medicines, jewels, glassware, and even rhubarb, as well as slaves. China traded silk, teas, and porcelain, while India traded spices, ivory, textiles, precious stones, and pepper, and the Roman Empire exported gold, silver, fine glassware, wine, carpets, and jewels. Although the term \\"the Silk Road\\" implies a continuous journey, very few who traveled the route traversed it from end to end; for the most part, goods were transported by a series of agents on varying routes and were traded in the bustling markets of the oasis towns. The main traders during Antiquity were the Indian and Bactrian traders, then from the 5th to the 8th century AD the Sogdian traders, then afterward the Arab and Persian traders. Spread of production Sassanid inspired two-sided silk cloth, with winged lions and tree of life, from the early Islamic period in Iran, National Museum of Iran. Although silk was well known in Europe and most of Asia, China was able to keep a near monopoly on silk production. The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs. Only around the year 300 AD did a Japanese expedition succeed in taking some silkworm eggs and four young Chinese girls, who were forced to teach their captors the art of sericulture.Cook, (1999), 144. Techniques of sericulture were subsequently introduced to Japan on a larger scale by frequent diplomatic exchanges between the 8th and 9th centuries. Starting in the 4th century BC silk began to reach the Hellenistic world by merchants who would exchange it for gold, ivory, horses or precious stones. Up to the frontiers of the Roman Empire, silk became a monetary standard for estimating the value of different products. Hellenistic Greece appreciated the high quality of the Chinese goods and made efforts to plant mulberry trees and breed silkworms in the Mediterranean basin. Sassanid Persia controlled the trade of silk destined for Europe and Byzantium. The Greek word for \\"silken\\" was œÉŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, from the name of the Seres (Œ£·øÜœÅŒµœÇ), according to Strabo the people from whom silk was first obtained.Strabo 11.11.1, 15.1.34. The adjective œÉŒ∑œÅŒπŒ∫œåœÇ is recorded in the 2nd century AD, found in Lucian ( De saltatione 63), Cassius Dio (43.24), Pausanias (6.26.6). The Greek word gave rise to Latin sericum and ultimately Old English sioloc, Middle English silk. The monks sent by Justinian give the silkworms to the emperor. According to a story by Procopius, it was not until 552 AD that the Byzantine emperor Justinian obtained the first silkworm eggs. He had sent two Nestorian monks to Central Asia, and they were able to smuggle silkworm eggs to him hidden in rods of bamboo. While under the monks' care, the eggs hatched, though they did not cocoon before arrival. The church manufacture in the Byzantine Empire was thus able to make fabrics for the emperor, with the intention of developing a large silk industry in the Eastern Roman Empire, using techniques learned from the Sassanids. These gynecia had a legal monopoly on the fabric, but the empire continued to import silk from other major urban centres on the Mediterranean. Catherine Jolivet-L√©vy and Jean-Pierre Sodini (2006), \\"Byzance\\", in Encyclop√¶dia Universalis The magnificence of the Byzantine techniques was not a result of the manufacturing process, but instead of the meticulous attention paid to the execution and decorations. The weaving techniques they used were taken from Egypt. The first diagrams of semple looms appeared in the 5th century. Histoire des Techniques p.435 The Arabs, with their widening conquests, spread sericulture across the shores of the Mediterranean, leading to the development of sericulture in North Africa, Andalusia, Sicily Anne Kraatz, Marie Risselin-Steenebrugen, Mich√®le Pirazzoli-t'Serstevens and Madeleine Paul-David (2006), \\"Tissus d'art\\", in Encyclop√¶dia Universalis and Southern Italy's Calabria, which was under the Byzantine dominion. According to Andr√© Guillou, mulberry trees for the production of raw silk were introduced to southern Italy by the Byzantines at the end of the ninth century. Around 1050, he believes, the theme of Calabria had 24,000, mulberry trees cultivated for their foliage, and their number tended to expand. The first centre to introduce silk production to Italy between the 9th and the 11th century was the city of Catanzaro in the region of Calabria. The silk of Catanzaro supplied almost all of Europe and was sold in a large market fair in the port of Reggio Calabria to Spanish, Venetian, Genoese and Dutch merchants. Catanzaro became the lace capital of Europe with a large silkworm breeding facility that produced all the laces and linens used in the Vatican. The city was world-famous for its fine fabrication of silks, velvets, damasks and brocades.https://www.madeinitalyfor.me/en/info/lantica-e- nobile-arte-serica/ https://www.britannica.com/place/Catanzaro-Italy The interactions among Byzantine and Muslim silk-weaving centers of all levels of quality, with imitations made in Andalusia and Lucca, among other cities, have made the identification and date of rare surviving examples difficult to pinpoint. While the cultivation of mulberry was moving first steps in Northern Italy, silk made in Calabria reached the peak of 50% of the whole Italian/European production. As the cultivation of mulberry was difficult in Northern and Continental Europe, merchants and operators used to purchase in Calabria raw materials in order to finish the products and resell them for a better price. The Genoese silk artisans used fine Calabrian and Sicilian silk for the production of velvets. While the Chinese lost their monopoly on silk production, they were able to re-establish themselves as major silk supplier (during the Tang dynasty), and to industrialize their production in a large scale (during the Song dynasty).Heleanor B. Feltham: Justinian and the International Silk Trade, p. 34 China continued to export high-quality fabric to Europe and the Near East along the silk road. After the start of the Crusades, techniques of silk production began to spread across Western Europe. In 1147 while Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos was focusing all his efforts on the Second Crusade, the Norman king Roger II of Sicily attacked Corinth and Thebes, two important centres of Byzantine silk production. They took the crops and silk production infrastructure, and deported all the workers to Palermo, thereby causing the Norman silk industry to flourish. Georges Ostrogorsky, Histoire de l'√©tat byzantin, Payot, 1956, reedited in 1977, The sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204 brought decline to the city and its silk industry, and many artisans left the city in the early 13th century. Italy developed a large domestic silk industry after 2000 skilled weavers came from Constantinople. Many also chose to settle in Avignon to furnish the popes of Avignon. The sudden boom of the silk industry in the Italian state of Lucca, starting in the 11th and 12th centuries was due to much Sicilian, Jewish, and Greek settlement, alongside many other immigrants from neighbouring cities in southern Italy. Histoire des techniques p.551 With the loss of many Italian trading posts in the Orient, the import of Chinese styles drastically declined. Gaining momentum, in order to satisfy the rich and powerful bourgeoisie's demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of Lucca, Genoa, Venice and Florence were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone. Emperor Charles V formally recognized the growth of the industry of Catanzaro in 1519 by allowing the city to establish a consulate of the silk craft, charged with regulating and check in the various stages of a production that flourished throughout the sixteenth century. At the moment of the creation of its guild, the city declared that it had over 500 looms. By 1660, when the town had about 16,000 inhabitants, its silk industry kept 1,000 looms, and at least 5,000 people, busy. The silk textiles of Catanzaro were not only sold at the kingdom's markets, they were also exported to Venice, France, Spain and England. =Reciprocal influences= Polychrome embroidery in silk, 17th century, Antwerp French silk brocade - Lyon 1760-1770 Silk was made using various breeds of lepidopterans, both wild and domestic. While wild silks were produced in many countries, there is no doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective species for silk production, the Bombyx mandarina and its domesticated descendant B. mori. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large spool, thanks to a backwards and forward motion. Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China. The spinning wheel, in all likelihood moved by hand, was known by the beginning of the Christian era. The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210. There is an image of a silk spinning machine powered by a water wheel that dates to 1313. More information is known about the looms used. The Nung Sang Chi Yao, or Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture, compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk.Joseph Needham, Francesca Bray, Hsing-Tsung Huang, Christian Daniels, Nicholas K. Menzies, Science and Civilisation in China, Cambridge University Press, 1984 p. 72 It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the drawloom, which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the Jin dynasty, the existence of silk damasks has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BC, four-shafted looms and other innovations allowed the creation of silk brocades. Silk in the medieval world =A more abundant luxury= A mature mulberry tree in Provence. The high Middle Ages saw continued use of established techniques for silk manufacture without any changes to speak of, neither in materials nor in tools used. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, small changes began to appear, though the changes of the 13th century were much larger and more radical. In a short time, new fabrics began to appear; hemp and cotton each also had their own particular techniques of manufacture. Known since Roman times, silk remained a rare and expensive material. Byzantine magnaneries in Greece and Syria (6th to 8th centuries), the ones in Calabria and those of the Arabs in Sicily and Spain (8th to 10th centuries) were able to supply the luxury material in a much greater abundance.Xinru Liu, Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People AD 600-1200, Oxford University Press US, 1998. =Improved technology= The 13th century saw an already changing technology undergo many dramatic changes. It is possible that, as with in England at the end of the 18th century, advances in the textile industry were a driving force behind advances in technology as a whole. Silk indeed occupies a privileged place in history on account of this. Histoire des Techniques p.553 At the start of the 13th century, a primitive form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 Jean de Garlande's dictionary, and in 1226, √âtienne Boileau's Livre des m√©tiers (Tradesman's Handbook) enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in Bologna between 1270 and 1280. From the start of the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex. Histoire des Techniques p.557 The reel, originally developed for the silk industry, now has multiple uses. The earliest surviving depiction of a European spinning wheel is a panel of stained glass in the Cathedral of Chartres.Ronan (1994), 68, Bobbins and warping machines appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a fresco in the Cologne Kunkelhaus (ca 1300). It is possible that the toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry; it allowed the warp to be more uniform and allowed the warp to be of a longer length. Starting at the end of the 14th century, no doubt on account of the devastation caused mid- century by the Black Death, there was a general shift towards less expensive techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the guilds were now commonplace (using low quality wool, carding, etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use. Histoire des Techniques p.639 =The silk industry in France= A picture from the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and d'Alembert, showing the different steps in sericulture and the manufacture of silk. Italian silk cloth was very expensive, as much a result of the cost of the raw material as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials. Autour du Fil, l'encyclop√©die des arts textiles These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes. Following the example of the wealthy Italian city-states of the era, such as Venice, Florence, and Lucca, which had become the center of the luxury-textile industry, Lyon obtained a similar function in the French market. In 1466, King Louis XI decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon and called a large number of Italian workers, mainly from Calabria. The drawloom that appeared in those years in France was called loom by Jean Le Calabrais. In the face of protests by the Lyonnais, he conceded and moved the silk fabrication to Tours, but the industry in Tours stayed relatively marginal. His main objective was to reduce France's trade deficit with the Italian states, which caused France to lose 400,000 to 500,000 golden √©cus a year. Georges Duby (ed), Histoire de la France : Dynasties et r√©volutions, de 1348 √† 1852 (vol. 2), Larousse, 1999 p. 53 It was under Francis I in around 1535 that a royal charter was granted to two merchants, √âtienne Turquet and Barth√©lemy Naris, to develop a silk trade in Lyon. In 1540, the king granted a monopoly on silk production to the city of Lyon. Starting in the 16th century, Lyon became the capital of the European silk trade, notably producing many reputable fashions. G√©rard Chauvy, \\"La dure condition des for√ßats du luxe\\", Historia, n¬∞648, December 2000 Gaining confidence, the silks produced in the city began to abandon the original oriental styles in favor of their own distinctive style, which emphasized landscapes. Thousand of workers, the canuts, devoted themselves to the flourishing industry. In the middle of the 17th century, over 14,000 looms were used in Lyon, and the silk industry fed a third of the city's population. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Provence experienced a boom in sericulture that would last until the first world war, with much of the silk shipped north to Lyon. Viens and La Bastide-des-Jourdans are two of the communes of Luberon that profited the most from mulberry plantations that have since disappeared. Guide Gallimard - Parc naturel LUBERON However, silk centers still operate today.Waters, Sarah. ‚ÄúThe Silk Industry in Lyon, France.‚Äù Museum of the City. Accessed 6 October 2017\\\\. http://www.museumofthecity.org/project/the-silk-industry-in-lyon-france/ Working at home under the domestic system, silk spinning and silk treatment employed many people and increased the income of the working class. =Spread to other countries= A former magnanery in Luberon England under Henry IV was also looking to develop a silk industry, but no opportunity arose until the revocation of the Edict of Nantes the 1680s, when hundreds of thousands of French Huguenots, many of whom were skilled weavers and experts in sericulture, began immigrating to England to escape religious persecution. Some areas, including Spitalfields saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used.Thirsk (1997), 120. Nonetheless, the British climate prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant. Many envisioned starting a silk industry in the British colonies in America, starting in 1619, under the reign of King James I of England. The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by Cortez in 1522. Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.Peter N. Stearns, William Leonard Langer The Encyclopedia of World History, Houghton Mifflin Books, 2001 p. 403 Silk since the Industrial Revolution Portrait of Maria Ivanovna Tatischeva by David L√ºders (1759) Moscow, State Tretyakov Gallery Mme Tatischeva is shown wearing a paduasoy silk dress. =The start of the Industrial Revolution= The start of the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with remarkable technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving. The silk industry, however, did not gain any benefit from innovations in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades is a very delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th and 18th centuries progress began to be made in the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph- Marie Jacquard improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary Jacquard loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. Histoire des techniques p.718 The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced. The Jacquard loom was immediately denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon it had become vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834. =Decline in the European silk industry= The first silkworm diseases began to appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are p√©brine, caused by the microsporidia Nosema bombycis, grasserie, caused by a virus, flacherie, caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or white muscardine disease, caused by the fungus Beauveria bassiana. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist Jean-Baptiste Dumas, French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked Louis Pasteur to study the disease, starting in 1865.\\"Louis Pasteur,\\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007. Archived 2009-11-01. For many years, Pasteur thought that p√©brine was not a contagious disease. In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline. Nevertheless, the increase in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments of the bourgeoisie in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.A. J. H. Latham and Heita Kawakatsu, Japanese Industrialization and the Asian Economy p. 199 Starting from the Long Depression (1873‚Äì1896), Lyonnais silk production had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The synthesis of aniline was used to make mauveine (aniline purple) dye and the synthesis of quinine was used to make indigo dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated to the production of artificial silk (viscose), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.

Silk in modern times A woman weaving with silk threads in Hotan, China. Following the crisis in Europe, the modernization of sericulture in Japan made it the world's foremost silk producer. By the early 20th century, rapidly industrializing Japan was producing as much as 60 percent of the world's raw silk, most exports shipping through the port of Yokohama. Italy managed to rebound from the crisis, but France was unable. Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void. Asian countries, formerly exporters of raw materials (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments. During the Second World War, silk supplies from Japan were cut off, so western countries were forced to find substitutes. Synthetic fibres such as nylon were used in products such as parachutes and stockings, replacing silk. Even after the war, silk was not able to regain many of the markets lost, though it remained an expensive luxury product. Postwar Japan, through improvements in technology and a protectionist market policy, became the world's foremost exporter of raw silk, a position it held until the 1970s. The continued rise in the importance of synthetic fibres and loosening of the protectionist economy contributed to the decline of Japan's silk industry, and by 1975 it was no longer a net exporter of silk. With its recent economic reforms, the People's Republic of China has become the world's largest silk producer. In 1996 it produced 58,000 tonnes out of a world production of 81,000, followed by India at 13,000 tonnes. Japanese production is now marginal, at only 2500 tonnes. Between 1995 and 1997 Chinese silk production went down 40% in an effort to raise prices, reminiscent of earlier shortages.Anthony H. Gaddum, \\"Silk\\", Business and Industry Review, (2006). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica In December 2006 the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of silk and other natural fibres.

He played on the Orix BlueWave, Yomiuri Giants, Nippon-Ham Fighters, and Milwaukee Brewers. Nomura recorded his name as \\"Takaki Nomura\\" from 2000 to 2003. Nomura was one of the relief pitchers in the Pacific League during his early career, and his team won two championships (1995 and 1996) with his contributions from the bullpen. He was valued as a left-handed reliever, and was known for his wide curve. However, he was only effective for his first 7 seasons (1991‚Äì1997), and has gone downhill ever since. Biography Nomura was drafted in the third round of the 1990 draft by the Orix BlueWave. He pitched well as a reliever, and recorded a 0.98 ERA pitching in 37 games in 1995, greatly contributing to his team's championship that year. He pitched over 50 games in 1996 and 1997, occasionally making saves. He was traded to the Yomiuri Giants in exchange for Masao Kida in 1998, but could not continue his previous success. He pitched in 40 games in 2001, but his pitching remained inconsistent, and was released after the season. He joined the Milwaukee Brewers in 2002, pitching in 21 games, and became the first and only player to wear the number 95 in the Majors. He marked an 8.56 ERA, and was released again at the end of the season. He returned to Japan, signing with the Nippon-Ham Fighters, but only made 6 appearances. He joined the Macoto Cobras (a professional team in Taiwan) in 2004. He returned to his hometown, K≈çchi, after retiring.

He has the second-most career interceptions in Browns team history, with 44. Lahr grew up in Pennsylvania and starred on the West Wyoming High School football team. After graduating in 1941, he attended Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and played football for the Red Cats as a reserve in 1942. He then served for three years in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He returned to Western Reserve in 1946 and became a star for the team as a left halfback for two seasons. Lahr was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) in the 1947 draft. He signed, however, with the Browns of the rival All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Lahr sat out the 1948 season with an injured knee, but quickly became a regular on defense the following season. He stayed with the Browns through 1959, a period during which the team won one AAFC championship and three NFL championships after merging into that league in 1950. Lahr has the second-most career interceptions in Browns history, trailing only Thom Darden. After leaving the Browns, Lahr settled in Aurora, Ohio and served as a color commentator for Browns games between 1963 and 1967. He died of a heart attack in 1969 at the age of 45. Early life and college Lahr Grew up in West Wyoming, Pennsylvania, a small town in the eastern part of the state. He attended West Wyoming High School, where he was a standout on the football team. West Wyoming, however, did not have a strong team, and Lahr's only college scholarship offer came from Western Reserve University, a small school in Cleveland, Ohio. Lahr graduated in 1941 and enrolled at Western Reserve. Lahr began as a reserve player under Western Reserve head coach Tom Davies in 1942, when he was a sophomore. He played halfback for the Western Reserve Red Cats. His college career was interrupted, however, by three years of service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Lahr returned to Western Reserve in 1946 and had a successful junior season as a left halfback. The Red Cats went undefeated against the three other rival Cleveland schools of the Big Four Conference, and Lahr was named to the 11-member All-Big Four city all-star team after the season. He also won the school's Jack Dempsey Adam Hat trophy for his performance. Lahr figured prominently in Western Reserve's offense as a senior in 1947. He was switched from halfback to quarterback midway through the season. The team, however, was less successful than the previous year. After the season, officials at the Mid-American Conference, of which Western Reserve was a member, ruled that Lahr and other players who had served in the war could have an extra year of eligibility to play football. Lahr had exhausted his eligibility by playing in 1942, 1946 and 1947, but was not expected to have enough course credits to graduate until 1949. Lahr, however, decided to forgo his extra year at Western Reserve and signed with the Cleveland Browns, a professional team in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) coached by Paul Brown. Lahr was also selected by the National Football League's Pittsburgh Steelers late in the NFL draft. Professional career Lahr came to the Browns in 1948 as a third-string quarterback, but had to sit out while recovering from a knee injury he suffered before the season began. The Browns went undefeated in 1948 and won a third straight AAFC championship. Lahr's first playing time with the team came in 1949, when Cleveland again won the AAFC championship. Brown came close to cutting Lahr when he made a mistake on defense during a preseason game against the San Francisco 49ers. Lahr, however, made the team and started the year as a left halfback. He was switched to safety in the middle of the season and played primarily on defense after Browns starter Cliff Lewis was injured. Substituting for Lewis, Lahr quickly became a regular starter on defense and finished the year with four interceptions. One of his interceptions came at the end of a divisional playoff game against the Buffalo Bills and helped the Browns retain a 24‚Äì21 lead. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL. Lahr stayed with the team after the transition and was a mainstay of the defensive backfield throughout the 1950s, playing opposite Tommy James. The Browns won the NFL championship in their first year in the league, when Lahr recorded eight interceptions, including two he ran back for touchdowns. He had two interceptions in the Browns' 30‚Äì28 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the championship game. Lahr continued to play mainly as a defensive left halfback in the following seasons, although he spent time at safety in 1952 and his final season in 1959. The Browns advanced to the NFL championship each year between 1951 and 1953, but lost once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Lahr was named a first-team All-Pro by sportswriters in 1951, when he had five interceptions and returned two of them for touchdowns. His blown coverage on a late-game touchdown catch by Jim Doran of the Lions in the 1953 championship was a major factor in the Browns loss. He was nevertheless named to the Pro Bowl after the season, having made five interceptions and returned them for 119 yards. The Browns repeated as NFL champions in 1954 and 1955 behind a strong defense and an offensive attack led by quarterback Otto Graham. Lahr was named a first-team All-Pro for the second time in 1956. Cleveland reached the NFL championship in 1957, losing to the Lions, and made the playoffs in 1958. Lahr stayed with the Browns through the 1959 season, when he was switched from defensive halfback to safety. He had 44 interceptions in his Browns career, which stood as the record for most team interceptions by a Browns player until it was later broken by Thom Darden. He also ran back five interceptions for touchdowns, which remains a team record. Later life and death After retiring from football, Lahr settled in Aurora, Ohio and served as the color commentator alongside announcer Ken Coleman for Browns games broadcast on WJW channel 8 in Cleveland between 1963 and 1967. He was dropped when CBS made changes to its broadcasting lineup in 1968, but continued to work on preseason games. He also worked as a sales agent for Lax Industries in Cleveland and ran a sporting goods business with his close friend Ed Lewis, the athletic director at Adelbert College, which was part of Western Reserve. Lahr died suddenly of a heart attack in 1969, when he was 45 years old. He had recently passed a physical examination, but had come down with the flu the previous week. He and his wife, Rowena, had five daughters. In 2008, Lahr was named a Browns Legend, an honor given by the franchise to a selection of the best players in its history.

What became known as airmobility within the United States Army was a direct result of the Howze Board's findings. It was named after its chairman, Hamilton H. Howze. History  The OV-1 Mohawk The roots of the Howze Board may be found in the 1960 Army Aircraft Requirements Review Board (commonly referred to as the Rogers Board, after its chairman, Lieutenant General Gordon B. Rogers). The Rogers Board concentrated on evaluating aircraft designs (both helicopters and light fixed wing designs) for the Army and did not develop plans for their operational use, focusing instead on design issues and the question of how often replacement designs should be considered. It did recommend that an operational use study be considered, and mentioned the possibility of creating a unit to test operational concepts.Tolson, pp. 8-9. Both these suggestions would find expression in the Howze Board. The Howze Board was also shaped by the growing conflict in South Vietnam and tensions between the Army and Air Force regarding the Army's aviation program in general. Under earlier agreements, the Army could only operate aircraft under certain weight and size restrictions. There were also limits placed on arming such aircraft. The Air Force focused its objections on Army fixed wing aircraft (the OV-1 Mohawk and Caribou), and the Caribou was transferred to the Air Force in 1966. Before the Howze Board \\"the Caribou and the Mohawk were the two major symbols of Army-Air Force disagreement and more time was devoted to these systems than to the entire mobility concept itself.\\"Tolson, p. 12-13. Quoted text on p. 13. International events and changes in the defense policy of the United States also played a role in the formation of the board. President John F. Kennedy's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, began his own review of the Army's plans for aviation in late 1961 and came to the conclusion that the Army's plan was perhaps not aggressive enough in light of recent events (South Vietnam, the Berlin crisis, and even the Army's own reorganization of its divisions). Feeling that the Army's response to his concerns was still too cautious, he took the unusual step of directing the Secretary of the Army to form a board to review the Army's plans for aviation (especially helicopters) with a fresh approach (a \\"new look\\"). This approach was to ignore past policies and restrictions, and shift from ground-based systems to airmobile systems \\"if it would improve capabilities and effectiveness.\\" McNamara's memo also named the individuals he wished to conduct this review, giving the Secretary of the Army no room to place his own appointees. Finally, McNamara indicated that he wanted the board to use field tests and exercises to validate its recommendations.Tolson, pp. 17-18. The Army's response to McNamara's memo was to form a board organized like the earlier Rogers Board. Howze, who had served on the Rogers Board (and was named in McNamara's memo), was selected to chair the Tactical Mobility Requirements Board on 25 April. The actual directive establishing the board was not issued until 3 May, after the board had started working, and Howze was given wide authority to deal with any agencies (military or civilian) he thought might be necessary for the board to complete its evaluation.Tolson, p. 20. Formation and organization The board was created by a letter from General Herbert B. Powell, Commanding General, United States Continental Army Command, dated 3 May 1962, although as noted above the board was already functioning by this date. Its eventual membership consisted of 240 military personnel and 53 civilians, not counting those assigned to troop tests, operational analysis, and war gaming. The Board consisted of a governing board, a review committee, an advisory panel, and a secretariat. An additional steering committee was formed from the board president (Howze), the review committee, and the secretariat. All but one of the men mentioned in McNamara's original memo were included on the board, either on the review committee or the secretariat. The bulk of the work was done by working committees and groups (seven committees between 5 May and 21 June, and eight groups from 22 June and July 31).Stockfisch, p. 15. :Notable members: ::General Hamiliton H. Howze, President General Hamilton Howze, the president of the board ::Brigadier General Joseph B. Starker ::Brigadier General Charles Billingslea ::Lieutenant General James H.

Heinemann ¬∞Indicates that the member was also a working committee chief.Tolson, p. 21 The board also created and supervised the working groups and committees previously mentioned. The seven committees were: Reconnaissance, Security, and Target Acquisition; Tactical Mobility; Fire Power; Logistics Operations and Logistics Support; Operations Research; Field Tests; and Programs, Policy and Budget. The eight working groups (formed after the committees finished their work) were: Counterinsurgency; Combat Forces; Logistics Forces; Long Range; Strategic Area; Operations Research; Field Tests; and Programs, Policy and Budget. These groups were formed around areas specifically mentioned in McNamama's memo, and were given a great deal of latitude when it came to their actual work.Stockfisch, p. 15, Notes 3 and 4. Work  The board started its work at Fort Bragg, using the Erwin School initially as it was available during the summer months.Stanton, p. 17. As the working groups and committees took shape, their work tended to take place wherever the group head happened to be assigned. For example, the chair of the Fire Power Working Group was assigned to Fort Sill, so the bulk of its work took place there instead of at Fort Bragg.Stockfisch, p. 16. While a good part of the board's work consisted of paper studies, the Field Test Group had wide authority to conduct exercises and tests of concepts developed by the other groups. The greatest constraint was time: the board was slated to report its findings to McNamara by 1 September, leaving about six weeks for testing and evaluation.Stanton, p. 21. The Field Test Group conducted a number of tests and exercise to evaluate the recommendations of the other groups. Using one battle group, resources from two others, and 150 aircraft (125 helicopters and 25 fixed-wing), the group conducted 40 field tests. Three of these were week-long tests; evaluating the ability of troops to function in swampy areas in Georgia, testing the concept in counter-guerrilla exercises in western Virginia, and finally a withdrawal under pressure scenario conducted in the Fort Bragg area. The tests used over 11,000 flying hours, many at low altitude and simulating combat conditions as much as possible.Stanton, p. 19-20 Smaller unit tests (16 in all) were conducted before these exercises, and a number of smaller tests took place at the same time to evaluate tactical mobility, firepower, reconnaissance, and logistics operations.Stockfisch, p. 16. The Board also made extensive use of war gaming to support its final report. This allowed the board to examine the utility of airmobility in larger operations and conventional warfare. For example, the main scenario was centered on the role an airmobile division could play in resisting a Soviet invasion of Iran. It also incorporated ideas forwarded by a team that visited Southeast Asia in June 1962.Stockfisch, pp. 17-18. Findings and conclusions The board submitted its final report to the Department of the Army on 20 August, and it reached the Secretary of Defense on 15 September.Stanton, p. 21, 23. The report was a large document (two inches thick according to one source)Stanton, p. 21. containing a number of recommendations in keeping with McNamara's original charge. The centerpiece of the report were a number of proposed organizations that would make maximum use of both helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft that were either in the Army's existing inventory or under development. The board also recommended that the number of aircraft assigned to existing Army units be increased.Davis, Richard G. \\"The 31 Initiatives - A study in Air Force-Army cooperation\\" page 15 Office of Air Force History, 1987. Accessed: April 15, 2014. It was the new organizations proposed by the board that drew the most attention. These ranged from smaller concepts such as an Air Ambulance Battalion designed to provide medical evacuation to larger combat units like the Air Assault Division, the Air Cavalry Combat Brigade, and the Corps Aviation Brigade (with a similar Army Aviation Brigade proposed for service in Europe). The Air Assault Division proposed replacing the bulk of a normal division's motorized transport with helicopters (459 compared to the 100 assigned to a normal division - enough to lift one-third of its assigned infantry at one time) and adding an attack aviation component (Aerial Rocket Artillery) to replace larger weapons that could not be lifted by helicopters. The Air Cavalry Combat Brigade was intended to \\"rely on aerial firepower\\" and operate in either an anti-armor or counterinsurgency role. Almost half of its assigned helicopters were to be attack versions, and it would be capable of lifting all its assigned infantry with its own helicopters.Stockfisch, p. 22-23. The board's concluding statement was simple: > Adoption of the Army of the airmobile concept-however imperfectly it may be > described and justified in this report-is necessary and desirable. In some > respects the transition is inevitable, just as was that from animal mobility > to motor.\\"Stanton, p. 21. Reactions and results The UH-1 \\"Huey\\" - key to many of the airmobile concepts produced by the board The Air Force, which had been a major part of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's strategic vision, reacted strongly to the findings of the Howze Board. It was Air Force Chief of Staff Curtis LeMay's position that the Air Force \\"should operate 'everything that flies, right down the last puddle jumper'\\", and he felt that the organizations proposed by the Howze Board would infringe on the Air Force's territory. Left unsaid was the fact that airmobility would be expensive, and the Air Force also feared a reduction in their portion of the defense budget and the resulting cancellation of programs.Trest, pp. 193-195. Quoted text on p. 195. LeMay directed the Air Force to form its own Board (chaired by Lt. Gen. Gabriel Disosway and known as the Disosway Board) to present its views on the subject. McNamara rejected the Disosway Board's conclusions, preferring the options developed by the Howze Board.Trest, p. 194. The Army's response to the board's report (and McNamara's favorable reception of its recommendations) was to create a special unit to test the board's main recommendation (the formation of an Air Assault Division). The 11th Air Assault Division (Test) was activated in February 1963 specifically to test the concept, and its commander (Major General Harry Kinnard) was given a great deal of control over the unit's organization and training (from selecting officers for command positions to an almost unlimited budget and scope of operations). Over the next two years, Kinnard's division conducted a number of exercises and maneuvers to demonstrate that airmobility was practical and flexible enough to meet the vision of the board's final report.Stanton, pp. 25-28. Many of the board's other recommendations remained paper ideas. Only one airmobile division was formed instead of the five suggested in the report, and other concepts never left the idea stage. The Air Cavalry Combat Brigade idea was never officially tested, although an improvised version did operate for a limited time in 1971 in South Vietnam.Stanton, pp. 237-238.

Released on the Herald label in 1963, this is a collection of gospel hymns, most having verses and a chorus. The album also features the World Vision Korean Orphan Choir. Each hymn is arranged in a similar way, with Ives and the choir sharing the vocals, and accompaniment provided by a piano and organ arrangement. Musicians are uncredited on the album cover. On many of the hymns the Korean choir sing sections in their native language. Ives, widely known as a singer of folk music, joins with the world-famous Korean Orphan Choir to sing these songs of \\"Faith and Joy\\". As he sang he was recalling nostalgic memories of the little wooden church in Southern Illinois where he sang many of these same hymns as a youth ... and later still when he was a lay evangelist, bringing the message of the love of God, through song and words, to audiences in many parts of the United States. Of the making of the recordings here presented he had this to say: \\"It was a beautiful experience singing with these children. In all of my life nothing has humbled and inspired me as this. The glow of their faces, and the warmth of their smiles brought the breadth of God's love into our presence as we sang these great hymns. It all fitted together ‚Äì as though it were meant to be. The simple message of the Gospel so clearly stated in words and music ‚Äì and so captivatingly shown in the lives of these little Korean orphans ‚Äì made a terrific impact deep within my heart.\\" Everywhere the Korean Orphan Choir go they bring living testimony of the work of World Vision throughout the world. They are indeed symbolic of the 18,000 orphans cared for by this organisation in 16 nations.

He played ten seasons for the Cleveland Browns between 1947 and 1956. Cleveland head coach Paul Brown, who coached Gillom in high school, college and professionally, called him his best all- around high school player and once said there \\"has never been a better punter than Horace\\". Growing up in Ohio, Gillom played for Brown on the football team at Massillon Washington High School, where he excelled as an end, linebacker and punter. In Gillom's three seasons between 1938 and 1940, Massillon won all of its games and captured two High School Football National Championships. Gillom followed Brown to Ohio State University in 1941, playing on the school's freshman football team before dropping out because of poor grades. He then entered the U.S. Army and served for three years in World War II. Upon his discharge, Gillom enrolled at the University of Nevada, Reno to finish his college career. He led the country in scoring in 1946 but left the school after the season, again because of poor grades. Gillom signed with the Browns, an AAFC team coached by Brown, in 1947. He handled all of the team's punting chores and played as a utility end on both offense and defense. Gillom's Cleveland teams won three straight AAFC championships before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the NFL. The Browns won the NFL championship in 1950 and repeated in 1954 and 1955. Gillom was a consistent punter, never averaging below 41.2 yards per kick in a season. His abilities declined in his later years, however, and he was released during the 1956 season. Gillom attempted a comeback in 1961 with the New York Titans of the American Football League, but failed to make the team. He moved to Los Angeles and worked as a security guard for the rest of his life. Gillom died of a heart attack in 1985. He was named in 2007 as a Cleveland Browns Legend, a grouping of the team's best-ever players. Gillom contributed to the evolution of punting by standing further back from the center than was usual at the time to give himself more room to make kicks. His kicks were also high, which gave the coverage team more time to get down the field and stop punt returns. Gillom's distance from center and emphasis on hang time were followed by later generations of punters. Early life and high school Gillom grew up in Massillon, Ohio and attended Massillon Washington High School. He was a star end on the Massillon football team like his older brother Odell, but was also a linebacker and punter. Bud Houghton, who coached him when he was in junior high school, said Gillom needed a step and a half more than usual to get his punts off, but he was the best he had ever seen once he made the kick. Houghton moved Gillom 15 yards behind the snapper instead of the usual 10, which gave him the room he needed. Gillom was a favorite of Massillon High football coach Paul Brown, who said in his autobiography that there \\"has never been a better punter than Horace.\\" Gillom played for the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played basketball and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon and was one of several black players on the team at a time when many northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands. College and military service Brown became Ohio State's head football coach in 1941 and recruited Gillom to the school. Gillom played on Ohio State's freshman team that year as an end opposite Dante Lavelli. Gillom was expected to move up to the varsity team the following year as a blocking back, but was kicked out of school in January for failing to maintain his grades. Brown later said Gillom did not fail any courses and was back at Ohio State doing \\"some extra reading in history that he can make up\\", but his struggles with classwork ultimately kept him off the Ohio State team in 1942. Gillom enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War II before he played on the varsity team. Gillom fought in the European Theatre of World War II and participated in the Battle of the Bulge near the end of the war. He was discharged after three years of service, having earned three Bronze Star Medals. By that time, Brown had become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns, a team in the new All- America Football Conference (AAFC). Brown wanted Gillom on the team, but changed his approach after signing fullback Marion Motley in 1946. Motley, a black star who played in high school for Massillon rival Canton, joined the Browns from the University of Nevada, Reno, where former Canton coach Jim Aiken was head coach. As compensation for drawing Motley away, Brown arranged for Gillom to go to Nevada for the 1946 season. Gillom led the nation in punting at Nevada that year, but left the school in December because of poor grades. Cleveland Browns Gillom signed with the Browns in early 1947, making him the third black player to join the team after Bill Willis and Motley. Before the season started, he played in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct matchup between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the best college players from around the country. Gillom played well in the game as the All-Stars beat the Chicago Bears, 16‚Äì0. With the Browns, Gillom was used mostly as a punter and a defensive end. He came in second in the AAFC in punting average in his rookie season at 44.6 yards as Cleveland finished the regular season with a 12‚Äì1‚Äì1 record and beat the New York Yankees to win the AAFC championship. \\"Gillom had such a powerful leg and kicked the ball so far; before that punters used to line up 10, 12 yards behind the center\\", running back Sherman Howard later said. \\"He started the 15-yard drop. And with Horace, he would kick it so high that by the time guys got down, the ball was coming down, so most guys had to fair catch.\\" The following season, Gillom saw time as an offensive end when regular Dante Lavelli broke his leg and was sidelined for seven games. Cleveland won all of its games in 1948, recording professional football's first perfect season and beating the Buffalo Bills in the championship game. The Browns won the championship again in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Gillom's salary was $6,000 ($ in dollars) in the Browns' last AAFC year. The 1950 season was another strong one for Cleveland. The team finished the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record, tied with the New York Giants for first place in the American Conference. This set up a playoff with the Giants to secure a spot in the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams. Cleveland won 8‚Äì3, thanks in part to Gillom's punts. His kicks repeatedly gave the Giants poor field position and pinned them near their own end zone. The Browns went on to win the championship against the Rams on a last-minute Lou Groza field goal. Gillom finished second in the league in punting average, with 43.2 yards. Cleveland reached the championship game in the following three seasons but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Gillom led the NFL in punting in 1951, with a 45.5-yard average. He again led the league the following season, averaging 45.7 yards per punt, and was selected for the Pro Bowl, football's all-star game. Gillom was second in the NFL in punting average in 1953. During his years with the Browns, Gillom's long, high punts and his habit of standing further back from center than was usual set a precedent followed by many of his successors at the position. His kicks had a long hang time, which allowed teammates to get further downfield to defend the punt return. \\"We didn't just go back 40 yards, we went back 50, 60 yards because he just kicked it so damn far and so high\\", Otto Schnellbacher, who played against the Browns with the Yankees and Giants, later said. Gillom's positioning behind the center gave him more space to kick but also put more distance between him and the opposing linemen, reducing the likelihood of a block. The Browns reached the championship game in 1954 and beat the Lions for a second NFL title. Gillom had the league's second-longest punting average for the second year in a row. Another championship followed in 1955. Despite his consistency, Gillom's punting slipped in his last years, and by 1956 he had to compete with rookies for a spot on the roster. At 35, he was Cleveland's oldest player and suffered from a sore back. He made the team but was released toward the end of the season in November. When he left the game, his career punting average of 43.8 yards was the second-best in NFL history behind Sammy Baugh's 45.1 yards. He never averaged below 41.2 yards per punt and was among the top three punters in his league in six of the eight years when he punted full-time. Because his punts were so long and high, opponents' punt returns were limited. He punted more than 400 times from the start of his career before one was returned for a touchdown. He was also a serviceable end, making 43 receptions when he played the position for periods in 1948 and 1949. Brown lauded his diverse abilities, calling him \\"the best all around athlete I coached at Massillon\\" and saying he was \\"successful at everything he did\\". Later life and death Gillom attempted a return to football in 1961, trying out for a spot on the New York Titans of the American Football League, a circuit formed the previous year. He was released, however, before playing in a game. He moved to Los Angeles in the 1964 and worked at the city's recreation department as a security guard. He was a \\"trouble chaser\\" who patrolled the city's parks without a uniform or weapon. \\"Any playground having trouble they call on me\\", he said in 1970. \\"The last one was a gang fight two weeks ago at a pool in Highland Park.\\" Gillom lived in Los Angeles for the rest of his life. He died in 1985 of a heart attack suffered while working as a security guard at a hospital. He had a son and a daughter with his wife, Mamie. Gillom was named a Browns Legend in 2007, an honor given by the team to the best players in its history. He was inducted into Stark County, Ohio's high school football hall of fame in 2009. Gillom still holds the Browns record for longest punt, at 80 yards, and is second in career punting yards behind Don Cockroft.

He also played for the Minnesota North Stars and St. Louis Blues. He owns two hockey stores in Florida. Minor leagues After a four-year junior career, principally with the Regina Pats of the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, that saw him play for the Memorial Cup in 1961 (with the Pats) and 1962 (with the Edmonton Oil Kings), Beaudin signed with the Montreal Canadiens organization, playing in 1963 with their farm team in Hull-Ottawa. The following year saw him claimed in the waiver draft by the Detroit Red Wings organization, where he spent the next four seasons, mostly with their Pittsburgh Hornets and Memphis Wings farm teams. In 1967, he was claimed by the Blues in the expansion draft, and made his NHL debut in that season, while spending most of the season with the Blues' Kansas City affiliate. He was loaned to the American Hockey League Buffalo Bisons in 1968, and subsequently played the next three seasons for the Cleveland Barons of the AHL. In that time, his rights were traded to the North Stars, for whom he played 12 games in the 1971 season. WHA career Beaudin was the first player signed by the Jets, and played on a line with superstar Bobby Hull and centre Christian Bordeleau in the Jets' inaugural season. He had his best pro season by far, as all three members of the line scored over 100 points; Beaudin contributed 38 goals and 65 assists for 103 points, and was named to play in the WHA's first All-Star Game in 1973. He led the WHA playoffs in scoring that year with a sparkling 13 goals and 15 assists as the Jets lost to the New England Whalers in the league finals, highlighted by a seven-point game against the Minnesota Fighting Saints. Beaudin's production dropped sharply the next season, and in 1974 he and Bordeleau were replaced as Hull's linemates by Swedish stars Anders Hedberg and Ulf Nilsson. After the Jets' AVCO World Trophy championship in 1976, Beaudin signed with Swiss team SC Langnau, with whom he played for two seasons before retiring. Achievements and facts Beaudin finished his WHA career with 97 goals and 155 assists for 252 points in 309 games, adding 37 points in 31 playoff games.

Named for Menelaus (in Greek mythology, a son of Atreus, king of Ancient Sparta, husband of Helen and younger brother to Agamemnon), she was the only US Naval vessel to bear the name. Construction LST-971 was laid down on 17 November 1944, at Hingham, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem-Hingham Shipyard; launched 20 December 1944; sponsored by Mrs. William Cosgrove; and placed in reduced commission 15 January 1945, with Lieutenant Peter F. Tripp, USNR, in command. Proceeding to Baltimore, Maryland, she decommissioned on 29 January; was converted to an ARL at the Bethlehem Key Highway Plant; and commissioned in full as Menelaus (ARL 13) 29 May 1945, with Lieutenant Peter F. Tripp, USNR, again in command. Service history =World War II= Having completed shakedown and fitting out by 2 July, the landing craft repair ship headed north to Davisville, Rhode Island, to take on pontoons for transport to forward areas. On 7 July, she departed the east coast, transited the Panama Canal on 15 July, and was two days out of Pearl Harbor when she received word of the Japanese surrender. Mooring in Pearl Harbor 16 August, she got underway again on 20 August, for Saipan, where she ably carried out her repair duties for the next six months. Departing Saipan 18 February 1946, Menelaus proceeded, via Hawaii, the Panama Canal, and New Orleans, to Galveston, Texas, arriving 17 June, to begin inactivation. Completing the process at Orange, Texas, she decommissioned 5 June 1947, and was berthed there as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. =Korean War= Recommissioned 14 December 1950, she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, for outfitting and on 24 March 1951, arrived at Norfolk, Virginia, to report for duty to ComAirLant. On 5 September, having added aviation supply duties to her role as a repair ship, she departed Norfolk for an extended tour with the United States 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. For the next four and a half years, with only one interruption for availability at Norfolk , 9 March to 15 August 1953, Menelaus operated throughout the Mediterranean. On 19 March 1955, she returned to Norfolk for her second pre-inactivation overhaul. In June, she steamed to Green Cove Springs, Florida, where she decommissioned 5 September. The ARL remained berthed in Florida, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet until struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 June 1960. On 28 October 1960 she was sold to the Norfolk, Baltimore & Caroline Line, which subsequently placed her in service as MV Maryland Clipper. She was sold in 1978, to the Thor Corporation of Venezuela, her final fate is unknown.

The gloves are designed to protect players' hands, wrists, and forearms from checks, or legal defensive hitting common in the sport. Gloves consist of thick padding on the back of the hand and forearm covered in leather or canvas material, and a palm area made of synthetic and mesh material. A goaltender's gloves may have extra padding for the thumb to protect against injury from shots. While NCAA collegiate rules require that men's gloves have palms covered, other leagues, including post-collegiate club lacrosse, the National Lacrosse League, Major League Lacrosse, and international play, permit players to cut out the palm area for greater grip and control of the lacrosse stick. Women's lacrosse rules do not require glove use, except for goalies since hitting is not permitted, but some players use smaller gloves for increased grip and minor protection from incidental contact. Considerations There are several things to look at when buying a pair of lacrosse gloves. The size of the glove is an important factor to consider, as well as protective features, what material it is made out of, ventilation, and dexterity. Many gloves now offer a wrist cuff which can be adjusted by various means to fit securely to your wrist and provide you with maximum comfort and protection. Lacrosse is a high paced game. Running up and down the field can be an intense work out, and having gloves that are well ventilated, allowing air to circulate in and around your fingers is crucial. All gloves take a little while to break in, though some take longer than others. The materials gloves are made out of differ. A glove with a mesh palm may be easier to play with, and provide great feel as well as ventilation. When buying lacrosse gloves you want to look for protection, ventilation, weight and flexibility.

He played seven seasons as an offensive and defensive tackle in the National Football League (NFL) during the 1950s for the Cleveland Browns and the Green Bay Packers before starting a 36-year career as an assistant coach. He was head coach of the Baltimore Colts for part of the 1972 season. Sandusky grew up in Philadelphia and attended the nearby Villanova University. He played tackle on Villanova's football team and was named a first-team All-American in 1949, his senior year. The Browns selected him in the second round of the 1950 NFL draft. Sandusky played six seasons for the Browns, who won NFL championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955 behind an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham and end Dante Lavelli. He spent the 1956 season with the Packers before ending his playing career. Sandusky started coaching at Villanova for two years before being hired as an assistant with the Baltimore Colts in 1959. He spent 13 seasons in Baltimore overseeing the offensive and defensive lines under head coaches Weeb Ewbank, Don Shula and Don McCafferty. Led by quarterback Johnny Unitas, the Colts won an NFL championship in 1959 and beat the Dallas Cowboys to win Super Bowl V in 1970. When McCafferty was fired midway through the 1972 season, Sandusky replaced him as head coach. Sandusky himself was fired after the season, however, and went on to spend three years as an assistant for the Philadelphia Eagles, followed by 19 seasons with the Miami Dolphins under Shula. His son Gerry is a radio broadcaster in Baltimore and calls Baltimore Ravens games. Early life and college Sandusky, who was of Polish and Irish heritage, grew up in South Philadelphia and attended South Philadelphia High School. After graduating in 1945, and serving his country in World War II, he enrolled at Villanova University outside of Philadelphia, where he was a starting tackle for four years. Villanova had winning records in each year Sandusky played there between 1946 and 1949 under head coaches Jordan Olivar and Jim Leonard. The team won the Harbor Bowl after the 1948 season. Sandusky was named a first-team All-American by the New York Sun in 1949, his senior year. Professional career The Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) selected Sandusky in the second round of the 1950 draft. He played mostly as a defensive tackle early in his career, but also worked on offense following the retirement of Lou Rymkus in 1952. Led by a strong defense and an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham and end Dante Lavelli, the Browns advanced to the NFL championship in each of Sandusky's six seasons with the team. The team beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the championship in 1950, but lost the ensuing three championship games to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Cleveland beat the Lions to win the title in 1954, however, and won it again in 1955 over the Rams. Cleveland coach Paul Brown traded Sandusky along with halfback Chet Lyssy to the Green Bay Packers in August 1956 for a late-round draft pick in 1957. While Brown called Sandusky a \\"fine football player\\", the coach wanted to replenish the roster with younger players. Sandusky played one year for the Packers before leaving football. Coaching career After retiring as a player, Sandusky began a long coaching career. His first job was as an assistant back at Villanova in 1957. He stayed there until 1959, when he was hired by Baltimore Colts head coach Weeb Ewbank, who had been an assistant with the Browns when Sandusky played in Cleveland. He was initially the defensive line coach for the Colts, who finished Sandusky's first season with a 9‚Äì3 win‚Äìloss record and won the NFL West behind an offense led by quarterback Johnny Unitas and halfback Lenny Moore. The Colts went on to win the NFL championship over the New York Giants. The Colts fired Ewbank in early 1963 and replaced him with Don Shula, who had been an assistant with the Detroit Lions and played with Sandusky in Cleveland in 1951 and 1952. Shula retained Sandusky on his staff when he took over, and the Colts went on to win the NFL West with a 12‚Äì2 record in 1964. The team was heavily favored to win the NFL championship game, but lost to the Browns by a 27‚Äì0 score. By 1965, Sandusky was the Colts' offensive line coach as the team continued to succeed with Unitas at quarterback. The Colts won the NFL Championship in 1968, but lost to the AFL Champion New York Jets in Super Bowl III. Sandusky stayed on as an assistant when Shula left after the 1969 season and was replaced by Don McCafferty. The Colts finished with an 11‚Äì2‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss‚Äìtie record in 1970 and beat the Dallas Cowboys to win Super Bowl V. The team reached the conference championship game the following year, but faltered at the beginning of the 1972 season. After starting with a 1‚Äì4 record, Baltimore general manager Joe Thomas fired McCafferty in October, saying the team was going to replenish its roster with younger players. The move was one of Thomas's first after new Colts owner Robert Irsay hired him at the beginning of the season. Thomas named Sandusky the team's new coach and charged him with replenishing the roster. At Thomas's urging, Sandusky immediately benched Unitas and replaced him with Marty Domres, a quarterback acquired from the San Diego Chargers in a preseason trade. While Unitas was in his 17th season and reaching the end of his career, taking him out was a controversial decision because of the success he had. Sandusky's run as head coach of the Colts was unsuccessful. Baltimore suffered a last-minute loss to the New York Jets in Sandusky's first game, followed by another loss to the Miami Dolphins. The Colts won four of their next five games, however, and finished the season with a 5‚Äì9 record. Although Sandusky managed a 4‚Äì5 win‚Äìloss record as coach, Thomas fired him and his coaching staff immediately after the season, saying he made the move only \\"because I thought it should be done\\". When Mike McCormack was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles in early 1973, he brought Sandusky in as an offensive assistant. Sandusky spent three years under McCormack, who had played with Sandusky as an offensive tackle for the Browns in 1954 and 1955. Sandusky rejoined Shula in 1976, becoming the offensive line coach for the Dolphins. He replaced Monte Clark, who had left the team to become head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. He stayed with the Dolphins for 19 seasons through 1994, all of them under Shula. The Dolphins advanced to the Super Bowl twice during Sandusky's tenure with the team, in 1982 and 1984, but lost both times. He was offered a job as director of pro personnel for the Colts before the team moved to Indianapolis in 1984, but he declined it, saying he wanted to stay near his family in Florida. Sandusky coached a number of linemen later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame during his 36-season coaching career, including Art Donovan, Gino Marchetti and Jim Parker with the Colts and Jim Langer and Dwight Stephenson with the Dolphins. Later life and death Sandusky was inducted into the South Philadelphia High School Hall of Fame in 1973. Sandusky's son Joe died in 1978 of pneumonia, and his wife Ruth died in 1985. Sandusky was married to his second wife, Shirley, until he died of complications from Alzheimer's disease, which was diagnosed in 2001, and internal bleeding while hospitalized in 2006. He had four living children at the time of his death and four Step-children. One of his sons, Gerry Sandusky, is the sports director at WBAL-TV in Baltimore and calls Baltimore Ravens games. Sandusky was considered a talented assistant. Long-time New York Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi once called him \\"the greatest coach in the history of the league that never got a chance\\".

The electrical systems and three completed units were ordered from the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works in 1942, but the war blocked delivery until 1948. Despite high failure rates the locomotives remained in service until 1982, and locomotive 1010--built by Werkspoor--is now preserved in the Dutch National Railway Museum. Planning In 1908 the first electric train in the Netherlands ran from Rotterdam to Den Haag and Scheveningen. It was electrified with a 10,000 volt 25 Hz AC power supply. After World War I the Dutch government decided to install a committee to investigate electrification of the Dutch State Railways, Nederlandse Spoorwegen, formed in 1917 but officially only established in 1937. For that, the committee members traveled the world to visit existing electrified railways. In the early 1920s they came to the conclusion that a 1500 volt DC system would be the best choice. Most Dutch electrified rolling stock were EMU's. During World War II the German occupiers used these EMU sets to haul heavy freight trains for their war effort. Origin of the Class 1000 (Netherlands) in Utrecht NS management already had contact with the Swiss company Oerlikon about ordering a series of electric locos before the war. They were to be based on the Swiss Ae 4/6 type. In 1942 the series was ordered, but the war prevented delivery until 1948. The order was subsequently changed to suit Dutch needs. The \\"Schweizerische Lokomotivenfabrik Winterthur\\" (SLM) would build 3 complete locos and deliver the electrical equipment for the remaining 7. These 7 would be built in the Netherlands, by Werkspoor. The series would be numbered 1001-1010 and had 6 axles in a 2-2+2+2+2-2 or (1A)Bo(A1) configuration. The arrangement was similar to the widely used 1‚Ä≤Do1‚Ä≤ arrangement of this period, but with the outer driven axles articulated as a bogie with the unpowered carrying axles, rather than the carrying axles being articulated as single axle pony or Bissel trucks. This configuration was already used successfully on the electrified railway network on Java, then a Dutch colony, but in the Netherlands it was a failure due to its complicated technology and high maintenance. 1500 Category:(1A)Bo(A1) locomotives Category:1500 V DC locomotives Category:Electric locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the Netherlands Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1948 Category:SLM locomotives ","title":"NS Class 1000"},{"id":"10784400","title":"Gregg Boddy"},{"id":"10784410","text":"Olaf of Norway ‚Äì Norwegian: Olav - may refer to: *Olaf Haraldsson Geirstadalf, reputed son of Harald Fairhair *Olaf I of Norway, Olaf Tryggvason, (reigned 995-1000) *Olaf II of Norway, Olaf the Saint, (reigned 1015‚Äì 1028) *Olaf III of Norway, Olaf Kyrre, (reigned 1067‚Äì 1093) *Olaf Magnusson of Norway, (reigned 1103‚Äì 1115) *Olav Ugj√¶va (died 1169), anti-king against Magnus V of Norway *Olaf IV of Norway, Olaf Haakonsson, also Olaf II of Denmark, (reigned 1380‚Äì 1387) *Olaf V of Norway, (reigned 1957‚Äì 1991) ","title":"Olaf of Norway"},{"id":"10784413","text":"Eddie Henderson (born September 11, 1967 in Seattle, Washington) is a retired U.S. soccer player and current Washington Director of Youth Coaching for the ISC Gunners program.

Optic pits are important because they are associated with posterior vitreous detachments (PVD) and even serous retinal detachments.  Signs and symptoms  Many times, an optic pit is asymptomatic and is just an incidental finding on examination of the eye by a physician. However, some patients may present with the symptoms of a posterior vitreous detachment or serous retinal detachment. This is because optic pits are associated with these disorders and are even speculated to be the actual cause of these disorders when they arise in patients with optic pits (see \\"Associated Retinal Changes\\" below for a more in-depth discussion on this theory). The most common visual field defects include an enlarged blind spot and a scotoma. Visual acuity is typically not affected by the pit but may get worse if serous detachment of the macula occurs. Metamorphopsia (distorted vision) may then result. Optic pits were first described in 1882 as dark gray depressions in the optic disc. They may, however, appear white or yellowish instead. They can also range greatly in size (e.g. some can be minuscule while others may be large enough as to occupy most of optic disc surface). Optic pits are associated with other abnormalities of the optic nerve including large optic nerve size, large inferior colobomas of the optic disc, and colobomas of the retina. The optic disc originates from the optic cup when the optic vesicle invaginates and forms an embryonic fissure (or groove). Optic pits may develop due to failure of the superior end of the embryonic fissure to close completely.  Risk factors  No particular risk factors have been conclusively identified; however, there have been a few reports that demonstrate an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance in some families. Therefore, a family history of optic pits may be a possible risk factor. = Associated retinal changes = Large optic pit (fluorescein angiography) Optic pits have been associated with serous retinal detachments in up to as many as 50% of all cases. These detachments may occur at any age but most frequently present in early adulthood. The most popular theory behind this association is a separation of the layers of the retina, known as retinoschisis, due to fluid (the vitreous humour) entering the optic pit and traveling between the inner and outer layers of the retina. The outer layer may then subsequently detach. Evidence of retinoschisis has been demonstrated using OCT. Centrally located optic pits are less likely to cause changes in the retina. However, if located more peripherally in the optic disc, then it is more likely to cause a serous retinal detachment. Furthermore, if the optic pit is located temporally (which the majority are), then it is more likely to cause detachment of the macula because of the macula's proximity to the temporal side of the optic disc. If serous macular detachment occurs, a patient's visual acuity may become as poor as 20/200 or worse. Treatment for optic pit-associated macular detachment involves photocoagulation of the retina by use of an ion laser (either krypton or argon). This procedure works by burning one or more rows in between the optic disc and areas of serous retinal detachment. In most cases, macular reattachment results and visual acuity can be restored to about 20/80. This procedure may also be utilized prior to macular detachment in order to help prevent the future development of macular detachment. Other treatments for optic pit-associated macular detachment include macular buckling, gas tamponade, or vitrectomy. Some experts feel that the best results can be attained when the use of any of the above-mentioned modalities (laser photocoagulation, macular buckling, gas tamponade, and vitrectomy) are used in combination.  Diagnosis  Optic pits should be diagnosed by an eye care professional who can perform a thorough exam of the back of the eye using an ophthalmoscope. More recently, the development of a special technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has allowed better visualization of the retinal layers. It has been used to demonstrate a marked reduction in the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer in the quadrant corresponding to the optic pit. This is not yet in standard use for diagnosis of an optic pit, but may be helpful in supporting a diagnosis.  Treatment  Optic pits themselves do not need to be treated. However, patients should follow up with their eye care professional annually or even sooner if the patient notices any visual loss whatsoever. Treatment of PVD or serous retinal detachment will be necessary if either develops in a patient with an optic pit.  Occurrence  Optic pits occur equally between men and women. They are seen in roughly 1 in 10,000 eyes, and approximately 85% of optic pits are found to be unilateral (i.e. in only one eye of any affected individual). About 70% are found on the temporal side (or lateral one-half) of the optic disc. Another 20% are found centrally, while the remaining pits are located either superiorly (in the upper one-half), inferiorly (in the lower one-half), or nasally (in the medial one-half towards the nose).

He led the minors in wins in 1995, but was given few opportunities in the Central League. Kashiwada joined the New York Mets spring training session in 1997, and started the season with their Triple-A team, the Norfolk Tides. He was promoted to the major leagues a few weeks into the season, then stayed up for the rest of the season. He had won only 1 game in Japan, but went 3-1 with a 4.31 ERA in 35 games with the Mets. He returned to the Giants the next year, and was used almost exclusively against left-handed hitters from 1999~2001, pitching in over 50 games in 1999 and 2000. The emergence of several other left-handed pitchers in 2002 (including Hideki Okajima) forced Kashiwada out of his role as a specialist against lefty hitters. He did not pitch a single game in 2005, and announced his retirement at the end of the season. He was re-hired by the Yomiuri Giants as an international scout after his retirement.

The screenplay focuses on a parking valet who is enlisted to pretend to be the lover of a famous fashion model in order to deflect attention from her relationship with a married businessman. Plot Pierre Levasseur is a wealthy married Parisian executive involved in an affair with top model Elena Simonsen. When a paparazzo catches the two of them departing their secret hideaway and their photograph is published on the front page of the local newspaper, Pierre's wife Christine confronts him. He claims he has no idea who the woman is, and that she must have been a companion of the man seen walking beside them. Fully aware of Pierre's difficult situation, Elena gives him an ultimatum: he must choose between her and his wife. Because Christine is the majority shareholder of his business, Pierre is in danger of losing his fortune if he divorces her. His lawyer Ma√Ætre Foix advises him the only way to resolve the issue is to find the anonymous man in the photo and have him pose as Elena's lover. The anonymous man is the hapless Fran√ßois Pignon, a parking valet who is in love with bookstore owner √âmilie. Deep in debt and worried about her business, she has turned down his marriage proposal because she believes she has too much on her plate, and thinks of him as a brother. Meanwhile, Ma√Ætre Foix locates Fran√ßois and offers him money to let Elena move in with him and pretend they are a couple. Fran√ßois agrees and asks for 32,450 euros: the exact amount of money that will pay off √âmilie's debts. Meanwhile, Elena demands 20 million euros to participate in the sham relationship, a sum she keeps as a deposit that she will return to Pierre when he leaves his wife. Dislodging his friend and roommate Richard, Elena moves in with Fran√ßois, who is overwhelmed by the situation, but the two quickly become friends. Christine is not fooled and plays the situation for all it is worth, making her husband jealous of Fran√ßois and Elena's living situation. √âmilie, too, is confused and upset to see Fran√ßois and Elena together. Eventually, Elena explains the situation to √âmilie, who is grateful for the funding Fran√ßois requested for her, and she acquires a newfound respect for him and eventually accepts Fran√ßois' proposal. In the meantime, Christine secretly tape records Pierre saying he has no intention of leaving her for Elena and offering to take his wife on a second honeymoon. When she sends the tape to Elena, Elena decides to leave Pierre. She notifies Pierre of her leaving by sending Fran√ßois to meet him in her car at a secret rendezvous point. Fran√ßois conveys the news to Pierre who angrily responds that he has voided the 20 million euro transfer. Fran√ßois then tells Pierre that Elena anticipated this of him and indicates that she never wanted the money implying that Elena leaves the relationship with a clean split. Fran√ßois then walks away from the limo as a cross-dressing prostitute approaches Pierre and the two are photographed by a paparazzo.

The film also makes a reference to The Dinner Game during a scene in the movie. Fran√ßois gives his dad, Andr√©, a corkscrew as a birthday present. Andr√© then mentions that he has even been invited to dinner to talk about his passion and collection of corkscrews. The film was shot on location in Boulogne-Billancourt, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and Puteaux, all located in the d√©partement of Hauts-de-Seine. Critical reception Stephen Holden of the New York Times called the film \\"a delectable comedy\\" and added, \\"Francis Veber ... is a master of the modern French farce. And this film has the same tight structure and carefully plotted surprises and reversals as his earlier comedies The Dinner Game and The Closet. These movies are wonderfully frothy contrivances, built with traditional machinery from models that have been around for centuries ... Because its structure and the targets of its satire‚Äîvanity, greed and lust‚Äîhark back to Moli√®re, The Valet offers a reassuring vision of a fixed social order, bourgeois to the core, in which virtue is rewarded and hubris exposed.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle called it \\"an enjoyable farce, with lots of laughs and a strong cast.\\" He observed, \\"At 80 minutes long, it's that rare case of a short film that should have been longer. And that's its problem: It really should have been longer. This is not just a matter of wishing the pleasure might have been extended. The comparative shortness is indicative, rather, of the movie's sole flaw: Veber doesn't know how to end his movie. True, he knows how the audience would like the story to resolve, and he does get there. But he doesn't find a mechanically interesting way to do it. After putting this wonderful machinery in place, he more or less just pulls the plug. He ties things up quickly with a couple of pleasant but lackluster scenes and gets out, leaving the movie feeling truncated. Fine. If he couldn't come up with a great ending, at least he didn't belabor it, and along the way The Valet is a total pleasure.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"Making people laugh is the specialty of the house where French writer-director Francis Veber is concerned, and he is awfully good at it. A complete master of cinematic farce, Veber's latest venture ... makes creating deliciously funny comedy look a lot easier than it has any right to ... While some of the sight gags on view in The Valet have roots that go back to the great silent clowns, Veber's innate understanding of what makes people laugh, his gift for impeccable timing and for getting his cast to work together like interlocking parts of a fine machine, are difficult to resist.\\" Lisa Nesselson of Variety said, \\"Even though you can hear the clockwork mechanism ticking, comic craftsman Francis Veber ... has tooled another bigscreen timepiece with a fun premise and satisfying quotient of laughs.\\" Box office The film was released in France and Belgium on March 20, 2006. It was shown at the Moscow Film Festival, the Vancouver International Film Festival, ShoWest, and the Cleveland International Film Festival before going into limited release in the US on April 20, 2007. The film eventually grossed $1,926,800 in the US and $27,400,068 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $29,326,868. Accolades Dany Boon was nominated for the C√©sar Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Alice Taglioni won the NRJ Cin√© Award for Actress of the Year. Remakes The film was remade in Hindi as Do Knot Disturb in 2009, starring Govinda, Sushmita Sen, Riteish Deshmukh, Lara Dutta. Do Knot Disturb later inspired the 2014 Punjabi movie Disco Singh and the 2016 Bengali moivie Haripad Bandwala. An English-language remake of The Valet has long been in the works. DreamWorks bought the rights to an English-language remake soon after the film's release in 2006, with the Farrelly Brothers attached to direct and Allan Loeb attached as the writer and executive producer. However, nothing came of this project. In 2014 Eugenio Derbez gained the rights to a remake. In 2018 Rob Greenberg and Bob Fisher were hired to write and direct the film, which is planned to star Derbez.

It was maintained throughout the conflict, in spite of several German air raids by aircraft that missed their intended British targets and attacks on Ireland's shipping fleet by Allies and Axis alike. De Valera refrained from joining either the Allies or Axis powers. While the possibilities of not only a German but also a British invasion were discussed in the D√°il, and either eventuality was prepared for, with the most detailed preparations being done in tandem with the Allies under Plan W, De Valera's ruling party, Fianna F√°il, supported his neutral policy for the duration of the war. This period is known in the Republic of Ireland as \\"the Emergency\\", owing to the wording of the constitutional article employed to suspend normal government of the country. Pursuing a policy of neutrality required attaining a balance between the strict observance of non-alignment and the taking of practical steps to repel or discourage an invasion from either of the two concerned parties. Despite the official position of neutrality, there were many unpublicised contraventions of this, such as permitting the use of the Donegal Corridor to Allied military aircraft, and extensive co-operation between Allied and Irish intelligence, including exchanges of information, such as detailed weather reports of the Atlantic Ocean. For example, the decision to go ahead with the Normandy landings was decided by a weather report from Blacksod Bay, County Mayo.See Duggan p.180 Duggan, John P. Herr Hempel at the German Legation in Dublin 1937‚Äì1945 (Irish Academic Press) 2003 Prewar relationship with Britain Ireland was in 1939 nominally a Dominion of the British Empire and a member of the Commonwealth. The nation had gained de facto independence from Britain after the Irish War of Independence, and the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 declared Ireland to be a 'sovereign, independent, democratic state'. A new constitution was adopted by a plebiscite in 1937. The Statute of Westminster 1931 meant that unlike in World War I, Britain's entry into the war no longer automatically included its dominions. Relations between Ireland and Britain had been strained for many years; until 1938, for example, the two states had engaged in the Anglo-Irish Trade War. Nevertheless, Ireland did not sever its vestigial connection with the Crown and it was not until the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 that the final nominal link was severed. No representatives of the new state attended Commonwealth conferences or participated in its affairs, but Ireland remained a legal member until the British Ireland Act 1949, which accepted the declaration of a Republic and formally terminated its membership in the Commonwealth. Alongside George VI's few remaining powers, the 1937 Constitution had provided that the holder of the new office of President of Ireland was in \\"supreme command of the Defence Forces\\".Constitution of Ireland, Article 13.4 ‚Äì \\"The supreme command of the Defence Forces is hereby vested in the President.\\" Internal affairs Irish neutrality was supported by the population of Ireland.O'Halpin, Eunan, 1999, Defending Ireland: The Irish State and its enemies since 1922, Oxford: The Oxford University Press. p. 151 Irish citizens could serve in the British armed forces, as at least 50,000 in the British Army did, as well as in the Merchant Navy and Royal Air Force, with some rising up the ranks rapidly, such as the youngest wing commander fighter ace in the RAF's history: Brendan Finucane. 4,983 members of the Defence Forces deserted to fight with the British and Allied armed forces. After the war, they faced discrimination, lost their rights to pensions and were barred from holding government jobs. They were finally formally pardoned by the Irish Government in 2013. Travel passes and identity cards were also issued to 245,000 people to enable them to travel to Britain to work. Elements of the Irish Republican movement sided with the Third Reich at the onset of the war with the United Kingdom in 1939, believing that a German victory might bring about a United Ireland. In response to accusations that the state had failed to take up the moral fight against Nazism, the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs, Joe Walshe, said in 1941 that:Collins, M.E., 1993, Ireland 1868-1966, Dublin: the Educational Company of Ireland. p. 371 On 1 September 1939, in response to the German invasion of Poland, a hastily convened D√°il declared an immediate state of emergency. The Emergency Powers Act that the day's debate culminated in came into effect one day later, on 3 September. It was modelled extensively on the British draft worked out during the Sudeten crisis a year before. In some respects, the Irish act was regarded as more drastic. The key provisions were as follows:Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.., p 122 With such sweeping executive powers, de Valera's cabinet set out to tackle any problems that might arise and curb any inconsistencies with the nation's policy of neutrality. Censorship of radio newscasts meant newsreaders were confined to reading, without comment, the dispatches of each side, while weather forecasts were halted to preclude the inadvertent assistance of planes or ships involved in the war. Public expressions of opinion appearing to favour one side or the other were usually repressed. The word \\"war\\" itself was avoided, with the Government referring to the situation in Europe from 1939 to 1945 as \\"The Emergency\\". However, on the British declaration of war, the teenaged George Cole watched as an effigy of Neville Chamberlain was publicly burnt in Dublin without any interference by the police. Cole sensed that there was:Cole G. and Hawkins B; The world was my lobster, John Blake Publishing (2013) chapter 2. Social and economic conditions in the state at this time were harsh. Wages stagnated, but prices rose. There were serious shortages of fuel and some foodstuffs. Meanwhile, cross-border smuggling and the black market underwent something of a boom.Bryce Evans, Ireland during the Second World War: Farewell to Plato's Cave (Manchester University Press, 2014) President Douglas Hyde was of the Church of Ireland, most of whose members were ex-unionists and pro-British. When he was invited to a 1943 wedding to be attended by many of the former Protestant Ascendancy, his secretary received assurances from the bride that there would be no \\"pro-belligerent demonstration either by toasting the King of England and/or the singing of the British National Anthem\\". =Prelude to War= The Irish government had good reason to be concerned, lest the war in Europe re-open the wounds of the Civil War. There were pro- and anti-fascist movements in Ireland, and the IRA continued to pursue its own agenda. Former Old IRA commander and founder of the Fine Gael Party General Eoin O'Duffy became a leader of the fascist Blueshirt organisation in 1932‚Äì33.IRISH SECRETS: GERMAN ESPIONAGE IN WARTIME IRELAND, 1939‚Äì1945 In recognition of his consistent support for Ireland's Jews, √âamon de Valera, Ireland's Taoiseach during the war, has a forest in Israel named in his honour. In this context, it is relevant to note that two Irish contingents fought in the 1937 Spanish Civil Warbut on opposing sides. O'Duffy's Irish Brigade fought with the (Fascist) Nationalists and the Irish contingent of the International Brigades fought with the Republicans, though neither had government support. In the six months prior to the onset of war, there had been an escalation of Irish Republican Army violence and a bombing campaign in Britain under the new leadership of Se√°n Russell. De Valera, who had tolerated the IRA as recently as 1936, responded with the Offences against the State Act, 1939. Upon the outbreak of the main conflict in September, subversive activity was regarded as endangering the security of the state. There were fears that the United Kingdom, eager to secure Irish ports for their air and naval forces, might use the attacks as a pretext for an invasion of Ireland and a forcible seizure of the assets in question. Furthermore, the possibility that the IRA (in line with the Irish republican tradition of courting allies in Europe) might link up with German agents, thereby compromising Irish non-involvement, was considered. This threat was real: Russell, in May 1940, travelled to Berlin in an effort to obtain arms and support for the IRA. He received training in German ordnance, but died on a submarine while returning to Ireland as part of Operation Dove.Se√°n Cronin: Frank Ryan, The Search for the Republic, Repsol, 1980. pp. 188‚Äì190 A small number of inadequately prepared German agents were sent to Ireland, but those who did arrive were quickly picked up by the Directorate of Military Intelligence (G2). Active republicans were interned at the Curragh or given prison sentences: six men were hanged under newly legislated acts of treason and three more died on hunger strike.Collins, M.E., 1993, Ireland 1868-1966, Dublin: the Educational Company of Ireland. p. 373 The Germans also later came to realise they had overestimated the abilities of the IRA. By 1943, the IRA had all but ceased to exist. In Ireland, neutrality was popular, despite rationing and economic pressure.The Earl of Longford and Thomas P. O'Neill: √âamon de Valera. Gill and MacMillan, Dublin, 1970. pp. 347‚Äì355 =Ports and Trade= At the outbreak of the war, Ireland was isolated as never before. Shipping had been neglected since independence.McIvor, page 16 Foreign ships, on which Ireland had hitherto depended, were less available.Spong, page 11. \\"in the period April 1941 and June 1942, only seven such ships visited the country\\" Neutral American ships would not enter the \\"war zone\\". There were a mere 56 Irish ships when the war started; 15 more were purchased or leased during the conflict; 20 were lost. In his Saint Patrick's Day address in 1940, Taoiseach √âamon de Valera, lamented: The diminutive Irish Mercantile Marine continued essential overseas trading. This period was referred to as \\"The Long Watch\\" by Irish mariners. They sailed unarmed and usually alone, flying the Irish tricolour. They identified themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks,Fisk, page 273, \\"Up to four huge tricolours were painted on the sides of each ship together with the word EIRE in letters twenty feet high\\" yet twenty percent of seamen perished in a war in which they were non-participants. Allied convoys often could not stop to pick up survivors. Irish ships always answered SOS calls; they always stopped to rescue. Irish mariners rescued seafarers from both sides, but they were attacked by both, predominantly by the Axis powers. Vital imports arrived. Exports, mainly food supplies for Great Britain, were delivered. 521 lives were saved.Fisk, page 276 Many British ships were repaired in Irish shipyards. Despite being frequently encountered as rumours, no U-boats ever used Ireland as a refuelling base. The origins of this claim likely originates with the 1939 dumping of 28 rescued Greek sailors by onto the Irish coast, after the U-boat commander Werner Lott sank their Greek cargo freighter, which was bound for Britain with metal ore. This U-boat incident was featured on the cover of the popular U.S. Life magazine, on 16 October 1939. As in the days preceding, news of the dumping was widely published, the magazine and the locals who spotted the unloading of the captured Greeks noted that the U-boat had conducted the action and re- submerged before coastal defence aircraft could be directed onto the trespassing vessel.  External affairs  =Policy= For de Valera the emphasis of Irish neutrality was on preservation of Irish sovereignty, so committing to the policy accomplished both rational and ideological goals. While the revolutionaries of the Irish War of Independence were ready to enter into alliances with the enemies of Britain to secure Irish independence, they realised that continuing such a policy after achieving independence would be dangerously provocative, a point de Valera made as early as February 1920:Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.. p. 121 This statement reflected a point de Valera had made as early as 1918 (when writing to President of the United States Woodrow Wilson, seeking that the United States formally recognise the Irish Republic as an independent state): After the Italian conquest of Abyssinia in 1936, de Valera said at the League of Nations: Months before the outbreak of war, de Valera gave a statement to the Associated Press which appeared in newspapers on 20 February 1939:D√°il Debates, 22 March 1939. =Offer to end the Partition of Ireland in 1940= At a series of meetings in 17‚Äì26 June 1940, during and after the Battle of France, British envoy Malcolm MacDonald brought a proposal to end the partition of Ireland and offered a solemn undertaking to accept \\"the principle of a United Ireland\\" if the independent Irish state would abandon its neutrality and immediately join the war against Germany and Italy. However, the reality of unity would have to be agreed by the \\"representatives of the government of √âire and the government of Northern Ireland\\", each of which distrusted the other intensely. De Valera therefore rejected the amended proposals on 4 July, worried that there was \\"no guarantee that in the end we would have a united Ireland\\" and that it \\"would commit us definitely to an immediate abandonment of our neutrality\\". De Valera had campaigned against partition and the 1937 Constitution drafted by him had an irredentist clause describing the State as the \\"whole island of Ireland\\". After the war he again called repeatedly for the ending of partition. The offer and his rejection remained secret until a biography was published in 1970.Longford, Earl of & O'Neill, T.P. √âamon de Valera (Hutchinson 1970; Arrow paperback 1974) Arrow pp.365‚Äì368. =Mixed effects= In April 1941, the question of Ireland's entry into the war was again raised when the Australian Prime Minister Menzies paid a visit to Belfast and Dublin for private discussions with De Valera and John M. Andrews, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Subsequently, Menzies reported to Churchill that the complexity of the questions of Irish unity and sovereignty meant that there was little possibility of Ireland's abandoning its policy of neutrality. Without the Irish treaty ports (which the United Kingdom had released a year prior to the war), an independent Ireland posed a serious disadvantage to the military capability and safety of British fighting and trade, risking the possibility of invasion if that disadvantage ever proved too great. If Irish sovereignty was to be maintained, then neutrality would have to be steered consciously to the benefit of British interests, as these were its own: at once to aid the British war effort but also to forestall invasion by Britain to regain the treaty ports. Ireland, like other neutrals was '...neutral for the power that potentially threatened them most.' Lee, J.J., 1989, Ireland 1912‚Äì1985, Cambridge: University of Cambridge. p. 244 During the war, and accusing de Valera as a 'Nazi sympathiser', the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Craigavon, urged Churchill to use Scottish and Welsh troops to overrun 'southern Ireland' before installing a Governor- General for the whole island at Dublin, but this proposal was rejected by London. Nevertheless, Churchill directed Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery to prepare plans to seize Cork and Queenstown (Cobh) so their harbours could be used as naval bases. Better submarine-detecting technology, as well as military bases in Iceland, meant that the Irish ports were no longer as vital for the Allies as they had been during World War I. In this regard Viscount Cranborne acknowledged at the war's end that the Irish Government had '...been willing to accord us any facilities which would not be regarded as overtly prejudicing their attitude to neutrality', collaborating with the British war cabinet.Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.. p. 124-5 (See below for complete text.) The pattern of co-operation between British and Irish agencies began upon the onset of war when de Valera permitted the use of specified Irish airspace mainly for patrolling coastal points. The use of the \\"Donegal Corridor\\", the narrow strip of Irish territory between County Fermanagh and the sea, was significant. By the autumn of 1941 use of the corridor was a daily routine. While de Valera rejected British appeals to use Irish ports and harbour facilities directly, de Valera was, according to M.E. Collins, 'more friendly than strict neutrality should have allowed.'Collins, M.E., 1993, Ireland 1868-1966, Dublin: the Educational Company of Ireland, pg. 374 The co-operation that emerged allowed for meetings to take place to consider events after German troops had overrun neutral Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands Luxembourg and Belgium. Three days after the fall of France, Irish and British defence officials met to discuss how British troops could, strictly at de Valera's invitation, occupy Ireland upon the event of a German landing there to expel foreign troops attempting to use her as a back door to later invade Britain (Plan \\"W\\"). The meetings continued, as Cranborne described, throughout the war, facilitating further dialogue. Before the war began, de Valera had held a meeting with career diplomat Dr. Eduard Hempel, the German Minister in Ireland since 1938. The meetings discussed Ireland's close trade links with the United Kingdom and the ease with which Britain could invade her if its interests were threatened. He, in turn, communicated to Berlin that such was the case that it 'rendered it inevitable for the Irish government to show a certain consideration for Britain' and urged war officials to avoid any action that would legitimise a British invasion of Ireland. In mid-June 1940, Secretary of External Affairs Joe Walshe expressed his 'great admiration for the German achievements.' Hempel, for his part, wrote to Germany of 'the great and decisive importance, even to Ireland, of the changed situation in world affairs and of the obvious weakness of the democracies.' Hempel might well have known better of Irish intentions, having earlier described a native custom 'to say agreeable things without meaning everything that is said.' Other examples of Irish attitudes towards Nazi Germany found expression in mid-1940 in de Valera's Charg√© d'Affaires in Berlin, William Warnock, 'whose \\"unquestionable\\" hostility to Britain could easily be interpreted as sympathetic for National Socialism.'Lee, J.J., 1989, Ireland 1912‚Äì1985, Cambridge: University of Cambridge, pg. 248 Academic J.J. Lee questioned just how much of Warnock's zeal towards Hitler's Reichstag speech on 19 July was genuine enthusiasm for the 'international justice' that could be expected after Germany's victory, as opposed to an adherence to the instructions of Dublin to please oneself to the potential victors. Three years later, by 1944, the orientation of the war and of Irish relations to Germany had turned about-face, with the likelihood of a German victory now remote. In that climate, the Irish Government, once so ready to 'say agreeable things', Hempel remarked, had become 'unhelpful and evasive'.Lee, J.J., 1989, Ireland 1912‚Äì1985, Cambridge: University of Cambridge, pg. 253 The United States Ambassador to Ireland, David Gray, stated that he once asked de Valera what he would do if German paratroopers \\"liberated Derry\\". According to Gray, de Valera was silent for a time and then replied \\"I don't know\\". =Condolences on Hitler's death= Ireland maintained a public stance of neutrality to the end, by refusing to close the German and Japanese Legations, and the Taoiseach √âamon de Valera signed the book of condolence on Adolf Hitler's death on 2 May 1945, and personally visited Ambassador Hempel, following the usual protocol on the death of a Head of State of a state with a legation in Ireland. President Hyde visited Hempel separately on 3 May. The visits caused a storm of protest in the United States. Irish envoys in other nations did likewise, but no other Western European democracies followed Ireland's example. De Valera denounced reports of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as \\"anti-national propaganda\\"; according to Paul Bew, this was not out of disbelief but rather because the Holocaust undermined the assumptions underlying Irish neutrality: moral equivalence between the Allies and the Axis, and the idea that the Irish were the most persecuted people in Europe. =Position on Jewish refugees= Ireland's position on Jewish refugees fleeing Europe was sceptical. Irish authorities during the war generally gave two justifications for turning away prospective immigrants: that they would overcrowd the nation and take Irish jobs, and that the presence of a large Jewish population would inflame anti- Semitic sentiments amongst the Irish.Section on Clonyn Castle in Holocaust Memorial Day 2003 Program Booklet, January 2003, Holocaust Memorial Day. Dublin: The Holocaust Memorial Day Committee in association with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Dublin City Council http://hetireland.org/app/uploads/2015/02/HMD2003.pdf accessed 2015-09-27 There was some domestic anti-Jewish sentiment during World War II, most notably expressed in a notorious speech to the D√°il in 1943, when newly elected independent TD Oliver J. Flanagan advocated \\"routing the Jews out of the country\\".D√°il √âireann - Volume 91 - 9 July 1943 ‚Äì antisemitic speech to the D√°il by Oliver J. Flanagan There was some official indifference from the political establishment to the Jewish victims of the Holocaust during and after the war. This indifference would later be described by Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell as being \\"antipathetic, hostile and unfeeling\\".Republic of Ireland ‚Äì Stephen Roth Institute Dr. Mervyn O'Driscoll of University College Cork reported on the unofficial and official barriers that prevented Jews from finding refuge in Ireland, although the barriers have been down ever since: Ireland: Britain's last Redoubt? In his book Wings over Ireland ‚Äì History of the Irish Air Corps, Donal McCarron gives extensive details on the otherwise secret Rathduff aerodrome. He states that as early as the summer of 1940 both governments were worried about the \\"Doomsday scenario\\" of a successful invasion of Britain. The RAF would need at least one aerodrome to continue the fight in Ireland and both the Irish and British armies secretly scouted for a site in the south of Ireland. The other airfields of Rineanna near Limerick and Dublin Airport and Baldonnel near Dublin would cover other parts of Ireland, so the RAF was keen on a site near the southeast coast. The Irish Army disagreed, fearing a German invasion would overrun it quickly, so both finally agreed on a site in the south of County Tipperary, in the valley of the river Suir, east of the Galtee Mountains. This also suited the Irish Army as they had built a secret command headquarters near a convent school seven miles away to be used in case of invasion. The name \\"Rathduff\\" was chosen as a cover because such a name is to be found all over Munster. Both sites were completely out of bounds for all normal military operations. With Hitler turning towards the USSR in 1941 the chances of an invasion of Britain waned and the Irish Army decided to hold a major exercise to test the planning and training it had been undertaking for four years, in autumn 1942. As part of this, \\"Rathduff's\\" secret was partially released, with it serving as the airfield for Ireland's 2nd Division during the exercise. After the exercises \\"Rathduff\\" slipped into obscurity, its fields returning to use as the thoroughbred stud farm they had been before.  Victory in Europe Day  In his speech celebrating the Allied victory in Europe (13 May 1945) Winston Churchill remarked that he had demonstrated restraint towards Ireland because > 'we never laid a violent hand upon them, which at times would have been > quite easy and quite natural.' Britain had occupied neutral Iceland in May 1940. In a response a few days later, de Valera acknowledged that Churchill did not add 'another horrid chapter to the already bloodstained record' of British-Irish relations, but asked:Collins, M.E., 1993, Ireland 1868-1966, Dublin: the Educational Company of Ireland, pg. 383Clair Wills, 2007, That Neutral Island: A Cultural History of Ireland During the Second World War In addition, he put the following, that The implications on Victory in Europe Day and after, of having not been involved in the war and having suffered the devastation that defined the course of Europe afterwards, is the subject of historical debate. The devastation shared by most of Europe, and Ireland's avoidance of it, was described by F.S.L. Lyons as: In response to which R. Fanning wrote: 'One might question [...] the liberating value of war for a people who has so recently emerged from revolution followed by a civil war and in whose midst the IRA still propounded the creed of violence ...'Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.., p. 127  The Cranborne Report  Viscount Cranborne, the British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, wrote a letter on 21 February 1945 to the British War Cabinet regarding Irish- British collaboration during 1939‚Äì1945:Fanning, R., 1983, Independent Ireland, Dublin: Helicon, Ltd.., pp 124‚Äì5 Effect on United Nations membership The neutrality policy led to a considerable delay in Ireland's membership of the United Nations (UN). Ireland's applications for membership were vetoed by the Soviet Union, a permanent member of the Security Council, from 1946 to December 1955.Elizabeth Keane ‚Äì An Irish Statesman and Revolutionary: the nationalist and internationalist politics of Sean MacBride ‚Äì London: I.B.Tauris Publishers \\"The Soviet Union vetoed the application's entry ostensibly on the grounds that Ireland had no diplomatic presence in the Soviet Union and that during the war, Ireland did not help the Allies, instead offering support to the Axis and Franco's Spain. Ireland's anti-communist stance was probably more responsible; the membership of the General Assembly was weighted towards the Western Bloc, and the Soviet Union did not want its position in the Assembly weakened.\\" (page 150) The original use of the term \\"United Nations\\" in 1942‚Äì45 always referred to the Allies of World War II. Ireland had applied to join the UN in 1946, following the demise of the League of Nations, where Irish diplomat Se√°n Lester was the last Secretary-General. By March 1955, the Minister for External Affairs, Liam Cosgrave, announced that: ‚ÄúIreland's application for membership of the U.N.O. still stands although it remains blocked by an objection in the Security Council.‚Äù For reasons of diplomacy the government would not state the reason for the objection, nor which country had made it. Sean MacBride considered that the UN boycott of Ireland was originally agreed at the 1945 Yalta Conference by Churchill and Stalin. This seems unlikely, given that Yalta was held a year before Ireland's application to join the UN, and was based on press speculation. Ireland's acceptance into the UN was announced by John A. Costello on 15 December 1955.

Key thinkers on space and place. pp. 47‚Äì51.Short bio Brian J Berry at University of Texas in Dallas. Accessed Nov 20, 2009.  Biography  Berry was born in Sedgley, Staffordshire, United Kingdom. He was educated at Queen Elizabeth's High School, Gainsborough, Lincolnshire and Acton County Grammar School, Acton, Middlesex, now the Ark Acton Academy. He graduated from University College, London, with a B.Sc. (Economics) degree with first class honors in 1955. With a Fulbright scholarship he went on to the University of Washington where he completed an M.A. in 1956, and a Ph.D. in 1958, studying under noted geographer and leader of the \\"quantitative revolution\\" William Garrison in the Department of Geography. Upon completing his Ph.D., Berry was appointed to the faculty at the University of Chicago, rising to the position of Irving B.Harris Professor of Urban Geography, geography department chair and director of the Center for Urban Studies, positions that he held until 1976. During this time his urban and regional research sparked geography‚Äôs social- scientific revolution and made him the most-cited geographer for more than 25 years, known for his refinement of central place theory and for laying the foundations of analytic urban geography, of spatial analysis, and of geospatial information science. In 1965 he acquired dual US-UK citizenship. Since 1990 his studies have focused on long-wave theory and its relationships to macrohistorical phasing of economic development and political behavior. He also has researched variations in the quality of life (\\"happiness\\") across and within nations. From 1976 to 1981 Berry was the Frank Backus Williams Professor of City and Regional Planning in the Graduate School of Design, chair of the PhD Program in Urban Planning and professor in sociology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, director of the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and Spatial Analysis and a faculty fellow of the Institute for International Development at Harvard, and following that was appointed University Professor of Urban Studies and Public Policy and dean of the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University for a period of 5 years. In 1986 he joined the University of Texas at Dallas, occupying the Lloyd Viel Berkner Regental Professorship, and becoming founding dean of the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences. He has remained active there since. Among his honors, Berry was elected a member the National Academy of Sciences in 1975 and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. He is also a Fellow of the British Academy and University College, London. He was the 1978-79 President of the Association of American Geographere, and among many other awards and recognitions, in 1988 he was awarded the Victoria Medal from the Royal Geographical Society. In 1999 he was elected a member of the Council of the National Academy of Sciences, and in 2004 was a founding member of the Texas Academy of Medicine, Engineering and Science (TAMEST), later serving on its council. In 2005 he was named the Laureat Internationale de Geographie 'Vautrin Lud' (the 'Nobel Prize of Geography') and became a Fellow on the American Institute of Certified Planners, followed thereafter by Fellowship in the Regional Science Association International. In 2017 the International N.D. Kondratieff Foundation named him a Kondratieff Medal Laureate and in 2020, still active, the American Association of Geographers gave him the Stan Brunn Award for Scholarly Creativity.  Publications  Berry has authored over 550 books and articles, and attempts to bridge theory and practice via involvement in urban and regional development activities in both advanced and developing countries. During his career he also has been advisor to more than 150 new PhDs and has served on an equal number of other doctoral committees. Many of his students have gone on to successful academic and professional careers in their own right. He also has been an active family historian and genealogist, with many additional publications to his name, most recently delving into genetic genealogy, where testing by FamilyTreeDNA documents his y-Dna to be the Bell-Beaker R-L21>A5846>A5840>A5835>Y18815>Y42681, which he shares with descendants of John Berry of Honley in Yorkshire (1510-1569), and his mitochondrial DNA to be T2f1a1.

Originally designed for use with the revised 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons, they transitioned to the first edition of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game in 2009, then to the second edition of Pathfinder in 2019. Three lines of supplements are produced as of August 2019: *Pathfinder Adventure Path *Pathfinder Adventures *Pathfinder World Guide One previous line, Pathfinder Player Companion, has been discontinued. Business model All Pathfinder books are published under the terms of the Open Game License (OGL). While the magazines Dragon and Dungeon were both licensed to make use of certain iconic elements of Dungeons & Dragons intellectual property, including material drawn from official settings published by Wizards of the Coast and unique monsters such as illithids, the terms of the OGL forbid the use of such \\"closed\\" IP elements. Conversely, however, OGL material from other roleplaying game publishers (such as Necromancer Games or Green Ronin Publishing) can be used in Pathfinder, whereas the terms of Paizo's license with Wizards of the Coast had prevented them from using any third-party OGL material in Dragon or Dungeon. The Pathfinder product lines use a subscription business model, in addition to being sold in book stores, game stores, and online retailers. All of the subscriptions are ongoing, and can be canceled at any time, rather than being initially purchased for a set length of time as many magazine subscriptions are. Each Pathfinder product is published in both print and PDF. Product lines =Pathfinder Adventure Path= Paizo Publishing's main Pathfinder product line is its Adventure Paths. A continuation of the concept from Dungeon magazine, which moved to online publication in September 2007, each year's worth of Pathfinder Adventure Path publishes two complete adventure paths in six-issue arcs, with supplementary articles to fill out each 96-page issue. It is under the editorial supervision of James Jacobs, formerly editor-in-chief of Dungeon. \\"The Pathfinder's Journal\\" was a short (6-8 page) fiction section that appeared in early issues. Paizo has published a number of adventure paths, including \\"Rise of the Runelords\\", \\"Curse of the Crimson Throne\\", \\"Second Darkness\\", and \\"Legacy of Fire\\". The \\"Council of Thieves\\" Adventure Path is the first to use the rules of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. Beginning with the 145th issue, the start of the Age of Ashes Adventure Path, the series transitioned to the second edition of the Pathfinder RPG rules. =Pathfinder Adventures= Pathfinder Adventures are stand-alone adventure modules. Each module is a 32-page softcover containing a single adventure and one or more new monsters. Each module also includes ready-to-play characters of the appropriate level for the adventure. Pathfinder Adventures were originally called GameMastery Modules. The name was changed to Pathfinder Modules in June 2008 to bring it in line with the rest of the Pathfinder line. It took its current name with the launch of the second edition of the rules. Pathfinder Adventures is a quarterly publication. =Pathfinder World Guide= Pathfinder World Guide products, originally known as Pathfinder Chronicles then as the Pathfinder Campaign Setting line, are additional materials designed to explore the fictional world of Golarion during the \\"Age of Lost Omens\\", the setting of the Adventure Path and Module lines. The world has civilizations and nations inspired by those of Earth's real history and expands beyond the fictional tropes and literary references related to western civilization found in the works of mid-20th century authors like Tolkien or Lewis, adding elements from African mythology, Asian mythology or Middle East medieval fiction. Originally consisting of 32-page softcovers published bimonthly with occasional hardcover releases, with the transition to the second edition of the Pathfinder RPG, the line took its current name and moved to a publishing schedule of larger, less frequent hardcover books. =Pathfinder Player Companion= Pathfinder Player Companion were 32-page softcover books released monthly. The line was targeted at players as opposed to game masters; each issue contains details on the fictional civilizations, races and organizations which populate the world of Golarion. Originally published bimonthly, beginning August 2012 the Player Companion became monthly. The line was discontinued following the release of the June 2019 issue, with it being merged with the World Guide line.

It is 50 miles south of Pittsburgh, just a few miles from the Donegal exit on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, located at the intersection of route 711 and route 130. Gas station in Stahlstown.  History  The village was originally known as Centerville, but the name was changed after the Post Office objected there already being a town of Centerville nearby across Laurel Hill in Somerset County. It was then decided to name the town Stahlstown after Leonard Stahl (b. 1734 ‚Äì d. Nov.1829) upon whose land the village was built. Leonard Stahl was married to Elizabeth King (daughter of Michael and Susanna [Passmore] King of Somerset County). Elizabeth's brother William King (b. Nov 23, 1776 ‚Äì d. May 5, 1853) was also instrumental in the founding of Stahlstown along with another brother, Enos King (b. Oct 28, 1768 ‚Äì d. Aug 15, 1845), who built the first house in the village near the intersection of route 711 and route 130. The house was built of stone around the year 1799 and in 1882 was occupied by John Roadman (b. March 1821 ‚Äì d. Mar 29, 1902), son of Jacob and Ann (King) Roadman. Ann King was William's oldest child. The house is still occupied today. At one time the small village had as many as three gas stations, a general store, a pub, post office, firehouse, and a Nickelodeon movie theater. The Stahlstown Flax Scutching Grounds is home to the nations second oldest continued Flax Scutching Festival , held annually in the month of September. A popular event for locals and tourists is the \\"Indian Raid\\" which is a historical recreation of a typical gun battle between Native American's and American pioneer's that culminates with the burning of mock cabin and ends in a smoky gun battle. In 2007, the festival celebrated its 100th anniversary.A young boy on horseback, recreating the Indian Raid during the Flax Scutching Festival, September 1960. According to the Chestnut Ridge Historical Society, a farmhouse just outside Stahlstown was used during World War II by the German American Bund as the headquarters to the largest German spy ring in the eastern United States, with connecting offices in Chicago and New York. Residents of the farmhouse were directly on Adolf Hitler's payroll and used the facility to direct and gather information, and place workers in factories, shipyards and even the armed forces. After the war, Hitler planned to build a house in woods of Pennsylvania because of its resemblance to the Black Forest of southwest Germany. In the 1980s and 1990s Stahlstown was home to North America's only importer for Bimota motorcycles from Rimini, Italy. This exotic sport bike would attract customers from all over the country, including celebrities like Jay Leno. During the second week of July the Chestnut Ridge Community Volunteer Fire Company hosts a week-long fair complete with amusement rides, entertainment, a parade and a Saturday evening display of Zambelli Fireworks. A unique aspect to the small village, State Route 130 is the division between Mount Pleasant Area School District and Ligonier Valley School District. This has allowed some parents a \\"gray area\\" as to which school district they are to send their children.

Mujahideen forces ambushed the Soviet force in Maravar Gorge, cutting off its 1st company and inflicting heavy casualties. As Russian reinforcements arrived, the mujahideen covered the civilian evacuation of the gorge and successfully carried out a fighting withdrawal.  Advance  On March 27, 1985, less than one month before the operation, the 334th Separate Special Purpose Group (OO SpN) was transferred to Asadabad, Province Kunar, Afghanistan from Mariansky Gorki, Belorussian Military District, USSR. On April 20, 1985, at 10:00 p.m., the group deployed from their home base Asadabad on foot, crossing the river Kunar by ferry, having received orders to investigate the settlement of Sangam located in Maravar Gorge, a mere from the unit‚Äôs quarters. There was a report that a mujahideen observation post with 8‚Äì10 people had been spotted in Sangam. The unit‚Äôs commanders planned the operation as a large-scale training exercise. The plan was to have the 1st Company advance toward the settlement through the narrow gorge's floor while the 2nd and 3rd Companies were to cover their advance from the ridges framing the gorge. The 1st Company entered Sangam by 5:00am and searched the settlement. There were no opposition forces in the village, but two mujahideen were spotted retreating further into the gorge. From his command post located near the entrance of the gorge the 334th detachment commander, Major Terentyev, ordered the capture or neutralization of the enemy. The 1st Company commander, Captain Tsebruk, divided his men into 4 platoons and began advancing towards the Daridam settlement located deeper into the gorge. The groups were moving on both sides of the gorge‚Äôs bottom without any flank cover from the ridges. Only the commander of the 3rd Company had a full view of Daridam, from his position atop the ridge above Sangam, and so was the only person able to report the unfolding events to Major Terentyev. First to encounter hostile combatants was Lieutenant Nikolai Kuznetsov‚Äôs platoon. Immediately, Captain Tsebruk set out toward the shooting accompanied by 4 riflemen. He left his radio operator and the platoon he had led behind to occupy an elevated terrace. It is believed that at this point Captain Tsebruk grasped the situation and attempted to remedy the situation, but was mortally wounded in the throat and died. At this point Major Terentyev lost his control over the flow of the battle. The trap snapped shut behind the 1st Company: using the buses the enemy was able to circle to the rear of the 1st Company and block their retreat. On the flanks, mujahideen heavy machine guns were emplaced on both ridges to cover the elevated approaches to Daridam; they effectively blocked the 2nd and 3rd Companies from advancing to assist the 1st Company. Left on their own, the 1st Company personnel took firing positions wherever they could. In desperation, they took cover behind the low mud walls. Some soldiers lit the orange smoke grenades to call for air rescue. The enemy numbers were overwhelming and the Soviet soldiers had only a limited supply of ammunition, which was exhausted within minutes of combat.  Attempted rescue  While the events in the Maravar Gorge were unfolding, the troops remaining at the home base of 334th OO SpN at Asadabad were alerted. Hastily, they began assembling an armored column out of the remaining vehicles. The column was reinforced by the armor detachment of an infantry battalion located nearby. The heavy vehicles could not be loaded onto the local ferry, so the column had to cross Kunar via a ‚Äìdistant bridge, and then drive back toward the Maravar Gorge. The trip between the Asadabad base and Sangam settlement, a distance on the map, turned into a grind across the rugged, mine-seeded Afghan terrain. Only one BMP out of the entire armored column was able to reach Maravar Gorge that morning. It could not alter the fate of the 1st company in Daridam, but it quite possibly had saved the 2nd and 3rd companies, now under intensive attack in Sangam. Later in the afternoon of April 21, the armored column with the supporting infantry reached the Maravar Gorge. They were met by the exhausted survivors carrying the injured. They told a horrid tale of the fate of captured Russians, who were beheaded by the mujahideen.  Aftermath  Later, the Soviet troops were reinforced by 154th OO SpN and the Air Assault Battalion of the 66th Brigade arriving on helicopters from Jalalabad. The 2nd battalion of the 66th Brigade had also marched into the mountains from Asadabad. What was planned as a training raid had grown into a major combat operation involving 4 battalions and frontline aviation units. The mujahideen continued fighting for 2 more days, covering the exodus of the civilian refugees from Sangam and Daridam settlements to Pakistan. Three more soldiers lost their lives during mopping-up operations.  External links  * Vladimir Grigoriev Facts Of The War History.

In his eight-year professional football career, Parrish played in 105 regular season games, recorded a total of 31 interceptions, and returned those interceptions for 557 yards and three touchdowns.  Life after the NFL  During his time with the Browns, Parrish served as team representative to the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), and later NFLPA vice president. After retiring as a player, Parrish worked with the Teamsters in the late 1960s in an unsuccessful attempt to organize a new Teamsters- affiliated NFL/AFL players' union. At the Teamsters, he worked for Harold J. Gibbons, the heir apparent to Jimmy Hoffa.

Norton made his debut for Warwickshire against Leicestershire at Edgbaston at the end of June 1920, making an unbeaten 26 (which was to remain his career best) from number ten in his only innings. Immediately afterwards, he appeared against Sussex at the same venue, but only 58 overs were possible and his only contribution was five wicketless overs for 19 runs. His next first-class appearance was not for almost two years, and when he did play again in June 1922 it was for a very weak Worcestershire side destined to finish bottom of the County Championship. His second game for his new county, against Northamptonshire at Worcester, brought him his first wicket (that of John Howman) and indeed what were to remain his best bowling figures of 3-74. Norton played four more times for Worcestershire, but the county lost them all: indeed, in his eight-match first-class career he was never part of a winning side. His final game was his only appearance of 1923, at Gravesend against Kent, and in an eight-wicket defeat his ten overs went without reward.

The same name may also refer to quantum dot cellular automata, which are a proposed physical implementation of \\"classical\\" cellular automata by exploiting quantum mechanical phenomena. QCA have attracted a lot of attention as a result of its extremely small feature size (at the molecular or even atomic scale) and its ultra-low power consumption, making it one candidate for replacing CMOS technology.  Usage of the term  In the context of models of computation or of physical systems, quantum cellular automaton refers to the merger of elements of both (1) the study of cellular automata in conventional computer science and (2) the study of quantum information processing. In particular, the following are features of models of quantum cellular automata: * The computation is considered to come about by parallel operation of multiple computing devices, or cells. The cells are usually taken to be identical, finite-dimensional quantum systems (e.g. each cell is a qubit). * Each cell has a neighborhood of other cells. Altogether these form a network of cells, which is usually taken to be regular (e.g. the cells are arranged as a lattice with or without periodic boundary conditions). * The evolution of all of the cells has a number of physics-like symmetries. Locality is one: the next state of a cell depends only on its current state and that of its neighbours. Homogeneity is another: the evolution acts the same everywhere, and is independent of time. * The state space of the cells, and the operations performed on them, should be motivated by principles of quantum mechanics. Another feature that is often considered important for a model of quantum cellular automata is that it should be universal for quantum computation (i.e. that it can efficiently simulate quantum Turing machines,.C.

Models which have been proposed recently impose further conditions, e.g. that quantum cellular automata should be reversible and/or locally unitary, and have an easily determined global transition function from the rule for updating individual cells. Recent results show that these properties can be derived axiomatically, from the symmetries of the global evolution.B. Schumacher and R.

See also (quant-ph)  Models  =Early proposals= In 1982, Richard Feynman suggested an initial approach to quantizing a model of cellular automata.R. Feynman, \\"Simulating physics with computers\\", Int. J. Theor. Phys. 21, 1982: pp. 467‚Äì488. In 1985, David Deutsch presented a formal development of the subject.D. Deutsch, \\"Quantum theory, the Church-Turing principle and the universal quantum computer\\" Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A 400 (1985), pp. 97‚Äì117. Later, Gerhard Gr√∂ssing and Anton Zeilinger introduced the term \\"quantum cellular automata\\" to refer to a model they defined in 1988,G. Grossing and A. Zeilinger, \\"Quantum cellular automata\\", Complex Systems 2 (2), 1988: pp. 197‚Äì208 and 611‚Äì623. although their model had very little in common with the concepts developed by Deutsch and so has not been developed significantly as a model of computation. =Models of universal quantum computation= The first formal model of quantum cellular automata to be researched in depth was that introduced by John Watrous. This model was developed further by Wim van Dam,W. van Dam, \\"Quantum cellular automata\\", Master Thesis, Computer Science Nijmegen, Summer 1996. as well as Christoph D√ºrr, Huong L√™Thanh, and Miklos Santha,C.

See also quant-ph/0512040 However it was later realised that this definition was too loose, in the sense that some instances of it allow superluminal signalling. A second wave of models includes those of Susanne Richter and Reinhard Werner,S. Richter and R.F. Werner, \\"Ergodicity of quantum cellular automata\\", J. Stat. Phys. 82, 1996: pp. 963‚Äì998.

These are all closely related, and do not suffer any such locality issue. In the end one can say that they all agree to picture quantum cellular automata as just some large quantum circuit, infinitely repeating across time and space. =Models of physical systems= Models of quantum cellular automata have been proposed by David Meyer,D.

They were one of the first companies to develop network computing products for notebook computers. Products included computer memory cards, LAN adapters, modems, and remote access server products. The company's products enabled notebook users to share information over a network connection. During fiscal 1999, the company introduced 56K modems in the MiniPCI form factor. In September 1999, the company acquired Rex PC Card Organizer product line. During fiscal 2000, the company acquired Omnipoint Technologies, Inc. and Entrega Technologies Inc. Branded products accounted for 65% of fiscal 2000 revenues and OEM products, 35%. In 2001, Intel acquired Xircom and in early 2003 laid off most of Xircom's Thousand Oaks employees.  History  The company was founded in 1988 by Dirk Gates and Kirk Mathews on the premise of delivering modem and ethernet connectivity to mobile computers. The company grew to over 2,000 employees and achieved revenues of $500M and a market cap in excess of $2B. Mobility solutions were based on IEEE 802.11, GPRS, and Bluetooth technologies. Xircom was known as an innovative leader in networking technology, pioneering the world's first wireless networking devices for portable computers, known as Netwave. Xircom's NetWave adapters boasted a raw data rate of 1M bit/sec (blazing fast at the time) and fostered the creation and development of today's WiFi infrastructure and devices, which are virtually everywhere today. Xircom was also equally innovative in its working environment. Employees were encouraged to express their creative natures, fostering a positive and creative environment where new ideas and efficiency flowed as easily as the waterfall in their indoor fish pond, which was originally constructed in front of the Engineering Vice President's cubicle as a joke. Products = Pocket LAN Adapter = In 1988, the only universal connection available on notebook PCs was the printer port, so Xircom devised the Pocket LAN Adapter that attached to the printer port and connected the notebook PC to a network. Xircom then became one of the top providers of networking computing devices. =RealPort= Xircom was renowned for their PC Cards, the most well known of which was the RealPort series designed by boutique start-up ID firm Next Planet. The 32-bit RealPort CardBus Ethernet 10/100+Modem 56 combined 10/100Mbit/s Ethernet, a 56K modem, and even GSM connectivity via an externally connected Mobile Phone, in a single dongle-free Integrated PC Card solution. RealPort family of cards solved the major problem mobile users experienced with PC Cards: lost, forgotten, or broken cable connectors and broken pop-out jacks. By eliminating fragile dongles on the device, the RealPort Integrated PC Cards provided robust and reliable communications by integrating connectors directly into the card. =NetAccess= NetAccess Series Remote Access cards (RAS) included models ISDN, and the world's first multiport modem (MPM-4 and MPM-8). =REX 6000= Xircom REX 6000, at the time the world's smallest full function PDA. The REX 6000 was an ultra-thin PDA produced by Xircom. It was the world's smallest full-function PDA due to its size as a Type II PC Card. The REX synchronized by insertion into a host PC's PCMCIA/PC Card slot. The REX 6000 was similar to its predecessor (the Franklin REX 5000) except it included a touch screen, among other improvements. = PortGear & PortStation = Xircom acquired Entrega, a small company that produced the USB upgrade boards (for people with older PCs lacking universal serial bus connectors) and converters (USB to serial, to parallel, to Ethernet). It turned these products into its own Port-Gear line, including special drivers to support USB in Windows NT v4 systems. = Handheld products = Before being purchased by Intel in 2001, Xircom made a series of innovative connectivity devices for handheld computers, including the CompactFlash (Ethernet, Modem, GSM, etc.), SpringPort modules for Handspring, and sleds for Palm.

Rohingya: Spoken in Arakan State, Burma and by refugees from that region, currently living in Bangladesh's Chittagong Division. It is also often called Arkani by native speakers.  Tangchangya: Tanchangya is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Tanchangya people of Bangladesh. It is closely related to Chakma. * Sadri: Also a major language of Jharkhand State, India. * Bihari: Spoken primarily by the refugees from Bihar State, India. Non-Indo-Aryan languages The indigenous languages of the region are members of the Austroasiatic, Dravidian and Tibeto-Burman families. Most of these languages are spoken in mountainous areas. =Austroasiatic languages= While the more widely spoken and better-known Austroasiatic languages are spoken in Southeast Asia (e.g. Khmer and Vietnamese), smaller languages of that family are spoken by indigenous communities of northern and eastern Bangladesh. * Khasi: also a major language of Meghalaya State, India * Koda * Mundari * Pnar * Santali * War-Jaintia =Dravidian languages= Two Dravidian languages are spoken by indigenous communities of western Bangladesh. * Kurukh * Sauria Paharia =Tibeto-Burman languages= The mountainous areas along the northern and eastern edges of the Indian Subcontinent are inhabited primarily by speakers of Tibeto-Burman languages. Indigenous Tibeto-Burman-speaking communities are found through the northern, eastern, and especially the southeastern parts of Bangladesh. * A'Tong * Chak * Chin languages:  Asho  Bawm  Falam  Haka  Khumi * Koch * Garo: also a major language of Meghalaya State, India * Megam * Meitei Manipuri: also a major language of Manipur State, India * Mizo: also a major language of Mizoram State, India * Mru * Pangkhua * Rakhine/Marma: also a major language of Arakan State, Burma * Tripuri languages: a major language group of Tripura State, India  Kok Borok  Riang  Tippera  Usoi Other languages =English= English is used marginally in the judiciary. Before the commencement of the Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987, English had a considerable presence in official affairs, but since 1987 the usage of English has waned significantly in government. Due to the British colonization of the country, English is still a widely spoken and commonly understood language in Bangladesh. English is taught as a compulsory subject in all schools, colleges and universities, and is often used secondarily in the higher tier of the judiciary. However, there are English medium education system in Bangladesh. The British Council Bangladesh offers English language courses. During the colonial period, laws were written in English. =Arabic (ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©)= *\\"Arabic in Bangladesh\\" ‚Äî Banglapedia Arabic (ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿä) was an official language ever since the territory of the modern state People's Republic of Bangladesh became a part of the Bengal Sultanate. However some disagree and believe the presence of Arabic came before during the Delhi Sultanate. Arabic is used in many Muslim congregations such as the weekly Jumu'ah Salah in which a sermon (khutbah) is given in Arabic in addition to Bengali. In the Constitution of Bangladesh, there are two references to Arabic to in the introduction and Part I of the constitution. The document begins with the Arabic phrase ÿ®Ÿêÿ≥ŸíŸÖŸê ÿßŸÑŸÑŸáŸê ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸéŸëÿ≠ŸíŸÖŸ∞ŸÜŸê ÿßŸÑÿ±ŸéŸëÿ≠ŸêŸäŸíŸÖŸê which is translated as ‚ÄúIn the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful‚Äù. Article 2A declares that Islam is the state religion of the republic. Arabic is the religious language of Muslims. The Quran, Sunnah, Hadith and Muslim theology is taught in Arabic with Bengali translation. The Bangladeshi diaspora living in the Middle East has further increased the number of people who can speak Arabic in Bangladesh. Arabic is taught as a religious language in mosques, schools, colleges, universities and madrassahs as well as in tradition Bengali Muslim households. Arabic is an obligatory subject in the Madrasah education of Bangladesh. A majority of Bangladesh's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the Arabic language as part of their religious education. =Persian= *\\"Persian in Bangladesh\\" ‚Äî Banglapedia From ancient times Bengal and Persia had been in contact with each other. There were many trading posts around coastal Bengal. As people converted to Islam, they became acquainted with Arabic scriptures, as well as with Persian, the language of the Sufi preachers. The influence of the language spread rapidly after it gained the status of court language and it was the official for over 600 years (1203-1837 AD). =Urdu= Urdu (ÿßÿ±ÿØŸà‚Ä¨) was an official language in post-partition 1947 to 1971. It is still spoken by some refugees from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (most are now Bangla speakers), and in Old Dhaka. They are also living in other parts of Bangladesh.

The project was known as the I-35W Bus Rapid Transitway until July 2011 when the Metropolitan Council officially renamed the project the METRO Orange Line. Corresponding Minneapolis-St. Paul transit lines are the existing METRO Blue Line LRT, the METRO Green Line LRT to St. Paul and the METRO Red Line BRT.  History  Plans have been in place for decades to increase public transit on the I-35W corridor. Beginning in the mid-to-late 1980s light rail was studied but nothing was done. A commuter rail line that was proposed between Minneapolis and Northfield was halted in 2002 by the Minnesota Legislature banning public money from going to studies of the line. The I-35W corridor has a long history of transit, being the first freeway in the Twin Cities to have express bus service, starting in 1972. In January 2005, the Minnesota Department of Transportation released their plans to improve transit service on the corridor. They chose that BRT using existing and proposed HOV lanes would be the best option. This came just a month after Metro Transit did a complete restructure of I-35W bus services, adding better service to the corridor, including new route 535, an all-day highly frequent bus route between Downtown Minneapolis and South Bloomington Transit Center. Metro Transit's future plans in the restructure report show possible expansion of Route 535's service from just weekdays to everyday service, and route extensions to the University of Minnesota, and south to Burnsville Transit Station. About 20‚Äì30 years ago a bus stop was built on the I-35W bridge over Lake Street. The Crosstown Commons section of the freeway was reconstructed from 2007 to 2010. The project extended HOV lanes north to 42nd Street and added a station located in the median of the freeway at 46th Street. Future MNDOT and Metro Transit plans to relocate the Lake St. Station to the median of the freeway. A 2007, $133.3 million, Federal-State Urban Partnership Agreement, designed to alleviate congestion in the Minneapolis area, allowed the construction of a center high-occupancy toll lane or price-dynamic shoulder lane (for the exclusive use of buses, high-occupancy vehicles, and drivers willing to pay the dynamically priced toll) running on I-35W from Lakeville to downtown Minneapolis--a lane that could be used for the planned BRT line. Plans released in 2012 called for the METRO Orange Line to run from downtown Minneapolis to the \\"offline\\" (off-highway) Burnsville Transit Station, stopping at the \\"online\\" (on-highway) stations at Lake Street, 46th Street, and American Boulevard, and the \\"inline\\" (slightly off-highway) stations at 66th Street and 98th Street, with a potential extension to the Kenrick Ave Park and Ride in Lakeville that had been created with Urban Partnership Agreement funds.  Construction and operations  In 2016, the Counties Transit Improvement Board pledged $37.5 million toward the Orange Line. The project includes construction of new stations, including a station to replace the on-highway bus stops at Lake Street. By November 2016, preliminary designs of the stations were completed and opened to public comment. With FTA approval, the Orange Line began construction in 2017, despite a lack of committed federal funding. The construction began as a part of Minnesota Department of Transportation's larger Downtown-to-Crosstown road construction project on I-35W. In November 2018, the I-35W corridor secured $74 million in federal funding to improve roads, stations and service, including the Orange Line project. This was the last portion of the funding to be secured for the $150.7 million project. The Orange Line is planned to begin operations in 2021. At rush hour, the Lake Street Station is expected to be served by a bus every 40 seconds. Stations Preliminary designs of the stations were completed by November 2016. All stations will be ADA accessible and will include higher curbs to facilitate easier boarding to a bus. While the stations will not have completely level boarding, the higher platforms will reduce the gap compared to typical bus stops. Amenities at the stations would include bike parking, benches, real-time bus arrival information, heating, trash and recycling bins, a station marker, and an information kiosk. The designs call for energy-efficient LED lighting to be used at each station. New sidewalks will be added in some locations, to better connect the stations to the surrounding neighborhoods.

The Museum houses over 20,000 firearms and firearm related items. The Davis Museum contains guns from all around the world including Kentucky rifles, a Gatling gun, black-powder guns of all types, cannons, rare Colts, Winchesters, elephant, whaling, and outlaw guns. Besides firearms, the collection contains 1,200 German beer steins, statues by John Rogers, music boxes of the late 19th century, swords, knives, Native American artifacts, household antiques, a large boot jack collection, local cattle brands, hundreds of animal horns and trophy heads, and World War I posters. History The museum represents the story of J.M. Davis and his efforts to preserve a piece of history so that others might enjoy this \\"World's Largest Privately Owned Gun Collection\\" for generations to come. J.M Davis was given his first gun at age seven. This kindled his ambition to learn about all kinds of guns and that ambition continued 78 years until his death in 1973. In 1917 Mr. Davis moved to Claremore, Oklahoma and purchased the Mason Hotel. By 1929, he had accumulated over 99 types of guns, and at that time he had begun to display his collection on the walls of the Mason Hotel. He collected items ranging from a 500-year-old Chinese hand cannon, to the world's smallest manufactured gun. In 1965, J.M. Davis transferred ownership of his large gun collection to a trust, the J.M. Davis Foundation, Inc. The foundation then entered into an agreement with the state. In this agreement, the State was given the entire collection with the understanding that the State of Oklahoma would house, preserve and display the collection for the general public with no admission charge. Within four years, the museum opened a modern . facility to an enthusiastic public on Davis' 82nd birthday. External links * J. M. Davis Arms and Historical Museum - official site * J. M.

It is the flagship National Public Radio member station for the Miami Valley, including the cities of Dayton and Springfield. WYSO signed on in 1958 and has the distinction of being located in one of the smallest villages to host an NPR affiliate station. WYSO broadcasts in the HD Radio format. WYSO was originally on 91.5 MHz. It moved to 91.3 MHz in 1980.  History  WYSO started as a student and faculty station with a 10-watt transmitter located at the student union building of Antioch College, an institution with a unique progressive philosophy. By the early 1970s, an intermediate power increase to 3000 watts and the introduction of permanent paid staff began a move towards reflecting and serving a larger community. At that time, WYSO was known as a university-based community radio station. Significantly, several Antioch College students and other volunteers took it upon themselves to be involved with an incipient community and public radio movement in the United States. Several of those individuals have occupied key positions since that time‚Äîout of proportion to the station's modest size. NPR's John McChesney remembers starting out at WYSO Before NPR affiliation, nearly all of the station's programming was locally originated. The station had carried live Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, ad hoc networks set up by anti-Vietnam War activists, and a few recorded syndicated programs. \\"WYSO People's News\\" a local news program, was aired in the 1970s and 1980s. The rest of WYSO's program schedule was eclectic and block programming. As at other community radio stations in the United States, NPR affiliation was viewed with suspicion by some insiders, but the attendant money from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting led to a permanent staff and a local fundraising mandate. WYSO became an NPR member station and started broadcasting All Things Considered at the time of the first power increase sometime between 1971 and 1973. The eventual popularity of NPR's news and information programming was not foreseen at the time and there were endless discussions about how the newly energized medium of noncommercial radio would best serve the community. The topic of local versus national origination was an important, but not the only, subject of debate. The decision to replace morning Bluegrass music, local and unique to the region, with network news in the morning was undertaken in the late 1980s. Tom and Jim Duffee and other local bluegrass musicians introduced the genre on WYSO around 1970, and it was embraced by management at the time as a link with the larger Southwest Ohio community. In the spring of 2002, a group of listeners formed \\"Keep WYSO Local\\" in response to cutbacks to local programming. The cutbacks included canceling volunteer-hosted shows like \\"Alternate Takes\\" and \\"Women in Music,\\" which started in 1975 and was one of the country's longest running shows dedicated to women producers and musicians. Listener Joseph Lutz commented that the changes \\"will soon transform WYSO from the quirky, bohemian station enjoyed by a few thousand listeners to a station that many more will turn on and let play as pleasant background sound that in no way disturbs listeners with unpredictable programming.\\" The moves led to widespread protests in the Yellow Springs community as the group continued to debate the future of the station with the University. WYSO became independently owned and operated from Antioch College in 2019, for which the college received $3.5 million as compensation. The station continues in collaboration with the college, such as by working with college students as interns.  Programming  Locally produced Rise When The Rooster Crows, once a daily morning feature, now airs traditional Bluegrass music on Sunday mornings. Morning Edition has aired in its place since the late 1980s. Bluegrass music is also aired on Saturday evenings with the program \\"Down Home Bluegrass.\\" Programming from Public Radio International and BBC World Service is also aired. As well as a segment where William Felker reads his book Poor Will's Almanack.  Management  Most local programming, as measured by airtime, is produced by volunteers. Volunteers, listeners and donors to the station have asserted an unofficial role in station governance since the 1970s when the station was managed under Antioch's Community Government. In December 2008, WYSO announced that Neenah Ellis, a public radio producer and host would be the station's next general manager. She and her husband, NPR host and author Noah Adams, made their home in Yellow Springs. By late 2019, Neenah Ellis was President of WYSO-owner Miami Valley Public Media, Inc., and Luke Dennis, aka Lucas Dennis, was General Manager of the station.

Career Camara was born in the Senegalese interior, though his exact date and place of birth are not known. His ethnicity has been described as Soninke,Bonneau, 1952 but a French contemporary described Camara as having \\"a mix of Moor and Berber blood\\" and notes that he spoke the Toucouleur language.Chavannes, 1929, p. 160 Camara was recruited as a laptot or colonial soldier, probably in the early 1870s. In Dakar, January 1880, he volunteered to join an expedition led by Franco-Italian explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza from the coast of Gabon to the Congo River. The mission included 11 other West African soldiers, 4 Gabonese interpreters, and 4 Frenchmen including Brazza. Camara quickly proved his worth on the expedition, learning local languages and winning the support of local populations, as well as the respect of his French commanders. In October 1880, Brazza assigned Camara to lead a 3-man detachment tasked with founding an outpost in Mfoa, which is the site of present-day Brazzaville on the right bank of the Congo River. Camara and his men stayed there for more than 18 months until they received orders to return to Gabon. During this period at Mfoa, in which Camara received neither reinforcements nor significant supplies from the French, he established excellent relations with local communities. Through his hunting skills, he not only kept his men fed but even made regular contributions of meat (hippopotamus and buffalo) to chiefs in the area, who nicknamed him mayele (meaning a resourceful person) and tata nyama, meaning \\"meat father.\\" Camara carried out his mission to show the French flag and defend France's newly acquired territory from rival claims by Belgium.Chavannes, 1929 Camara twice encountered Henry Morton Stanley, the American explorer who was leading Belgian efforts to claim and colonize the Congo region. They first met in July 1881, when Camara and his two men went to visit Stanley's camp at Kinshasa on the left bank of the river. To dissuade the American from trying to expand Belgian territorial claims across the river, Camara showed him a copy of the treaty a local king, Makoko Iloo I, had signed with Brazza granting his territory to France. The two men met again in January 1882, when Stanley sailed across the river in a newly arrived steamboat accompanied by a large number of Zanzibari mercenaries. French historians have speculated that Stanley hoped this show of force would cause Camara and his men to abandon their post at Mfoa, thus letting Belgium usurp France's claim to the territory. In any case, Camara's squad held its ground, and Stanley and his men promptly returned to their camp across the river. Stanley wrote in his memoirs that he was impressed by the Senegalese sergeant, who appeared very devoted to his mission and very much in charge of his men.Stanley, 1885 In May 1882, a messenger brought a written order from the French military command that Camara and his men were to leave Mfoa and return to the French post in Franceville, Gabon. Camara was dubious of this order, and suspected that Belgium had pressured the French to withdraw. Prior to leaving, Camara visited all the local chiefs and told them that his absence would be only temporary, and urged them to remain loyal to France while he was away.Chavannes, 1935 Brazza, who had since returned to France, mounted another expedition to the Congo basin in 1883, and put Camara in charge of recruiting the mission's African personnel in Dakar. Once on the Gabonese coast, Camara was responsible for purchasing dugout canoes with which the expedition would travel into the interior. When they reached the Congo River, they found local populations overjoyed at Camara's return; his personal efforts may have prevented these populations from succumbing to Stanley's influence. Throughout this mission Camara was indispensable to his commanders, supplying ample meat from his hunts and maintaining the trust of the local people. His importance to the French mission was so great that, as Brazza's deputy Charles de Chavannes later claimed, the Belgians in Kinshasa put a bounty on his head.Chavannes, 1935, p. 198 Before departing for the coast in 1884, Brazza left Chavannes in charge of the new permanent Brazzaville outpost; Malamine served as Chavannes' aide-de-camp and was instrumental in provisioning the post with food. On February 1, 1885, during a ceremony in Brazzaville, Camara was awarded the M√©daille militaire, among France's highest honors given to non-citizens in its armed forces.Chavannes, 1935 But his health was ailing from what appears to have been a bladder infection. By early 1885 the camp physician believed that Camara was dying, and the sergeant went home to Senegal later that year. He died in January 1886 in the military hospital in Goree Island. The precise cause of his death is unknown. Legacy While Camara's singular contributions to the establishment of France's Congo colony were generally unappreciated during his lifetime (indeed, he was never even able to collect the pay from his last mission), in the years following his death the French dedicated a bronze plaque in Brazzaville and christened a steamboat in his honor. A side street in the Poto-Poto neighborhood of Brazzaville was also named after him. In his native Senegal, a secondary school was renamed in his honor. During an official visit to Brazzaville in April 2018, Senegalese President Macky Sall paid tribute to Camara and his role in Congo's colonial history.\\"Macky Sall au Congo: Un vibrant hommage rendu au sergent Malamine Camara.\\" Le Soleil, 30 April 2018, http://www.lesoleil.sn/2016-03-22-23-17-43/item/77919-macky-sall-au-congo-un- vibrant-hommage-rendu-au-sergent-malamine-camara.html References External sources * Bonneau, Bernard.

Pheophytin or phaeophytin (abbreviated Pheo) is a chemical compound that serves as the first electron carrier intermediate in the electron transfer pathway of Photosystem II (PS II) in plants, and the photosynthetic reaction center (RC P870) found in purple bacteria. In both PS II and RC P870, light drives electrons from the reaction center through pheophytin, which then passes the electrons to a quinone (QA) in RC P870 and RC P680. The overall mechanisms, roles, and purposes of the pheophytin molecules in the two transport chains are analogous to each other. Structure In biochemical terms, pheophytin is a chlorophyll molecule lacking a central Mg2+ ion. It can be produced from chlorophyll by treatment with a weak acid, producing a dark bluish waxy pigment.http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pheophytin Merriam-Webster Medical Dictionary definition of Pheophytin The probable etymology comes from this description, with pheo meaning duskyhttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pheo- Definition of pheo in The American Heritage Stedman's Medical Dictionary and phyt meaning vegetation.phyt. CollinsDictionary.com. Collins English Dictionary - Complete & Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved October 19, 2012.  History and discovery  In the 1977s, scientists Klevanik, Klimov, Shuvalov performed a series of experiments to demonstrate that it is pheophytin and not plastoquinone that serves as the primary electron acceptor in photosystem II. Using several experiments, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), they were able to show that pheophytin was reducible and, therefore, the primary electron acceptor between P680 and plastoquinone (Klimov, Allakhverdiev, Klevanik, Shuvalov). This discovery was met with fierce opposition, since many believed pheophytin to only be a byproduct of chlorophyll degradation. Therefore, more experiments ensued to prove that pheophytin is indeed the primary electron acceptor of PSII, occurring between P680 and plastoquinone (Klimov, Allakhverdiev, Shuvalov). The data that was obtained is as follows: # Photo-reduction of pheophytin has been observed in various mixtures containing PSII reaction centers. # The quantity of pheophytin is in direct proportion to the number of PSII reaction centers. # Photo-reduction of pheophytin occurs at temperatures as low as 100K, and is observed after the reduction of plastoquinone. These observations are all characteristic of photo-conversions of reaction center components.  Reaction in purple bacteria  Pheophytin is the first electron carrier intermediate in the photoreaction center (RC P870) of purple bacteria. Its involvement in this system can be broken down into 5 basic steps. The first step is excitation of the bacteriochlorophylls (Chl)2 or the special pair of chlorophylls. This can be seen in the following reaction. *(Chl)2 \\\\+ 1 photon ‚Üí (Chl)2* (excitation) The second step involves the (Chl)2 passing an electron to pheophytin, producing a negatively charged radical (the pheophytin) and a positively charged radical (the special pair of chlorophylls), which results in a charge separation. *(Chl)2* \\\\+ Pheo ‚Üí ¬∑(Chl)2+ \\\\+ ¬∑Pheo‚àí (charge separation) The third step is the rapid electron movement to the tightly bound menaquinone, QA, which immediately donates the electrons to a second, loosely bound quinone (QB). Two electron transfers convert QB to its reduced form (QBH2). *2¬∑Pheo‚àí \\\\+ 2H+ \\\\+ QB ‚Üí 2Pheo + QBH2 (quinone reduction) The fifth and final step involves the filling of the ‚Äúhole‚Äù in the special pair by an electron from a heme in cytochrome c. This regenerates the substrates and completes the cycle, allowing for subsequent reactions to take place.  Involvement in photosystem II  In photosystem II, pheophytin plays a very similar role. It again acts as the first electron carrier intermediate in the photosystem. After P680 becomes excited to P680*, it transfers an electron to pheophytin, which converts the molecule into a negatively charged radical. Two negatively charged pheophytin radicals quickly pass their extra electrons to two consecutive plastoquinone molecules. Eventually, the electrons pass through the cytochrome b6f molecule and leaves photosystem II. The reactions outlined above in the section concerning purple bacteria give a general illustration of the actual movement of the electrons through pheophytin and the photosystem. The overall scheme is: # Excitation # Charge separation # Plastoquinone reduction # Regeneration of substrates  See also  *Photosynthesis *Photosystem *Chlorophyll *Reaction center *P680 *Biosynthesis of chlorophyllide a (precursor to pheophytin)  References   *\\"Photosynthetic Molecules Section.\\" Library of 3-D Molecular Structures. 22 April 2007 *Xiong, Ling, and Richard Sayre. \\"The Identification of Potential Pheophytin Binding Sites in the Photosystem II Reaction Center of Chlamydomondas by Site-Directed Mutagenesis.\\" (2000).

He was selected for the Gentlemen against the Players in 1923, and also appeared at first-class level for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), HK Foster's XI and Free Foresters. MacLean attended Eton College and Cambridge University without playing in their First XIs.Wisden 1988, p. 1243. He made his first-class debut for HK Foster's XI against Worcestershire at Hereford in July 1919, making 12 and 18 not out. He made no dismissals in the match, nor in his appearance for the same side against the Australian Imperial Forces just two days later. His third match, again for HK Foster's XI and once more against Worcestershire, produced an innings of 59 from number ten, but again no dismissals. He did not play first- class cricket again until 1922, when he was a regular part of a very weak Worcestershire side (they finished bottom of the County Championship with only one win from 26 matches). His county debut, against Warwickshire at Edgbaston, at last gave him his maiden dismissal when he stumped opener Leonard Bates in the second innings. It was not a particularly successful season overall for MacLean, however: he finished with only 459 runs from 41 innings and made 16 dismissals (6 caught, 10 stumped). That winter MacLean toured Australia and New Zealand with MCC, and though he did poorly against the Australian state sides, he performed rather better on the New Zealand section of the tour, making two half-centuries including 84 in an unofficial Test against New Zealand at Wellington. Returning to England, he enjoyed the best summer of his career with both bat and gloves. His 710 runs included his only hundred: a rearguard, if ultimately unsuccessful, 121 in an hour and a half against Nottinghamshire after Worcestershire had fallen to 56/5 in their second innings. Behind the stumps MacLean managed 46 dismissals, easily his best season's tally. He played only half a dozen games in 1924, without conspicuous success, and was then absent from first-class cricket until 1930, by which time he had moved to Gloucestershire. He played three times for them that year, and thrice more in 1932, making his last first-class appearance against Middlesex at Clifton College in early August 1932. MacLean's father Montague MacLean played five first-class matches in the 1890s, for MCC and Lord Hawke's XI.

Lubsan Tepkin was born to Dandun Tepkin, a horsebreeder and a member of a prominent family. He joined the Kalmyk clergy at a young age and became Baksha of the khurul in his native aimak by the age of 28 in 1903. In so doing, Lama Tepkin replaced Menko Bormanzhinov who became Lama of the Don Kalmyks. In 1911, Lama Tepkin abdicated his position and moved to Tibet, where he would remain until the fall of 1922. Lama Tepkin moved to Petrograd, Russia in the fall of 1922 to become a deputy Tibetan envoy and a lecturer in Mongolian and Tibetan at the Leningrad Institute of Oriental Living Languages. Three years later in 1925, Lama Tepkin traveled to the Kalmyk Autonomous Oblast to attend the second conference of the Kalmyk Buddhist clergy where he was elected the ≈†ajin Lama of the Kalmyk people. Lama Tepkin held the position of ≈†ajin Lama until his arrest by the NKVD in 1931. He was sentenced to imprisonment without a formal trial by an NKVD tribunal. Lama Tepkin reportedly spent the last years of his life working as a clerk on a dairy farm near Tashkent where he was last heard of in 1941. References *Balinov, Shamba.

Approximately one month after birth (31 days for boys and 33 days for girlsAlice Mabel Bacon, \\"Japanese Girls and women\\" revised and enlarged edition, Boston and New York, Houghton Mifflin Company, The Riverside Press Cambridge, 1902), parents and grandparents bring the child to a Shinto shrine, to express gratitude to the deities for the birth of a baby and have a shrine priest pray for his or her health and happiness. The practice is similar to a Christian infant baptism. Today, most Miyamairi are practiced between one month and 100 days after birth. In famous and busy shrines, the ceremony is held every hour, often during weekends. A group of a dozen babies and their families are usually brought into the hall, one group after another. A Shinto priest wearing a costume and headgear appears between the group and the altar, reciting a prayer and swinging a tamagushi right and left. During the prayer, the priest cites the name of the baby, the names of the parents, the family's address, and the baby's birthday. Afterwards, the parents and grandparents come forward one by one, bow to the altar, and place tamagushis upon it. At the end of the ceremony, sake in a red wooden cup is given to each person in attendance; small gifts are often given to the family. A shrine typically charges between ¬•5,000 and ¬•10,000 per baby for this ceremony.

Lama Bormanzhinov was noted for promoting public education among the Don Kalmyks. He also followed Ochir Lama and Lama Arkad Chubanov in publishing the lunar calendar. Moreover, both he and Lama Lubsan Sharab Tepkin were responsible for the publication of at least 12 titles of sacred Buddhist text in the Kalmyk language. Lama Bormanzhinov died of typhus in April 1919 after returning to his native aimak from a refugee camp in the Kuban, where he fled persecution from the Bolsheviks.

While not run by the National Basketball Association (NBA), the league previously hosted NBA teams with their first and second round draft picks, undrafted players, and free agents. Due to the NBA lockout in 1998, no NBA teams were entered into the league that year.Not So Hot Due to the rising popularity of the Las Vegas Summer League, 2006 was the last year the NBA sent teams to the SPL.Summer Pro League (SPL) 2007 was the SPL's final year in operation, during which the league played with amateur teams.

Bryant and teammate Derek Fisher mentioned the game while reminiscing on their career together during post-game interviews following the Lakers 2010 NBA Finals victory. Bryant returned to the league in 1997. The 1998 Summer Pro League was not well attended due to the ongoing NBA lockout.

The university paid for the initial water, sewer and roadway construction; in exchange, it leases the land to retail tenants and the revenue goes into its Land Endowment Fund. Preston Avenue bisects the property and is its major access road; a secondary access utilizing the original north/south Preston roadway alignment, allows access from eastbound Circle Drive. Calgary-based Rencor Developments formed a joint venture called Preston Crossing Properties Inc. with two Saskatchewan companies, Harvard Developments and TGS Properties. It completed all development, leasing and financing for the project; the architecture mirrored the gothic elements of the University campus buildings. In the fall of 2005, Harvard gained sole acquisition of the shopping center. Construction began in the spring of 2002 and the first stores opened in the fall of the same year. Development has continued in phases, although full build-out has not yet been reached. As of 2010, three building phases have been completed; a fourth phase was announced in June 2010. The shopping area had already lost one of its originating tenants, with the Shoppers Drug Mart location going out of business in 2012, after 10 years of operation. By 2013, a booming economy and low retail vacancy rate prompted plans for Preston Crossing to expand further. The property developer asked for restrictions on the size and types of businesses to be lifted. The restrictions had been implemented over unrealized concerns that the big box complex would take business away from other commercial districts like 8th Street, Broadway Avenue and downtown. In 2014, a deal was signed to build the fifth and final phase of Preston Crossing, utilizing the last of the available land. The new buildings are expected to be completed by the spring of 2017.

He has promoted this belief in a self- published book titled Defeating Eurabia, and stated that \\"Islam and all those who practise it must be totally and physically removed from the Western world\\". Anders Behring Breivik was inspired by Fjordman's belief in the Eurabia conspiracy theory, a supposed secret Muslim plan to take over Europe, and quoted him extensively - 111 times - in his manifesto.

His parents are well-known personalities in √Ölesund; his father an arranger of music concerts with a past in the former Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Socialist Youth League (m‚Äìl), and his mother a historian and writer. Jensen himself was for a short period in his youth a member of the Socialist Youth, the youth organisation of the Socialist Left Party. In 2011 he said that he was not affiliated with any political party, but that except having voted once in an election for the Labour Party, he has voted for the Progress Party. Jensen finished his conscription service at the military camp in Setermoen. Considering himself an unsatisfactory soldier, he has never again touched a weapon. Before writing as Fjordman, Jensen wrote a few times in newspapers using his full name. Early public writings from Jensen appear in 2000 in the national newspaper Dagbladet and the regional paper Sunnm√∏rsposten, where he criticises feminism. He also wrote comments under full name in newspapers Aftenposten and Verdens Gang. Jensen went on to study Arabic at the University of Bergen and the American University in Cairo. By this time he had already begun to nurture a growing skepticism towards Islamic culture, He was present in Cairo during the September 11 attacks. According to Jensen, \\"Western media claimed no Arabs were happy about the attacks. This is not true. Some of my neighbors celebrated the event with a spontaneous cake party, and felt what had happened was great.\\" After returning home, Jensen began writing commentaries to Norway's leading newspapers, but claims his controversial opinions were not published by the mainstream media. After having a number of articles rejected, he eventually decided to start his own blog instead. He wrote on several blogs under the pseudonym \\"Norwegian kafir\\" in the early 2000s, but eventually took the pseudonym \\"Fjordman\\" in 2005. During his early post-Cairo years Jensen also worked for the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Middle East. From the start of 2002 to the summer of 2003, he worked for them as an observer in Hebron, in the West Bank, in the service of the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH). The TIPH mission in Hebron monitors breaches of international humanitarian law and other agreements between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. They communicate their findings to the involved parties and the six member states of TIPH. Jensen, who says that he turned against Islam after 9/11, remained in this position in Hebron until mid-2003. Following this, he completed his master's degree in culture and technology from the University of Oslo. His master thesis, published in 2004, was titled Blogging Iran ‚Äì A Case Study of Iranian English Language Weblogs, and discussed censorship and blogging in Iran. Following this, he worked at a day care centre until 2011, when his identity as the blogger Fjordman was revealed.Dagbladet, paper edition, 6 August 2011. In August 2011, Norwegian professor Arnulf Hagen claimed that there was much to suggest that Jensen had a Wikipedia account which made 2000 edits.H√∏yreekstremt angrep p√• Wikipedia , Torgny Has√•s, LO- Aktuelt, FriFagbevegelse.no 26.08.2011 In June 2012, writing as Fjordman, he heavily criticised Wikipedia in an article entitled \\"The Bias and Dishonesty of Wikipedia\\" in EuropeNews.Fjordman. The Bias and Dishonesty of Wikipedia. EuropeNews 19 June 2012  Writings under the pen name Fjordman  Fjordman blogged on his own web log in 2005, giving it up at the end of the year. Since then, he has \\"guested\\" and commented in other blogs including Brussels Journal, Gates of Vienna, Jihad Watch, Document.no, Faith Freedom International, Free Republic, Daily Pundit, Global Politician and FrontPage Magazine. Fjordman published a compilation of his articles in print via lulu.com in November 2008. Norwegian historian Vidar Enebakk has criticised the way he thought Fjordman misused academic research for political purposes. √òyvind Str√∏mmen argues that Fjordman's essays fulfill all the criteria of Roger Griffin's definition of fascism.  Views  Jensen has written negatively about multiculturalism, the European Union, feminism and Islam. He is an outspoken proponent of Bat Ye'or's conspiracy theory of \\"Eurabia\\", according to which Europe and the Arab states would join forces to make life impossible for Israel and Islamize the old continent. Jensen wrote an essay titled \\"The Eurabia Code\\" in support of the concept, in which he says that \\"[T]he 'Jewish threat' in the 1930s was entirely fictional, whereas the 'Islamic threat' now is very real.\\" His self-published book compiling his articles is titled Defeating Eurabia. According to The Independent, Jensen writes \\"screeds accusing Muslims of secretly planning to take over Europe.\\" The conservative blog, The Brussels Journal, described the book as providing a \\"thorough analysis of the causes and circumstances of the islamization process.\\" As a solution to this imagined invasion, Jensen advocates the deportation of all Muslims back to their homelands. The Norwegian News Agency has stated that \\"Fjordman\\" \\"[is] considered a very central far-right and anti- Islamic voice in Europe.\\" Andrew Brown characterises him as \\"[an] Islamophobe who has for years been predicting civil war between Muslims and their neighbours.\\" The researcher Terje Emberland at the Norwegian Center for Studies of Holocaust and Religious Minorities states that \\"Fjordman\\"'s views are based on a conspiracy theory, and that \\"Islamophobes like Fjordman believe they have seen through an evil power that will throw Europe into a civil war. Therefore, they argue that all means must be used to save the Western culture; implicit in this is the threat of violence.\\" Jensen believes that the Western governments promoting the influx of non-white immigrants are demonstrating \\"white masochism\\", and that white people have the right to \\"preserve [their] heritage\\" and are \\"under no obligation to commit collective suicide\\". He denies that this is a white supremacist view, stating that \\"Whites ... are currently the only racial group specifically denied the opportunity to defend their countries and heritage.\\" He also rejects accusations of racism, stating that \\"non-whites attacking whites\\" constitutes \\"the vast majority of racist violence in Western nations\\". He argues that \\"in Europe today, Marxists and Leftists of all kinds virtually control Western media and academia\\", and that \\"White critics of mass immigration\\" are systematically demonized as racists and right-wing extremists. Jensen argues for the preservation of a native majority, including indigenous Europeans, and demands an extremely restrictive immigration policy, the dissolution of the European Union and the \\"rejection of multiculturalism\\". He argues that otherwise, Europeans would have to conclude that the governments have given up on their people, and that the laws and taxes which they impose on them are therefore illegitimate. =On Islam= In November 2015 Fjordman summarized his view of Islam as \\"a permanent world war\\":  2011 Norway attacks  Shortly after the bombing of Oslo in the 2011 Norway attacks (when it still was believed the terrorist was an Islamist), Fjordman asked his regular readers at the Gates of Vienna blog to \\"remember\\" that Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was as much a \\"pathetic sucker for Islam as it is humanly possible to be\\" and his Labour/Socialist Left/Centre Party government ‚Äúthe most dhimmi appeasing of all Western governments (‚Ä¶) suicidal and cowardly‚Äù.Berg-Nordlie, M: \\"In the wake of terrorism. Countering discourses of ethnic hatred \\". NIBR International 08.09.2011 When the shooting at Ut√∏ya became known a few hours later, Fjordman described the Workers' Youth League (AUF) under attack as a \\"gang of anti- Israeli, pro-Palestine youth-socialists\\". Jensen also voiced a rather basic antipathy towards Oslo's immigrant population: in relation to a TV interview with a man referred to as a \\"Norwegian eyewitness\\" ‚Äì a person of Arab origin who had the windows of his restaurant blown to pieces by the blast ‚Äì a Gates of Vienna reader sarcastically said to Jensen that he did not know Norwegians looked so much like Arabs. Jensen's reply was that \\"in Oslo they do. Arabs, Kurds, Pakistanis, Somalis, you name it. Anything and everything is fine as long as they rape the natives and destroy the country, which they do\\". Anders Behring Breivik, the man accused in the 2011 Norway attacks, frequently praised writings of Fjordman, citing him extensively in his manifesto. In terms of goals and means Breivik is quoted as saying, \\"Our views are quite similar with the exception of me being an actual armed resistance fighter.\\" In response to learning the identity of the terrorist, Fjordman strongly distanced himself from Breivik, whom he referred to as a \\"violent psychopath\\", and said he \\"intensely dislike[d]\\" the fact that he was cited by Breivik. He also advocated giving Breivik the death penalty. In particular, there is a 2008 article in the anti-Islamic blog The Brussels Journal where Fjordman focuses on a quote from Norwegian social anthropologist Thomas Hylland Eriksen. > \\"Our most important task ahead is to deconstruct the majority, and we must > deconstruct them so thoroughly that they will never be able to call > themselves the majority again.\\" ‚ÄìThomas Hylland Eriksen (2008) Apparently based on Fjordman's article, this quote has since become a focal point of the 1,500-page manifesto of Breivik, as well as Breivik's defence speech during his 2012 trial. Following the terror attacks the quote has been oft repeated by right-wing extremists all across Europe. Eriksen has since admitted that taken out of context the quote does look scary, but that it has a much more innocent meaning when properly understood. In the aftermath of the attacks, the police confiscated Jensen's PC and questioned him, saying they wanted to \\"investigate how [he] might have influenced the charged man\\". In the weeks following the terrorist attacks, there was intense speculation regarding his identity. The week after the attacks Jensen reported to PST, the Norwegian internal security police. A few days later he was called in for questioning, and agreed to have his premises searched. The same day he revealed his identity in an interview with the newspaper Verdens Gang, and proclaimed that he would never again blog under the pseudonym Fjordman. He also questioned whether he would ever return to blogging, citing his exhaustion from the time after the attacks. The next day he did blog under that name, describing how he had felt abused when the police searched through his house, a treatment he viewed as \\"politically motivated\\". Prior to the search Jensen hid his computer in a safety deposit box at the central station in Oslo. According to the police he had not intended to provide the computer, but changed his mind when he understood that the police would ask for a court order if he refused. Blog announcement of 10 October 2011 On 10 October 2011, Jensen announced on a blog that due to having been involuntarily mixed in with the Breivik- case, he had become unemployed and was in the process of finding a new place to live. He in turn asked for donations from his supporters in what he dubbed a \\"Fjordman Relocation Fund\\". He also complained that his reply to a critical article in newspaper Aftenposten had been rejected by the newspaper (it was instead, however, published on the same blog), and about having been indirectly parodied in a Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation show as a paraplegic character whose last name was \\"Fjordland.\\"  Continued writings  Jensen wrote in an opinion piece published in Verdens Gang on 24 October, under the headline \\"Fjordman lives on,\\" that he would continue writing with \\"undiminished force.\\" He also announced that he would continue publishing his writings on blogs in English and Norwegian if newspapers would not publish them, and that he planned to release a new book by the next year. In an opinion piece published in Aftenposten the same day, he complained about what he considered to be harassment by the police in the aftermath of the July terror attacks. In 2013, Jensen was granted 75,000 Norwegian kroner from the Fritt Ord foundation for a book he was writing on the Breivik case, titled Vitne til vanvidd [Witness to Madness]. The grant was criticized by AUF leader Eskil Pedersen Oda Marie Midtb√∏e (14 June 2013): Eskil Pedersen reagerer kraftig p√• Fjordman-pengest√∏tte VG, retrieved 14 June 2013 and others who considered the grant as giving a platform to political extremism and offensive to victims and survivors of the 2011 terror attacks.Sigrid Helene Svendsen (14 June 2013): Fjordman¬ª f√•r penger fra Fritt Ord VG, retrieved 14 June 2013Sondre Valen (14 June 2013): Bel√∏nning til ekstremismen NRK, retrieved 14 June 2013 Initially, no Norwegian publisher was willing to publish Fjordman's work. Document Forlag eventually chose to publish the book in 2015. In July 2013 an editor (debattredakt√∏r) at Dagsavisen called Fjordman \\"one of Europe's most influential Islamophobe ideologists\\" and grouped him with Vidkun Quisling, Anders Behring Breivik and Varg Vikernes as a \\"great internationally known extremist of hate\\".. Jensen wrote in response that unlike the other three, all convicted criminals, he had not even received a parking ticket.  Print publications  * Defeating Eurabia.

A member of several culturally elite circles of his day, he is perhaps equally remembered as the subject of drawings by prominent European artists Henri Matisse and Amedeo Modigliani. Having met Matisse in Gustave Moreau's atelier in 1896, the two would continue a lifelong friendship that included hundreds of letters of published correspondence as well as collaboration on such works as Repli (1947) and Apollinaire (1953).

The book continues the idea of \\"stickiness\\" popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in The Tipping Point, seeking to explain what makes an idea or concept memorable or interesting. A similar style to Gladwell's is used, with a number of stories and case studies followed by principles. The stories range from urban legends, such as the \\"Kidney Heist\\" in the introduction; to business stories, as with the story of Southwest Airlines, \\"the low price airline\\"; to inspirational, personal stories such as that of Floyd Lee, a passionate mess hall manager. Each chapter includes a section entitled \\"Clinic\\", in which the principles of the chapter are applied to a specific case study or idea to demonstrate the principle's application. Overview The book's outline follows the acronym \\"SUCCES\\" (with the last s omitted). Each letter refers to a characteristic that can help make an idea \\"sticky\\": * Simple ‚Äì find the core of any idea * Unexpected ‚Äì grab people's attention by surprising them * Concrete ‚Äì make sure an idea can be grasped and remembered later * Credible ‚Äì give an idea believability * Emotional ‚Äì help people see the importance of an idea * Stories ‚Äì empower people to use an idea through narrative Authors Chip Heath is a professor of organizational behavior at Graduate School of Business at Stanford University. Dan Heath, a former researcher at Harvard, is a consultant and developer of innovative textbooks. They also write a regular feature for Fast Company magazine.Authors' profiles Reception The book was commercially successful, appearing on the New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller lists, alongside a 24-month listing on BusinessWeek book listings. Writing in The Guardian, William Leith described it as a \\"smart, lively book\\" that is \\"fun to read\\" and will give readers \\"an insight into the power of bad ideas\\" as well as better ones. In her review in the Stanford Social Innovation Review, Judith Samuelson observed that \\"The Heath brothers have taught me that if anyone is going to 'get' my idea ‚Äì need it, buy it, fund it, use it ‚Äì I need to radically shorten my elevator pitch.

The nearest town is Ramsey, Illinois, and the park is adjacent to U.S. Highway 51. The park is managed by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR). Hunting, fishing, and boating The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) manages Ramsey Lake State Recreation Area (SRA) for a variety of active recreational uses, including boating, fishing, and hunting. The park centers on Ramsey Lake, a long, artificial reservoir begun in 1947. The reservoir is named after Ramsey Creek, a tributary of the Kaskaskia River.Kathy Andrews, \\"Old Fox Chase Grounds\\", Outdoor Illinois XVI:7 (July 2008), pages 2-15 Before the creation of the state park, this parcel of property was called the Old Fox Chase Grounds; and Ramsey Lake occupies a valley named Fox Hunt Hollow in honor of the annual fox hunts that were hosted here by the Central Illinois Foxhunter's Association. Hunting today centers on whitetail deer, which are hunted by bow only, upland birds such as mourning doves, pheasants, quail, and wild turkey, and small game such as coyotes, raccoons, and squirrels. Ramsey Lake is stocked with largemouth bass, bluegill, catfish, crappie, and sunfish. There is a power limit on the lake (electric motors only). The state park also contains six small fishing ponds and 24 small vernal ponds and patches of non-fishing wetland managed for frogs and other amphibia. Other outdoor recreation opportunities are provided by a network of state park trails, headed by the Equestrian Trail and the Old Fox Chase Grounds Trail. Illinois Natural Area A disjunct land parcel, the Ramsey Railroad Prairie, is managed by IDNR from the nearby state recreation area. Currently, the railroad prairie is a strip of land of in length and in width, running north-and-south adjacent to Township Road 750E. It is classified by IDNR as dry-mesic and mesic prairie. Historically, the prairie grows on a strip of land originally granted to the Illinois Central Railroad in 1850 to construct what was planned to be the railroad's central Illinois main line from Centralia, Illinois to Peru, Illinois. The economic boom of the 1850s in Chicago caused the Illinois Central's Chicago spur line to supplant the railroad's original main line. The Centralia-Peru line was eventually de-emphasized and abandoned. The railroad prairie was dedicated as an Illinois Natural Area in October 1997.

In 1963 Tyler and Smith found that this mushroom contains serotonin, 5-HTP and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In many field guides it is erroneously listed as psychoactive, however the mushroom does not produce any hallucinogenic effects. It is sometimes mistaken for the psychedelic Panaeolus cinctulus or Panaeolus olivaceus both of which share the same habitat and can be differentiated by their jet black spores.

The bat is endemic to Australia, where it occurs from southeastern Queensland to eastern New South Wales. They are the sole species of genus Micronomus and referred to by variations on east-coast free-tailed bat. Taxonomy  The description of the species was published by John Edward Gray in 1839. The specific epithet is named for Norfolk Island, where the type specimen was alleged to have been collected. Micronomus norfolkensis is the type species of genus Micronomus, and the only currently recognised. The name of the taxon was published in a checklist by Tom Iredale and Ellis Troughton in 1934, but this lacked a diagnosis and designated nomen nudum. Troughton gave the name again, with a valid description, in Furred Animals of Australia in 1944. The print date of Troughton's book is 1943, but his correspondence with the publisher has determined it was not issued until 1944. The taxon was published with a revised diagnosis in 2014, which separated this subgenus and Setirostris, also with a sole species (Mormopterus eleryi), from the diversity discovered in Australian molossids. This revision assigned the taxon to a subgenus, giving the combination Mormopterus (Micronomus) norfolkensis, before the elevation to a monotypic arrangement as genus Micronomus. The species is also referred to as the east-coast free-tailed bat, east-coast freetail bat, and eastern coastal free-tailed bat. Other common names include eastern little mastiff bat and eastern freetail-bat.Eastern Freetail-bat Profile. Threatened Species. Office of Environment and Heritage. NSW Government. Downloaded on 25 March 2015. The description for Micronomus was reviewed in an evaluation of the taxonomic concepts (Reardon, 2014), following a description published in 2008 by the same author. The new diagnosis identified the number of lower incisors of Micronomus (3) differed from the species allied to Mormopterus (2) and lacked the pronounced gular sac that is present in Mormopterus. The new subgenus, later elevated to genus, Setirostris, was distinguished by the form of the corresponding upper molars, the lack of the course bristles on the face of Setirostris, and the great difference in morphology of the glans penis; phylogenic support was provided by molecular comparisons of alleles and mitochondrial DNA. A similar diagnosis is provided to separate Ozimops, dentition, penis morphology, and the phylogenetic analysis, but notes the more evidently dome shape profile of the skull, which is significantly flattened in species of that genus. Description This bat has dark brown to reddish brown fur with a paler belly. Biology and ecology The species has been collected only occasionally, and little is known about its biology and ecology. Although the species may roost communally, it is usually solitary. Range and habitat It has been observed in dry eucalypt forest, wet sclerophyll forest, and riparian rainforest habitat. A colony was found roosting in a house. Females with young have been observed in grey mangrove (Avicennia marina) forests.McConville, A., Law, B. S., & Mahony, M. J. (2013). Mangroves as maternity roosts for a colony of the rare east-coast free-tailed bat (Mormopterus norfolkensis) in south-eastern Australia. Wildlife Research 40(4), 318-27. Conservation It is thought that there are fewer than 10,000 mature individuals. Threats to the species may include habitat loss from timber harvesting, coastal development, and alterations of natural fire regimes.

Skomantas, or Komantas (in Yotvingian *Gomants or *Komants, in Ruthenian Komat, in Latin Koommat, in German Skomand and Skumand; ca. 1225(?) ‚Äì after 1285) was a powerful duke and pagan priest of the Sudovians/Yotvingians, one of the early Baltic tribes (according to historian S. C. Rowell and some other researchers, this duke of Sudovia seems to be identical to Skalmantas, the supposed progenitor of Gediminas' dynasty, the Gediminids). He was at the height of his power during the 1260s and 1270s. Skomantas is first mentioned by Peter von Dusburg during the Great Prussian Uprising (1260‚Äì1274) as a leader of the 1263 raid on Che≈Çmno, a stronghold of the Teutonic Knights. He also led campaigns against Pinsk and other Slavic territories and therefore could not fully support the uprising. After the uprising Skomantas, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men against the Teutonic Knights. However, the Old Prussians and other Balts were losing their power. Skomantas' estate was devastated in 1280‚Äì1281 and he escaped with three sons, Rukals, Gedetes and Galms, to Black Ruthenia, controlled at that time by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. However, he soon returned, was baptized in the Roman Catholic rite, and acknowledged the superiority of the Knights. Skomantas went on to lead armies on behalf of the Knights and was awarded lands within Prussia. His tribe lost the fight against the Knights and did not survive as an entity.

It was first synthesized in 1962 and re-emerged recently due to hopes of achieving high hardness comparable to that of diamond. The reported ultrahigh hardness has been questioned, although this is a matter of definition as in the initial test rhenium diboride was able to scratch diamond. The production method of this material does not involve high pressures as with other hard synthetic materials, such as cubic boron nitride, which makes production cheap. However, rhenium itself is an expensive metal. The compound is formed from a mixture of rhenium, noted for its resistance to high pressure, and boron, which forms short, strong covalent bonds with rhenium.  Synthesis  Rhenium diboride, ReB2 ReB2 can be synthesized by at least three different methods at standard atmospheric pressure: solid-state metathesis, melting in an electric arc, and direct heating of the elements. In the metathesis reaction, rhenium trichloride and magnesium diboride are mixed and heated in an inert atmosphere and the magnesium chloride byproduct is washed away. Excess boron is needed to prevent formation of other phases such as Re7B3 and Re3B. In the arc-melting method, rhenium and boron powders are mixed and a large electric current is passed through the mixture, also in an inert atmosphere. In the direct reaction method, the rhenium-boron mixture is sealed in a vacuum and held at a high temperature over a longer period (1000 ¬∞C for five days). At least the last two methods are capable of producing pure ReB2 without any other phases, as confirmed by X-ray crystallography.  Properties  The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure (see structure model), being greatest along the c axis. In contrast to the scratch hardness test, its indentation hardness (HV ~ 22 GPa) is much lower than that of diamond and is comparable to that of tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, titanium diboride or zirconium diboride. ReB2 slowly reacts with water, converting into a hydroxide. Two factors contribute to the high hardness of ReB2: a high density of valence electrons, and an abundance of short covalent bonds. Rhenium has one of the highest valence electron densities of any transition metal (476 electrons/nm3, compare to 572 electrons/nm3 for osmium and 705 electrons/nm3 for diamond). The addition of boron requires only a 5% expansion of the rhenium lattice, because the small boron atoms fill the existing spaces between the rhenium atoms. Furthermore, the electronegativities of rhenium and boron are close enough (1.9 and 2.04 on the Pauling scale) that they form covalent bonds in which the electrons are shared almost equally.

The author, L√º Jiamin, wrote the book under the pseudonym Jiang Rong; his true identity did not become publicly known until several years after the book's publication. Themes Wolf Totem is narrated by the main character, Chen Zhen, a Chinese man in his late twenties who, like the author, left his home in Beijing, China to work in Inner Mongolia during the Cultural Revolution.Jiang 2004 Through descriptions of folk traditions, rituals, and life on the steppe, Wolf Totem compares the culture of the ethnic Mongolian nomads and the Han Chinese farmers in the area. According to some interpretations, the book praises the \\"freedom, independence, respect, unyielding before hardship, teamwork and competition\\" of the former and criticizes the \\"Confucian-inspired culture\\" of the latter, which was \\"sheep- like\\". The book condemns the agricultural collectivisation imposed on the nomads by the settlers, and the ecological disasters it caused, and ends with a 60-page \\"call to action\\" disconnected from the main thread of the novel. The author has said he was inspired to begin writing Wolf Totem by accident: he ignored the advice of the clan chief of the group of nomads with whom he was staying, and accidentally stumbled across a pack of wolves. Terrified, he watched as the wolves chased a herd of sheep off a cliff, then dragged their corpses into a cave. From then on, fascinated by the wolves, he began to study them and their relationship with the nomads more closely, and even attempted to domesticate one. Marketing Wolf Totem exhibited strong sales almost immediately after its release, selling 50,000 copies in two weeks; pirated editions began to appear five days after the book first appeared on shelves. By March 2006, it had sold over four million copies in China, and had been broadcast in audiobook format in twelve parts during prime time on China Radio International. Jiang released a children's edition of the book in July 2005, cut down to roughly one-third the length. Despite the author's refusal to participate in marketing the book, deals for adaptations of the novel into other media and translations into other languages have set financial records. Penguin Books paid US$100,000 for the worldwide English rights, setting a record for the highest amount paid for the translation rights to a Chinese book; an unspecified Tokyo publisher paid US$300,000 for the rights to publish a manga adaptation, and Bertelsmann bought the German-language rights for ‚Ç¨20,000. The author has said that he believes that \\"in the West they may understand [my book] more fully\\" than in China. Other writers took advantage of the author's anonymity to write fake sequels to Wolf Totem, including two books titled Wolf Totem 2, as well as Great Wolf of the Plains,. all with the imprint of the Changjiang Arts Publishing House. As a result, in April 2007, the author issued a statement that denounced all such \\"sequels\\" as fraudulent; he indicated that he was doing research for another book, but would not be publishing anything new in the short term. Critical reaction Despite Jiang's stated refusal to attend any awards ceremonies or participate in any publicity, Wolf Totem has received more than 10 literary prizes, as well as other recognitions, including: *Named as one of the \\"Ten Best Chinese-language Books of 2004\\" by international newsweekly Yazhou Zhoukan *Nominee for the 2nd \\"21st Century Ding Jun Semiannual Literary Prize\\" in 2005 *Recipient of the first Man Asian Literary Prize, November 2007 Criticism Wolf Totem has also been the subject of criticism. Charu Nivedita, in his review in The Asian Age, called the novel fascist. He wrote, \\"Won‚Äôt we all prefer a peaceful desert to a fascist grassland where one dominating race devours all other in a macabre ritual of bloodbath?\\" German sinologist Wolfgang Kubin described the book as \\"fascist\\" for its depiction and treatment of the farmers. Pankaj Mishra, reviewing the English translation for The New York Times, described Jiang's writing as \\"full of set-piece didacticism.\\" The Mongol writer Guo Xuebo (), a scholar of Mongolian literature and history, has said that the wolf was never a traditional totem used by ethnic Mongolians; on the contrary, the wolf is the biggest menace for their survival. His post to this effect on Sina Weibo on 18 February 2015 was questioned by many others. On February 25, he wrote an open letter, condemning the novel and the film, saying they \\"humiliate the ancestry, distort the history and culture, and insult the Mongolian people.\\" Independent from his views, the wolf is a revered animal, which is regarded as having a heavenly destiny in Mongolia. On 20 January 2016, the Inner Mongolia Academy of Social Sciences (), the leading academic and research institution in Inner Mongolia, said that the wolf totem does not exist in ethnic Mongolian's belief. The institution found remains of ancient Mongolian totem worship in varying degrees among some tribes in ethnic Mongolia, but concluded there is no unified ethnic totem for Mongolian people after a wide range of fieldwork from April until July 2015 in Inner Mongolia. English translations *First edition: * Film adaptation Wolf Totem is a 2015 Chinese-language film based on the novel. Directed by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud who co-wrote with Alain Godard and John Collee, the Chinese-French co-production features a Chinese student who is sent to Inner Mongolia to teach shepherds and instead learns about the wolf population, which is under threat by a government apparatchik. The Beijing Forbidden City Film Corporation initially sought to hire a Chinese director, but filming humans with real wolves was considered too difficult. New Zealand director Peter Jackson was approached, but production did not take place. Annaud, whose 1997 film Seven Years in Tibet is banned in China, was hired despite the history. The film was produced by China Film Group and French-based Reperage. The French director, who had worked with animals on other films, acquired a dozen wolf pups in China and had them trained for several years by a Canadian animal trainer.

Together with ammonia, FAN makes up the measurement of yeast assimilable nitrogen that can be measured prior to the start of fermentation.K. Fugelsang, C. Edwards Wine Microbiology Second Edition pgs 16-17, 35, 115-117, 124-129 Springer Science and Business Media , New York (2010) The exact components of FAN will vary from composition of the wort or grape must. In wine, all 21 amino acids can be found in trace amounts with arginine, proline and glutamine being the most abundant. However, as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the primary yeast for both beer and wine, can not utilize proline in the anaerobic conditions of ethanol fermentation it is not included in FAN (and subsequently YAN) calculations. In winemaking The amount of FAN that winemakers will see in their grape much depends on a number of components including grape variety, rootstock, vineyard soils and viticultural practices (such as the use of fertilizers and canopy management) as well as the climate conditions of particular vintages. The typical wine grape will have anywhere from 22 to 1242 mg of nitrogen/liter derived from free amino acids. Sara E. Spayd and Joy Andersen-Bagge \\"Free Amino Acid Composition of Grape Juice From 12 Vitis vinifera Cultivars in Washington\\" Am. J. Enol. Vitic 1996 vol. 47 no. 4 389-402 In brewing For vigorous fermentation, a sufficient quantity of FAN must be present in the wort. An excessive concentration in the wort is not desirable however, as this may cause production of a significant quantity of fusel alcohols, or spoilage of the finished beer by other organisms.

Procedural time limits The Act establishes time limits for completing the various stages of federal criminal prosecution. The information or indictment must be filed within 30 days from the date of arrest or service of the summons.. Trial must commence within 70 days from the date the information or indictment was filed, or from the date the defendant appears before an officer of the court in which the charge is pending, whichever is later.. Moreover, in order to ensure that defendants are not rushed to trial without an adequate opportunity to prepare, Congress amended the Act in 1979 to provide a minimum time period during which trial may not commence.Speedy Trial Act Amendments of 1979, Pub. L. No. 96-43, Section 3, 93 Stat. 327. Thus, the Act provides that trial may not begin less than 30 days from the date the defendant first appears in court unless the defendant agrees in writing to an earlier date.. In United States v. Rojas- Contreras, 474 U.S. 231 (1985), the Supreme Court held that this 30-day trial preparation period is not restarted upon the filing of a substantially similar superseding indictment. If the indictment is dismissed at the defendant's request, the Act's provisions apply anew upon reinstatement of the charge.. If the indictment is dismissed at the request of the government, the 70-day clock is tolled during the period when no indictment is outstanding, and begins to run again upon the filing of the second indictment.. If the trial ends in a mistrial, or the court grants a motion for a new trial, the second trial must begin within 70 days \\"from the date the action occasioning the retrial becomes final.\\". =Delays that are not included in the Act= Certain pretrial delays are automatically excluded from the Act's time limits, such as delays caused by pretrial motions.. In Henderson v. United States, 476 U.S. 321, 330 (1986), the Supreme Court held that excludes \\"all time between the filing of a motion and the conclusion of the hearing on that motion, whether or not a delay in holding that hearing is 'reasonably necessary.'\\" The Act also excludes a reasonable period (up to 30 days) during which a motion is actually \\"under advisement\\" by the court.. Other delays excluded from the Act's time limits include delays caused by the unavailability of the defendant or an essential witness (); delays attributable to a co-defendant (); and delays attributable to the defendant's involvement in other proceedings, including delay resulting from an interlocutory appeal.. (Note, however, that the 30-day defense preparation period provided for in is calculated without reference to Section exclusions). A defendant may not expressly waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act.See, e.g., United States v. Saltzman, 984 F.2d 1087, 1090-1092 (10th Cir. 1993). However, if the trial judge determines that the \\"ends of justice\\" served by a continuance outweigh the interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, the delay occasioned by such continuance is excluded from the Act's time limits.. The judge must set forth, orally or in writing, his or her reasons for granting the continuance.. The Act provides a sanction of dismissal for violation of its time limits that may be with or without prejudice to reprosecution. In assessing whether dismissal should be with prejudice, the court must consider the seriousness of the offense, the circumstances leading to dismissal, and the impact that reprosecution would have on the administration of the Act and on the administration of justice.‚Äì. In United States v. Taylor, 487 U.S. 326 (1988), the Supreme Court held that a trial court must examine each statutory factor in deciding to dismiss charges with prejudice. The Court in Taylor found that a minor violation of the time limitations of the act that did not prejudice the defendant's trial preparation did not justify the dismissal with prejudice of an indictment charging serious drug offenses. While a defendant cannot unilaterally waive his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, he can forfeit his right to obtain a dismissal of the case for a claimed violation of the Act by failing to move for dismissal prior to trial. The statute provides that \\"[f]ailure of the defendant to move for dismissal prior to trial...shall constitute a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section.\\". Juvenile proceedings The Speedy Trial Act is inapplicable to juvenile delinquency proceedings, which have their own speedy trial provision.See (speedy trial provision of the Juvenile Delinquency Act) Furthermore, the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) provides its own time limits for persons incarcerated in other jurisdictions.See 18 U.S.C. Appendix 2, ¬ß 2, Articles III-VI. In such a case, the government must comply with both the time limits of the IAD and the Speedy Trial Act. Constitutional basis A defendant's right to a speedy trial has constitutional and statutory underpinnings in addition to the Speedy Trial Act. Federal statutes of limitations provide a time frame within which charges must be filed. Moreover, Rule of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, grants trial courts discretion to dismiss cases that are not brought to trial promptly.See Rule (b), Fed. R. Crim. P. (authorizing trial court to dismiss indictment if there is \\"unnecessary delay\\" in presenting the charge to a grand jury, in filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial). Even if a charge is brought within the period provided by the statute of limitations, a defendant may be able to show that preaccusation delay has violated his or her Fifth Amendment due process rights. To obtain a dismissal of the charges by reason of pre-indictment delay, a defendant has the burden of establishing that the government engaged in intentional delay to gain a tactical advantage, and that he suffered actual prejudice.United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783 (1977); United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971). A defendant's rights under the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment are triggered by \\"either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\\"United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 320 (1971). (As noted above, any delay before this time must be scrutinized under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, not the Sixth Amendment's Speedy Trial Clause.United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 7 (1982)). In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme Court set out a four-factor test for determining whether delay between the initiation of criminal proceedings and the beginning of trial violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. The test requires the court to consider the length of the delay, the cause of the delay, the defendant's assertion of his or her right to a speedy trial, and the presence or absence of prejudice resulting from the delay.Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. at 530-533. In United States v. Loud Hawk, 474 U.S. 302 (1986), where the reason for the 90-month delay (interlocutory appeals) did not weigh against the government, the Supreme Court held that the possibility of prejudice occasioned by the delay was not sufficient to establish a Sixth Amendment speedy trial violation. Moreover, the courts of appeals routinely reject Sixth Amendment speedy trial challenges in the absence of a showing of prejudice.See, e.g., United States v. Tannehill, 49 F.3d 1049, 1054 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 167 (1995); United States v. Baker, 63 F.3d 1478, 1497 (9th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 824 (1996). However, in Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647 (1992), the Supreme Court held that an \\"extraordinary\\" eight-and-one-half- year delay between the defendant's indictment and arrest, which resulted from the government's \\"egregious persistence in failing to prosecute [him],\\" violated his right to a speedy trial even in the absence of \\"affirmative proof of particularized prejudice.\\"Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. at 652, 655, 657. Where there are successive state and federal prosecutions, the general rule is that the federal constitutional speedy trial right does not arise until a federal accusation against the defendant is made. Thus, a prior state arrest based on the same facts as the subsequent federal charge does not implicate the federal constitutional guarantee.United States v. Walker, 710 F.2d 1062, 1069 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1005 (1984).

Plot A young female scam artist named Lupe collapses while participating in a Three-Card Monte scam on the street. She suffers from a lack of blood to the brain which temporarily paralyzed her ability to make decisions or exercise free will. Based on her background, Foreman immediately suspects Lupe's condition stems from drug abuse, while Chase looks for other possibilities. Lupe senses Foreman's disdain for the decisions she's made in her life, and Foreman grapples with his own humble past when his parents come to visit him. When Lupe's symptoms worsen and her organs begin to shut down, Foreman and the team suspect autoimmune disease to be the culprit. When treatment does not work, the team thinks it must be cancer. Foreman presses for a full-body radiation treatment. However, severe pain after the radiation leads the team to the final, correct diagnosis: an infection. The radiation treatment has destroyed Lupe's immune system and there is nothing anybody can do to save her. Foreman tells her the news and helps her cope with it. Meanwhile, Cuddy and Wilson go out on a date to see an art exhibit together after House asked Cuddy to go to a play with him and she declined. House probes Wilson's ex-wife about Wilson and his dating habits. Lupe eventually dies and when House performs an autopsy, he learns that she had a staph infection from a scratch due to her bra hook, and the team didn't notice it because the strap covered it. House feels disappointed by the patient's death; however, unlike Foreman, House feels that the team took an appropriate course of action, stating that their unconventional decision-making abilities make them better doctors. The episode ends with small talk between Foreman and his mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's. It is a bittersweet moment, as he realizes at the end of their conversation that she was not aware that he was her son. Foreman asks, \\"Do you know who I am, Mom?

The company, and Johnson, were ordered to pay $50 million in fines and penalties.https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900035269/judge-issues- dollar50m-judgment-against-abusive-utah-solar-scheme.html  Products  =Solar Power= Since 2004, International Automated Systems has put most of its efforts into developing a solar powered electricity generating system, based on solar heat collected by patented lenses and focused on a heat receiving system. This heat is then used to generate steam, which turns patented 'blade-less' turbines, and generates electricity. Prototypes of this system have been demonstrated at several locations. A fully functional electricity generation system has been under construction since 2005 in Delta, Utah. In 2018, IAUS was found guilty of operating an elaborate fraud scheme. The company's \\"solar lens\\" products were found to not produce any electricity, and were marketed mainly as a method to obtain tax credits. Judge David Nuffer wrote: that Neldon Johnson and his associates \\"knew or had reason to know that their statements about tax benefits purportedly related to buying the solar lenses were false or fraudulent.\\"https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900035269/judge-issues- dollar50m-judgment-against-abusive-utah-solar-scheme.html =Automated Retail= Some of the products or potential products of International Automated Systems include an automated retail self-service checkout system and management software for retail establishments. A demonstration project for this was a grocery store called U-Check that was built and run in Salem, Utah. Portions of International Automated Systems' technology have been licensed to Optimal Robotics for an undisclosed amount of money. However, Optimal Robotics Corporation previously had designed and implemented their own self-check out system, which they reported to have developed completely independently of International Automated Systems. A press release by Optimal Robotics on January 24, 2004 states: \\"Optimal Robotics Corp. (NASDAQ: OPMR), today announced that it has entered into a settlement agreement with International Automated Systems, Inc. (IAS), which brings to a close the patent lawsuit between the parties. In accordance with the agreement, IAS will receive a sum that is not considered to be material to Optimal.\\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-112640449.html =Biometrics and Fingerprint Identification= International Automated Systems developed a biometric device consisting of an automated fingerprint reader (AFIM = Automated Fingerprint Identification Machine) that was able to read a person's fingerprint, then use that information to create a specific, personalized code number, which could be stored in a small amount of digital space, such as on the magnetic strip of a credit card. People could then use other AFIM fingerprint scanners to identify themselves and purchase items or obtain access to controlled locations and devices in a secured way. =Other Products= The company currently is developing or has developed or partially developed products for airport security systems; automated restaurant systems; 'bladeless' turbines for electrical power generation; and solar technology systems for production of electricity and gasoline.

The agency started as Rochester Female Association for the Relief of Orphans and Destitute Children in 1837. The first year 46 children were served. The organization was renamed the Rochester Orphan Asylum in 1839, the organization constructed a larger facility in 1844 at Hubbell Park. In 1905 the group moved to the current Monroe Ave site. To reflect the shift from providing a home for orphans to caring for \\"dependent and neglected children,\\" the Rochester Orphan Asylum changed its name in 1921 to Hillside Home for Children. Another name change came in 1940 when Hillside Children's Center was adopted and a goal set: \\"for every child, a fair chance for the development of a healthy personality\\". During World War II Hillside Children's Center worked with Eastman Kodak to help the children of Kodak employees in England. Between 1940 and 1942, 156 British children were brought to the Rochester area by Kodak to safeguard them from the war in their home country. Hillside assisted in placing these \\"Kodakids,\\" as they were called, with the families of local Kodak employees or in foster homes for the duration of the war. In 1965, Hillside broadened its mission to helping \\"dependent, neglected, learning disabled, emotionally disturbed, socially maladjusted, and delinquent\\" children. During the 1970s, Hillside Children's Center experienced great growth. The institution began its conversion to a residential treatment center and reopened its campus school, which had been closed since 1931. In 1996 a new parent organization, Hillside Behavioral Health System (HBHS), was formed in order to provide services more efficiently and effectively. Hillside Children's Center and Hillside Children's Foundation served as partner affiliates. In 1996 the Wegmans Work Scholarship Connection joined Hillside to become Hillside Work Scholarship. In 1999, Hillside Behavioral Health System added to its family when Crestwood Children's Center and Crestwood Children's Foundation affiliated with it. Hillside Family of Agencies was adopted as the system name in December 2000 to better represent the diversity of services provided by each affiliate. In 2004 Hillside absorbed Snell Farms Children's Center and Adoption Resource Network, Inc. Headquartered in Rochester, New York, the organization works with youth and families facing a wide range of behavioral and emotional challenges. Hillside Family of Agencies employs more than 2,200 staff working out of multiple in New York and Maryland and Washington D.C.. 12,636 Families are served by HFA. Affiliates Hillside Family of Agencies comprises the following affiliates: *Crestwood Children's Center - Supports children ages birth through age 21 and their families with an array of child welfare, behavioral, mental health, and family development services. The main campus of Crestwood Children's Center is located near Rochester, New York. *Crestwood Children's Foundation - Raises funds to support the programs of Crestwood Children's Center. *Hillside Children's Center - Provides early intervention and customized services for children and families in Auburn, New York and Rochester, New York *Hillside Children's Foundation - Fund-raising for the Hillside Children's Center and Hillside Work-Scholarship Connection *Hillside Work-Scholarship Connection - Provides educational assistance and job training for young adults starting in grades 7-9 *Snell Farm Children's Center - Specialized residential treatment for boys, near Bath, New York Operating budget and funding The Hillside Family of Agencies operates on a total budget of $103 million (2006). It receives about 95% of its funds from government agencies for services provided, 1% from the United Way and 4% from other sources.Hillside Family of Agencies 2006 Annual Report AdaptaCare cottage A recent innovation is the AdaptaCare Cottage. This is a residential cottage design that adapts to the varying needs of service agencies. The cottage provides a home-like non-institutional look- and-feel in 6-, 8- and 10-bed designs, ranging in size from 3100 to over . It complies with the most stringent NYS requirements, including safety and security. Hillside Work Scholarship In 1987, Wegmans founded the Wegmans Work Scholarship Connection to teach at risk youth the skills they need to succeed and help reduce the high school dropout rate in the Rochester City School district. Wegmans provides part-time employment and workplace mentors for these students needing additional support. The program has a graduation rate of 80% while the standard Rochester City School District has a graduation rate of about 50%.

Ferber (January 30, 1923 - May 11, 2013) was an American feminist economist and the author of many books and articles on the subject of women's work, the family, and the construction of gender. She held a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. She was most noted for her work as co-editor with Julie A. Nelson of the influential anthology Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics and her book The Economics of Women, Men and Work, co-authored with Francine D. Blau and Anne Winkler. Highly regarded for her role as a central figure in the development of feminist economics, Ferber expanded the literature on women‚Äôs presence in the economy. She was one of the first people to confront Gary Becker‚Äôs work on economics and the family. Background Ferber was born in Czechoslovakia and received her B.A. at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada and her Ph.D. at the University of Chicago. Her husband, Robert Ferber, was hired by the University of Illinois to teach in the economics department in 1948, but strict nepotism rules at Illinois prevented her from being hired as a full-time professor. Yet the economics department did hire her on a semester-by-semester basis because of a severe teacher shortage. In 1971, she was promoted from lecturer to assistant professor. In 1979, she became a full professor.\\"Professor Marianne Ferber Honored.\\" 1994. Commerce InSight. Published three times a year by the University of Illinois Commerce Alumni Association and the Commerce Office of Publication. http://www.business.uiuc.edu/insight/fall94/ferber.html Career and awards Ferber was a professor of economics and served as head of women's studies (from 1979‚Äì1983 and 1991‚Äì1993) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign; subsequently a professor emerita. From 1993-1995, she was the Horner Distinguished Visiting Professor at Radcliffe College. She served as a professor of economics at the University of Illinois for 38 years. In the 1970s, she was a member of the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. Later, she became a founding member of the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) and in 1995 and 1996 served as IAFFE‚Äôs president.King, M.C. and L.F. Saunders. 1999. \\"An Interview with Marianne Ferber: founding feminist economist.\\" Review of Political Economy (11)1: 83:98. Also, she was the president of the Midwest Economic Association and received the McMaster University 1996 Distinguished Alumni Award for the Arts. Major publications In 1987, \\"Women and Work, Paid and Unpaid\\" was published, which is considered a comprehensive cataloging of economic research on women‚Äôs work before feminist economics emerged. In 1991, Ferber co-edited with Brigid O‚ÄôFarrell \\"Work and Families: Policies for a Changing Work Force.\\" Ferber and O‚ÄôFarrell address how more women have entered the work force, which results in both parents being employed. The result is that the burden on familial responsibilities and childcare must be readjusted if women are now entering the work force because work often conflicts with family duties, so employers must make adjustments in benefits, for example, to redress the changing situations of their employees. In 1993, the anthology \\"Beyond Economic Man: Feminist Theory and Economics\\" became one of the first tomes to compile work done by women and men who label themselves feminist economists and have an expressed interest in how women uniquely are impacted by economics. The overall conclusion from the compilation is that economics needs to remove itself from perpetuating masculine biases about how work must be done and to what extent certain work is valuable. In 1997, the third edition of \\"The Economics of Women, Men, and Work,\\" co-authored with Francine D. Blau and Anne Winkler, was published and is often used as a textbook and reference for how women have functioned in the economy and the role women have played in defining their own work while addressing gender issues in the family. = Selected excerpts = \\"Models of free individual choice are not adequate to analyze behavior fraught with issues of dependence, interdependence, tradition, and power.

Rear view of Rosenwald Mansion in Chicago (Nimmons & Fellows, 1903) Source:The Western Architect, January 1910 (15:1) George Croll Nimmons (June 8, 1865 - June 17, 1947) was an American architect. Nimmons was best known for his commercial work, which was primarily for Sears, Roebuck and Company, but he also designed several houses, including a Kenwood mansion for Sears' President, Julius Rosenwald. Early life A native of Wooster, Ohio, Nimmons attended the Academy there and later studied architecture in Europe. He was also a student at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Career In 1887 Nimmons was hired by the famous architectural firm of Burnham and Root where he served as a draftsman for 10 years. He partnered with William K. Fellows (1870-1948) in the late 1890s in the firm Nimmons & Fellows. During their partnership, Nimmons and Fellows designed a number of large commercial buildings in Chicago. In 1904 they were awarded what was very likely the largest single commission in the history of Chicago building up to that date. Sears, Roebuck and Co. selected them to design their warehouse, distribution and administrative center on West Arthington Avenue at Homan. It was said to be the largest mercantile establishment in the world at the time and was built in exactly 12 months, an amazing feat of construction. Nimmons and Fellows also designed branch buildings for Sears in several midwestern cities. Another result of the Nimmons and Fellows collaboration is the Dixon Building at 411 S. Wells. In 1910, Fellows formed a new firm with Dwight L. Perkins and John Hamilton. Nimmons‚Äô experience with warehouse design and construction brought him the commission for a large office and storage building for Reid, Murdoch and Co., built between 1912 and 1913 along the north bank of the Chicago River between Clark and LaSalle. The building is noteworthy because it conformed to Burnham‚Äôs Civic Plan and was the first attempt to make the riverside of a building attractive in Chicago. Until recently, this structure was leased to the city for municipal offices. Practicing on his own from 1910 to 1917 Nimmons also designed the Kimball Piano Company Building during this phase of his career. Working as the head of his own firm, George C. Nimmons and Co. (1917‚Äì33), Nimmons designed the American Furniture Mart at 680 N. Lake Shore Drive in 1923. In the final phase of his career, he was senior partner of Nimmons, Carr & Wright. Nimmons' numerous articles in leading architectural magazines expounded on his concept of industrial design and its impact on employees. =Selected buildings= *Sears, Roebuck and Company Administration Building (Nimmons & Fellows, 1905), (George C.

A phrase he said while encouraging people not to leave Georgia for the California Gold Rush, \\"There's gold in them thar hills\\", is commonly referenced in American popular culture. Stephenson wrote various articles on his observations of minerals, as well as mound excavations in Georgia. In the 1870s, several of his articles were published by the Smithsonian Institution, including Account of Ancient Mounds in Georgia and Mounds in Bartow County near Cartersville, Georgia. These described sites he visited and the artifacts found at each, such as mica mirrors, copper vessels, and quartz. He also published a major treatise in 1871 called Geology and Mineralogy of Georgia for which he is most famous. Other published works include a pamphlet Diamonds and Precious Stones in Georgia in 1878 and a historical sketch in 1866, Report on the Lewis Mine Property, White County, Georgia. He served as the assayer of the Dahlonega Mint in Dahlonega, Georgia in the 1840s. When the gold rush in Georgia was believed to be over, many miners headed west to join the 1849 California Gold Rush.

This bat can be found in several habitat types, including savanna, tropical moist forest, and fragmented and urban habitat. It roosts in trees, caves, and buildings in small colonies. This is a common species which is not considered to be threatened. The names Beccari's free-tailed bat or Beccari's mastiff bat once applied to populations in Australia. Taxonomy and etymology Ozimops beccarii was described as a new species in 1881 by German naturalist Wilhelm Peters. The eponym for the species name \\"beccarii\\" is Odoardo Beccari. Beccari discovered the holotype on Ambon Island of Indonesia. It was formerly considered native to Australia, but in 2014, the Australian population known as M. beccarii or M. beccarii astrolabiensis was distinguished as a full species, Mormopterus lumsdenae. Biology and ecology The species is known to roost in human structures such as houses. Additionally, it has been found in Melaleuca tree hollows; one individual was documented using a cave. Range and habitat Ozimops beccarii is found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It has been documented from above sea level. Conservation As of 2017, it is evaluated as a least-concern species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because its apparently preferred habitat is abundant; the species is likely widespread; and no major threats have been identified. It is infrequently encountered and known from only about twenty localities. The low number of records is likely a result of lack of survey effort in the region, however. Its population likely exceeds 10,000 individuals.

Tchaikovsky abandoned this work in 1892, only to reuse the first movement in the single-movement Third Piano Concerto, Op. 75, first performed and published after his death in 1895. Two other movements were reworked for piano and orchestra by Sergei Taneyev as the Andante and Finale, which was published as Tchaikovsky's Op. posth. 79 in 1897. Between 1951 and 1955, Soviet composer Semyon Bogatyrev reconstructed the symphony from Tchaikovsky's sketches and various re-workings. This version was premiered on February 7, 1957, in Moscow by the Moscow Region Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Mikhail Terian, and was published by the State Music Publishers in Moscow in 1961. It was first recorded by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy in 1962, soon after they gave the U.S. premiere of the work (February 16, 1962). Form The Bogatyrev reconstruction follows the traditional four- movement pattern: #Allegro brillante (in E-flat major) #:This movement was used for the Third Piano Concerto, Op. posth. 75. #Andante (in B-flat major) #:Bogatyryev used the Andante from the Andante and Finale for Piano and Orchestra, Op. posth. 79, which had been constructed from Tchaikovsky's sketches by Sergei Taneyev. More recently, it was reused as the slow movement of a projected Cello Concerto. #Scherzo: Vivace assai (in E-flat minor) #:Perceiving that Tchaikovsky would have written a scherzo for this symphony, Bogatyryev orchestrated this piece from Tchaikovsky's Scherzo-Fantaisie, Op. 72, No. 10. #Finale: Allegro maestoso (in E-flat major) #:Bogatyryev used the Finale from the Andante and Finale. Recordings Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra gave the American premiere on February 16, 1962, and made the first US recording for Columbia Records soon afterwards. The original LPs were released in stereo as MS 6349 and in mono as ML 5749. This recording was later digitally remastered and issued on CD.Eight other conductors have recorded it: Dmitri Kitayenko, Neeme J√§rvi, Sergei Skripka, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Mikhail Pletnev, Kyung-Soo Won, Kees Bakels, and Leo Ginzburg. The need to write ... \\"I literally cannot live without working,\\" Tchaikovsky once wrote to the Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, \\"For no sooner has some labor been completed ... there appears a desire to begin at once on some new labor.... [U]nder such circumstances this new labor is not always provoked by true creative necessity.\\"Alexander Pozansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man (New York: Schirmer Books, 1991), 552 By November 1889, Tchaikovsky's creative itch was becoming extreme. A year had passed since completing the Fifth Symphony, and eight months since writing another musical composition. Tchaikovsky confided to the Grand Duke that he had long aspired to crown his creative career with a grand symphony on some as yet undefined programme, but it was evidently on his return voyage from America in May 1891 that he jotted down a few preliminary ideas for what might become such a piece. More important still was a programme he roughed out, possibly at the same time: \\"The ultimate essence ... of the symphony is Life. First part ‚Äì all impulse, passion, confidence, thirst for activity. Must be short (the finale death ‚Äì result of collapse). Second part love: third disappointments; fourth ends dying away (also short).\\"David Brown, Tchaikovsky: The Final Years (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1992), 388 During the following months, while at work on The Nutcracker and Iolanta, he continued to note down further materials, but when at last he began systematic work on the piece, many of these and earlier ideas were discarded; nor was the programme to be used. Others were drawn in, however, and by June 8, 1892, both the first movement and the finale were fully sketched. He had hoped to continue work in July and August, but further composition was delayed until October. Nevertheless, by November 4, 1892 the entire symphony was sketched, and within three days the first movement was scored up to the recapitulation.Brown, 388 Tchaikovsky had already offered to conduct the premiere of the symphony at a charity concert in Moscow the following February. However, after another enforced break, the composer took another look at the sketches and experienced total disenchantment. \\"It's composed simply for the sake of composing something; there's nothing at all interesting or sympathetic in it,\\" he wrote to his nephew Vladimir \\"Bob\\" Davydov on December 16, 1892. \\"I've decided to discard and forget it ... Perhaps,\\" he added, though he can hardly have realized how precisely, \\"the subject still has the potential to stir my imagination.\\" Davydov's response came quickly and, to the composer's surprise, very strongly worded. In a letter dated December 19, 1892, Davydov wrote, \\"I feel sorry of course, for the symphony that you have cast down from the cliff as they used to do with the children of Sparta, because it seemed to you deformed, whereas it is probably as much a work of genius as the first five.\\"Alexander Poznansky, Tchaikovsky: The Quest for the Inner Man (New York: Schirmer Books, 1991), 553 ... vs. the need to express Tchaikovsky gave up on the symphony because he now found the music impersonal, lacking the introspection he felt a symphony needed. He had no wish to continue making, as he said, \\"meaningless harmonies and a rhythmical scheme expressive of nothing\\".Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, Tchaikovsky: The Man Behind the Music(New York: Dodd, Mead & Company), 356 However, Davydov's comments spurred Tchaikovsky to reuse the sketches instead of totally writing them off.Poznansky, 553 The music may have meant nothing to him on a personal level emotionally, but that did not mean it was worthless. The main theme was highly attractive, skillfully worked out, extroverted. When worked out by a composer whose handling of such a theme could become a delight to hear and, for the musicologist, to analyze, the results could become extremely worthwhile after all.Hanson and Hanson, 356 More importantly, the composer did not abandon the thought of writing a new symphony based on the program he conceived. Though his efforts with the E-flat symphony did not turn out as planned, they influenced his conception of what would become the 6th Symphony (Path√©tique), the first movement of which was fully sketched less than six weeks later, by 9 February 1893. By April 1893, Tchaikovsky had also decided to rescore the E-flat Symphony as a piano concerto, his third. In June he did preliminary work on this project, while simultaneously pushing ahead with work on the 6th Symphony. By August he had decided the concerto was too long, and he wrote to Alexander Siloti saying that he would publish just the first movement, under the title of Allegro de concert or Conzertstuck. The 6th symphony was finished by the end of August. On 6 October he wrote to Zygmunt Stojowski, \\"I am now working on the scoring of my new (third) concerto for our dear Di√©mer. When you see him, please tell him that when I proceeded to work on it, I realized that this concerto is of depressing and threatening length. Consequently I decided to leave only part one which in itself will constitute an entire concerto. The work will only improve the more since the last two parts were not worth very much\\". Three days later, in a letter to Bob Davydov (the dedicatee of the 6th Symphony), he again referred to the work as a concerto. By 15 October 1893 he had completely finished the recomposition. A note on the manuscript reads, \\"The end, God be thanked\\". But the last page was notated \\"End of movement 1\\", which has caused considerable speculation ever since. Had he decided that the 3rd Piano Concerto would have the usual three movements after all, but fate intervened before he could complete this work? The record favours the interpretation that he had decided on a single-movement concerto, despite the irregularity of this approach. Three weeks later, and only eight days after conducting the first performance of the 6th Symphony, which he had permitted after its premiere to be known as the Path√©tique, Tchaikovsky was dead. The one-movement Piano Concerto No. 3, Op. 75, Tchaikovsky's last completed composition, was published by Jurgenson the following year. It had its premiere in January 1895, with Sergei Taneyev as the soloist. After considerable discussion between 1894 and 1896 between Tchaikovsky's brother Modest, Taneyev, Siloti, the publisher Belyayev and others, it was decided that Taneyev would convert two of the E-flat Symphony's abandoned three remaining movements into piano- and-orchestra form, starting with the very brief sketches Tchaikovsky had made along these lines before deciding not to proceed beyond the first movement. The Andante and Finale was premiered in January 1897, again with Taneyev at the piano. It was published later that year by Belyayev as Tchaikovsky's Op. 79, even though it was arguably as much Taneyev's composition as Tchaikovsky's. The 3rd Piano Concerto and the Andante and Finale are sometimes played and recorded together to constitute a full three-movement piano concerto, even though this was almost certainly not Tchaikovsky's final intention.  Bogatyrev reconstruction  A reconstruction of the original symphony from the sketches and various reworkings was accomplished during 1951‚Äì1955 by the Soviet composer Semyon Bogatyrev, who brought the symphony into finished, fully orchestrated form and issued the score as Tchaikovsky's \\"Symphony No 7 in E-flat major.\\"Wiley, Roland. 'Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Il‚Ä≤yich, ¬ß6(ii): Years of valediction, 1889‚Äì93: The last symphony'; Works: solo instrument and orchestra; Works: orchestral, Grove Music Online (Accessed 7 February 2006), (subscription required). Brown, David. Tchaikovsky: the Final Years (1885-1893). New York: W.W. Norton, 1991, pp. 388-391, 497. Bogatyrev utilized primary sources, including Tchaikovsky's initial rough sketches, the full orchestral manuscript of about half of the first movement, and the manuscript and printed score of the 3rd Piano Concerto. The one-movement piano concerto was fully orchestrated by the composer, while the second and fourth movements were later orchestrated by Sergei Taneyev, Tchaikovsky's friend and fellow composer. While the first movement sketches and completed version for piano and orchestra were essentially complete, Bogatyrev found that only 81 of the 204 bars of the second movement were in Tchaikovsky's hand. Here he utilized Tchaikovsky's piano score for the Andante for Piano and Orchestra, Taneyev's orchestration, and a very rough draft by Tchaikovsky. For the third movement, Bogatyrev followed the insistence of the composer's brother Modest that this should be a scherzo, and orchestrated a scherzo from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 piano pieces, as well as more sketches by the composer. Remarkably, the piece fits neatly between the second and fourth movements and even includes final chords that are echoed by the beginning of the fourth movement. The reconstruction of the fourth movement was based on the piano score for the Finale for Piano and Orchestra, the composer's sketches, and the published orchestration by Taneyev.Liner notes for Columbia MS 6349  Tchaikovsky Fund reconstruction  In 2005, a second reconstruction of the symphony, commissioned by the Tchaikovsky Fund, was completed by Russian composer Pyotr Klimov. It had had its first public performance at the Tchaikovsky State House-Museum in Klin, near Moscow, by the Symphony Orchestra of Russia led by conductor Tomomi Nishimoto.

Holt Bridge is a parallel chord, three-span continuous, modified Warren-type truss bridge that carries Interstate 526 (I-526) over the Cooper River between Charleston and North Charleston. It was built in 1992 by the South Carolina Department of Transportation and was designed by HNTB Corporation. The bridge provides a connection between the communities east of the Cooper River, including Mount Pleasant and Daniel Island, to North Charleston and I-26. It is part of a major hurricane evacuation route for the area. The Don Holt Bridge is adjacent to a Kapstone (formerly MeadWestvaco) paper mill. In the mid 1980s, prior to construction of the bridge, owners of the mill filed a lawsuit to stop the bridge because the bridge deck would be at the same height as smokestacks from the mill. In certain weather conditions, the smokestacks produce a fog which could blind drivers and place the mill at risk for lawsuits from drivers. The lawsuit was settled by mandating that a road weather information system (RWIS) be included in the bridge project. The RWIS was designed to detect reduced visibility on the bridge and \\"to inform drivers of dense fog conditions, reduce traffic speeds, and guide vehicles safely through the fog-prone area.\\" The system uses variable-message signs and illuminating pavement lights (similar to a runway centerline lighting system). As of May 2003, there were no fog-related crashes.Goodwin, Lynette C. (May 2003), \\"Best Practices for Road Weather Management\\". Federal Highway Administration, Washington DC. p. 46-47.

Biography Francesco Stipo was born in Rome, Italy, in 1973. He studied law at La Sapienza University, where he won an Erasmus scholarship that allowed him to continue part of his studies in Jerez de la Fontera, Spain. While living in Spain he was the first man crossing the Straits of Gibraltar with a powered paraglider, on July 4, 1995. The event was reported in many Spanish newspapers including ABC, Diario de Jerez, Europa Sur and Italian magazines such as No Limits. In 1996 he won a scholarship from the Italian National Council of Research on the subject \\"juridical discipline of the outer space\\"; the thesis, entitled \\"La Definizione del Concetto Giuridico di Spazio Cosmico\\", was published in the Italian law journal Giurisprudenza di Merito. After obtaining a Ph.D. in International Law, in 2001 he moved to the United States where he obtained a master's degree (LLM) in comparative law from the University of Miami. Since 2002 he has been living in Miami, Florida; he has been working as a lawyer for European and American firms specializing in international business transactions. He fluently speaks 5 languages (English, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French) and has travelled extensively around the world.Stipo, Francesco. \\"About Francesco Stipo\\". Published works Dr. Stipo wrote books and articles published in Europe and the United States: The most important works are: 1) \\"World Federalist Manifesto. Guide to Political Globalization\\"Stipo, Francesco. World Federalist Manifesto. The book offers the reader a global and unitary vision of international organizations, giving insights on the inner mechanisms of the United Nations and a creative and constructive approach to the phenomenon of globalization. The book encompasses all social sciences, examining international issues by a technical prospective, analyzing the economic, political, financial and legal elements of globalization and offering solutions to international problems. The author focuses on the political aspects of globalization, examining the application of a confederate political model at world level while reviewing the historical background of world federalism. The author presents a model of world confederation divided in international legislative, executive, judicial and financial branches. The authority of the world government is shared with the Member States, in a way that both are sovereign within their respective sphere of competence. The world confederation, as envisioned by the author in the book, would not supersede the authority of the State governments but complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence; the book presents a political globalization where the economic balances of world nations are preserved at international level. The World Federalist Manifesto constitutes an important contribution to the progress of humanity and is directed to all people directly or indirectly involved in globalization. 2) \\"United Nations Reorganization. The Unification of the UN System\\" Stipo, Francesco. United Nations Reorganization. The Unification of the UN System. The book deals with the reform of the United Nations, introducing the idea of a unification of the UN system. The author proposes the creation of a voting system proportional to the level of contribution, applicable to all UN specialized agencies, which would allow the central executive body (for example, the Secretariat) to draw up a budget plan, which would allocate the international contributions among the different specialized agencies. The book proposes the unification of the specialized agencies under one single budget, and a single voting system; they would change their juridical nature from separated agencies to International Ministries or International Departments: becoming internal divisions of the United Nations, their general policy would be directed by the Secretary General. 3) \\"The Reform of the Budget and the Administration of the United Nations. The Balanced Contribution Theory and the Introduction of an Income- Based Contribution System to the International Organizations\\" Stipo, Francesco. The Balanced Contribution Theory. The book analyzes the main current issues of the international organizations: it examines the impact of United Nations]contributions on nations‚Äô budget and tax rates, the economic cost of the fragmentation of the United Nations system in different specialized agencies and the risk of stall of the Security Council. The result of the analysis empirically demonstrates the adverse effects of international contributions on national budgets, due to the lack of balance between national income and the criteria of nations‚Äô contribution to the UN, the World Trade Organization, the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund. The book shows the benefits of a greater voting power of developed countries, like the United States, in international organizations through the adoption of an income-based contribution system which balances nations‚Äô voting power with the level of Member States‚Äô national income. Francesco Stipo has also published articles in European law journals: 1) \\"Disciplina del Sistema Globale di Navigazione Satellitare\\", published in Spain, in Revista Europea de Derecho de la Navegaci√≥n Mar√≠tima y Aeron√°utica, ISSN 1130-2127, N¬∫ 14, 1998, 1891-1906 Stipo, Francesco.

Pathan made his debut in first-class cricket in 2001/02. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-arm offbreak bowler. His younger brother Irfan Pathan is also an Indian cricketer. Personal life Yusuf Pathan was born in Baroda, Gujarat, to a Gujarati Pathan family. He is the elder brother of Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan. He along with his brother has done philanthropic work during covid 19 by distributing Masks.Yusuf married Mumbai-based physiotherapist, Afreen who gave birth to a baby boy on 17 April 2014. He had been supporting \\"YAIF\\" and its mission \\"Youth Against Rape\\". Career Following his impressive performances in the 2007 Deodhar Trophy and the Inter-state domestic Twenty20 competition held in April 2007, Pathan was made a part of the Indian squad for the inaugural Twenty20 World Championship, held in South Africa in September 2007. He made his Twenty20 international debut in the final against Pakistan. He opened the batting for India in the match, and scored 15 runs in the process. Following his good showing in the IPL, he was selected for the Indian one-day team. After IPL, though he played all the games in the Kitply Cup and Asia Cup, he got to bat only four times and could not perform well with both bat and ball. He was later dropped from the series against Sri Lanka. He performed well in domestic circuit and impressed the selectors and was selected for the England ODI series in November. He scored a fifty off just 29 balls in the second ODI against England in Indore, on his 26th birthday. Yusuf had made his One Day International debut for India against Pakistan in Dhaka on 10 June 2008. He became a regular feature of the national One Day International team, but is yet to make his test debut. Even though Pathan could not repeat his first IPL performance in the second season, he was selected in the Indian team to play the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 championships in England. In the second of India's Super 8 matches, he made an unbeaten 33 from 17 balls against England. Despite his knock, the team lost the game and crashed out of the tournament without making it to the semi- finals. His rare international debut came in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 in 2007. In late 2009, Pathan was dropped from the limited overs team after a series of unproductive performances. In the final of the 2010 Duleep Trophy cricket tournament, Pathan scored a hundred in the first innings and a double hundred in the second and led his team West Zone to a three wicket win over South Zone. Pathan made 108 in the first innings and an unbeaten 210 from 190 balls in the second innings to help his team chase down a mammoth target of 536. This became a world record for the highest successful run chase in first-class cricket history. On 7 December 2010, Pathan's power hitting sealed a memorable 5-wicket win for India. Pathan clobbered the New Zealand attack with his aggressive innings, smashing an unbeaten 123 from 96 balls and shared an unbroken 133-run partnership with Saurabh Tiwary to guide India to a huge target of 316 with seven balls to spare and give the hosts a 4‚Äì0 lead in the series. He was named man of the match for this effort. The all-rounder clubbed seven fours and seven sixes on the way to his maiden one-day century to help the hosts overhaul New Zealand's challenging 315‚Äì7 with seven balls to spare at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. At the awards distribution ceremony he stated that \\"this knock will boost my career\\". Indian captain Gautam Gambhir said \\"I have always said Pathan can finish games on his own, and that's what he did today, I had never seen something like this before. But I knew till the time Pathan was there, we would win the game.\\" New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori said \\"It was a great game of cricket, we were in the game, but Pathan was pretty amazing and took the game away from us.\\" In the MTN ODI series against South Africa, before the 2011 World Cup, he gave a stand-out performance in a match in Pretoria where he scored a brilliant 105 in 70 deliveries (comprising 8 fours and 8 sixes). Even though India lost the match, his performance was complimented heavily. During this knock, he reached his century off 68 balls which is the sixth-fastest by an Indian and the second-fastest by an Indian outside the subcontinent. Thanks to his stream of good performances, he made it to the Indian team for 2011 World Cup, and also scored 100 for just 37 balls vs Mumbai Indians in IPL 2010. Though Yusuf did not have a great World Cup, he ended up having the winner's medal and the honor of holding the World Cup aloft. He was named in the Indian team for 2012 Asia Cup to be held in Bangladesh. He featured in the triangular series in Nairobi-Kenya and played for Baroda's team against Gujarat and Kenya international where he was honoured by a local fan who said \\"Yusuf the number one player in cricket after the great Sachin Tendulkar.\\" Indian Premier League After a good domestic season in 2007/08, he was signed by the Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League for US$265,000 (INR 1.9 crore). In the 2008 IPL season, he scored 435 runs and took 8 wickets. He recorded the season's fastest half-century (from 21 balls) against the Deccan Chargers, and was also the Man of the Match in the final against the Chennai Super Kings.

The innings also included 11 consecutive hits to the boundary (6, 6, 6, 6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 4, 4). After that knock where he scored the fastest IPL century, his Rajasthan Royals skipper Shane Warne described his innings as one of the best innings he has even seen in his career and also compared Yusuf Pathan with his country-mate Andrew Symonds as two of the cleanest hitters of the ball. In the 2011 IPL auction, he was bought for $2.1 million by Kolkata Knight Riders and was retained by the Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 3.25 crores via the 'Right to Match' option in the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction 2014.http://www.cricketcountry.com/news/ipl-7-auction-yusuf-pathan-retained- by-kolkata-knight-riders-for-rs-3-25-crore-96537 On 15 May 2013, Yusuf Pathan became the first batsman to be given out for obstructing the field in Twenty20 cricket while playing for the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL 2013 against Pune Warriors India.

The company operates more than 50 offices, serving clients worldwide. The company has expertise in structural engineering, fa√ßade engineering, forensics, renewal, construction engineering, property loss consulting, sustainability, applied science, protective design and transportation. The engineering firm provided the structural design for several of the world's tallest building structures, including the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Taipei 101 in Taiwan. Other structures designed by the firm include Soldier Field in Chicago, Petco Park in San Diego, and the Minneapolis Public Library in Minneapolis. Among other architects of note, Thornton Tomasetti has collaborated with Cesar Pelli, Santiago Calatrava, Renzo Piano, and Rafael Vinoly. Thornton Tomasetti works to advance sustainable design and construction practices. About one-fifth of its staff are LEED accredited professionals (LEED AP).

Thornton and Richard Tomasetti purchased Lev Zetlin & Associates (LZA) from Gable Industries, to which Lev Zetlin had sold LZA in 1971. Thornton Tomasetti immediately began to branch out and enter the highrise market with several innovative designs. =New York City office= The New York City office essentially began in 1956 as Lev Zetlin & Associates (LZA), founded by Lev Zetlin upon the completion of his PhD at Cornell University. Zetlin pioneered the use of the double layer bicycle wheel roof system used in the Utica Civic Auditorium (also known as the Utica Memorial Auditorium), as well as the hyperbolic (hypar) roofs used in American Airlines 747 super- hangars at airports in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Lev Zetlin also embraced the creative use of materials, most notably demonstrated in a bridge design made entirely of paper products for an International Paper ad.http://www.uticaod.com/x293547804/Aud-history-The-50s-and-60s =Chicago office= Eli Cohen In 1993, Thornton Tomasetti acquired Cohen-Barreto- Marchertas (CBM) and created a Chicago office. Founded in 1965 by Eli Cohen, CBM pioneered the use of the now-common composite steel structural system, which combines a reinforced concrete core wall (to resist lateral loads) with a light steel floor framing. The development of 50- to 60-story buildings became more feasible and efficient because the lighter framing reduced construction time and expense, and allowed for large, column-free spans, giving architects greater freedom in exterior expression. In the early 1960s, Cohen's adaptation of the concrete cooling tower design to high-rise offices required a change in the way the unions worked. Until that time, ironworker contracts forbid members of other trades to work at higher elevations at job sites. But the proposed system was reviewed with them and they agreed to let concrete workers work above them.

Taxonomy  The taxonomy of the Mormopterus species has been a complicated issue for some time. Originally described by Wilhelm Peters in 1881,Peters, W. (1881). √úber die Chiropterengattung Mormopterus und die dahin geh√∂rigen Arten. Monatsberichte Preussische Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin 1881, 482‚Äì485. it was understood even then that the species was a complex. Though there have been many alterations, M. planiceps has officially been a species since 1906. The most recent and currently accepted description of the species is by Reardon et al. (2014). It is thought that the complex is a result of the species being polyphyletic, where presented phenotypes appear the same but do not result from common ancestors. Texts may refer to this species as 'Mormopterus Species 4'. There are 6 undescribed species in the genus. Species 4 generally refers to the southern free-tailed bat, although it has been separated into eastern and western populations at times. The type locality is Sydney, the capital of New South Wales, although authors have attributed various localities as the origin of the type specimen used in the first description; the type has also be allocated to Western Australia (Iredale & Troughton, 1934). Common names include the little mastiff bat and southern free-tailed bat.  Description  Identifying this species can be difficult, as the main features used in clarifying the species complex were genetic (using allozyme alleles). Morphological attributes that aid in identification are forearm length, mass and colouring however there are a number of similar species in the genus, such as M. petersi. The colouring differs between ventral and dorsal fur; dorsal and head fur are uniform in colour and ranging light brown to grey-brown. Ventral fur is generally lighter with fur ranging from white at the base, light brown in the midsection, and lighter at the ends. Other descriptive features include wrinkled lips, triangular ears, and as the name suggests, a tail that extends largely past the tail membrane. M. planiceps can be differentiated from similar species by such physical details as nostril spacing. Its most telling external feature is the phallus. This species possess the largest glans penis of the genus Mormopterus, on average greater than 9 mm and of a distinctive shape. The species also possesses a flattened skull and a uniquely angled and sized pre- molar.  Distribution and habitat  The southern free-tailed bat occurs in most of south-east Australia including New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, extending into South-west Western Australia and along the east coast to Queensland. It is also found in New Guinea. The species is found across a number of vegetation types including mallee, shrubland, open forest and woodland, with a preference for wetter environments. It has adapted well to fragmentation and is able to dwell around cities and towns. M. planiceps can roost in tree hollows and man-made cavities such as sheds and barns. They have not been found in caves even where these are available. Populations can contain up to 100 individuals, with an average of 30-40 females in a roost and smaller groups for males (these can be as small as 3-4 individuals). This species can be quite tolerant of roosting with other species and will often share roosts.  Diet and Foraging  Like all Molosidae, the southern free- tailed bat is an insectivore. It uses echolocation to locate its insect prey and feeds in or above the open canopy, also taking advantage of gaps in trees (including edges and roads). It is agile enough to forage on the ground, although it may not be able to take off from ground level and will generally climb upwards a metre or two before taking flight. The species has been known to eat a variety of different insects, including moths, various beetles and Hymenoptera. Diet is dependent on region and habitat. In Victoria they have been found to feed on the Rutherglen bug (Nysius vinitor) which is considered an agricultural pest.  Reproduction  Females are monotocous, producing one young each summer. Conception occurs from the end of winter to the beginning of spring. Sexual maturity is achieved for females within a year of birth. Females were found to be able to store sperm for up to two months to conceive during optimal times; a characteristic unknown in other species of mollossidae. Insemination occurs anywhere from autumn to spring. The exact gestation time is unknown.  Conservation  The IUCN currently classifies the southern free-tailed bat as Least concern due to its wide distribution and common occurrence, although population numbers appear to be declining in certain locations.

The home was constructed by John Craighead in 1818 across the street from the William Blount Mansion.Stanley Folmsbee and Susan Hill Dillon, \\"Blount Mansion: Tennessee's Territorial Capitol.\\" Tennessee Historical Quarterly Vol. 22, no. 1 (March 1963), pp. 107, 120-121. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Craighead family lived in the house until 1855, when it was sold to William Swan. Swan, who later was a member of the Confederate Congress, soon sold the house to George Jackson. The George Jackson family then lived in the home until around 1885. The state of Tennessee and the City of Knoxville purchased the property in 1957 and heavily modified it, before transferring it to the Blount Mansion Association in 1962. From 1966 to the mid-1990s, the house served as the Blount Mansion visitors center and offices, until it was replaced in this function by a purpose-built visitors center. Subsequently, it was used as archival storage and for occasional special events. In September 2020, a $75,000 grant was obtained to allow for a restoration expected to take 12-18 months, with completion predicted in the fall of 2021.https://www.wvlt.tv/2020/09/01/historic-knoxville-house-to-be-restored- after-receiving-75k-grant/ Location The Craighead‚ÄìJackson House is situated at the corner of West Hill Avenue and State Street in downtown Knoxville. The house's back porch overlooks the confluence of First Creek and the Tennessee River to the southeast. The river's Volunteer Landing waterfront lies at the base of the embankment to the south and southwest. History Rear facade of the Craighead‚ÄìJackson House After William Blount selected White's Fort as the capital of the newly created Southwest Territory in 1791, the fort's owner, James White, and his son-in-law Charles McClung drew up a grid of 64 half-acre lots that would eventually become the core of the city of Knoxville. The Craighead‚ÄìJackson House is located on what was originally designated \\"Lot 15\\" on McClung's grid. Lot 15 was sold to William Blount in October 1791, although Blount eventually disposed of the lot and instead built his mansion on the adjacent lot (Lot 18) which he purchased from John Carter in 1794. Tennessee historian Stanley Folmsbee suggested that the Blount family's temporary cabin (where they lived while the mansion was being built) may have been located at Lot 15, rather than on the Hill, as local history has long dictated. The Craighead‚ÄìJackson House, photographed by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1934 John Craighead (1783-1826) purchased Lot 15 in 1818 and built the current house. Craighead served as a Knoxville city alderman in 1824,East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (editor), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), p. 635. was an elder of the First Presbyterian Church, and is buried in the First Presbyterian Church Cemetery. George Jackson, a Knoxville physician, obtained the house in the late 1850s. According to a local legend, the house is haunted by the ghost of one of Jackson's servants, who burned to death after her skirt caught fire while working in the house's kitchen.Don Akers, The Ghost of Craighead‚ÄìJackson House .

In the 1950s, the Blount Mansion Association, which had restored Blount Mansion in the 1930s, expressed interest in acquiring the Craighead‚ÄìJackson House. In 1957, the house was offered to them for $15,000. The state of Tennessee offered to pay half the cost if a Knoxville resident or residents would pay the other half. The City of Knoxville subsequently paid the other half, and in 1962 transferred the house to the Blount Mansion Association with the stipulation that it be used and that restoration begin within six months. The Association set up a display of pioneer relics at the house in the late 1960s, and used the house for its offices until it moved to a new office on Gay Street.East Tennessee Community Design Center, Blount Mansion Campus Master Plan , 2007.

The novel attempts to depict the harsh reality of slavery. Due to the weak copyright laws at the time, a number of unauthorized plays based on the novel were staged for decades, many of them mocking the novel's strong characters and social message, and leading to the pejorative term \\"Uncle Tom\\". Even though Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best- selling novel of the 19th century, far more Americans of that time saw the story in a stage play or musical than read the book.\\"People & Events: Uncle Tom's Cabin Takes the Nation by Storm\\" Stephen Foster, The American Experience, PBS, accessed April 19, 2007. Some of these shows were essentially minstrel shows that utilized caricatures and stereotypes of black people, and thus inverting the intent of the novel. \\"Tom shows\\" were popular in the United States from the 1850s through the early 1900s.  The shows  Stage plays based on Uncle Tom's Cabin--\\"Tom shows\\"--began to appear while the story itself was still being serialized. These plays varied tremendously in their politics--some faithfully reflected Stowe's sentimentalized antislavery politics, while others were more moderate, or even pro-slavery.Lott, Eric. Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class. New York: Oxford University Press, 1993. . The information on \\"Tom shows\\" comes from chapter 8: Uncle Tomitudes: Racial Melodrama and Modes of Production, pp. 211‚Äì233 A number of the productions also featured songs by Stephen Foster, including \\"My Old Kentucky Home,\\" \\"Old Folks at Home,\\" and \\"Massa's in the Cold Ground.\\" Stowe herself never authorized dramatization of her work, because of her puritanical distrust of drama (although she did eventually go to see George Aiken's version, and, according to Francis Underwood, was \\"delighted\\" by Caroline Howard's portrayal of Topsy). Asa Hutchinson of the Hutchinson Family Singers, whose antislavery politics closely matched those of Stowe tried and failed to get her permission to stage an official version; her refusal left the field clear for any number of adaptations, some launched for (various) political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures. Eric Lott, in his book Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class, estimates that at least three million people saw these plays, as many as the novel's worldwide sales. Some of these shows were basically just blackface minstrel shows only loosely based on the novel, and their grossly exaggerated caricatures of black people further perpetuated, for purposes of mockery, some of the stereotypes that Stowe had used more innocently.  Productions  Eliza crossing the ice, in an 1881 theater poster for a production by the Jarrett & London Company and Slavin's Original American Troupe. All \\"Tom shows\\" appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy. The first serious attempt at anything like a faithful stage adaptation was a one-hour play by C.W. Taylor at Purdy's National Theater (New York City); it ran for about ten performances in August- September 1852 sharing a bill with a blackface burlesque featuring T.D. Rice. Rice, famous in the 1830s for his comic and clearly racist blackface character Jim Crow, later became the most celebrated actor to play the title role of Tom; when Rice opened in H.E. Stevens play of Uncle Tom's Cabin in January 1854 at New York's Bowery Theatre, the Spirit of the Times' reviewer described him as \\"decidedly the best personator of negro character who has appeared in any drama.\\" The best-known \\"Tom Shows\\" were those of George Aiken and H.J. Conway. Aiken's original Uncle Tom's Cabin focused almost entirely on Little Eva (played by child star Cordelia Howard); a sequel, The Death of Uncle Tom, or the Religion of the Lonely told Tom's own story. The two were ultimately combined in an unprecedented evening-long six-act play. According to Lott, it is generally faithful to Stowe's novel, although it plays down the trickster characters of Sam and Andy and variously adds or expands the roles of some farcical white characters instead. It also focuses heavily on George Harris; the New York Times reported that his defiant speech received \\"great cheers\\" from an audience of Bowery b'hoys and g'hals. Even this most sympathetic of \\"Tom shows\\" clearly borrowed heavily from minstrelsy: not only were the slave roles all played by white actors in blackface, but Stephen Foster's \\"Old Folks at Home\\" was played in the scene where Tom is sold down the river. After a long and successful run beginning November 15, 1852 in Troy, New York, the play opened in New York City July 18, 1853, where its success was even greater. Conway's production opened in Boston the same day Aiken's opened in Troy; P.T. Barnum brought it to his American Museum in New York November 7, 1853. Its politics were much more moderate. Sam and Andy become, in Lott's words, \\"buffoons\\". Criticism of slavery was placed largely in the mouth of a newly introduced Yankee character, a reporter named Penetrate Partyside. St. Clare's role was expanded, and turned into more of a pro-slavery advocate, articulating the politics of a John C. Calhoun. Legree rigs the auction that gets him ownership of Tom (as against Stowe's and Aiken's portrayal of oppression as the normal mode of slavery, not an abuse of the system by a cheater). Beyond this, Conway gave his play a happy ending, with Tom and various other slaves freed. Showmen felt that Stowe's novel had a flaw in that there was no clearly defined comic character, so there was no role for a comedian, and consequently little relief from the tragedy. Eventually it was found that the minor character of Marks the Lawyer could be played as a broad caricature for laughs, dressing him in foppish clothes, often equipped with a dainty umbrella. Some productions even had him make an entrance mounted astride a pig.  Diluting the message of Stowe's book  \\"Tom shows\\" were so popular that there were even pro-slavery versions. Among the most popular was Uncle Tom's Cabin as It Is: The Southern Uncle Tom, produced in 1852 at the Baltimore Museum. Lott mentions numerous \\"offshoots, parodies, thefts, and rebuttals\\" including a full-scale play by Christy's Minstrels and a parody by Conway himself called Uncle Pat's Cabin, and records that the story in its many variants \\"dominated northern popular culture‚Ä¶ for several years\\". According to Eric Lott, even those \\"Tom shows\\" which stayed relatively close to Stowe's novel played down the feminist aspects of the book and Stowe's criticisms of capitalism, and turned her anti-slavery politics into anti- Southern sectionalism. Francis Underwood, a contemporary, wrote that Aiken's play had also lost the \\"lightness and gayety\\" of Stowe's book. Nonetheless, Lott argues, the plays increased sympathy for the slaves among the Northern white working class (which had been somewhat alienated from the abolitionist movement by its perceived elitist backing).  Influence  The influence of the \\"Tom shows\\" can be found in a number of plays from the 1850s: most obviously, C.W. Taylor's dramatization of Stowe's Dred, but also J.T. Trowbridge's abolitionist play Neighbor Jackwood, Dion Boucicault's The Octoroon, and a play called The Insurrection, based on John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. Still from Edwin S. Porter's 1903 version of Uncle Tom's Cabin, which was one of the first \\"full length\\" movies. The still shows Eliza telling Uncle Tom that she has been sold and that she is running away to save her child. The influence of the \\"Tom shows\\" also carried over into the silent film era (with Uncle Tom's Cabin being the most-filmed story of that time period).Uncle Tom's Cabin on Film, Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007. This was due to the continuing popularity of both the book and \\"Tom shows,\\" meaning audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot, making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words. Several of the early film versions of Uncle Tom's Cabin were essentially filmed versions of \\"Tom shows.\\" These included: * A 1903 version of Uncle Tom's Cabin, which was one of the earliest \\"full- length\\" movies (although \\"full-length\\" at that time meant between 10 and 14 minutes).The First Uncle Tom's Cabin Film: Edison-Porter's Slavery Days (1903), Uncle Tom's Cabin and American Culture, a Multi-Media Archive, accessed April 19, 2007. This film, directed by Edwin S. Porter, used white actors in blackface in the major roles and black performers only as extras. This version was similar to many of the \\"Tom Shows\\" of earlier decades and featured a large number of black stereotypes (such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction). *Another film version from 1903 was directed by Siegmund Lubin and starred Lubin as Simon Legree.

The Children's Hospital Critical Care Transport Service is the only service of its kind outside of St. Louis and Kansas City. The service cares for children of all ages from premature infants to adolescents. The 26-member Children's Hospital transport team is composed of registered nurses, respiratory therapists, neonatologists and pediatric intensivists who are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ambulance team, consisting of an emergency medical technician, respiratory therapist, and registered nurse, responds to any hospital request in Missouri by both ground and air. History In 1972, physicians from Columbia Orthopaedic Group joined with a number of other physicians from around Columbia to build Columbia Regional Hospital. Construction began after the land was purchased on February 7, 1972, and the new Columbia Regional Hospital and orthopedic clinic to the south opened in 1974. Columbia Orthopedic Group leased the 265-bed facility to Medenco, which later became Lifemark Corp. Ten years later, Lifemark purchased the hospital and then sold it to American International Hospital Corp., which in turn became Tenet Healthcare Corporation. In 1999 University of Missouri Health Care purchased Columbia Regional Hospital from Tenet Healthcare for $34.55 million. =Change to Women's and Children's Hospital= In September 2010, University of Missouri Children's Hospital moved to the Columbia Regional Hospital and the name was officially changed to University of Missouri Women's and Children's Hospital. More than $12 million was spent to renovate the former building including the construction of two new entrances, one child-friendly and one specifically for women.

Biography Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, (WKDA Nashville Interview, Late 1970s) Talley is an artist whose vision of the American experience, as author David McGee has said is \\"startlingly original.\\" As a youth, Talley's family moved from their home in Mehan, Oklahoma, near Stillwater, to Washington state, where his father worked as a chemical operator in the Hanford plutonium factory. After five years in Richland, Washington, and realizing the hazards his father's employment presented, the family relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Talley graduated from the University of New Mexico with a degree in fine arts. After college, encouraged by Pete Seeger while on a trip to New Mexico, Talley began to write songs that drew upon the culture of the Southwest. These early songs eventually became The Road to Torre√≥n, a saga of life and death in the Chicano villages of northern New Mexico. Released in a boxed edition by Bear Family Records in 1992, it was a collaboration of photography and music, with a photographic essay contributed by Talley's lifelong friend, photographer Cavalliere Ketchum. In 1968, Talley moved from New Mexico to Nashville, Tennessee to try to get his songs released. Over the years Johnny Cash, Johnny Paycheck, Gene Clark, Alan Jackson, Hazel Dickens, and most recently Moby, have recorded his songs. His album Got No Bread, No Milk, No Money, But We Sure Got a Lot of Love was released during an era when outlaw country was gaining ground in Nashville. Joining country music and the blues, B. B. King, played his first Nashville session with Talley in 1976, as his lead guitar player. Talley's recording career now spans over thirty years. John Hammond, Sr. at Columbia Records in New York was his first mentor, and championed his writing in the early 1970s. When Hammond could not get Talley signed to Columbia, he sent him to Jerry Wexler, who was starting a new Nashville operation with his Atlantic label at the time. Wexler signed Talley to his first recording contract at Atlantic Records. Atlantic's Nashville operation, however, did not do well at the time and Atlantic closed its Nashville office. Talley then moved to Capitol Records where he released four albums during the mid-1970s: Got No Bread, No Milk, No Money, But We Sure Got a Lot of Love (1975); Tryin‚Äô Like The Devil (1976); Blackjack Choir (1977) and Ain't It Somethin‚Äô (1977). Rolling Stone, and other music publications, have declared these albums American classics for their time. During the 1980s and 1990s, Talley recorded four albums, which were released in Europe by the German Bear Family Records, American Originals (1985); and Love Songs and The Blues (1989); The Road To Torre√≥n (1992) and James Talley: Live (1994). In 1999, Talley started his own artist's label, Cimarron Records, and released Woody Guthrie and Songs of My Oklahoma Home (2000), his only album that covered someone else's songs; Nashville City Blues, (2000), and was named Amazon.com's Folk Artist of the Year 2000. In 2002, Touchstones was released ‚Äì a fresh retrospective of the songs from his early career. It was recorded in Texas with the help of Talley's old friends, Joe Ely and Ponty Bone. In 2004 Journey was released, a live recording made on his tour of Italy. It displayed some of his classics as well as five new compositions. In February 2006, Talley's debut album, Got No Bread, No Milk, No Money, But We Sure Got a Lot of Love was reissued in a special 30th anniversary edition. In July 2008, Talley simultaneously issued two CDs in digital download, Journey: The Second Voyage, the remaining songs for the original live Journey recordings, supplemented with five new songs, and Heartsong, an album of fifteen new songs and a re-recording of his song \\"She's The One,\\" which was covered as \\"Evening Rain\\" by Moby.

It was formed on 25 November 1943, under the administrative umbrella organization of the Yugoslav Partisans, AVNOJ and declared Bosnia and Herzegovina to be an equal community of Muslims (Bosniaks), Serbs, and Croats. Its president was Vojislav Kovaƒçeviƒá. History ZAVNOBiH held three sessions: the first in Mrkonjiƒá Grad on 25 November 1943 (now celebrated as National Day, but only within the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, as Republika Srpska entity leaders deny the event's historical importance.), second in Sanski Most, on 30 June 1944, the third, and last in Sarajevo, 26 April 1945. The first ZAVNOBiH session began at 7 p.m. and ended at 4 o'clock the morning. This inaugural meeting was attended by 247 delegates from all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, of which 173 had voting rights. ZAVNOBiH was formally constituted as a General Policy Representation of People's Liberation Movement of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but in reality and practice acted as its highest authority. The delegates adopted a resolution ZAVNOBiH Proclamation and peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the statement that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its people at home and abroad, may represent the only ZAVNOBiH and AVNOJ. The documents at the same time expressed the determination of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina that their country, which is neither Serbian nor Croatian, nor Muslim (Bosniak), but Serbian and Croatian and Muslim, is a brotherhood community in which they will be provided with full equality of all Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats. The session also elected a delegation of 58 members to represent Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Second Session of AVNOJ (29 November 1943). At the same time constituted the Presidency ZAVNOBiH, composed of 31 members, with Dr. Vojislav Kecmanoviƒá doctor from Bijeljina, as president. Embodied in the People's Liberation Committees and ZAVNOBiH are: #Equality between Serbs, Muslims and Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is their common and indivisible homeland; #Freedom of religion and conscience and the equality of all religions; #Freedom of assembly and agreement, association and the press; #Personal and property security of citizens, as well as the freedom of private initiative in economic life; #Equality between women and men, both in the political life of the country and in all spheres of social activity; #Election law in a democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, voters will be made by secret ballot on the basis of universal, equal and direct suffrage; #Active and passive suffrage has every male and female citizen who are over 18 years of age, and are not deprived of this right under the law; #The fighters of the National Liberation Army and Yugoslav partisan have this right irrespective of age; #Every citizen is guaranteed the right to appeal the decision of the authorities, as well as the right to petition and complaints to all bodies of state power; #No one may be sentenced without court proceedings.

It is native to the islands of Mauritius and R√©union. It is known from fewer than five locations in its range, but it is common at a few sites. It roosts in caves, and it is considered to be an endangered species due to disturbance of its cave habitat. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1804 by French naturalist Johann Hermann. Hermann placed it in the genus Vespertilio. In 2008, the Natal free-tailed bat was split into two taxa with the description of a new species, Mormopterus francoismoutoui. The species is called the \\"Natal\\" free-tailed bat because of another species Hermann described, Dysopes natalensis, named after the Natal Province of South Africa. Dysopes natalensis was later synonymized with the Natal free-tailed bat. Its species name \\"acetabulosus\\" is Latin for saucer-shaped. Description The Natal free- tailed bat is a very small species of bat. Its upper lip is very wrinkled. Its ears are small and connected in the back by a thin interaural membrane. Males have a sebaceous gland, as with some other free-tailed bats, but they do not have an interaural crest. Its dental formula is for a total of 30 teeth. Range and habitat It is endemic to Mauritius. There is one \\"doubtful\\" record from Madagascar and two records from South Africa which may be vagrants. Conservation As of 2017, it is listed as endangered by the IUCN. From 1999-2017, its population likely declined by more than 80%. Its caves are being disturbed for tourism.

It is native to Peru and northern Chile. Relatively little is known about the species, but it is thought to be common in its range. It is sometimes seen in urban areas. Molecular sequencing data indicates that the closest relatives of M. kalinowski are members of another genus, Nyctinomops. Taxonomy and etymology It was described as a new species in 1893 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas. Thomas initially placed it in the now-defunct genus Nyctinomus, with the scientific name Nyctinomus kalinowskii. The eponym for the species name \\"kalinowskii\\" was Jan Kalinowski, a Polish zoologist who immigrated to Peru. Thomas wanted to acknowledge Kalinowski's efforts in collecting the holotype, saying that he was the collector \\"to whose labours we owe the valuable collection of small Mammals described in the present paper.\\" By 1907, at least one author had reclassified N. kalinowskii into the genus Mormopterus, where it has consistently remained as Mormopterus kalinowskii. Description It is a very small species of bat, with a forearm length of , a head and body length of , and a tail length of . Its fur is pale gray in color. Its ears are smaller than many other species of free-tailed bat, and they are not conjoined. Its dental formula is , for a total of 28 teeth. Range and habitat It has been documented in two countries in South America: Peru and Chile. Conservation It is currently evaluated as least-concern by the IUCN--its lowest conservation priority. It meets the criteria for this assessment because its population is presumably large, and its habitat is not declining in extent or quality fast enough to qualify for more-threatened categories. Some of its range includes protected areas. It can tolerate some disturbance, and small populations have been found within cities.

Distribution M. minutus is the only species of bat endemic to Cuba. Specimens have been collected from Trinidad, Cuba (type locality), as well as the Cuban municipalities of Omaja and Guaro (near Preston). In 1911, Glover Morrill Allen hypothesized that the ancestor of the little goblin bat originated in Central America, and dispersed to Cuba by way of the Yucatan land bridge, which no longer exists. This hypothesis of Cuban Mormopterus originating in Central America was echoed by Karl Koopman in 1989, as per Mancina 2007. Taxonomic history The species was described by Gerrit Smith Miller, Jr. in 1899 and initially placed in the genus Nyctinomus. This species's holotype is a male specimen collected by Frank M. Chapman of the American Museum of Natural History. Miller notes Chapman had identified this specimen as Nyctinomus brasiliensis in an earlier paper. The specific epithet minutus is Latin for \\"small, paltry\\"; Miller wrote in his species description that it was the \\"smallest known species of Nyctinomus\\". In 1907, Miller classified this species in the genus Mormopterus. The Mormopterus genus is further divided into species group, which classify members of the genus based on how closely related they are. The little goblin bat is placed in the kalinowskii group, which also contains the following species: *Kalinowski's mastiff bat (Mormopterus kalinowskii) *Incan little mastiff bat (Mormopterus phrudus) Biology It is insectivorous, locating insects while in flight using echolocation. This species has the ability to change its echolocation style based on the environment that it is in. The parasite Ochoterenatrema breckenridgei, a trematode in the order Plagiorchiida, has been found in its digestive tract. O. breckenridgeii uses mosquitoes as intermediate hosts; when bats eat the mosquitoes, the parasites are able to mature into adults within their intestines. Conservation , it is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this assessment because its area of occupancy is less than , and there is a projected decline in the extent and quality of its habitat. Its population is decreasing. A main threat to this species is habitat destruction. Some disagree with the IUCN's assessment of the species, asserting that it should instead be listed as near threatened.

Biography =Birth and Education= Born in Abeokuta, Nigeria, as Oladipo Felix Solanke, he studied at the Fourah Bay College in Sierra Leone before moving to study law at University College, London, in 1922.Solanke, Oladipo Felix, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. In Britain, Solanke joined the Union of Students of African Descent. In 1924, he wrote to West Africa to complain about an article in the Evening News, which had claimed that cannibalism and black magic had been common in Nigeria until recent years.Jinny Kathleen Prais, \\"Imperial Travelers: The Formation of West African Urban Culture, Identity, and Citizenship in London and Accra, 1925--1935\\", Ph.D dissertation, University of Michigan (2008), pp. 57‚Äì59. His protest received the support of Amy Ashwood Garvey, who became a close friend, while Solanke began studying British papers for other derogatory reports.Hakim Adi, West Africans in Britain: 1900-1960. =Teaching= Finding himself living in poverty, Solanke began teaching Yoruba and was annoyed by the lack of interest in traditional Nigerian culture among other Nigerian students in London. In June 1924, he became the first person to broadcast on the radio in Yoruba. The following month, with Garvey's encouragement, Solanke and twelve other students founded the Nigeria Progress Union to promote the welfare of Nigerian students. In 1925, Solanke and Herbert Bankole-Bright founded the West African Students' Union (WASU) as a social, cultural and political focus for West African students in Britain. He became the organisation's Secretary-General and the main contributor to its journal, Wasu. In 1926, he recorded music in Yoruba for Zonophone, and in 1927, he published United West Africa at the Bar of the Family of Nations, calling for Africans to enjoy universal suffrage. Solanke also led WASU's drive for a hostel for West Africans in London. =West Africa= In 1929, he left for a fundraising tour of West Africa. He spent three years travelling, his mission being supported by the West African and followed by most of the local press. While there, branches of WASU were founded in each country he visited. He also met Opeolu Obisanya, and the couple later married. =Return to Britain= Solanke returned to Britain with sufficient funds to open the planned hostel, named \\"Africa House\\", and became its first warden. However, he faced serious criticism from some WASU members over alleged extravagant spending while in Africa. During the 1930s and 40s, Solanke was able to use his friendships with figures including Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, Reginald Sorensen and Nathaniel Fadipe to further the causes of West African unity and anti-racism, raising the profile of WASU. When cocoa farmers in the Gold Coast tried to break a cartel of British companies, they wrote to Solanke personally to gain his assistance, and he was able to organise a large campaign in Britain, including questions in Parliament. In 1944, Solanke returned to West Africa to raise funds for a new hostel, and did not return to Britain until 1948. The trip again proved a success, but in his absence, WASU had increasingly come under the influence of Kwame Nkrumah and then Joe Appiah. Faced with internal dissent, Solanke stepped down as Secretary-General in 1949, to campaign against communist influence in the union. His efforts to organise a slate of anti-communist candidates to contest the elections to the WASU executive in 1951 proved unsuccessful, and in January 1953 he finally split with the union after it decided to close Africa House, due to financial pressures. Solanke maintained the hostel with his own dwindling funds, until his death from lung cancer in London in September 1958.

Wells Drive. Aerial view of Chicago with The Old Chicago Main Post Office visible in the bottom right A postcard commemorating the New Chicago Post Office dedication, February 15, 1933 The Old Chicago Main Post Office is a nine-story-tall building in downtown Chicago. The original building was designed by Graham, Anderson, Probst & White and built in 1921, but the structure was expanded greatly in 1932 in order to serve Chicago's great volume of postal business, swollen by the mail-order businesses of Montgomery Ward (the largest retailer in the United States) and of Sears (its competitor). After sitting vacant for nearly two decades, the building was bought in 2014 by English real estate developer Bill Davies for $24 million at auction. Davies proposed an ambitious redevelopment plan that was never realized; on May 13, 2016, the building was sold by Davies, who died the next day. After extensive renovations undergone by real-estate company 601W, the building opened to office tenants in October 2019. In August 2019, Uber signed a 10-year lease to become the building's largest tenant, occupying . Construction on the space to be utilized by Uber will begin in the spring of 2020. The structure will also include new Chicago offices for Walgreens, occupying and housing 1,800 employees.. PepsiCo will relocate its Chicago office of 1,300 employees and occupy , while the Ferrara Candy Company announced that it would relocate its headquarters to the Post Office building in 2019, occupying and bringing nearly 400 jobs. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago will also be a tenant.  History  The original 1922 structure was a brick-sided mail terminal building, sited just east of the main building that spans the Eisenhower Expressway as it turns into Ida B. Wells Drive. Major expansion in 1932 added a total of nine floors for more than , or 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m¬≤), of floorspace. Its footprint, as initially designed, would have blocked the proposed Congress Parkway extension; as a compromise, a hole for the Parkway was reserved in the base of the Post Office and utilized twenty years later. Competitors Montgomery Ward and Sears combined to make Chicago \\"the nation's mail-order capital\\". (Montgomery Ward, which became the largest retailer in the United States in the late 1930s, was eventually passed by Sears, and then was purchased and merged.) In 1966 the Main Chicago Post Office came to a halt when a logjam of 10 million pieces of mail clogged the system for nearly a week. With Chicago rated worst in postal deliveries, a new Main Post Office to be located right across Harrison Street was proposed. In 1997, the old building was vacated in favor of the new, modernized facility. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. A February 2006 report by the General Accounting Office stated that it cost the government $2 million a year to maintain the retired building. On June 9, 2009, the Chicago Sun-Times reported that the postal service was placing the post office on the auction block. Held on August 27 and conducted by Rick Levin & Associates Inc., the auction raised $40 million, which was well over the opening bid of $300,000. The buyer was reported to be English real estate developer Bill Davies.David Roeder. \\"High bidder defaults on deal to buy old Chicago Post Office\\". Chicago Sun-Times. October 14, 2009.

Chicago Sun-Times. October 22, 2009. Retrieved on October 22, 2009. = Redevelopment plan during 2011-14 = The Old Chicago Main Post Office Redevelopment was an approved project on a lot located along the Chicago River on the southwest side of Downtown Chicago, Illinois to be constructed in phases over a period of one decade that would have included the renovation of the building as well as residential, retail, entertainment and office space. The plan included several towers, the tallest one being a proposed 120-story mixed use twin tower skyscraper to stand about high to the roof, which would have made it the tallest building in the United States, over taller than the Willis Tower, containing office, residential, and hotel space. It would also have included two 60-story residential towers as well as a 40-story hotel. All the buildings in the development were to be connected via a ground-level complex that would have been built over the Chicago River and the Eisenhower Expressway. More specifically, it was exactly one year and nine months after acquiring the post office property from the Postal Service when Davies unveiled his plan for the Post Office on July 21, 2011. The proposal, which involved three other properties besides the 14-story Post Office, was broken down into three phases pending the required $3.5 billion in funding: * Phase 1: Converting the Post Office into a retail complex whose main entrance would be through the Beaux Arts-inspired lobby along Van Buren street, the remaining interior would become a parking garage, and a 40-story hotel on the east side of the building. (Approximate cost: $450 million) * Phase 2: Building a 60-story hotel west of the Post Office and a 120-story, office, hotel, and residential tower that would be the tallest in North America. (Approximate cost: $2 billion) * Phase 3: Two residential towers built on the east side of the Chicago River diagonally southeast from the proposed 120-story skyscraper plus a 12,000 space parking garage. (Approximate cost: $1 billion) The whole $3.5 billion plan was submitted to the Chicago City Council and the Planning Commission for approval the same day it was released to the public. Only funding for Phase 1 had been secured as of July 21, 2011. The proposal was sent to the Chicago City Commission in July 2011 for approval, which was expected to be a several-month process. The project had an estimated cost of $3.5 billion and the potential to create 12,000 jobs. Some critics opposed the proposal, calling it old-fashioned and suburban and an unrealistic pipe dream, as it was largely car oriented (12,000 parking spaces and free parking) with shopping mall style retail. The city voted and approved the plan July 18, 2013. In spring of 2013, Antunovich Associates, who purchased the site three years ago, created a new proposal on the site featuring a 1000-foot skyscraper (with a 2,000 foot tower in their 2nd phase). Other potential uses include a casino and/or entertainment complex. On June 18, 2014, Bill Davies announced the formation of a $500 million joint venture with Sterling Bay Companies for phase I of the redevelopment. On July 18, Sterling announced a new relationship with J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which gave them access to new financial resources. However, Davies never found sufficient financing. In December 2014, Davies canceled the project and put the post office building up for sale.  2016 sale and plans  In February 2016, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel pressed for development of the site, threatening to take possession of the building by use of eminent domain. In March, the city's Department of Planning and Development issued an RFP seeking bids due June 10 for redevelopment of the site. Later that week, with announcement of a conditional sale of the building, it turned out that Davies had been in negotiation since May 2015 for sale of the building to 601W, a New York City-based real estate company which owns Chicago's Aon Center and One Prudential Plaza buildings. On May 13, 2016, completion of the sale from Davies to 601W was announced by Emanuel. Davies died the next day. Vicky Flores, who ran the Chicago office of Davies' firm, commented: \\"'It was really weird, the timing. Everything was signed off, and then I heard he had died. It was like he waited until everything was taken care of.'\\" In a $500 million renovation, Gensler plans on renovation of the space into office space, with addition of a rooftop park and a riverwalk. In September 2017 the post office was one of 6 sites in Chicago considered for the new Amazon \\"HQ2\\" location. In September 2019, Uber Freight announced it would be based at the site, adding 2,000 jobs.  In popular culture  The building was used in the filming of Batman Begins in 2004, and The Dark Knight in April 2007. The building is seen from above in the opening credits of Candyman. In the summer of 2010, Paramount Pictures and Michael Bay filmed numerous scenes for Transformers: Dark of the Moon in and around Chicago. The old Chicago Post Office's east facade was decorated as the \\"Department of Health and Human Services\\" where the Autobots were kept by the federal government in the movies. The same interior that was used for filming of the bank heist in The Dark Knight was used again for Transformers: Dark of the Moon. There were also some scattered shots from the Post Office interior used throughout the film.

Built in 1909 as an addition to the Lamar House Hotel, the theater has at various times served as performance venue for traditional theatre, vaudeville, a second-run moviehouse, a commencement stage for the city's African-American high school, and a pornographic movie theater. The Lamar House Hotel, in which the theater was constructed, was originally built in 1817, and modified in the 1850s. The building and theater were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.Dean Novelli, \\"On a Corner of Gay Street: A History of the Lamar House--Bijou Theater, Knoxville, Tennessee, 1817 - 1985.\\" East Tennessee Historical Society Publications, Vol. 56 (1984), pp. 3-45. The Lamar House Hotel was built by Irish immigrant Thomas Humes (1767-1816) and his descendants, and quickly developed into a gathering place for Knoxville's wealthy. In 1819, Andrew Jackson became the first of five presidents to lodge at the hotel, and in the early 1850s, local businessmen purchased and expanded the building into a lavish 75-room complex. During the Civil War, the Union Army used the hotel as a hospital for its war wounded, among them General William P. Sanders, who died at the hotel in 1863. Following the war, the hotel became the center of Knoxville's Gilded Age extravagance, hosting lavish masquerade balls for the city's elite.Knoxville: Fifty Landmarks. (Knoxville: The Knoxville Heritage Committee of the Junior League of Knoxville, 1976), p. 15. In 1909, the rear wing of the building was replaced by the Bijou Theatre structure, entered through a new lobby cut through the hotel building from Gay Street. The theater opened on March 8, 1909, and over the next four decades would host performers such as the Marx Brothers, Dizzy Gillespie, John Philip Sousa, the Ballets Russes, Ethel Barrymore, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, John Cullum, and Houdini. After a period of decline in the 1960s and early 1970s, local preservationists purchased the building and renovated the theater. Design The Bijou orchestra floor, boxes, and stage, viewed from the upper right loggia The Bijou Theatre building consists of two parts-- the original hotel section, completed in 1817, and the rear theater section, built in 1909. The main entrance opens into a foyer, from which the rear theater section and the building's front corner wings are accessed (the south corner wing is occupied by a restaurant, The Bistro). From the foyer, the rear entrance opens into a bar, with passageways to the left and right leading to the theater's orchestra floor, and stairways to the left and right accessing the theater's balconies and the original building's second floor (now offices for the theater). The building's facade was probably designed in the Georgian style, but its original appearance was extensively altered in the 1850s. Many of these alterations resulted from the macadamizing of Gay Street in 1854. The grading of the street during this period exposed the hotel's cellar, which was subsequently converted into the main entrance. The theater has a capacity of approximately 700, with two balcony levels. There are two loggia levels and three box levels on each side of the building. The stage is deep and wide. The theater is decorated with notable Classical Revival elements, which include Corinthian columns supporting the box levels, reclining muse pediments above the top box levels, and grape-and-vine motifs adorning the front of the boxes and balconies. History =Early history= The Bijou stands on Lot 38 of the original survey of Knoxville drawn by Charles McClung in 1791. Thomas Humes, who operated a nearby store on Gay Street, purchased parts of the lot in 1801 and 1805. In 1816, Humes began building the three-story structure on the lot that he planned to operate as a tavern and hotel, but died before the building was completed. Humes's widow, Margaret Russell Cowan, continued construction, however, and the \\"Knoxville Hotel\\" opened sometime around July 1817. The hotel was initially managed by a local tavern owner named Archibald Rhea, and was advertised as the largest in East Tennessee. The three-story hotel featured 13 rooms, a saloon, dining room, and had its own granary and stables. Throughout much of the 1820s and 1830s, the hotel was managed by a local hotelier named Joseph Jackson, and developed into a popular gathering place for the city's elite. Humes's children sold the hotel in 1837 to John Pickett and William Belden, who rechristened it the \\"City Hotel.\\" During this period, each room in the hotel contained two feather beds, a table and chairs, and a washstand and looking glass. The hotel also had its own library, a lounge with a piano, and a dining room that served meals on silver plates and china. =Lamar House and the Civil War= The Lamar House on an 1886 map of Knoxville, showing the original section (facing Gay Street, on the right), and the two early-1850s ell wings In 1852, Knoxville banker William M. Churchwell purchased the hotel, and closed it in order to carry out renovations. Churchwell added a by ell overlooking Cumberland Street, expanding the hotel's capacity to 75, and then added a second ell to the first to serve as the hotel's kitchen, laundry and dining hall/ballroom. The hotel reopened under the name \\"Coleman House\\" in 1854, but in 1856 it was renamed \\"Lamar House\\" after investor Gazaway Bugg Lamar. That same year, Churchwell was forced to sell the hotel to William H. Sneed to cover bank debts. In the months leading up to the Civil War, the Lamar House was favored by the city's secessionist leaders (Sneed himself was a staunch secessionist). District Attorney J. C. Ramsey, who ruthlessly prosecuted the city's Unionists during the war, listed the hotel as his business address. In October 1860, ex-Congressman John H. Crozier delivered a pro-secession speech in front of the hotel in which he called the city's pro-Union newspaperman, Parson Brownlow, a \\"coward.\\"Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 45. During the Confederate Army's occupation of Knoxville (1861-1863), Confederate officers boarded at the Lamar House. When the Union Army took control of Knoxville in September 1863, the Lamar House was converted into a hospital. General William P. Sanders died in the hotel's bridal suite from wounds suffered during the Knoxville Campaign on November 19, 1863. His death was kept secret throughout the two-week Siege of Knoxville for fear it would demoralize Union soldiers. After the war, Parson Brownlow filed a lawsuit against Sneed and other ex- Confederates, demanding their property be confiscated. By 1866, however, Sneed had regained control of the hotel. =Gilded Age and decline= Lamar House advertisement, 1884 After Sneed died in 1869, his children inherited the Lamar House, and over the next two decades, the hotel once again developed into the preferred gathering place for Knoxville's elite. The hotel's status was enhanced by the construction of Staub's Theatre-- Knoxville's first opera house-- across the street in 1872. Masquerade balls were held regularly in the hotel's ballroom, with cigars, imported wines, and oysters served. Frequent attendees included author Frances Hodgson Burnett (whose brother worked as a bartender at the hotel) and artist Lloyd Branson. President Rutherford B. Hayes stayed at the hotel during his visit to Knoxville in September 1877.Jack Neely, Knoxville's Secret History (Scruffy Books, 1995), pp. 13, 70-71. General James Holt Clanton died at the Lamar House on September 27, 1871, after being wounded in a shootout with attorney David Nelson.Thomas Alexander, Thomas A. R. Nelson of East Tennessee (Nashville: Tennessee Historical Commission, 1956), p. 152.Knoxville Press and Herald, 28 September 1871. In the 1890s, Knoxville's business focus shifted to the Southern Railroad area toward the north end of Gay Street, and the Lamar Hotel began to decline. Sneed's heirs sold the hotel in 1895, and over the next decade, the hotel shifted through six different owners and various new names before being purchased by the Auditorium Company for the construction of the Bijou in 1908. The hotel was known as \\"Hotel Le Conte\\" from 1930 until the 1950s, and was called \\"Hotel Lamarr\\" in the 1960s. By 1969, the hotel had become notorious for prostitution, and the city ordered it closed. =Bijou Theatre= The Auditorium Company, headed by businessman C. B. Atkin and theater manager Jake Wells, purchased the hotel in 1908 with the intention of adding a theater. The hotel's ell wings were torn down, and the brick theater wing was built in their place, with entrances added to the hotel's lobby. The theater, built at a cost of $50,000, originally had a capacity of 1,500, and featured electric lighting. The theater's backstage was equipped with a two-story scene dock and an Otis elevator to move sets. Orchestra floor, looking toward the stage On March 8, 1909, the theater's opening night production of George Cohan's Little Johnny Jones was viewed by a sold-out audience. Traditional theater played a major role in the Bijou's early success, with performances that included Mr. Green's Reception, which starred the Marx Brothers. Between 1914 and 1921, B. F. Keith's company managed the Bijou, and vaudeville became the theater's primary attraction. While African-Americans were only allowed in the theater's gallery (now the upper balcony) on main performance nights, Knoxville Colored High School used the theater for commencement ceremonies in the 1910s, and Knoxville College performed plays at the theater. Performers at the Bijou during the 1920s included John Philip Sousa and his band, Anna Pavlova and the Ballet Russe, and magician Harry Blackstone. In 1935, Kincy Theaters purchased the Bijou for use as a second-run moviehouse (the Tennessee Theatre, which opened in 1928, was Knoxville's first-run moviehouse). Live performances continued, however, among them Dorothy Gish in Life with Father in 1941, Lunt and Fontanne in Robert Sherwood's There Shall Be No Night in 1941, and Ethel Barrymore in Emlyn Williams's The Corn Is Green in 1943. The Knoxville Symphony Orchestra used the Bijou for its performances between 1936 and 1941. =Restoration= Gallery on the second floor of the original hotel section By the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knoxville's downtown area had deteriorated, and various companies were using the Bijou to show pornographic movies. In 1974, after its owner was evicted for unpaid property taxes, the building was threatened with demolition, and a group of concerned citizens (the forerunner of Knox Heritage) organized a successful campaign to save the building. The theater was renovated as a center for the performing arts. Another partial renovation followed 20 years later, but funding remained a problem, and maintenance suffered. By 2005, the theater was in danger of defaulting on its mortgage, and was saved once again by two Knoxville businessmen, who held off foreclosure while the loan was renegotiated. After a fundraising campaign spearheaded by Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam and the award of a federal grant, another renovation followed, repairing water damage, renovating the theater seats, and upgrading the stage with modern lighting, sound, and fly equipment.

Publication history 1967 Japanese edition novel cover The novel was first serialized in the Japanese youth magazines Chu-3 Course and K≈ç-1 Course, from November 1965 to May 1966, and has been regularly re-edited in Japan ever since, notably in 1967 (), in 1997 for the release of the second film (), and in a new version in 2006 for the release of the animated film, including two more stories: Akumu no shins√¥ and Hateshinaki tagen uch√ª (). The novel is also published in foreign countries, like France (La Travers√©e du temps, 1983), South Korea, and China. According to the scholar Ulrich Heinze, the novel represents the first fully formed version of time travel as an exploration of self. In contrast to other time travel stories up until the 1960s which typically involved expeditions, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time limited the time jumps to a short period to examine adolescence. It was also an early example of a time loop narrative, anticipating plot elements of the later Hollywood film Groundhog Day (1993).

It was the first free-standing cancer center west of the Mississippi River and the second such institution of its kind in the United States. The center is now connected to University of Missouri Hospital at 1 Hospital Drive. The former Ellis Fischel Cancer Center was located on Business Loop 70 West. History The beginnings of Ellis Fischel can be traced back to 1931 when the Missouri State Medical Association created a committee on cancer. Due to the lack of facilities, the first cancer hospital was a roving hospital that cared for cancer patients of all ages in hospitals across the state. A plan was conceived for a centrally-located hospital in 1937. Dr. Ellis Fischel (1883-1938)https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/7174968/ellis-fischel, a leading St. Louis Oncologist, envisioned a statewide plan for the control of cancer, which included a State Cancer Hospital, equipped with the latest facilities for treatment, staffed by specially trained physicians, with provision for scientific investigation into the causes of the disease, and satellite diagnostic tumor clinics established around the state. Missouri Governor Lloyd C. Stark, a major supporter of this plan, signed a bill to erect the hospital in 1937. Columbia was chosen as the site of the hospital because of the central location and the presence of the University of Missouri, a major cancer research center. The seven-story, 104-bed hospital was built on U.S. Route 40 (now Interstate 70) in 1938. Ellis Fischel was expanded in 1975 to increase laboratory space, clinic capability and operating room suites. The hospital not long after it opened Ellis Fischel Cancer Center joined University of Missouri Health Care in 1990. All inpatient services were moved to University Hospital; outpatient services, such as radiation clinics and screening services, were still located at the facility off of Business Loop 70. After funding was cut from the Missouri State budget, University of Missouri curators decided in May 2010 to float a bond issue for $31 million to pay for the new Ellis Fischel construction. The new Ellis Fischel Cancer Center is now connected to University of Missouri Hospital and takes up three floors of the Patient Care Tower Addition. The first floor and second floor are designated for clinics, and the eighth floor is the inpatient oncology unit. =The Wyatt Guest House= The Ernest and Eugenia Wyatt Guest House is located next to the old Ellis Fischel Cancer Center on Business Loop 70. The Guest House is available for EFCC patients experiencing long-term outpatient care, such as chemotherapy, and families of EFCC inpatients. The house has twelve rooms available for guest use, with each room equipped with two double beds, private bath, telephone, TV, linens and other \\"hotel like\\" amenities. Common areas include the kitchen, TV rooms, library, living room, internet and laundry facilities. The Wyatt Guest house was later closed in June of 2020. =Mizzou North= After Ellis Fischel Cancer Center moved in with University of Missouri Hospital, the building that it once occupied stood vacant for about two years. After further planning, the University of Missouri bought the building from University of Missouri Health Care and started Mizzou North. Mizzou North now houses offices, as well as the University of Missouri's Law Enforcement Training Institute.

Vavra was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1982 amateur player draft out of college. He played five years in the Dodger farm system making it to the AAA level in 1986. He never played in the major leagues due to two injuries. The first happened in his last triple A game when a runner's cleat shattered his thumb when Vavra attempted to tag the runner. The second and final setback was when Vavra fell ill with desert fever (Coccidioidomycosis), a disease that eats at the lungs. Vavra finished the year and had to stop playing. Coaching career Beginning in 1987, Vavra coached in the Dodgers' minor league system. While at Yakima, Washington in Class A, he was named Manager of the Year for 1994 and 1996 for the Northwest League after winning the division title in 1994 and the League championship in 1996. Vavra coached for ten years in the minors before moving to the Dodgers' major league staff. He served in special assignments and as a roving coach before becoming the permanent bunting and baserunning coach in 2000. After a brief stint as the head coach of UW‚ÄìStout baseball, Vavra joined the Twins' staff in 2002. On October 27, 2005, Vavra was named the Twins' hitting coach. Vavra attended the 2008 MLB Home Run Derby at Yankee Stadium to pitch for Justin Morneau. Morneau beat Josh Hamilton to win the Home Run Derby. During Vavra's tenure in Minnesota, the Twins consistently ranked among the best in the league for both individual and team hitting stats. In 2012, it was announced that Vavra would be reassigned from the Twins hitting coach to the Twins third base coach and infield instruction coach in 2013. He was the Twins bench coach from 2015 through 2017. On November 2, 2017, Vavra was named the quality control coach for the Detroit Tigers for the 2018 season. Vavra was promoted to hitting coach prior to the 2020 season. Personal life Vavra and his wife Lesa have three sons: Tanner, Treysen and Terrin. His son Tanner has played at Valparaiso University and Treysen plays for the Eastern Illinois University baseball team. Tanner was drafted in 30th round of 2013 Major League Baseball Draft by the Twins. In 2016, Tanner was an infielder for the independent minor-league St. Paul Saints. Terrin was an All-American with the Minnesota Golden Gophers http://www.startribune.com/joe-vavra-monitors-from-detroit-as-son-terrin- becomes-gophers-all-america/484297341/ before getting drafted in the third round of the 2018 Major League Baseball Draft by the Colorado Rockies, who traded him to the Baltimore Orioles in August 2020. http://www.milb.com/player/index.jsp?sid=milb&player;_id=679631#/career/R/hitting/2020/ALL References External links *Tigers coaching bio Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Albuquerque Dukes players Category:Baseball coaches from Wisconsin Category:Baseball infielders Category:Baseball players from Wisconsin Category:Detroit Tigers coaches Category:Lodi Dodgers players Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches Category:Major League Baseball hitting coaches Category:Major League Baseball third base coaches Category:Minnesota Twins coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:People from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin Category:San Antonio Dodgers players Category:University of Wisconsin‚ÄìStout alumni Category:Wisconsin‚ÄìStout Blue Devils baseball players ","title":"Joe Vavra"},{"id":"10787848","text":"F√©licien Courbet in 1921 F√©licien Courbet (25 February 1888 ‚Äì 1967) was a Belgian water polo player and breaststroke swimmer who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics, in the 1912 Summer Olympics, and in the 1920 Summer Olympics.

Since these devices are not regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act in the United States, the EPA does not require the same kind of efficacy testing that it does for chemical pesticides. Types of devices =Ultrasonic= Ultrasonic devices operate through emitting short wavelength, high frequency sound waves that are too high in pitch to be heard by the human ear (generally accepted to be frequencies greater than 20,000 Hz). Humans are usually unable to hear sounds higher than 20 kHz due to physiological limitations of the cochlea, though there is considerable variation between individuals, especially at such high frequencies. Some animals, such as bats, dogs, and rodents, can hear well into the ultrasonic range. Some insects, such as grasshoppers and locusts, can detect frequencies from 50,000 Hz to 100,000 Hz, and lacewings and moths can detect ultrasound as high as 240,000 Hz produced by insect-hunting bats. Contrary to popular belief, birds cannot hear ultrasonic sound. Some smartphone applications attempt to use this technology to produce high frequency sounds to repel mosquitoes and other insects, but the claims of effectiveness of these applications and of ultrasonic control of pest creatures in general has been questioned. The ultrasonic repeller has several inconvenient side effects in addition to its questionable effectiveness. = Radio wave pest control = The concept of radio wave (RW) or radio frequency (RF) to control the behavior of living organisms has shown promise. According to Drs. Juming Tang and Shaojin Wang at Washington State University (WSU) with colleagues at the University of California-Davis and USDA's Agricultural Research Service in Parlier, California, since RF energy generates heat through agitation of bound water molecules, it generates heat through ionic conduction and agitation of free water molecules in insects. As a result, more thermal energy is converted in insects. RF treatments control insect pests without negatively affecting food stuffs and storage locations. RF treatments may serve as a non-chemical alternative to chemical fumigants for post-harvest pest control in commodities (such as almonds, pecans, pistachios, lentils, peas, and soybeans), reducing the long-term impact on the environment, human health, and competitiveness of agricultural industries. Ultrasound studies In 2003, the Federal Trade Commission required Global Instruments, the maker of the Pest-A-Cator/Riddex series of electromagnetic pest control devices, to discontinue any claims for their efficacy until they are backed by credible scientific evidence. This ban continues to be in effect. In 2007 a Cochrane report reviewed by the Infectious Diseases Group determined that there was no evidence based on 10 field studies, in which ultrasonic repellent devices had been put to the test to suggest that EMRs had any repellent effect on mosquitoes, and therefore no evidence to support their promotion. They advised discontinuing further randomized controlled trials due to field studies showing no promise in the effort to combat malaria. =Effects on animals= Effects on mosquitoes * Bart Knols, an entomologist who chairs the advisory board of the Dutch Malaria Foundation and edits the website Malaria World, states there is \\"no scientific evidence whatsoever\\" that ultrasound repels mosquitoes. * In 2005, the British consumer magazine Holiday reported the results of its test of a range of mosquito deterrents. The magazine's editor Lorna Cowan described the four appliances that used a buzzer as \\"a shocking waste of money\\" which \\"should be removed from sale\\". One, the Lovebug, a ladybird-shaped gadget designed to be clipped onto a baby's cot or child's pushchair - was singled out as a particular cause for concern, because of the likelihood that parents would trust it to keep mosquitoes away, and their children would be hurt as a result. (The Lovebug is still readily available in Europe, though it was withdrawn from the US market after the Federal Trade Commission reprimanded the manufacturer Prince Lionheart.) Effects on rodents Based on a review of tests of six commercial products, a report made at the University of Lincoln, Nebraska in 1995 concluded that all the devices, when evaluated at a range of frequencies and decibel levels, were insufficient in repelling rodents. The EPA pursued legal action against purveyors of the products, and none were subsequently marketed as a result of fines against the manufacturers. Safety Professor Tim Leighton at the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, University of Southampton, U.K. produced an 83-page paper entitled \\"What is Ultrasound?\\" (2007), in which he expressed concern about the growth in commercial products which exploit the discomforting effects of in-air ultrasound (to pests for whom it is within their audible frequency range, or to humans for whom it is not, but who can experience unpleasant subjective effects and, potentially, shifts in the hearing threshold). Leighton claims that commercial products are often advertised with cited levels which cannot be critically accepted due to lack of accepted measurement standards for ultrasound in air, and little understanding of the mechanism by which they may represent a hazard. However, there has not yet been sufficient research to confirm or deny a link between invisible ultrasound and hearing problems in humans.https://www.bshaa.com/News/invisible-ultrasound-can-be-a-cause-of- tinnitus The UK's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) produced a 180-page report on the health effects of human exposure to ultrasound and infrasound in 2010. The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) published their report, which recommended an exposure limit for the general public to airborne ultrasound sound pressure levels (SPL) of 70 dB (at 20 kHz), and 100 dB (at 25 kHz and above).

Established in 1959, it was located at 99 East 52nd Street, in the Seagram Building in Midtown Manhattan until 2016. From 2018 to its closure in 2019, it was located it 42 East 49th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The restaurant was owned by the Bronfman family, Alex von Bidder, and Julian Niccolini at the time of its closure. The Four Seasons is associated with a number of milestone firsts in the hospitality industry. The Four Seasons is credited with introducing the idea of seasonally-changing menus to America, and was the first destination restaurant to print its menus in English. The restaurant was widely praised, winning the James Beard Award many times. The restaurant's interior, which was designed by the building's architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, remained almost unchanged since construction in 1959. Art inside the restaurant included paintings by Mark Rothko; a permanent mural by James Rosenquist; a major Richard Lippold sculpture; a curtain designed by Pablo Picasso; and temporary exhibitions that includedworks by Joan Mir√≥, Frank Stella, Ronnie Landfield, Robert Indiana, and Richard Anuszkiewicz. The restaurant's interior was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an interior landmark in 1989. History = 20th century = Joseph Baum of Restaurant Associates created the Four Seasons on the ground floor of the Seagram Building in 1959. The restaurant's managers enjoyed carte blanche to create what was then, at the cost of $4.5 million (about $40 million in 2019), the most expensive restaurant ever built in New York City. By 1973 the restaurant was considered to be past its prime. Restaurant Associates was overextended and unloaded the lease. Tom Margittai and Paul Kovi acquired The Four Seasons. In 1977, the book publisher Michael Korda proclaimed the Grill Room ‚Äúthe most powerful place to eat lunch in town‚Äù. A 1979 article in Esquire declared its Grill Room the setting for ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs Most Powerful Lunch‚Äù. It is believed the term \\"power lunch\\" comes from this article. In 1994 Margittai and Kovi passed the torch to their junior partners, Alex von Bidder and Julian Niccolini, who continued to run the restaurant in the Seagram Building until 2016. = Demise = In June 2015, Aby Rosen, owner of the Seagram Building, announced that the restaurant's lease would not be extended. The Four Seasons‚Äô rent went from $20 per square foot to $105. The Seagram Building location closed after dinner service on July 16, 2016. In July 2016, the furnishings of the restaurant (\\"virtually all its contents\\") were sold at auction in New York. The sale carried a high estimate of $1.33 million but at the end of the day it had brought in $4.1 million. Four ashtrays were sold for $12,500. In August 2018, The Four Seasons opened at a new, smaller midtown location at 42 East 49th Street. The new space was designed by Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld and it cost $30 million to build. Many of the design elements evoked the iconic d√©cor at the former location. The Four Seasons was closed permanently on June 11, 2019. Two new restaurants are now located in the Seagram Building. In what was the Four Seasons' Pool Room is a restaurant called the Pool which is closed and reformed to the Grill. The former Grill Room is the home of another restaurant, called The Grill.  Food  The Four Seasons is associated with a number of milestone firsts in the hospitality industry. The Four Seasons is credited with introducing the idea of seasonally-changing menus to America. James Beard is considered founding father of The Four Seasons restaurant and a principal contributor to the development of its seasonal-food concept. He paired appropriate wines for each season, including offering American wines for the first time. It was the first destination restaurant to print its menus in English. The Four Seasons was also the first restaurant in the United States to cook using fresh, wild mushrooms. The restaurant pioneered what later came to be called ‚ÄúNew American Cuisine.‚Äù Cotton candy was a house specialty.  Clientele  Most reviewers came to think the menu was never really the point of the restaurant which became a stage for the high and the mighty. The restaurant is known as much for its clientele as its food, with its Midtown location making it convenient for power lunches. Anna Wintour, Henry Kissinger, Martha Stewart, Bill Clinton, George Lois, Bill Bernbach and Jackie Kennedy were regular customers. Philip Johnson had lunch there daily at a special table in the Grill Room.  Design  300x300px The restaurant's interior, which was designed by the building's architects Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson, remained almost unchanged since construction in 1959. The restaurant was designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission as an interior landmark in 1989. The restaurant consisted of two separate 60 by 60 ft rooms with 20 ft high ceilings. The Grill Room featured French walnut paneling and two intricate wire and metal sculptures by Richard Lippold. A passage between the two rooms featured a large stage curtain, \\"Le Tricorne\\" (1919) which Pablo Picasso painted for the Ballets Russes. The Pool Room centered around a white, 20 by 20 ft marble pool with ornamental trees at the pool's corners. Four large planters at the corners of the pool held trees that were changed concurrently with the seasons. In both rooms the windows had metal curtains that rippled from the air released by hidden ventilating ducts. The east wall had a balcony behind a double row of walnut panels. The lower panels could be opened. The ceiling panels held specially designed lighting which could be adjusted to the day or season. Over a hundred items of serviceware were designed by L. Garth Huxtable and Ada Louise Huxtable, everything from champagne glasses to bread trays. The work took over nine months. Today they and all of the Four Seasons Restaurant's furniture are part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art. For the celebration of the restaurant's 50th anniversary, The Four Seasons hired Manhattan Architect Belmont Freeman FAIA for a full restoration of the ladies' lounge.  Art  The artist Mark Rothko was engaged to paint a series of works for the restaurant in 1958. Accepting the commission, he secretly resolved to create \\"something that will ruin the appetite of every son-of-a-bitch who ever eats in that room.\\" Observing the restaurant's pretentious atmosphere upon his return from a trip to Europe, Rothko abandoned the project altogether, returned his advance and kept the paintings for himself. The final series was dispersed and now hangs in three locations: London's Tate Gallery, Japan's Kawamura Memorial Museum and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.How Rothko's Seagram murals found their way to London, the Guardian retrieved online September 10, 2009 During the period in which Rothko worked on his murals, the Four Seasons rented Jackson Pollock's masterpiece Blue Poles from its then-owner, art collector Ben Heller.art on air Retrieved June 29, 2010 From 1975 until 1985 four paintings by Ronnie Landfield from the collection of Philip Johnson were installed on the wall that had been initially planned for the Mark Rothko commission. In 1985 the artist James Rosenquist was commissioned to install a permanent mural on the wall; the Landfield paintings were returned to Philip Johnson. A major Richard Lippold sculpture was installed in the Front Bar, which hung from the ceiling. The large, 20 by 20 ft curtain designed by Pablo Picasso for the Ballets Russes ballet Le Tricorne (1919) was hung between the Grill Room and the Pool Room from when the original location of the restaurant opened until 2014 when the work was given to the New York Historical Society.https://www.nyhistory.org/exhibitions/picassos-le-tricorne-0 The curtain is a portion of a Picasso tapestry used as a prop for the ballet that was purchased in 1957 by Phyllis Lambert, the daughter of the Seagram founder Samuel Bronfman, and installed in the entryway to the restaurant for its opening in 1959. In 2014, the curtain was removed permanently from that location, and is currently in the New-York Historical Society.Segal, David, At Four Seasons, Picasso Tapestry Hangs on the Edge of Eviction, The New York Times, February 4, 2014, page A1 and on the internet, Controversy over the plans to remove the curtain existed and the Museum of Modern Art offered storage space for it if the outcome is removal. In addition to the works on permanent public display there were other works and continuously revolving exhibitions in the dining rooms and the 52nd Street entrance walls, including works by Joan Mir√≥, paintings by Frank Stella, Ronnie Landfield, Robert Indiana, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, among others. Awards and honors The restaurant itself was widely praised, winning the James Beard Award many times ‚Äì for Outstanding Wine Service in 1997 and for Outstanding Service in 1998; It was called an \\"Outstanding Restaurant\\" in 1999 and a \\"Design Icon\\" in 2016.

The district approximately includes parts of the following hamlets; Levittown, North Wantagh, and Seaford. Currently, there are six elementary schools (K-5), two middle schools (6-8), two high schools (9-12) and one career & technical center. The school district sits on over of property, and its facilities occupy over . The district has a transportation complex of 5 buildings, a buildings and grounds complex of 4 buildings, a middle school leased to BOCES, 22 pump houses and storage sheds as well as vacant property on which once sat an elementary school. The district operates its own Transportation System, transporting over 4,000 students per day. Transportation is available for those students in Grades K-8 who live beyond 3/4 of a mile and 9-12 who live beyond from their respective school. The district implemented an all day Kindergarten program in 2011/12. The school district administration is headed by Dr. Tonie McDonald, the current Superintendent of Schools, appointed July 1, 2014. Her contract has been expanded expires on June 30, 2021. Dr. Tonie McDonald is a life long Levittown resident who taught and rose through the ranks of the district she now leads. The Board of Education President is Peggy Marenghi. She was elected to the Board of Education until June 30, 2019. History Levittown School District, which dates back to the 19th century, was originally called the Jerusalem School District of the Town of Hempstead. The school district actually services areas of Levittown, Wantagh, Seaford, Plainedge and a small part of Hicksville. It has approximately 7,400 students in 2014/15 a small uptick from the previous year. The district also has one of the largest special education programs in the country and is widely purported to be one of the best in the Special Education Field. Its 2014/15 budget was approx. 199,000,000 USD, up approximately 1.5 million from 2013/14. The district operates 6 elementary schools, 2 middle schools and 2 high schools. In 1983, a third HS was closed due to falling enrollment. That building, Levittown Memorial now serves as a central office, The Gerald R. Claps Career and Technical Center and the Alternative HS as well. The district recently closed Laurel Lane, which until June 2009 was the site of the alternative Education High School. That building is now partially leased to the ELIJA School for approximately 125,000 per year. The district also owns, and leases the buildings called Seaman's Neck, a former elementary School. The school district owns the historic little red schoolhouse on North Jerusalem road. Built in 1876, it was originally the only school building in Jerusalem District #5 in the 19th century. It has been updated according to historical guidelines and is currently leased as a day care facility. The district also owns property on Pintail Lane, a former elementary school built in 1958. It was closed due to low enrollment in 1976 and the building remained vacant until 1983 when the property was sold to developers. Neighborhood protests led to numerous delays after the building was razed. The property remains vacant today and is under the maintenance of the LUFSD. Administration The school district is run by a superintendent and 3 assistant superintendents, to whom different educational areas are assigned. The following is an updated list of Levittown's current administration: *Dr. Tonie McDonald: Superintendent *Mr. Todd Winch: Assistant Superintendent for Instruction *Ms. Debbie Rifkin: Assistant Superintendent for Human Resources *Dr. Christopher Dillion: Assistant Superintendent for Business and Finance Board of Education *President: Peggy Marenghi (term expires 06/30/2022) *Vice President: Dillon Cain (term expires 6/30/2020) *Trustee: Michael Pappas (term expires 6/30/2020) *Trustee: Marianne Adrian (term expires 6/30/2021) *Trustee: James Moran (term expires 6/30/2021) *Trustee: Christina Lang (term expires 6/30/2022) *Trustee: Jennifer Messina (term expires 6/30/2020) Schools =Elementary schools (K-5)= *Abbey Lane (erected 1949) *East Broadway (erected 1952) *Gardiners Avenue (erected 1949) *Lee Road (erected 1957) *Northside (erected 1951) *Summit Lane (erected 1952) Closed Schools *Seaman Neck Elementary School (1955‚Äî1997); still owned by the district, now leased by Nassau County as a special education facility for students ages 10‚Äì14. *Pintail Lane Primary School (1958‚Äî1976); closed due to declining enrollment.

In mathematics, convex metric spaces are, intuitively, metric spaces with the property any \\"segment\\" joining two points in that space has other points in it besides the endpoints. Formally, consider a metric space (X, d) and let x and y be two points in X. A point z in X is said to be between x and y if all three points are distinct, and : d(x, z)+d(z, y)=d(x, y),\\\\, that is, the triangle inequality becomes an equality. A convex metric space is a metric space (X, d) such that, for any two distinct points x and y in X, there exists a third point z in X lying between x and y. Metric convexity: * does not imply convexity in the usual sense for subsets of Euclidean space (see the example of the rational numbers) * nor does it imply path-connectedness (see the example of the rational numbers) * nor does it imply geodesic convexity for Riemannian manifolds (consider, for example, the Euclidean plane with a closed disc removed). Examples * Euclidean spaces, that is, the usual three-dimensional space and its analogues for other dimensions, are convex metric spaces. Given any two distinct points x and y in such a space, the set of all points z satisfying the above \\"triangle equality\\" forms the line segment between x and y, which always has other points except x and y, in fact, it has a continuum of points. A circle as a convex metric space. * Any convex set in a Euclidean space is a convex metric space with the induced Euclidean norm. For closed sets the converse is also true: if a closed subset of a Euclidean space together with the induced distance is a convex metric space, then it is a convex set (this is a particular case of a more general statement to be discussed below). * A circle is a convex metric space, if the distance between two points is defined as the length of the shortest arc on the circle connecting them. Metric segments Let (X, d) be a metric space (which is not necessarily convex). A subset S of X is called a metric segment between two distinct points x and y in X, if there exists a closed interval [a, b] on the real line and an isometry : \\\\gamma:[a, b] \\\\to X,\\\\, such that \\\\gamma([a, b])=S, \\\\gamma(a)=x and \\\\gamma(b)=y. It is clear that any point in such a metric segment S except for the \\"endpoints\\" x and y is between x and y. As such, if a metric space (X, d) admits metric segments between any two distinct points in the space, then it is a convex metric space. The converse is not true, in general. The rational numbers form a convex metric space with the usual distance, yet there exists no segment connecting two rational numbers which is made up of rational numbers only. If however, (X, d) is a convex metric space, and, in addition, it is complete, one can prove that for any two points x e y in X there exists a metric segment connecting them (which is not necessarily unique). Convex metric spaces and convex sets As mentioned in the examples section, closed subsets of Euclidean spaces are convex metric spaces if and only if they are convex sets. It is then natural to think of convex metric spaces as generalizing the notion of convexity beyond Euclidean spaces, with usual linear segments replaced by metric segments. It is important to note, however, that metric convexity defined this way does not have one of the most important properties of Euclidean convex sets, that being that the intersection of two convex sets is convex. Indeed, as mentioned in the examples section, a circle, with the distance between two points measured along the shortest arc connecting them, is a (complete) convex metric space. Yet, if x and y are two points on a circle diametrically opposite to each other, there exist two metric segments connecting them (the two arcs into which these points split the circle), and those two arcs are metrically convex, but their intersection is the set \\\\\\\\{x, y\\\\\\\\} which is not metrically convex.

It is especially common when spider mites occur in colonies. It requires a high spider mite density and high humidities to become established.  Mode of action Adult gall-midges search for spider mite colonies actively and deposit eggs next to the spider mites. The larvae that hatch feed on spider mite eggs and suck them empty. It takes one week for the eggs to develop to mature larvae. The pupal stage takes approximately one week. Spider mites that are killed by the gall-midge shrivel up and become brown or black. Dozens of larvae can be found per spider mite infested leaf. White cocoons can be visible along the veins of the leaf.  Use in biocontrol  Feltiella acarisuga can be used to manage spider mite populations in a variety of greenhouse and field crops. Each midge larva can consume an average of least 15 adult mites, 30 mixed developmental stages, or 80 eggs per day. F. acarisuga has been extremely effective for controlling spider mites on tomato, pepper and cucumber. F. acarisuga is also used to manage spider mites on strawberries and various ornamental crops.

He was born in Charleston, West Virginia. Biography Lett is a 1969 graduate of Winfield High School in Winfield, West Virginia, where he played football and basketball and ran track. He earned All-State honors in basketball as the top scorer in the state and All-America honors in football as a quarterback. He is a 1973 graduate of the University of Kentucky, where he was selected to the All-Southeastern Conference baseball team in 1971. He also was a quarterback on the Wildcats football team. Lett earned a B.S. degree in Geography. Lett has worked in professional baseball as a player, coach, manager and front office executive in each of the last 32 years, having spent 24 of those years within the Cincinnati Reds organization (1973‚Äì96). He began his career as a player with Tampa Tarpons (a Reds' Minor league baseball team) in 1973. After playing three years of minor league baseball (1973‚Äì75) and compiling a .256 batting average, six home runs, and 110 RBI in 313 games, Lett began his managerial career with the Shelby Reds in the Western Carolinas League in 1977. He was selected as the league's Manager of the Year in 1978 after guiding the club to a second-place finish and a 75-64 record. Lett was a minor league manager in the Reds' chain from 1977 to 1985. He was the Reds' Bench Coach from 1986 to 1989 and again in 1996. He managed in the minors again in 1990, winning the lone South Atlantic League championship for the Charleston Wheelers, coached for the Nashville Sounds in 1991‚Äì92, and spent 1993‚Äì95 as the Reds' minor- league field coordinator. After leaving the Reds, Lett was a member of the Toronto Blue Jays coaching staff from 1997 to 1999. He was the Blue Jays' assistant director of player development in 2000. With the Los Angeles Dodgers, Lett served on Manager Jim Tracy's staff, as Bullpen Coach from 2001 through 2004 and as Bench Coach in 2005. On November 1, 2005, Lett was named the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bench Coach. In his role with the Pirates, Lett coordinated the day-to-day activities of the uniformed personnel with the manager, coaches, trainers and front office staff. He also acted as the club's catching instructor. When the Pirates fired Tracy in October 2007, Lett was encouraged to seek other forms of employment. Lett was not retained by the Pirates and subsequently was hired by the Milwaukee Brewers to coach for his hometown team, the Class-A West Virginia Power. The team plays its home games in downtown Charleston at Appalachian Power Park. While overseeing the Dodgers' bullpen in 2003, he helped guide the pen to a major-league low 2.46 ERA, the lowest mark by any bullpen since the 1990 Oakland Athletics posted a 2.35 ERA. The next year, Los Angeles relievers ranked second in the major leagues with a 3.06 ERA. In his tenure as a coach in the majors, Lett has worked with four Cy Young Award recipients: Toronto's Pat Hentgen (1996 winner), two-time winner Roger Clemens (1997‚Äì98) and Eric Gagn√© (2003). Lett also coached Hall of Fame reliever Trevor Hoffman in the minor leagues, helping to convert him from a shortstop to pitcher.https://www.espn.com/blog/the-gms- office/insider/post/_/id/13738/making-trevor-hoffman-a-pitcher-paid-off-for- him-not-for-mehttps://baseballhall.org/hof/hoffman-trevor  References  External links *Retrosheet Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Charleston, West Virginia Category:Baseball players from West Virginia Category:Players of American football from West Virginia Category:Kentucky Wildcats football players Category:Kentucky Wildcats baseball players Category:Cincinnati Reds coaches Category:Los Angeles Dodgers coaches Category:Major League Baseball bench coaches Category:Major League Baseball bullpen coaches Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:Pittsburgh Pirates coaches Category:Toronto Blue Jays coaches Category:Toronto Blue Jays executives Category:Washington Nationals coaches Category:Minor league baseball managers Category:Billings Mustangs managers Category:Gulf Coast Reds players Category:Tampa Tarpons (1957‚Äì1987) players Category:Trois-Rivi√®res Aigles players ","title":"Jim Lett"},{"id":"10788203","text":"The West African National Secretariat (WANS) was a Pan-Africanist movement founded by Kwame Nkrumah, based in Britain. Nkrumah founded WANS in December 1945, immediately following the Manchester Pan-African Congress, becoming the new organisation's Secretary-General. Other founder members included I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson (who was elected as Chairman), Bankole Akpata, Kojo Botsio and Bankole Awooner-Renner (the first President). Many of its initial members were also members of the West African Students' Union (WASU). WANS aimed to build a united movement throughout West Africa for independence, on a platform of anti-imperialism. Its view of West Africa was broad, and aimed to include countries as distant as Kenya and Sudan. A major congress was planned, but never came to fruition. Within WANS, Nkrumah organised a secret socialist revolutionary group, known as \\"The Circle\\". This group worked closely with the Communist Party of Great Britain. During 1946, WANS published five issues of a monthly journal, The New African, containing articles in English, French and Belgian, on West African issues, but also incorporating stories from the Moscow New Times. In September, WANS held a joint conference with WASU, which Nkrumah convinced L√©opold S√©dar Senghor and Sourou Migan Apithy to attend. WANS was considerably weakened after Nkrumah returned to Africa in 1947, and appears to have dissolved the following year.

For many years, it was a top 40 station. In the 1960s the call letters stood for \\"We're Anderson's Now Sound\\". Later...\\"We're Anderson's New Sound\\". WANS was paired up with 100,000-watt WANS-FM 107.3 (now WJMZ-FM) in the 1960s. Both stations had separate feeds and broadcast from studios located on Clemson Blvd. in Anderson. The two stations were wildly popular for many years. A large WANS- AM/FM sign was erected in front of the studios on Clemson Blvd. and advertised local Anderson stores and community events. In 1988, news studios were built beside the existing ones. After new ownership took over in 1990, declining ratings and loss of key staff caused a steep decline in ratings for both the AM and FM stations. In 1992, the stations went bankrupt. WANS-FM 107 was moved to Greenville, South Carolina. The WANS studios on Clemson Blvd. were sold. From 1992 to late 1993, WANS 1280 was operated from the transmitter site nearby. The station began simulcasting WFBC 1330's News/Talk feed out of Greenville, South Carolina. In late 1993, WRIX-AM-FM owner Matt Phillips purchased WANS and moved all operations back to Anderson. WANS-FM 107 soon changed call letters to WJMZ-FM. WANS 1280 aired The Matt and Bev Show from WRIX. WANS then played a mix of oldies music and standards for several years with live and local DJs such as Jerry Peeler's beach show & Jimmy Gilstrap's classic 60's & 70's rock-n-roll which was live every Saturday. In early 2000, the station became all Carolina Beach Oldies headed by longtime WANS DJ and manager Dann Scott. In 2005, the station went all Sports Talk from ESPN. Over the years it would also play other style talk shows. In 2013, it went to all Sports Talk again from Fox Sports. In November 2014, WANS flipped to a Classic Hits format and was simulcasted with WRIX-FM 103.1. Owner Tom Ervin donated WRIX-AM-FM and WANS to the Power Foundation out of Greenville, South Carolina that operates Southern Gospel Radio stations in other markets. In late February 2015, WANS was flipped to 1950s-1970s Oldies. It was then paired with a FM translator 107.7 FM. This put WANS back on FM for the first time since 1992. On March 1, 2015, the simulcast with WHQA (formerly WRIX-FM) 103.1 ended. WHQA flipped to a Southern gospel format, and WANS 1280 and 107.7 FM flipped to classic hits. Today, WANS is the sister station to WRIX & WHQA. In September 2008, the format was shifted from ESPN Sports/Talk to News/Talk, the former format and lineup of sister station WRIX-FM/103.1, which shifted to Adult Contemporary on the same day. WANS still broadcasts the ESPN Radio Network late at night and on weekends. WANS carried all Anderson Joes Baseball games live until the league went under. They broadcast many different sports from Anderson University and football games from Coastal Carolina University. They also air all of the Westside High School Ram football games. On January 25, 2013 WANS changed their format from news/talk to sports, with programming from Fox Sports Radio. Tom Ervin purchased WANS in 2013.http://andersonobserver.squarespace.com/news/2013/8/11/tom-ervin-brings- happy-new-beginnings-for-wrix-wans.html WANS celebrated 65 years on the air on June 1, 2014 with a radio special hosted by upstate radio veteran \\"Jazzy\\" Jeff Bright, host of The Greatest Hits on sister station WRIX-FM 103.1. On November 29, 2014 WANS changed their format from sports to classic hits, simulcasting WRIX-FM 103.1 Honea Path, South Carolina. The flip to 1950s-1970s Oldies and end of having the same feed as WHQA (formerly WRIX-FM) began on March 1, 2015. WANS is also back on FM with a translator.

New York: PolyGram Records. It was Brown and the Flames' second charting single, ending a two-year dry spell after the success of \\"Please, Please, Please\\". Background By 1958 James Brown's career was faltering. After disputes over royalties, songwriting credit, and the indignity of having been relegated to backup singers on the billing of \\"Please, Please, Please\\", most of the original Famous Flames (including founder Bobby Byrd) had walked out on him; only Johnny Terry remained. Brown continued to perform with a backing band and a new Flames lineup consisting of members of Little Richard's former vocal group, the Dominions. (\\"Big Bill\\" Hollings, Louis Madison, and J.W. Archer). They recorded more songs for Federal Records, but nine of their singles in a row failed to chart. On the way back to Macon, Georgia after a disappointing West Coast tour, Brown approached his guitar player Bobby Roach with a tune he said he had been given by a patron at the Million Dollar Palms, a Florida nightclub. After Roach crafted a guitar part for \\"Try Me\\", Brown and the Flames worked out the vocal harmonies together and cut a demo to send to label head Syd Nathan. Nathan was impressed with it and arranged for a recording session in New York with producer Andy Gibson and a group of seasoned session musicians.Smith, R.J. (2012). The One: The Life and Music of James Brown, 84-86. New York: Gotham Books. Despite the contributions of other people, Brown took the sole writing credit for the song. In his 1986 autobiography, Brown described \\"Try Me\\" as \\"really a pop tune. I had heard \\"Raindrops\\" by Dee Clark and \\"For Your Precious Love\\" by Jerry Butler and the Impressions, so I wrote my song to fit between them.\\"Brown, James, and Bruce Tucker (1986). James Brown: The Godfather of Soul, 91. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press. However, \\"Raindrops\\" was actually released more than two years after \\"Try Me\\". Reception Released in October 1958, the song became their first to crack the R&B; charts in three years and their first ever to crack the Billboard Hot 100 after their relative failure of \\"Please, Please, Please\\" peaking at number 5 on Billboard's Bubbling Under chart (or #105). The song peaked at number one on the R&B; chart in February of 1959 and reached number 48 on the Hot 100. The song sold over a million copies and saved the Famous Flames from having their contract dropped due to lack of hits following the original Famous Flames disbanding and Brown's struggles to deal with the group and their performances on the chitlin' circuit. The song was also the best-selling R&B; single of 1958, and its success gave Brown confidence in his own abilities as a musician and gave him the needs to build his career. \\"Try Me\\" was included on the albums Please Please Please and Try Me!.

The Iona Nunnery was an Augustinian convent located on the island of Iona in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. It was established sometime after the foundation of the nearby Benedictine monastery in 1203. Beth√≥c, daughter of Somerled, was first prioress. The ruins of the nunnery stand in a peaceful garden adjacent to Iona's main (and only) village, Baile Mor. They form the most complete remains of a medieval nunnery extant in Scotland. After the Reformation, the priory was dissolved and reduced to a ruin. History Iona Nunnery refectory. The nunnery was founded after the establishment of the Benedictine monastery, which was likely founded by Raghnall mac Somhairle in 1203. Raghnall's sister, Beth√≥c, became the first prioress. This was one of the two Augustinian nunneries in Scotland, St. Leonards Nunnery located at Perth being the other. In the Abbey museum of the nearby Iona Abbey, the top half of a headstone of Anna MacLean, a prioress of the monastery of nuns who died in 1543, is on display. Restoration work on the nunnery occurred in 1923 and 1993. Construction Iona Nunnery - church detail. The construction of the Iona Nunnery follows the typical Irish style. The Church consists of a building with three bays with a passage to the north side and a small chapel on the east side of the passage. The current monastery garden measures 14 metres square, but it was originally smaller. The east wing had three rooms on ground level, above was the dormitory. The south wing contained the refectory. In the sixteenth century a floor was added. The west wing is below the modern road and was most likely the guests wing.

History  The Old Tote began in a converted tin shed on the campus of University of New South Wales in Sydney. The wood and corrugated iron building (originally an army recreation hall) became known as the \\"Old Tote\\" because it had previously been part of the group of buildings that had formerly housed the totalisator betting machine when the site had been Kensington Racecourse.

This was followed by a double bill of The Bald Prima Donna and The Fire Raisers, with a cast that including Brian James, Gwen Plumb, Neil Fitzpatrick, Anna Volska and Jack Allan. Other productions in the first season included Hamlet, with John Bell in the title role, and Playboy of the Western World.

In May 1969 the company moved to a temporary venue, the Parade Theatre, on the western side of the UNSW campus on Anzac Parade, which was about twice the size of the Old Tote and had a larger stage. In 1968 a decision was made to separate the Old Tote Company and NIDA. With a subsidy from the newly created Australian Council for the Arts The Old Tote then embarked on a policy of expansion and at the request of the state government it took on the responsibilities of a state theatre company, which led to commitments to stage productions at both the Sydney Opera House and the Seymour Centre as well as at the Parade. The Old Tote company went on to occupy the Drama Theatre of the Sydney Opera House from 1973 to 1978 and also toured some of the shows around Australia, including Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead to the Canberra Theatre Centre. However these additional activities, compounded by lack of support from the New South Wales state government, overstretched the company's resources and in 1978 the Old Tote went into liquidation.

This was mainly achieved by hiring the services of Horton Investments, an Iranian consultancy firm owned by Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, son of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani. Horton Investments was paid US$15.2 million by Statoil to influence important political figures in Iran to grant oil contracts to Statoil. The corruption scandal was uncovered by Norwegian paper Dagens N√¶ringsliv on September 3, 2003. Although this case became infamous in the western media and Statoil was found guilty by the Norwegian courts no verdict was reported by the Iranian side regarding Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani's bribery case. Verdict reached by the Norwegian court On June 29, 2004 Statoil was found guilty of corruption by the Norwegian courts and ordered to pay NOK 20 million in fines. The Director for international operations Richard John Hubbard was also ordered to pay NOK 200,000 in fines for his involvement in the case. The uncovering of the corruption scandal also led to the resignation of Statoil Chairman Leif Terje L√∏ddes√∏l, Statoil CEO Olav Fjell and Director for international operations Richard John Hubbard. The charges against Olav Fjell were dropped owing to insufficient evidence. Statoil agreed to pay the fines, but insisted that this did not imply any admittance of guilt on its part. Verdict reached by the US court On October 13, 2006 Statoil reached a settlement with US authorities for its involvement in the case and was ordered by a US court to pay US$21 million in fines. As part of the settlement agreement, Statoil had to agree to the following counts: 1\\\\. Statoil agreed that it had paid bribes to an Iranian public servant in June 2002 and January 2003, with the aim of securing contracts for Statoil in the development of stage 6,7,8 of the South Pars gas field in Iran. 2\\\\. Statoil agreed that bribes were paid to secure other contracts in the country, and to get hold of confidential information. 3\\\\. Statoil agreed that it had used wrong accounting procedures in order to hide the bribes from its records. The settlement also stipulated that no Statoil employee or representative for the company could make any statements to the media that contradicted the verdict for the next three years. Views on the verdicts Former Iranian ambassador to Norway, and defector, Perviz Khazai, criticized Statoil strongly for its business methods in Iran. In a statement he said that, This smells to high heavens of corruption. And this incident can contribute to the tarnishing of Norway's reputation. He also went on record to say that the Rafsanjani family were known for their close links to corruption. Jan Borgen of Transparency International Norway was also highly critical of Statoil's conduct in Iran. When asked to make a comment on the case by Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten, he said, It is true that you can hardly get into these countries without using agents or advisers. But here, like anywhere else, you should know your agents. It is always dangerous to get involved with a consultant who has close contacts to the political elite..\\" Helge Lund, who succeeded Olav Fjell as CEO of Statoil, has also publicly admitted that the corruption scandal tarnished Statoil and Norway's reputation abroad.

Early life and military career Alvanley was the son of Richard Arden, 1st Baron Alvanley and Anne Wilbraham-Bootle. Initially pursuing a career as an officer in the British Army, he purchased an ensigncy in the Coldstream Guards. He was promoted to captain in March 1809.London Gazette, no. 16243, 4 April 1809 He later transferred to the 50th (Queen's Own) Regiment of Foot, and exchanged to the half-pay of the 100th Regiment of Foot on 1 September 1812.London Gazette, no. 16639, 29 August 1812 Owing to his subsequent debts, he was forced to dispose of his half-pay on 10 June 1826.London Gazette, no. 18256, 10 June 1826 He later served in the Forest Troop, King's Regiment of Cheshire Yeomanry Cavalry, as a cornet, but resigned on 17 January 1840.London Gazette, no. 19817, 24 January 1840 Regency buck Lord Alvanley was a prominent Regency buck and member of the Prince Regent's circle, and was friends with Beau Brummell. He was popular in society and regarded as wittiest man of his day. He, Brummell, Henry Mildmay, and Henry Pierrepoint were considered the prime movers of Watier's club, dubbed \\"the Dandy Club\\" by Lord Byron. They were also the four hosts of the July 1813 masquerade ball at which the Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint, but then \\"cut\\" Brummell and Mildmay by snubbing them, staring them in the face but not speaking to them. Brummell then said to Alvanley, \\"Alvanley, who's your fat friend?\\". The Prince Regent was not amused; this incident was the final and most public sign that Brummell was no longer favored by \\"Prinny\\". Alvanley continued to support Brummell, sending money to his friend during Brummell's exile in France. In 1835, Alvanley fought a duel with Morgan O'Connell. According to a near contemporary report, \\"[Alvanley] went through the business with the most perfect sang froid, but on his way to the field he whimsically intimated a singular alarm. Having descended a hollow, 'My Lord', said he to his second, 'you get me down well enough, but', alluding to his full size, 'should I fall, I do not know how the devil you will ever get me up again.'\\"The Mirror of literature, amusement, and instruction, Volume V, Aird and Burstall, London. 1844 p. 185 He had an extremely lavish lifestyle, funded by income generated by the estates that his father had bought. His prominent position in society also allowed him to float a line of credit and became widely known as a spendthrift. However, his debts became untenable and eventually his family estates had to be sold to pay them off. Underbank Hall in Stockport was sold by auction in 1823 and most of the Bredbury estate was sold in lots in 1825. In 1827 he sold the Willington Estate to Waterloo veteran William Tomkinson, land that would become the site of Willington Hall. The Arden Hall mansion was sold in 1833. He eventually resigned his membership of White's. The death of George IV in 1830 saw Alvanley's society position deteriorate, which was furthered hampered by his limited income. He occasionally contributed to debates in the House of Lords. He did not marry and had no children. On his death, the title went to his only brother, the Colonel Hon. Richard Arden.John Bernard Burke (editor). The St. James's magazine: and heraldic and historical register, Volume 2, 1850. p. 20, \\"Obituary for October and November (1849)\\" In popular culture Alvanley was portrayed by William Humphrey in the 1924 historical drama film Beau Brummel and by Maurice Kaufmann in the 1954 film of the same name.

It is loosely based on the 1988 election campaign for the president of the United States and features characters based on actual candidates and other politicians. The game was conceived and directed by Shintaro Ito, who was a newscaster for CNN Daywatch at the time. Gameplay At the start of the game, the player has four different issues to take either a liberal, conservative, or centrist position on. The player must make wise use of his funds as he is trying to become the President of the United States of America. Being liberal offends the religious folks, being conservative offends the university students and working class voters, and being centrist (as in pleasing everybody) actually pleases nobody. The player starts in February 1988 at a convention for his political party somewhere in the Midwestern United States. and must work his way up to the final election results on November 1988 without becoming bankrupt. In the presently unknown primary election, candidates in five states (including players) make the final selection along with the decision-making. Opinion polls and election campaigns (speeches) do benefit the player in his presidential campaign. However, the primary elections in are not implemented in all states in the same way. Some states may be processed automatically by computer (a fixed number of delegate count) while others in a more manual way. The Super Tuesday primaries are to be held on the same day in many states, ballot counting is done after the player has made simultaneous attempts in each campaign state into three regions. After that, the primary election is made (not counting district units held, subject to the provisions of the delegate count.) The priorities of the policies that the player can make were introduced to the game as the situation was in 1988 because of the Soviet Union and the CoCom. In 1991, the dissolution of the Soviet Union would eventually lead to CoCom being disbanded in 1994. South Africa had an apartheid regime at the time and abolished in it 1991. The Panama Canal Zone was returned in 1999 to the people of Panama. However, it differs from the political situation encountered in the game. The \\"AIDS patient isolation\\" issue was showing an event of discriminatory policy of an era that had not shown wide public awareness about how the AIDS virus manages to spread from person to person. If the player manages to win the game and become President of the United States, the official Presidential Oath is displayed in English.

The Stinson Model A was a moderately successful airliner of the mid-1930s. It was one of the last commercial airliners designed in the United States with a fabric-covered steel tube fuselage before the introduction of stressed skin aluminum construction. Design and development A total of 30 Stinson Model As were built until production ceased in 1936. It was one of many promising designs whose commercial success was cut short by the introduction of the stressed-skin Boeing 247 and Douglas DC-2.HO Aircraft, (18 June 2015) \\"Stinson Model A: Restoring a Classic Aircraft\\" Disciples of Flight. Retrieved 24 August 2015. Operational history =Australia= Because the waiting lists for either the new Boeing or Douglas aircraft were already too long Airlines of Australia (AOA) ordered three Stinson Model As in January 1936. These aircraft were VH- UGG Lismore (arrived per s.s. City of Winchester on 27 March), VH-UHH Brisbane (arrived per s.s. Wichita on 22 June) and VH-UKK Townsville (arrived 22 July in the s.s. City of Manilla). All three were quickly reassembled and entered the Sydney - Brisbane service, proving so successful that in August AOA ordered a fourth example VH-UYY Grafton ‚Äì the very last Stinson Model A to be built ‚Äì which arrived at Sydney on board s.s. Port Alma on 14 December. With posturing from both AOA and Australian National Airways (ANA) to cut into each other‚Äôs turf by late 1936, early efforts by ANA to gain a controlling interest in AOA failed, until the tragic losses of VH-UHH Brisbane in the McPherson Ranges on 19 February 1937 and VH-UGG Lismore on 28 March halved AOA‚Äôs main- line fleet. A merger took effect in March 1937, although the two companies retained separate identities until AOA was formally absorbed into ANA on 1 July 1942. The two surviving Stinsons were then renamed VH-UKK Binana and VH- UYY Tokana, in conformity with ANA nomenclature.Job, Macarthur (1992). Air Crash, volume 2, Ch.2 During the Second World War spare parts for the Stinsons' aging Lycoming R-680 engines were impossible to obtain in Australia and it was decided to re-engine both aircraft with a Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp engine on each wing and eliminate the engine on the nose. The additional power allowed both aircraft to fly faster and carry heavier loads, although fuel dumps had to be fitted to allow them to remain under their maximum landing weight of , in case of an emergency necessitating landing shortly after take-off. On completion at Essendon, Victoria in May 1943, Binana returned to the Brisbane-Cairns, Queensland run, while Tokana was similarly converted and re-entered service in October on the run between Melbourne (Essendon), Kerang, Victoria, Mildura, Victoria and Broken Hill, New South Wales. Binana was later transferred to the Melbourne-Tasmania service. On the morning of 31 January 1945 Tokana was on the Essendon to Kerang leg of its regular service when the port wing separated in flight between Redesdale and Heathcote, fifty miles north of Melbourne. The aircraft then plunged to the ground, killing both crew and the full load of eight passengers. An investigation revealed that metal fatigue had developed in the wing‚Äôs lower main spar boom attachment socket, the actual failure possibly being instigated by the aircraft encountering a particularly heavy gust of wind. It was the first known occurrence of this type of accident in an aircraft anywhere in the world, but it was to become a problem all too common in later years where progressively larger aircraft would be built from light-weight alloys that were more susceptible to the underlying metallurgical phenomenon. It being assumed that the same problems could occur in Binana, its certificate of airworthiness was cancelled, and the old aircraft was subsequently broken up. A non-flying scale replica was built for a 1987 television movie account of the 1937 McPherson Ranges disaster, The Riddle of the Stinson, in which two survivors of the crash were rescued by Bernard O'Reilly.Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970-1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p131 =Outside Australia= Outside Australia, examples of the Stinson Model A remained in service in such far-flung corners of the globe as Korea and Alaska for some years. One example still survives, having crashed in Alaska in 1947, recovered and rebuilt in 1979, it passed to the Alaska Aviation Heritage Museum in 1988 and then to Greg Herrick's Golden Wings Flying Museum in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The aircraft is now located at the Mid America Flight Museum-Ohio Wing in Urbana, Ohio.

It is considered a noxious weed of economic importance in many of the western United States. It is native to Asia and East Europe (Russia and Ukraine) and Southeast Europe (Romania). Growth The Syrian bean-caper grows long, thin stems with few oval-shaped, fleshy, waxy green leaflets each 2 to 3 centimeters in length. The flowers are small, compact bunches of five petals each with prominent stamens. The flowers have a taste and scent similar to caper. It grows in masses of individual plants, forming colonies, especially in dry, gravelly, saline, or disturbed areas where other plant life is rare. Characteristics The plant has invasive potential due to its long taproot which, even if fragmented, can produce a new plant, as well as the hardy wax coating on its leaves that tends to protect it from herbicides.

She is Professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She served as president of the International Association for Feminist Economics (IAFFE) from 2002 to 2003, she has been an associate editor of the journal Feminist Economics since 1995, and she is also a member of the editorial board of the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy. She delivered the inaugural Ailsa McKay Lecture in 2016. Focus Folbre focuses on the economics of care, which she defines as, \\"work that involves connecting to other people, trying to help people meet their needs, things like the work of caring for children, caring for the elderly, caring for sick people or teaching is a form of caring labor,\\" and she adds that caring labor can be paid or unpaid.Folbre, Nancy ‚ÄúCaring Labor.‚Äù Transcription of a video by Oliver Ressler, recorded in Amherst, U.S.A., 20 min., 2003. Folbre argues that mainstream economists do not pay enough attention to the economics of care. This is detrimental to women because the exclusion of non-market and care work from mainstream economic analysis can marginalize women and children and undervalue their contributions to the home and the community. Care is a unique form of work because it is \\"intrinsically motivated,\\" in that not just money motivates people to care. Folbre argues that care work has been historically undervalued because it has been historically provided by women at low or no cost, and goes far to explain why women earn less than men. To this end, Folbre questions why women would even take care jobs and argues that the social construction of femininity links femininity and care. Folbre argues that only by working collectively to ensure a greater supply and quality of care, independent of the market, can we ensure that the responsibility of care is equitably distributed and not disproportionately placed upon women. In her well-known book The Invisible Heart, Folbre explores the market and the individualistic competition that it engenders, and argues that the necessary care of elders and children is not provided in the market, yet is still absolutely necessary for society. Historically women have provided this care, whether as non-market work or low-paying market work. Folbre examines the social and governmental structures that support and provide for care, and their evolution throughout history. She concludes with the answer that we all have a responsibility to care for others, and provides a vision for the future in which care and care work are given greater priority and support. Folbre has also written extensively on the social organization of time, namely the time allotted to care for children and the elderly and how family policies and social institutions limit the choices people can make between paid and unpaid work. Folbre kept the blog 'Care Talk: coordinating research on care provision' from 2008 to 2009. She is a contributor to the New York Times Economix blog, an opportunity she has said she relishes because, \\"most academics spend a lot of time writing stuff that very few people will ever read.\\" Education Folbre received a B.A. in philosophy from the University of Texas at Austin in 1971, an M.A. in Latin American studies from UT Austin in 1973, and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1979. Professional achievements Folbre was awarded a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship by the Yale University Economic Growth center in 1979-1980. From 1995-1996 she received the French-American Foundation Fellowship for teaching and research in Paris. In 1999 she was awarded the Olivia Shieffelin Nordberg Award for Excellence in Writing and Editing in the Population Sciences, and in April 2004 she was named the Charlotte Perkins Gilman Fellow at the American Academy of Political and Social Science. In 1989 Folbre was awarded a National Science Foundation grant to study Women's Work and Women's Households in Western Massachusetts between 1880-1910. She was awarded a five- year fellowship with the MacArthur Foundation in 1998, and the Leontief Prize of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University in 2004. Professional involvements Folbre sits on the editorial board of the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy. She was elected president of the International Association for Feminist Economics in 2002, and has been an associate editor of the journal Feminist Economics since 1995. As of 2004 she was a member of the National Academy of Science Panel, which studied the design of non-market accounts. She has been a board member of the Foundation for Child Development since 2000, a member of the National Advisory Commission of Child Care and Early Education as well as the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund since 2004. Books =Who Pays for the Kids? Gender and the Structures of Constraint (1994)= In this book, Folbre discusses how women's transition from the role of primary providers of care work to market-related production presents women with dilemmas. Even with women entering the paid labor force in growing numbers, they are still expected to perform most of the unpaid domestic labor. Women must choose how to divide their time between personal development and fulfillment and the expectations imposed by social norms. An increasing number of single mothers struggle with little or no support from estranged fathers, and while government subsidies may be available, they often only account for a portion of the support that once took place within families. Folbre analyzes this situation through three major foci. First, she attempts to show that mainstream economics have failed to provide adequate models to explain relations between parents and children in terms of development, conflict and social welfare. She suggests that economists should pay less attention to mere accounting of production and more on social reproduction. Second, Folbre explores how a shift in the investment of time and resources toward children might result in losses for other groups. Understanding and addressing these conflicts between groups might lead to more efficient and satisfying means to providing care of children and the elderly. Finally, she examines what history has to say about the collective struggles over the costs of social reproduction. =The Ultimate Field Guide to the U.S. Economy (2000)= Along with James Heintz and other contributors from the Center for Popular Economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Folbre and her co-authors use wit and wisdom to expose the misconceptions about and uncover the realities of the U.S. economy. Each page addresses a single issue or concept that is accompanied by a cartoon or other artwork. While the book is written in simple, jargon-free language, the authors also have included a detailed glossary to help readers navigate through the economics terminology. This highly accessible book covers a wide spectrum of topics, including race and gender inequalities, labor issues, education, welfare, health government spending. =The Invisible Heart: Economics and Family Values (2001)= Measuring the value of care work is principally difficult because relationships of care are partly exchange transactions, and partly transactions involving what Folbre calls \\"the invisible heart.\\" This metaphor represents family values of love and economic reciprocity, which she contrasts with Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand,\\" in which the market forces of supply and demand exist alongside the pursuit of self-interest. While the forces of the free market and competitive individualism dominates public life, the forces of compassion must temper the forces of self-interest. Under the premise that people are rational optimizers, Folbre argues that if it is costly to be caring, people can be expected to engage in it less over time. If the opportunity cost of devoting time to family over a career is perceived to be high, or if proving care for the poor or sick pays poorly, then rational decision-makers will increasingly come to avoid care work. Folbre applauds the rising autonomy of women but argues that if we don't establish thoughtful rules defining our collective responsibilities for caregiving, the penalties suffered by the needy will increase. Intensified economic competition may drive altruism and families out of business. The book is divided into three sections, in which Folbre explores a wide range of issues, from the view of the housekeeping state to the rights of pregnant workers in Mexico. Using a storytelling voice, she tells a sequence of wonderful stories of her own extended family and acquaintances in San Antonio. Folbre views corporations as profit-obsessed and corrupt tyrants and often sees governments as bloated bureaucratic regimes that serve few and punish the poor. While regressive taxation assures that some will be able to afford more care than others, unequal school funding guarantees class inequality. Folbre compares the traditional role of women with the more contemporary career-oriented position of women. Where women have traditionally provided care within the home, this responsibility is slowly transitioning to third parties and corporate institutions. Profit motives will tend to drive the wages of care workers down. She notes that turnover rates among childcare staff are often in excess of 30 percent per year. According to Folbre, such under-provision of quality care is due to the mismatch between care's relational and public-good nature, as well as an economic system that stresses competition and individuality. Folbre argues that radical changes to the way Americans live and work, democratic control of the economy, as well as a dramatic redistribution of wealth will strengthen the ethic of solidarity and social reciprocity. She concludes with a resounding call‚Äîto extend family values to society as a whole‚Äîand a series of policy proposals for increasing both the quality and the recognition of care. =Family Time: The Social Organization of Care (2004)= Edited by Nancy Folbre and Michael Bittman, this book contains a collection of eleven essays discussing a variety of topics related to child and elder care. Folbre's contributions include an introduction and three co- authored chapters. In her article entitled \\"A theory of the misallocation of time\\" (a play upon Gary Becker's article of a similar title), Folbre critiques Becker's neoclassical theory of gender specialization in the household. She also co-authors two additional chapters regarding the measurement of parental childcare time and nonparental care. =Valuing Children: Rethinking the Economics of the Family (2008)= In this book, Folbre discusses the costs of raising children, the value of child care to the economy, and how these costs are borne by society. She challenges the implicit view of mainstream economists who effectively view the raising of children as a process of consumption in which parents can derive happiness and how this view ignores the fact that children become the workers and taxpayers of the next generation. She argues that the time investment mothers make offers significant rewards in the reproduction of labor, and because of this, public policy should be designed to align private and public resources in promoting efficient commitments to the next generation. Folbre considers ways to improve the accounting of the economic value of raising children and how the current methods of calculating the economic cost of having children fail to capture the value of the time spent in care work. Folbre provides a surprising estimate of the value of parental time per child by asking what it would cost to purchase a comparable substitute for it. Yet she also argues that, as part of the non-market sector, care work is economically undervalued by simply utilizing its replacement cost. =Greed, Lust and Gender: A History of Economic Ideas (2009)= Written shortly after the financial crash of 2008, Folbre explores how the boundaries between the pursuit of self-interest and immorality have become blurred. She argues that the mentality espoused by Oliver Stone's character Gordon Gecko that \\"greed is good,\\" helped lead to the 2008 crash and persists in its wake. Yet, the same social norms that consider aggression, greed and lust an advantage to men in public life also view such things as perverse in women. Folbre argues that this double standard often puts aspiring women in a difficult position, which forces women to choose between their personal identity and the acceptance of the expected gender role. Folbre brings women's work, their sexuality, and their ideas into the center of the dialectic between economic history and the history of economic ideas. Her book describes a process of economic and cultural change in the United States, Great Britain and France that shaped the evolution of patriarchal capitalism and the welfare state. Selected Journal Articles =The Cost of Caring (with Paula England) (1999)= Care providers require a variety of skills ‚Äì from nursing and physical therapy to teaching and emotional counseling. Yet, these jobs rarely offer wages commensurate with their requirements for education and skill. Folbre and England discuss the struggle for recognition of what has traditionally been viewed as \\"women's work\\", and how providing these services constitutes a public good whose beneficiaries pay almost nothing. For many who provide care, the greatest compensation comes only from the satisfaction of altruism. In the end, society is uncomfortable assigning a price to something this sacred and that this reluctance limits the pay of those who provide it. =Measuring Care: Gender, Empowerment and the Care Economy (2006)= A number of indices have been established to quantify women's development, health, well-being and the role that they play in their respective economies. Among these are the Gender Development Index (GDI) and the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM) used by the United Nations Human Development Report Office and the Gender Inequality Index developed by Social Watch. In this article, Folbre explores the strengths and weaknesses of these indices and proposes new indices that take greater account of the care economy. She reflects upon specific care work activities that have measurable effects on the reproduction of labor, and discusses ways to integrate the process of care, rather than merely the outcome of care work. In many ways, this article is also a study in methodology. In proposing new metrics, she discusses a number of hurdles that researchers face in gathering data. For example, she suggests ways to use census data related to general household spending to extrapolate information on dependency ratios. Folbre debates the use and construction of time use surveys and their relation to the valuation of care work. =Children as Public Goods (1994)= In this short article, Folbre argues that because present workers support the elderly, today's children are a public good needed for the future support of current adults. She asserts that the raising of children imposes costs that are not borne evenly throughout society, and that those who invest little into this public good are \\"free-riders\\". To build her case, Folbre begins by describing the impact of economic development on the opportunity costs of having children. In a traditional patriarchal society, the social norms place serious restrictions on women's ability to make a living outside of marriage. This lowers the opportunity costs of having children and heightens the utility of children ‚Äì who are often sent to work at a very young age. This typically leads to higher fertility and an unspoken pact of responsibility between parents and their children. However, the growth of labor markets and increased geographic mobility has seen an increase in the independence of women and a weakening of patriarchal property rights. In developed countries, compulsory education and restrictions on child labor have increased the costs to parents. As a result, these parents find it easier to default on the implicit contract of family. Nevertheless, Folbre points out that people do not respond to changes in the cost of children quickly, and those that choose family life are more likely to experience economic hardship ‚Äì particularly single women. Policy makers in Europe and the United States recognized the decline of care for elderly family members and began introducing policies to fill the growing void. Folbre notes how this may have led to rent-seeking behavior among the elderly, and as a consequence, transfers from the young to the old have increased at the very time when the cost of child care is increasing. As policy focuses more heavily upon the elderly, the failure to support commitments to child care weakens the social norms that uphold the reproduction of future workers. Folbre discusses and briefly critiques solutions posed by others and concludes with a call for compensation for parents and job training for young adults. =Improper Acts: Sex in Classical Political Economy (1992)= In this article, Folbre discusses how the matter of sexuality was implicit in classical British political economy. Bernard Mandeville, Adam Smith, and Robert Malthus accepted conventional standards of family law and sexual morality as given, yet they underestimated the influence of rational self-interest on the practice of sexual intercourse. In some cases, they argued against its application there. Yet, at least some political economists contested prevailing social norms and religious views. Jeremy Bentham defended the legitimacy of sex as a form of recreation and protested the persecution of homosexuals, and Francis Place actively promoted contraception. These dissenters, advocates of \\"improper arts,\\" deserve more recognition than they have traditionally received. By insisting that rational self-interest should rule reproduction as well as production, they expanded the scope of political economy. =The Future of the Elephant Bird (1997)= In this article, Folbre builds upon ideas offered by Kingsley Davis in his 1937 article \\"Reproductive institutions and the pressure for population.\\" Davis laments the growing divide between the family and modern social institutions. Folbre examines the connection between social changes and John Caldwell's work on the demographic transition observed in the United States in the 1970s. She expands the discussion by noting the importance of distributional conflict within the family ‚Äì how the capitalist labor market forced a change in the traditionally patriarchal family relationships. As many functions of the family, such as childcare and education, are shifted to the public sector, the role of parental authority has weakened. She notes how private and governmental retirement planning has slowly replaced intergenerational reciprocity and how employers invest in the human capital of their workers, much as parents once did. The title of the article refers to the Dr. Seuss book Horton Hatches the Egg, in which Horton, the elephant, serves as a surrogate parent for a bird. To illustrate the main theme of her argument, Folbre uses the story of Horton as an allegory for the changing relationship between parents and children. The mother bird entrusts Horton to warm her egg while she takes an extended vacation, only to find that the egg has hatched in her absence and her chick sees Horton as it mother. While Folbre sees the departure of the mother bird as a potential moral issue, she takes issue with Davis's utilitarian view of materialist functionalism. By this view, all social institutions are evaluated in terms of costs and benefits ‚Äì even to the point where investments of affection are weighed against the potential for reciprocity. She recognizes the benefits of the mother bird's increased autonomy (and perhaps the inevitability of the trend), but concludes her article with a call for collective responsibility for caring for others. By taking turns \\"sitting on the nest,\\" society would embrace a moral vision that values the reproduction of labor rather than merely the fruits of labor. =Other publications= * * ::Also available as: * * Honours Nancy Folbre was selected to deliver the inaugural Ailsa McKay Lecture in 2016.

The partners of the NBCNC were Stephen Tingley, Senator James Reid and John Irving. She was launched on August 3, 1896 and christened by James Reid's wife after whom she'd been named. Soda Creek to Quesnel The Charlotte was built to serve the route from Soda Creek to Quesnel on the upper Fraser River and was a far superior craft than either of her predecessors, the Enterprise and the Victoria which had worked that route during the 1860s through to the 1880s. The Charlotte's first captain was Frank Odin. Due to her late launch, her first season was a short one and nearly disastrous. In mid November, Odin had taken her for one last run from Quesnel to Soda Creek and was on the way back when he discovered that ice was running down the river. Odin was forced to tie her up at Steamboat Landing near Alexandria, right in front of where the old hulk of the Victoria was. Not wanting to leave the Charlotte in the frozen river over the winter, her owners decided to buy the wreck from its owner, Robert McLeese, so the Charlotte could be safely berthed in her place. For the next twelve years the Charlotte faithfully plied the route between Soda Creek and Quesnel, delivering the mail and other cargo for the pioneer communities. Her owners saw little need to take her any further north and risk her in the Cottonwood or Fort George canyons. However, by 1907, it was widely known that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway would be coming through the province via the Yellowhead Pass and would be going right through Fort George. Tingley, Reid and Irving began considering the feasibility of extending the Charlotte's route further north. Though the Enterprise had successfully navigated those two canyons on her historic trip to Takla Lake thirty-six years earlier, the Charlotte's owners knew that in no ways guaranteed that a regular route could be maintained without great risk. The town of Quesnel was also planning to build a river steamer, one that would be launched for the season of 1909. Local man, Captain DA Foster was to be her pilot and upon inspecting the canyons in the fall of '07, he petitioned the federal government for funds to remove the obstacles to navigation. His petition was granted and he received $13,000 for this purpose and personally supervised the clean-up of the two canyons. In light of these improvements and the news of the impending railway, the Charlotte's owners gave her an overhaul, widening the bores of her engine and replacing her old manual capstan with a powerful steam-driven one. During this period they also hired Captain Owen Forrester Browne to be her pilot. Throughout the navigating season of '08, Captain Browne took the Charlotte to the foot of the Cottonwood Canyon several times and became familiar with the area. Finally, after much consultation with some of the local First Nation's men, Browne decided to attempt the trip. Soda Creek to Fort George A dangerous moment: breaking of the ringbolt On the Charlotte's first trial attempt through the canyons in the fall of 1908, Captain Browne was joined by one of the Charlotte's owners, Captain Irving. Armed with her powerful new capstan and a good supply of dry cordwood, the Charlotte was taken to the foot of the Cottonwood Canyon where her crew attached a line to a newly placed ringbolt and Browne began to line her through. She had nearly reached the head of the canyon, when the ringbolt gave way and the Charlotte went crashing backwards through the canyon. Captain Browne reacted quickly to the crisis, guiding the Charlotte narrowly past a pile of rocks where she would've been torn open and immediately sank. After the near accident, Browne and Irving returned to Quesnel and put their own petition in to the government for funds, this time to blast away a large rock that was confining the current in the Cottonwood Canyon. Browne was sure that once this menace was removed, the canyon could be navigated. The funds were issued and the canyon was ready for the '09 season of navigation. By that spring the Charlotte was joined by two other river steamers, the Quesnel, that Captain Foster had been planning, and the Nechacco, owned by the Fort George Lumber and Navigation Company. All three steamers were able to navigate the full route from Soda Creek to South Fort George. By 1910, three others had joined the fleet, the BX, Chilcotin and Fort Fraser. The Charlotte met with several small accidents that summer and then one major one on the 15th of July, when she hit a reef in the Fort George Canyon and sank. The damage was so extensive that it was October before she was salvaged and taken to Quesnel. Upon assessing the cost of repairing her, and knowing that the little pioneer steamer couldn't compete against the bigger and more modern BX, her owners decided that any further investment in her couldn't be justified and she was abandoned on the riverbank at Quesnel.

In England, South Africa and the West Indies, first-class cricket was entirely abandoned for the whole of the war, whilst in Australia and New Zealand regular competitions were played for the 1914‚Äì15 season but first-class matches were afterwards abandoned. In South Africa, first-class cricket did not recommence until a series of matches against the Australian Imperial Forces cricket team in late 1919, and provincial cricket was not played until a one-off match between Transvaal and Natal in April 1920. At least 210 first-class cricketers are known to have joined the armed forces, of whom 34 were killed. The obituary sections of Wisden between 1915 and 1919 contained the names of hundreds of players and officials of all standards who died in the service of their country. Abandonment of first-class cricket With war looming in August, cricketers with military commitments, such as Sir Archibald White, the Yorkshire skipper, left their teams to do their duty, and Pelham Warner and Arthur Carr, who captained Middlesex and Nottinghamshire respectively, followed when war was declared. The County Championship was not immediately abandoned, the MCC issuing a statement that \\"no good purpose can be saved at the moment by cancelling matches\\" on 6 August, but attendances plummeted. Jack Hobbs, who had scored a career best 226 in front of over 14,000 spectators on 3 August, had to rearrange his benefit match from the Oval, after it was requisitioned by the Army, to Lord's and on 13 August the MCC announced that all matches arranged at Lord's up to September would be postponed. News of casualties suffered by the British Expeditionary Force in Belgium was already turning the public mood against \\"business as usual\\" and on 27 August a letter written by W.G. Grace was published in The Sportsman in which he declared that \\"I think the time has arrived when the county cricket season should be closed, for it is not fitting at a time like this that able-bodied men should be playing cricket by day and pleasure-seekers look on. I should like to see all first- class cricketers of suitable age set a good example and come to the help of their country without delay in its hour of need.\\" The remaining matches in the Championship were abandoned \\"in deference to public opinion\\" while the MCC closed the Scarborough Festival as \\"the continuation of first-class cricket is hurtful to the feelings of a section of the public\\". The last match to be completed, on 2 September, pitted Sussex against Yorkshire at Hove. \\"The men's hearts were barely in the game\\", the periodical Cricket reported at the time, \\"and the match was given up as a draw at tea.\\" The last match played, twenty five years and a day later, before the abandonment of first-class cricket due to World War II saw the same teams facing each other on the same ground. W. G. Grace, who had called for the early abandonment of cricket in his letter to The Sportsman, was reputed to shake his fist at the Zeppelins floating over his South London home. When chided by a friend who pointed out that the fast bowling of Ernie Jones had not discomforted him half so much, Grace replied testily \\"But I could SEE him!\\" Grace had played his second-last match, at the age of 66, for Eltham against Grove Park on 25 July 1914, scoring an unbeaten 69 out of 155 for six declared. He died of a stroke on 23 October 1915. Cricket continues While first-class cricket had been cancelled in the major cricketing nations, cricket itself continued around the world. In England, the Oval and Lord's hosted a number of matches between representative services sides, Army regiments and other service units. Club cricket continued, especially in the north of England, where the Lancashire League played in each summer without a break. Geese were kept on the grass at Lord's while the pavilion at Old Trafford was transformed into a Red Cross hospital. In four years, 1,800 patients were treated there, with beds occupying every possible space, including corridors and stairway landings. Anzac soldiers played improvised games cricket under shellfire on Shell Green in Gallipoli in 1915. The Australians played a game in view of the Turks to give the impression of normality and confidence while the entire force was being secretly evacuated from the beach area. Robert Graves recounts a game between officers and sergeants at Vermelles in France in 1915, when a bird cage with a dead parrot inside was used as the wicket. The game was abandoned when German machine gun fire at an aeroplane caused falling bullets to land dangerously close to the pitch. Cricket was played overseas, often in fund raising matches. A game involving an English XII against an Indian team held at the Bombay Gymkhana in December 1915 for war relief was watched by 40,000 people. J. G. Greig scored 216 and Frank Tarrant took 9 for 35. The only first-class cricketer to be awarded the Victoria Cross was John Smyth, for conspicuous gallantry with the 15th Ludhiana Sikhs in India in 1915. He also received the Military Cross and was decorated by the Russians. He played his 2 matches for the Europeans at Lahore, making 3 and 19 in the first and taking a wicket while posting 51 and 27 in the second. He was invalided out the army in the Second World War and became a Conservative MP, being created a Baronet in 1955 and a Privy Counsellor in 1962. Cricket raised funds in other ways. George Robey, the \\"Prime Minister of Mirth\\", auctioned cricket memorabilia, including bats used by W.G. Grace, to raise funds for St. Dunstan's Hostel for Blind Servicemen. Some cricket was still played in England, with the Australian Imperial Forces, featuring Charlie Macartney, playing an English Army XI at Lord's in July 1917. Lord's was also the scene for a baseball match between American and Canadian teams watched by 10,000 with the proceeds going to the Canadian Widows and Orphans Fund. Club cricket continued to the extent that it could, with large crowds attending the matches. Lord Harris, captain of England in the first English Test natch in 1880, took part in a match at Lord's in 1918 between Plum Warner's XI and the Public Schools. His Lordship, aged 67, scored 11 before being run out. With the war drawing to a close King George V watched England play the Dominions at Lord's in 1918. The Dominions opened their batting with South African Herbie Taylor and Australian Charlie Macartney. \\"Doing their bit\\" 210 first-class cricketers enlisted in the armed services, and others undertook war related work in support of the war effort. Taking Surrey as an example, Ernie Hayes, Bill Hitch and Andy Sandham joined the Sportsman's Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers while fast bowler Neville Knox became a private in the Public Schools Battalion. Herbert Strudwick, the Surrey wicket-keeper, worked in a South London munitions plant alongside team mate Razor Smith. Other cricketers helped in the recruitment drive, with Gilbert Jessop, promoted to the rank of Captain in the 14th Service Battalion, Manchester Regiment, making speeches encouraging men to join up. =John Philip Wilson= Jack Wilson played 9 matches for Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and a couple for HDG Leveson-Gower's XI in 1912 and 1913. He then turned his hand to flying, gaining his pilot's license on a Vickers biplane at Brooklands in June 1914. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Air Service when war broke out and flew missions throughout the war. In April 1915 he and another officer 'observed two submarines lying alongside the Mole at Zeebrugge' and 'attacked them, dropping four bombs, it was believed with successful results.' On 7 June the same year the Admiralty reported that 'this morning at 2.30 am, an attack was made on the airship shed at Evere, north of Brussels, by Flight-Lieutenants J. P. Wilson RN and J. S. Mills RN. Bombs were dropped and the shed was observed to be in flames. It is not known whether a zeppelin was inside, but the flames reached a great height, coming out from both three sides of the shed. Both pilots returned safely.' A few days later, on 21 June, the Admiralty announced that HM King had been graciously pleased to award the Distinguished Service Cross to both Wilson and Mills 'for their services on 7 June 1915, when after a long flight in darkness over hostile territory, they threw bombs on the zeppelin shed at Evere near Brussels, and destroyed a zeppelin which was inside. The two officers were exposed to heavy anti-aircraft fire during the attack' (London Gazette 21 June 1915). At the Yorkshire AGM in 1916, Lord Hawke said of Wilson, \\"May he continue his splendid work, and be with us when we again resume hostilities on the cricket field:\\" In the county yearbook for that year there is a photograph of him dressed in naval uniform. He was also awarded the Belgian Order of the Crown (LG 29 August 1917), and in the New Year's Honours for 1919 he was awarded the AFC, \\"in recognition of distinguished service\\" (LG 1 January 1919). In a conflict when the average survival time for R.F.C. pilots could be counted in hours, Wilson was promoted to Major, survived the war and died on 3 October 1959 in Tickton, Beverley, Yorkshire. His other claims to fame include winning the Grand National on 'Double Chance' in 1925. Cricket in war art Cricket was used as a theme in cartoons highlighting the \\"Hun's unsportsmanlike attitude to war\\". J.H. Dowd's The Kaiser's Cricket depicted a spike-helmeted German soldier playing cricket in a most underhand way. He is shown catching a ball in the field with a net, hitting an umpire with a bat, batting with a net in front of his stumps, pushing a batsman out of his crease before stumping him and bowling a ball from the middle of the pitch. C. M. Padday's painting of Royal Navy sailors playing cricket on deck \\"somewhere in the tropics\\" shows a ball made of twine attached to wickets made of buckets for easy retrieval when it was hit over the side. A Punch cartoon depicted the Germans in more lighthearted manner in a cartoon which showed a German plane flying over a cricket match. The game continues, even as the plane drops its bombs, with the fielders chasing a ball to the boundary. The caption, playing on the German misunderstanding of cricket, shows the German airman's report as saying \\"We dropped bombs on a British formation, causing the troops to disperse and run about in a panic stricken manner\\". The fear of poison gas attacks spreading to England saw the British Government warn citizens to take their gas masks everywhere in 1916, just in case. Essex cricketer and journalist Edward Sewell was photographed in full cricket gear wearing his mask. Grenades and bowling techniques British and Empire soldiers were instructed to throw the Mills bomb, a hand-held fragmentation grenade using a technique similar to that of bowling a cricket ball. Training classes were given on how to best do this. A cartoon satirising this was published by Geoffrey Stobie in 1918. The image has two panes; in the left pane, a cricketer is about to deliver the ball, his left arm out in front of him and his right vertically down behind his back holding the ball. In the right pane, this position is mirrored by a soldier, but rather than a cricket ball, he is holding a grenade in his right hand. The No. 15 Ball grenade was referred to as the 'cricket ball' grenade. It was ignited by striking the grenade like a match before throwing it at the enemy. It proved unreliable, as it was susceptible to the damp, and was withdrawn after the Battle of Loos. Deaths =Test cricketers= *Despite his epilepsy, Sergeant Colin Blythe joined the King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at the outbreak of war in 1914. He was fighting with the 12th (S) Battalion when he was killed by shell-fire on the railway between Pimmern and Forest Hall near Passchendaele on 8 November 1917, at the age of 38. The slow left armer had taken two and a half thousand wickets for his county and a hundred wickets in 19 Tests for England. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1904. He is buried at Oxford Road Cemetery in Belgium and his shrapnel punctured wallet rests in the pavilion at Kent's St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury. *Albert Tibby Cotter of the Australian 12th Light Horse was killed in action in October 1917 by Turkish fire. Before his last action, he tossed up a cricket ball of mud and said to a friend \\"That's my last bowl, blue. Something's going to happen.\\" He had been one of the great early fast bowlers of Test cricket, playing 21 games and taking 89 wickets, renowned for bowling an intimidating length at high pace. He hit an ageing W.G. Grace with a beamer the first time he faced him and refused to stop bowling at Grace's body, despite the great man's request, causing W.G. to walk off in disgust. To quote the account of the National Army Museum: \\"In April 1915 Cotter enlisted with the Australian Imperial Force. He joined the 1st Australian Light Horse Regiment, taking part in the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. Cotter later transferred to the 12th Australian Light Horse and was commended for his 'fine work under heavy fire' during the Second Battle of Gaza in 1917. On 31 October 1917 the 4th Light Horse Brigade, of which the 12th were part, captured Beersheba in a Brilliant cavalry charge. Trooper Cotter, serving as a stretcher-bearer, was shot dead by a sniper as the troops dismounted to engage the enemy.\\" He was buried in the Negev desert, 2 miles south of Beersheba. *Two of the famed South African 'googly quartet' fell in the fighting. Gordon White died of his wounds in Palestine in October 1916 at the age of 36. He had played 17 Tests for his country, scoring 2 centuries with a best of 147. Major Reggie Schwarz died in √âtaples, France on 18 November 1918, seven days after the Armistice. He had fought in German South-West Africa (now Namibia) been wounded twice in action and fell victim, at 43, to the influenza epidemic which swept through a war ravaged world. He was a major in the King's Royal Rifle Corps and had won the Military Cross. *Second Lieutenant Major Booth of the West Yorkshire Regiment was killed in action in July 1916 on the first day of the Somme Offensive, aged 29, when Britain lost 50,000 soldiers killed or wounded. Booth (his Christian name was Major) had been one of Yorkshire's leading all-rounders and had bowled unchanged with Alonzo Drake in consecutive matches in August 1914 as cricket drew to a close. He had taken 181 wickets in all first-class cricket in 1913 and 141 for Yorkshire in 1914. Booth was named a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914, the last season before hostilities. After joining up, he had been commissioned as a Second Lieutenant and first served in Egypt in 1915 before being assigned to the Western Front. He was killed near La Cigny on the Somme on 1 July 1916, while serving with the 15th (S) Battalion, The West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own), also known as 'The Leeds Pals'. He was buried at Serre Road Cemetery. *Reginald Hands died on the Western Front on 20 April 1918 in France. He had played his only Test for South Africa in 1914 against England at Port Elizabeth. He won a rugby Blue at Oxford University, as did his brothers. *Lieutenant Kenneth Hutchings of the King's Liverpool Regiment, attached to the Welsh Regiment, was killed in action by an exploding shell in September 1916. The Kent and England batsman had scored 21 first-class centuries, won 7 caps for his country, and been a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1907. Remembered as one of the most graceful batsmen of the Edwardian age, he helped Kent win the County Championship 3 times and scored 126 at Melbourne on England's 1907/08 Ashes tour. *Bill Lundie was killed on 12 September 1917 on the killing fields of Passchendaele in Belgium. He was a South African cricketer who had played in one Test in 1914 against England, at Port Elizabeth, when he bowled 46 overs into a strong wind, taking 4 for 106. *Second Lieutenant Leonard Moon died his wounds on 23 November 1916, near Karasouli in Salonica, Greece while fighting with the Devon Regiment. He scored 7 first-class hundreds while playing for Cambridge University from 1897 to 1900 and Middlesex from 1899 to 1909. He played four Tests for England against South Africa in 1905‚Äì06. *Private Claude Newberry died 1 August 1916 aged 27, and is buried at the Delville Wood Cemetery, Somme, France. He played four Tests for South Africa in 1913 and 1914. *Corporal Arthur Edward Ochse died 11 April 1918 aged 48, he was killed in action on the Western Front. He appeared in South Africa's debut Test match against England in 1889. =First-class cricketers= *Norman Callaway made his first-class debut at the age of 18 in February 1915 for New South Wales in Sydney against Queensland. Coming to the wicket with the score on 17 for 3, he reached his fifty in an hour and reached his century just half an hour later. He was finally dismissed the following day after for 207. First class cricket was then abandoned in Australia until the end of the war by which time Callaway had been killed in the Second Battle of Bullecourt in France in 1917. By dint of his only innings, he has the highest first class average on record. *Henry Keigwin was a batsman who scored heavily for Peterhouse College while at Cambridge and played 11 first class matches for Essex and others. He played for the Gentlemen against Surrey in W.G. Grace's last first class game in April 1906, scoring 77 and 27. He left England for Africa but returned at the outbreak of war to serve with the Lancashire Fusiliers and was killed in action on the Western Front. *Second Lieutenant William Burns of the Worcestershire Regiment was killed in action at Contalmaison in France in July 1916 aged 32. He had been a fine batsman in 217 matches for Worcestershire, scoring 196 in a stand of 393 with Ted Arnold at Edgbaston in 1909, and a ferocious fast bowler who took 214 wickets with a rather dubious action. *Percy Jeeves of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment was killed in action in July 1916. A Yorkshire man who bowled for Warwickshire and was tipped by Plum Warner for England honours, his name was taken by P. G. Wodehouse, a noted cricket fan, for his famous fictional manservant as a memorial to his loss. Wodehouse had seen the whippy medium pacer bowl just once, in a match against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham on 22 July 1913. *Lieutenant Harold Garnett of the South Wales Borderers was killed in action in December 1917, aged 38. He had been a brilliant left-handed batsman for Lancashire CCC, hitting 1,758 runs in 1901. He had toured Australia in 1901/2, left cricket to pursue business in Argentina, then returned to the game as a wicket-keeper. He played 152 first class games for Lancashire CCC and Argentina was among the first cricketers to volunteer in 1914. *Second Lieutenant William Odell, MC, of the Sherwood Foresters, was killed in action in October 1917 aged 31 at Passchendaele in Belgium . He had been a fine medium-pace bowler for Leicestershire and London County Cricket Club who twice took 8 wickets in an innings in his 193 first-class matches. *Cecil Abercrombie was killed on 31 May 1916 at the Battle of Jutland while serving on . A right-handed batsman and right arm medium pacer, he had played for Hampshire County Cricket Club in 1913. He averaged over 40 and scored 4 first class centuries in just 16 matches with a highest score of 165 against Essex. He also played for the Army and Navy in 1910 and the Royal Navy in 1912 and 1913. He was awarded his county cap and died at 30 years old. *Alfred Hartley R.G.A. was killed in action near Maissemy, France aged 39 in October 1918. He had been a useful batsman for Lancashire, scoring 234 against Somerset in 1910, his best season. He is one of the few county cricketers to have been born in the USA, in New Orleans. *New Zealander Rupert Hickmott, an opening batsman who played 17 matches for Canterbury and died aged 22 on the Somme in 1916 while fellow countryman George Wilson, a left-arm spinner for Canterbury who played just 6 matches and yet twice took 10 wickets in a match, died in Flanders on 14 December 1917 at the age of 28. *Cecil Banes-Walker, of the 2nd Devonshire Regiment who made five first-class appearances for Somerset was killed in action aged 26 between 6:45 and 7:30 on 9 May 1915 as his battalion advanced to provide support during the Battle of Aubers Ridge. *George Whitehead typifies the many young men who fell whose cricketing talent was lost before it could blossom. Captain of the Clifton College XI in 1913 and 1914 he had made 259 not out against Liverpool and was killed a month before the end of the war, serving with the Royal Flying Corps. *Frank Bingham played one match for Derbyshire in the 1896 season He was a doctor and an enthusiastic Territorial Army officer, and in the First World War served as a combatant rather than as a military doctor. He was a lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, King's Own Royal Regiment (Lancaster) and became a captain in 1914 and commanded a company. He took part in the Second Battle of Ypres and was killed on 22 May 1915 on a reconnaissance mission after stopping to dig a man out of a collapsed trench.Newspaper Obituaries of Frank Miller He is commemorated on the Menin Gate.Casualty details‚ÄîBingham, Frank Miller, Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Retrieved on 9 November 2009. *Charles Bassett Fleming played one match for Derbyshire in the 1907 season. He died at Gr√©villers, France on 22 September 1918. *Geoffrey Jackson played for Derbyshire from 1912 to 1914, and for Oxford University in 1914. He was given a commission in the Rifle Brigade on the outbreak of World War I and went to France in October 1914. He was invalided home, after the Second Battle of Ypres, suffering from gas poisoning and spent some months in England serving his Reserve Battalion. He returned to France, as Adjutant of the 1st Battalion, in December 1915, and was Mentioned in Despatches on 1 January 1916. He served continuously until his death on 9 April 1917 at the Battle of Arras. He was mortally wounded by a piece of shell after advancing about 6000 yards, and died at Faimpoux, Arras, Belgium before reaching the dressing station.Harrow School memorials *Charles Newcombe played one first-class cricket match for Derbyshire in the 1910 season, and also played league football for Chesterfield F. C. and Rotherham Town. He served in the First World War in the 7th Bn King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry as a lieutenant and was killed in action at Fleuraix in France on 27 December 1915. He was buried at Y Farm Military Cemetery, Bois-GrenierOld Cestrefeldians in the Great War *Edward Shaw played for Oxford University from 1912 to 1914. He served with the Oxford and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry as a temporary captain and was killed in action near Le Sars during the Battle of the Somme on 7 October 1916. *Guy Wilson played one first class match for Derbyshire in 1902 and one in 1905. He was killed in action during the Battle of Cambrai on 30 November 1917. =Additional losses= *A. E. J. Collins died at the age of 29 at the First Battle of Ypres on 11 November 1914. He is still famous for recording cricket's highest ever individual score, smashing 628 not out as a thirteen-year-old in a house match in June 1899 over the course of four afternoons. He joined the British Army in 1902 and studied at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich before becoming an officer in the 5th Field Company of the Royal Engineers. He had been Mentioned in Dispatches for action before his loss. His body was never found but his name is recorded at the Menin Gate Memorial in Belgium. His younger brother Herbert, a Lieutenant in the 24th Battalion of the Manchester Regiment and a fellow old Cliftonian. was also killed in action, on 11 February 1917, aged 27. Collins's wife, Ethel, lived as a widow for over fifty years. *George Marsden-Smedley, of the 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade, who had captained Harrow School's first XI in 1915, was killed in action on 18 August 1916. A memorial seat was placed overlooking the Harrow School Cricket ground, its inscription reading 'To love the game beyond the prize'. Casualties Other cricketers were seriously wounded in the fighting, which in many cases had a serious effect on their cricketing careers. *Harry Lee, the Middlesex batsman was reported killed in action in 1915, soon after enlisting, and a memorial service was held in his honour. He had been shot in the leg at the Battle of Aubers Ridge and lay for three days between the lines before being taken into German custody and repatriated as a hopeless case. His leg, although shortened and withered, recovered enough for him to make a century at Lancing in 1917. Unable to serve again in the forces he took a position in 1917 as cricket and football coach to the Maharajah of Cooch Behar and was booked to sail to India on the S.S. Nyanza. At the last moment his passage was switched to the Nagoya: the Nyanza was torpedoed just out of Plymouth. He went on to play 437 first-class games and a Test match for England, against South Africa at Johannesburg in February 1931. *Frank Chester, who later became a famous and highly respected umpire, was not so fortunate, having his playing career shattered when he lost his right arm below the elbow in fighting around Salonika in Greece in the summer of 1917 at the age of 21. He had been the youngest professional in the first class game when he joined Worcestershire in 1912 at the age of 16, scored 703 runs including 3 centuries and took 44 wickets with his off breaks in 1913 and scored 924 runs in 1914 with a best of 178 against Essex, hitting 4 sixes of England captain Johnny Douglas. As an umpire, he always counted the balls with six small pebbles picked up from his mother's garden at Bushey before he stood in his first match. *Jack Massie, son of Hugh Massie, had been a promising left arm fast bowler tipped for Test honours before the war, with Johnny Moyes considering him the finest of the type he had ever seen. He took 99 wickets in 16 first-class matches for New South Wales from 1910/11 to 1913/14 but was seriously injured in action. He was decorated for 'conspicuous ability, initiative, resourcefulness and devotion to duty. *Dudley Rippon was badly wounded during the Gallipoli Campaign and was discharged as a result. He returned to Somerset for the 1919 season, but only managed one match in the following summer of 1920 and, badly trouble by the effects of his wounds did not play any further cricket. A changed game The County Championship resumed in England in 1919, with the counties agreeing to a brief and unsuccessful experiment with two-day county matches. It was not only the playing ranks which had been thinned by four years of slaughter. Worcestershire County Cricket Club mounted a roll of honour, in the form of a wooden plaque, in the pavilion at New Road to list and remember the 17 members of the club who died in the Great War. It is still at the club.

Mascot is widely used by research facilities around the world. Mascot uses a probabilistic scoring algorithm for protein identification that was adapted from the MOWSE algorithm. Mascot is freely available to use on the website of Matrix Science.Mascot software, Matrix Science. A license is required for in-house use where more features can be incorporated. History means MOWSE was one of the first algorithms developed for protein identification using peptide mass fingerprinting. It was originally developed in 1993 as a collaboration between Darryl Pappin of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) and Alan Bleasby of the Science and Engineering Research Council (SERC). MOWSE stood apart from other protein identification algorithms in that it produced a probability-based score for identification. It was also the first to take into account the non-uniform distribution of peptide sizes, caused by the enzymatic digestion of a protein that is needed for mass spectrometry analysis. However, MOWSE was only applicable to peptide mass fingerprint searches and was dependent on pre-compiled databases which were inflexible with regard to post- translational modifications and enzymes other than trypsin. To overcome these limitations, to take advantage of multi-processor systems and to add non- enzymatic search functionality, development was begun again from scratch by David Perkins at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. The first versions were developed for Silicon Graphics Irix and Digital Unix systems. Eventually this software was named Mascot and to reach a wider audience, an external bioinformatics company named Matrix Science was created by David Creasy and John Cottrell to develop and distribute Mascot. Legacy software versions exist for Tru64, Irix, AIX, Solaris, Microsoft Windows NT4 and Microsoft Windows 2000. Mascot has been available as a free service on the Matrix Science website since 1999 and has been cited in scientific literature over 5,000 times. Matrix Science still continues to work on improving Mascot‚Äôs functionality. Applications Mascot identifies proteins by interpreting mass spectrometry data. The prevailing experimental method for protein identification is a bottom-up approach, where a protein sample is typically digested with Trypsin to form smaller peptides. While most proteins are too big, peptides usually fall within the limited mass range that a typical mass spectrometer can measure. Mass spectrometers measure the molecular weights of peptides in a sample. Mascot then compares these molecular weights against a database of known peptides. The program cleaves every protein in the specified search database in silico according to specific rules depending on the cleavage enzyme used for digestion and calculates the theoretical mass for each peptide. Mascot then computes a score based on the probability that the peptides from a sample match those in the selected protein database. The more peptides Mascot identifies from a particular protein, the higher the Mascot score for that protein. Features ;Peptide Mass Fingerprint search: Identifies proteins from an uploaded peak list using a technique known as peptide mass fingerprinting. ;Sequence query: Combines peptide mass data with amino acid sequence and composition information usually obtained from MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry data. Based on the peptide sequence tag approach. ;MS/MS Ion Search: Identify fragment ions from uninterpreted MS/MS data of one or more peptides. The software processes data from mass spectrometers of the following companies: * AB Sciex * Agilent Technologies * Bruker * Shimadzu Corp. * Thermo Fisher Scientific * Waters Corporation =Important parameters= *Modifications can be specified as fixed or variable.  Fixed modifications are applied universally to every amino acid residue of the specified type or to the N-terminus or C-terminus of the peptide. The mass for the modification is added to each of the respective residues.  When variable modifications are specified the program tries to match every different combination of amino acid residues with and without modification. This can increase the number of comparisons dramatically and lead to lower scores and longer search time. * By setting a taxonomy, a search can be restricted to certain species or groups of species. This will reduce search time and ensure that only relevant protein hits are included. Scoring Mascot‚Äôs fundamental approach to identifying peptides is to calculate the probability whether an observed match between experimental data and peptide sequences found in a reference database has occurred by chance. The match with the lowest probability of occurring by chance is returned as the most significant match. The significance of the match depends on the size of the database that is being queried. Mascot employs the widely used significance level of 0.05, meaning that in a single test the probability of observing an event at random is less than or equal to 1 in 20. In this light, a score of 10‚àí5 might seem very promising. However, if the database being searched contains 106 sequences several scores of this magnitude would be expected by chance alone because the algorithm carried out 106 individual comparisons. For a database of that size, by applying a Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons, the significance threshold drops to 5*10‚àí8. In addition to the calculated peptide scores, Mascot also estimates the False Discovery Rate (FDR) by searching against a decoy database. When performing a decoy search, Mascot generates a randomized sequence of the same length for every sequence in the target database. The decoy sequence is generated such that it has the same average amino acid composition as the target database. The FDR is estimated as the ratio of decoy database matches to target database matches. This relates to the standard formula FDR = FP / (FP + TP), where FP are false positives and TP are true positives. The decoy matches are certain to be spurious identifications, but we can't discriminate between true and false positives identified in the target database. FDR estimation was added in response to journals' guidelines on protein identification reports like the ones from Molecular and Cellular Proteomics. Mascot's FDR calculation incorporates ideas from different publications. Alternatives The most common alternative database search programs are listed in the Mass spectrometry software article. The performance of a variety of mass spectrometry software, including Mascot, can be observed in the 2011 iPRG study. Genome-based peptide fingerprint scanning is another method that compares the peptide fingerprints to the entire genome instead of only annotated genes.

David Young entered the school with his wife transporting a large gasoline-filled device that appeared to be a bomb. The couple corralled a large group of students and teachers into a single classroom. David attached the bomb trigger to his wrist and threatened the group that he might, at any time, move his arm and ignite the bomb. After a two-and-a-half hour standoff, the children were becoming restless, so the teachers preoccupied the kids in the form of movies, games, prayer, and books. David became increasingly agitated, and decided to leave the room. Before leaving the room, David attached the bomb's detonation device to his wife's wrist. When the children became increasingly loud, Doris Young began begging the teachers to settle the group down. At one point she lifted her arm sharply and the bomb went off prematurely, injuring Doris while David was out of the room. Returning to the scene, David shot his wife, then himself. All the hostages escaped, though 79 were later hospitalized with burns and injuries, the majority of which were severe.  Background  David Young was the only police officer in Cokeville for 6 months in 1979. After being fired for misconduct, he moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he married Doris Young. Both David and Doris had ties to white supremacist groups, including the Posse Comitatus and the Aryan Nations.https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/us/couple- in-school-blast-linked-to-extremist-group.html Prior to the hostage crisis, David had tested a similar bomb in a sealed school bus in Arizona, destroying it. David and Doris both returned to Cokeville on May 16, 1986. At 1:00 pm, they pulled up to the Cokeville Elementary School and unloaded a gasoline bomb, along with four rifles and nine handguns. Vengeance for having been fired did not seem to have been the motive, but rather a philosophy recorded in journal entries referring to a Brave New World where he wanted to reign over intelligent children. He had been aware of above-average achievement scores from Cokeville's education system. Journal entries also indicate that he saw opportunity in the close-knit community; he wrote, \\"Threaten one and all are at your mercy\\". David went to the school office, handing out a manifesto entitled \\"ZERO EQUALS INFINITY\\" and announcing \\"This is a revolution!\\". Teachers were confused and baffled by Young's nonsensical strange writing and deduced that Young and his wife were mentally ill and delusional. Meanwhile, Doris went from classroom to classroom, luring 136 children, 6 faculty, 9 teachers, and 3 other adults, including a job applicant and a UPS driver, into a first-grade classroom for a total of 154 hostages. She lured them by telling them there was either an emergency, a surprise, or an assembly there. Mr. Young had initially planned to involve longtime friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall, who had invested money with him in a get- rich scheme that he had called \\"The Biggie.\\" The two men eventually refused to participate in the event. Both men were handcuffed in a van outside the school. David's youngest daughter from his first marriage, Penny, entered the elementary school with David and Doris, but refused to carry out the plan, leaving to report the incident at the town hall. Penny, Deppe, and Mendenhall were never charged in relation to this crime because of their refusal to participate. = Bomb anatomy = The bomb was an improvised explosive device constructed in a small two-wheeled shopping cart with 2 baskets, one on top of the other. The top basket contained a gallon milk jug of gasoline, wired with a blasting cap. Below the jug in the bottom basket were 2 tuna fish cans filled with a mixture of aluminum powder and flour meant to aerosolize and deflagrate following detonation, each with their own blasting cap. Throughout both baskets were chain links, gunpowder, and boxes of ammunition acting as shrapnel. The mechanism was triggered by a dead man's switch, consisting of a wooden piece separating two metal connectors within the jaws of a clothespin, forming an incomplete circuit. The circuit was powered by a 9-volt lantern battery. Once the wooden piece was removed, the 2 metal connectors completed the circuit, detonating the bomb. The wooden piece was tied to Doris' wrist by a string. The jug of gasoline had a pinhole-sized leak on its bottom. This allowed gasoline to drip into the tuna fish cans, turning the aluminum-flour mixture into paste, unable to aerosolize. The leaking gasoline's fumes prompted teachers to open the classroom windows, unknowingly creating vents for the impending explosion. 2 of the 3 blasting caps on the bomb failed to detonate; the wires to each tuna can had been apparently cut. The blasting cap in the gasoline jug functioned properly, initiating the explosion. The reason for the wire cuts are so far unexplained.  Standoff  In the classroom, David held the gasoline bomb, with the triggering mechanism attached to a string tied around his wrist. He demanded a ransom of two million dollars per hostage ($308 million, $720 million adjusted for inflation), and an audience with President Reagan. David had also sent a copy of the manifesto to President Ronald Reagan. With permission, teachers brought in books, art supplies and a television to help keep the children occupied. Meanwhile, police and parents gathered out of sight of the school room where hostages were gathered. Doris tried numerous times to calm the children by telling them to \\"think of it as an adventure movie\\", or that they \\"would have a great story to tell their grandchildren\\". Many children showed signs of distress with sobs, complaining of headaches from the smell of gasoline from the bomb, or simply wanting to go home. One hostage observed a birthday on that day and songs were sung in his honor. The hostage takers took part in the singing. The mood did not lift with the singing and teachers quickly negotiated with the hostage takers to get items from the library to help the kids get their minds off the siege, and help to pass the time. Windows were opened to rid the room of gasoline fumes, and prayers were offered in small groups among the children. Throughout the standoff, David grew increasingly agitated and irritable. With fear that David might become unhinged, the teachers decided to make an ~8-foot square of masking tape for his own personal space.  Bombing and death of the perpetrators  About 2 1/2 hours into the standoff, David transferred the triggering mechanism of the bomb to Doris' wrist, and went to a small bathroom that connected the first and second grade rooms. Doris developed a headache from the gasoline fumes, and raised her hand to her forehead. This unintentionally activated the triggering mechanism and the bomb exploded, severely injuring Doris, and filling the room with black smoke and pockets of fire. Immediately following the detonation, the teachers started to shove children into the hallway, and through two open windows onto the grass outside the school, causing chaos as panicked parents tried to break through police lines. The subsequent police report states that David opened the door from the connecting bathroom, shot and killed his injured wife in the head, shot and wounded John Miller, a music teacher who was trying to flee, then closed the bathroom door and killed himself with a .45 pistol to the head. During the chaos, Doris' burnt body was expelled through a window, and left lying on the front lawn. When the bomb detonated, the majority of the explosive force was channeled through loose ceiling tiles into the roof, and open windows acting as vents. This significantly mitigated the explosive power of the bomb.  Aftermath, injuries and miraculous claims  79 of the hostages suffered injuries, mostly second-degree burns, smoke inhalation, and other injuries from the exploding bomb. The injured were triaged to several area hospitals in Wyoming and Idaho. Several children reported seeing angels in the classroom that day, including many children who claimed to have seen a \\"beautiful lady\\" or person all in white who told them to go near the window. Other children reported seeing an angel over each child's head.  Media  The incident was detailed in the book The Cokeville Miracle: When Angels Intervene by Hartt Wixom and his wife Judene, published by Cedar Fort, Inc., which formed the basis for a CBS made-for-TV movie titled To Save the Children. In 2006, the Cokeville Miracle Foundation compiled a book of recollections about the day from parents, emergency workers and former hostages. The story was also featured on Unsolved Mysteries, Unexplained Mysteries, and I Survived... A movie about the incident, The Cokeville Miracle, was released on June 5, 2015. It was made by filmmaker T. C. Christensen.

It was written by lead singer Steven Tyler and is five minutes and thirty-eight seconds in length. It was released in 1974 on the band's second album Get Your Wings. Song information According to Tyler, the song was inspired by the Massachusetts landscape in wintertime. The song's lyrics also discuss a relationship. It is one of Tyler's favorite Aerosmith songs. The song is highlighted by acoustic guitars, slow haunting vocals, and a strong rhythm. On the Get Your Wings album, the song starts off with a crowd of people cheering, which gradually fades to the howling wind and an acoustic guitar played by Tyler which start off the song. This is done to achieve a blending effect between this song and the previous track, \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\". Legacy While not released as a single, the song has gained prominence over the years. It was featured on the career-spanning compilation's Pandora's Box in 1991, O, Yeah! Ultimate Aerosmith Hits in 2002 and on the live album Rockin' the Joint in 2005. Additionally, the song has been resurrected as a live staple among Aerosmith shows in the 2000s, after not being played much on tours in the late 1980s and 1990s. However, the song was performed at the band's MTV Unplugged performance in 1990. On the Just Push Play Tour in 2001, Tyler and Joe Perry would start off the song at the top of a dual staircase. On the Route of All Evil Tour (2006) and World Tour (2007), Tyler and Joe Perry would start off the song sitting down on chairs at the end of the catwalk. The song has been covered by Die Kreuzen on the album Gone Away, Tesla on the Real to Reel 2 album and by Vitamin String Quartet on their Aerosmith tribute album. Boston pianist Yoko Miwa has recorded an instrumental jazz version with her trio, and Seattle's defunct Mother Love Bone (Pearl Jam's precursor) also recorded their version, which is available on scattered bootlegs. It can be found on YouTube as well.

While many studies have attempted to explain how the lek paradox fits into Darwinian theory, the paradox remains. Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic diversity in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists. This paradox can be somewhat alleviated by the occurrence of mutations introducing potential differences, as well as the possibility that traits of interest have more or less favorable recessive alleles. The basis of the lek paradox is continuous genetic variation in spite of strong female preference for certain traits. There are two conditions in which the lek paradox arises. The first is that males contribute only genes and the second is that female preference does not affect fecundity. Female choice should lead to directional runaway selection, resulting in a greater prevalence for the selected traits. Stronger selection should lead to impaired survival, as it decreases genetic variance and ensures that more offspring have similar traits. However, lekking species do not exhibit runaway selection. In a lekking reproductive system, what male sexual characteristics can signal to females is limited, as the males provide no resources to females or parental care to their offspring.Tomkins, Joseph L. \\"Genic capture and resolving the lek paradox\\" . Trends in Ecology & Evolution. Vol.19 No.6 June 2004. This implies that a female gains indirect benefits from her choice in the form of \\"good genes\\" for her offspring. Hypothetically, in choosing a male that excels at courtship displays, females gain genes for their offspring that increase their survival or reproductive fitness. Amotz Zahavi declared that male sexual characteristics only convey useful information to the females if these traits confer a handicap on the male. Otherwise, males could simply cheat: if the courtship displays have a neutral effect on survival, males could all perform equally and it would signify nothing to the females. But if the courtship display is somehow deleterious to the male‚Äôs survival‚Äîsuch as increased predator risk or time and energy expenditure‚Äîit becomes a test by which females can assess male quality. Under the handicap principle, males who excel at the courtship displays prove that they are of better quality and genotype, as they have already withstood the costs to having these traits. Resolutions have been formed to explain why strong female mate choice does not lead to runaway selection. The handicap principle describes how costly male ornaments provide females with information about the male‚Äôs inheritable fitness. The handicap principle may be a resolution to the lek paradox, for if females select for the condition of male ornaments, then their offspring have better fitness. One potential resolution to the lek paradox is Rowe and Houle's theory of condition-dependent expression of male sexually selected traits. Similar to the handicap principle, Rowe and Houle argue that sexually selected traits depend on physical condition. Condition, in turn, summarizes a large number of genetic loci, including those involved in metabolism, muscular mass, nutrition, etc. Rowe and Houle claim that condition dependence maintains genetic variation in the face of persistent female choice, as the male trait is correlated with abundant genetic variation in condition. This is the genic capture hypothesis, which describes how a significant amount of the genome is involved in shaping the traits that are sexually selected. There are two criteria in the genic capture hypothesis: the first is that sexually selected traits are dependent upon condition and the second is that general condition is attributable to high genetic variance. Genetic variation in condition- dependent traits may be further maintained through mutations and environmental effects. Genotypes may be more effective in developing condition dependent sexual characteristics in different environments, while mutations may be deleterious in one environment and advantageous in another. Thus genetic variance remains in populations through gene flow across environments or generation overlap. According to the genic capture hypothesis, female selection does not deplete the genetic variance, as sexual selection operates on condition dependence traits, thereby accumulating genetic variance within the selected for trait. Therefore, females are actually selecting for high genetic variance. In an alternate but non-exclusionary hypothesis, W. D. Hamilton and M. Zuk proposed that successful development of sexually selected traits signal resistance to parasites. Parasites can significantly stress their hosts so that they are unable to develop sexually selected traits as well as healthy males. According to this theory, a male who vigorously displays demonstrates that he has parasite-resistant genes to the females. In support of this theory, Hamilton and Zuk found that male sexual ornaments were significantly correlated with levels of incidence of six blood diseases in North American passerine bird species. The Hamilton and Zuk model addresses the lek paradox, arguing that the cycles of co-adaptation between host and parasite resist a stable equilibrium point. Hosts continue to evolve resistance to parasites and parasites continue to bypass resistant mechanisms, continuously generating genetic variation. The genic capture and parasite resistance hypotheses could logically co-occur in the same population. One resolution to the lek paradox involves female preferences and how preference alone does not cause a drastic enough directional selection to diminish the genetic variance in fitness. Another conclusion is that the preferred trait is not naturally selected for or against and the trait is maintained because it implies increased attractiveness to the male. Thus, there may be no paradox.

Retrieved on August 11, 2008. and the reasons for coming are also different. Currently, Jamaicans can be found in every major Canadian city and occupy a multitude of occupations. =Origins= The first Jamaicans who moved to Canada were West Indian slaves imported into New France and Nova Scotia individually and in small numbers. In 1796, the Maroons of Jamaica entered Halifax and were the first large group to enter British North America (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2000). The name Maroons was used to describe slaves who ran away from their owners and created free communities away from the European settlements in Jamaica. A war between the Maroons and the British broke out on the island of Jamaica in 1795. The war ended when the British, realizing that they could not win, tricked the Maroons into laying down their arms and then carried them into exile in Nova Scotia (James & Walker, 1984). Governor John Wentworth settled the Maroons who numbered over 500 on the outskirts of Halifax and offered the men jobs to fortify the Citadel. Standing proud and still holding on to the memory of being betrayed by the British, the Maroons mounted a strong resistance and refused to be compliant Nova Scotian settlers. After numerous appeals to London, the Maroons were allowed to return to Sierra Leone in West Africa in 1800. The \\"Maroon Bastion\\" stands on Citadel Hill as an example of their legacy and the sense of pride they contributed (James & Walker, 1984). Between 1800 and 1920, small numbers of West Indians were brought from Jamaica as labourers for the Cape Breton mines and from Barbados to work in coal mines in Sydney and Nova Scotia. Migration from the West Indies almost virtually stopped after 1920. As a result, the West Indian population in 1941 was smaller than it was 20 years earlier. Even though pressure for migration in the West Indies mounted, the Canadian government refused to allow any more non-whites into the country (James & Walker, 1984) (James & Walker, 1984). In 1908, Robert Borden, the leader of the Conservative Party, stated \\"The Conservative Party stands for a white Canada\\". Not to lose face with voters, the Liberal government passed immigration that excluded non- whites, except when they were needed for cheap labour (James & Walker, 1984). Agnes Macdonald, the second wife of the first Prime Minister of Canada, John A. Macdonald, was born in Jamaica. Her brother, Hewitt Bernard, was the recording secretary at the Charlottetown Conference in 1864. After Confederation, Bernard served as the private secretary to the Prime Minister between 1867 and 1873. Michael Manley, the future Prime Minister of Jamaica, served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. =After World War II= After World War II, a great demand for unskilled workers resulted in the National Act of 1948. This Act was designed to attract cheap labourers from British colonies. This resulted in many West Indians, (including Jamaicans) coming to Canada. The Jamaicans who entered Canada after World War II did so because they still believed it was an opportunity to escape poverty and seek a new start in a world where personal advancement and success seemed to be encouraged. Wanting to stop the in-flow of black West Indians, the Walter Act of 1952 was passed to impose a \\"severely restricted quota\\" on black West Indians entering the country (James & Walker, 1984). In 1955, Canada introduced the West Indian Domestic Scheme (Anderson, 1993). This Scheme allowed eligible black women who were between the age of 18 to 35, in good health, no family ties and a minimum of a grade eight education from mainly Jamaica and Barbados to enter Canada (James & Walker, 1984). After one year as a domestic servant, these women were given a landed immigrant status and were able to apply for citizenship after five years. Even though the Scheme originally allowed only 100 women per year, 2,690 women entered Canada from Jamaica and Barbados by 1965. In 1962, racial discrimination was taken out of the Canadian Immigration Act and the number of Jamaicans who moved to Canada dramatically increased (Lazar & Dauglas, 1992). =After the 1960s= Because changes in the Immigration Act allowed non-whites to enter Canada without restrictions, many Jamaicans took advantage of the opportunity and entered Canada with the hopes of achieving their goals for a better life. After the purging of many racist immigration policies, a large number of Jamaicans started to enter Canada as tourists and many would later apply independently for landed immigrant status (Anderson, 1993). In the late 1960s, the Canadian government instituted the Family Reunification clause into its immigration policy, which made it even easier for Jamaicans and other groups to bring their loved ones to join them in Canada (Anderson, 1993). Thus, during the 1970s and '80s, many Jamaicans who entered Canada were children and husbands of the Jamaican women who moved to Canada between 1955 and 1965. According to Anderson (1993), Caribbean immigrants to Canada were more likely to settle in large cities and their provinces of choice were Ontario and Quebec. The largest concentration of Jamaican immigrants can be found in the following areas of Greater Toronto: Scarborough, Old Toronto, North York, York, Ajax, Pickering, Mississauga and Brampton. Other cities include Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Kitchener, Waterloo, Windsor and Halifax (The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2000). In 1989, 86.7% of Jamaican immigrants settled in Ontario, 7.4% settled in Quebec, 2.6% settled in Alberta, 1.7% settled in Manitoba, 1.1% settled in British Columbia and 0.6% settled in the rest of Canada. Jamaicans made up 27.5% of the total number of West Indian immigrants for that year (Anderson, 1993). Because of language concerns, most of the West Indian immigrants settle in Ontario as opposed to Quebec. Demography Jamaica by far has been the major source of West Indian immigration to Canada since West Indians were allowed in Canada. Between 1974 and 1989, 35.7% of all West Indian immigration to Canada came from Jamaica. Nevertheless, there was a decline during the early '80s, a recovery during 1986 and a decline again by 1989 (Anderson, 1993). According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, Jamaicans made up 40% of West Indian immigration in the early 1990s. In a 1996 overview from Immigration Canada, Jamaica was ranked eighth in terms of the number of its citizens immigrating to Canada. Jamaica is preceded by countries such as China, Pakistan and the Philippines in the number of its citizens that migrate to Canada. The number of Jamaicans immigrating to Canada declined in 1997 and again in 1998. Jamaican immigration to Canada is at an all-time low; it was ranked number 10 by Immigration Canada in 2000.

According to the Minist√®re des Affaires Internationales, de L'Immigration et des Communaut√©s Culturelles et la Ville de Montr√©al, in 1995 there were 7,345 Jamaicans living in Quebec. By 2011, the Jamaican population nearly doubled to 12,730.NHS Profile, Quebec, 2011, Statistics Canada (2011). Retrieved on February 5, 2014. Between 1960 and 1970, 28% of immigrants in Quebec were Jamaicans, during 1971 to 1980 there was a sharp increase to 41%, there was a significant drop to 12% between 1981 and 1985 and between 1986 and 1991 the number went up to 20%. One possible reason for this drop between 1982 and 1985 might have been the language law Bill 101. Bill 101, which was introduced by Quebec's separatist government on August 26, 1977, introduced tighter restrictions on the use of English and access to English schools. It became against the law to produce any commercial sign that was not exclusively in French and the law aimed to make French the language of the workplace (O‚ÄôMalley & Bowman, 2001). Of the total number of Jamaicans living in Quebec, only 20% can speak French and 86% practice Christianity as their religion. One percent of the populations have no schooling, 13% have a primary education, 45% have high school education, 25% have a college education and 16% have a university education (Ministere des Affaires Internationales, de L‚ÄôImmigration et des Communautes Culturelle et la Ville de Montreal, 1995). =Population= According to the 2006 Census, 231,110 Canadians identified themselves as Jamaican Canadian. The actual number of Jamaican Canadians should be larger, given that many people identified themselves as \\"Black\\" \\"West Indian\\", or \\"Caribbean\\". In the 2011 Census, 256,915 Jamaican Canadians were counted, comprising an 11.2% increase since the previous census. A total population of 309,485 was tallied in the 2016 Census, an increase of 20.5%. Material culture Food: A spicy, colourful mix of cuisine includes ackee and saltfish, rice and peas, jerk chicken, fish and pork, curried goat, pepperpot soup, roasted yams, banana fritters, patties, salads, fruits and exotic desserts. Beverages include carrot juice, ginger beer, almost all kinds of fruit juices, coconut water and sorrel. Arts and crafts: Creations in straw, clay, fabric, shell, wood and semi-precious stone are on display in most Jamaican homes. African, Indian, European and Arawak cultures influence Jamaicans Arts and Crafts. Depicting life and landscape, Jamaican paintings feature bright colours and bold lines. No Jamaican kitchen is complete without a dutchy (a cast iron pot). Dutchys come in different sizes and it is said that, \\"the blacker the dutchy, the sweeter it cooks\\". Theater: From the 19th-century Ward Theater to innovative little theaters and thriving centers for drama in Kingston, Jamaicans like a broad range of theatrical treats. Plays depict a variety of Jamaican experiences. Sports and games: One could argue that the national game is domino followed by ludy. Sports of choice include cricket, football (soccer), bicycle racing, water-sports, horse racing, rafting, and track and field. Among youth however, basketball and hockey are the most popular sports; Jamaican Canadians Tristan Thompson and Anthony Bennett play in the NBA and represent Canada internationally in FIBA, while PK Subban is playing for the Nashville Predator and was selected to Canada's Winter Olympic Team.

Notable Grand Finals =1945: The Bloodbath= An infamous battle between Carlton and South Melbourne (now Sydney Swans), in which the game became footbrawl rather than football. It is the most bloodiest and toughest grand final of all time with the reporting and suspension of ten footballers from both teams. Fights went on all day with several players being knocked out, involving umpires, police, trainers, and spectators, all fighting on the field. Princes Park in Melbourne had 63,000 spectators screaming for blood. Carlton won by 28 points with the following ten players being reported: *Ted Whitfield (South), found guilty and suspended for the entire 1946 season. *Jack \\"Basher\\" Williams (South), found guilty and suspended for twelve weeks. *Captain Herbie Matthews (South), found guilty and severely reprimanded. * Keith Smith (South), found not guilty. * Don Grossman (South), found guilty and suspended for eight weeks. *Jim Cleary (South), found guilty and suspended for eight weeks. *Ken Hands (Carlton), found not guilty. *Captain Bob Chitty (Carlton), found guilty and suspended for eight weeks. *Ron Savage (Carlton), found guilty and suspended for eight weeks. *Fred Fitzgibbon (Carlton), an already suspended player, found guilty and suspended for a further four weeks for running onto the field and joining in numerous brawls. =1970: The Great Comeback= The most famous Grand Final of all time took place in 1970 before a record crowd of 121,000 people at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) who watched Carlton take on Collingwood. At half-time, the Blues were 44 points behind (nearly 8 goals) and the game seemed all but over, with a victory seeming a certainty for mighty Collingwood. At the half-time break, legendary Carlton coach Ron Barassi blasted his players with a frightening tirade of verbal abuse, pushing and motivating his team to concentrate on handpassing and short kicks - a strategy that worked wonders. In the second half of the game...the tide had turned...and the Blues came storming home. At the time-on stage in the last quarter with the final siren about to go off at any second, the Blues were still two points behind, then suddenly two quick goals - one from Crosswell and another from Alex Jesaulenko - saw Carlton in front by ten points. The clock was ticking...suddenly...the siren sounded...the game was over...Carlton...had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. There was nothing...absolutely nothing...but euphoria for the Carltonians...the MCG was shaking...the whole world and the skies were painted Navy Blue. During the game, the football world was inspired by one of the most famous marks in VFL/AFL history. Towards the end of the second quarter David McKay kicked it to the wing and Jesaulenko soared high into the sky on the shoulders of Collingwood's ruckman Graeme \\"Jerker\\" Jenkins, a giant of a man at 6'6\\", and took the heaven-high-grab with his hands out in front of his face. The commentator, Mike Williamson, spoke the infamous words \\"McKay, to the wing position on the member's stand side, OH JESAULENKO! YOU BEAUTY!\\" The mark symbolises Carlton famous victory over Collingwood in this Grand Final.Video of Jezza's Mark For 37 years this Grand Final victory stood as the greatest comeback in Carlton's history, until the 2007 season when the record was broken by an impressive win from 48 points down in the Round 3 clash against Essendon. It is fitting that Carlton's two greatest comeback wins are against its two fiercest rivals.

Content  Stirner begins by stressing the importance of education, saying that \\"the school question is a life question\\". He then sketches a brief history of education from the Reformation. For him, the Enlightenment introduced a new principle behind education to challenge the classical humanist principle. Where education had taught the few \\"to talk about everything\\", the Enlightenment saw the rise of the realist \\"demand for a practical finishing education\\". Stirner concludes: \\"Henceforth, knowledge was to be lived\\". Stirner saw educational theory in his day as a battlefield between the two parties‚Äîhumanists, grasping the past; and realists, seizing the present. He criticised both as seeking power over the \\"transitory\\" as viewing education as a \\"struggle towards mastery in the handling of material\\". Stirner supports the realist criticism that the humanists seek knowledge for its own sake, but asks whether the realists do any better. Because the realists merely supply the individual with the tools to achieve his will, without reforming that will, they fail to achieve what Stirner calls \\"freedom of will\\". They fail to reach self-understanding (a concept Stirner took from Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and twisted in his fashion in The Ego and its Own) and \\"fall in the abyss of their own emptiness\\". If the failures of the humanists and realists are truly to be overcome, \\"the final goal of education can no longer be knowledge\\". Asserting that \\"only the spirit which understands itself is eternal\\", Stirner calls for a shift in the principle of education from making us \\"masters of things\\" to making us \\"free natures\\". Until one knows oneself, one has not mastered one's own will, and one is merely subservient; once one masters it one is free. Stirner names his educational principle \\"personalist\\", explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education is to create \\"free men, sovereign characters\\", by which he means \\"eternal characters [...] who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment\\".

History  In 1971, the University of Michigan became the first university in the U.S. to create a campus LGBT center. The 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard sparked an increase in the number of university LGBT student centers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. For institutions like Syracuse University, a continued presence of hostile actions and climate spreading to campus has led to the creation of these centers. The movement has been slower outside of predominantly white institutions (PWIs); the first historically black college/university (HBCU) to open a center was Bowie State University in 2012. Despite the increasing support for these centers, it has been repeatedly noted that university administrators need to be made more aware of the issues facing LGBTQ+ students and the need for these centers on their campuses. Most LGBT student centers are concentrated where there is more support for LGBTQ+ students. As of March 2019, there are still eight states that have no institutions with an LGBT student center and nine that only have one institution with a center statewide. As of March 2015, more than half of post-secondary institutions in Canada have active LGBT student centers, with the oldest centre's establishment dating to before 1970. Several variables have been shown to impact the probability of a LGBT student center opening on a campus, including financial resources and the political environment.  Function  According to Sokolowski and the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals, \\"LGBT resource centers must also be staffed by at least one halftime (50% or 20 hours per week) professional staff person or graduate assistant whose job description is solely dedicated to serving the LGBT resource center and its services.\\"Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals. (2017). [Interactive Map of LGBTQ Campus Resource Centers May 8, 2017]. Find an LGBTQ Resource Center. Retrieved from http://www.lgbtcampus.org/find-a-lgbt-center. Depending on the campus, an LGBT Campus Center's mission may include faculty support, student advocacy, alumni relations, and/or public relations with the greater community (especially in response to crisis). Contrary to some beliefs and researcher opinions, LGBT student centers remain open to allies of the LGBTQ+ community and those questioning their identity. An LGBT Campus Center may provide academic resources related to LGBT Studies, support social opportunities for LGBT people to interact, and sponsor educational events for the campus as a whole. Most Campus Centers provide referrals to other campus departments or off- campus organizations to help meet student needs. Due to this increased support, many students view these centers more positively than the rest of their institution's campus and climate, creating a \\"microclimate\\" in the larger scheme of an institution's campus climate. Regardless of the concentration of on-campus support in these centers, the presence of these centers typically increases the available resources for students and increases perception from outside of the institution. Students who engage with centers are more likely to be out which allows them to further connect with these current students, but also puts additional pressure to help other LGBTQ+ students come out and grow relationships with them. Some LGBT Campus Centers provide psychological counseling for students struggling with their sexual or gender identity and for students coping with internal or external prejudice. Some example scenarios of when a student might seek out counseling from an LGBT Campus Center: * A questioning student seeks help understanding their sexual identity * A transgender student has just experienced a bias-motivated attack * A cisgender student is struggling to understand how to support their transgender roommate Some LGBT Campus Centers lack secure financial support that is sufficient enough to sustain their services, resulting in closures.  Criticism  = Positives of LGBT student centers = Since the more rapid rise of centers beginning in the late 1990s/early 2000s, there has additionally been an increasing need for these centers‚Äîparticularly as the proportion of openly LGBTQ+ in the United States has steadily increased. Awareness of centers and their resources on campus may be one of the most significant issues in regards to justification and expansion of existing centers. Additionally to further awareness, there have been calls to furthering numbers of resource centers across the United States due to roughly 10-15% of U.S. institutions of higher education having a center for LGBTQ+ students. On an international level, the Consortium of Higher Education LGBT Resource Professionals lists only three universities in Canada and one outside of North America that currently have resource centers for LGBTQ+ students. Centers are still frequently seen as a key way to foster relationships and networking among LGBTQ+ students, faculty, and staff, and are often marketed as such to bring a positive awareness. Post-secondary institutions who dedicate physical space in the form of LGBTQ+ student centers contribute to a positive climate for students who identify with the LGBTQ+ community. LGBTQ+ student centers act as a reminder to the LGBTQ+ community as a space known to be welcoming and accepting of all. Higher education professionals who are associated with LGBTQ+ student centres contribute to the development of an inviting and inclusive environment, also known as a \\"warm\\" campus climate. This creation of a \\"warm\\" climate allows for students to develop not only intellectually through High Impact Practices (HIPs) but holistically through mentorship and counselling support. This physical space has been noted as an effective way to incorporate the LGBTQ+ community in providing a safe space for students to find support while combating the adversities they experienced as students at their post-secondary institution. Through qualitative accounts from students discussing the importance of this space acting as their primary stop when looking for support, students stated that they knew they would find others and more importantly professional staff who would support them through navigating processes on campus and connecting them with other professional staff that would be supportive of them. LGBTQ+ student centers are key contributors in the development of inclusive environments for the LGBTQ+ community and link to academic persistence at post-secondary institutions. The Transformational Tapestry Model (TTM) focuses on the correlation between campus climate and student persistence investigated critical incidences, harassment bias, and interactions between individuals and groups where homophobia and heterosexism were at play and it was established that these experiences decreased campus engagement for LGBTQ+ students and resulted in more students withdrawing from their institutions. The need for inclusion on campuses is ensuring that students feel welcomed and accepted in their spaces. Inclusion at its core provides LGBTQ+ students the same engagement opportunities as their counterparts, and it provides the equity that students have been working in absence of when showcasing their true potential. = Negatives or Areas of Growth for LGBT student centers = Centers have been criticized for often being established, given full-time staff, or otherwise expanded in reactive (i.e., responding to an event or events on or off- campus). Additionally, many students may feel that even after the creation of a campus LGBT+ center, there may be an existing culture of hostility and homophobia and transphobia within the student body and university staff, faculty, and administration. Aside from combatting prejudices toward the LGBTQ+ community, there may need to be additional work done to combat other prejudices perpetuated by members of a campus LGBTQ+ community and their center's space, staff, and programming. A key critique of current outreach has been that existing centers may be unintentionally serving and targeting more privileged and \\"dominant\\" identity-holding members of a campus's LGBTQ+ community. For LGBTQ+ students of color, this may negatively impact them. The support needed to bolster higher administration to allocate the funds, staffing, and resources is often very hard to attain or takes years of momentum among predominantly undergraduate students. Due to centers primarily focusing on student outreach and assistance, some have criticized the undue burden put on students, particularly undergraduates, to bring action and successful programs and acclaim from both university administrators and outside organizations like Campus Pride. In regards to non-students, there has been additional criticism of existing centers and other university administrators for poor outreach to LGBTQ+ alumni and potential LGBTQ+ alumni donors.  Naming Centers  Many universities such as Bowling Green State University have expanded upon 'LGBT' to be more inclusive in their titles like 'LGBTQ+ Resource Center.' Students have been gradually preferring less binary labels for their personal identities as well as campus-affiliated resource centers.Rankin, S. R., Weber, G., Blumenfeld, W., & Frazer, S. (2010). State of higher education for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. Charlotte, NC: Campus Pride. While some universities like the University of Vermont and their Prism Center have expanded for the sake of inclusivity, other institutions like the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and their Pride Center may additionally have intentions to manage a lower profile, especially when it comes to state and federal funding.Gervin, C.W. (2016, Jun 26). UTK reinstates funding for LGBT center. Nashville Post. Retrieved from https://www.nashvillepost.com/politics/state-government/article/20865830/utk- reinstates-funding-for-lgbt-center Some LGBT labels have historically been more associated with either white or non-white cultures and have certain political connotations.Boykin, K.

D. Mills, 2003, A Dictionary of British Place-Names, Oxford University Press is a village located on the N67 route between Kilcolgan and Kinvara in south County Galway, in Ireland.  Location and name  Ballinderreen village is approximately 22 km south of Galway City and is a part of the townland of Ballinderreen. Ballinderreen is both the name of the Catholic diocesan parish of Galway and the townland where the village is situated. It takes its name from oak trees in the village. The Irish name of the village, Baile an Doir√≠n, means \\"town of the little derry or little oakwood\\", suggesting the area may once have been more heavily forested with oak trees. It contains the early Christian settlement of Surney of Drumacoo. The parish of Ballinderreen covers a larger area, taking in part of the village of Kilcolgan on the N18 and borders Clarinbridge, Kinvara and Ardrahan. Ballinderreen townland lies in the barony of Dunkellin (D√∫n Coill√≠n in Irish) and in the civil parish of Drumacoo (Droim Muc√∫).The Irish Placenames Commission (An Coimisi√∫n Logainmneacha) http://www.logainm.ie/ Amenities The village of Ballinderreen has a pub, a primary school,http://ballinderreenns.net a church (Roman Catholic, St. Colman's), a creche, several sports pitches (mainly used for hurling and athletics), a nursing home,https://web.archive.org/web/20070602065243/http://www.stcolumbasnursinghome.ie/ and a community centre. A small shopping centre including a fuel station, convenience store, hairdressers, and take away restaurant opened in 2009. Between 2000 and 2010 Ballinderreen saw the construction of new houses and several small residential developments. This has resulted in an increase in the village's population. Geography Ballinderreen is located close to Galway City, to the neighbouring villages of Clarinbridge and Kinvara, is located on the shores of Galway Bay (the village itself is approximately 1.5 km from the shore). Nearby locations within the bay include Brandy Harbour and Dunbulcaun Bay to the north and Kinvara Bay to the west. Aran Pier, Mulroog Pier and Tarrea Pier shelter some private pleasure crafts on these shores. Public transport to the village includes two to three services per day passing through the village. Bus √âireann and CityLink operate services frequently through Kilcolgan, five minutes away, to Galway, Limerick, Cork and Shannon Airport. The Ballinderreen area itself has sometimes referred to by locals as the \\"mini-Burren\\" due to its turlough and limestone pavement. A lake with extensive reed beds is present about 1 km west of the village. Education Residents of Ballinderreen typically send their children to the national schoolhttp://ballinderreenns.net in the village, which is one of the oldest national schools in the country, having been built in 1857. Other primary schools in the area include the Irish Language Gaelscoil de h√çde in nearby Oranmore and Educate Together in Kilcolgan.http://www.kilcolganetns.com/ Secondary schools in Kinvara (Seamount College)Seamount College and Gort (Gort Community School) cater for the older children.Gort Community School Music A community of local musicians and singers known as Ceolt√≥ir√≠ an Doir√≠n has formed a nonprofit organisation aimed at providing facilities for learning and playing traditional Irish music in Ballindereen. This group organise lessons and instrument rental to encourage traditional music and have recorded examples of local musicians and produced several musical events in the area. The tradition of Mummers is also alive in the Ballinderreen area with regular visits by Wrenboys () frequent on St. Stephen's Day (26 December) and Mummers calling door to door at Halloween. Sport Ballinderreen hurling club was founded in 1884, and has had relatively little success in terms of silverware at the older age level but did win the minor B in 1987. The club plays at the senior level. It won the Galway Intermediate hurling championship in 2017, beating Meelick Eyrecourt by 1-14 to 0-13 in the final.

It is abundant throughout Eastern Australia. Taxonomy The first Myrmecia gulosa specimen was collected in 1770 by Joseph Banks, making it one of the first Australian insects to be collected and described. Description As one of the largest of ant species, adult individuals have been observed to be as long as 15 mm to 30 mm in body length. The head and thorax are typically coloured red-brown; the rear half of the abdomen is black and the mandibles brown-yellow. Adults characteristically possess the long, powerful serrated mandibles and a venom- laced sting capable of causing severe pain for a couple of days. Unlike most other ant species, red bull ants lack the ability of chemical senses; however, this is compensated by their extremely keen vision, with which they can spot and respond to intruders two metres away. Distribution and habitat M. gulosa ants are abundant in eastern Australia. They can be found in the coastal regions of Queensland and east of New South Wales. Populations can be found Australian Capital Territory and in the Murray-Darling Basin. Colonies of M. gulosa ants have been recorded from Black Mountain, Brisbane, Fletcher, Stanthorpe and St. George in Queensland, and in New South Wales they have been recorded in Lismore, Armidale, Narrabri, Clarence River, Taree and in Sydney (in the suburbs of Como, Oatley and Liverpool). Their distribution in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia, Northern Territory and Western Australia has not yet been verified. Based on specimens collected, they are found living in elevations ranging from . M. gulosa ants generally construct small mounds, and they prefer open areas where they are frequently seen foraging. Foraging workers are frequently observed being around burnt areas. Behaviour Regarded as a relatively \\"primitive\\" ant species, red bull ants are known to be solitary predators that are occasionally uncooperative with one another, whose social behaviour is poorly developed in comparison to more \\"advanced\\" species. They are notoriously aggressive hunters able to subdue formidable prey such as bees and other ants. Unable to eat solid food, adult ants feed on juices from the prey insects; the meat of the prey is fed to the colony's larvae. Their diet is supplemented by the workers' own trophic (infertile) eggs, which are commonly fed to the queen and larvae. Nests are constructed with tunnel systems and may become quite extensive.

Higher Education in China. Beijing, PRC. China is also a major destination for international students, being the most popular country in Asia for international students, and the second most popular in the world. China is now the leading destination globally for Anglophone African students. In 2017, China surpassed the U.S. with the highest number of scientific publications. As of 2018, the country had the world's second-highest number of top universities in the Academic Ranking of World Universities's top 1000 universities, after the United States. In the 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking edition, China surpassed the U.S. with the number of universities including in the ranking for the first time (204 vs.198). China is home to the two best Asian universities with Tsinghua and Peking Universities, ranked at 20th and 23rd respectively in the world, according to the latest Times Higher Education World University Rankings. China has dominated the QS BRICS University Rankings and the THE's Emerging Economies University Rankings, claiming seven of the top 10 spots for both rankings. China is also the most-represented nation overall.  History  The traditional Chinese education system is based on legalist and Confucian ideals. The teaching of Confucius has shaped the overall Chinese mindset for the past 2500 years. But, other outside forces have played a large role in the nation's educational development. The First Opium War of 1840, for example, opened China to the rest of the world. As a result, Chinese intellectuals discovered the numerous western advances in science and technology. This new information greatly impacted the higher education system and curriculum. A number of institutions lay claim to being the first university in China. Peking University is the first formally established modern national university of China. It was founded as Imperial Peking University () in 1898 in Beijing as a replacement of the ancient Guozijian (), the national central institute of learning in China's traditional educational system. Meanwhile, Wuhan University also claimed that its predecessor Ziqiang Institute () was the first modern higher education institution in China. On November 29, 1893, Zhang Zhidong submitted his memorial to Guangxu Emperor to request for approval to set up an institution designed for training students specializing in foreign languages, mathematics, science and business. After Ziqiang was founded in Wuchang, not only courses in foreign languages was taught, courses in science (chemical and mining courses starting from 1896) and business (business course starting from the very beginning) were also developed at the school. Later, although the school officially changed its name to Foreign Languages Institute () in 1902, the school still offered courses in science and business. In China, there had been some earlier schools specializing in foreign languages learning, such as Schools of Combined Learning in Beijing (, founded in 1862In 1902, School of Combined Learning in Beijing was merged with Imperial Capital University, now Peking University. However, Peking University never claims 1862 as its year founded. Neither does Peking University claim the year of establishing the Guozijian, which can date back more than one thousand years. Hunan University, with a similar history with Peking, often traced its history back to a school established in 976 A.D, thus giving this university a thousand years of history. See .), in Shanghai (, founded in 1863), and in Guangzhou (), founded in 1864, but few provided courses in other fields, which hardly qualified as modern education institutions. Some argued that Wuhan University can only traced its history back to 1913, when the National Wuchang Higher Normal College () was established, but Wuhan University officially recognized its establishment as in 1893, relying on the abundance of historical documentation and the experts' endorsement. In 1895, Sheng Xuanhuai () submitted a memorial to Guangxu Emperor to request for approval to set up a modern higher education institution in Tianjin. After approval on October 2, 1895, Peiyang Western Study School () was founded by him and American educator Charles Daniel Tenney () and later developed to Peiyang University (). In 1896, Sheng Xuanhuai () delivered his new memorials to Guangxu Emperor to make suggestion that two official modern higher education institutions should be established in Beijing and Shanghai. In the same year, he founded Nanyang Public School () in Shanghai by an imperial edict issued by Guangxu Emperor. The institution initially included elementary school, secondary school, college, and a normal school. Later the institution changed its name to Jiao Tong University (also known as Chiao Tung University, ). In the 1930s, the university was well known in the world as the \\"Eastern MIT\\" due to its reputation of nurturing top engineers and scientists. In the 1950s, part of this university was moved to Xi'an, an ancient capital city in northwest China, and was established as Xi'an Jiaotong University; the part of the university remaining in Shanghai was renamed Shanghai Jiao Tong University. These two universities have developed independently since then. Tianjin University celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1995, followed by Jiao Tong University (both in Shanghai and Xi'an) in 1996. Other leading universities, such as Zhejiang University (1897), Peking University (1898), Nanjing University (1902), Central China Normal University (1903), Hunan University (1903), Fudan University (1905), Tongji University (1907) and Tsinghua University (1911) also recently celebrated their hundredth anniversaries, one after another. Soviet influence in the early 1950s brought all higher education under government leadership. Research was separated from teaching. The government also introduced a central plan for a nationally unified instruction system, i.e. texts, syllabi, etc. The impact of this shift can still be seen today. Chinese higher education continues its struggle with excessive departmentalisation, segmentation, and overspecialisation in particular. From 1967 to 1976, China‚Äôs Cultural Revolution took another toll on higher education, which was devastated more than any other sector of the country. The enrollment of postsecondary students can be used as example to illustrate the impacts. The number dropped from 674,400 to 47,800. This has had a major impact on education in the 21st century. The decline in educational quality was profound. In 1977, Deng Xiaoping made the decision of resuming the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gaokao), having profound impact on Chinese higher education in history. From the 1980s on, Chinese higher education has undergone a series of reforms that have slowly brought improvement. The government found that schools lacked the flexibility and autonomy to provide education according to the needs of the society. Structural reform of higher education consists of five parts: *reforms of education provision *management *investment *recruitment and job-placement *inner-institute management‚Äîthe most difficult. The reforms aim to provide higher education institutions more autonomy and the ability to better meet the needs of students. Instead of micromanagement, the state aims to provide general planning. The Provisional Regulations Concerning the Management of Institutions of Higher Learning, promulgated by the State Council in 1986, led to a number of changes in administration and adjusted educational opportunity, direction and content. Reform allowed universities and colleges to: * choose their own teaching plans and curricula * to accept projects from or cooperate with other socialist establishments for scientific research and technical development in setting up \\"combines\\" involving teaching, scientific research, and production * to suggest appointments and removals of vice presidents and other staff members; * to take charge of the distribution of capital construction investment and funds allocated by the state * to be responsible for the development of international exchanges by using their own funds. Reforms picked up the pace in 2000, with the state aiming to complete the reform of 200 universities operating under China's ministries and start 15 university-based scientific technology parks.China to Accelerate Higher Education Reform. People's Daily Online. 27 January 2000. Present day In 2002, there were slightly over 2000 higher education institutions in PRC. Close to 1400 were regular higher education institutions (HEIs). A little more than 600 were higher education institutions for adults. Combined enrollment in 2002 was 11,256,800. Of this close to 40 percent were new recruits. Total graduate student enrollment was 501,000. The number of graduates from Chinese higher educational institutions increased from 1 million per year in 2000 to 7 million per year in 2010.Caron, Christina. ‚ÄúChina and Canada: Economic Linkages, Migration, and the Canadian Labour Market.‚Äù Canada-China Human Capital Dialogue. Conference held at Ottawa, November 28, 2012. In 2005, there were about 4,000 Chinese institutions. Student enrollment increased to 15 million, with rapid growth that was expected to peak in 2008. However, the higher education system does not meet the needs of 85 percent of the college-age population.Porter, Susan. Higher Education in China: The Next Super Power is Coming of Age. American Council on Education. 2005. Since 1998, 10 universities have been targeted by the Chinese government to become ‚Äúworld-class‚Äù ‚Äî including Peking and Tsinghua universities. To achieve that goal, the government promised to increase the education allocation in the national budget by 1 percent a year for each of the five years following 1998. When CPC General secretary Chinese president Jiang Zemin attended the 100th anniversary ceremony at Peking University (Beida) in 1998 and the 90th anniversary ceremony at Tsinghua University in 2001, he emphasized this ambitious goal of advancing several of China's higher education institutions into the top tier of universities worldwide in the next several decades. In the meantime, China has received education aid from UNESCO and many other international organizations and sources, including the World Bank, which loaned China $14.7 billion for educational development. Since 2005, China has become the most popular country in Asia after overtaking Japan and the sixth largest country in the world in hosting international students. The top ten countries with students studying in China include South Korea, Japan, USA, Vietnam, Thailand, Russia, India, Indonesia, France and Pakistan. The number of international students studying in China often ranges around 200,000. Since 2015, China has become the third most popular destination country after only the UK and the US for overseas students. In spring 2007 China planned to conduct a national evaluation of its universities. The results of this evaluation would be used to support the next major planned policy initiative. The last substantial national evaluation of universities was in 1994. That evaluation resulted in the 'massification' of higher education with a renewed emphasis on elite institutions and education through initiatives like Project 985 in the late 1990s and the Thousand Talents Program which was launched in 2008. Since 2010, in some of the elite institutions, there has been an attempt at introducing some aspects of an American-style liberal arts curriculum for selected students.Karin Fischer, \\"cultural norms, Asia tries liberal arts\\" Chronicle of Higher Education February 5, 2012 According to data from 2015 of the People's Republic of China Ministry of Education, there were 2,845 Chinese National Higher Institutions, including 2,553 National General Colleges and Universities and 292 Adult Higher Institutions.\\"2015 National College List\\" People's Republic of China Ministry of Education May 21, 2015 The number of enrolled college students including undergraduate students, master and PhD students was 23.91 million in 2012.\\"2012 College Students statistics\\" People's Republic of China Ministry of Education May 01, 2013 From 2010 to 2015, the Chinese graduates continued to increase dramatically with almost 7.5 million new graduates entering the job market in 2015.\\"2015 Chinese College Graduates Employment Report\\" People's Republic of China Ministry of Education July 20, 2015 Investment in education accounted for about 4% of total GDP in China in 2015.\\"China Education\\" China Education Center Ltd The Chinese government has been more concerned about education, particularly higher education, in the last decades. International students have enrolled in over 775 higher education institutions in China. Until 2014, there were more than 377,000 foreign students from 203 countries or regions study in China.\\"2014 Statistics of Foreign Students in China \\" People's Republic of China Ministry of Education March 08, 2015 Although numbers of students have been increasing there are some serious concerns about the quality of education they are receiving and the skills they have at graduation. One study estimates that only 1.2 million of 15.7 million university graduates (or 7.6%) have skills that are valued by international markets for human capital. In other words, the vast majority of students educated in Chinese universities do not have adequate skills to compete in anything but the most local Chinese industries. Admission process A student's score in the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gaokao) is the primary consideration used for admission into universities in China. Regional education development imbalance leads to the different treatment of students from different regions. Enrollment rules in China are based on the scores on the Gaokao, but a given university's minimum score threshold varies depending on the province an applicant is from and the degree of competition in applicants from the province. The more you have more top universities in a region, the better chances its students will be enrolled into a top university. The university admission quotes are not based on the area's population but the university‚Äôs enrollment plan. In some populous provinces, the competition is extremely fierce, while, in some areas with more institutions, such as Beijing or Shanghai, access to a prestigious university is more attainable. Types of colleges and universities In China, according to ownership-based categories of HEIs, the higher education can be divided into two categories---State-owned or government-owned HEIs, including Regular HEIs, Independent Institutions, Higher Vocational Colleges, Adult HEIs, and non-government or private universities Due to the long-time influence by Soviet Union and late development of private universities, it has deeply rooted in Chinese heart that government-owned is much better than private ones. Regular HEIs is the cornerstone in China‚Äôs higher education, while private universities development could not be ignored. According to the latest data(2015) of People's Republic of China Ministry of Education, total number of Chinese National Higher Institutions is 2845, including 2,553 National General Colleges and Universities and 292 Adult Higher Institutions. Government-owned HEIs are likely to receive more policy and finance support from official level. Compared with state-owned universities, private universities‚Äô development is in an awkward position. Different with private universities in Western world, China‚Äôs private education is a complement to public universities to meet the needs for those who failed in their college entrance examination and who could not afford the tuition fees to study abroad. Due to the large population, Chinese public universities are impossible to satisfy everyone‚Äôs needs. Under this condition, private universities of China come into being. The advantages of their professional setting that more in line with market requirements could not make up for the lack of financial funds and students. Actually, these two factors are equal. The source of funds for them depends largely on students‚Äô tuition fees Except of competition from public universities and other sino-foreign cooperative private institution, the most deadly weakness is that Chinese officials deny acknowledging their degree. In Private Education Promotion Law of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, it clearly indicates that ‚ÄúPrivate university degree is that national recognition of the non national education series, belonging to private colleges awarded diplomas‚Äù. Though followed by ‚ÄúThe educated in Private colleges enjoy the same level and rights in further education, employment, social welfare, and participation in advanced selection with the educated public schools‚Äù , it can hardly compensate the flaw that the degree belonging to only private colleges awarded diplomas, but no acknowledgement by officials. = C9 League, \\"211\\" universities, \\"985\\" universities, and \\"Double First Class\\" universities = The C9 League (simplified Chinese: ‰πùÊ†°ËÅîÁõü; traditional Chinese: ‰πùÊ†°ËÅØÁõü) is an official alliance of nine elite and prestigious universities in mainland China, initiated by the Chinese Central Government through Project 985, a new project after Project 211, to promote the development and reputation of Higher education in China. Together they account for 3% of the country's researchers but receive 10% of national research expenditures. People's Daily, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, refers to the C9 League as China's Ivy League. This group of 9 elite universities includes Fudan University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Nanjing University, Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Tsinghua University, University of Science and Technology of China, Xi'an Jiaotong University, and Zhejiang University. Many other lists of elite Chinese universities exists. The C9 League dominates in terms of faculty recruitment, with disproportionate numbers of faculty who receive China's top two academic awards: the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Scholar award and the Thousand Talents Professorship. In 2015, a related initiative to promote the world class universities in China called the Double First Class University Plan was launched. = Rankings and Reputation = The quality of universities and higher education in China is internationally recognized as China has established educational cooperation and exchanges with 188 countries and regions and 46 major international organizations, and signed agreements with 54 countries such as the US, British, Germany, Australia and Canada on mutual recognition of higher education qualifications and academic degrees. The country has the world's second highest number of universities in the 2018/19 Academic Ranking of World Universities's top 500 universities and in the 2019/20 U.S News & World Report Best Global Universities Rankings. In 2017, China surpassed the U.S. with the highest number of scientific publications. In the 2020 CWTS Leiden Ranking edition, China surpassed the U.S. with the number of universities including in the ranking for the first time (204 vs.198). China has dominated the QS BRICS University Rankings and the THE's Emerging Economies University Rankings, claiming seven of the top 10 spots for both rankings. China is also the most-represented nation overall. On 18 September,2020, the members of a Chinese expert group, which was headed by Lin Huiqing, Chairman of the Medical Education Expert Committee of the Ministry of Education and former Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, unanimously agreed that Tsinghua University has been fully established as a world-class university. Challenges China exhibits a great need for better regulation as well as more academic qualifications, teaching experience, and understanding of social changes and technology. To achieve success, the state realizes that the impacts of the Cultural Revolution on education must be reversed. To this end, top universities now function as centers of excellence that serve as a model for all other institutes. A helpful model involved \\"twinning\\" of poorer institutes with model institutes to provide equipment, curricula, and faculty development. There is also an issue of funding and equity. Although academic praise reforms for moving the higher education sector from a unified, centralized and closed system to one that allows openness and diversification, they understand that decentralization and semi- privatization has led to further inequity in educational opportunity. Graduate unemployment rates are also a growing concern. Many corporations feel the quality of rote memorization instilled in Chinese students serves as a detriment to creative thinking and the lack of real-world experience during the formative years negatively impacts students' ability to adapt to the global business environment easily. These issues will need to be addressed in the coming years if China aims to continue its drive for excellence.Wach Out, India: China is way behind India in the business of outsourced services, but it has now started to catch up. The Economist. 4 May 2006. Unemployment rates are quite high among Chinese graduates. Because of expansion of universities in China last decades, more students had access to receive higher education. With continuous graduates‚Äô entry into employment market, graduate unemployment is highlighted. China‚Äôs recent upsurge in graduate unemployment has specific causes relating to economic development, education policy-making, and reforms in the economy as well as in higher education. As a result of the predicament of unemployment, educators, students, and the Ministry of Education is promoting training in skills for the market economy that would complement the more traditional classroom learning and the focus on \\"hard\\" credentials. In Chinese universities, students clubs and special training activities aim to cultivate \\"soft\\" skills in students, assisting in promoting resilient personalities and life skills as preparation for the uncertainties in the job market. International students With China‚Äôs rising national strength and popularity of Chinese in the world, China as a study destination attracts thousands of foreign students abroad and the number of foreign students continues to grow rapidly in recent years. According to 2014 data from Ministry of Education of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, there are more than 377,054 foreign students studies in all the 31 provinces in China, with an increase of 5.77% over the same period last year.\\"2014 Statistics of Foreign Students in China \\" People's Republic of China Ministry of Education March 08, 2015 In 2015, a record breaking 397,635 international students went to China, solidifying its position as the third most popular destination country after only the UK and the US for overseas students.\\"China's Rapid Rise As An Academic Destination\\" Student.com September 12, 2016 While US and the UK attracted nearly one-third of all globally mobile students, their leadership is under threat in the \\"Third Wave\\" of political turbulence and intense competition from English-medium Instruction or English-taught Programs in countries like China and Continental Europe. In 2018, according to the most recent statistics from the Ministry of Education of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, China (hosting 492,185 international students in 2018) has overtaken the UK (hosting 458,520 international students in 2018 according to Study in UK) to become the host of second largest international students population, after the USA. The largest source of foreign students comes from Asia, accounting almost 60% of the total, followed by Europe 18%, Africa 11% respectively. For individual country, the top three countries of origins are South Korea (62,923), United States (24,203) and Thailand (21,296). Only 10% of foreign students receive Chinese Government Scholarship and the rest 90% are self-funded. On the other side, more Chinese wealthy families are more likely to send their kids abroad to receive higher education. Free academic atmosphere, high-quality teaching and new way to cultivate talents---all these advantages contribute to the flood of Chinese students arriving in United States, United Kingdom, Germany and other developed countries. Chinese students have been the largest foreign group in USA since 2010, with 157,588 arriving between 2010 and 2011. The same situation happened in United Kingdom and Germany. Western education will likely remain the leading choice for Chinese students due to its cross-disciplinary fields and development of critical thinking.\\"90% Of China‚Äôs Super-Rich Want To Send Children Abroad\\" International Business Times April 7, 2012 China has a strong demand for postsecondary education, to the extent that its university system currently cannot keep pace with demand. Consequently, universities in the United States, Europe and Australia play a significant role by partnering with Chinese universities, aggressively recruiting Chinese students for study in their host countries, increasing the number of students they send to study in China, and adding to their presence on the mainland, either through official foreign campuses or extensions. Australia, United Kingdom, and other Asian countries are already making strides into this market. Partnering can be economically salubrious, either if the scholars choose to stay in the host country or return to the mainland. Most Chinese students who go abroad are among the best and brightest from their home country. Thus, if they choose to stay, they can benefit the economy of their host country when they gain employment and become members of their new communities. If they leave, they may maintain the contacts and connections they may have established, and also leave a positive impression on their hosts.Dynes, Robert. UC Foreign Graduate Students: Why A World-Class University Needs the World‚Äôs Best Minds. University of California Office of the President. 17 October 2005. Funding Compared with commonwealth countries‚Äô tuition, tuition of China‚Äôs higher education is relatively inexpensive. Nevertheless, the Chinese per capita income is much lower than western countries, so there are still some students from rural and mountainous areas facing funding problems. Chinese government has taken some measures to ensure the smooth enrollment of this group, like students loans, part-time jobs within campus, etc. It's seldom the case that college students discontinue their studies because of tuition or cost of living. Considering institution funding, it varies dramatically among different universities. In order to adapt to the fierce global competition in education, the Ministry of Education of the People‚Äôs Republic of China initiated Project 211 in the 1990s aimed at strengthening about 100 institutions of higher education and key disciplinary areas as a national priority for the 21st century.\\"Project 211 and 985\\" China Education Center Ltd On May 4, 1998, President Jiang Zemin declared that ‚ÄúChina must have a number of first-rate universities of international advanced level‚Äù, so Project 985 was launched. The total number of Project 985 is 39 and all of them belong to 211 project at the same time. The initial aim is to promote China‚Äôs educational competitiveness and establishment of a number of leading disciplines in the world. In September 2017, a related plan to promote the world class universities in China called the Double First Class University Plan was announced. Meanwhile, it is also the beginning to widen the gap and cause the imbalanced distribution of scientific research funds between 211 project universities and common public universities. Within the project, it is not only a glory but also hints numerous tangible benefits. The majority of public universities‚Äô development lies to all levels of government funds. Entry in this project means you will gain more research funds. According to another data from Ministry of Education of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, from 2009 to 2013, the total government research funding for 39 985-Project institutions is 13.9 billion RMB, with 73 211-Project Institutions approximately 5.1 billion RMB and rest of 670 common undergraduate colleges only 7.9 billion RMB. .

It is also known as the Tahiti lorikeet, violet lorikeet, Tahitian lory, blue lory, nunbird, and the indigo lory. It was formerly found on 23 islands around Tahiti, but now restricted to perhaps eight islands: Motu, Manuae, Tikehau, Rangiroa, Aratua, Kaukura, Apataki, Aitutaki, and possibly Harvey Island and Manihi. Its plumage is mainly dark blue and it has a white area over its upper chest, throat and face. The first captive breeding in the UK was by the Marquess of Tavistock in the 1930s. He was awarded a silver medal by the Foreign Bird League for this achievement. They are active birds, feeding on nectar, insects, and ground forage. Distribution and habitat Vini peruviana in Rangiroa The blue lorikeet was originally endemic to the islands of French Polynesia. It is also present in the Cook Islands, where it is one of a small number of landbirds on the island of Aitutaki. Dean Amadon, writing in 1942 after the Whitney South Seas Expedition, thought that it might have been introduced to the Cooks. David Steadman, who studied the extinct species of the areas, wrote in 1991 that it might have been but that he could find no evidence of this. Had it been native there it would have coexisted with Kuhl's lorikeet; today no Vini lorikeets are sympatric. He later concluded that it was probably introduced, as extensive excavations of fossils had found remains of Kuhl's lorikeet as well as two other species of extinct Vini lorikeet, but no fossils of the blue lorikeet.Steadman (2006) p. 218. The blue lorikeet will live in any wooded habitat within its range, including cultivated areas.Collar, N. & Kirwan, G.M. (2017). Blue Lorikeet (Vini peruviana).

Description The blue lorikeet is 18 cm long with a short rounded tail. Its plumage is mainly dark blue and it has a white area over its upper chest, throat and lower face. Erectile feathers on the top of its head show light blue streaks. Its beak is orange and its irises are yellow-brown. It has orange legs. Adult males and females have identical external appearance. The juvenile lacks the white plumage of the adult and has a dark grey-blue face and lower parts. The juvenile also has a black bill, dark brown irises, and its legs are orange brown.Forshaw (2006). plate 15. Blue plumage, which is shares with the related ultramarine lorikeet, is very unusual in the parrot order. Behaviour They roost in coconut palm trees, rising at dawn and calling and preening before feeding.Gerischer B & Walther B (2003) \\"Behavioural observations of the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana) on Rangiroa atoll, Tuamotu Archipelago, French Polynesia\\" Notornis 50(1): 54-58 They are usually found in small flocks of less than ten birds. They rest during the heat of the day in shade before resuming feeding in the afternoon. At dusk groups fly around calling until dark, when they retreat to spaces between palm leaves to roost for the night. =Diet and feeding= Blue lorikeets feed on the nectar and pollen of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera), Guettarda speciosa, Pemphis acidula, bay cedar (Suriana maritima), beach mulberry (Morinda citrifolia), Heliotropium foertherianum, Scaevola spp and Musa. On Rangiroa they fed mostly on coconut flowers during one three week study. They feed silently in small groups, and use their brush-like tongue to lap up nectar and pollen. Where flowers had not fully opened, they will use their bills to open them. After all the flowers on one tree have been fed at, they will move to the next tree, calling as they go. They also feed on insects among leaves and on the forest floor, and on leaf shoots and soft fruits. Status At Walsrode Bird Park, Germany They are endangered primarily by invasive species, including cats, rats, swamp harriers, and mosquitoes carrying avian malaria.

The role of the Indian agent in Canadian history has never been fully documented, and today the position no longer exists. The position of Indian agent was established in the early 1870s. Indian agents were responsible for implementing government policy on reserves, enforcing and administering the provisions of the Indian Act, and managing the day-today affairs of First Nations people. An Indian agent was the chief administrator for Indian affairs in their respective districts, although the title now is largely in disuse in preference to \\"government agent\\". The powers of the Indian agent held sway over the lives of all First Nations peoples in their jurisdictions. Both Indian Act and government agent duties were fused in the original colonial title of gold commissioner, which encompassed both agencies as well as the duties of magistrate, policeman, coroner and surveyor. Under the pass system in place from 1885 until World War II, a Status Indian was not allowed to leave his or her Indian reserve without a pass signed by the Indian agent and could be arrested if found off reserve without a pass or with a pass that had expired. https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/dark-history-canada-s-pass-system-1.3454022 Notable Indian agents in Canada included Henry Ross Halpin, Ebenezer McColl, and Alexander McKee. In 1969, First Nations peoples overwhelming rejected a government policy paper called the White Paper, which called for erasing the legal distinctions between First Nations people and others in Canada by repealing the Indian Act. First Nations people did not want to be assimilated, and they also disliked the paternalistic way they were being treated by the government. As a result, the government began to slowly change its approach, including by withdrawing all Indian agents from reserves. This title Indian agent was also used in the United States in the 19th and early 20th centuries for individuals authorized to interact with Native American tribes on behalf of the U.S. government; see Indian agent.

At the northernwestern end of the line of other glacial ponds and lakes near the \\"Devil's Bathtub\\", there is a sphagnum moss peat bog, where the build-up of moss has created a floating island in the middle of the lake. Due to the acidity buildup and lack of decay caused by the sphagnum moss, the bog is home to a number of carnivorous plants, including sundew and pitcher plants. Wildlife Mendon Ponds is known locally as a birdwatching destination. Birds present in the wetland areas include wood duck, red-winged blackbird, blue heron, Canada goose, Virginia rail, sora, least and American bittern, and American coot. Passerine birds of the park are typified by eastern bluebird, scarlet tanager, tyrant flycatchers, vireo, chickadees, and nuthatches. In winter, the park's chickadees take seed from patient visitors' hands. The park's Quaker Pond is home to a long-standing population of beavers.

The most common is from NTSC to PAL or the other way around. This is done so television programs in one nation may be viewed in a nation with a different standard. The video is fed through a video standards converter, which makes a copy in a different video system. Converting between different numbers of lines and different frame rates in video pictures is a complex technical problem. However, the international exchange of television programming makes standards conversion necessary and in many cases mandatory. History The first known case of television systems conversion was in Europe a few years after World War II, mainly with the RTF (France) and the BBC (UK) trying to exchange their 441 line and 405 line programming. The problem got worse with the introduction of PAL, SECAM (both 625 lines), and the French 819 line service. Until the 1980s, standards conversion was so difficult that 24 frame/s 16 mm or 35mm film was the preferred medium of programming interchange. Overview Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is the PAL to NTSC. * PAL is 625 lines at 50 fields/s * NTSC is 525 lines at 59.94 fields/s (60,000/1,001 fields/s) The two TV standards are for all practical purposes, temporally and spatially incompatible with each other. Aside from the line count being different, converting to a format that requires 60 fields every second from a format that has only 50 fields poses difficulty. Every second, an additional 10 fields must be generated‚Äîthe converter has to create new frames (from the existing input) in real time. Hidden signals: not always transferred TV contains many hidden signals. One signal type that is not transferred, except on some very expensive converters, is the closed captioning signal. Teletext signals do not need to be transferred, but the captioning data stream should be if it is technologically possible to do so. With HDTV broadcasting, this is less of an issue, for the most part meaning only passing the captioning datastream on to the new source material. However, DVB and ATSC have significantly different captioning datastream types. Role of information theory =Theory behind systems conversion= Information theory and the Nyquist‚ÄìShannon sampling theorem imply that conversion from one television standard to another will be easier if the conversion * is from a higher framerate to a lower framerate (NTSC to PAL or SECAM, for example) * is from a higher resolution to a lower resolution (HDTV to NTSC) * is from one progressive-scan source to another progressive-scan source (interlaced PAL and NTSC are temporally and spatially incompatible with each other) * has relatively little interframe motion, which reduces temporal or spatial judder * is from a source whose signal-to-noise ratio is not detrimentally high [low?] * is from a source that has no continuous (or periodic) signal defect that would inhibit translation. =Sampling systems and ratios= The subsampling in a video system is usually expressed as a three-part ratio. The three terms of the ratio are the number of brightness (\\"luminance\\", \\"luma\\", \\"Y\\") samples and the numbers of samples of the two color (\\"chroma\\") components (U/Cb then V/Cr) for each complete sample area. For quality comparison, only the ratio between those values is important, so 4:4:4 could easily be called 1:1:1; but traditionally the value for brightness is always 4, with the rest of the values scaled accordingly. File:Chroma subsampling ratios.png The sampling principles above apply to both digital and analog television. =Telecine judder= The \\"3:2 pulldown\\" conversion process for 24 frame/s film to television (telecine) creates a slight error in the video signal compared to the original film frames. This is one reason why motion in 24-fps films viewed on typical NTSC home equipment may not appear as smooth as when viewed in a cinema. The phenomenon is particularly apparent during slow, steady camera movements, which appear slightly jerky when telecined. This process is commonly called telecine judder. PAL material in which 2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:2:3 pulldown has been applied, suffers from a similar lack of smoothness, though this effect is not usually called telecine judder. Every 12th film frame is displayed for the duration of 3 PAL fields (60 milliseconds), whereas each of the 11 other frames is displayed for the duration of 2 PAL fields (40 milliseconds). This causes a slight \\"hiccup\\" in the video about twice a second. Television systems converters must avoid creating telecine judder effects during the conversion process. Avoiding this judder is economically importance, because much NTSC (60 Hz, technically 29.97 frame/s) resolution material that originates from film will have this problem when converted to PAL or SECAM (both 50 Hz, 25 frame/s). Historical standards conversion techniques =Orthicon to orthicon= This method was used by Ireland to convert 625 line service to 405 line service. It is perhaps the most basic television standard conversion technique. RT√â used this method during the latter years of its use of the 405 line system. A standards converter was used to provide the 405 line service, but according to more than one former RT√â engineering source the converter blew up and afterwards the 405 line service was provided by a 405 line camera pointing at a monitor. This is not the best conversion technique but it can work if one is going from a higher resolution to a lower one ‚Äì at the same frame rate. Slow phosphors are required on both orthicons. center The first video standards converters were analog. That is, a special professional video camera that used a video camera tube would be pointed at a cathode ray tube video monitor. Both the camera and the monitor could be switched to either NTSC or PAL, to convert both ways. Robert Bosch GmbH's Fernseh division made a large three rack analog video standards converter. These were the high-end converters of the 1960s and 1970s. Image Transform in Universal City, California, used the Fernseh converter and in the 1980s made their own custom digital converter. This was also a larger three-rack device. As digital memory size became larger in smaller packages, converters became the size of a microwave oven. Today one can buy a very small consumer converter for home use. =SSTV to PAL and NTSC= The Apollo moon missions (late 1960s, early 1970s) used slow-scan television (SSTV) as opposed to normal bandwidth television; this was mostly done to save battery power (and transmission bandwidth, since the SSTV video from the Apollo missions was multiplexed with all other voice and telemetry communications from the spacecraft). The camera used only 7 watts of power. SSTV was used to transmit images from inside Apollo 7, Apollo 8, and Apollo 9, as well as the Apollo 11 Lunar Module television from the Moon; see Apollo TV camera. * The SSTV system used in NASA's early Apollo missions transferred ten frames per second with a resolution of 320 frame lines using less bandwidth than a normal TV transmission. * The early SSTV systems used by NASA differ significantly from the SSTV systems currently in use by amateur radio enthusiasts today. * Standards conversion was necessary so that the missions could be seen by a worldwide audience in both PAL/SECAM (625 lines, 50 Hz) and NTSC (525 lines, 60 Hz) resolutions. Later Apollo missions featured color field sequential cameras that output 60-frame/s video. Each frame corresponded to one of the RGB primary colors. This method is compatible with black and white NTSC, but incompatible with color NTSC. In fact, even NTSC monochrome TV compatibility is marginal. A monochrome set could have reproduced the pictures, but the pictures would have flickered terribly. The camera color video ran at only 10 frame/s. Also, Doppler shift in the lunar signal would have caused pictures to tear and flip. For these reasons, the Apollo moon pictures required special conversion techniques. The conversion steps were completely electromechanical, and they took place in nearly real time. First, the downlink station corrected the pictures for Doppler shift. Next, in an analog disc recorder, the downlink station recorded and replayed every video field six times. On the six-track recorder, recording and playback took place simultaneously. After the recorder, analog video processors added the missing components of the NTSC color signal: These components included: * The 3.58-MHz color burst * The high-resolution monochrome signal * The sound * The I and Q color signals The conversion delay lasted only some 10 seconds. Then color moon pictures left the downlink station for world distribution. Standards conversion methods in common use =Nyquist subsampling= This conversion technique may become popular with manufacturers of HDTV --> NTSC and HDTV --> PAL converter boxes for the ongoing global conversion to HDTV. * Multiple Nyquist subsampling was used by the defunct MUSE HDTV system that was used in Japan. * MUSE chipsets that can be used for systems conversion do exist, or can be revised for the needs of HDTV --> Analog TV converter boxes. How it works In a typical image transmission setup, all stationary images are transmitted at full resolution. Moving pictures possess a lower resolution visually, based on complexity of interframe image content. When one uses Nyquist subsampling as a standards conversion technique, the horizontal and vertical resolution of the material are reduced ‚Äì this is an excellent method for converting HDTV to standard definition television, but it works very poorly in reverse. * As the horizontal and vertical content change from frame to frame, moving images will be blurred (in a manner similar to using 16 mm movie film for HDTV projection). * In fact, whole-camera pans would result in a loss of 50% of the horizontal resolution. The Nyquist subsampling method of systems conversion only works for HDTV to Standard Definition Television, so as a standards conversion technology it has a very limited use. Phase Correlation is usually preferred for HDTV to standard definition conversion. =Framerate conversion= There is a large difference in frame rate between film (24.0 frames per second) and NTSC (approximately 29.97 frames per second). Unlike the two other most common video formats, PAL and SECAM, this difference cannot be overcome by a simple speed-up, because the required 25% speed-up would be clearly noticeable. To convert 24 frame/s film to 29.97 frame/s (presented as 59.94 interlaced fields per second) NTSC, a process called \\"3:2 pulldown\\" is used, in which every other film frame is duplicated across an additional interlaced field to achieve a framerate of 23.976 (the audio is slowed imperceptibly from the 24 frame/s source to match). This produces irregularities in the sequence of images which some people can perceive as a stutter during slow and steady pans of the camera in the source material. See telecine for more details. For viewing native PAL or SECAM material (such as European television series and some European movies) on NTSC equipment, a standards conversion has to take place. There are basically two ways to accomplish this: *The framerate can be slowed from 25 to 23.976 frames per second (a slowdown of about 4%) to subsequently apply 3:2 pulldown. *Interpolation of the contents of adjacent frames in order to produce new intermediate frames; this introduces artifacts, and even the most modestly trained of eyes can quickly spot video that has been converted between formats. =Linear interpolation= When converting PAL (625 lines @ 25 frame/s) to NTSC (525 lines @ 30 frame/s), the converter must eliminate 100 lines per frame. The converter must also create five frames per second. To reduce the 625-line signal to 525, less expensive converters drop 100 lines. These converters maintain picture fidelity by evenly spacing removed lines. (For example, the system might discard every sixth line from each PAL field. After the 50th discard, this process would stop. By then the system would have passed the viewable area of the field. In the following field, the process would repeat, completing one frame.) To create the five additional frames, the converter repeats every fifth frame. If there is little inter-frame motion, this conversion algorithm is fast, inexpensive and effective. Many inexpensive consumer television system converters have employed this technique. Yet in practise, most video features significant inter-frame motion. To reduce conversion artefacts, more modern or expensive equipment may use sophisticated techniques.  Doubler  The most basic and literal way to double lines is to repeat each scanline, though the results of this are generally very crude. Linear interpolation use digital interpolation to recreate the missing lines in an interlaced signal, and the resulting quality depends on the technique used. Generally the bob version of linear deinterlacer will only interpolate within a single field, rather than merging information from adjacent fields, to preserve the smoothness of motion, resulting in a frame rate equal to the field rate (i.e. a 60i signal would be converted to 60p.) The former technique in moving areas and the latter in static areas, which improves overall sharpness. =Interfield interpolation= Interfield Interpolation is a technique in which new frames are created by blending adjacent frames, rather than repeating a single frame. This is more complex and computationally expensive than linear interpolation, because it requires the interpolator to have knowledge of the preceding and the following frames to produce an intermediate blended frame. Deinterlacing may also be required in order to produce images which can be interpolated smoothly. Interpolation can also be used to reduce the number of scanlines in the image by averaging the colour and intensity of pixels on neighbouring lines, a technique similar to Bilinear filtering, but applied to only one axis. There are simple 2-line and 4 line converters. The 2-line converter creates a new line by comparing two adjacent lines, whereas a 4-line model compares 4 lines to average the 5th. Interfield interpolation reduces judder, but at the expense of picture smearing. The greater the blending applied to smooth out the judder, the greater the smear caused by blending. =Adaptive motion interpolation= Some more advanced techniques measure the nature and degree of inter-frame motion in the source, and use adaptive algorithms to blend the image based on the results. Some such techniques are known as motion compensation algorithms, and are computationally much more expensive than the simpler techniques, thus requiring more powerful hardware to be effective in real-time conversion. Adaptive Motion algorithms capitalize on the way the human eye and brain process moving images ‚Äì in particular, detail is perceived less clearly on moving objects. Adaptive interpolation requires that the converter analyzes multiple successive fields and to detect the amount and type of motion of different areas of the picture. * Where little motion is detected, the converter can use linear interpolation. * When greater motion is detected, the converter can switch to an inter-field technique which sacrifices detail for smoother motion. Adaptive Motion Interpolation has many variations and is commonly found in midrange converters. The quality and cost is dependent upon the accuracy in analyzing the type and amount of motion, and the selection of the most appropriate algorithm for processing the type of motion. =Adaptive motion interpolation + block matching= Block matching involves dividing the image into mosaic blocks ‚Äì say perhaps for the sake of explanation, 8x8 pixels. The blocks are then stored in memory. The next field read out is also divided up into the same number and size of mosaic blocks. The converter's computer then goes to work and starts matching up blocks. The blocks that stayed in the same relative position (read: there was no motion in this part of the image) receive relatively little processing. * For each block that changed, the converter searches in every direction through its memory, looking for a match to find out where the \\"block\\" went (if there's motion, the block obviously had to have gone somewhere..). * The search starts at the immediate surrounding blocks (assuming little motion). * If a match isn't found, then it searches further and further out until it finds a match. * When the matching block is found, the converter then knows how far the block moved and in which direction. * This data is then stored as a motion vector for this block. * Since interframe motion is often predictable owing to Newton's laws of motion in the real world, the motion vector can then be used to calculate where the block will probably be in the next field. * The Newtonian method saves a lot of search and processing time. When panning from left to right is taking place (over say 10 fields) it is safe to assume that the 11th field will be similar or very close. * Block matching can be seen as the \\"cutting and pasting\\" of image blocks. The technique is highly effective but it does require a tremendous amount of computing power. Consider a block of only 8x8 pixels. For each block, the computer has 64 possible directions and 64 pixels to be matched to the block in the next field. Also consider that the greater the motion, the further out the search must be conducted. Just to find an adjacent block in the next field would entail making a search of 9 blocks. 2 blocks out would require a search and match of 25 blocks ‚Äì 3 blocks further distant and it grows to 49 etc. The type of motion can exponentially compound the compute power required. Consider a rotating object, where a simple straight line motion vector is of little help in predicting where the next block should match. It can quickly be seen that the more inter frame motion introduced, the much greater the processing power required. This is the general concept of block matching. Block match converters can vary widely in price and performance depending on the attention to detail and complexity. A weird artifact of block matching owes to the size of the block itself. If a moving object is smaller than the mosaic block, consider that it's the entire block that gets moved. In most cases, it's not an issue, but consider a thrown baseball. The ball itself has a high motion vector, but its background that makes up the rest of the block might not have any motion. The background gets transported in the moved block as well, based on the motion vector of the baseball, What you might see is the ball with a small amount of outfield or whatever, tagging along. As it's in motion, the block may be \\"soft\\" depending upon what additional techniques were used and barely noticeable unless you're looking for it. Block matching requires a staggering amount of processing horsepower, but today's microprocessors are making it a viable solution. =Phase correlation= Phase correlation is perhaps the most computationally complex of the general algorithms. Phase correlation's success lies in the fact that it is effective with coping with rapid motion and random motion. Phase correlation does not easily get confused by rotating or twirling objects that confuse most other kinds of systems converters. Phase correlation is elegant as well as technically and conceptually complex. Its successful operation is derived by performing a Fourier transform to each field of video. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm which deals with the transformation of discrete values (in this case image pixels). When applied to a sample of finite values, a fast Fourier transform expresses any changes (motion) in terms of frequency components. Since the result of the FFT represents only the inter-frame changes in terms of frequency distribution, there is far less data that has to be processed in order to calculate the motion vectors. DTV to analog converters for consumers A digital television adapter, (CECB), or digital-to-analog converter (box), is a device that receives, by means of an antenna, a digital television (DTV) transmission, and converts that signal into an analog television signal that can be received and displayed on an analog television. These boxes cheaply convert HDTV (16:9 at 720 or 1080) to (NTSC or PAL at 4:3). Very little is known about the specific conversion technologies used by these converter boxes in the PAL and NTSC zones. Downconversion is usually required, hence very little image quality loss is perceived by viewers at the recommended viewing distance with most TV sets. Offline conversion A lot of cross format television conversion is done offline. There are several DVD packages that offer offline PAL ‚Üî NTSC conversion ‚Äì including cross conversion (technically MPEG ‚Üî DTV) from the myriad of MPEG-based web video formats. Cross conversion can use any method commonly in use for TV system format conversion, but typically (in order to reduce complexity and memory use) it is left up to the codec to do the conversion. Most modern DVDs are converted from 525 <\\\\--> 625 lines in this way, as it is very economical for most programming that originates at EDTV resolution.

He served as Bishop (later Archbishop) of Miami from 1958 until his death in 1977. Biography Coleman Carroll was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the second of three children of William and B. Margaret (n√©e Hogan) Carroll. His parents were both born in Ireland, and his father, who worked as a railroad brakeman and clerk for Carnegie Steel Company, died in 1922. His two brothers also joined the priesthood; his older brother, Howard Joseph Carroll, served as Bishop of Altoona-Johnstown, and his younger brother, Walter Sharp Carroll, worked in the Vatican Secretariat of State. He attended Holy RosaryHoly Rosary elementary and high schools in Homewood, and later graduated from Duquesne University in 1926. His theological studies were made at St. Vincent Seminary in Latrobe. On June 15, 1930, Carroll was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Pittsburgh. He then served as a curate at the Church of the ResurrectionChurch of the Resurrection in Brookline, St. Scholastica ChurchSt. Scholastica Church in Aspinwall, St. Basil ChurchSt. Basil Church in Carrick, and Holy Cross Church on the South Side. In 1944, he earned a Doctor of Canon Law degree from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He organized St. Maurice Church in Forest Hills in 1949, serving as its founding pastor. He became pastor at Sacred Heart Church in East Liberty in 1951, and was named diocesan vicar for religious in 1952. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate in September 1952. He also headed the philosophy department at Duquesne University for four years, and taught at Mount Mercy College for ten years. On August 25, 1953, Carroll was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Pittsburgh and Titular Bishop of Pitanae by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following November 10 from Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, with Bishops John Francis Dearden and Michael Joseph Ready serving as co-consecrators, at the Cathedral of St. Paul. His consecration was attended by over 2,000 people, including Pennsylvania's first Catholic governor, David L. Lawrence. As an auxiliary bishop, Carroll assisted Bishop Dearden with the administrative duties of the diocese, and continued to serve as pastor of Sacred Heart Church. On August 13, 1958, Carroll was named the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Miami in Florida. His installation took place on the following October 7. At the time of his arrival, the diocese comprised sixteen counties in southern Florida with a Catholic population of 185,000. By the time of his death, the archdiocese was composed of eight counties, and included 700,000 Catholics, 127 parishes, 500 priests, and 750 nuns. A little over a year following his installation, Carroll founded St. John Vianney College Seminary in Miami. He later opened St. Vincent de Paul Seminary at Boynton Beach in 1963. He also established a weekly diocesan newspaper called The Voice. In response to the Cuban exile, Carroll welcomed over half a million Cuban refugees into the diocese. In 1960, he used the four-story school building of Gesu Church to establish the Centro Hispano Catolico, a welfare agency that provided medical care, child care, legal aid, employment service, food, clothing and cash for Cuban refugees in the diocese. He also helped to coordinate Operation Peter Pan, and even scolded Monsignor Bryan O. Walsh, who headed the diocesan Catholic Charities program, for not agreeing to resettle more unaccompanied children. However, Carroll was accused by some Hispanic Catholics, including a number of priests, of showing little interest in their community. They also claimed he was trying to Anglicize the diocese by limiting Spanish-language education in parochial schools and Spanish- language Masses. Carroll did, however, maintain amicable relationships with local African American and Jewish leaders. He was a frequent visitor of Camillus House, established homes for the elderly and unwed mothers, and opened rehabilitation centers for drug addicts and alcoholics. On August 5, 1968, Carroll offered the invocation at the opening of the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach.Official Report of the Proceedings of the Twenty-ninth Republican National Convention, published by the Republican National Committee (1968) Carroll was known for his firm control over his priests and parishioners, as well as for his outspoken conservative political views and progressive social outlook. He was a vocal opponent of a local ordinance in Dade County that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, supporting the Save Our Children campaign led by Anita Bryant. He was an advocate for racial justice and strongly supported the civil rights movement. On theological matters, he was described as a \\"hardline Roman Catholic traditionalist\\" known for his \\"vociferous opposition to liberalization of the church.\\" He also opposed repealing the practice of abstaining from meat on Fridays. When the Diocese of Miami was elevated to the rank of an archdiocese by Pope Paul VI on March 2, 1968, Carroll became its first Archbishop. The Dioceses of Orlando and of St. Petersburg were erected from the Archdiocese of Miami, with Carroll holding the status of a metropolitan bishop over them. Less than ten years later, Carroll took ill and Edward A. McCarthy was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Miami in 1976. At age 72, Carroll died from complications stemming from a vascular disease at his residence in Miami Beach. He was buried three days later in the priests' section of Our Lady of Mercy Cemetery in Miami. References External links *Archdiocese of Miami *Archbishop Coleman F.

Life  Gurzadyan was born in 1922 in Baghdad, to parents that survived the Armenian Genocide. Upon graduating from the Hydrotechnical and Constructional Department of Yerevan Polytechnic Institute in 1944, he became a graduate student of Victor Ambartsumian, who had just moved to Armenia. Being in Ambartsumian‚Äôs founding team of Byurakan Observatory, he later headed a Laboratory, in 1960s became deputy director of the Observatory for space research. Then, he headed the branch of Byurakan observatory on space research. In 1971 he founded and headed the Garni Space Astronomy Laboratory (Institute, 1992‚Äì2004). Member of Armenian National Academy of Sciences (1986; corresponding member 1965), DSci. 1955, PhD 1948. His son is Vahe Gurzadyan, mathematical physicist and a professor at Yerevan Physics Institute, whose main research topics are: the chaos in non-linear systems, N-body dynamics, stellar dynamics, Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, observational cosmology.  Works  In 1960s and early 1970s he directed the UV and X-ray observations of the Sun via Rocket Astrophysical Observatories K-2, K-3 and K-4 by means of ballistic rockets R-5; the first launch being on February 15, 1961 from Kapustin Yar military base in Russia. His paper in Comm. Armenian Acad. Sciences, XLIII, 28, 1966, ‚ÄúA Powerful X-ray Flare on the Sun‚Äù (of October 1, 1965) is on the detection of most powerful Solar X-ray flare observed by then. Then he moved to design space orbital observatories, both on board automatic probes and manned spacecraft. Ultraviolet telescope Procyon was on board Kosmos 309 in 1969, and X-ray telescope Altair on board Meteor 1-16 in 1974; both were launched from Plesetsk cosmodrome. Orion 1 Space Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories) the first space telescope with an objective prism, was installed in April 1971 onboard the first space station Salyut 1. The highlight was Orion 2 Space Observatory (see Orion 1 and Orion 2 Space Observatories), with a wide-angle meniscus telescope of the Cassegrain system, operated on board the spacecraft Soyuz 13 in December 1973. Spectra of thousands of stars to as faint as 13th magnitude were obtained , the first satellite UV spectrogram of a planetary nebula (IC 2149) was obtained, revealing lines of aluminum and titanium - elements not previously observed in planetary nebulae, two photon emission from nebulae was detected for the first time. For comparison, the Skylab‚Äôs UV telescope which was on the orbit at the same time, could only look at stars down to 7.5th magnitude. He predicted magnetic fields in planetary nebulae in 1960s, which were actually discovered in 2005 (Jordan, Werner, O‚ÄôToole). He authored theoretical papers on flare stars (predicted negative infrared flares), interstellar matter, binary stars. In 1990s he developed the theory of common chromospheres (roundchromes) of close binary stars and of evolution of binary globular clusters. For decades he lectured in Yerevan State University (theoretical astrophysics, celestial mechanics) and in Yerevan Polytechnic Institute (precise mechanics). He is also known as an original painter and for his essays on philosophy of science and art. Gurzadyan died on February 22, 2014 in Yerevan. His requiem service was attended by the President of Armenia and the service was held by Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of all Armenians.

The court had jurisdiction to deal with civil disputes where the amount in dispute was not more than ¬£50 sterling in the colony. The establishment of the court was the first practical civil court in the settlement. This was an important first step in improving the resolution of civil disputes in the settlement. The Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land eventually replaced it in 1823 when the court's charter was revoked by the Third Charter of Justice. Background The British government established the colony of New South Wales primarily as a penal colony with the intention of encouraging later settlement. Captain Arthur Phillip was appointed as the colony's first governor and did much to ensure the colony of New South Wales survived and transformed into a modern colonial outpost. Arthur Phillip Phillip's commission extended his authority from the top of Australia to the bottom of Tasmania plus islands to the east of New South Wales. Soon after the commencement of the New South Wales colony, Phillip was directed to commence a colony at Norfolk Island. Later, Governor Philip Gidley King was ordered to found a colony in Van Diemen's Land to prevent the French from laying claim to it. In 1803, King choose Lieutenant John Bowen, a British soldier to start the colony. Bowen chose Risdon Cove on the eastern shore of the River Derwent in the south-east for the first settlement of Europeans. In 1804 Lieutenant- governor David Collins moved the settlement across the river and Hobart was founded. The beginnings of the colony as a penal colony were hard. Food was in short supply and convicts had to be disciplined. Nevertheless, it soon prospered particularly with whaling and the release of convicts into the community who had served their time. With the increased prosperity came the need for better access to forms of civil justice. The British authorities foresaw the need for a civil judicial system to be established in the colony of New South Wales. A court styled the ‚ÄúCourt of Civil Jurisdiction‚Äù was established by the First Charter of Justice as well a Court of Vice-Admiralty pursuant to letters from the High Admiralty in Great Britain. This court was a failure for the settlement in Van Diemen's Land as the court would not sit outside Sydney. Litigants had to make an arduous journey to Sydney by boat to prosecute their case. The introduction of the Lieutenant Governor's Court was the first step in providing adequate access to justice in the settlement. Constitution The court was created by Letters Patent dated 4 February 1814 issued by King George III the reigning sovereign of England of the time. The court was styled the ‚ÄúLieutenant Governor‚Äôs Court‚Äù pursuant to the patent. It was composed of a deputy judge-advocate for Van Diemen's Land, who was commonly known as the ‚Äújudge-advocate‚Äù, and two other persons inhabiting the island appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land. The judge- advocate was the presiding officer. The lieutenant governor was not actually involved in the operation of the court nor did he preside as its head. The court could also sit with only two members, but in that case, one of those members had to be the judge advocate. The court had jurisdiction hear and determine summarily actions relating to land, houses, debt, contract, trespass, and just about any other common law or equitable case up to ¬£50 sterling. The cause of action had to arise in the island of Van Diemen's Land. The court was abolished in 1823 when it was replaced by the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land established by Letters Patents dated 13 October 1823. The letters were authorised by the British Parliament through the passing of the New South Wales Act 1823 (UK). The abolition was on the recommendation of Commissioner John Bigge who was appointed by the British authorities to inquire into the state of the New South Wales colony.J. M. Bennett, Bigge, John Thomas (1780 - 1843) , Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, 1966, pp 99-100 Sittings of the court Edward Abbott, the first ‚ÄúTasmanian‚Äù judge-advocate, arrived in Hobart in February 1815. His arrival meant that it was technically possible for the court to sit in early 1815. This was not to be, as his formal appointment had not arrived, so he could not be sworn into the office. In April, Lieutenant-Governor Thomas Davey proclaimed martial law which further delayed Abbott's swearing in. Abbott returned to Sydney to collect documents concerning his court. He returned to Hobart in November and in December opened the court for sitting. Governor of New South Wales, Lachlan Macquarie, did not think that Abbott was up to the task of running the court. However, Abbott proved to be the right man for the position at the time. Whilst he had a small knowledge of the law, he simplified procedure, reduced fees, and proceeded by common sense rather than legal niceties. Royal Commissioner Bigge contrasted the operation of this court with the Governors Court in Sydney and found that Abbott's court operated more efficiently and effectively than the Sydney-based court.A. Townsley, Abbott, Edward (1766 - 1832), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, Melbourne University Press, 1966, pp 2-3. Townsley Appeals There was no right of appeal from decisions of the court. This was in contrast to the situation with the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature where there was a right of appeal to the governor sitting as a court of appeal, with a possible further right of appeal to the Privy Council. The report by the Select Committee of the House of Commons recommended that it was inappropriate for an appeal to be available for the amounts of money involved in proceedings before these types of courts. In general, the court was expected to operate in the same manner as a Court of Requests. Problems with the court The court did not sit at Launceston, much to the displeasure of those residents and to the disapproval of Bigge. However, this was much preferable to not having a court at all, or having to travel to Sydney for determining a matter. Parties to disputes went to elaborate lengths to avoid taking claims over fifty pounds to the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature, which overwhelmingly sat at Sydney. One of the methods was to structure a debt so that it was composed of separate amounts of fifty pounds, so that each part of the debt could be sued for in the court in Hobart. This was an ongoing problem of concern. Between 1816 and 1819, there were 1560 cases lodged with the court. 1083 were heard and 477 were withdrawn. The increased commercial activity in the settlement made the fifty pound limit a barrier to trade. Bigge had to shame the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature to sit in Hobart in 1819, its first ever sitting there. Bigge was to subsequently recommend the establishment of the Supreme Court of Van Diemen's Land to remedy this situation. Compounding this problem was that up to 1821, no lawyers had arrived to practice in the settlement. Page 22 The court had to admit to practice people who had no legal training at all. This has led Alex Lowe to conclude that Van Diemen's Land \\"was essentially a realm of legal amateurism\\".Low, p21 Trivia The commonly accepted spelling for the settlement is \\"Van Diemen's Land\\". However, in the Second Charter, the settlement was spelt variously as \\"Van Diemans Land\\", \\"Van Dieman's Land\\", \\"Van Diemens Land\\" and of course \\"Van Diemen's Land\\".

It is a dynamic table that maps MAC addresses to ports. It is the essential mechanism that separates network switches from Ethernet hubs. Content-addressable memory (CAM) is typically used to efficiently implement the FIB, thus it is sometimes called a CAM table.  Applications at data link layer  At the data link layer, a FIB is most notably used to facilitate Ethernet bridging based on MAC addresses. Other data-link-layer technologies using FIBs include Frame Relay, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). = Bridging = The role of an Ethernet switch is to forward Ethernet frames from one port to another. The presence of a FIB is one attribute that separates a switch from a hub. Without a functional FIB, all frames received by a network switch would be echoed back out to all other ports, much like an Ethernet hub. In bridging packets between ports, a switch should only emit a frame on the port where the destination network device resides (unicast), unless the frame is for all nodes on the switch (broadcast), multiple nodes (multicast) or if the switch doesn't know where the destination device resides (unicast flood). Switches learn the port on which they first saw a particular source address and associate that port with that address. When the bridge subsequently receives a frame with a destination address in its FIB, it sends the frame out the port stored in the FIB entry. The FIB is a memory construct used by Ethernet switch to map a station's MAC address to the switch port the station is connected to. This allows switches to facilitate communications between connected stations at high speed. = Frame Relay = While the exact mechanics of a forwarding table is implementation-specific, the general model for Frame Relay is that switches have statically defined forwarding tables, one per interface. When a frame with a given data link connection identifier (DLCI) is received on one interface, the table associated with that interface gives the outgoing interface, and the new DLCI to insert into the frame's address field. = Asynchronous transfer mode = ATM switches have link-level forwarding tables much like those used in Frame Relay. Rather than a DLCI, however, interfaces have forwarding tables that specify the outgoing interface by virtual path identifier (VPI) and virtual circuit identifier (VCI). These tables may be configured statically, or they can be distributed by the Private Network-to-Network Interface (PNNI) protocol. When PNNI is in use, the ATM switches at the edges of the network map one of the standard ATM end-to-end identifiers, such as an NSAP address, to the next-hop VPI/VCI. = Multiprotocol label switching = MPLS has many similarities, at the forwarding level, to ATM. The label edge routers at the edges of an MPLS cloud map between the end-to-end identifier, such as an IP address, and a link-local label. At each MPLS hop, there is a forwarding table that tells the label switched router which outgoing interface is to receive the MPLS packet, and what label to use when sending the packet out that interface.  Applications at the network layer  Network layer addresses, such as IP addresses, are used on different types of media and can be handled similarly in all cases. =Forwarding= FIBs are optimized for fast lookup of destination addresses and can improve performance of forwarding compared to using the routing information base (RIB) directly. The RIB is optimized for efficient updating by routing protocols and other control plane methods, and contain the full set of routes learned by the router. Earlier implementations cached only a subset of the routes most frequently used in actual forwarding, and this worked reasonably well for enterprises where there is a meaningful most-frequently- used subset. Routers used for accessing the entire Internet, however, experienced severe performance degradation in refreshing routes cached in a small FIB, and various implementations moved to having FIBs in one-to-one correspondence with the RIB.Wire Speed Packet Classification Without TCAM: One More Register (And A Bit Of Logic) Is Enough Q. Dong et al., ACM SIGCOMM 2006 =Ingress filtering against denial of service = FIBs can also play a role in an Internet best current practice (BCP) of ingress filtering. Though the simplest form of ingress filtering is to use access-control lists to drop packets with improper source addresses, the use of access lists becomes difficult on routers with a large number of adjacent networks, and traditional access lists are not used in high-performance router forwarding paths. While the IETF document BCP 38 on ingress filtering does not specify a method of implementing source address filtering, some router vendors have implemented a mechanism which employs lookups in the router's tables to perform this check. (See also reverse path forwarding.) This is often implemented as a lookup in the FIB of the source address of the packet. If the interface has no route to the source address, the packet is assumed to be part of a denial of service attack, using a spoofed source address, and the router discards the packet. When the router is multihomed, ingress filtering becomes more complex. There are perfectly reasonable operational scenarios in which a packet could arrive on one interface, but that specific interface might not have a route to the source address. For the routers near the edge of the Internet, packet filters can provide a simpler and more effective solution than methods that employ routing information lookup, though this approach can be challenging when managing routers which are reconfigured often. Ingress filtering for multihomed routers will accept the packet if there is a route back to its source address from any interface on the router. For this type of filtering, the router may also maintain an adjacency table, also organized for fast lookup, that keeps track of the router interface addresses that are on all directly connected routers. = Quality of service = Differentiated services provides an additional method to select outgoing interfaces, based on a field that indicates the forwarding priority of the packet, as well as the preference of the packet to be dropped in the presence of congestion. Routers that support differentiated service not only have to look up the output interface for the destination address, but need to send the packet to the interface that best matches the differentiated services requirements. In other words, as well as matching the destination address, the FIB has to match differentiated services code points (DSCP).Definition of the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6 Headers, RFC 2474, K. Nichols et al., December 1998 = Access control and accounting = Specific router implementations may, when a destination address or other FIB criterion is matched, specify another action to be done before forwarding (e.g., accounting or encryption), or apply an access control list that may cause the packet to be dropped.  Attacks  CAM tables can be targeted for setting up a man-in- the-middle attack. A threat agent which has control of a device connected to an Ethernet switch can use MAC flooding to attack the switch's CAM table. If the table fills up, other traffic is treated as broadcast, unknown-unicast and multicast traffic and is forwarded to all ports making it available to the attacker.

Productions at TNC have won 43 Obie Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. TNC currently exists as a 4-theater complex in a space located at 155 1st Avenue, in Manhattan's East Village. History =1970s= Crystal Field and George Bartenieff founded Theater for the New City in 1971 with Theo Barnes and Lawrence Kornfeld, who was the Resident Director of Judson Poets Theatre, where the four had met. Feeling that Judson Poets Theatre had peaked,Interview with George Bartenieff, \\"The Long Run: A Performer's Life\\", New York Foundation for the Arts, summer 2003. they decided to form a theater of their own for poetic work that would also encompass a community ideal. The impulse to form a company coincided with the availability of a space at the Westbeth Artists Community in the West Village. Bartenieff, Field, Barnes and Kornfeld named their new company \\"Theater for the New City\\" after a speech in which then-Mayor John V. Lindsay envisioned a \\"new city\\" for all. The theater officially opened in March 1971. Its initial two seasons included plays by Richard Foreman, Charles Ludlam, Miguel Pi√±ero and Jean-Claude van Itallie. Theater for the New City also began its Annual Summer Street Theater, and founded the Village Halloween Parade with puppeteer Ralph Lee. The Parade won an Obie Award under TNC administration, but a desire to be much more commercially viable than TNC's anti-establishment spirit would allow caused Ralph Lee to form his own Parade Committee and split from TNC in 1973.Fields, Crystal, \\"Too Big For Your Britches\\". New York Theater Wire, undated. TNC subsequently inaugurated its Village Halloween Costume Ball, which it still holds to this day. TNC saw some major changes in its first year. Kornfeld and Barnes resigned, leaving Bartenieff as Executive Director and Field as Artistic Director. TNC also moved from Westbeth Artists Community and found a new home in the Jane West, a former seaman's hotel at 113 Jane Street, in a run-down area of the West Village by the Hudson River. Theater for the New City played a large part in rehabilitating the neighborhood, and the theater it created would later be known as the Jane Street Theater and house successes such as Hedwig and the Angry Inch. During its time at the Jane West, Theater for the New City cemented its reputation for being the most avant of avant- garde theater, offering radical political plays, experimental poetic works, dance theater, musical theater and even film. Mabou Mines found a home at Theater for the New City as did playwrights such as Romulus Linney, Harvey Fierstein, H. M. Koutoukas, Arthur Sainer and Maria Irene Fornes. A musical adaptation of Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry‚Äôs The Little Prince in 1973 featured a young Tim Robbins in the title role. The 1976 play Dinosaur Door by Barbara Garson featured a young Vin Diesel. In 1977, the theater moved from the West Village to the East Village, converting a former Tabernacle Baptist church at 156 2nd Avenue, near East 10th Street, into a cultural complex with a rehearsal room and three theaters named after Joe Cino, Charles Stanley and James Waring. Notable productions in the late 1970s and 1980s include the American premiere of two of Heiner Muller‚Äôs plays, Hamletmachine Gussow, Mel, \\"Hamletmachine in American Premiere\\", New York Times, December 22, 1984. in 1984 and Quartett Gussow, Mel, Heiner Muller's 'Quartet'\\", New York Times, December 24, 1985. in 1985; and Buried Child Eder, Richard, \\"Buried Child\\", New York Times, November 7, 1978. by Sam Shepard in 1978. The Theater for the New City production of Buried Child moved Off-Broadway to the Theatre de Lys and in 1979, and became the first Off-Off-Broadway play to win the Pulitzer Prize. =1980s-1990s= Rent in New York City began to increase exponentially in the early 1980s Freedman, Samuel G, \\"For Arts Groups in Manhattan, The Lease is the Thing\\", New York Times, December 22, 1985 and Theater for the New City was forced to find another home in 1984 after its rent increased 300%.Freedman, Samuel G, Theater Seeking New Home\\", New York Times, November 26, 1984 With the help of Bess Myerson, Ruth Messinger and David Dinkins, the theater was able to purchase an underutilized former WPA building one block east at 155 First Avenue in 1986. The first Halloween Ball to take place in the new location was held in tents pitched on 10th Street because a Certificate of Occupancy hadn't yet been obtained. Refusing to close doors during renovation, TNC threw up two interim theater spaces, which like its predecessors in the 2nd Avenue building, were named after Off-Off Broadway founders Joe Cino and Charles Stanley. The first completed theater was created with the help of sculptor John Seward Johnson II of the Johnson & Johnson family and his wife Joyce. In honor of its benefactors, it was named the Joyce and Seward Johnson Theater. It is currently one of the largest theaters Off- Off-Broadway. Renovation of the building was finally completed in 2001. Responding to the homeless problem of the late 1980s and government cutbacks in the arts, TNC created an after school Arts-in-Education program for shelter children in 1990. Budget cuts also forced the theater to reluctantly raise its admission prices from $4 to $5‚Äì$7 in 1993 ($7 was then the price of a movie ticket) and then to $10 in 1994. The current cap on ticket prices is $20. Other major changes in this period include the resignation of George Bartenieff in 1992. Crystal Field remains as Executive Artistic Director. =Current status and events= TNC continues to produce 30-40 new plays per year, along with its Annual Summer Street Theater, the Annual Village Halloween Costume Ball and the Lower East Side Festival of the Arts, which was created in 1996 to celebrate the ethnic and artistic diversity of TNC's Lower East Side neighborhood. From 2006 to 2008, TNC presented the NY Uke Fest, a 4 night, 3 day celebration of ukulele music, under the direction of Uke Jackson and the New York Ukulele Ensemble. Many first generation Off-Off-Broadway playwrights continue to present their work at TNC, among them Charles Busch (who premiered his plays Shanghai Moon at TNC in 1999, The Divine Sister in 2010, and Judith of Bethulia in 2012), Jean-Claude van Itallie and Tom O'Horgan. More recent TNC alumni include Tony Award-winning director Moises Kaufman, who directed his first American plays at TNC after emigrating from his native Argentina, and Nobel Prize winner Gao Xinjian, whose first play in America was staged at TNC in 1997. Other notable playwrights to have their work presented at TNC include Bina Sharif, Barbara Kahn, Laurence Holder, Raymond J. Barry, Trav S.D. and Matt Morillo. TNC continues to be a haven for Emerging playwrights, and in 2006, a play reading series, New City, New Blood, was created in order to further showcase new works. In addition to their Community Festivals, several outside groups are presented at TNC. Annually, the Bread & Puppet Theater and the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers are presented by TNC, and each December, noted Playwright and TNC Alum Charles Busch holds a staged reading of his play Times Square Angel. In 2004, TNC began holding an annual Valentine's Day Benefit. The Love N' Courage Benefit is held on a Monday night, near Valentine's Day. Beginning in 2007, this benefit is held at The National Arts Club. The event, presented in a pageant style, is meant as a fundraiser for TNC, and has honored friends of TNC, patrons of the arts, and, in 2006, the City of New Orleans. TNC donated a portion of the proceeds raised from this Benefit to Southern Rep, a theater company in New Orleans whose space was destroyed in the floods resulting from Hurricane Katrina. This event often features a star-studded lineup of performers; it has been hosted by Charles Busch and Julie Halston, and performers have included Kitty Carlisle Hart, Elaine Stritch, Patricia Neal, Tammy Grimes, F. Murray Abraham, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson. The 2008 benefit honored playwright Edward Albee and included performances by Elaine Stritch, Marian Seldes, Basil Twist and Bill Irwin. The 2009 benefit honored Elaine Stritch and in 2010, Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson were honored. In 2012, TNC honored the 100th birthday of Bel Kaufman. The benefit in 2013 will honor Charles Busch. TNC is featured in the 2007 Academy Award-nominated film The Savages. TNC announced in January 2013 that the mortgage on their space at 155 1st Avenue, which had begun in 1987 at $717,000, had been retired, 5 years ahead of schedule, thanks to a two-year \\"Burn The Mortgage\\" campaign that included widespread support from individual donors and independent foundations. This ensures TNC will remain a permanent fixture on the landscape of Theater in New York City. Programs Through its Resident Theater Program, TNC produces 20-30 new American plays per year, providing a forum for both new and mid-career writers to experiment with their work and develop as artists. For newer writers, TNC offers an Emerging Theater Program that commissions and produces 10 plays by fledgling writers each year. The newest division of the Resident Theater Program, New City, New Blood, is a reading series for worthy plays in earlier stages of development. Scratch Night at TNC (works-in-progress) is a new program that invites artists to try out their ideas in front of an audience at any stage of development. The Annual Summer Street Theater Tour is a free operetta-for-the-streets that tours 13 locations in all 5 boroughs of New York City. Begun in the early 1970s and embodying the grassroots ideals of that decade, Street Theater aims to raise social awareness in the communities it performs in, creating civic dialogue that inspires a better understanding of the world beyond the communities' geographic boundaries. Written and Directed by Crystal Field, TNC's Street Theater features a company of 50 and performs on Weekends in Parks, Playgrounds, Closed-off streets and the like. The Presenting Theater Program is TNC's vehicle to providing a showcase for performing groups without a permanent base. Each winter, the Presenting Program hosts Bread & Puppet Theater, the oldest continuing experimental theater company in America and the Thunderbird American Indian Dance Concert and pow-wow, which offers ritual and social dances from 17 tribes throughout the United States. TNC's Arts in Education program was developed specifically to foster communication and self- esteem in at-risk and limited English proficient students. It has served P.S. 20, JHS 64, the Regents Family Shelter and the Catherine Street Shelter, and currently consists of a free After School Theater Workshop for low-income Lower East Side children. The Community Festival Program consists of two free annual events, the Village Halloween Costume Ball and the Lower East Side Festival of the Arts. The Halloween Ball showcases over 450 artists and performers at a multi-level theatrical event, with performances that spill out onto the street. The Lower East Side Festival of the Arts is a free three-day weekend long extravaganza celebrating the cultural and artistic diversity of the Lower East Side. This event has grown tenfold since its inception in 1996, and is currently attended by over 3,000 people annually. TNC's Art Gallery grew out of the annual art exhibit for the Lower East Side Festival of the Arts, and is now a year-round program of curated shows. Theater for the New City's annual summer performance festival known as Dream Up Festival started in 2010. The festival is dedicated to new works and performances run in August and September. Theater for the New City is looking for the best writing and or most original concepts to present to New York City. Facility TNC's permanent home is the former First Avenue Retail Market created in 1938 by Fiorello LaGuardia to take pushcart peddlers off the streets. TNC purchased the building in 1986, but to its later regret, was not able to purchase the air rights above the one-story facility. After moving into the space in September 1986. it created two interim theaters to continue production while raising the $2 million needed for renovation funds. The building currently consists of four theaters: =Seward and Joyce Johnson Theater= The Seward and Joyce Johnson Theater was the first theater to finish renovation in 1991. Funding for the theater was provided by sculptor John Seward Johnson II of the Johnson and Johnson family, and his wife Joyce. Johnson designed and created the silver archway into the theater. One of the largest theaters Off-Off- Broadway, and the only space that can be used as a 99-seat Off-Off-Broadway theater or be transformed into a 240-seat Off-Broadway theater, the Johnson Theater opened in 1991 with Grandchild of Kings by Hal Prince. The theater is used for large-scale productions, including the annual Bread & Puppet nativity during the holiday season and an annual pow-wow coordinated by the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers. =Cino Theater= The Cino Theater is named after Joe Cino and is the third space in TNC's history to bear Cino's name. A long and shallow theater with 74 seats, the Cino Theater is TNC's most modifiable space, and has been at times arranged as a thrust stage and an arena stage. =Cabaret Theater= The Cabaret Theater was renovated along with TNC's basement in 1999 and at 65 seats is TNC's smallest theater. An ersatz-Black Box type space, one-person plays and late-night cabarets often use this space, which as The Womb Room during the Annual Halloween Ball, showcases work by new performance artists and musicians. =Community Space Theater= The Community Space Theater was the last theater to be renovated in 2001. It has 91 seats and a sprung wood dance floor. Initially, this space consisted of risers and a stage concealed from the lobby by a heavy black curtain. During the renovation of 2001, an outer wall was added, and a formal dressing room was created as well. =Lobby Space and basement= TNC's Lobby Space is used as an Art Gallery year-round, and also contains a small concession stand which is open during performances. TNC's Basement houses the Theater's vast collection of Costumes and Props. Part of the 12-story condominium tower, the New Theater Building, behind the theater Controversy The renovation of Theater for the New City came at a great cost to its relationship with the community in 2000 when Mayor Rudolph Giuliani sold the air rights above the theater (which the City had retained) to a developer. TNC was at that time in default of a loan borrowed against a pledged grant from the Manhattan Borough President's Office, which never materialized. The City put a lien against TNC in 1997 and unable to find a major donor to pay off the $519,634 lien, TNC was forced to agree to the construction of a 12-story tower above their space in order to have the lien forgiven. \\"New City Associates, LLC.\\", Real Estate Weekly, May 24, 2000. The Faustian deal was somewhat sweetened by giving TNC an extension on their mortgage and allowing the theater to have one seat on the condo board. Being vastly taller than the 6-story tenement buildings prevalent in the Lower East Side, the condo tower was seen as a threat to the character of the neighborhood and construction in 2000 occurred amidst great protest.Hannaham, James, \\"Theater for the New Condos\\", The Village Voice, August 7th 2001. The tower became even more of a controversy when the developer hired non-union workers to build the tower.Robbins, Tom, \\"Tower of East 10th Street\\", The Village Voice, July 10th 2001.

She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in the spring of 2004 and died, aged 52, on October 20, 2004. She taught film making and editing in the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison until her death. She was born in 1952 and raised near Boston, Massachusetts. She received her BA in 1975 in Germanic linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and her Master of Fine Arts in film production from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1979. While at UCLA she served as a research assistant in Old Icelandic language and linguistics under Dr. Jesse Byock. Keene worked in various capacities in the film industry in Los Angeles while attending graduate school, including positions as a recordist for a sound studio, a dialogue editor in a post- production house, a projectionist, and a re-recording mixer at UCLA. She produced three short films as a graduate student ‚Äì Friends (1977), Still (1978) and Hinterland (1983). In 1986 after returning from her Fulbright year she wrote the script for The Juniper Tree and returned to shoot the film in 1987 on location in Iceland. It was the first film to star the well-known singer and actress Bj√∂rk, in the role of a young child in a story based on a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm. She won a Verna Fields Memorial Scholarship from UCLA in 1987 for editing The Juniper Tree, completing it in 1989. It has been screened in more than 23 festivals and invitational events around the world, including the Sundance Film Festival, the Harvard Film Archive, and the Art Institute of Chicago. It won the Prix du Public at the Festival des Films des Femmes de Montreal in 1990 and the First Prize for First Film at the Troia International Film Festival in Troia, Portugal in 1991. She produced a short film, Aves, in 1994, with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and from the University of Miami, which used innovative animation techniques to illuminate the spiritual state of a cloistered nun. This can again be seen in her second feature film, Heroine of Hell, which was funded by a grant from the Independent Television Service, a PBS-backed production initiative launched in the early 1990s to develop innovative creative work for public television. She shot Heroine of Hell, a narrative combining medieval iconography with a present-day storyline and starring Catherine Keener and Dermot Mulroney, on location in Miami, completing it in 1995. It was distributed via PBS to member stations in 1996. A full-length script, Sleeping Beauty, was optioned by an independent filmmaker in Los Angeles in 1991. Keene had two projects in progress at the time of her death. One, a script entitled Belle, was based on the true story of a female serial killer, Belle Gunness, in La Porte, Indiana, in the early years of the 20th century. She had nearly completed a third feature film, Barefoot to Jerusalem, at the time of her death. Barefoot to Jerusalem is a story of a woman's journey, after her lover's suicide, through a solitary landscape which brings her into battle with the devil. The film was shot on location in Madison, Wisconsin and in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in 2001 and was in the final stages of post-production at the time of her death.

Bergman (1872‚Äì1962) was the first elected mayor of Beverly, Alberta after Beverly was incorporated as a town in 1914. Biography Carl Gustaf Bergman was born to Swedish American parents in Paxton, Illinois. His mother was killed in an accident with a train when Bergman was only seven years old. Because his father was unable to care for him, he was forced to work. He later attended Drake University. He moved to Canada in the early 1900s, settling first near Erskine, Alberta, before moving to the Beverly area in 1912. He bought 36 lots in Beverly's Beacon Heights subdivision. When Beverly incorporated as a town in 1914, he ran for mayor, was elected and served a single term. During his term, Beverly's police force and fire brigade were established. In 1917, he moved back to Erskine and took up farming. Bergman returned to Edmonton briefly in 1962 to attend the ceremonies marking Beverly's amalgamation with the City of Edmonton. He died later the same year and was buried in Edmonton. The Edmonton neighborhood of Bergman, located just to the north of the old Beverly townsite, was named in his honour in 1987.

Taxonomy In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the blue-naped parrot in his Ornithologie based on a specimen collected on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. He used the French name Le perroquet de l'Isle de Lu√ßon and the Latin name Psittacus lucionensis. The two stars () at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the blue-naped parrot. Linnaeus included a terse description, used the binomial name Psittacus lucionensis and cited Brisson's work. The specific name lucionensis is from Luzon in the Philippines. This species is now placed in the genus Tanygnathus which was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Wagler in 1832. There are four subspecies: * T. l. lucionensis: Luzon and Mindoro * T. l. hybridus: Polillo Islands. Blue on crown less extensive, tinged with violet. More green on wing coverts. * T. l. salvadorii: Rest of Philippines * T. l. talautensis: Talaud Description This is a medium size parrot, around in length, primarily green except for a light blue rear crown and nape, pale blue lower back and rump, scalloped shoulders with orange-brown on black coverts, and blackish underwings with green underwing coverts. Distribution and ecology The species is widespread throughout the Philippines, including the Talaud Islands and islands off north and east Borneo (with introduced population in Borneo itself, e.g. Kota Kinabalu). It is found in secondary forest, at forest edges and in plantations at elevations of up to 1000 m. Flock size is usually under a dozen. The blue-naped parrot feeds on mangoes, berries, seeds, nuts and grains. It nests in tree holes. Conservation Habitat loss and trapping have has made this species scarce on most islands except Mindoro and Palawan. The Katala Foundation has raised concerns over the increasing illegal trade of this bird on Palawan.

By weight, polyethylene strands are five to ten times sturdier than steel. Multifilament line is similar to braided dacron in terms of sensitivity but a diameter about one-third that of monofilament. Multifilament works best on conventional and baitcasting reels. On spinning and spincasting reels, the line's limpness can make sure for awkward manipulation, as it doesn't \\"spring\\" off the reel like monofilament. Consequently, knot-tying is more difficult with multifilaments. Certain knots work better with superline, like the palomar knot. Applying a type of super glue will help to prevent other types of knots from slipping. This type of fishing line is expensive, sometimes four times the cost of equivalent monofilament. This can become a considerable expense, especially considering that the line is so thin that you need more of it to fill a reel spool.

Nakam (, \\"Revenge\\") was a group of about fifty Holocaust survivors who, in 1945, sought to kill Germans and Nazis in revenge for the murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust. Led by Abba Kovner, the group sought to kill six million Germans in a form of indiscriminate revenge, \\"a nation for a nation\\". Kovner went to Mandatory Palestine in order to secure large quantities of poison for poisoning water mains to kill large numbers of Germans, and his followers infiltrated the water system of Nuremberg. However, Kovner was arrested by the British on his return to Europe and had to throw the poison overboard. Following this failure, the rest of the group turned their attention to \\"Plan B\\", targeting German prisoners of war held by the United States. They obtained arsenic locally and infiltrated the bakeries that supplied these prison camps. The conspirators poisoned 3,000 loaves of bread at Konsum-Genossenschaftsb√§ckerei (Consumer Cooperative Bakery) in Nuremberg, which sickened more than 2,000 German prisoners of war at Langwasser internment camp. However, no known deaths can be attributed to the group. Although Nakam is considered by some to have been a terrorist organization, German prosecutors dismissed a case against two of its members due to the \\"unusual circumstances\\". Background During the Holocaust, Nazi Germany, its allies and collaborators murdered about six million Jews, by a variety of methods, including mass shootings and gassing. Many survivors, having lost their entire families and communities, had difficulty imagining a return to a normal life. The desire for revenge, either against Nazi war criminals or the entire German people, was widespread. From late 1942, as news of the Holocaust arrived in Mandatory Palestine, Jewish newspapers were full of calls for retribution. One of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, Yitzhak Zuckerman, later claimed that he \\"didn‚Äôt know a Jew who wasn‚Äôt obsessed with revenge\\". However, very few survivors acted on these fantasies, instead focusing on rebuilding their lives and communities and commemorating those who had perished. In all, Israeli historian Dina Porat estimates that about 200 or 250 Holocaust survivors attempted to exact violent revenge, of which Nakam was a significant portion. Including assassinations carried out by Mossad, these operations claimed the lives of as many as 1,000 to 1,500 people. Formation Jewish partisans in Vilnius after the liberation; Kovner standing, center. In 1945, Abba Kovner, after visiting the site of the Ponary massacre and the extermination camp at Majdanek, and meeting survivors of Auschwitz in Romania, decided to take revenge. He recruited about 50 Holocaust survivors, mostly former Jewish partisans, but including a few who had escaped to the Soviet Union. Recruited for their ability to live undercover and not break down, most were in their early twenties and hailed from Vilnius, Rovno, Czƒôstochowa, or Krak√≥w. Generally known as Nakam (\\"Revenge\\"), the organization used the Hebrew name ◊ì◊ô◊ü (Din, \\"judgement\\"), also an acronym of ◊ì◊ù ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊†◊ï◊ò◊® (Dam Yisrael Noter, \\"the blood of Israel avenges\\"). The group's members believed that the defeat of Nazi Germany did not mean that Jews were safe from another Holocaust-level genocide. Kovner believed that a proportional revenge, killing six million Germans, was the only way to teach enemies of the Jews that they could not act with impunity: \\"The act should be shocking. The Germans should know that after Auschwitz there can be no return to normality.\\" According to survivors, Kovner's \\"hypnotic\\" eloquence put words to the emotions that they were feeling. Members of the group believed that the laws of the time were unable to adequately punish such an extreme event as the Holocaust and that the complete moral bankruptcy of the world could only be cured by catastrophic retributive violence. Porat hypothesizes that Nakam was \\"a necessary stage\\" before the embittered survivors would be prepared \\"to return to a life of society and laws\\". The group's leaders formed two plans: Plan A, to kill a large number of Germans, and Plan B, to poison several thousand SS prisoners held in United States prisoner of war camps. From Romania Kovner's group traveled to Italy, where Kovner received a warm reception from Jewish Brigade soldiers who wanted him to help organize Aliyah Bet (illegal immigration to Mandate Palestine). Kovner refused because he was already set on revenge. Nakam developed a network of underground cells and immediately set out raising money, infiltrating German infrastructure, and securing poison. The group received a large supply of German-forged British currency from a Hashomer Hatzair emissary, forced speculators to contribute, and also obtained some money from sympathizers in the Jewish Brigade.  Plan A (planned mass poisoning in Nuremberg)  Joseph Harmatz, posing as a Polish displaced person (DP) named \\"Maim Mendele\\", attempted to infiltrate the municipal water supply in Nuremberg; Nakam targeted the city because it had been the stronghold of the Nazi Party. Harmatz had difficulty finding rooms for the conspirators to rent due to the housing shortage caused by the destruction of most of the city by Allied bombing. Through the use of bribes, he managed to place Willek Schwerzreich (Wilek Shinar), an engineer from Krak√≥w who spoke fluent German, in a position with the municipal water company. Schwarzreich obtained the plan of the water system and control of the main water valve, and plotted where the poison should be introduced so as to kill the largest possible number of Germans. In Paris, was in charge of a Nakam cell including Vitka Kempner, Kovner's future wife and former comrade in the Vilna Ghetto underground. Reichman reportedly spoke to David Ben-Gurion during the latter's trip to a DP camp in Germany, but the latter preferred to work towards Israeli independence than seek revenge for the Holocaust. It fell to Kovner to obtain the poison from leaders in the Yishuv, the Jewish leadership in Mandatory Palestine. In July 1945, Kovner left the Jewish Brigade for Milan, disguising himself as a Jewish Brigade soldier on leave, and boarded a ship for Palestine the following month. Reichman became leader in Europe in his absence. Upon reaching Palestine, Kovner was held for three days in an apartment by the Mossad LeAliyah Bet and was personally interrogated by Mossad chief Shaul Meirov. Kovner negotiated with Haganah chiefs Moshe Sneh and Israel Galilee in hopes of convincing them to give him poison for a smaller revenge operation in return for not linking the murder to the Yishuv. In September, Kovner informed Nakam in Europe that he had not had any success in locating poison, and therefore they should recruit Yitzhak Ratner, a chemist and former Vilna Ghetto insurgent, and focus on Plan B. Kovner was eventually introduced to Ephraim and Aharon Katzir, chemists at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, via one of their students who was a member of the Haganah. The Katzir brothers were sympathetic to Kovner's revenge plot and convinced the head of chemical storage at the Hebrew University to give him poison. Decades after the fact, Kovner claimed that he had pitched Plan B to Chaim Weizmann, then president of the World Zionist Organization, who had directed him to the Katzir brothers. However, according to his biographer, if Kovner met Weizmann at all it was in February or March 1946, as Weizmann was out of the country before that. After several delays, Kovner traveled to Alexandria, Egypt, in December 1945 carrying false papers that identified him as a Jewish Brigade soldier returning from leave, and a duffel with gold hidden in toothpaste tubes and cans full of poison. Shortly after boarding a ship headed to Toulon, France, Kovner's name along with three others was called over the public address system. Kovner told a friend, Yitzik Rosenkranz, to convey the duffel to Kempner in Paris, and then threw half the poison overboard. After this, he turned himself in and was arrested by the British police. Nakam members later claimed that Kovner had been betrayed by the Haganah, but Porat writes that it is more likely that he was arrested as a suspected organizer of Aliyah Bet. Kovner, who spoke no English and had not attended the Jewish Brigade training, was not questioned about Nakam; after two months in jails in Egypt and Palestine, he was released. His involvement in Nakam ended at that time.  Plan B (mass poisoning of SS prisoners)  Because Kovner had not managed to secure the quantity of poison required, the Nuremberg cell decided to switch to poisoning SS prisoners definitively during the first months of 1946. Most of the Nakam action groups disbanded as ordered and their members dispersed into displaced persons camps, promised by the leaders that in future they would be reactivated to implement Plan A. The cells in Nuremberg and Dachau remained active because of the large United States prisoner of war camps nearby. Yitzhak Ratner was recruited into the group to obtain poison locally. In October 1945, he set up a laboratory in the Nakam headquarters in Paris, where he tested various formulations in order to find a tasteless, odorless poison that would have delayed effects. Ratner eventually formulated a mixture of arsenic, glue, and other additives which could be painted onto loaves of bread; tests on cats proved the lethality of the mixture. He obtained more than of arsenic from friends who worked in the tanning industry, which was smuggled into Germany. The Konsum- Genossenschaftsb√§ckerei (Consumer Cooperative Bakery) in Nuremberg Nakam focused on Langwasser internment camp near Nuremberg (formerly Stalag XIII-D), where 12,000 to 15,000 prisoners, mainly former SS officers or prominent Nazis, were imprisoned by the United States. Initially, two Nakam members were hired by the camp, one as a driver, another as a storehouse worker. The bread for Langwasser came from a single bakery in Nuremberg, the Konsum- Genossenschaftsb√§ckerei (Consumer Cooperative Bakery). Leipke Distel, a survivor of several Nazi concentration camps, posed as a Polish displaced person awaiting a visa to work at an uncle's bakery in Canada. He asked the manager if he could work for free and eventually secured access to the bakery storeroom after bribing him with cigarettes, alcohol, and chocolate. The Nakam operatives met each night in a rented room in F√ºrth to discuss their findings, especially how to confine their attack to the German prisoners and avoid harming the American guards. When Harmatz placed a few of the workers in clerical positions in the camp, they discovered that on Sundays, the black bread would be eaten only by the German prisoners because the American guards were specially issued white bread. Therefore, they decided to execute the attack on a Saturday night. Similar preparations were made with regard to a prison camp near Dachau and the bakery supplying it, an effort led by Warsaw Ghetto uprising veteran Simcha Rotem. After making friends with Poles who worked in the bakery, Rotem got the manager drunk, made copies of the keys, and returned them before he sobered up. A few days before the planned attack, Reichman received a tip-off from a Jewish intelligence officer in the United States Army that two of the operatives were wanted by the police. As ordered, the Dachau Nakam operatives aborted on 11 April 1946. Reichman feared that the failure of one attack would cause the United States to increase its security measures at prison camps, preventing a second attack. By this time, six Nakam members worked at the Konsum-Genossenschaftsb√§ckerei in Nuremberg. Subverting tight security aimed at preventing the theft of food, they smuggled the arsenic in over several days, hiding it under raincoats, and stashed it beneath the floorboards. Because experiments had shown that the arsenic mixture did not spread evenly, the operatives decided to paint it onto the bottom of each loaf. On Saturday, 13 April, the bakery workers were on strike, delaying the Nakam operatives and preventing three of them from entering the bakery. As a result, Distel and his two accomplices only had time to poison some 3,000 loaves of bread instead of 14,000 as originally planned. After painting the loaves, they fled to Czechoslovakia, helped by an Auschwitz survivor named Yehuda Maimon, continuing on through Italy to southern France. On 23 April 1946, The New York Times reported that 2,283 German prisoners of war had fallen ill from poisoning, with 207 hospitalized and seriously ill. However, the operation ultimately caused no known deaths. According to documents obtained by a Freedom of Information request to the National Archives and Records Administration, the amount of arsenic found in the bakery was enough to kill approximately 60,000 persons. It is unknown why the poisoners failed, but it is suspected either to be that they spread the poison too thinly, or else that the prisoners realized that the bread had been poisoned and did not eat very much. Aftermath and legacy Kibbutz Ein HaHoresh in 1940 About 30 former Nakam operatives boarded the ship Biriya on 23 June 1946 and arrived by the end of July following brief detention by the British authorities. They received a warm welcome at Kovner's kibbutz, Ein HaHoresh, from leading members of the Haganah and the Israeli Labor Party, and were invited to travel through the country. Although Kovner, and the majority of the operatives, considered that the time for revenge had passed, a small group led by Bolek Ben-Ya'akov returned to Europe to continue the mission. Nine other Nakam operatives broke away in the spring of 1947 and returned to Europe the following year, helped by Labor Party politician Abba Hushi. The breakaway groups faced mounting challenges, both logistical and financial, and the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 made illegal operations even more difficult. Many of the members turned to a life of crime to support themselves, and then tried to escape from German jails with the help of former French Resistance members. Most returned to Israel between 1950 and 1952. Ben-Ya'akov said in an interview that he \\"could not have looked at himself in the mirror\\" if he had not tried to get revenge, and that he still deeply regretted that it did not succeed. After coming to Israel, former Nakam members refused to speak about their experiences for several decades, only beginning to discuss the issue in the 1980s. Porat writes that Kovner \\"committed political suicide\\" by participating in Nakam; she describes its failure as a \\"miracle\\". According to Israeli terrorism experts Ehud Sprinzak and Idith Zertal, Nakam's worldview was similar to messianic groups or cults because of its belief that the world was so evil as to deserve large-scale catastrophe. Unlike most terrorist organizations which commit violence for political reasons and hope for a new, better future through terror, Nakam wanted to kill indiscriminately. The Nakam operatives came from \\"heavily brutalized communities\\" which, according to Sprinzak and Zertal, sometimes consider catastrophic violence. Members of the group showed no remorse, said that the Germans \\"deserved it\\", and wanted recognition, rather than forgiveness, for their actions. , four members of the group are reported to be still alive. =2000 investigation= In 1999, Harmatz and Distel appeared in a documentary and discussed their role in Nakam. Distel maintained that Nakam's actions were moral and that the Jews \\"had a right to revenge against the Germans\\". German prosecutors opened an investigation against them for attempted murder, but halted the preliminary investigation in 2000 because of the \\"unusual circumstances\\". =Historiography and popular culture= An early journalistic account of Nakam's mission is in Michael Bar-Zohar's 1969 book The Avengers. The story was given a fictionalized treatment in Forged in Fire by Michael Elkins in 1971. The story of Nakam has also entered German popular culture. In 2009, Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird, a Germany-based klezmer band, recorded a song called \\"Six Million Germans (Nakam)\\". Based on tapes Kovner made on his deathbed describing his activities in Nakam, a television documentary was produced by Channel 4 for its Secret History series titled Holocaust ‚Äì The Revenge Plot, which was first broadcast on Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2018. Dina Porat is the first academic historian to systematically study the group, meeting with many of the survivors and gaining access to their private documents. She hypothesizes that the failure of the attack may have been deliberate, as Kovner and other leaders began to realize that it could have greatly harmed the Jewish people. She struggled to reconcile the personality of Nakam's members with the actions that they tried to carry out. Asked how he could plan an attack in which many innocent people would have been killed, one survivor explained that \\"If you had been there with me, at the end of the war, you wouldn‚Äôt talk that way\\". Her 2019 book on Nakam is titled \\"Vengeance and Retribution are Mine\\" (), a phrase from the Psalms, in order to express her belief that vengeance is best left to God.

Sitka sailed from Manila on 28 November carrying homeward-bound servicemen and arrived at Seattle, Washington on 14 December. Sitka remained at Seattle for repairs until sailing to Saipan and Guam on 30 January 1946. The ship arrived at San Pedro on 23 February and got underway for the east coast on 1 March. On 16 March she arrived at Norfolk for deactivation. =In mercantile service, 1946-1976= Sitka was decommissioned on 14 May 1946, returned to the War Shipping Administration the next day, and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 June 1946. She was sold into mercantile service to Pope & Talbot Lines in 1947 and renamed SS P&T; Trader; resold in 1957 to Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., and renamed SS Mormacguide; and resold in 1964 to the American Foreign Steamship Company and renamed SS American Condor in 1964. The ship was scrapped in 1976.

If R is a commutative ring and m is a maximal ideal, then the residue field is the quotient ring k = R/m, which is a field. Frequently, R is a local ring and m is then its unique maximal ideal. This construction is applied in algebraic geometry, where to every point x of a scheme X one associates its residue field k(x). One can say a little loosely that the residue field of a point of an abstract algebraic variety is the 'natural domain' for the coordinates of the point. Definition Suppose that R is a commutative local ring, with the maximal ideal m. Then the residue field is the quotient ring R/m. Now suppose that X is a scheme and x is a point of X. By the definition of scheme, we may find an affine neighbourhood U = Spec(A), with A some commutative ring. Considered in the neighbourhood U, the point x corresponds to a prime ideal p ‚äÇ A (see Zariski topology). The local ring of X in x is by definition the localization R = Ap, with the maximal ideal m = p¬∑Ap. Applying the construction above, we obtain the residue field of the point x : :k(x) := Ap / p¬∑Ap. One can prove that this definition does not depend on the choice of the affine neighbourhood U.Intuitively, the residue field of a point is a local invariant. Axioms of schemes are set up in such a way as to assure the compatibility between various affine open neighborhoods of a point, which implies the statement. A point is called K-rational for a certain field K, if k(x) = K.G√∂rtz, Ulrich and Wedhorn, Torsten. Algebraic Geometry: Part 1: Schemes (2010) Vieweg+Teubner Verlag. Example Consider the affine line A1(k) = Spec(k[t]) over a field k. If k is algebraically closed, there are exactly two types of prime ideals, namely *(t ‚àí a), a ‚àà k *(0), the zero- ideal. The residue fields are *k[t]_{(t-a)}/(t-a)k[t]_{(t-a)} \\\\cong k *k[t]_{(0)} \\\\cong k(t), the function field over k in one variable. If k is not algebraically closed, then more types arise, for example if k = R, then the prime ideal (x2 + 1) has residue field isomorphic to C. Properties * For a scheme locally of finite type over a field k, a point x is closed if and only if k(x) is a finite extension of the base field k. This is a geometric formulation of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In the above example, the points of the first kind are closed, having residue field k, whereas the second point is the generic point, having transcendence degree 1 over k. * A morphism Spec(K) ‚Üí X, K some field, is equivalent to giving a point x ‚àà X and an extension K/k(x). * The dimension of a scheme of finite type over a field is equal to the transcendence degree of the residue field of the generic point.

Note how marginal costs can fluctuate between MC1 and MC3 without the equilibrium quantity or price changing. The Kinked-Demand curve theory is an economic theory regarding oligopoly and monopolistic competition. Kinked demand was an initial attempt to explain sticky prices.  Theory \\"Kinked\\" demand curves and traditional demand curves are similar in that they are both downward-sloping. They are distinguished by a hypothesized concave bend with a discontinuity at the bend - the \\"kink.\\" Therefore, the first derivative point is undefined and leads to a jump discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve. Classical economic theory assumes that a profit-maximizing producer with some market power (either due to oligopoly or monopolistic competition) will set marginal costs equal to marginal revenue. This idea can be envisioned graphically by the intersection of an upward-sloping marginal cost curve and a downward-sloping marginal revenue curve . In classical theory, any change in the marginal cost structure or the marginal revenue structure will be immediately reflected in a new price and/or quantity sold of the item. This result does not occur if a \\"kink\\" exists. Because of this jump discontinuity in the marginal revenue curve, marginal costs could change without necessarily changing the price or quantity. Formulation Hall and Hitch's graphical illustration of kinked demand The two seminal papers on kinked demand were written nearly simultaneously in 1939 on both sides of the Atlantic. Paul Sweezy of Harvard College published \\"Demand Under Conditions of Oligopoly.\\" Sweezy argued that an ordinary demand curve does not apply to oligopoly markets and promotes a kinked demand curve. From Queen's College in Oxford, Robert Lowe Hall and Charles J. Hitch wrote \\"Price Theory and Business Behavior,\\" presenting similar ideas but including more rigorous empirical testing, including a business survey of 39 respondents in the manufacturing industry. Hall and Hitch further present a hypothesis for the initial setting of prices; this explains why the \\"kink\\" in the curve is located where it is. They base this on a notion of \\"full cost\\" - marginal cost of each unit plus a percent of overhead costs or fixed costs with an additional percent added for profit. They emphasize the importance of industry tradition in history in determining this initial price, noting further, \\"An overwhelming majority of the entrepreneurs thought that a price based on full average cost‚Ä¶was the ‚Äòright‚Äô price, the one which ‚Äòought‚Äô to be charged.\\" Criticism Others such as George Stigler have argued against kinked demand. His primary opposition is summarized in a Working Paper out of the Stanford University Economics Department by seminal authors Elmore, Kautz, Walls et al. New classical economists, led by Chicago‚Äôs George Stigler, worked to discredit the kinked demand models. Stigler first argues that the kinked demand models are not useful, as Hall and Hitch‚Äôs model only explains observed phenomenon and is not predictive. He further explains that the kinked demand analysis only suggests why prices remain sticky and does not describe the mechanism that establishes the kink and how the kink can reform once prices change. Stigler also asserts that the model is unnecessary because Chicago theory already included allowances for short-run sticky prices due to collusion, menu costs, and regulatory or bureaucratic inefficiencies in markets. Contemporary reformulation Game theory and models of strategic interaction have largely replaced kinked demand to explain price dislocations and slowly adjusting prices.

Publication history Marvel Comics' science-fiction anthology Worlds Unknown ran eight issues, cover-dated May 1973 to August 1974. The title was one of four launched by Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Roy Thomas to form a line of science fiction and horror anthologies with more thematic cohesiveness than the company's earlier attempts that decade, which had included such series as Chamber of Darkness and Tower of Shadows. Whereas those titles generally presented original stories, these new books would instead adapt genre classics and other works. With the four titles' debuts set to be staggered over the course of four months, Marvel premiered Journey into Mystery vol. 2 (Oct. 1972), Chamber of Chills (Nov. 1972), Supernatural Thrillers (Dec. 1972), and, with a late start, Worlds Unknown (May 1973). The first issue featured Frederik Pohl's \\"The Day after the Day the Martians Came\\", adapted by writer Gerry Conway and artist Ralph Reese, and \\"He that Hath Wings\\", adapted by writer-penciler Gil Kane from a 1934 Edmond Hamilton story published in the pulp magazine Popular Fiction. It also included a story from Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Atlas Comics: the three-page \\"Nightmare at Noon\\", with art by Angelo Torres, from Astonishing #54 (Oct. 1956).Worlds Unknown at the Grand Comics Database Subsequent issues included such adaptations as L. Sprague de Camp's 1956 \\"A Gun for Dinosaur\\", by writer Thomas and penciler Val Mayerik (#2); Harry Bates' 1940 \\"Farewell to the Master\\", with Thomas and penciler Ross Andru adapting the source material of the film classic The Day the Earth Stood Still (#3); Fredric Brown's 1944 \\"Arena\\", with Conway and penciler John Buscema on a short story previously adapted for an episode of the TV series Star Trek (#4); A. E. van Vogt's first published SF story, \\"Black Destroyer\\" (1939), by Thomas and penciler Dan Adkins (#5); and Ted Sturgeon's 1944 \\"Killdozer\\", by Conway and penciler Dick Ayers (#6). The final two issues changed direction and featured an adaptation of the contemporaneous film The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974), based on the screenplay by Brian Clemens and the story by Clemens and Ray Harryhausen. Titled The Golden Voyage of Sinbad: Land of the Lost, it was by writer Len Wein and penciler George Tuska. Although Marvel had announced plans to follow the Sinbad adaptation with a new, original lead feature titled \\"Cyborg,\\"\\"Far- Out Fanfare and Infoomation!\\", FOOM, November 1973, p. 18 it instead cancelled the comic and ran the feature in Astonishing Tales as \\"Deathlok.\\" Five months after the title's cancellation, Marvel would revisit the idea of science- fiction story adaptations with the black-and-white comics magazine Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction, which ran for six issues plus an annual from 1975 to 1976. Critical assessment Critic David A. Roach wrote of the series: \\"[T]he best issues are those featuring Gil Kane or Ralph Reese....

Richer brown in colour than other pipits in the region, it is distinctive in having the streaking on the breast continuing along the flanks. It is non-migratory and has a tendency to fly into low trees when disturbed and is closely related to the tree pipits Anthus hodgsoni and Anthus trivialis. Description The streaking extends along the flanks The Nilgiri pipit is about long and is richly coloured, has dark lores, a buff supercilium and throat. It lacks any malar stripes. The flanks, breast and sides of neck are brighter buff and that bill is completely dark. The crown is heavily streaked in black as are the upperparts. The outer tail feathers are also buff coloured and there is no white in the plumage. The streaking on the breast is fine and it extends along the flanks. The first four primaries of the wing are almost equal and the fifth is about 1‚Äì2 mm shorter. The primaries from the second to the fifth are emarginate. The tail feathers are pointed and the second outer feather has a tapering triangle along the shaft and the third with a small triangle at the tip. Abnormal albino individuals have been reported. Taxonomy The species was first described by Jerdon in 1840 under the name of Anthus rufescens, a name already used by Temminck for a different species. Blyth referred to it under the name of Anthus montanus. These are however invalid names and it was redescribed under replacement name of A. nilghiriensis by Richard Bowdler Sharpe in 1885. The Nilgiri pipit is closely related to the tree pipits and is a sister to the clade containing Anthus trivialis and Anthus hodgsoni from which it diverged in the Pliocene.162x162px  Distribution and habitat  The Nilgiri pipit is closely associated with short montane grasslands interspersed with marshy grounds and small streams mostly in hill slopes above in the Ponmudi hills and above in the Nilgiris, Palani and High Ranges. They have also been claimed to occur in the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve but a 2014 study suggests that the species is restricted to the high altitude grassy peaks of the Nilgiris and the Anamalais. Museum specimens exist from the Palani ranges but habitat changes may have led to its reduction or extirpation as the species was not found in later surveys. Behaviour Nilgiri pipits are found singly or in pairs. When disturbed they usually fly into a low bush or tree. They breed in summer from April to July. The nest is a cup of grass in short grass. The clutch consists of two to three grey brown speckled eggs. They feed on grass seeds and insects with invertebrates becoming more important during the breeding season. Status The world population is estimated to be about 4000 birds based on a density estimate of about 0.1 birds per hectare in suitable habitat. The grassland habitat is threatened by wattle plantations and the colonization of grasslands by species such as broom (Cytisus scoparius) in the Nilgiris and by fire.

Few of Werner's works survive to the present day, and he is mostly remembered for his troubled relationship with Haydn. Career Werner was born in Ybbs an der Donau.\\"Werner, Gregor Joseph\\" by Hubert Unverricht, Grove Music Online He served from 1715 to either 1716 or 1721 (unknown) as the organist at Melk Abbey. During the 1720s he was in Vienna, where he may have studied with Johann Fux. Werner was married on 27 January 1727. On 10 May 1728 he took up the position he was to hold for the rest of his life, as Kapellmeister at the Esterh√°zy court in Schloss Esterh√°zy in Eisenstadt. The appointment \\"opened a new era for music\\"Jones (2008, 435) at the court; previously, there had been seven years of relative inactivity following the death of Prince Joseph in 1721; his widow Maria Octavia, serving as co-regent for her young son Paul Anton, had instituted economies in the musical establishment.Robbins Landon and Jones (1988, 35) Robbins Landon and Jones suggest that Werner was hired at the then 17-year-old prince's instigation. Werner set to work, bringing new music to the court from Vienna and composing prolifically. He remained in full charge of the Esterh√°zy musical establishment until 1761, when he entered a period of semi-retirement, his responsibilities limited to church music. Throughout this time he worked for a prince who was himself highly musical: Paul Anton had received musical training from the court musicians as well as from music masters imported from abroad; he played the violin and the flute.Strauss (2009, 30) Werner died in Eisenstadt on 3 March 1766. Works Werner wrote a cappella masses in a strict contrapuntal style, as well as church music with instrumental accompaniment and symphonies. His work includes a series of twenty oratorios, all composed for performance on Good Friday, usually in the Esterh√°zy chapel.Jones (2008, 436) Jones discerns a bifurcated style, with most of the work taking the form of severe, \\"weighty\\" contrapuntal pieces, but a minority (written for lighter occasions such as Advent and the Nativity) that \\"employ a distinctly homespun idiom, invoking elements of Austrian and indeed Eastern European folk music.\\" Works by Joseph Haydn in both genres exist, and may have been influenced by Werner. As an employee of the Esterh√°zy family Werner published little, but a few works did see print. These include his set of twelve orchestral suites depicting the twelve months of the year (Neuer und sehr curios-Musicalischer Instrumental-Calender (\\"New and very curious musical instrument calendar\\"),Translation from Randel (2003, 682) which appeared in Augsburg in 1748. His pupils included S. T. Kolbel (K√∂lbel)Possibly Simon Thad√§us K√∂lbel, died 20 July 1806. See Musicsack: http://www.musicsack.com/PersonFMTDetail.cfm?PersonPK=100252399 . and the Esterh√°zy organist Johann Novotn√Ω (1718‚Äì1765), father of Franz Nikolaus Novotn√Ω (1743‚Äì1773).\\"Novotn√Ω, Franz Nikolaus\\" by Camillo Schoenbaum, Grove Music Online Autograph scores and parts by Gregor Joseph Werner have found their way into the collection of the Orsz√°gos Sz√©ch√©nyi K√∂nyvt√°r, Budapest,R√©pertoire International des Sources Musicales ‚Äì search for Werner at opac.rism.info, click on Autograph, they are all under \\"H-Bn\\", which one discovers is the \\"Segel\\" (sign) for this library. as well as the public archives in Gy≈ër, Hungary. Relations with Haydn Werner's period of semi- retirement began in 1761 when the Esterh√°zy family hired the 29-year-old composer Joseph Haydn as their Vice-Kapellmeister. The contract by which Haydn was hired shows the family's loyalty to their elderly musical servant by retaining him, at least on a titular basis, in the top post of Kapellmeister. However, after this time Werner's musical duties were limited to church music, and Haydn, 39 years younger than Werner, had the primary duties, with full control over the secular musical events of the household, including the orchestra.Geiringer (1982, 43) This was a time of changes probably unwelcome to Werner. His longtime patron Paul Anton died in March 1762, succeeded by his younger brother Nikolaus Esterh√°zy. Nikolaus was also a very musical prince, but his interests (Jones) \\"lay with Haydn and the development of instrumental music.\\" Haydn initially received the same salary (400 florins per year) that Werner had long received, but in June 1762 this was increased to 600.Jones (2009, 43) In addition, Werner had lived to see the kind of music he composed become outmoded. His own work emphasized the contrapuntal textures of the Baroque era, whereas by 1761 the new forms of the Classical period, often with a single melody set over an accompaniment figure, had come to the fore. Jones says, \\"he had become too old to appreciate the rapidly developing fashion for symphonies, quartets, and keyboard sonatas, genres in which Haydn was already acquiring a name for himself.\\"Jones (2009, 34) Werner expressed his distaste by calling Haydn a \\"G'sanglmacher\\" (writer of little songs) and \\"Modehansl\\" (\\"fashion follower,\\" literally \\"little Hans of fashion\\"). Werner's discontent reached its climax in October 1765, a few months before his death, when he wrote a letter to Prince Esterh√°zy denouncing Haydn for his slackness in running the Esterh√°zy musical establishment. The letter begins: While it is natural to detect bitterness and envy in Werner's letter, Jones points out that the criticisms might well have been legitimate, and that the letter produced a useful bureaucratic response. Haydn was spread thin between serving the Prince's interests in secular music (mostly in his palace in Vienna) and in covering for the now-frail Werner the church music at the family seat in Eisenstadt. Prince Nikolaus arranged for his administrator Rahier to deal with the situation. Rahier (with whom Haydn had a difficult relationship) issued an official document,Regulatio chori KissMartoniensis, signed by Prince Esterh√°zy on 3 November 1765. \\"Kismarton\\" is the Hungarian name for Eisenstadt. Source: Gerlach (1998, 67) which reprimanded Haydn. However, it also provided a helpful clarification of Haydn's responsibilities and designated a subordinate (Joseph Dietzl) to take on the task of keeping track of the music and instruments in Eisenstadt.Source for this paragraph: Jones (2009, 54‚Äì55) The reprimand also led Haydn to begin to keep a draft catalog of all his works (the \\"Entwurf-Katalog\\").Geiringer (1982, 53) In response to a particular detail of the reprimand, Haydn began writing a great number of works in the Prince's favorite genre at the time, the baryton trio.Webster and Feder (2002, 15) Reception Werner today is an almost-forgotten composer.

It disbanded in 1998 after the majority of its member schools were forced to drop football. History The NCAC was founded as the Far Western Conference (FWC) in 1925 by its charter member schools: Fresno State, Saint Mary's, UC Davis, Nevada, San Jose State and Pacific. Nevada's departure from the conference in 1940 left the conference with only four members; Chico State, Fresno State, College of the Pacific and UC Davis. The conference looked to four nominees in Humboldt State, San Francisco State, Santa Barbara State and California Poly of San Luis Obispo. Shortly after World War II, all of these charter members, with the exception of UC Davis, would leave for other conferences, to be replaced by San Francisco State, Sacramento State, Hayward State, Southern Oregon, Sonoma State and Chico State. During the 1990s, each of the universities associated with the California State system chose to disband their football teams in order to comply with Title IX, with the exception of Humboldt State, which added two women's sports to achieve compliance and Sacramento State.

He was praised by traditional Chinese historians for his ability and lack of corruption, but blamed for flattering Emperor Yang of Sui and practically directly contributing to Sui's downfall by encouraging many external military campaigns that drained Sui's resources. Modern historians have questioned these assessments: Arthur F. Wright labelled the latter judgement in the Zizhi tongjian a \\"particularly blatant piece of editorializing\\" and \\"absurd ... beyond doubt\\".  Background  Pei Ju's clan was originally from Hedong Commandery (Ê≤≥Êù±, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His grandfather Pei Tuo (Ë£¥‰Ωó)The History of Northern Dynasties and the Old Book of Tang both gave Pei Ju's grandfather's name as Pei Tuo -- and the Book of Wei and History of Northern Dynasties both had a biography for Pei Tuo. See Book of Wei, vol. 88; History of Northern Dynasties, vol. 38 ; Old Book of Tang, vol. 63 . The Book of Sui gave his grandfather's name, however, as Pei Ta (Ë£¥‰ªñ). Book of Sui, vol. 67 . was an official for Northern Wei, and his father Pei Nazhi (Ë£¥Ë®•‰πã) served as an official during Northern Wei's branch successor state Eastern Wei and Eastern Wei's successor state Northern Qi. Pei Nazhi died when Pei Ju was young, and Pei Ju was raised by his uncle Pei Rangzhi (Ë£¥ËÆì‰πã), himself a famed official during the time. In his youth, Pei Ju was known for his knowledge and intelligence. He served on the staff of Gao Zhen (È´òË≤û) the Prince of Beiping and then of Gao Renying (È´ò‰ªÅËã±) the Prince of Gaoping, both sons of Emperor Wucheng of Northern Qi. After Northern Qi was destroyed by rival Northern Zhou in 577, it was said that Pei was stuck at his position.However, this statement, as made in all of the traditional histories' biographies of Pei, is problematic, because by that point, Gao Renying was no longer a prince (although he, unlike almost all of the other Northern Qi princes, was spared by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou), and therefore would not have eligible to have a staff any more. No explanation was given in any of the traditional histories as to which position Pei was stuck at. When the Northern Zhou general Yang Jian served as the commandant at Ding Province (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), he invited Pei to serve as his secretary. Pei later left Yang Jian's service when his mother died, to observe a mourning period. In 580, Yang Jian seized power as regent over the young Emperor Jing of Northern Zhou. He sent messengers to summon Pei, and Pei served on his staff as a secretary.  During Emperor Wen's reign  In 581, Yang Jian had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, ending Northern Zhou and establishing Sui Dynasty as its Emperor Wen. Pei Ju became a mid-level official in the new dynasty's government. In 589, when Emperor Wen sent forces to conquer the rival Chen Dynasty and to unite China, Pei Ju served as a secretary to Emperor Wen's son Yang Guang the Prince of Jin, the commander for the overall operation. After Chen's capital Jiankang fell and the emperor Chen Shubao was captured, Yang Guang had his assistant Gao Jiong and Pei collect the Chen archives. In 590, Pei was ordered to head to the Lingnan region (Â∂∫Âçó, i.e., modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam) to comfort the people there, but while he was still traveling there, nearly all of former Chen territory, with the people unfamiliar with and resenting Sui laws, erupted into rebellion. Emperor Wen initially recalled Pei, but Pei requested permission to continue, and Emperor Wen allowed him. He gathered several thousand soldiers at Nankang (ÂçóÂ∫∑, in modern Ganzhou, Jiangxi) and defeated and killed the rebel general Zhou Shiju (Âë®Â∏´Ëàâ), who served under Wang Zhongxuan (Áéã‰ª≤ÂÆ£). He then approached Guang Province (Âª£Â∑û, roughly modern Guangzhou, Guangdong), where Wang was stationed, and Wang's forces, in fear, collapsed. In all, Pei pacified more than 20 provinces, commissioning governors and county magistrates in Emperor Wen's name. After he returned to Chang'an, Emperor Wen was pleased and praised Pei greatly. He created Pei the Duke of Wenxi and awarded him a large cache of silk. He also made Pei the assistant minister of census, and then Neishi Shilang (ÂÖßÂè≤‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau of the government (ÂÖßÂè≤ÁúÅ, Neishi Sheng). At that time, one of the major threats that Sui was facing was from Eastern Tujue, to the north, particularly because its Dulan Khan Ashina Yongyul√º had married Northern Zhou's Princess Qianjin, who hated Yang for destroying Northern Zhou's imperial Yuwen clan. In 593, Pei Ju served as a Sui emissary to Eastern Tujue, and he revealed to Ashina Yongyul√º that Princess Qianjin had been committing adultery, and then further persuaded Ashina Yongyul√º's nephew and subordinate khan Tuli Khan Ashina Rangan that if he was able to get Princess Qianjin killed, Sui would be willing to let him marry a Sui princess. Ashina Rangan therefore convinced Ashina Yongyul√º that Princess Qianjin should be killed, and Ashina Yongyul√º killed Princess Qianjin. Later, Ashina Rangan was in fact allowed to marry Sui's Princess Anyi, and this led to a break between him and Ashina Yongyul√º. Emperor Wen put Ashina Rangan under Sui protection, created him Qimin Khan, and, after Princess Anyi's death, gave him Princess Yicheng in marriage. He also launched armies against Dulan Khan and the subordinate Datou Khan Ashina Dianjue, to protect Ashina Rangan. In one of those attacks, commanded by Shi Wansui (Âè≤Ëê¨Ê≠≤) the Duke of Taiping, against Ashina Dianjue, Pei served as Shi's assistant, and they achieved a great victory, but once they returned to Chang'an, Shi was falsely accused of being an adherent of the crown prince Yang Yong, with whom Emperor Wen was already displeased (and would eventually depose later that year in favor of Yang Guang) and executed, and Pei was given no rewards. Soon, Emperor Wen against sent Pei as an emissary to Ashina Rangan to comfort him and his troops; upon return to Chang'an, Pei was made deputy to the prime minister Yang Su. In 601, when Emperor Wen's wife Empress Dugu died, there were few written regulations about an empress' funeral, so new regulations were written by Pei and Niu Hong (ÁâõÂºò). Emperor Wen subsequently made him the minister of civil service affairs, and Pei was considered capable at that position.  During Emperor Yang's reign  In 604, Emperor Wen died‚Äîa death that traditional historians mostly believe to be a murder ordered by Yang Guang, although they admitted a lack of direct evidence‚Äîand was succeeded by Yang Guang (as Emperor Yang). Emperor Yang soon started the reconstruction of Luoyang to serve as the eastern capital, and he put Pei Ju in charge of building the governmental offices, which Pei completed in nine months. Meanwhile, there was a substantial central Asian merchant trade with Sui at Zhangye (ÂºµÊéñ, in modern Zhangye, Gansu), and Emperor Yang put Pei in charge of the merchant operations there. Pei knew that Emperor Yang had great ambitions of territorial expansion, and when he met with central Asian merchants, he would get information from them as to the geographical features and customs of their states. He wrote a three-volume work entitled the Maps of and Notes About the Western Regions (Ë•øÂüüÂúñË®ò, of which only the preface is still extant), and he submitted it to Emperor Yang, urging reopening of relations with and subjugation of the Xiyu states. Emperor Yang summoned Pei to discuss with him, and Pei further convinced him that Xiyu was full of treasure and that the large nearby state, Tuyuhun, could be easily conquered. Emperor Yang was enticed, and he put Pei in charge of planning the subjugation of Xiyu states and conquest of Tuyuhun. In 608, Pei persuaded the Tiele to attack Tuyuhun. Tuyuhun's khan Murong Fuyun initially sought aid from Sui, but when Emperor Yang sent his cousin Yang Xiong (Ê•äÈõÑ) the Prince of Ande and Yuwen Shu the Duke of Xu toward Tuyuhun, Murong Fuyun distrusted them and fled. Sui forces then attacked him, greatly defeating him and forcing him to flee further, seizing Tuyuhun territory and putting it under Sui control. Later that year, when Emperor Yang was set to offer sacrifices to the spirits of Mount Heng, Pei persuaded emissaries from 27 Xiyu states, headed by Qu Boya (È∫¥‰ºØÈõÖ) the King of Gaochang and Ashina Tutun (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£ÂêêÂ±Ø), the Western Tujue general in charge of Yiwu (‰ºäÂêæ, in modern Hami Prefecture, Xinjiang), to pay homage to him and to assist in offering sacrifices. Emperor Yang was greatly pleased by this and greatly awarded both Pei and all of the Xiyu emissaries.The biography for Pei Ju in the Book of Sui placed these events in 607, but the Zizhi Tongjian placed them in 608. Compare Book of Sui, vol. 67 with Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 181. In the biography for Emperor Yang in the Book of Sui, it also placed these events in 608. Book of Sui, vol. 3 . Around the same time, Emperor Yang made Pei Ju, along with Yu Shiji, Niu Hong, Su Wei, Yuwen Shu, Zhang Jin (ÂºµÁëæ), and Pei Yun (Ë£¥Ëòä) in charge of selecting and promoting officials, and they were known as the \\"seven nobles of officialdom.\\" However, it was said that the actual selective powers were in Yu's hands, and that Yu became exceedingly corrupt, making recommendations based on the amount of bribes that he received. Pei Ju, however, was known and praised for not accepting bribes. In 610, when Emperor Yang visited the headquarters of Ashina Rangan‚Äîwho had, by this point, with Sui support, become the ruler of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate (Dong Tujue)‚Äîthe emissary from Goguryeo happened to be at Ashina Rangan's headquarters as well, and Ashina Rangan had him meet with Emperor Yang. Pei then suggested to Emperor Yang that Goguryeo should be subjugated‚Äîpointing out that Goguryeo territory was formerly ruled by Han Dynasty and Jin Dynasty. Emperor Yang was enticed, and he issued an edict, to be taken back to Goguryeo's king Gao Yuan (King Yeongyang), in which he ordered King Yeongyang to visit him at Zhuo Commandery (Ê∂øÈÉ°, roughly modern Beijing) in 611 or face consequences. King Yeongyang, in fear, began to prepare for war, as did Emperor Yang, believing that conquest would be easy. (The subsequent campaigns against Goguryeo in 612, 613, and 614, particularly the one in 612, however, was disastrous for Sui, as great human and material costs were expended with only minimal territorial gains, leading eventually to Sui's downfall.) In 611, after Western Tujue's Chuluo Khan Ashina Daman similarly refused to visit Emperor Yang, Pei suggested forming an alliance with Ashina Daman's subordinate Ashina Shekui, who had been requesting to marry a Sui princess. Emperor Yang agreed, and subsequently, Ashina Shekui attacked Ashina Daman, defeating him and forcing him to flee to Gaochang. Emperor Yang then sent Pei to Gaochang to persuade Ashina Daman to come to Sui, and Ashina Daman did; he subsequently stayed in China and did not return to his own land. Emperor Yang, pleased with this development, awarded Pei with a sable coat and jewels that Ashina Daman offered as tribute. Meanwhile, another strategy offered by Pei to keep the Eastern Turks divided and controlled backfired. Pei had become apprehensive that Ashina Rangan's son and successor the Shibi Khan was becoming strong and difficult to control and had therefore suggested that Emperor Yang offer to marry a princess to the khan's brother Ashina Chiji (ÈòøÂè≤ÈÇ£Âè±Âêâ). Ashina Chiji, in fear, declined. This already brought resentment from the khan, when Pei tricked the Shibi Khan's strategist Shishuhu (Âè≤ËúÄËÉ°) into meeting him at Mayi (present-day Shuozhou, Shanxi) and then killed him, claiming that Shishuhu was planning to rebel against the khan. Shibi Khan, knowing that the accusation was false, became resolved to rebel against Sui. In the fall of 615, when Emperor Yang was visiting Yanmen Commandery on the northern frontier, the khan launched a surprise attack on the area, overrunning most of its Chinese settlements. Warned by the khan's wife Princess Yicheng‚Äîa member of the imperial family who had been well treated by Empress Xiao during an earlier visit‚Äîthe emperor, empress, and their entourage escaped to the commandery seat at present-day Daixian.. The Turks besieged them there on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. Emperor Yang put Yu and Pei in charge of planning the military counteroffensive, but was only able to get the siege lifted after he followed the advice of the empress's brother Xiao Yu and sent messengers to Princess Yicheng, who was directing military affairs at the Turkish capital in her husband's absence. She falsely informed Shibi Khan that the Turks were under attack from the north, and so the khan lifted the siege. After the end of the siege, Pei accompanied Emperor Yang back to Luoyang, and was subsequently in charge of receiving a delegation led by Ashina Shekui's son. In 616, Emperor Yang, despite the fact that most of his territory was engulfed by agrarian rebellions, went from Luoyang to Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). Pei accompanied him, but when Pei subsequently warned him about agrarian rebellions‚Äîwhich he did not wish to hear about‚Äîhe ordered Pei back to Chang'an to be in charge of again receiving Xiyu emissaries, an effective banishment, although he did not push the issue when Pei subsequently claimed illness. In 617, when news that the general Li Yuan had rebelled at Taiyuan (Â§™Âéü, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) and was attacking Chang'an, having defeated and captured the major general Qutu Tong (Â±àÁ™ÅÈÄö), Emperor Yang was alarmed, and Pei suggested returning to Luoyang. Emperor Yang, while not listening to Pei, restored him to his posts. Pei, seeing that Emperor Yang's elite Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú), which Emperor Yang had taken to Jiangdu with him, had its soldiers deserting due to their missing their northern homes, treated the Xiaoguo officers with respect while suggesting that the soldiers be given wives in Jiangdu. Emperor Yang agreed, and Xiaoguo soldiers were given wives (and permitted to marry those with whom they had previously had secret liaisons). In spring 618, Xiaoguo officers nevertheless rose in a coup, led by Yuwen Huaji (Yuwen Shu's son). They killed Emperor Yang and a large number of high-level officials, but as Pei was kind to them, they spared Pei. Yuwen Huaji declared Emperor Yang's nephew Yang Hao the Prince of Qin emperor, and began to head back north with the Xiaoguo Army.  Under Yuwen Huaji and Dou Jiande  Yuwen Huaji made Pei Ju the co-head (ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ, Pushe) of the executive bureau of the government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). After he poisoned Yang Hao and declared himself emperor of a state of Xu (Ë®±) later in 618, he created Pei the Duke of Cai. He was subsequently captured and executed by another rebel ruler, Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia, in 619. Dou, as his government was then unorganized, had Pei draft the governmental organization and continue to serve as Pushe in his government, often inquiring Pei as to Sui governance and other related matters. In 621, with Li Shimin (a son of Li Yuan, who had in 618 established Tang Dynasty as its Emperor Gaozu) attacking Wang Shichong the Emperor of Zheng, Dou, believing that if Tang destroyed Zheng, his own Xia state would be cornered, went to Wang's aid, but was defeated by Li Shimin at the Battle of Hulao and captured. His wife Empress Cao and a number of generals fled back to the Xia capital Ming Prefecture (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei) and considered supporting an adoptive son of Dou Jiande as Prince of Xia and continuing to resist Tang, but at the urging of the official Qi Shanxing (ÈΩäÂñÑË°å), Xia forces were disbanded. Qi, Pei, and Empress Cao's brother Cao Dan (ÊõπÊó¶) then escorted her and surrendered to Tang.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Emperor Gaozu created Pei Ju the Duke of Anyi and had him serve as the head of his son and crown prince Li Jiancheng's household. He also had Pei and Yu Shinan (Yu Shiji's brother) draft regulations on various ceremonies, and the regulations were described as appropriate and praised by scholars. In 624, he was made acting Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠) -- the head of the examination bureau of the government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. In 625, Western Tujue's Yehu Khan Ashina Tong requested a marriage with a Tang princess. Emperor Gaozu consulted Pei, who believed that such a marriage would be beneficial to Tang, and Emperor Gaozu therefore agreed. (However, Ashina Tong, fearful of anger of Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi, did not actually carry out the marriage.) Later in 625, Pei was no longer Shizhong and therefore apparently no longer chancellor. In 626, Li Shimin the Prince of Qin, then in an intense rivalry with Li Jiancheng and fearing that Li Jiancheng would kill him, ambushed Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Xuanwu Gate and killed them. After Li Jiancheng's and Li Yuanji's deaths, their troops nevertheless continued to battle Li Shimin's, and Li Shimin asked Pei to appear before them and encourage them to disband, which they did.The Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang both indicated that it was Li Shimin who requested Pei to do this. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 63, and New Book of Tang, vol. 100, but the Zizhi Tongjian indicated that it was Emperor Gaozu who did so. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 191. When Li Shimin then effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince and then reorganized the government, Pei was made the minister of census.  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Pei Ju continued to serve as minister of census after Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin in winter 626 (as Emperor Taizong). Also in winter 626, Pei suggested that a small amount of silk be distributed per household for the people who had been adversely affected by Tujue incursions‚Äîa suggestion that Emperor Taizong rejected as impractical, pointing out that households had various sizes, instead ordering that the silk be distributed by household size. However, later that year, Pei received approval from Emperor Taizong, when he counseled Emperor Taizong not to execute a low level official who had received a bribe in a sting operation‚Äîpointing out the inequity in executing someone for falling trap to a sting operation. Pei died in 627 and was posthumously honored.

Tsawwassen First Nation lists its membership at approximately 490 people, about half of whom live on the reserve. History The oldest finds in the area of Tsawwassen First Nation settled by means of radiocarbon dated to about 2260 BC. Other sites such as Whalen Farm and Beach Grove dating back to the presence of Tsawwassen at least until the time of 400-200 BC. The traditional Tsawwassen area ranged in the north east to the area around Pitt Lake, Pitt River to Pitt Meadows down to where the water in the Fraser River flows. It included Burns Bog and parts of New Westminster. From Sea Island to Galiano Island and joined Salt Spring, Pender and Saturna Island. North Eastwards came the Point Roberts Peninsula added, then the area around the Serpentine and Nicomekl River. Like most First Nations people of the West Coast the Tsawwassen lived in family groups and inhabited longhouses. They carved no totem poles but ornate house posts, masks, tools with carvings etc. Also they processed cedar fibers and goat hair into dresses and headgear. Also, the wooden building material, firewood, canoes and dresses. Using tidal traps, fishing, nets and harpoons they hunted fish, especially salmon. They also harvested oysters, crabs and other sea creatures. The salmon was considered a supernatural being, and therefore had to be hunted and eaten in a very particular way. The remains were returned to the sea in a private ceremony. Numerous species of birds were on the menu, such as ducks, loons, to seals and sea lions. Land mammals such as moose, deer, black bear and beaver were hunted seasonally. Also Camassia, Cranberries and medicinal plants were harvested, also traded and exchanged. Reserves, loss of land In 1851, the last frontier settlements in the wake of the border treaty of 1846 between the United States and Great Britain took place. A portion of the Tsawwassen Territory was now in Point Roberts in the U.S. state of Washington. In 1858 the first cross-country road was built in British Columbia from Tsawwassen Beach to Fort Langley. In 1859, it was followed by the first inner-city street the \\"North Road\\" between Burnaby and Coquitlam. In 1871, a tiny reserve was assigned to the Tsawwassen peoples, which was enlarged in 1874 to 490 acres. Today, it covers 717 acres or 290 hectares. In 1914, chief Harry Joe sent a petition to the McKenna McBride Commission, with a request for review of reservations. The petition was dismissed. Nevertheless, young Tsawwassen First Nation peoples joined the Canadian Military in the First and Second World Wars. In 1958, the B.C. provincial government built the BC Ferries terminal in Tsawwassen for their ferries. For this purpose, a Tsawwassen First Nation long house was demolished. When the terminal was enlarged in 1973, 1976, and 1991, there were no consultations with the Tsawwassen peoples. The Tsawwassen First Nation is a member government of the Naut'sa mawt Tribal Council. Treaty and land claims negotiations The Tsawwassen, a Coast Salish people, are one of the few British Columbia First Nations to come to the end of the BC Treaty Process, the others being the Nisga'a, the Temexw Treaty Association and the Lheidl T'enneh First Nation. The treaty deal would have allowed for the expansion of the Roberts Bank Superport and the employment of band members in the expanded facility, but was criticized by some as a sell-out, as the negotiated settlement modified and defined TFN's Aboriginal rights. The Treaty was ratified by Tsawwassen members in July 2007 and expanded the size of the Tsawwassen reserve by 400 hectares, offered a cash settlement of $16 million and $36 million in program funding, re-established TFN's right to self-govern, and reserved a portion of the Fraser River salmon catch to the Tsawwassen. In return, the Tsawwassen would abandon other land claims and would eventually pay taxes. On April 3, 2009, after 14 years of negotiations, the Tsawwassen First Nation implemented the Final Agreement and became self-governing. In 2009, the first election of the new Legislature was called as the existing Indian Act was replaced. Tsawwassen First Nation then also became the first First Nation to become a full member of the Metro Vancouver regional district (now Metro Vancouver). In January 2012, a \\"mega-mall\\" project was approved by the Tsawwassen First Nation, with 43 percent of the eligible voters taking part. Of that 43 percent who voted, 97 percent were in favor of the project. The mall is expected to create jobs and stimulate tourism for the community. The resulting Tsawwassen Mills mall, built by Ivanho√© Cambridge, opened on October 5, 2016.

He is best known for building the Pioneer Paper Mill, the first paper mill in California. Taylor sailed from Boston Harbor in a schooner that he purchased with a group of friends, arriving in San Francisco ten months later. Taylor's first business in California was a bacon and egg stand on the beach. \\"Upon arrival Taylor found a wooden cask of eggs floating near the shore. He cooked the eggs, overturned the cask, and set up a food stand on the beach.\\" In 1853, Taylor left for Hawkins Bar, California in Tuolumne County to prospect for gold. He used his profits to buy land in Marin County and enter the paper business. Samuel Taylor was ahead of his time in producing recycled paper products from rags and old papers that his employees collected from various California cities and in creating the first fish ladder on the West Coast to help fish swim upstream around the dam near his paper mill. Taylor married Sarah Washington Irving, raised a family of seven boys and one girl, and served on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Working with other concerned citizens, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor helped stop the importation of Chinese slave girls into San Francisco. After Samuel Taylor's death in 1886, his wife lost the paper mill and land around it in the Panic of 1893. The new owners of the Taylors' land (who refused to allow Sarah Taylor to be buried next to her husband on the family plot) lost the property themselves when it was taken by the State of California in 1945 for non- payment of taxes. The state then created Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Taylor is buried on a hill overlooking the former site of the mill. His gravesite was restored in 1997 by Freemasons of San Francisco Oriental Lodge No. 144. Sarah Washington Irving now lies next to her husband on the southwest slope of Barnabe Mountain (near ). Genealogy It has been claimed that Taylor was the grandson of George Taylor, a Pennsylvanian who signed the Declaration of Independence, and that Sarah Washington Irving was the favorite niece of writer and poet Washington Irving. In 2010, however, Judy Coy and George Stevens disputed these claims, providing evidence that Samuel Taylor's grandfather was Captain George Taylor Sr. of Catskill, Greene County, New York. Captain George Taylor Sr. was born August 15, 1756 in Glastonbury, Connecticut, the son of John and Mary Taylor, and died in New York City on July 4, 1831. Coy and Stevens further maintain that Sarah Washington Irving Taylor's parents were James W. Irving and Mary Doak of Providence, Rhode Island and later of Fall River, Massachusetts (1850 census of Fall River). There were many Sarahs in Washington Irving's family. His niece Sarah who lived with Irving until his death never married according to officials at his Sunnyside residence. There is no record that Samuel P. Taylor ever claimed to be the grandson of the signer of the Declaration of Independence, nor that Sarah Washington Irving Taylor claimed to be the niece of Washington Irving. The earliest known written record of the claim is in Pioneering in Marin County, A Historical Recording by Bertha Stedman Rothwell, dated June 1959.

Premiership season In 1931, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 7.

Melbourne 8.13 (61) defeated 8.5 (53) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the firsts Grand Final on 10 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * The VFL changed its Brownlow Medal voting procedure. The field umpire now voted for the three \\"fairest and best\\" on the ground in each match, casting 3, 2, and 1 votes. If there was a tie, the player with the most \\"3\\" votes would be declared the winner. * The VFL altered the manner in which it determined its premiership team. Abandoning the \\"amended Argus system\\" that had operated from 1902 to 1930 (except in 1924), the VFL instituted the Page‚ÄìMcIntyre system which, amongst other innovations, guaranteed that there would be a \\"Grand Final\\" at the end of every season (this system continued to operate until 1972). *Prior to the season, the VFL and the Grounds Management Association (which represented the operators of most of the VFL grounds) entered a dispute over the use of the grounds for football matches. The dispute covered financial arrangements and the demarcation between the football and cricket seasons. After arbitration from the Minister for Lands, it was agreed that cricket clubs would be required to pay the league ¬£20 per 100 members, ending the long-standing practice of cricket club members receiving admission to football games without compensation to the football clubs; but that the grounds management would still retain all receipts for admission to reserve areas, with the league receiving none of these takings. During the stand-off, the VFL arranged for the Motordrome and the Exhibition Oval to be available to serve as alternative venues during the year, and drew up a fixture which saw each of those grounds holding twelve games ‚Äì with Fitzroy, Carlton, North Melbourne, St Kilda, Collingwood and Essendon each playing four of their nine home games at one the replacement grounds. * In round 2, Richmond set the record for highest score in a game, scoring 30.19.199 against . This beat South Melbourne's 1919 record by ten points, and remained unbeaten until 1969. * In round 12, Carlton rover Tommy Downs was reported for kicking Richmond captain Maurie Hunter; despite the efforts of future Australian Prime Minister R. G. Menzies, K.C., Downs was suspended for the remainder of the 1931 season and the whole of the 1932 season. * In the first Semi-Final, Carlton thrashed Collingwood 20.10 (130) to 5.12 (42). Harry \\"Soapy\\" Vallence, at full-forward for Carlton kicked a (Finals) record 11 goals, including six in the last quarter. Vallance would have had 12 goals if his last shot (the last kick in the match) had not hit the goal-post, and only counted as a \\"behind\\". * The Round 17 match between St Kilda and Collingwood was the first where both sides scored twenty goals. Both Bill Mohr and Gordon Coventry kicked eleven goals. Coventry was the first to kick ten for a losing side.

Temple in the Sea Indian Caribbean Museum of Trinidad and Tobago Carapichaima is a town in central Trinidad, Trinidad and Tobago. Communities and villages in Carapichaima include Orangefield, Waterloo, Brickfield, and Korea Village. Name The name Carapichaima is said to be derived from the native Amerindian inhabitants who no longer exist in this area. History Carapichaima had been a sugar producing village that expanded after the railroad opened up central Trinidad to development and population movements. Better access to transportation allowed the village to expand into a hub for transportation in central Trinidad and center for commerce for the surrounding areas and rural communities. Carapichaima has seen major changes and growth due to a number of factors. These include the construction of new schools in the area, the establishment and expansion of business into the area and the increase in tourism into the area. Major structural changes occurred in the past few years when the main sugar producing, state owned company, Caroni 1975 Ltd., was closed in 2003.http://www.guardian.co.tt/news/2012-07-19/end-era A significant part of the rural population were employed in the sugar industry. Among some of the major problems plaguing this community is increasing crime rates and difficulty coping with the previously mentioned structural changes.  Religion  Dattatreya Mandir The town is very culturally diverse hosting a very large East Indian population as well as a significant African population. The predominantly East Indian population explains the dominance of religions like Hinduism and Islam in the area. This dominance is evident by the amount of Temples and Mosques located in the area. The Dattatreya Mandir is a Hindu temple dedicated to Ganapathi Sachchidananda. Situated on the temple ground is the tallest (85 feet) Lord Hanuman statue in the Western Hemisphere completed in 2001. The statue was designed and constructed by T. Subramanian Sthapathi (Chief Architect) from Chennai.Potomitan.info: Trinidad's Giant Hanuman Also of significance is the temple in Waterloo, which extends into the sea. Several Mosques dot the area and a Muslim school is centrally located close to the former train station. A number of churches also exist to serve the growing Christian population in Carapichaima. Carapichaima has been a major staging point for Carnival celebrations in Central Trinidad. Schools A number of schools have sprouted in the area to accommodate its rising population. One of the first was the Canadian Missionary school, the Waterloo Presbyterian School. This was originally built to educate the rural East Indians who lived and formed the workforce of the sugar plantations that encompassed the region at that time. Eventually a number of schools were established like the Waterloo Hindu School, Orange Field Hindu School, Carapichaima RC School and the Carapichaima ASJA Muslim Primary School to name a few.

It represents a significant aspect of Field's very limited dramatic output. Though hard evidence is lacking, the play is thought to have been composed c. 1619; it may have been the last writing for the theatre done by Field before his death in 1620. The play was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. The 1632 quarto was printed by John Norton for the bookseller Francis Constable. The quarto's text is corrupt and badly printed. Synopsis The play is set in Dijon in Burgundy in the later part of the fifteenth century, in the aftermath of the battles of Grandson, Morat (both 1476) and Nancy (1477), all mentioned in Act I, scene ii. The protagonist's father, the elder Charalois, was a general who had gone into debt to pay the expenses of his troops; unable to repay those charges, he died in debtor's prison, and his rapacious creditors refuse to release his body for a proper burial. The general's son has taken his cause to court, but his suit is rejected by the judges, led by the hostile Novall Senior, president of the Dijon parlement. The younger Charalois amazes everyone by offering to assume his father's debts and take his place in prison, thus freeing his father's corpse. A retiring judge named Rochfort is impressed by Charalois' courage, virtue, and self-sacrifice, and decides to pay the general's debts himself. Rochfort has an only daughter named Beaumelle; she is the centre of a set of fashionable and foppish young people, featuring the aristocratic Novall Junior and his hangers-on. Beaumelle's waiting-woman, Bellapert, is a cynical sensualist who tempts her mistress with the idea of marrying to enjoy sexual indulgence with many illicit lovers. Beaumelle's father is so taken with Charalois that he arranges a marriage between the young man and his daughter. Novall Junior is irate about the marriage, since he has lost his chance of taking Beaumelle's virginity; but Bellapert assures him that the marriage will work to his advantage. Others, including Charalois' friend Romont, perceive the growing intimacy of Novall Junior and Beaumelle, and try to warn the parties involved ‚Äî without success. Eventually, Beaumelle consummates her incipient affair with Novall Junior. Charalois walks in upon them, catching them in the act. Charalois challenges Novall Junior; Novall attempts to avoid the duel, but in the end he fights with Charalois, and is killed. Charalois stages a mock trial, with his father-in-law Rochfort as the judge.This powerful scene appears to have been suggested by a scene in an earlier play, Robert Daborne's The Poor Man's Comfort of c. 1617. Rochfort, even in his emotional turmoil, hears Charalois' accusation and Beaumelle's confession, and sentences her to death. Charalois stabs her; Beaumelle dies. Novall Senior discovers his son's death, and has Charalois arrested and prosecuted. Charalois defends himself before the court, and wins an acquittal. One of Novall Junior's followers, however, is an ex-soldier named Pontalier who was redeemed from debtor's prison by the judge's son; repaying that favour, Pontalier stabs and kills Charalois in the court, and in turn is stabbed and killed by Romont. Authorship and reception Scholars have estimated that the play is 60% Massinger's work, and 40% Field's.Logan and Smith, p. 107. Field's hand is most prominent in Act II, in the second half of Act III, and in Act IV scene 1.Sykes, p. 201. The two collaborators divided the task according to their artistic strengths: Field wrote the portions of the play that deal with the fashionable world of Beaumelle and Novall Junior, while Massinger handled the parts involving soldiers, the law court, and the serious moral issues of the drama. The play has been called \\"unique among the plays of the Massinger canon in being both weak in plot and unusually strong in characterization.\\"T. A. Dunn, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 98. The play has been praised by critics; Arthur Symons considered it one of Massinger's \\"two most distinct and most distinguished tragedies\\" (the other being The Duke of Milan).Symons, p. 114. Adaptations In 1702, Nicholas Rowe adapted The Fatal Dowry into a new version he titled The Fair Penitent. Aaron Hill also reworked Massinger and Field's play into his own version, The Insolvent (written c. 1732; published 1758). In both adapted and original forms, the play had success in revivals over a long period. Rowe's version was enormously popular in its era; an adaptation by Richard Lalor Sheil, starring Charles Macready, was done at Drury Lane and in Bath in 1825,Phelan, p. 59. and the original was performed at Sadler's Wells in 1845. Richard Beer-Hofmann's German-language play Der Graf von Charolais (1904) was based on The Fatal Dowry. T. A. Dunn produced a modern edition of the play in 1969.

The village is famous for the Our Lady of Snow church located at the heart of the Terku (South) Kallikulam.  History  The history of South Kallikulam extends up to the early 18th century. It is believed that the first inhabitants of Kallikulam had migrated from some southern part to the current village location. It was an unoccupied arid land till the first occupants moved here to start a living by farming. They built a temple for Sudalai Madan, a Hindu deity worshiped in the Tamil Nadu. There were a lot of disputes over the ownership of the land of the village. Over the time of period new families started to move here from surrounding places. In 1770, a thatched church was built in the name of Holy Mary by the village people with the help from the priest from Vadakkankulam, a town located about 15 km south to Kallikulam. During 1885, snowfall occurred in the centre of the village and people believed that it was because of Holy Mary. Subsequently, the church was built up as a permanent structure with very good design during 1885 after the great miracle.  Geography  South Kallikulam is located at which is very southern part of the South India peninsula. It is located about 6 km east to Valliyur on the route to Tiruchendur in Indian state highway (SH) - 93. The nearest pivotal towns are: Valliyur to the west, Thisayanvilai to the east, Tiruchendur to the northeast, Nagercoil to the southwest.Administrative Setup of Tirunelveli District  Religion  South Kallikulam has a rich heritage of a diverse group of religions. Though it doesn't have a large crowd of people in the village there are people who practice the major religions of India: Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Even though it has different religion practitioners, practitioners of Roman Catholic is predominant in Kallikulam. It has four Roman Catholic churches, a mosque and a couple of Hindu temples too. Each church has different patron saints in which Our Lady of Snows church located in the center of the village is very famous around the place for its significant history behind.  Our Lady of Snows Church  The Church of Our Lady of Snow is a Roman Catholic Marian church in Kallikulam, Tirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the Catholic pilgrimage centers in India dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary. This Church has tallest tower among Churches in India with very good engineering structure. this church is maintained by Nadar community of Kalli Kulam. In recent times it became popular because of vision and apparition of Mother Mary. Locally, Our Lady of Snow is known as Panimatha (Tamil: ‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Æø‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Ææ). Panimatha is a Tamil word. In Tamil 'Pani (‡Æ™‡Æ©‡Æø)' means 'Snow' and 'Matha (‡ÆÆ‡Ææ‡Æ§‡Ææ)' means 'Mother'. Every year, the annual feast of Our Lady of Snow is celebrated from 27 July to 5 August. The feast starts with a flag hoisting ceremony on 27 July in the evening. But surprisingly, along with Christians also other people worship in this church. A flag with Our Lady of Snow's image is raised up the flagpole (Tamil: ‡Æï‡Øä‡Æü‡Æø‡ÆÆ‡Æ∞‡ÆÆ‡Øç) situated just opposite to the church. On the 7th day of the feast, in the morning, a special mass is conducted on the Apparition Hill. On the 9th day, at night, a car procession is conducted. Three very large cars participate in the procession. Our Lady of Snow's statue is placed in a Car and taken through the village streets. On the 10th day of the feast, at 6.00 am, the car procession comes to an end and the cars are parked near the church for worship. Then a celebratory mass honoring Our Lady of Snow is conducted. The feast comes to end with the evening novena on the 10th day. A number of miracles occurred in this Church. If we pray Our Lady of Snow with faith, we could get good health, wealth and peace.

It airs a news/talk radio format, simulcast with sister station 105.9 KMJ-FM. Owned by Cumulus Media, the studios and offices are located at the Radio City building on Shaw Avenue in North Fresno. The transmitter is in Orange Cove, California, on East American Avenue at Cove Road.Radio-Locator.com/KMJ-AM While AM 580 is a Regional broadcast frequency, the station is powered at 50,000 watts, the highest power for an AM station permitted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). To protect other stations on AM 580, KMJ uses a four-tower array directional antenna. The signal covers most of Central California and reaches into the Bay Area, Sacramento and Bakersfield. KMJ is Central California's primary entry point station in the Emergency Alert System. Programming KMJ-AM-FM focus primarily on locally produced talk programming and news on weekdays. Mornings begin with an agricultural news hour, followed by \\"Fresno's Morning News,\\" a three-hour block of news, sports, traffic and weather. Middays and afternoons feature local talk hosts. Several nationally syndicated programs are carried at night, including Mark Levin, Armstrong & Getty, Red Eye Radio and America in The Morning from Westwood One, a subsidiary of Cumulus Media, the parent company of KMJ-AM-FM. Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, auto repair and dining. Some shows are paid brokered programming. Weekend hosts include Chris Plante, Chad Benson and Ric Edelman. Local newscasters are heard at the beginning of most hours, with Westwood One News carried at night. History =Early Years= KMJ first signed on in March 1922, and was originally owned by the San Joaquin Light and Power Corporation. It was later acquired by the McClatchy Newspaper Company in 1925, which also published the daily newspaper The Fresno Bee.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 22 KMJ is the 38th oldest licensed, and continuously operated radio station in the United States. It remains one of only a few dozen stations to keep their original three-letter call sign from their founding. When the station first began broadcasting, it was licensed as an \\"E & M\\" station, and shared those frequencies with every other E & M station in existence at the time. KMJ operated on a number of other frequencies between 1925 and 1932. Some of the frequencies used included 820 and 1350 kilocycles. In 1931, KMJ operated on 1210 kHz, with a power of 100 watts (cf. White's Radio Log, Spring / Summer 1931). In 1935, KMJ was on the current frequency of 580 kHz, with a power of 500 watts (cf. White's Radio Log, Nov. 1935). =Signal Upgrade= McClatchy was intent on improving the signal, and competed with KTAB in Oakland (now KSFO San Francisco) for the 580 frequency, which was being made available by the newly created Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Until 1936, and the arrival of KARM, KMJ was the only radio station in Fresno. Eventually, McClatchy was awarded the new channel, and KMJ moved to 580 kHz, effective July 22, 1932, with an increase in power from 100 watts to 500 watts with unlimited time. Later, power was boosted to 1,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna from a building rooftop in Downtown Fresno. =Network Affiliation= The station was an affiliate of the Don Lee Network, and also carried CBS Radio Network broadcasts until 1936, when KMJ switched its affiliation to the NBC Red Network. It remained an NBC affiliate until NBC ceased hourly newscasts in the 1990s. KMJ then joined ABC. When CBS was acquired by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (later be renamed CBS Corporation), CBS Radio acquired KMJ from American Radio Systems in 1998. It then began carrying CBS News at the beginning of most hours. \\"Modern\\" studios were constructed as an addition to the Fresno Bee Building on Van Ness Avenue. The studios were subsequently used by Valley Public Radio, and later, McClatchy donated the entire building to the Fresno Metropolitan Museum. The radio studio addition was demolished in 2007, as part of a renovation of the main building. At the outset of World War II, the Department of War selected KMJ as the primary medium for alerting Central California residents. It is still used for this purpose today as a primary entry point for the Emergency Alert System. From 1925 until 1987, KMJ was owned by McClatchy, which also owned KFBK in Sacramento, KBEE in Modesto, KERN in Bakersfield, and KKOH (formerly KOH) in Reno. McClatchy Newspapers also owned three daily newspapers in Fresno, Sacramento, and Modesto. =FM and TV Stations= In 1949, KMJ gained a sister station with KMJ-FM 97.9 MHz going on the air. At first, it simulcast 580 KMJ. It later played classical music and then switched to an automated Top 40 sound in the 1970s. Today it is KMGV. In 1953, a television station was added, KMJ-TV on Channel 24. Because KMJ Radio was a longtime NBC affiliate, Channel 24 carried NBC Television Network programming. The TV station was sold off in 1981 to become KSEE. In November 2006, KMJ and its sister stations KFPT AM 790, KWYE FM 101.1, KSKS FM 93.7, KFJK FM 105.9, KOQO FM 101.9 and KMGV FM 97.9 were sold by CBS Radio to Peak Broadcasting for $90 million. =Adding KMJ-FM= In March 2009, as more listeners were tuning to FM radio, Peak Broadcasting decided to put KMJ on the FM band. It replaced the KFJK Jack FM format on 105.9 FM, with Talk programming as KMJ-FM. At first, only some programs were shared by both KMJ-AM and FM. But now, all programming is simulcast. In the fall of 2012, Premiere Radio Networks, owned by Clear Channel Radio, exercised a termination clause and ended its relationship with KMJ-AM-FM. As of January 1, 2013, all Premiere syndicated shows, including Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, were moved to Clear Channel-controlled stations in the greater Fresno area. KMJ-AM-FM used the opportunity to go with an all live and local line-up of shows from 5 A.M. until 6 P.M., Monday through Friday. =Ownership Changes= On August 30, 2013, a deal was announced in which Townsquare Media would purchase Peak Broadcasting, and then immediately swap Peak's Fresno stations, including KMJ, to Cumulus Media in exchange for Cumulus' stations in Dubuque, Iowa and Poughkeepsie, New York. The deal was part of Cumulus' acquisition of Dial Global. Peak, Townsquare, and Dial Global are all controlled by Oaktree Capital Management. The sale to Cumulus was completed on November 14, 2013. Under Cumulus ownership, KMJ-AM-FM became affiliates of co-owned Westwood One News. Transmitter In 1936, the station constructed a 5,000-watt non-directional transmitter site which utilized a 5/8 wave antenna located 5 miles east of Fresno at the northeast corner of the Kings Canyon Road and Fowler Avenue intersection. In 1941, Hammer Field (which later became Fresno Air Terminal) was constructed, as a training base for the Army Air Corps. The KMJ tower was directly in line with the runway, and the Army wanted the site relocated. The transmitter was then moved some 16 miles west of Fresno, to the intersection of Madera and North Avenues in Kerman. The transmitter building was moved to the Kerman site, and the existing tower was unstacked and moved as well; however, it was only 660 feet in height. The remaining 330 feet were stored on the site, with the intention of creating a directional array, although World War II interrupted the project and it never resumed. The extra portion was eventually moved to Sacramento, and used in the construction of the KFBK transmitter site in 1945. Later, a new directional array was built in Orange Cove, California. However the station retained the single-tower Kerman site. As of 2019 it is not registered as an auxiliary transmit location, so the station must file for an STA if it wishes to transmit from the old tower.https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/amq?list=0&facid;=26923 This most recently occurred in September 2013 when a Special Temporary Authority (STA) was granted by the FCC that authorized KMJ to use the auxiliary site in Kerman at 5,000 watts, while one of its directional antennas at the 50,000 watt site in Orange Cove underwent repairs. KMJ uses a 50,000 watt transmitter into a directional antenna consisting of 4 mast radiators situated at 36-39-37.2 N 119-20-52.8 W, 36-39-29.2 N 119-20-52.8 W, 36-39-27.9 N 119-20-48.3 W, 36-39-36.5 N 119-20-47.1 W; each of the towers is tall. Due to its location near the bottom of the AM dial, KMJ's daytime signal decently covers much of the Central Valley, as far north as Sacramento and as far south as Bakersfield. Much of the San Francisco Bay Area gets a city-grade signal.

A gifted sketch artist and watercolorist, he was one of the group of young Art Students League humorists who called themselves the Fakirs. Life and work Edward Leigh Chase was born in Elkhart Lake, Sheboygan County, Wisconsin, the third child of Grace (n√©e Metcalfe) and chemist Charles Denison Chase. His family moved to St Louis, Missouri, in 1885, when he was an infant, and he grew up attending public schools there. Shunning regular college, he traveled to New York City to study art at the Art Students League. Among his professors there was the painter William Merritt Chase. Edward Leigh Chase ‚Äì ‚ÄúNed‚Äù to those who knew him ‚Äì showed particular promise in his use of pen and ink, and he soon turned his talent and wit to humor. For fun and valuable practice, a group of irreverent pupils at the League in Manhattan created parody illustrations mocking serious works of leading artists, among them their own professors, William Merritt Chase included. The students who participated in such lampooning called themselves the Society of American Fakirs, word play on the fact that the faux masterpieces they produced were fakes. The name implied as well that they fancied themselves magicians of a sort. With a wave of a pen or paintbrush, they could transform \\"legitimate\\" art into laughing stock. Among the Fakirs were Georgia O'Keeffe, James Montgomery Flagg, Man Ray, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and Ned Chase‚Äôs younger brother, Frank Swift Chase. Graduating from the Art Students League, the Chase brothers headed upstate to the Catskill Mountains to join in an experimental Bohemian commune of a style, organized by Ralph Whitehead in Woodstock, New York. Building their own clapboard studios in the woods outside the village proper, they studied and worked together in what they saw as an artists‚Äô utopia, named Byrdcliffe. Ned Chase honed his skills in sketching and watercolor, and emerged a successful illustrator, albeit not of the caliber of his brother, Frank, who became a landscape painter of national renown. Later in life, Ned Chase painted fine equestrian portraiture of a classical style which he might have roundly excoriated as a \\"Fakir\\" in his youth. Edward Leigh Chase died in Woodstock in 1965, and is buried with other family members in the Artists' Cemetery there. He was married to Mabel Penrose (Tinsley), the daughter of Edward Tinsley and Laura Penrose Thornton. His grandson is the actor, writer, and comedian Chevy Chase.

Biography He was born at Montrose, Pennsylvania, son of the jurist William Jessup (1797‚Äì1868). He was the grandfather of noted international jurist and diplomat Philip Jessup. He enrolled at Cortland Academy in Homer, New York for one year before attending Yale University. He graduated from Yale in 1851 and from Union Theological Seminary in 1855 at which point he was officially ordained; he immediately entered the foreign-missionary service of the Presbyterian church.* He spent his first four years of service in Tripoli, Lebanon, devoting much time to leaning Arabic at which he proved extremely deft. He married Caroline Bush during one trip back to America in 1857 and returned to Tripoli within a matter of months. During the Druse Revolts, the Jessups moved to Beirut and had three children. His wife took ill on sea voyage prescribed by a doctor and she died in Alexandria, Egypt. Jessup remarried in 1869 to Harriet Elizabeth Dodge with whom he had five children, though she too died in 1882. During one of his few trips back to America in 1884, Jessup married for the third and last time to Theodosia Davenport Lockwood. Jessup served as the acting pastor for the Syrian Church of Beirut and superintendent of its school for thirty years, teaching almost any grade. He also became the first secretary of the Asfuriyeh Hosipital for the Insane, acted for a time as missionary editor for the Arabic journal El-Neshrah. Serving and teaching in Beirut tirelessly, he refused a professorship at Union Seminary in 1857, a position as secretary of the Presbyterian Board in 1870, and the post of United States minister to Persia in 1883. Jessup also authored numerous books about Syrian history, which culminated in the work for which he is best known, Fifty-Three Years in Syria published in 1910, a two volume memoir and historical account of his life there. He died and was buried in Beirut. Ted Jessup, the American Television writer and producer is a great great grandson of Reverend Jessup. Writings He wrote, besides various works for the American Press at Beirut: * The Women of the Arabs (1873) - * Syrian Home Life (1874) - * The Mohammedan Missionary Problem (1879) - * The Greek Church and Protestant Missions (1884) * The Setting of the Crescent and the Rising of the Cross (1898) - * Kamil, a Moslem Convert (1899) * Fifty-Three Years in Syria (1910) - Volume 1 , Volume 2 =Relating to the Bah√°'√≠ Faith= Jessup may have first encountered the religion following the petition sent by Persian Bah√°'√≠s to the attention of the American government in 1867. Jessup presented about the Bah√°¬¥√≠ Faith twice. The first was during the 1893 World Parliament of religions, which Baha'is consider to be the first public mention of the Baha'i Faith in North America, and the first public quoting on that continent of the words of Bah√°'u'll√°h, the Founder of the Baha'i Faith. Later Jessup also published in the Missionary Review. * References External links * * Category:1832 births Category:1910 deaths Category:People from Montrose, Pennsylvania Category:Presbyterian Church in the United States of America ministers Category:American Presbyterian missionaries Category:Presbyterian missionaries in Syria Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Iran Category:American religious writers Category:American University of Beirut Category:Yale University alumni Category:American expatriates in the Ottoman Empire Category:Presbyterian missionaries in Lebanon ","title":"Henry Harris Jessup"},{"id":"10790194","text":"The Nanoose First Nation, also known the Snaw-naw-as First Nation, is a First Nations government located on southern Vancouver Island in southwestern British Columbia, Canada, in the vicinity of the community of Nanoose Bay.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1982 through Alternative Tentacles. In comparison to the band's previous material, its experimental nature and melodic leanings confused some of their fans and presaged the creative direction they would take on their second studio album, 1983's Beneath the Shadows. The material from Weathered Statues was later re-released on the compilation albums Thoughts of Yesterday: 1981‚Äì1982 (1987) and T.S.O.L. / Weathered Statues (1997). Background Following the release of their 1981 full-length album Dance with Me through Frontier Records, T.S.O.L. moved to Alternative Tentacles, the label run by Jello Biafra and East Bay Ray of fellow California hardcore band the Dead Kennedys. Weathered Statues was recorded with producer Thom Wilson and released in 1982 as catalog number VIRUS 10.Blush, p. 326. Singer Jack Grisham credited himself as Jack Ladoga on the sleeve, following a tradition of using a different pseudonym on each release both to confuse audiences and to hide his true identity from the police.Blush, p. 94. Drummer Todd Barnes credited himself as Todd Scrivener, deriving the pseudonym from the name of the street he lived on. In comparison to T.S.O.L.'s prior releases, Weathered Statues had melodic leanings that presaged the direction the band would pursue on their 1983 album Beneath the Shadows. Steven Blush, author of American Hardcore: A Tribal History, writes that \\"the experimental nature of Weathered Statues bewildered some fans\\". Greg Prato of Allmusic described the song \\"Thoughts of Yesterday\\" as one of the band's best from their early material, calling it \\"a surprisingly low-key and melodic number, which sticks out like a sore thumb amidst [their] other furious thrashers.\\" \\"Word Is\\" stands out as a reggae-influenced track. Re- releases T.S.O.L. had released their eponymously titled debut EP through Posh Boy Records in 1981, then moved to Frontier Records for their full-length album Dance with Me (1981). This caused a dispute with Posh Boy, who claimed the band had not honored their commitment to record a second EP for the label. Several years later, Posh Boy and the four original members of T.S.O.L. (Grisham and Barnes had left the band in late 1983) worked out a settlement in which the members received back payments of royalties from the label, and Posh Boy purchased the master recordings and publishing rights to Weathered Statues. Posh Boy combined Weathered Statues with the debut EP to make the 1987 compilation album Thoughts of Yesterday: 1981‚Äì1982 (later re-released through Rhino Records). Nitro Records purchased the master tapes from Posh Boy in 1997, remastered them, and re-released the two EPs as the compilation T.S.O.L. / Weathered Statues. Of the Nitro release, Allmusic's Steve Huey remarked that it \\"showcases the group's pulverizing early sound\\".

It is used for acquiring, managing, and reading eBooks, digital newspapers, and other digital publications. The software supports PDF and EPUB (nonproprietary file format for reflowable text or fixed layout ebooks). It implements a proprietary scheme of Digital Rights Management (\\"DRM\\") which, since the version 1.5 release in May 2008, allows document sharing among multiple devices and user authentication via an Adobe ID. ADE is a successor to Adobe eBook Reader. Windows and OS X versions of Adobe Digital Editions were released on June 19, 2007. Previous versions of the software required version 9.0 of Adobe Flash Player. Starting with version 2.0, however, which relies on .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows, Flash Player is no longer supported. Adobe initiated development of a Linux version of ADE in 2007; however, this has not had any beta release or any formal updates. Digital rights management Adobe Digital Editions uses the proprietary ADEPT (Adobe Digital Experience Protection Technology) Digital Rights Management scheme, which is also implemented on some e-book readers, including iPads and many Android devices, but not Kindles. The software locks content to up to six machines and allows the user to view the content on each of them. Barnes & Noble (B&N;) ebooks are protected with a variant of ADEPT. In March 2009, the author of the reverse engineering blog i‚ô•cabbages announced that they had broken the scheme. When viewing an ebook, Adobe Digital Editions by default stores the ebook locally as PDF files on Windows machines. These files can be copied and handled like other files, but they cannot be opened except with Adobe Digital Editions. Adobe's website has virtually no information on ADEPT except on its trademark page and a statement that OverDrive is compatible. Data collection concern On 6 October 2014, Nate Hoffelder reported in The Digital Reader that Adobe Digital Editions version 4 (\\"ADE4\\") was sending extensive information about ebooks back to Adobe, including ebooks read by a user as well as ebooks stored on the same machine but not opened in ADE4. This was confirmed by Sean Gallagher, writing in Ars Technica and by others. However, no one else has confirmed the report that books never opened in ADE nor in the ADE library are logged. Hoffelder reported that the information collected included \\"[which] ebooks that have been opened, which pages were read, and in what order... including the title, publisher, and other metadata for the book\\". He also reported that all this data was sent in clear text‚Äîthat is, not protected by any form of encryption. This would make it easy for a third party to read this information. This data was collected for borrowed library books and for books NOT protected by any form of DRM. Hoffelder suggested that such a practice might violate various privacy laws. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) made a similar suggestion. Adobe responded that their practice was justified by their license agreement and denied collecting data on any book not currently opened for reading. Specifically, they stated: > \\"All information collected from the user is collected solely for purposes > such as license validation and to facilitate the implementation of different > licensing models by publishers. Additionally, this information is solely > collected for the eBook currently being read by the user and not for any > other eBook in the user‚Äôs library or read/available in any other reader. > User privacy is very important to Adobe, and all data collection in Adobe > Digital Editions is in line with the end user license agreement and the > Adobe Privacy Policy.\\" Gary Price, writing in INFOdocket (an online publication sponsored by Library Journal), views the matter as of serious concern, but sees it as another instance of concerns that have been present but largely unaddressed for years. The article also posts Adobe's response to the issue. In October 2014, Adobe released version 4.0.1 of the software, which sends data to Adobe in a secure transmission (using HTTPS).

Duke Professor of Medicine, and executive director of the Duke Center for Personalized Health Care. He served as chancellor for health affairs and dean of the School of Medicine from 1989 to July 2004. Under his leadership, Duke University created the Duke University Health System (DUHS) to develop and operate a comprehensive health delivery system, and he was its founding President and Chief Executive Officer. DUHS, with its practice networks, ambulatory care centers, home health services, community hospitals, university hospital, and satellite collaborations demonstrated the power of academic medicine to deliver the best of care to broad communities. Snyderman helped lead the creation of the Duke Clinical Research Institute, the largest academic clinical research organization worldwide. During his tenure, Duke University Hospital was ranked 6th overall in the nation and its medical school ranked 4th. Snyderman is a leader in the conception and development of personalized health care, an evolving model of national health care delivery. He has articulated the need to move the current focus of health care from the treatment of disease-events to personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory care that is focused on the patient. Ralph Snyderman was the recipient of the 2012 David E. Rogers Award from the Association of American Medical Colleges who recognized him as \\"The Father of Personalized Medicine.\\" He is a member of the Association of American Medical Colleges (chair 2002-2003), Association of American Physicians (President 2003-2004), American Academy of Arts & Sciences, and the National Academy of Medicine.  Early Life and Education  Snyderman was born on March 30, 1940 in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Russian immigrants Morris and Ida Snyderman. A graduate of Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, Snyderman received his MD in 1965 from SUNY Downstate Medical Center. He served his internship and residency in medicine at Duke and later worked as a Public Health Officer doing research in immunology at the NIH.https://nccih.nih.gov/training/videolectures/7/0  Career  Snyderman accepted his first faculty appointment at Duke in 1972 and by 1984, he was the Frederic M. Hanes Professor of Medicine and Immunology and chief of the Division of Rheumatology and Immunology. His research contributed to the understanding of how white blood cells respond to chemical signals to mediate host defense or tissue damage. He is internationally recognized for his contributions in inflammation research. In 1987, Snyderman left Duke to join Genentech, Inc., the pioneering biomedical technology firm, as Senior Vice President for medical research and development. While at Genentech, he led the development and licensing of major biotechnology therapeutics. He returned to Duke in 1989 as Chancellor for Health Affairs, Duke University, a position he held until 2004. Since then, Snyderman established and leads the Duke Center for Personalized Health Care which provides a platform for research directed at developing new models of care.  Research  Snyderman‚Äôs research focused on defining the mechanisms by which leukocytes accumulate at sites of inflammation. He developed the first reliable in vitro technology to quantify leukocyte chemotaxis. His work led to the standard methodology to study this critical component of inflammation. He identified C5a, a cleavage product of the fifth component of complement (C), as a major chemotactic factor which was produced by C activation or by proteolytic cleavage of C5. Snyderman‚Äôs work helped open the field of inflammation research to scientific analysis and lay the foundation of our current understanding of leukocyte activation by chemoattractants and chemokine production by activated mononuclear cells. Snyderman‚Äôs current work is focused on the development and implementation of Personalized Health Care ‚Äì a personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory approach to care. This concept is facilitating the transformation of health care from the current disease-oriented approach to one that focuses on personalized health planning and is increasingly seen as a solution to our national health care dilemma. The Duke Center for Personalized Health Care fosters the adoption of proactive, personalized, and patient-driven care into clinical practice, develops and tests novel clinical approaches to deliver personalized health care and functions as a think tank to foster innovation in health care delivery. The center is currently working on multiple projects to study the feasibility and clinical outcomes of integrating personalized health care into ongoing clinical settings. Snyderman has contributed to over 400 scientific manuscripts.

The Tla'amin, are closely related to the Klahoose and Homalco peoples and have shared their adjoining territories; formerly all three as well as K'omoks were grouped collectively as the Mainland Comox due to their shared language. They have been part of the Coast Salish indigenous peoples of the western coast of Canada since ancient times. The traditional territory of the Sliammon people extends from the vicinity of Stillwater and the northern part of Texada Island, northward along the Malaspina and Gifford Peninsulas to the southern area of Homfray Channel and part of Cortes Island, including also the smaller off-shore islands such as Hernando, Savary and Harwood as well as Powell, Goat and Haslam Lakes. Their ancestral tongue is  îay îa«∞uŒ∏…ôm (Ay-A-Ju-Thum) which is shared with the Klahoose, Homalco & K'omoks peoples. Historically, the Tla'amin, Klahoose and Homalco were all one people with no borders or separation. The three communities shared the village of qÃìaqÃì…õyqÃìay (Grace Harbour) during the winter months and practiced the winter ceremonies that were held by the Coast Salish People. The use of Skway Skway masks, ceremonial songs and dances and potlatching and feasting were common here. Today, Tla'amin's main village lies at tÃìi≈°os…ôm which translates to 'milky waters from herring spawn'. close to 1000 people now reside on Tla'amin lands.

It was first released on June 21, 1995, by Stephen Turner as generic freeware; the license was changed to the GNU General Public License in November 2004. The software can be downloaded for several computing platforms, or the source code can be downloaded and compiled if desired. Analog has support for 35 languages, and provides the ability to do reverse DNS lookups on log files, to indicate where web site hits originate. It can analyze several different types of web server logs, including Apache, IIS, and iPlanet. It has over 200 configuration options and can generate 32 reports. It also supports log files for multiple virtual hosts. The program is comparable to Webalizer or AWStats, though it does not use as many images, preferring to stick with simple bar charts and lists to communicate similar information. Analog can export reports in a number of formats including HTML, XHTML, XML, Latex and a delimited output mode (for example CSV) for importing into other programs. Delimited or \\"computer\\" output from Analog is often used to generate more structured and graphically rich reports using the third party Report Magic program. The popularity of Analog is largely unknown as no download count information has been released on its historic dissemination. In a 1998 survey by the Graphic, Visualization, & Usability Center (GVU), Analog was reportedly used by 24.9% (up from 19.9% the year before), with its nearest rival, Web Trends holding some 20.3% of the market. It is not clear how Analog's usage has changed in the decade leading up to 2010, nor how its usage profile has been impacted by on-line analysis services such as Google Analytics. Analog can operate on an individual or web-farm basis from a single process, requiring no modification of web page or web script code in order to use it. It is a stand-alone utility, and it is not possible for visiting clients to block all of the logging of traffic directly from the client. Analog has not been officially updated since the version 6.0 release in December 2004. The original author moved on to commercial traffic analysis. Updates to Analog continued informally by its user community up until the end of 2009 on the official mailing list. Currently the only formally compiled updated redistributable of Analog is that of Analog CE, which has focused on fixing issues in Analog's XML DTD and on adding new operating system and web browser detection to the original code branch. History Analog was first released in June 1995, as research project by its creator Dr. Stephen Turner, then working as a research fellow in Sidney Sussex College in the University of Cambridge. Some of the larger release milestones include: ;14 June 1995: Analog 0.8b, the initial full testing build. ;29 June 1995: Analog 0.9b was the first public release of Analog. ;12 September 1995: Analog 1.0 was the first stable release. ;10 February 1997: Analog 2.0 was the initial release of a native Win32 version of Analog. ;15 June 1998: Analog 3.0 included support for HTTP/1.1 status codes and included a more refined log parsing engine in addition to the ability to parse non-standard log file formats. ;16 November 1999: Analog 4.0 supported new reports including the Organisation Report, Operating System Report, Search Word Report, Search Query Report and Processing Time Report. ;1 May 2001: Analog 5.0 is released with support for 24 languages, a range of new configuration commands and a new LaTeX output format. ;19 December 2004: Analog 6.0 is released, including support for Palm OS and Symbian OS detection and all other changes from its 21-month beta period.

(True Sounds of Liberty), released in 1983 through Alternative Tentacles. With the addition of keyboardist Greg Kuehn to the lineup, the band moved away from punk rock in favor of a gothic rock sound in the vein of later releases by the Damned and Siouxsie and the Banshees songs, alienating much of their hardcore audience in the process. Though the album was critically well received and led to the band being featured in director Penelope Spheeris' film Suburbia, it was largely rejected by their fanbase within the punk scene. By the end of the year founding members Jack Grisham and Todd Barnes had left the group. They were respectively replaced by singer Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean, with whom T.S.O.L. would continue further from punk rock, eventually becoming a glam rock outfit. The original four members reacquired rights to the name T.S.O.L. in 1999 and signed to Nitro Records, who re- released Beneath the Shadows and put out the band's two subsequent studio albums. Background T.S.O.L. had released their first full-length album, Dance with Me, in 1981 through Frontier Records. Its combination of hardcore punk with horror film- and gothic-inspired subject matter had put the band at the forefront of what was becoming known as \\"deathrock\\".Blush, p. 93. Their subsequent EP, 1982's Weathered Statues, was released through Alternative Tentacles, the record label run by Jello Biafra and East Bay Ray of fellow California hardcore band the Dead Kennedys, with whom T.S.O.L. had performed.Blush, p. 94. The experimental nature and melodic leanings of the EP presaged the musical direction the band would pursue on their next album. With the addition of keyboardist Greg Kuehn to the lineup, the band expanded in new creative directions. According to singer Jack Grisham, improved musicianship and new musical influences were also factors in T.S.O.L.'s stylistic changes: > We learned to play. We wanted to try more things.

It was released in 1983 through Alternative Tentacles as catalog number VIRUS 29. Grisham credited himself as Jack Delauge on the sleeve, following a tradition of using a different pseudonym on each release both to confuse audiences and to hide his true identity from the police. Drummer Todd Barnes credited himself as Todd Scrivener, a pseudonym he had also used on Weathered Statues derived from the name of the street he lived on. Reception Beneath the Shadows received positive reviews from critics. Allmusic's Bradley Torreano remarks that the album \\"blew away all the preconceived notions about the group's sound. T.S.O.L. had put out a record that equaled Meat Loaf when it came to sheer sonic pomposity but still retained their gothic punk leanings. Fans were mildly confused, but the band garnered rave reviews\\". Robert Christgau gave the album a \\"B\\" score, criticizing Grisham's lyrics as uninteresting but calling the musicality \\"so robust and determined it blows all suspicions of nostalgia away.\\" Joe Viglione of Allmusic rated the album 4¬Ω stars out of 5, praising Wilson's production, Grisham's questioning vocals, and the clever nuances of Kuehn's keyboards: \\"Rather than merely copying, T.S.O.L. are exploring. The anti-thesis of 'The Sound of Philadelphia' by MFSB from the disco decade before, there's enough slashing strings and artistry here to satisfy the most rabid fan of true rock & roll when college radio and rock stations forget what they're supposed to be playing. It's there in the evaporated love turned to anger in 'Wash Away', as well as on the closing garage sounds of 'Waiting for You'. Heartbroken choruses which garner the band a Grade A for this excellent effort.\\" Such positive reviews led T.S.O.L. to be included, along with fellow Southern California punk groups D.I. and The Vandals, in director Penelope Spheeris' film Suburbia (1983). T.S.O.L. appears in the film performing \\"Wash Away\\" from Beneath the Shadows and \\"Darker My Love\\", an otherwise unreleased song. Despite the warm critical reception, the band's change in musical direction confused and alienated their hardcore audiences. Mike Boehm of the Los Angeles Times commented that \\"Beneath the Shadows was drenched in rainy romanticism accented by glistening piano and synthesizer shimmers. The album disregarded punk's sonic and attitudinal boundaries and effectively ended the punk chapter of T.S.O.L.'s career.\\" Steven Blush, author of American Hardcore: A Tribal History, writes that \\"the experimental nature of '82's Weathered Statues EP bewildered some fans, but T.S.O.L. lost their hard-to-please fanbase overnight with '83's Beneath the Shadows LP. As a wave of hardcore bands tried a more 'mature' sound in the vein of The Damned, it made sense at the time, but constituted a suicidal career move. Too bad, as Beneath the Shadows sounded powerful and progressive.\\" According to Grisham, the use of synthesizers was unpopular with the hardcore punk crowd: > The trouble with being a popular band is that all your changes are aired for > the public. So yeah, we ventured and a lot of the stuff went too far. But > how do you know where you are if you don't go too far? Using synthesizers > wasn't popular with hardcore. To be honest, a lot of the synth sounds at > that time weren't very good, but we went for it. I've met a lot of people > who say \\"That record was cool.\\" At the time, it was...for me, at least. Critic Jack Rabid, editor of The Big Takeover, has called Beneath the Shadows \\"one of the finest U.S. post-punk LPs ever\\" and cites audiences' rejection of it as a turning point in his dissatisfaction with hardcore: > Beneath the Shadows being rejected by the hardcore scene was the final straw > for me, after many, many straws. Here was this most fascinating outgrowth of > punk ‚Äî they could've been our Damned or Siouxsie and the Banshees ‚Äî > retaining the original guts and drive, taking it into this unique direction. > The hardcore audience rejected them, the rock & roll audience figured they > were still hardcore, so there was no audience for the music. They broke up. > It was a very bad time. It became a rugby game with no meaning. Band changes and re-release Grisham and Barnes both quit T.S.O.L. in late 1983.Blush, p. 95. Grisham cited increased violence and police presence at shows, as well as audiences looking to him for instruction, as factors in his departure. He renounced hardcore to continue in the musical direction of Beneath the Shadows, playing with the keyboard-driven Cathedral of Tears and then with Barnes in Tender Fury. Kuehn also did not stay with T.S.O.L. past Beneath the Shadows, going on to other musical credits including playing with Bob Dylan.Blush, p. 96. Guitarist Ron Emory and bassist Mike Roche continued on as T.S.O.L., bringing in singer Joe Wood and drummer Mitch Dean. Over the course of four more studio albums, the new T.S.O.L. lineup would take the band's style even further from punk rock, moving first in a gothic rock direction, then into hard rock and glam rock before dissolving in 1990. The original T.S.O.L. lineup of Grisham, Emory, Roche, and Barnes reunited in 1991 and won back legal rights to the band's name in 1999. They signed to Nitro Records, who re-released Beneath the Shadows. Though Barnes died in 2000, the band continued on with other drummers and released two studio albums on Nitro, with Kuehn returning for 2003's Divided We Stand. Of the ten songs from Beneath the Shadows, only \\"Wash Away\\" and the title track were included on releases by the reunited lineup: A live recording of \\"Wash Away\\" appears on Live '91 (1991), and a re-recorded version appears on Who's Screwin' Who? (2005). Live recordings of \\"Beneath the Shadows\\" and \\"Wash Away\\" are also included on Live from Long Beach (2008). Alkaline Trio covered \\"Wash Away\\" for the soundtrack of the 2005 video game Tony Hawk's American Wasteland.

A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 7.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1933 VFL Premiership team was South Melbourne. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Gordon Coventry of Collingwood with 108 goals. * The winner of the 1933 Brownlow Medal was Wilfred Smallhorn of Fitzroy with 18 votes. * Essendon took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1933. * The seconds premiership was won by for the third consecutive season. Melbourne 10.15 (75) defeated 10.14 (74) in the Grand Final, played as a stand-alone game on Thursday 28 September (Show Day holiday) at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before a crowd of 9,500. Notable events * \\"Checker\\" Hughes took over as coach of Melbourne. He renamed the team \\"The Demons\\" from \\"The Fuchsias.\\" * In Round 5, St Kilda defeated North Melbourne 13.19 (97) to 11.17 (83), despite having only 15 players left at the end of a brutal match, which was stopped at one stage because a wild brawl, instigated by the North Melbourne players, had erupted in the centre. St Kilda captain Clarrie Hindson had a broken ankle, full-forward Bill Mohr had two broken ribs, forward Jack Anderson had been knocked unconscious, centreman W.C. \\"Billy\\" Roberts was felled once, recovered, and then was felled a second time, and rover Roy \\"Tiger\\" Bence was also knocked out. The St Kilda President, Gallipoli veteran and naval war hero Commander Fred Arlington-Burke, described St Kilda's 15-man victory as the greatest moral victory in the club's history, and a \\"Badge of Courage\\" was struck by the Football Club and was awarded to each of the players that took part in the match. The medallion is silver, coin shaped, with coin-like reeding around its outer perimeter (with no circumferential milling), with a St Kilda Football Club badge affixed to it, and the following inscription: \\"St KILDA DEFEATED Nth MELBOURNE WITH 15 MEN MAY 27th 1933\\". (Photograph of Medal at Ross, 1996, p. 140) * In Round 8, Essendon experimented with a siren, rather than a bell at Windy Hill. * In the 1933 Interstate Carnival, held in Sydney, the Victorian team won all five of its matches. * During the 1933 Carnival, the Australian National Football Council considered a proposal from the New South Wales Rugby Football League that the two codes merge and play a single, Australian \\"national\\" game. A secret trial match of this proposed \\"national\\" game, conducted during the carnival, was unsuccessful. The ANFC subsequently rejected the proposal. * The President of the South Melbourne Football Club, grocery magnate Archie Crofts, had brought so many interstate players to South Melbourne ‚Äì with the promise of a well-paid regular job in one of the Crofts Grocery chain stores in addition to their receiving maximum playing and training fees allowable under the \\"Coulter Law\\" ‚Äì that the 1933 team was christened \\"The Foreign Legion\\". Those comprising the \\"Foreign Legion\\" were Bert Beard, John Bowe, Brighton Diggins, Bill Faul, and Jim O'Meara from Western Australia, Ossie Bertram, Wilbur Harris, and Jack Wade from South Australia, and Frank Davies and Laurie Nash from Tasmania. South Melbourne played in four consecutive Grand Finals from 1933‚Äì1936, but won only the 1933 premiership. *North Melbourne's win over Collingwood in Round 6 was the first by one of the three 1925 entrants (Footscray, Hawthorn, North Melbourne) over the Magpies. Prior to that, Collingwood had won the first 37 meetings against the three newest clubs. Footscray's first win over Collingwood came in Round 9 of this year, but Hawthorn would not record its first win over Collingwood until Round 5 of the 1942 VFL season (in the 30th regular-season meeting between the two clubs).

Quelet discovered several species and was the founder of the Soci√©t√© mycologique de France, a society devoted to mycological studies. Qu√©let, having been born in Mont√©cheroux, Doubs, to a farmer, was soon orphaned, and spent his childhood with and was raised by his aunts. In his youth, he is known to have shown a great interest in mycology and botany in general, but also other subject areas such as ornithology and malacology, the study of mollusks. He was schooled at the Montb√©liard college, and later studied medicine in Strasbourg. In 1884, he founded the mycological society known as the Soci√©t√© mycologique de France, of which he became the first president. Several years after this, in 1888, Qu√©let wrote a book, Flore mycologique de la France et des pays limitrophes (Mycological flora of France and neighbouring countries). Qu√©let also described several species during his mycological research. Some are listed below: *Agaricus bitorquis *Amanita aspera *Bondarzewia montana *Clavariadelphus truncatus *Craterellus tubaeformis *Collybia cirrhata *Lepiota aspera *Lepiota castaneaQuelet L. (1881) Comptes rendu Assoc. Franc. Avanc. Sci. 9: 661 *Russula amethystina *Tricholoma pardinum *Xerocomellus armeniacus Numerous taxa were named after Qu√©let to honor his contributions to mycology, including the species Amanita queletii, Boletus queletii, Entoloma queletii, Russula queletii, and the genus Queletia. Qu√©let has been described to be a combination of Petter Adolf Karsten and Paul Kummer, as far as his conducting of his studies and on his mycological researching skills, as well as by the number of new species he was able to find. Much of Qu√©let's work proves useful still today, and many of the names given to some of the most common fungi can be traced to Qu√©let's work. During the last years of his life, Qu√©let broadened his range of study, perhaps due to eccentricity, as is claimed by some, and began to have new interests in some of the things that fascinated him as a youth ‚Äì ornithology and malacology, among others. At the age of sixty-seven, Lucien Qu√©let died in 1899.

Some critics complained that the film failed to adequately challenge Perle's views.Wired Blogs: The World According to Richard Perle The New York Times called the film \\"a fascinating study in rationalization, a lighter, less repentant version of The Fog of War, Errol Morris's documentary about Robert S.

One critic complained that PBS's endorsement of the neoconservative viewpoint in this film was so misguided, that PBS viewers should express their disgust by \\"either cutting off donations or at least demanding back a percentage of what they've already given\\". Conversely, the producers of an unaired segment, Islam vs. Islamists, claimed they had been victims of liberal bias and subsequently aired their documentary on the Fox News Channel under the provocative title Banned by PBS: Muslims Against Jihad.

Although he became a respected soldier, fighting with Horatio Nelson in the Napoleonic Wars and later rising to the rank of general before becoming aide de camp to Queen Victoria, Menzies is best remembered for the founding of Newcastle, New South Wales and the successful commencement of its settlement between the age of 21 and 22. Early life Menzies was born at Bolfracks House, near Aberfeldy, Perthshire, Scotland, in 1783, the son of Captain Charles Menzies of the 71st Regiment, and mother Sarah Menzies, n√©e Walker. He was educated at Stirling and his family who lived in their ancestral castle, as was done at that time, bought him a commission at the age of 15, as a second lieutenant in the marines on 17 February 1798. Following his commission he saw plenty of action having been posted to duties that involved blockading French ports and chasing the French and Spanish fleets around the Mediterranean sea. He was attached to Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson's squadron off Boulogne, on France's Atlantic coast and was repeatedly involved in attacking shore batteries and engaged in skirmishes with French boats. Arrival in Australia In December 1803 Menzies sailed to Australia on board , which was transporting some convicts to New South Wales and then others to form a new settlement in Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen's land). Menzies was aboard the ship in Port Jackson, Sydney on 5 March 1804 when a rebellion involving a number of convicts broke out in the area of Castle Hill. This incident would later be called the Castle Hill Rebellion and the Second Battle of Vinegar Hill. Menzies with a detachment of 150 marines landed from the ship to help quell the rebellion. He was promoted to lieutenant shortly thereafter. Governor Phillip Gidley King, faced with a need to prevent future outbreaks of this nature, hanged the nine leaders of the 300 rebels involved and ordered the establishment of a new settlement to segregate the Worst of the Irish sent here for Sedition from the other convicts. This was after King in 1800 decided for the same reason to establish the prison town at Castle Hill so as to isolate the \\"political\\" exiles away from the main settlements at Farm Cove, Rose Hill (Parramatta) and Green Hills (Windsor). On 14 March 1804, nine days after the rebellion Menzies wrote to the Governor offering his services as the settlement's commandant. Establishment of Newcastle Governor King accepted this offer and provided Menzies with a Commission dated 15 March 1804, which appointed him as the commander of the settlement of Newcastle. The Commission signed by the Governor noted: Menzies resigned his commission in relation to his detachment of Royal Marines and formed an expedition of skilled personnel including the surgeon James Mileham, Isaac Knight whose role was to be superintendent of the convicts, John Tucker a store-keeper, the botanist George Caley, Ferdinand Bauer an artist, and eleven military guards. Thirty- four especially chosen convicts, including three miners, three timber cutters, two carpenters, a gardener and a salt bailer (with the skill of making salt from salt water) and which also fitted Governor King's description of \\"the worst of the Irish\\" left Sydney on 28 March in three small ships the Lady Nelson, Francis and Resource. The party arrived on 30 March by accounts at noon and Menzies' flotilla anchored of the entrance to Coal River. A boat from Menzies ship and seamen aboard the boat rowed him towards the southern shore of the river. Menzies initially called the settlement Kingstown (after the Governor and as a continuation of the name used for a temporary settlement in 1800)‚Äîbut this reverted to Newcastle, which was the Governor's personal choice. Menzies' year in Newcastle Other than the general Commission provided by the Governor, Menzies was instructed to use the convicts to get \\"as many coals as possible\\", cutting cedar, clearing ground for cultivation and \\"to enforce a due observance of religion and good order\\". Although only aged 21 when he arrived at Newcastle, Menzies proved to be both stern and forward thinking. This was shown by his rules which dictated that convicts would work from sunrise to sunset but have a rest of two hours in the middle of the day. To reduce the possibility of the convicts' escape, food rations were only issued twice a week to stop the convicts from hoarding food for any escape attempt. Menzies befriended the local Awabakal and Worimi peoples, so that they would not assist any escapees. Then later when he discovered a plot by the convicts to assassinate him and the other expedition members he arrested and severely punished the ringleaders. Huts were constructed under his direction for both the expedition members and the convicts. He organised the building of a large stone wharf and established a coal beacon to assist other ships in their navigation into the harbour. Governor King said of Menzies in the year that he was commandant that he \\"fixed that Settlement and brought it to a forward degree of perfection\\". =After Newcastle= After a year establishing Newcastle, Menzies submitted his resignation to Governor King so that he could \\"return to England\\" and his \\"duty in the Royal Marines\\". King accepted his resignation and he left soon after, returning almost immediately to active service including a meritorious role in the war against Napoleon. Menzies was promoted to the rank of captain in the Royal Marine Artillery in April 1813. He commanded the Royal Marine Artillery from 1838 to 1844, progressing through the ranks from major to lieutenant colonel and then in 1857 to general. He was appointed aide-de-camp to the Queen Victoria in 1852. =Marriage and children= Shortly after arriving in Sydney, Menzies had begun a brief liaison with a convict woman called Mindred/Mildred Rose Harrison. Their son, Charles Harrison Menzie, was born on 28 February 1805 in Sydney. Mildred was not among the people listed as going to New Castle with him. Young Charles Harrison Menzie was baptized on 23 June 1805 the day before his father left for England on the \\"Investigator\\". Charles Menzies would never see his eldest son again. Menzies met Maria Wilhelmina, daughter of Dr Robert Bryant, physician to the Duke of Gloucester. They married on 16 December 1817 at Marylebone, Middlesex, England and had five children. Menzies died at Hastings on 22 August 1866.

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1934 VFL Premiership team was Richmond. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Bob Pratt of South Melbourne with 138 goals (150 after finals) * The winner of the 1934 Brownlow Medal was 19 years old Dick Reynolds of Essendon with 19 votes in his second VFL season. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1934. * The seconds premiership was won by for the fourth consecutive season. Melbourne 15.18 (108) defeated 12.4 (76) in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the firsts Grand Final on 13 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * Bob Pratt kicked 150 goals in the 1934 season, reaching his hundredth in only 13 matches. The feat smashed Gordon Coventry's record of 124 goals in the 1929 season, and has yet to be broken. * Gordon Coventry's second goal of the Round 5 game between and was his 1000th career goal, making him the first player to reach that milestone. * On 11 August, the regular South Melbourne centre half-back Laurie Nash played at full-forward for Victoria for three-quarters (the selected full-forward Bill Mohr had broken his finger in the first quarter) and kicked 18 goals in a single match against the SANFL at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Nash had kicked two goals from centre half-forward in the first quarter prior to Mohr's injury, then kicked two more in the second quarter, before dominating the match after half-time with another 14 goals. * In Round 8, Fitzroy ruckman Colin Benham scored his famous \\"in-off the small boy\\" goal. * In the third quarter of the 14 July (round 10 match) between Carlton and Collingwood,The Teams, The Age, (Friday, 13 July 1934), p.7. played at Victoria Park in a heavy cross-wind, Syd Coventry, playing in his 222nd match in his last season for Collingwood,S. Coventry, The Age, (Friday, 13 July 1934), p.7. was knocked out after an altercation with Carlton's Gordon Mackie.  As Coventry was being stretchered off the field, a vicious brawl broke out involving 20 players ‚Äì requiring the assistance of team officials and the police to break it up ‚Äì in which up to ten players were seriously injured.Police intervene in brawl at Collingwood, The Argus, (Monday, 16 July 1934), p. 13.  Three Carlton players were reported: Gordon Mackie was charged with striking Syd Coventry, Harry Maskell was charged with striking Norm Le Brun, and the Carlton captain, Maurie Johnson, was charged with kicking Jack Ross.Brawl at Victoria Park, The Age, (Monday, 16 July 1934), p. 6.  Many of those who had attended the match were astonished that no Collingwood players had been reported for their violent behaviour during the match.For example, 'Clean Sport', \\"Why No Collingwood Reports? (Letter to the Editor)\\", The Age, (Monday, 16 July 1934), p. 6.; \\"Balfe, R.G., \\"Vic. League Must Act: Carlton-Collingwood Brawl: Growing List of Casualties, The Referee, (Thursday, 19 July 1934), p. 1, p. 19, etc.During the tribunal's hearing of the charge against Mackie, evidence was presented that, on two separate occasions earlier in the match, Syd Coventry had struck Mackie in the face without any penalty being given by the umpires: see, for example, Football: Rough Play, The Age, (Wednesday, 25 July 1934), p. 7.  The VFL tribunal found both Maskell and Mackie guilty, and suspended each for six matches. The hearing against Mackie was postponed for a week so that Coventry could attend.Rough Football, The Age, (Wednesday, 18 July 1934), p. 10.Carlton Football Trouble, The Argus, (Wednesday, 25 July 1934), p. 16.  The charge against Johnson was not sustained (although the tribunal was satisfied Johnson had kicked Ross, it was not satisfied that he had kicked Ross deliberately).Sequel to Football Brawl, The Argus, (Wednesday, 18 July 1934), p. 9.  Although the field umpire, Bob Scott, was fortunate to escape sanction for his widely attested incompetence, one of the goal umpires, Percy Jory, and both of the boundary umpires, John Campbell and George Calleson, were suspended for the remainder of the season for their dereliction of duty in relation to the brawl.Three Umpires Suspended: Football Brawl Development, The Argus, (Thursday, 26 July 1934), p. 13. * It is a matter of record that Dick Reynolds won the 1934 Brownlow Medal from Haydn Bunton, Sr by a single vote. Legend has it that Bunton, who had dominated in the last match of the season, tried to \\"suck up to\\" field umpire Jack McMurray as he walked off the playing field, and that Murray, sensing a blatant and improper attempt to influence his Brownlow voting, cast his votes for three other players.

They are noted for founding three, Later Tang, Later Jin, and Later Han, of the five dynasties and one, Northern Han, of the ten kingdoms during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. Origins The Shatuo tribe descended mainly from Western Turkic Chuyue tribe,Ouyang Xiu. Xin Wudaishi. Vol. 4 who in turn belonged to a group of four Chuy tribes, collectively known as Yueban. The Yueban state had survived to the end of 480s, until its independence was destroyed by the Tiele. After the fall of the state, the Yuebans formed four tribes - Chuyue, Chumi, Chumuhun and Chuban. These tribes became major players in the later First Turkic Khaganate and thereafter.Gumilev L.N., \\"Hunnu in China\\", Moscow, 'Science', 1974, Ch. 9, http://gumilevica.kulichki.com/HIC/hic09.htm (In Russian) Chuyue and Chumi did not belong to the dominant Onoq (Ten Arrows) Union, whereto belonged Chumukun and Chuban.Gumilev L.N., \\"Ancient Turks\\", Moscow, 1967, Ch. 16 Other sources derived the Shatuo origins from the Tiele. The epitaph of Shatuo Li Keyong, a late-Tang military commissioner (jiedushi), states that his clan's progenitor was \\"Yidu, Lord of the Xueyantuo state, an unrivaled general\\" (ÁõäÂ∫¶„ÄÅËñõÂª∂ÈôÄÂúãÂêõ„ÄÅÁÑ°ÊïµÂ∞áËªç). However, other Chinese chroniclers traced the Shatuo's origins to a Tiele chief named *Bayar (Êãî‰πü Baye)Xue Juzheng. Jiu Wudaishi, vol. 25 ~ *Bay√Ørku (Êãî‰πüÂè§ Bayegu)Cited by Ouyang Xiu in Xin Wudaishi, vol. 4 Nevertheless, Song historian Ouyang Xiu rejected the Bay√Ørku origin of Shatuo; he pointed out that the Bay√Ørku were contemporaries, not primordial ancestors, of the Shatuo's reigning clan Zhuxie, and that this Western Turkic kingroup adopted Shatuo as tribal name and Zhuxie as surname after their chief Jinzhong (Áõ°Âø†; lit. \\"Loyal to the Utmost\\") had moved into Beiting Protectorate, in Tang Dezong's time (r. 780 - 804). =Shatuo= The Chuyue tribesmembers that remained in the Western Turkic Kaganate, under On-Ok (Ten Tribes) union's leadership, occupied territory east of the lake Barkul, and were called, in Chinese, Shatuo (literally \\"sandy slope\\", i.e. desert). Shatuo consisted of three sub-tribes: Chuyue (ËôïÊúà), Suoge (Â®ëËëõ),Golden, Peter Benjamin (1992). \\"An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples: Ethnogenesis Ans State Formation in the Medieval and Early Modern Eurasia and the Middle East\\". Turcologica. 9. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz. . p. 165 and Anqing (ÂÆâÊÖ∂), the last of whom were of Sogdian origins. Shatuo participated in suppressing many uprisings on behalf of China, and for that the Chinese emperors granted their leaders various titles and rewards. After a defeat of Chuy by Tibetans in 808, Chuy Shatuo branch asked for protection from China, and moved into Inner China. It is known that after suppression of Huang-Chao uprising in 875‚Äì883, and establishing three out of five short-lived dynasties during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period (907-960), their number in China fell down to between 50-100,000, which ruled a Chinese population of about 50 million people. A detailed analysis of the term Shatuo (Sanskrit Sart) is given by Chjan Si-man.prof.

Zuev, \\"Early T√ºrks: Sketches of history and ideology\\", Almaty, Daik-Press, 2002, p. 8, During the Mongol period the Shatuo fell under the Chagatai Khanate, and after its demise remained in its remnant in Zhetysu and northern Tian Shan. The Shatuo received tribute from the Tatar people from norther of the Ordos in 966, while they were vassals of the Khitan Emperor. In later history the Shatuo, together with the Tian Shan Kirgyz, fell under domination of the Mongol Oirats, later known as Kalmyks. With the expansion of the Khanate of Kokand, the Tian Shan and Zhetysu Shatuo were in its protectorate. Shatuo and the Tang Dynasty Lineage of the Shatuo T√ºrks To the Tang Dynasty, the Shatuo served a purpose. Some claim that they were a part of the Tang dynasty's foreign policy to control and manage other 'border' peoples identified as a threat. Some argue that a divide and conquer policy was applied against those identified as a threat, specifically the Tibetans and Turkic tribes in Central Asia. The Tang Chinese continued this long policy and in other epochs this became an institutionalised tradition. =Emerging Shatuo= At the beginning of the 8th century, the Shatuo were subject to the Tang Empire. They provided significant aid to Emperor Suzong of Tang, alongside the Uyghurs, during the An Shi Rebellion in the 750s. Indeed, Yao Runeng (ÂßöÂ¶ÇËÉΩ) mentioned, in the 9th-century \\"Deeds of An Lushan\\", two separate tribes Shatuo Ê≤ôÈôÄ and Zhuye (Êú±ËÄ∂) ~ Zhuxie Êú±ÈÇ™, among the non-Chinese tribes in the He and Long regions under Turko- Khotanese loyalist superintendent Geshu Han (Âì•ËàíÁø∞, d. 757). Shatuo would designate geographical origin and Zhuye would become the ruling house's surname or appellation, both associated with \\"one single kinship group\\". Shatuo chieftain Zhuye Guduozhi was conferred the title of tejin (governor) and xiaowei shang-jiangjun (colonel high general). By the end of the eighth century, the Shatuo had fallen out with the Tang Empire. They joined with other Turkic tribes in Tibet to form an alliance with the Tibetans as they felt oppressed by the Uyghurs. Though the Shatuo fought alongside Tibetan armies for more than a decade against the Tang, the Tibetans were concerned about their loyalty. When, in 808, the Shatuo decided to leave, the Tibetans pursued them, fighting battles along the way. They made it to Lingzhou Prefecture in the Gansu corridor, where Tang general Fan Xichao granted them asylum. A source quotes them as committing mass suicide in 832 while fighting for an Uyghur ruler, but this seems to refer to a related tribe who had settled far west, into the Fergana valley. The Shatuo who had escaped Tibetan rage managed to maintain a power base in northern China around modern-day Shanxi from the late ninth century into the tenth century. In the middle of the ninth century, it may be said that the Shatuo rewarded the generosity of the Tang by fighting alongside them against the invading Tibetans, playing a prominent role in numerous victories. They also helped quell the Pang Xun Rebellion and the Wang Xianzhi Rebellion. =Li Keyong= The Shatuo Li Keyong was conferred the post of cishi for Dai County. He hired more than ten thousand Tatar nomads to bring back to Daizhou, but was denied admittance to the Shiling Pass. In 882, Su You and Helian Duo joined to prepare for an attack on Li. However, he launched a pre-emptive on Su's stronghold at Weizhou Island. The Tang emperor would soon offer amnesty to assist against Huang Chao, who led a fierce rebellion against the Tang. Li Keyong was named the Prince of Jin in 895 for his loyalty to the Tang. Five Dynasties The Tang Dynasty fell in 907 and was replaced by the Later Liang. The Shatuo had their own principality Jin (Later Tang precursor) under the Tang dynasty, in the area now known as Shanxi, which was granted as a fief in 883 by the Tang emperors in and survived the fall of the Tang dynasty in 907. The Tang dynasty emperor's had granted the Shatuo Zhuye chieftain Li Keyong the imperial surname of Li and title Prince of Jin, adopting him into the imperial family. They had tense relations with the Later Liang, and cultivated good relations with the emerging Khitan power to the north. =Later Tang= The son of Li Keyong, Li Cunxu, succeeded in destroying the Later Liang in 923, declaring himself the emperor of the ‚ÄúRestored Tang‚Äù, officially known as the Later Tang, using the fact that his family was granted the imperial Li surname of the Tang dynasty and a princely title to declare themselves legitimate Tang dynasty emperors. In line with claims of restoring the Tang, Li moved the capital from Kaifeng back to Luoyang, where it was during the Tang Dynasty. The Later Tang controlled more territory than the Later Liang, including the Beijing area, the surrounding Sixteen Prefectures and Shaanxi Province. This was the first of three short-lived Shatuo dynasties. The last Later Tang Emperor was a Han Chinese, Li Congke, originally surnamed Wang who was adopted by the Shatuo Later Tang Emperor Li Siyuan, granted the imperial surname Li and made the Prince of Lu. =Later Jin= The Later Tang was brought to an end in 936 when Shi Jingtang (posthumously known as Gaozu of Later Jin), also a Shatuo, successfully rebelled against the Han Chinese Later Tang emperor Li Congke and established the Later Jin Dynasty. Shi moved back the capital to Kaifeng, then called Bian. The Later Jin controlled essentially the same territory as the Later Tang except the strategic Sixteen Prefectures area, which had been ceded to the expanding Liao Empire established by the Khitans. Later historians would denigrate the Later Jin as a puppet regime of the powerful Liao to the north. When Shi's successor did defy the Liao, a Khitan invasion resulted in the end of the dynasty in 946. =Later Han and Northern Han= The death of the Khitan emperor on his return from the raid on the Later Jin left a power vacuum that was filled by Liu Zhiyuan, another Shatuo who founded the Later Han in 947. The capital was at Bian (Kaifeng) and the state held the same territories as its predecessor. Liu died after a single year of reign and was succeeded by his teenage son, in turn unable to reign for more than two years, when this very short-lived dynasty was ended by the Later Zhou. The remnants of the Later Han returned to the traditional Shatuo Turk stronghold of Shanxi and established the Northern Han Kingdom. The Last Northern Han Emperor, Liu Jiyuan was originally surnamed He but was adopted by his maternal grandfather, the Northern Han Emperor Liu Chong and granted the Imperial surname Liu. Liu Jiyuan granted the imperial surname to the Han Chinese general Yang Ye and adopted him as a brother. Under the protection of the Khitan Liao Dynasty, the tiny kingdom survived until 979 when it was finally incorporated into the Song Dynasty.  Song Dynasty  By 960, most of the ethnic-Shatuo members had assimilated with Han Chinese. An example being Empress Xiaozhang of the Song Dynasty, who was of mixed Han and Shatuo ancestry. Shatuo that remained in the steppe will be incorporated and assimilated into Mongols, as between the 10th to 13th centuries, Shatuo remnants possibly joined Mongolic-speaking Tatar confederation in the territory of the modern Mongolia, and became known as Ongud or White Tatars branch of the Tatars.Ozkan Izgi, \\"The ancient cultures of Central Asia and the relations with the Chinese civilization\\" The Turks, Ankara, 2002, p. 98, Paulillo, Mauricio. \\"White Tatars: The Problem of the √ñng≈©t conversion to Jingjiao and the Uighur Connection\\" in From the Oxus River to the Chinese Shores: Studies on East Syriac Christianity in China and Central Asia (orientalia - patristica - oecumenica) Ed.

It is named for the historical British North American territory of Rupert's Land, which was contained within the original diocesan boundaries. The diocese is located in southern Manitoba and north-western Ontario, consisting of the area immediately surrounding Winnipeg, stretching north from the Canada‚ÄìUS border to near the top of Lake Winnipeg, and extending over the Ontario border to incorporate the parishes of the former southern region of the Diocese of Keewatin.Rupert's Land Keewatin Boundary Changes. Rupert's Land diocesan website, 19 June 2014. Its See city is Winnipeg, and its approximately 14,000 Anglicans on the parish rolls are served by 74 congregations, of which 32 are located in Winnipeg. Major centres, apart from Winnipeg, include Selkirk, Portage la Prairie, and Kenora. The area of the diocese was the cradle of European settlement in western Canada, and was thus the original locus of Anglican missionary activity there. The first Anglican service was held at the Red River Colony in 1820, and three years later the first Anglican church in western Canada was constructed. In 1849, the diocese was formally established with jurisdiction over all the territory of present-day Canada west of Ontario, as well as parts of northern and western Ontario. In 1866, there were two archdeaconries: W. Cochrane was Archdeacon of Assiniboia and James Hunter of Cumberland.The Clergy List for 1866 (London: George Cox, 1866) p. 452 The first synod was convened twenty years later, and the diocese was incorporated in 1886. The diocese played an important part in the growing autonomy of Anglicanism in Canada. After the Diocese of British Columbia was hived off in 1859, Rupert Land's second bishop, Robert Machray, helped divide the still sprawling diocese into four smaller ones, creating in 1874 the new dioceses of Athabasca, Moosonee and Saskatchewan and a new ecclesiastical province which (rather confusingly) is also named after Rupert's Land. Machray would go on to become the first Primate of the Church of England in Canada, playing an instrumental role in establishing the Lambeth Conference of worldwide Anglican bishops, now one of the instruments of unity of the Anglican Communion. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the diocese also played a key role in the missionary activity of the Anglican Church in western Canada, particularly in the prairie provinces and the Arctic. The original vast territory of the Diocese of Rupert's Land is now served by 18 dioceses (British Columbia has been divided into 5 dioceses, gained 1, and is now a separate province, Athabasca has been divided into 4 and lost 2, Moosonee has been transferred to the province of Ontario, Saskatchewan has been divided into 5 and the residual Rupert's Land further subdivided into 4). Before the August 2014 incorporation of the north- western Ontario parishes (formerly part of the Diocese of Keewatin), the geographical expanse of the diocese was 72,500 square kilometres. The Bishop of Rupert's Land (the twelfth) is the Right Reverend Geoffrey Woodcroft, who was consecrated in 2018. The Dean of St. John's Cathedral is the Very Reverend Paul Johnson. The diocese sponsored a lay order, the Company of the Cross, which ran a controversial school for boys called Saint John's Cathedral Boys' School that was closed in the 1990s. The school was conservative and prided itself in pushing boys to their physical and psychological breaking points. It spawned two other schools, Saint John's School of Alberta and Saint John's School of Ontario, where 12 boys and a teacher died on a poorly planned canoe trip.

A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Estes as the 77th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. In order to develop a statistical explanation for the learning phenomena, William Kaye Estes developed the Stimulus Sampling Theory in 1950 which suggested that a stimulus-response association is learned on a single trial; however, the learning process is continuous and consists of the accumulation of distinct stimulus-response pairings. Background and education As an undergraduate, Estes was a student of Richard M. Elliott at the University of Minnesota. As a graduate student he stayed at the University of Minnesota, and worked under B. F. Skinner, with whom he developed the conditioned suppression paradigm (Estes & Skinner, 1941). After receiving his doctorate, Estes joined Skinner on the faculty of Indiana University. After Estes got out of the U. S. Army at the end of World War II, he established his reputation as one of the originators of mathematical learning theory. Estes went from Indiana University to Stanford University, to Rockefeller University in New York, and finally to Harvard University. While teaching at Harvard University, Estes contributed as an instituting first editor of the Psychological Science for the Association for Psychological Science. He was also editor of Psychological Review from 1977-1982 After retiring from Harvard, Estes returned to Bloomington, Indiana, where he remained active in academics to become professor emeritus at his original academic home department. One of Estes' most famous contributions to learning theory was stimulus-sampling theory, which conceives of learning as establishing associations to hypothetical stimulus elements that are randomly drawn from a pool of elements that characterize a particular learning situation. This theory predicted probability matching, which has been found in a wide range of tasks for many different organisms. Estes has had a major influence on theories of learning and memory, both in his own theorizing and in the theories of his many students and collaborators. In honor of his impact within the field of psychology, Estes received the National Medal of Science on December 16, 1997 from President Bill Clinton. Estes on education Estes proposed a model of learning that he called Stimulus Sampling Theory (SST). SST is a probabilistic model that provides a statistical explanation of how we learn a stimulus-response association in a single trial, but require more stimulus-response repetitions to build an evident unit of learning. Stimulus- sampling models aid at least two functions. One is to make experimental predictions for situations in which the stimulus elements are controlled, in part at least, by the experimenter. The stimulus-sampling theory also aids as a heuristic device for discovering effective truisms about changes in response probabilities. The general theory of stimulus-sampling assumes the existence of a population of discrete stimulus elements and hypothesizes that an entity draws a sample from this population on each trial of a learning experiment. All stimulus-response theories have stimuli that are \\"connected\\" or \\"conditioned\\" to possible responses of the entity. A natural extension of SST theory provides explanations of discrimination, generalization, temporal processes, and even motivational phenomena. The \\"folding-in\\" technique used in classrooms today is derived from the stimulus sampling theory. An example of the folding-in procedure is a student reviewing ten flash cards (seven known, three unknown) and working through them till the student learns the ten cards 100%. After learning the ten cards, the student then replaces the three originally unknown cards with three more unknown cards. This drill is used to promote acquisition and fluency, and studies have shown that drill is extremely effective in teaching a wide range of responses. Career highlights ;1941 :Estes and his mentor B.F. Skinner presented their analysis of anxiety, introducing the conditioned emotional response (CER)/conditioned fear response (CFR) paradigm, where rats were trained to respond on an operant schedule that produced a steady response rate, after which they were tested with an electric shock stimulus that was conditioned as a fear signal. The fear signal suppressed the operant response, and the magnitude of suppression was used as a mesure of anxiety. The CER/CFR became widely used to study Pavlovian conditioning in a variety of organisms. ;1950 :Estes presented his influential stimulus sampling theory in the Psychological Review article Toward a Statistical theory of Learning. This theory assumes that conditioning involves associating responses to the elements of a stimulus that are sampled on a particular trial. Variability in learning arises because of the statistical properties of sampling elements randomly from a larger population of potential elements. ;Later Works: :;1970 ::Learning Theory and Mental Development :;1991 ::Statistical Models in Behavioral Research :;1994 ::Classification and Cognition Notable affiliations =Awards and honors= *1962 Distinguished Research and Contribution Award from the American Psychological Association *1963 Warren Medal from the Society of Experimental Psychologists, Nominated to the National Academy of Science *1992 American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Psychological Science *1997 National Medal of Science for his \\"'fundamental theories of learning, memory, and decision'\\" by President Bill Clinton Selected bibliography * See also Mathematical psychology References   Category:1919 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Cognitive scientists Category:Fellows of the Society of Experimental Psychologists Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:University of Minnesota alumni Category:Indiana University faculty Category:Stanford University Department of Psychology faculty Category:Rockefeller University faculty Category:Harvard University faculty Category:National Medal of Science laureates Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences ","title":"William Kaye Estes"},{"id":"10790604","text":"William Estes may refer to: *William Kaye Estes (born 1919), American scientist *William Lee Estes (1870-1930), U.S. federal judge *Will Estes (born 1978), American actor *William R.

Premiership season In 1935, the VFL competition consisted of twelve teams of 18 on-the-field players each, plus one substitute player, known as the 19th man. A player could be substituted for any reason; however, once substituted, a player could not return to the field of play under any circumstances. Teams played each other in a home-and- away season of 18 rounds; matches 12 to 18 were the \\"home-and-way reverse\\" of matches 1 to 7. Once the 18 round home-and-away season had finished, the 1935 VFL Premiers were determined by the specific format and conventions of the Page-McIntyre System. =Round 1= - bgcolor=\\"#CCCCFF\\"  Home team  Home team score  Away team  Away team score  Venue  Crowd  Date -

(For an explanation of scoring see Australian rules football). Awards * The 1935 VFL Premiership team was Collingwood. * The VFL's leading goalkicker was Bob Pratt of South Melbourne with 97 goals (103 after finals). * The winner of the 1935 Brownlow Medal was Haydn Bunton, Sr of Fitzroy with 24 votes. * North Melbourne took the \\"wooden spoon\\" in 1935. * The seconds premiership was won by for the fifth consecutive season. Melbourne defeated in the Grand Final, played as a curtain-raiser to the firsts Grand Final on 5 October at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Notable events * In February 1935, the VFL advanced an emergency interest-free loan of ¬£500 to the North Melbourne Football Club, which had not won a match since 19 August 1933. * The VFL experimented with rubber footballs during pre-season practice matches. The experiment was not successful: the balls were found to float far too much in the air, and bounce far too much on the ground. * Footscray changed their jumper design from the traditional red and white hoops on a blue background to a jumper with vertical red and blue stripes with white piping. Designed to make the club more distinctive, these jumpers were destroyed when dry-cleaned at the end of the season. * On 30 March, a practice match between Richmond and South Melbourne is played at night, with a white ball, under electric light at Olympic Park. * On 18 May, 24-year-old Clen Denning played his first VFL senior match. Playing in the forward-pocket for Carlton, against South Melbourne, he kicked a goal with each of his first six kicks in the match. * In the third quarter of the round 18 match between Essendon and Geelong, Geelong was clawing back Essendon's lead, when the Windy Hill ground was invaded by a swarm of schoolboys. A small balloon had drifted over the ground and had dropped small parachutes and papers, and the schoolboys invaded the ground to capture the \\"treasures\\" dropped from the balloon, oblivious of the fact that the match was still in progress. The match was delayed for some time before order was restored. Essendon eventually won the match 14.23 (107) to 11.13 (79). * At the end of the 1935 season, the Hawthorn Football Club was unable to make any of its contracted payments to its players, many of whom were unemployed and relying on the ¬£3 weekly match fees to sustain their families. * On Grand Final eve, South Melbourne's champion full-forward Bob Pratt was hit by a brick truck when alighting from a tram. He was replaced in the team by Roy Moore. Neither Moore at full-forward nor Laurie Nash at centre half-forward scored a goal in the match; their opponents were Charlie Dibbs and Jack Regan respectively.

He was deputy leader of the Liberal Party and deputy opposition leader from 1985 to 1987, under John Howard. He served as Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (1981‚Äì1982) and Minister for Communications (1982‚Äì1983) in the Fraser Government. Early life Brown grew up in Essendon, in Melbourne's inner north. His father Alexander Brown was an electrical mechanic. He attended Moonee Ponds Central School and University High School, and went on to study law at the University of Melbourne. During his studies he worked part-time at the office of the Victorian Public Solicitor. He was admitted to the Victorian Bar in 1964, and appointed Queen's Counsel in 1980. Politics Brown joined the Liberal Party in 1955, at the age of 15. He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1969, standing in the Division of Diamond Valley. He was 29 years old at the time, making him the Coalition's youngest MP. He was defeated by the Labor candidate in 1972, and returned to his legal practice, focusing primarily on industrial law. Brown reclaimed Diamond Valley at the 1975 election. In 1980, he spent several weeks in Zimbabwe as the head of a team of Australian observers at the 1980 elections. In April 1981, he was elevated to the ministry as Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs in the Fraser Government. He was briefly appointed Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs following the forced resignation of John Moore in April 1982. His major act in that portfolio was the announcement of an inquiry into the \\"colour-television affair\\" which had led to the resignations of Moore and Michael MacKellar. The following month Brown was promoted to cabinet as Minister for Communications. He held that position until the Fraser Government was defeated at the 1983 election; he again lost the seat of Diamond Valley to a Labor candidate. At the early 1984 election, Brown re-entered parliament as the member for the newly created Division of Menzies. After the election he was appointed to Andrew Peacock's shadow cabinet as Shadow Attorney-General. In September 1985, Brown was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party and thus Deputy Leader of the Opposition, roles which had been vacated by John Howard when he replaced Peacock as party leader. He defeated eleven other candidates for the position, finishing with 36 out of 70 votes on the final ballot compared with fifteen for Ian Macphee, eleven for John Moore, and eight for Peter Shack. In December 1985, Brown acted as party leader for two weeks while Howard recovered from an ear operation. However, National Party leader Ian Sinclair was the acting leader of the opposition during that time. Brown served as Howard's deputy until July 1987, when a leadership spill was called in the aftermath of the party's defeat at the 1987 election. After several other candidates emerged, he did not recontest the position and was replaced by Andrew Peacock (an unsuccessful challenger for the leadership against Howard). Peter Shack, who was an unsuccessful candidate to replace Brown as deputy, made a criticism of Brown as he stated that coming after the Liberals' defeat at the recent 1987 election, its third consecutive defeat, the Liberal Party needed a deputy leader who could give \\"visible and effective political and parliamentary support to the leader\\".https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/118143777 Brown remained a Coalition frontbencher ‚Äì under Howard, Peacock, and John Hewson ‚Äì until his unexpected resignation from parliament in February 1991. He returned to his law practice. The resulting by-election was won by the Liberal candidate Kevin Andrews. Later life In 1993, Brown published a memoir titled On the Other Hand: Sketches and Reflections From Political Life. Reviewing the book for The Canberra Times, Jack Waterford compared it to the Alan Clark Diaries and described the author as \\"one of the more remarkable politicians to ever reach the top, or near top, of the Liberal Party\\". Brown let his membership of the Liberal Party lapse in 2001, due to dissatisfaction with the actions of the Howard Government. As of 2006, he was a mediator and arbitrator in domestic and international commercial, trade and construction matters and in Internet domain name disputes. Brown writes a weekly column for The Spectator Australia.Neil Brown Personal life Brown married in 1985, and had two stepchildren from his wife's first marriage. His wife Margaret was the Liberal candidate at the 1989 Greensborough state by-election. They later divorced and she remarried. Brown came out publicly in 1996, when he was included (with his permission) in OutRage magazine's list of prominent gays and lesbians. In a 1998 interview, he said that his wife had known about his sexuality before they married. He described himself as gay, but also agreed that the term bisexual was applicable. He was one of the first Australian politicians ‚Äì serving or otherwise ‚Äì to come out publicly.

Career In 1951, he began teaching at the Art Students League. His painting, the Resurrection of Christ, can be seen in Old St. Patrick‚Äôs Cathedral in New York City. In 1962, he received a commission to paint eight large paintings of the Life of St. Anthony of Padua, which were permanently installed in the 11th Century Church of San Giovanni de Malta, in Venice, where his paintings hang alongside a painting by Giovanni Bellini. Consequently, the Order of Malta conferred upon him the Cross of Merit, Prima Classe. He became the first painter to receive the honor since Caravaggio.

C·ª≠ was trained in the United States as a pilot, and had not been promoted for six years, which he felt was due to his father‚Äôs opposition to Di·ªám, who had him briefly jailed for \\"antigovernment activities.\\" C·ª≠ felt that Di·ªám was not focused enough on fighting the Vietcong, but was preoccupied with maintaining power. He criticised the Americans for their support for Di·ªám, which he felt had stifled the war effort, saying \\"I felt that the Americans had slammed the door on those of us who really wanted the fight against the Communists.\\" They had planned for C·ª≠, and Ph·∫°m Ph√∫ Qu·ªëc, who he had recruited from his squadron, to attack the Independence Palace (Dinh ƒê·ªôc L·∫≠p) on 27 February. C·ª≠ had persuaded Qu·ªëc by claiming that all the armed services and the United States were aware of the plot, showing him a Newsweek article critical of Di·ªám. Attack Qu·ªëc and C·ª≠ were scheduled to fly on an early morning mission into the Mekong Delta to attack the Vietcong, but turned around to attack the palace. The French colonial-era palace was in flames as their two fighter aircraft, World War II model AD-6s, supplied by the United States, dropped bombs and napalm. Several rockets as well as machine gun fire were fired at the compound. The assault ended within an hour, but the pilots did not empty their full load, which would have been sufficient to level the palace. On a cloudy day, they flew at low altitudes of around , completing cycles before ascending above the clouds. Di·ªám and his family escaped unhurt, with three servants killed and thirty injured. Qu·ªëc's plane was damaged by fire; he ejected over the Saigon River and landed in Nh√† B√®. C·ª≠ managed to reach Cambodia safely, believing his attack had been successful. As a result, he gave reporters a press conference, telling them of the military's hate for Di·ªám and his regime. Initially arrested by the police, C·ª≠ remained in exile in Cambodia where he worked as a language teacher. After Di·ªám's assassination in November 1963, C·ª≠ returned from exile and resumed his service in the Air Force. In June 1975, after the Communists' victory in the Vietnam War, C·ª≠ was arrested and sent to a re- education camp for ten years until his release in 1985. He immigrated to the United States in 1991.

Until 1918 it was mainly a burial ground for the Catholic and Protestant communities of the city, principally ethnic Germans, and thus it was also called the German Cemetery (). After 1918 the cemetery was secularized and accepted the dead of all confessions, including the Orthodox clergy. Throughout its history it has also been extensively used as a military cemetery. It is located on a 20 hectare lot between Gospitalny Val Street and Nalichnaya Street at .  Origins  Between late 1771 and 1772, Catherine the Great, Empress of the Russian Empire, issued an edict which decreed that, from that point on, any person who died (regardless of their social standing or class origins), no longer had the right to be buried within church crypts or adjacent churchyards. New cemeteries had to be built across the entire Russian empire and from then on they all had to be located outside city limits. One of the main motivations behind these measures was overcrowding in church crypts and graveyards. However, the true deciding factor which led to the new laws being enforced on such a mass scale across the entire Russian empire was to avoid further outbreaks of highly contagious diseases, especially the black plague which had led to the Plague Riot in Moscow in 1771. When the Vvedenskoye cemetery was established in the early 1770s, an older, 16th- century German cemetery was incorporated into it. This older cemetery was located near German Quarter (on the opposite bank of Yauza River), which had traditionally served the Lutheran community and other Western Christian denominations. In addition to German community, the cemetery tended to substantial English, Polish and Italian populations. Unusual for Russian cemeteries, some graves, notably of Polish gentry, were set up as standalone crypts with walk-in chapels; these are now in a dilapidated state. Most graves, however, are plain headstones or crosses; traditional Russian sarcophagus-styled tombs of this period are rare and usually belong to Orthodox dead, originally buried elsewhere and relocated to Vvedenskoe later. Image:Vvedenskoye - Gothic crypt 06.jpg Image:Vvedenskoye - Red crypt 01.jpg Image:Vvedenskoye - Musina-Pushkina 01.jpg Image:Vvedenskoye - English crypt 01.jpg  19th century  Due to the proximity of Lefortovo, Preobrazhenskoe and Semyonovskoe military facilities, Vvedenskoe also became a common site for burying deceased military - Russian servicemen as well as foreign prisoners of war. In 1889 the French government erected a memorial obelisk at the mass grave of soldiers of Grande Arm√©e soldiers who died during the French invasion of Russia in 1812-1814\\\\. In 1914-1918 the cemetery also tended to the German and Austrian prisoners of First World War. In the 19th century, the remains of Peter the Great generals Franz Lefort and Patrick Gordon, both who died in 1699, were exhumed and transferred to Vvedenskoye. Also buried at Vvedenskoye is the general-major Karl Staal, who was commander of Astrakhan cuirassier regiment in the 1813-1814 War of the Sixth Coalition against Napoleon. One of the most unusual tombs, of railroad engineer and educator Christian Meyen, is assembled of rail car wheels and steam engine parts and crowned with a 5-meter wrought iron cross. =Notable people buried before the revolution of 1917= Image:Vvedenskoye - Patrick Gordon 01.jpgPatrick Gordon Image:Vvedenskoye - Karl Staal 01.jpgKarl Staal Image:Vvedenskoye - Francesco Camporesi 01.jpgFrancesco Camporesi Image:Vvedenskoye - French of 1812 01.jpgFrench of 1812 * Santino Campioni (1774‚Äì1847), sculptor * August Davidov (1823-1885), mathematician * Semyon Eybushitz (1851‚Äì1898), architect * John Field (1782‚Äì1837), composer * Friedrich (Fyodor) Haass (1780‚Äì1853), physician and philanthropist * Gustav List (1835‚Äì1913), businessman and philanthropist * Lucien Olivier (1838‚Äì1883), chef * Pavel Petrovich Pahlen (1775‚Äì1834), cavalry general * Leonid Timister (1844‚Äì1905), businessman and philanthropist * Pavel Pabst (1854‚Äì1897) pianist, composer and teacher  Soviet period and beyond  Graves of Normandie-Niemen servicemen on a lot adjacent to the French of 1812 obelisk Upon secularization in 1918, new non-denominational graves gradually took over the older, untended, grave sites. As a result, today the historical graves are scattered among the majority of post-1918 graves. During World War II, many soldiers who died in the nearby Lefortovo hospitals were buried here including 50 Heroes of the Soviet Union among whom was Stepan Kretov (1919‚Äì1975), and the deceased French pilots from the Normandie-Niemen regiment. The latters' remains were relocated to France in the 1950s, however one tomb of Unknown French Pilot, killed in action in July 1943, is still preserved. The cemetery still allows burials; some historical family lots continue to date since early 19th century (some under original surnames, some under different ones when changed through marriage). In some instances, like the Pikersgills descending from Englishman John Pickersgill of Howgrave in Yorkshire (1765‚Äì1841), original lots were too small to accommodate future generations, and were eventually re-established on different sites. =Notable people buried in Soviet period= * Osip Abdulov, actor * Vsevolod Abdulov, actor * Yefim Baranovich (1884-1948), military leader * Grigory Barkhin, architect * Robert Bartini, aircraft designer * Leonid Grossman (1888‚Äì1965), writer * Anna Izryadnova (1891‚Äì1946), wife of Sergei Yesenin * Roman Klein (1858‚Äì1924), architect * Nikolai Kolli (1894‚Äì1966), architect * Nikolai Koltsov (1872‚Äì1940), biologist * Ivan Sergeyevich Kuznetsov (1867‚Äì1942), architect * Konstantin Melnikov (1890‚Äì1974), architect * Sophia Parnok (1885-1933), poet * Valeri Popenchenko (1937‚Äì1975) Olympic Gold Medal winning Boxer. * Mikhail Prishvin (1873‚Äì1954), writer * Ivan Rerberg (1869‚Äì1932), architect * Alexander Filipovich Samoilov (1867‚Äì1930), physiologist * Pyotr Sobolevsky (1904‚Äì1977), film actor * Ivan Susloparov (1897‚Äì1974), Red Army general who signed the first set of documents for unconditional surrender of Germany May 7, 1945 in Rheims * Ivan Sytin (1851‚Äì1934), businessman, publisher and educator * Metropolitan Trifon (Boris Petrovich Turkestanov, 1861‚Äì1934) * Artists Victor Vasnetsov (1848‚Äì1926) and Apollinary Vasnetsov (1856‚Äì1933) * Stanislav Vaupshasov (1899‚Äì1976), NKVD guerilla operative, Hero of the Soviet Union * Maria Yudina (1899‚Äì1970), great Russian pianist There is also a cenotaph to Iona Yakir (1896‚Äì1937).

Notable events * Prior to the season, the Richmond Football Club formally announced its intentions to move its home base from the Punt Road Oval to the nearby Olympic Park, owing mostly to an ongoing dispute with the Richmond Cricket Club. Such a move required the approval of the League's Board of Management; the vote was tied 6‚Äì6, then voted down by the casting vote of League president William McClelland (a casting vote for the status quo was customary in the event of a tie). As such, Richmond was forced to remain at the Punt Road Oval. * In Round 1, the first goal kicked by South Melbourne's Bob Pratt against Melbourne was his 500th career goal. * In Round 7, Collingwood full-forward Gordon Coventry scored his 1,200th VFL goal. * All Round 10 matches were postponed because all VFL grounds were under water following an extended period of torrential rain. All subsequent rounds were also pushed back by one week. * After Round 13, Gordon Coventry was suspended for eight weeks for striking Richmond's Joe Murdoch, and missed the finals series. * After Round 14, Essendon's forward-pocket Ted Bryce was suspended for eighteen weeks for kicking Carlton rover Norm Cashin. * In Round 17, field-umpire Jack McMurray umpired his 300th senior VFL match. * In Round 18, needing seven goals to reach 100, St Kilda's full-forward Bill Mohr kicked eight goals, finishing his season with 101 goals.

It was initiated by China moving a company of troops to Wangdung, a pasture to the south of Sumdorong Chu that India believed to be its territory. The Indian troops stood their ground on the neighbouring Longro La ridge and both the sides moved a large number of troops to the border. The crisis was diffused after the visit of Indian External Affairs minister to Beijing in May 1987. The standoff was the first military confrontation along the disputed McMahon Line after the 1962 war and gave rise to fears of escalation. Subsequently, India and China formulated agreements for managing future border tensions. Background Since 1962, India had not returned to the site of its major defeat at Namka Chu, an east-west running stream which separates the Thag La and the Hathung La ridge to its south. India's efforts to occupy Thag La was the casus belli for the October 1962 Chinese military attack on India. Because there were no other feasible defensive locations north of Tawang, the government had more or less decided that in the event of a new war, they would abandon the town and prepare for battle at the Se La pass to its east. However, after the 1980 review, it was decided by the military strategists that it was important to defend Tawang in a future conflict.Line of Actual Control remains sore point between India and China (\\"LAC: Chequered Past\\", printed along with \\"George in China Shop\\"), India Today, 18 May 1998. The army made it clear that the only viable line of defence for Tawang would be along the Hathung La ridge. In 1983, an Intelligence Bureau team went to the pasturage of Sumdorong Chu which is north-east of the confluence of the Namka Chu and Nyamjiang Chu. The defence forces stayed through the summer and returned in winter. This procedure was followed for two years. In 1986, Indian forces found that the Chinese had preceded them and set up semi-permanent structures there and were not willing to budge. Under orders of General Sundarji and codenamed Operation Falcon, the Indians undertook an airlift of troops and vehicles to Zemithang from 18 to 20 October 1986. Taking up locations on multiple heights, including Hathung La ridge, Indian troops were able to strategically occupy the high ground near Sumdorong Chu. This was followed by more mobilisation by both sides. China called for a flag meeting on 15 November. The standoff continued until May 1987. Political context At the end of 1986, India granted statehood to Arunachal Pradesh. The Chinese government proceeded to protest. But the military movements in Tawang, taken in conjunction with this political action were seen as a provocation by the Chinese. In early 1987 Beijing's tone became similar to that of 1962, and with the Indian Army refusing to stand down, Western diplomats predicted war. The result was a thaw. Indian Foreign Minister N.D. Tiwari arrived in Beijing in May 1987 en route to Pyongyang, North Korea. He carried with him messages from Indian leaders that there was no intention on New Delhi's part to aggravate the situation. The first formal flag meeting to discuss ‚Äú the freezing of the situation‚Äù since 1962, was held on the fifth of August 1987 at Bum La in the aftermath of the Wangdung affair. Both sides decided to take up talks with renewed urgency and the following year, Rajiv Gandhi visited Beijing, returning Zhou Enlai's '60s visit.Manoj Joshi, \\"Warrior as a Scholar\\", \\"India Today \\". Aftermath Both India and China realised the danger of inadvertent conflict and after initial posturing the decision was made to de-escalate their deployments. The Sumdorong Chu fallout was that India and China decided to restart their dialogue on a new and more urgent basis. After Rajiv Gandhi's September 1988 visit, there was a hiatus of sorts because of political turmoil in India. But finally in 1993, the two countries signed an agreement to ensure peace along the LAC. The agreement brought in an interesting concept of \\"mutual and equal\\" security where thinning of forces was envisaged, based on geographical and logistical considerations.

It served the entire city and was part of the Toledo Public School District. In 1959 the school became joint-operational with Macomber High School, an all-boys vocational school located next door, and the two buildings came to be known as Macomber-Whitney. Despite the fact that they shared an urban campus and some operational efficiencies, the two schools were completely separate in faculties, enrollments, and curriculum until the 1973-1974 school year. In the spring of 1972, an assembly was held for Macomber sophomores. They were told that they could major in one of several programs offered at Whitney, taking core courses at Whitney and other courses required for graduation at Macomber. The available programs included Distributive Education, Business Technology, Marketing, and Data Processing. Some 50 boys signed up. The only change from the assembly announcement was that the boys were transferred completely to Whitney. While the faculty and staff at Whitney had to make some adjustments to accommodate the boys, the program change worked well. The boys did have to undergo some questions from peers, some of whom didn't believe they actually attended Whitney (the most common response was \\"you mean, Whitmer?\\" -- Whitmer being another co-ed high school in the metro Toledo area. And, even after the former Macomber boys were completely and fully registered as Whitney students, the school newspaper (Whit-Miss) and the yearbook (First Lady) kept their original names from when Whitney was a girls-only school. The Lady Macs were members of the Toledo City League and donned the colors of black and gold. Prior to their affiliation with Macomber, their school colors were green and white, but they did not compete against other schools in athletics. They only won two league titles: one for track & field in 1987 and one for basketball in the 1990-91 season. Due to a declining enrollment and low finances, Macomber and Whitney were closed along with DeVilbiss High School by TPS at the end of the 1990-1991 school year. After holding various adult education classes beyond its use as a traditional high school building, the Whitney building was demolished in 2011 by Toledo Public Schools.

Following the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, the Catholic Taaffe remained loyal to the authorities in Dublin. He later joined the Irish Confederates, and was awarded command of the Munster Army. Taaffe was a supporter of the moderate faction, and strongly supported an alliance between the Confederates and Irish Royalists. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Taaffe accompanied Charles II in exile. Following the Restoration, he was created 1st Earl of Carlingford. Biography Theobald was the eldest of Sir John Taaffe's, 1st Viscount Taaffe of Corren, fifteen children. His mother was Anne Dillon, daughter of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon. Theobald succeeded his father to the viscountcy in 1642. He represented County Sligo in the Parliament of Ireland from 1639 until his elevation to the peerage. Theobald Taaffe was appointed to lead the Irish Munster army by Donagh MacCarthy, Viscount Muskerry in 1647. He was not an impressive commander, failing to prevent the sack of Cashel and then leading the Munster army to defeat at the battle of Knocknanauss in 1647. He had an antiquated sense of chivalry - before Knocknanuss he suggested to Baron Inchiquin, the enemy general, that the battle should be decided by 1000 hand picked men from each side. Inchiquin's reply was sarcastic: you have performed as much as I desire in bringing your army hither, I shall not desire you to lose any advantage you have in numbers of men, being your offer was only made for recreation. As fate would have it, Taaffe and Inchiquin fought on the same side at the Battle of Arklow two years later. Unfortunately for Taaffe, Inchiquin lost this time. With the defeat of the Royalist cause in Ireland, Taaffe went into exile with Charles II. He was the ninth on the list of people excluded from pardon in the Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 as leaders of the Royalist forces in Ireland. Following the Restoration of Charles II, he was created Earl of Carlingford. He was sent on missions to the Duke of Lorraine and to the Holy Roman Emperor, by which was established the connection of his family with the house of Habsburg and Lorraine, which continued to the end of the Habsburg monarchy. Critics said that he had no qualifications for the position except a capacity for drink. He was married twice, firstly to Mary Weld, daughter of Humphrey Weld (of Lulworth), by whom he had a son, The Hon. John Taaffe, who married Rose Lambart, and secondly to Anne Pershall, without issue. He also had a daughter by Lucy Walter named Mary Crofts (The Hague, 1651‚Äì1693), whose father some sources claim to have been Theobald Taaffe, 1st Earl of CarlingfordRobin Clifton, 'Walter, Lucy (1630?‚Äì1658)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004Evans, Richard K.

An apse chapel or apsidal chapel is a chapel in traditional Christian church architecture, which radiates tangentially from one of the bays or divisions of the apse. It is reached generally by a semicircular passageway, or ambulatory, exteriorly to the walls or piers of the apse. Features In plan, the normal type of the tangential chapel is semicircular; some, however, are pentagonal, and some composed of a small circle, serving as cililhoir, and part of a large circle, as nave; some are oblong with eastern apses. In England, sometimes an ambulatory connects the north and south aisles of the choir and from the ambulatory projects an eastern chapel or chapels. The eastern chevet of Westminster Abbey, surrounded by five apsidal chapels, is the only complete example of this feature in England. The common source of the ambulatory and radiating chapels seems to have been the church of St. Martin of Tours, where originally there was a choir of two bays, and an apse of five bays, surrounded by a single ambulatory and five radiating chapels. Altars, which had before cumbered the nave, could now be placed in the new radiating chapels of the ambulatory, which afforded the necessary access to them. Each apsidal chapel could be treated as a sanctuary, to be entered only by the officiating, priest and his attendants, and the ambulatory served as the necessary nave for the worshippers. The usual number of these radiating chapels is three. Apse chapels are often found in the cathedrals of the Benedictine foundations, and occasionally in those of the Cluniac reform. St. Martin of Tours, St. Savin, and Cluny have five choir chapels; Amiens, Beauvais Cologne, and Le Mans have seven apsidal chapels. No ambulatory with tangential chapels is older than about 900. The peri-apsidal plan of Westminster Abbey, commenced in 1050 by Edward the Confessor, anticipated Cluny by thirty-nine years, a plan which was reproduced at Gloucester in 1089 and at Norwich in 1096. Radiating chapels are almost entirely a continental plan and most frequently found in French and Gothic structures. In England, the apse chapel is very rare, owing to the generally square termination of the nave. Traces of an early apsidal treatment are found in Canterbury Cathedral. In continental churches the central apse chapel was often the Lady-chapel, which in England was generally placed at the side.

It is not to be confused with the place of birth or place of residence, although two or all three of these locations may be identical depending on the person's circumstances.  Acquisition of municipal citizenship  Front of a 1918 Zollikofen (Bern) Heimatschein municipal citizenship certificate. Swiss citizenship has three tiers. For a person applying to naturalise as a Swiss citizen, these tiers are as follows: *Municipal citizenship, granted by the place of residence after fulfilling several preconditions, such as sufficient knowledge of the local language, integration into local society, and a minimum number of years lived in said municipality. *Cantonal (state) citizenship, for which a Swiss municipal citizenship is required. This requires a certain number of years lived in said canton. *Country citizenship, for which both of the above are required, also requires a certain number of years lived in Switzerland (except for people married to a Swiss citizen, who may obtain simplified naturalisation without having to reside in Switzerland), and involves a criminal background check. The last two kinds of citizenship are a mere formality, while municipal citizenship is the most significant step in becoming a Swiss citizen. However, any Swiss citizen can apply for a second, a third or even more municipal citizenships for prestige reasons or to show their connection to the place they currently live - and thus have several places of origin. As the legal significance of the place of origin has waned (see below), Swiss citizens can often apply for municipal citizenship for no more than 100 Swiss francs after having lived in the same municipality for one or two years. In the past, it was common to have to pay between 2,000 and 4,000 Swiss francs as a citizenship fee, because of the financial obligations incumbent on the municipality to grant the citizenship. A child born to two Swiss parents is automatically granted the citizenship of the parent whose last name they hold, so the child gets either the mother's or the father's place of origin. A child born to one Swiss parent and one foreign parent acquires the citizenship, and thus the place of origin, of the Swiss parent.Article 4, Federal Law on the Acquisition and the Loss of Swiss Citizenship (\\"Bundesgesetz √ºber Erwerb und Verlust des Schweizer B√ºrgerrechts\\")  International confusion  Almost uniquely in the world (with the exception of Japan, which lists one's Registered Domicile; and Sweden, which lists the mother's place of domicile as place of birth), the Swiss identity card, passport and driving licence do not show the holder's birthplace, but only their place of origin. The vast majority of countries show the holder's actual birthplace on identity documents. This can lead to administrative issues for Swiss citizens abroad when asked to demonstrate their actual place of birth, as no such information exists on any official Swiss identification documents. Only a minority of Swiss citizens have a place of origin identical to their birthplace. More confusion comes into play through the fact that people can have more than one place of origin.  Significance and history  A citizen of a municipality does not enjoy a larger set of rights than a non-citizen of the same municipality. To vote in communal, cantonal or national matters, only the current place of residence matters - or in the case of citizens abroad, the last Swiss place of residence. The law previously required that a citizen's place of origin continued to bear all their social welfare costs for two years after the citizen moved away. In 2012, the National Council voted by 151 to 9 votes to abolish this law. The place of domicile is now the sole payer of welfare costs. In 1923, 1937, 1959 and 1967, more cantons signed treaties that assured that the place of domicile had to pay welfare costs instead of the place of origin, reflecting the fact that fewer and fewer people lived in their place of origin (1860: 59%, in 1910: 34%).Historical Dictionary of Switzerland, entry \\"F√ºrsorge\\" (welfare) In 1681, the Tagsatzung - the then Swiss parliament - decided that beggars should be deported to their place of origin, especially if they were insufficiently cared for by their residential community. In the 19th century, Swiss authorities even offered free emigration to the United States if the Swiss citizen consented to losing the place of origin, and thus his or her right to receive welfare.

Early life A member of the Baring banking family, \\"Ned\\" Baring was born on 13 April 1828. He was the second son of Henry Baring from his second marriage, to Cecilia Anne (n√©e Windham). His younger brother was Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer. His father, a Member of Parliament for Bossiney and Colchester, was divorced from Maria Matilda Bingham, a daughter of U.S. Senator William Bingham, the former wife of French aristocrat James Alexander, Comte de Tilly. From his father's first marriage, his elder half- brother was Henry Bingham Baring, an MP Callington who married Lady Augusta Brudenell, a daughter of Robert Brudenell, 6th Earl of Cardigan. Sir Francis Baring, 1st Baronet was his grandfather and among his extended family were uncles were Sir Thomas Baring, 2nd Baronet and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton (who married Ann, another Bingham daughter). He was educated at Rugby School in Warwickshire. Career Baring in 1882 became senior partner in the family banking firm of Baring Brothers and Co until forced to step down following the Panic of 1890.

For electoral purposes it forms part of Glinton and Wittering ward in North West Cambridgeshire constituency. Thornhaugh (or Thornhaw) is derived from Old English and means a thorn enclosed low-lying meadow beside a stream. There is evidence of a settlement here as far back as the 12th century, but probably has earlier origins. Although the village of Thornhaugh itself is quite small, the parish is one of the largest in the county of Cambridgeshire at . The parish is crossed by the A1 and A47 roads. The village was declared a conservation area in 1979. The road that runs through the village is Russell Hill, named after William Russell, 1st Baron Russell of Thornhaugh who lived here. The Russell family are also associated with the Bedford Estate in Central London where you will find Thornhaugh Street and Russell Square in Bloomsbury. Parish Church of St Andrew, Thornhaugh St Andrew's Church dates from the 12th century, although much restored in the 19th century; it is a Grade I listed building. The village sign commemorates the first Baron Russell of Thornhaugh. Although the main village is close to the A1 road, there is a significant hamlet (Home Farm, Leicester Road, Thornhaugh) with a dozen houses about one mile west of the main village just off the A47 road, consisting of an old hunting lodge (now two houses) and associated farm buildings (all now residential). The Sacrewell Farm and Country Centre is in the parish, to the east of the A1. Sacrewell is named after a \\"Sacred Well\\" in Sacrewell field near Sacrewell Lodge. Some sort of mill probably existed here since the Roman occupation. Excavations have found two Roman villas, a corn drier and storage building - an ideal site being adjacent to Ermine Street and next to a spring. Three mills in the area were mentioned in the Domesday book, and it is likely that Sacrewell was one of them. A new watermill, mill house and farm were completed in 1755 and was originally called Curtis‚Äôs farm after William Curtis who died in 1779. William Scott Abbott became a tenant at the farm during the First World War and expanded the farm operations. After his death his widow Mary carried on following her husband‚Äôs dream. Her nephew David Powell took over the management of the farm in 1959 and in 1964 Mary founded The William Scott Abbott Trust. The vision was to provide an agricultural education for all and the educational values they promoted are still very much alive. The watermill remained a working mill until 1965, when it was no longer profitable, however, it has now been fully restored as a heritage working mill; a centre of milling excellence and an educational tool with a ¬£1.4 million Heritage Lottery Fund grant.\\"First look at restored mill at Sacrewell\\" Peterborough Telegraph 26 July 2015 Sacrewell visitor centre was opened to the public in 1981 and the farm and watermill are now successful visitor attractions. Russell Hill Within the parish of Thornhaugh is Bedford Purlieus National Nature Reserve, an historic woodland of 520 acres and part of what was the ancient Royal Forest of Rockingham. Up to the mid 1600s it was known as Thornhaugh Woods or The High wood of Thornhaw. The name changed when the Dukes of Bedford took ownership renaming it Bedford Purlieus. English Nature declared the wood a National Nature Reserve in 2000, in recognition of its importance as a species-rich semi-natural native woodland. The wood is the most ecologically diverse wood in Britain and home to more plant and insect species than most other woods in this country. Muntjac and fallow deer are found on the reserve, and bird life includes nightingale, red kite, sparrowhawk, kestrel, little owl, tawny owl and long-eared owl. Reptiles at the site include adders, grass snakes, common lizards and slow worms. Bedford Purlieus is managed by English Nature and Forest Enterprise in partnership and is open to the public during daylight hours. There is significant confirmation of Roman industrial occupation within the wood with many iron ore extraction pits and evidence of a bath house. It was featured on series 17 of television‚Äôs Time Team in 2011. During the Second World War, Bedford Purlieus was used as part of RAF Kings Cliffe for airmen‚Äôs living accommodation which were dispersed around the woods to reduce the risk of being hit in the event of an air raid. Various foundations still remain. Buildings within Leedsgate Farm (private property) included the theatre, gym and chapel for the airbase.

The need to establish rules of origin stems from the fact that the implementation of trade policy measures, such as tariffs, quotas, trade remedies, in various cases, depends on the country of origin of the product at hand. Rules of origin have become a challenging topic in international trade, not only because they constitute a highly technical area of rule-making, but also because their designation and application have not been harmonized across the world. The lack of harmony is even more remarkable in the era of regionalism, when more and more free trade agreements (FTAs) are concluded, creating the spaghetti bowl effect. Sample Table of Content of the Annex on Rules of Origin in an FTA  Definition of rules of origin  The most comprehensive definition for rules of origin is found in the International Convention on the Simplification and Harmonization of Customs procedures (Kyoto Convention), which entered into force in 1974 and was revised in 1999. According to Specific Annex K of this Convention: The definition makes it clear that rules of origin are basically the \\"criteria\\" to determine the origin of goods. Such criteria may be developed from principles in national legislation or international treaties, but the implementation of rules of origin (i.e., certification and verification) is always at the country level. It is also important to note that the purpose of rules of origin is to define the country of origin, not a geographical area such as region or province (which is very important in the field of intellectual property rights). The country of origin is often found in the label or marking of a good, for instance \\"product of China\\", \\"made in Italy\\", etc. Considering the modest number of Members of the World Customs Organization (WCO) acceding to Specific Annex K (accession to Specific Annexes is optional), the Kyoto Convention has a rather insignificant impact on the application of rules of origin in international trade. However, this Convention does provide many important definitions and standards, which serve as a harmonized basis for national laws and trade agreements to formulate origin. Apart from the definition for rules of origin, it also provides definitions for \\"country of origin\\", \\"substantial transformation\\", and a number of recommended practices.  Classification of rules of origin  Rules of origin can be classified into non-preferential rules of origin and preferential rules of origin. Non- preferential rules of origin are those primarily designated in order to sustain the most-favored-treatment (MFN) within the World Trade Organization (WTO). Whereas, preferential rules of origin are those associated with \\"contractual or autonomous trade regimes leading to the granting of tariff preferences going beyond\\" the MFN application. This separation is stipulated in Article 1 of the WTO's Agreement on Rules of Origin. It is important to understand the difference between these two categories of rules of origin. Non-preferential rules of origin are deemed \\"non-preferential\\" because they are applied in a non-preferential basis to determine the country of origin for certain purposes of application within the multilateral trading system. In contrast, rules of origin in FTAs and in the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is considered preferential because they help to determine the country of origin in order to grant preferential and special treatment to products originating in a contracting party or a beneficiary country. In principle, FTAs as well as their rules of origin must be notified to the WTO as an obligation of Members. However, rules of origin in FTAs and autonomous trade regimes (e.g., GSP schemes) are not subject to any substantive requirement from the WTO. This is because the Agreement on Rules of Origin does not govern how rules of origin in an FTA or a GSP scheme should be formulated and implemented. There is only a brief Common Declaration with Regard to Preferential Rules of Origin, which sets out some standards and recommendations for the formulation of preferential rules of origin. The fact that preferential rules of origin do not fall within the realm of the WTO adds more divergence to the \\"spaghetti bowl\\" of rules of origin: each FTA and each autonomous trade regime may formulate its own rules of origin. As a consequence of the rapid growth of regionalism, hundreds of rules of origin are currently applied in hundreds of FTAs. According to the WTO, as of 4 January 2019, 291 RTAs are in force - counting only those notified to its Secretariat. Whereas, according to the International Trade Centre (ITC), more than 440 FTAs are in force up to the end of March 2019. Indeed, within the WTO, non-preferential rules of origin are not more harmonized than in FTAs. Despite tremendous effort, the work program to harmonize non-preferential rules of origin has not made significant progress to date, which means there is not yet a common set of rules of origin for non-preferential purposes within the WTO. During the so-called \\"transitional period\\", the formulation and implementation of non-preferential rules are literally at the discretion of Members. The only difference as compared to preferential rules of origin is that non-preferential rules of origin are subject to more binding requirements in WTO agreements, particularly the Agreement on Rules of Origin and the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. So far, the most successful initiative to harmonize this area of rule-making at the multilateral level is the WTO's implementation of preferential rules of origin in favor of least developed countries (LDCs). The 2015 Nairobi Decision on Preferential Rules of Origin for LDCs, which is built upon the decision adopted earlier in 2013 at the Hong Kong Ministerial Conference, has for the first time laid out general guidelines and detailed instructions on specific issues to determine the status of products originating in an LDC country. Moreover, preference- granting Members are required to notify to the Secretariat of their prevalent origin criteria and other origin requirements. To enable transparency and comparability, such notifications must also follow a template adopted by the WTO's Committee on Rules of Origin.  The role of rules of origin in international trade  Being the criteria to determine the economic nationality of goods, the role of rules of origin is inherently derived from the fact that a number of trade policy measures are applied based on the source of the imports. For instance, if country A wants to impose anti-dumping duties on steel products originating from country B, it is when rules of origin come into play. Without rules of origin, country A cannot apply this measure properly because it cannot determine whether or not the steel in a certain consignment is \\"made in country B\\". Beyond this fundamental issue, when steel products originating from country C only transit through country B, they should not be subject to this trade remedy measure; but when steel products of country B opt to transit through country C before being entering country A, it should be considered a circumvention of the anti-dumping duties. All these issues give rise to the need to formulate and implement rules of origin. Basically, rules of origin allow the application of trade measures to the right subject-matters whenever their nationality is taken into account. Likewise, rules of origin are crucial to trade statistics because a country may need to keep track of their trade balance with partners. Rules of origin are particularly important in FTAs, which are established to provide preferences exclusively to products of preferential origin. In this context, rules of origin are indispensable to differentiate between goods originating in contracting parties and those originating in third countries. Such differentiation serves two purposes: (1) it allows the importing party to determine whether a product is eligible for preferential treatment under the FTA at hand; (2) it avoids the scenario where exports from third countries enter the FTA via the member with the lowest external tariff (i.e., trade deflection). This explains why in a customs union, there is no need to establish rules of origin among its contracting parties - members of a customs union are required to maintain a common external tariff imposed on imports from third countries. Due to such role, rules of origin also help to create trade among members of a preferential trade arrangement. Such trade creation effect may happen through two channels. Firstly, because preferences are destined exclusively for goods originating in partner countries, it follows that one party tends to increase its imports from another party of an FTA. To illustrate, if country A signs an FTA with country B, due to lower duties, product X originating in country B now becomes cheaper than similar product X' originating in country C; therefore, country A has the incentive to import a higher volume of X. Secondly, inputs originating in a partner country are also preferred because they are normally considered as originating in the other party where it is incorporated in production. It means country A has the incentive to use inputs originating in country B because this will allow its products to qualify for the originating status under the FTA with country B more easily. Both channels may lead to an increased trade between country A and country B, but may also have an adverse effect on their trade with country C (i.e., trade diversion). Therefore, although rules of origin help to overcome trade deflection and encourage trade creation, it also causes trade diversion, which in many cases is not economically efficient.  Origin criteria  Rules of origin attempt to reflect the practice of trade and production. It is apparent that a product may be obtained or produced by only one country, but it can also be a product manufactured with the contribution of several countries. Therefore, the criteria to determine the origin of goods - the most important element in any set of rules of origin - are designated to reflect these two circumstances. = Wholly obtained or produced products = 'Wholly obtained' refers mainly to natural products grown, harvested etc., in a Party (country or territory) and to products made entirely from them. Normally in FTAs and GSP schemes, these products are indicated either by means of a general definition or by means of an exhaustive list. The second method is more commonly found, and it is also considered to be more transparent. Specific Annex K to the Revised Kyoto Convention provides a list of wholly obtained or produced products, which can be taken as a good example for the second method: Although the lists of wholly obtained products are more or less identical across agreements, there are yet several subtle differences. For instance, a few agreements consider animals raised in one country as wholly obtained in that country, while most agreements require them to be born and raised there. Besides, most agreements include in these list only products obtained in one single country, while some agreements also consider an article as wholly obtained if it is made entirely from inputs originating in one or more than one partner countries. = Not wholly obtained products = In the ‚Äòsubstantial transformation‚Äô criterion, ‚Äòorigin is determined by regarding as the country of origin the country where the last substantial manufacturing or processing, deemed sufficient to give a commodity its essential character, has been carried out.‚Äô In other words, once a product is made up of inputs from several countries, it obtains originating status in the country that hosts the substantial works giving it an essential character. There is a possibility that works carried out in different countries may give the product equally essential characters; in that case, the last one shall be credited. There are several methods of application to identify the fulfillment of the ‚Äòsubstantial transformation‚Äô criterion, which include rules that are based (i) on the change in tariff classification, (ii) the ad valorem percentage, or (iii) the list of specific manufacturing or processing operations. All of these interchangeable methods have certain positives and negatives, and they can be applied separately or in combination.  The 'value added' rule  This method takes into account the degree of manufacturing or processing carried out in a country by calculating the value it adds to the products. If the value added meets a certain threshold, denoted as a percentage, the manufacturing or processing shall be considered substantial or sufficient, thereby allowing the goods to acquire originating status in the country where such manufacturing or processing takes place. A rule based on the value added requirement may be expressed in one of the following tests: (i) Minimum percentage of the value added to final products (build-up or direct test): The manufacturing or processing operations carried out in the country of origin must reach a certain extent, i.e., the percentage of value they add to the final products must be equal to or exceed a given threshold, so that the latter can obtain origin there. This test requires a consideration between the value of regionally or locally created content and that of the final goods. As a result, the stringency of rules of origin would increase with the threshold for regional or domestic content. For instance, a rule requiring 40% regional value content will be more stringent than one requiring 35%. (ii) Maximum percentage of non-originating inputs (build-down or indirect test): The use of non-originating materials or components in the processing or manufacturing in the country of origin is restricted to a maximum rate. This test relies on a comparison between the value of non-originating inputs and that of the final goods. Therefore, the stringency of rules of origin would be inversely proportional to the allowance of non-originating inputs. To illustrate, a rule authorizing 60% value of final products to come from non-originating materials is more stringent than one permitting 65%.  Change of tariff classification  Among those three methods of application to express the ‚Äòsubstantial transformation‚Äô criterion, change in tariff classification is regarded by the Agreement on Rules of Origin as the primary method. In its Article 9 on the objectives and principles of harmonizing rules of origin, the Agreement on Rules of Origin divides ‚Äòsubstantial transformation‚Äô into two groups, in which ‚Äòchange in tariff classification‚Äô stands apart, while the other methods are categorized as ‚Äòsupplementary‚Äô. This Article points out that to ensure the timely completion of the harmonization work program, it ‚Äòshall be conducted on a product sector basis, as represented by various chapters or sections of the Harmonized System (HS) nomenclature.‚Äô Only where the usage of the nomenclature does not enable a proper expression of ‚Äòsubstantial transformation‚Äô shall the Technical Committee on Rules of Origin consider elaborating on ‚Äòthe use, in a supplementary or exclusive manner, of other requirements, including ad valorem percentages and/or manufacturing or processing operations.‚Äô  Specific manufacturing or processing operations  This method dictates specific production processes that may confer originating status to the goods. It requires non-originating materials to go through certain processing or manufacturing operations in a country in order for the good to be deemed originating in that country. Although the Revised Kyoto Convention has dropped this method, it is still commonly used in practice: the often cited ‚Äòfrom yarn forward‚Äô rule is a good example. As a matter of fact, this method is acknowledged by the Agreement on Rules of Origin. Article 2(a)(iii) of the agreement states that in cases where this method is used, the operations conferring origin on the goods in question need to be precisely specified.  General origin provisions  Apart from the core origin criteria, rules of origin also comprise general provisions which cover other aspects in origin determination. They are referred to as general previsions because they are applied across the board, and not specific to any product. Although there is no harmony across trade agreements, the Comparative Study on Rules of Origin of the WCO has listed the most commonly found provisions of this category. Based on this study, the following glossary is provided by the International Trade Centre as a brief guideline for enterprises.  Origin certification and verification  Certification and verification are procedural aspects of rules of origin, but they are of no less importance. Even if a product fulfills the substantive origin criteria, it will not be entitled to preferences unless it complies with the procedural requirements. The requirements regarding certification and verification are usually provided in an annexes called operational procedures, or sometimes in the chapters on customs procedures. Those annexes or chapters include a number of provisions such as retention of documents, refund of excess duties paid, minor errors, etc., which need to be taken into account if traders want to claim preferences for their goods. Most essentially, to be eligible for preferential treatment, a consignment must be accompanied by a proof of origin. The most popular form of proof of origin required in most trade agreements is a certificate of origin. Besides, there are other forms of proof of origin, for instance, a declaration of origin or an origin statement. Many agreements provide value thresholds below which proofs of origin may be waived. Regarding certification, a trader needs to know whether or not self- certification is permitted by the trade agreement under which he claims preferences. If it is permitted, the trader (either the producer, the exporter, or in some cases, the importer) only needs to fill out the information relating to the consignment on a prescribed form (if any), and declare that the goods listed therein fulfill origin criteria and other requirements. However, if self-certification is not allowed, a trader must apply for a proof of origin issued by a certifying authority, which is normally the chamber of commerce or an agency of the ministry of trade or commerce. To obtain such document, the exporter or the producer will submit various documents relating to the production or manufacturing of the goods. The competent authority will examine the documents, and pay visits to an applicant's premise to verify if necessary, and certify if the goods are compliant with the origin criteria set out in the trade agreement at hand. Regarding verification, when the consignment arrives at the port of entry in the importing country, the proof of origin will be submitted to the customs authority. To facilitate trade, sometimes a physical submission is not required - the importer or its representative may simply submit the document number and/or an electronic copy thereof. The customs' acceptance of the proof of origin will decide whether or not the consignment is entitled to preferential treatment. In case there arise some doubts, the customs authority may resort to several measures, e.g. examining the original proof or origin or verifying the information on the document and the goods actually imported. The customs may require the trader to provide more information, or even contact the issuing authority in the exporting country for further clarification.  Institutions and Rules of Origin  = Domestic institutions = Because rules of origin are implemented at the country level, it is domestic institutions which directly deal with the certification and verification procedures. The competent authorities differ from one country to another, and also vary across trade agreements.  Issuing authorities  An issuing authority may be one of the following institutions: * Chamber of commerce * Specific government authority assigned by a trade agreement and/or domestic legislation * Customs authority To cite an example, in Vietnam, goods exported to an importing country under non-preferential regime may need a non- preferential certificate of origin certified by the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The Chamber is also responsible for issuing preferential certificate of origin form A if the goods are exported to a GSP- granting country. However, if the goods are traded under an FTA, the issuing authority will be a local Office of Import and Export Administration, directly under the Ministry of Industry and Trade.  Verifying authorities  Verifying authorities are in principle the customs authorities in importing countries unless otherwise specified. The reason is that the verification of origin in the importing country must be carried out when the goods arrive at the port of entry in order to determine the (preferential) duties applied to the consignment, which falls within the realm of its customs. Particularly, in many agreements, the customs are indicated as both the certifying and the verifying authorities. = International organizations = It must be noted that international organizations are not the institutions dealing directly with traders. However, they have very important roles in forming, administering and facilitating the application of rules of origin.  World Trade Organization  The WTO is administering the Agreement on Rules of Origin. It holds committees on Rules of Origin. Although most of the work at the WTO concern non-preferential rules of origin, the current initiative on rules of origin for LDCs is an important work that the WTO is carrying on. It requires the Members which commit under the Ministerial Declarations to submit notifications regarding their rules of origin in preferential treatment for LDCs. The WTO webpage on non-preferential rules of origin provides an archive of documents relating to non-preferential rules of origin in Members. It also provide a database on preferential rules of origin notified under the LDC initiative. Besides, the WTO's new Trade Facilitation Agreement also provides new benchmarks for the customs-related aspects in implementing rules of origin. For instance, Article of this agreement provides that each member shall issue an advance ruling on the origin of goods \\"in a reasonable, time- bound manner to the applicant that has submitted a written request containing all necessary information\\".  World Customs Organization  The WCO administers many important conventions that relate to rules of origin, for instance the Revised Kyoto Convention. It also administers the Harmonized System, which is the basis to construct tariff schedules and also the basis to determine the origin of goods when the \\"tariff jump\\" rule is applied. The WCO is jointly in charge of the Technical Committee on Rules of Origin. As provided for by Article 4.2 of the WTO Agreement on Rules of Origin, \\"the Technical Committee is a WTO body, but it has operated under the auspices of the WCO as provided for under Article 4.2 of the Origin Agreement. Therefore, the WCO Council exercises its supervision over the Technical Committee with regard to administrative matters only.\\" The WCO also publishes a number of guidelines and studies on different aspects of rules of origin, which are very helpful for enterprises. For instance, the WCO Origin Compendium (2017) and the Comparative Study on Preferential Rules of Origin (version 2017).  International Trade Centre  In a joint initiative with the WCO and WTO, the International Trade Centre introduces Rules of Origin Facilitator, which provides free and user-friendly access to ITC‚Äôs database of rules of origin and origin-related documentation in hundreds of trade agreements. The Facilitator is also combined with the huge tariff and trade agreements databases that have been constructed and continuously maintained by ITC‚Äôs Market Access Map since 2006, resulting in a unique market intelligence solution enabling companies, particularly ones from developing countries, to benefit from trade agreements worldwide. The Facilitator currently contains a data for more than 230 FTAs applied by more than 190 countries as well as non- preferential regimes of the EU, the USA and Switzerland. This database is gradually expanding with the ultimate goal to cover over 400 FTAs and preferential schemes that are currently active in the world. The Rules of Origin Facilitator aims to help small and medium-sized enterprises to increase trade by taking advantage of global trade opportunities in the form of low duty rates under trade agreements. The tool can also be used by policymakers, trade negotiators, economists as well as any other users. Any user can simply look for information on origin criteria, other origin provisions, and trade documentation by entering the HS code of their product.  International Chamber of Commerce  The Rules of Origin Facilitator The ICC is not directly dealing with paperwork submitted by traders, but this the world's largest business organization, is contributing a lot to the works of chambers of commerce in countries - which means they are improving the work of issuing authorities. Following the 1923 Geneva Convention, governments have been delegating the issuance of certificate of origin to chambers. Chambers are deemed to be competent organisations and regarded as an accountable and reliable third-party with neutrality and impartiality. The ICC's World Chambers Federation Council on International Certificate of Origin (ICO) was established to enhance and promote the unique position of chambers as the natural agent in the issuance of trade documents. The Federation has established a universal set of procedures for issuing and attesting certificates by chambers all over the world.

He competed in Southeastern regional promotions and the National Wrestling Alliance during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. A mainstay of NWA Mid-America (later the Continental Wrestling Association), he served as a mentor to Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler and The Fabulous Ones, among other wrestlers in the Memphis area. He was known for his blonde hair and \\"Fargo Strut\\" mannerism, and held 45 tag team championships during his career, with Don Fargo, Sonny \\"Roughhouse\\" Fargo, amongst others. Professional wrestling career Fargo's first experience with wrestling was as a teenager at the YMCA in Goldsboro, North Carolina; after he took part in the state championships, a local promoter suggested that Fargo could earn more money by switching to professional wrestling. Fargo was trained at the Quonset Auditorium in Bowling Green, Kentucky by Joe and Kenny Marshall, and first wrestled under the name \\"Wild Man Fargo\\". Fargo started his professional wrestling career around 1950 for Johnny Long in Atlanta. In 1952, Fargo wrestled in Cuba before serving in the Korean War. Fargo was a very successful tag team wrestler, having held tag team championships 45 times throughout his career. He formed a famous tag team with Don Fargo (real name Don Kalt) as the Fabulous Fargos; together they won the NWA World Tag Team titles in 1958 and dominated the National Wrestling Alliance during the late 1950s. Jackie and Don Fargo's match against Antonino Rocca and Miguel P√©rez was witnessed by a record breaking 20,125 people at Madison Square Garden on March 30, 1957. Upon ceasing his tag team with Don Fargo, Jackie Fargo formed another tag team with his real-life brother, Sonny, also known in the ring as Roughhouse; this team also enjoyed success. Jim Cornette credits Fargo with popularising wild brawls and the use of tables and chairs in wrestling in the Tennessee area, which he sees as one of the origins of the later 'hardcore' wrestling style.The Slippery Slop of Hardcore Wrestling During the 1960s, Fargo won the NWA Georgia Tag Team title with Joe Fargo and Mario Milano as well as enjoying numerous title reigns capturing the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship with Don Fargo, Lester Welch, Tex Riley, Mario Milano, Sonny Fargo, Len Rossi, Dennis Hall, Jerry Jarrett, Mr. Wrestling and the legendary Lou Thesz. Fargo was the originator of the \\"Fargo Strut\\". This charismatic walk in the ring has been copied by other professional wrestlers including Jerry Lawler, Jeff Jarrett and the Fabulous Ones. Although fellow wrestler Buddy Rogers also had a distinctive strut, Fargo claimed that he had never seen Rogers. A longtime mentor to many younger wrestlers in the Memphis area, he later became involved in a feud with former prot√©g√© Jerry Lawler who defeated Fargo in a handicap match with Jim White for the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship on March 28, 1973. Fargo later teamed with George Gulas and Tojo Yamamoto to capture the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship title several times during the early 1970s, becoming the first NWA World Six-Man Tag Team Champions along with Gulas and Dennis Hall in November 1973. In 1972, Fargo had a notorious feud with Al Greene, who once during the feud shaved off Fargo's blonde hair. Although retiring in 1980, he joined Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association to help The Fabulous Ones (Stan Lane and Steve Keirn) in their feud against The Moondogs before their departure in 1984 and retired shortly thereafter. On June 19, 2002, Fargo appeared on the first NWA-TNA Weekly pay per view along with other NWA legends. Fargo's last matches saw him wrestle both in 2004 and later 2006, at the age of 76. Personal life Fargo was hospitalized with pneumonia in both lungs in December 2011. Fargo died on June 24, 2013, after being hospitalized for a week for congestive heart failure. Fargo was survived by three daughters, one grandson, two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.

Jan≈°a is known as a pioneer of modern apiculture and a great expert in the field. He was educated as a painter, but was employed as a teacher of apiculture at the Habsburg court in Vienna.  Biography  Anton Jan≈°a was born to Slovene parents in Breznica, Carniola (now in Slovenia). His exact birth date is not known, however, he was baptised on 20 May 1734. At a young age Jan≈°a, together with his two brothers, showed a great interest in painting (they had a studio in their barn) and all three brothers, despite being illiterate, went to Vienna and entered the painters' academy there. His brother Lovro actually finished his studies at the academy and became a professor there, but Anton, despite a talent for painting, soon discovered that his true interests were in bee-keeping. His interest came early on, since his father had over one hundred hives at home and neighbouring farmers would gather at the village and discuss farming and bee-keeping. In 1769 he began to work full-time as a bee-keeper and a year later became the first royally appointed teacher of apiculture for all Austrian lands. He kept bees in the imperial gardens (Augarten) and travelled around Austria presenting his observations in regard to moving hives to various pastures. He died in Vienna.  Importance  He became famous for his lectures in which he demonstrated his knowledge of bees. He also wrote two books in German: Abhandlung vom Schw√§rmen der Bienen (Discussion on Beekeeping, 1771) and Vollst√§ndige Lehre von der Bienenzucht (A Full Guide to Beekeeping). The latter was published in 1775, after his death. In his 1775 work he noted: \\"Bees are a type of fly, hardworking, created by God to provide man with all needed honey and wax. Among all God's beings there are none so hard working and useful to man with so little attention needed for its keep as the bee.\\" The Empress Maria Theresa issued a decree after Jan≈°a's death obliging all teachers of apiculture to use his books. Jan≈°a Beehive in Breznica In beekeeping he is noted for changing the size and shape of hives to a form where they can be stacked together like blocks. As a painter he also decorated the fronts of hives with paintings. Jan≈°a rejected the belief that the male bees are water carriers and assumed that the queen is fertilized mid- air. He advocated moving hives to pastures. The Jan≈°a Beehive was preserved by Slovene beekeepers and in 1884 a plaque was put on the house where he was born. The Museum of Apiculture in Radovljica is also named after him.

Like many of the early family therapy theorists, psychoanalytic training was also the starting point for Walter Kempler; he later became interested in existential issues and family therapy. He worked for a time with Fritz Perls, and there is much overlap in their orientations. Kempler calls his form of treatment, variously, Experiential or Gestalt family therapy. His focus is on the immediate, on feelings and desires that lie behind verbal and nonverbal messages, and on their clear and complete delivery. Full engagement of family members is his immediate goal, which in turn supports his overall goal, the experience of life, its ongoing flow of union and separation. ‚ÄúNeither separateness nor union is the goal of the therapeutic process, but rather the exhortation of the endless and often painful undulation between them‚Äù. A family is made up of members who need and seek both union and separation from each other. The task of the therapist is to reconcile emerging and often conflicting personal desires, to ‚Äúarouse (remind) forgotten desires; to fire up abandoned conflict; and to keep all combatants at the front until everybody wins‚Äù. Winning, of course, does not mean that everybody is satisfied with the result, but rather, the resulting satisfaction, compromise, or loss, is fully felt, with no residuals; for example, if someone must give up a cherished fantasy about their relationship, this loss must not only be realized, but experienced and fully grieved. Experience is essential for Kempler. He sees his approach as ‚Äúoriented to an exploration of the resistances to experience‚Äù. He is quite clear in asserting that experience, action, is the key to producing change. The therapist can lead or push people toward experience, but wherever possible must not usurp the experiencing, but let the momentum created carry the participants into the intimate experience of each other, and their own desires, needs and fantasies. ‚ÄúDesire, clearly expressed and movingly delivered, brings change in its wake, sometimes through fulfillment, sometimes through the expression alone‚Äù. For Kempler, change results from confronting and fully experiencing reality in the here and now, leading to the acceptance of one‚Äôs, and other‚Äôs, continual movement toward and away from union. The Kempler Institute In 1979 the Kempler Institute were founded by the American psychiatrist and family therapist Walter Kempler MD in collaboration with child psychiatrist Morgens A. Lund, Proff. Lis Keiser and family therapist Jesper Juul with the objective of developing a long-term postgraduate education in experiential psychotherapy with families. The general office is situated in Odense and the Institute owns educational facilities in Odder, Copenhagen and a conference center on Hjarn√∏, Denmark.

Released by their original record label, Capitol Records, it marked a brief return to the label, with whom The Beach Boys released one further album, 1989's Still Cruisin'. Featuring a number of their 1960s' classics, in addition to a sampling of their later hits, Made in U.S.A. also contains two new recordings, both produced by Terry Melcher. \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\" is a Mike Love/Melcher collaboration, and \\"California Dreamin'\\" is a cover of the Mamas & the Papas' late 1965 debut single. Both were released as singles and made the U.S. pop singles chart. A slow seller, Made in U.S.A. reached No. 96 in the U.S. and ultimately went double platinum there, though with other compilations now available, Made in U.S.A. has since gone out of print. Promotional videos The first video released for Made in U.S.A. was for the single, \\"Rock 'n' Roll to the Rescue\\". The video features a common Beach Boys theme of the beach, surfboards, and cars. The video features all (then-surviving) members of the Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston) with the exception of David Marks, Blondie Chaplin, and Ricky Faatar who at the time were not active members. The second music video produced for the album was a black and white video of the song \\"California Dreamin'\\". The video is predominantly filmed at a church and features all (then-surviving) members of The Beach Boys (Brian Wilson, Carl Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, and Bruce Johnston).

He was born in the late 14th century, the son of Dolce I and Battista Orsini, and in the early 15th century inherited large possessions in the northern Latium. In 1431 he entered the service of Pope Eugene IV, warring against the Colonna. He was a fierce enemy of the Prefetti di Vico. In 1433 he fought against the troops of Niccol√≤ Piccinino and, the next year, against Francesco I Sforza. Later, with the help of Giovanni Vitelleschi, he managed to destroy forever the power of the Prefetti di Vico in northern Latium. After a failed attempt to free Vitelleschi, who was prisoner at Castel Sant'Angelo (1440), he was hired by Cardinal Ludovico Scarampi, for whom Everso fought Piccinino and Alfonso V of Aragon. During the struggle between the Papal States and Sforza, he sided with the former. In 1448 he besieged Piombino, helping Rinaldo Orsini, who was attacked by the Aragonese. The latter, anyway, hired him four years later to fight the Papal troops in the Marche, Everso being excommunicated by Pope Nicholas V. Later, during the reign of Calixtus III, he was in conflict with Napoleone Orsini, the two being pacified by the new pope Pius II. However, when the pope contested with him the possession of Vico, he sided with Piccinino and conquered Assisi, Nocera Umbra and Viterbo. He also planned to capture Rome itself during Pius' sojourn in Siena. In 1461 Everso planned to kill the Pope, but in vain. He died in his lands in 1464. Bibliography * AA.

It is situated approximately north-west from Pickering, 8 miles south-east from Castleton, and within Rosedale, part of the North York Moors National Park. History A Cistercian Priory (Rosedale Priory) once stood on the site. All that is left today is a staircase turret, a sundial and a single stone pillar. Some headstones that seem to belong to nuns have been reported, though it is unclear whether they remained in situ. Founded in 1158 or earlier, the priory was inhabited by a small group of nuns who are credited with being the first people to farm sheep commercially in the region - a quintessentially Cistercian practice driven by the order's desire to live \\"far from the concourse of men\\". Little is known of the Priory. Unlike their male counterparts in nearby Fountains or Rievaulx Abbeys, the nuns were probably not fluent writers. Furthermore, the Cistercians were famed for their hostility to women, leaving nuns aiming to follow the Cistercian life in an awkward, unofficial position, only partially connected to the rest of the Order. This is compounded by the fact that a house for nuns could not be founded, as male Cistercian abbeys were, by a party of religious being sent out from a pre-existing abbey, able to trace its filiation all the way to the mother-house at Citeaux. Because of this, it is extremely difficult to guess at what the Priory would have looked like (whereas Cistercian abbeys are highly formulaic). What stone remains is well finished and laid, but it is unclear where in the church it would have been, and what ancillary buildings might have surrounded that church. Indeed, this whole chapter of the valley's history is little understood, with only a handful of references remaining. There are records suggesting the nuns at one point had to be moved following a raid by Scots. Another record reprimands the nuns for financial mismanagement and urges them not to give away so much in aid to the poor that they bankrupt themselves. Another reprimand tells them not to allow visitors into their dormitory, while another warns them against allowing puppies into the church, lest they disturb the service. It seems from these records that there was probably a steady population of between half a dozen and a dozen nuns. The priory ceased to operate in 1536 due to the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The buildings were left to decay, with what remained eventually being dismantled in the 19th century. The stone was reclaimed all around the village - including a new church close to the priory church. but there are also suspiciously well-carved lintels built in to garden walls, and sheds with well-cut ashlar stone. Many of the buildings that exist in the village now have distinctly Gothic windows, and two of the churches at least have circular windows (a common feature of Cistercian churches, which were all dedicated to the Virgin Mary, of whom circular windows were a sign). It is unlikely that many (if any) of these stylistic details are remnants of the priory. They speak more of the Victorian sensibilities prevalent at the time the village's population soared, but may well have mimicked traditions set out by the priory. It is worth noting, too, that there is evidence that the local water- courses have been carefully managed - another common feature of Cistercian landscapes, and that there is a Grange in Rosedale (Grange being the term for a monastic farm). While it is easy to dismiss the priory as a small concern, based on the small number of nuns and lack of surviving ruins, we must remember that Fountains Abbey is unlikely to have held more than a few dozen choir monks for much of its life, so really all we can say is that Rosedale Priory could have been very small, or could have been quite big, or could have been somewhere in-between. In the 19th century an iron ore mining industry was established. The population of the valley expanded rapidly until the demise of the mines in the 1920s. The standard-gauge Rosedale Branch railway line ran round the head of the valley, serving mine workings on either side, and across the moors to reach what is now the Esk Valley Line at Battersby Junction. Community Rosedale Abbey comprises a collection of stone houses, and public houses, St Mary & St Lawrence Church, an art gallery, tea room, a sandwich shop, glass studio and a village green. Tourism in the area has developed into a major industry, with many smaller properties renovated for private holiday homes or as self-catering accommodation. Hotels, larger properties, and farms provide bed and breakfast accommodation. Recently a local parish council election attracted candidates opposed to the construction of affordable housing close to their properties. The Rosedale Show is held in the village each August, and attracts some 5,000 visitors. The show dates back to 1871 and is one of the oldest in North Yorkshire. The notoriously steep road known as Chimney Bank starts in the village. For such a small village Rosedale boasts both a football and cricket team. The football team managed by Alastair Wilkinson competes in the Ryedale Beckett League Division 1 and the Cricket Team Captained by William Sullivan competes in the Feversham League which they won in the 2019 season.

Distribution  It is found in Suriname, Mexico, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and south to Brazil, Bolivia and Argentina.  Description  The wingspan is 97‚Äì102 mm. Females are larger than males. It is a very variable species in terms of size and degree of development of the oblique lines of the forewing upperside. The costal margin of the forewing is often rather strongly convex and the apex is recurved. The abdomen has three dorsal lines, the median line is usually the most distinct but may be absent and the lateral lines are sometimes reduced to rows of dots. The forewing upperside is either with or without a dark cloud distal to discal cell. There are seven oblique lines present of which the third is the heaviest.

The larvae feed on Psychotria panamensis, Psychotria chiapensis, Psychotria psychotriifolia, Psychotria nervosa and Garrobo species. They often eat half or part of a leaf and then move to a different leaf. The first and second instars are green, changing to mottled brown or almost black at the third instar. Most feeding takes place after dusk and larvae often hide in leaf rolls or under a branch during the day. References External links *Xylophanes anubus anubus at Silkmoths.

Trinci ruled Foligno with his brothers Niccol√≤ and Bartolomeo, until their assassination by the castellan of Nocera Umbra. Corrado Trinci took his revenge by attacking the town and killing the castellan. Initially a fierce enemy of the Pope, Trinci was known for plundering monasteries. Attacked by Francesco I Sforza, however, he obtained the title of vicar of Foligno and Nocera Umbra from Pope Martin V. After this appointment, Trinci was sent to recapture Perugia, held at the time by Oddo Fortebracci. In 1428, however, he again rebelled against the Church. Peace with Rome was restored by 1435, but Trinci maintained his control of Montefalco. When Trinci favoured the rebellion of Piero Tomacelli in Spoleto, Pope Eugene IV sent Cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi to destroy him. The siege of Foligno ended in 1439, when he was betrayed by the population and taken prisoner. He died in the castle of Soriano, strangled along with his two sons.

The move landed the band a spot with AC/DC on its Back in Black tour for the entire summer. Even though Nantucket found some success, Epic Records eventually dropped the band. Drummer Kenny Soule and bassist Pee Wee Watson left in 1981, joining guitarist Michael Gardner to form rock trio PKM. They were replaced by Richard Gates and David \\"Thumbs\\" Johnson for Nantucket's fourth album. Following the band's last two studio albums, which were produced in 1983 and 1985, the group disbanded in 1990. The original members of Nantucket reunited in 1991 to record a live session and released an album called Still Live after All These Years in 1995. It featured earlier songs and new material.

Nomenclature The word is related to justice, revenge, blame, punishment and many topics central to moral philosophy, also \\"moral desert\\". In the English language, the word \\"desert\\" with this meaning tends to be a rather uncommon word colloquially; it is almost exclusively used in the phrase \\"just deserts\\" (e.g. \\"Although she was not at first arrested for the crime, she later on received her just deserts.\\"). The phrase \\"just desserts\\" is a pun on this original term and is often confused as the correct spelling of the word. In ordinary usage, to deserve is to earn or merit a reward; in philosophy, the distinction is drawn in the term desert to include the case that which one receives as one's just deserts may well be unwelcome, or a reward. For example, if one scratches off a winning lottery ticket, one may be entitled to the money, but one does not necessarily deserve it in the same way one would deserve to be paid for working for an employer, or deserve a round of applause for performing a solo. Formulation Desert claims may be generally expressed as: Thing X deserves Y in virtue of Z. For example, I (X) deserve a good grade on my test (Y) because I studied hard (Z); Cincinnati (X) deserves to be praised (Y) because it is a pretty city (Z). Some authors have added a further criterion, qualifying Z. That is, Agent X deserves Y in virtue of Z if X is responsible for Z (or, alternatively, if X is also deserving of Z). Considering this stipulation, one does not deserve respect simply because one is a human being, because one is not responsible for being a human being (Z). Arguments such as this are contentious as they suggest an untenability of intrinsic desert claims‚Äîthat is, claims wherein Z means simply to be X. Less controversially, if one (X) uses steroids to win in a footrace, one is said not to deserve to win (Y) because one is not responsible for, and so does not deserve, one's enhanced physical abilities (Z). Controversies around Rawls' dismissal of the concept of desert One of the most controversial rejections of the concept of desert was made by the political philosopher John Rawls. Rawls, writing in the mid to late twentieth century, claimed that a person cannot claim credit for being born with greater natural endowments (such as superior intelligence or athletic abilities), as it is purely the result of the \\"natural lottery\\". Therefore, that person does not morally deserve the fruits of his or her talents and/or efforts, such as a good job or a high salary. However, Rawls was careful to explain that, even though he dismissed the concept of moral Desert, people can still legitimately expect to receive the benefits of their efforts and/or talents. The distinction here lies between Desert and, in Rawls' own words, \\"Legitimate Expectations\\".See Rawls, John (1972), A Theory of Justice, Oxford: Oxford University Press Rawls' remarks about natural endowments provoked an often-referred response by Robert Nozick. Nozick claimed that to treat peoples' natural talents as collective assets is to contradict the very basis of the deontological liberalism Rawls wishes to defend, i.e. respect for the individual and the distinction between persons.Nozick, Robert (1974), Anarchy, State, and Utopia, New York: Basic Books, p. 228 Nozick argued that Rawls' suggestion that not only natural talents but also virtues of character are undeserved aspects of ourselves for which we cannot take credit, \\"can succeed in blocking the introduction of a person's autonomous choices and actions (and their results) only by attributing everything noteworthy about the person completely to certain sorts of 'external' factors. So denigrating a person's autonomy and prime responsibility for his actions is a risky line to take for a theory that otherwise wishes to buttress the dignity and self-respect of autonomous beings.\\"Nozick, Robert (1974), Anarchy, State, and Utopia, New York: Basic Books, p. 214 Nozick's critique has been interpreted in different ways. The conventional understanding of it is as a libertarian assessment of procedural justice, which maintains that while it might be true that people's actions are wholly or partly determined by factors that are morally arbitrary, this is irrelevant to assignments of distributive shares.Levine, Andrew (1999), \\"Rewarding Effort\\", The Journal of Political Philosophy 7: 404-418, at p. 406f. Individuals are self-owners with inviolable rights in their bodies and talents, and they have the freedom to take advantage of these regardless of whether the self-owned properties are theirs for reasons that are morally arbitrary or not. Others have suggested that Rawls has entirely mistaken the very logic of desert.Zuckert, Michael (1981) Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' \\"A Theory of Justice\\", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483 If justice is getting what one is due, then the basis of desert must ultimately be undeserved. However, desert is a relational concept that expresses a relationship between a deserved and a basis of desert. It simply destroys the character of desert to demand, as Rawls does, that the basis of desert be itself deserved. For example, if we say a man deserves some primary good because of some quality or action \\"Y\\", we can always ask, as Rawls does, \\"but does he deserve 'Y'?\\" and so on. We then either have an infinite regress of bases of desert or arrive at some basis, some beginning point, which the individual cannot claim to have deserved or to be responsible for, but only to have or have been given by nature. After all, no human being exists causa sui; even to reduce the basis of claims to the very narrow one of life itself reveals Rawls' difficulty: surely no one can \\"deserve\\" or \\"claim credit for\\" their own existence. To demand, as Rawls does, that no just claim rest on an undeserved base simply means that we must cease speaking about justice, for on the basis of that demand there can never be any just claims - not even for equality. Rawls' analysis of justice rests on a notion of desert which violates the concept of desert and therefore does not provide a more precise notion of the bases of desert, but rather dissolves entirely the concept of desert and with it justice. The many debates over justice in political life and in philosophy concern the actual substantive question of what are the proper bases of desert. That is, underlying every conception of justice must be a claim of right, a positive claim of desert. The great failing of Rawls' argument is that he provides no substantive basis for a claim right or desert; but this failing is, paradoxically, also the source of the great appeal or excitement about Rawls' theory. His approach seems to avoid the difficulties of the traditional debates and the value questions they necessarily raise and yet seems to enable him to discuss normative questions such as justice.Zuckert, Michael (1981), Justice deserted: a critique of Rawls' \\"A Theory of Justice\\", Polity, Volume 13, Issue 3, Pages 466-483 Jean Hampton Another, more unconventional interpretation of Nozick's critique is proposed by Jean Hampton. She points out that there seems to be a subterranean assumption in Nozick's rejection of Rawls' account of natural endowments as collective assets. This assumption is the idea that the choices individuals make regarding how they will use their labor and their property are ones for which they should be held responsible. People who do not work hard and invest imprudently should be held responsible for those choices and not receive assistance from an egalitarian welfare state. If they do work hard and invest well however, they should also be held responsible for those choices and allowed to reap the benefits from their strivings. Hampton asks the question \\"whether the ground of Nozick's conception of absolute rights is not only a conception of liberty but also a conception of moral responsibility that is [‚Ä¶] closely associated to our notion of liberty.\\"Hampton, Jean (1997), Political Philosophy, Oxford: Westview Press, p. 150 There are other political philosophers who endorse the position Hampton outlines. Their main observation is that sometimes people who are badly off might be so because of their own irresponsible conduct, and the charge is that theories favoring policies of redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor ignore this crucial point, i.e. that people might be unequally deserving because of their actions.Cf. Kekes, John (1997) Against Liberalism, New York: Cornell University Press, p. 132f. Consequences Sometimes the claim is that the redistributive systems often favored by egalitarian political theorists might have disastrous consequences in that they promote sloth and allow free riding on the productive by the lazy. These arguments are instrumental in their appeal to undeservingness. They refer to the allegedly bad consequences of a redistributive social system and do not necessarily involve any reference to the moral worthiness of those who make greater efforts, wiser investments, and so on. At other times however, the argument invokes a moral ideal holding desert valuable for its own sake. On this view, helping the undeserving and failing to help the deserving is deemed intrinsically unfair regardless of further consequences.Cf. Arneson, Richard J. (1997), \\"Egalitarianism and the Undeserving Poor\\", The Journal of Political Philosophy 5: 327-350, at pp. 330f. For example, the charge against Rawls is that people actually might deserve the gains flowing from their natural endowments, or at least those they achieve by striving conscientiously.Cf. Kernohan, Andrew (1993), \\"Desert and Self-Ownership\\", Journal of Value Inquiry 27: 197-202, at p. 202 See also *Affirmative action *Development case *Elitism *Just world hypothesis *Legacy preferences *Nepotism *Old money *Victim blaming References External links * Category:Concepts in ethics Category:Justice ","title":"Desert (philosophy)"},{"id":"10791406","text":"Maalikapurathamma is the goddess who is worshipped in a subsidiary shrine at Sabarimala Ayyappa Temple.

He was among the early scholars providing a rigorous and thoughtful account of the nature of addiction. Lindesmith's interest in drugs began at the University of Chicago, where he was trained in social psychology by Herbert Blumer and Edwin Sutherland, earning his doctorate in 1937. His education there was a mixture of the analytical and theoretical, a balance that would later appear in his drug studies. The work at Chicago involved research with interactionist theory, including the research of Chicago's Herbert Blumer, emphasizing the idea of self-concept in human interaction. Theory of addiction Lindesmith's work on drugs began with his questioning of the nature of addiction in a 1938 essay entitled \\"A sociological theory of drug addiction\\". This paper appeared in the American Journal of Sociology and involved in-depth interviews with 50 so-called addicts. As this work progressed, it developed into a full theoretical and empirical account of the nature of opiate addiction, culminating in his book Opiate Addictions in 1947 (republished as Addiction and Opiates in 1968). What Lindesmith developed was an account of opiate addiction that (1) distinguished between the physical reactions of narcotic withdrawal and its psychological (phenomenological) experience, and (2) described the relationship between these two phenomena and addiction. Addressing the question of why regular users of opiates do not necessarily become dependent or addicted, he found that, while continuous opiate use does cause many to experience physical withdrawal, the impact of withdrawal on the likelihood of dependence and addiction is not certain. Lindesmith's \\"addicts\\" revealed this, in part, as did general reports from individuals who, despite regular use of opiates, failed to become habitual users, stressing \\"the advantage of attributing the origin of addiction, not to a single event, but to a series of events, thus implying that addiction is established in a learning process extending over a period of time.\\" This learning process has two parts. First, opiate users must connect their drug withdrawal to their use of the drug, which is something that individuals exposed to opiates in hospital settings are more likely to do. When withdrawal is interpreted as a form of addiction, the perceived (and felt) need for more drugs grows. More recent research has shown that, because hospital patients often associate opiate analgesia with an illness and/or hospital care, and because the drugs cause sedation and other mind-altering effects, patients rarely experience any withdrawal. Here is the second part of the equation: if and when an opiate user identifies opiate withdrawal as such, he or she must initiate a ritual activity that is a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral mixture. As Richard DeGrandpre writes in The Cult of Pharmacology,R. DeGrandpre, The Cult of Pharmacology: How America Became the World's Most Troubled Drug Culture. Durham: Duke University Press (2006). \\"the opiate user must first experience withdrawal (a physical phenomenon), he or she must develop a concern over the withdrawal experience as such (a cognitive phenomenon), and then he or she must engage in drug use, taking opiates repeatedly to eliminate or avoid opiate withdrawal (a behavioral phenomenon). A breakdown in any part of this bio-psycho-social circuit can keep a pattern of dependent opiate use from emerging.\\" In Robert Scharse's study of Mexican- American users, for example, some interpreted withdrawal as a sign of emerging drug dependence, and subsequently reduced or quit their drug use. For others, the withdrawal experience caused an obsession over the prospect of withdrawal, encouraging them to repeatedly use in order to avoid it. This then completed a circuit, with Lindesmith's learning process being reinforced and strengthened. As his career ended, Lindesmith held on to his belief that opiate addiction is not the simple product of one's exposure to opiates. Rather it is the result of a dramatic shift in a person's mental and motivational state. Once the individual concludes that he or she is hooked, it rarely occurs to them that they are engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy, trapped within a belief that makes the experience exactly what it is feared to be. While Lindesmith's theory retains its canonical importance, it has been subject to several serious critiques. Lindesmith's theory of opiate addiction cannot explain relapse after physiological withdrawal symptoms have ceased and, more fundamentally, it relies on an outdated division of human perception into: (1) brute biological sensations the body passively experiences in immediate response to its physical environment, and (2) the mind's active and deliberate interpretation of those sensations. In short, Lindesmith's reliance on Herbert Blumer's voluntaristic understanding of meaning and interpretation profoundly undermined his capacity to theorize addiction as a loss of self-control, or as something suffered rather than chosen (Weinberg 1997).Weinberg, Darin. 1997. \\"Lindesmith on Addiction: A Critical History of a Classic Theory.\\" Sociological Theory. 15(2): 150‚Äì161 For a debate of this critique see (Galliher 1998,Galliher, John. 1998. \\"Comment on Weinberg's 'Lindesmith on Addiction'.\\" Sociological Theory. 16(2): 205‚Äì206 Weinberg 1998Weinberg, Darin. 1998. \\"Praxis and Addiction: A Reply to Galliher.\\" Sociological Theory. 16(2): 207‚Äì208). War on drugs The fact that Lindesmith's work threatened the emerging demonization of heroin, etc., is clear from how the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN)‚Äîpredecessor of the DEA‚Äîworked to discredit him. This is outlined in a paper by Galliher, Keys, and Elsner, \\"Lindesmith v. Anslinger: An Early Government Victory in the Failed War on Drugs\\".John F. Galliher, David P. Keys, Michael Elsner, \\"Lindesmith v. Anslinger: An Early Government Victory in the Failed War on Drugs.\\" The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology, Vol. 88, No. 2 (Winter, 1998), pp. 661‚Äì682 As early as 1939, FBN director Harry Anslinger had the Chicago District Supervisor of the Bureau notify Indiana University that one of their professors was a drug addict. An internal FBN memo also suggests that, some years later, a wire tap may have been placed on Lindesmith's phone by the Bureau. Incidentally, there is no evidence that Lindesmith ever used illegal drugs. As Galliher et al. point out, \\"the targeting of Lindesmith was possible because Lindesmith acted virtually alone in standing up against federal drug control policies.\\" In his book The Addict and the Law,A.R. Lindesmith, The Addict and the Law. Bloomington: Indiana University Press (1965). Lindesmith presents a detailed account of U.S. laws, regulations, police practices and court procedures, often in painful detail. He was describing what we now know as the beginning of the \\"war on drugs\\", although that term was not coined until 1971. It was published just 3 years after Anslinger retired. In his book, Lindesmith expressed hope that the relatively liberal drug policies of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations would continue, but that was not to be. Criticism Professor Nils Bejerot argued that Lindesmith made wrong conclusions about what caused the low abuse of opium in the late 1940s in England. Lindesmith had noticed that England in the 1940s had very liberal narcotics laws (see the Rolleston Committee Report of 1924) and low drug abuse and draw the conclusion that the liberal drug laws contributed to a low abuse of opium. Drug addiction was by the Rolleston Committee seen as a personal problem that could be treated by a family doctor. Bejerot ‚Äì who was very familiar with the discussion about drug policy in the UK and had studied epidemiology and medical statistics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 1963 ‚Äì drew the opposite conclusion. He argued instead that the low number of drug abusers in England until the 1950s was the cause of liberal drug laws in England. When the number of addicts of heroin in England doubled every sixteenth months from 1959 to 1968, the British government was forced to implement more restrictive drug laws.Nils Bejerot: Narkotika och Narkomani, 1975Rachel Lart BRITISH MEDICAL PERCEPTION FROM ROLLESTON TO BRAIN, CHANGING IMAGES OF THE ADDICT AND ADDICTION Nils Bejerot & Jonas Hartelius Missbruk och mot√•tg√§rder, 1984 Lindesmith wrote his earlier books from close personal interviews with a very limited number of addicts, about 50, almost all of them victims of therapeutic use of drugs when they were in health care for other reasons. Bejerot agreed with Lindesmith that these therapeutic addicts could be treated as personal health problems. These addicts were often ashamed of their drug abuse and the risk that they should introduce others in drug addiction was low. Bejerot claimed that persons from other, much larger, groups of drug addicts often were those that introduced others in their habit to use drugs (Bejerot studied this issue in his doctor thesis about persons who injected amphetamine). Bejerot claimed that the liberal drug laws that Lindesmith recommended ‚Äì neglecting smaller amounts of illegal drugs for personal use etc. ‚Äì therefore would open the doors for a much larger drug epidemic. Then, the society will rebound with much more restrictive laws (compare with the War on drugs).Nils Bejerot:Narkotikafr√•gan och samh√§llet, Stockholm, 1967,1969 Lindesmith himself was a careful and conservative man, never using drugs or advocating their use. Personal life Lindesmith was born in Clinton Falls Township, Steele County, Minnesota, and gained an early fluency in German from his German-born mother. He attended public school in nearby Owatonna, Minnesota, where he graduated from high school in 1923. He graduated from Carleton College in 1927 and received an M.A. in education from Columbia University in 1931. Lindesmith taught school before entering the University of Chicago, where he received his Ph.D. in 1937, writing his dissertation under the direction of Herbert Blumer. In the development of his dissertation, Lindesmith applied the tenets of symbolic interactionism, communicated to him from Blumer before that perspective even had its present name. He was a close colleague of Edwin Sutherland, who chaired the Department of Sociology at Indiana until his death in 1950 and collaborated with luminaries in symbolic interaction such as Anselm Strauss, Howard Becker, and Edwin Lemert. Lindesmith's teaching career at Indiana University spanned forty years from 1936 to 1976. He became University Professor of Sociology there in 1965. He was president of the Society for the Study of Social Problems, 1959‚Äì1960.Information in this section was drawn from Karl Schuessler, \\"Dedication to Alfred R. Lindesmith, 1905‚Äì1991,\\" in Harold Traver and Mark S.

Lindesmith married Gertrude Louise Augusta Wollaeger (1907‚Äì1985) in 1930. They had one daughter. He died in Bloomington, Indiana.

Biography  ƒåop was born in the small northern Carniolan town of ≈Ωirovnica, in what was then the Habsburg Monarchy (now in Slovenia), into a relatively wealthy peasant family. He was sent to Ljubljana for primary and secondary schooling and then studied philosophy at the lyceums of Ljubljana and Vienna for three years. In 1817, he returned from Vienna and attended a priest seminary until 1820, when he left it to become a secondary school teacher in Rijeka, Croatia. In 1822 he moved to Lvov (then also part of the Austrian Empire), when he started working as a teacher at the local lyceum, but was soon promoted to assistant professor at Lviv University. In 1827 he returned to Ljubljana, when he was offered a job as a secondary school teacher again. In 1828, he accepted the post of librarian at the Lyceum, which he held full-time after 1831. During his time in Ljubljana, be became a close friend of the poet France Pre≈°eren. He served as his tutor, providing him with information on contemporary developments in European literature. In 1835, at age 38, ƒåop drowned while swimming in the Sava River. Pre≈°eren dedicated his major poem The Baptism on the Savica to his late friend.  Influence  With his command of 19 languages (including Albanian), ƒåop was perhaps the most erudite Slovene of his time. Although he did not publish much original work during his lifetime, ƒåop had a great influence on the later development of Slovene culture. Unlike such contemporaries as the linguist Jernej Kopitar and the poet Stanko Vraz, ƒåop believed in the possibility of the development of a distinctive Slovenian national culture. He can thus be seen as the predecessor of the Slovenian national awakening in the second part of the 19th century. His broad cosmopolitan education enabled him to recognise the poetic talent of France Pre≈°eren, which remained unnoticed by most of his contemporaries, and to advise him on stylistic and linguistic issues. Today, ƒåop is generally regarded as one of the most important Slovenian intellectuals of the 19th century. Several streets, schools and other institutions throughout Slovenia bear his name, among them the fashionable ƒåop Street in Ljubljana.

It starts at Belvidere Avenue, just west of Sam Lawrence Park, and extends eastward past Mountain Drive Park on Upper Gage Avenue and ends shortly thereafter at East 43rd Street. Note: East of East 43rd Street the road is known as Mountain Brow Boulevard. History Concession Street landmark Street activity Niagara Escarpment (in red) Concession Street landmark Concession Street banner Originally known as Stone Road and changed to Concession Street in 1909. As well, the Hamilton mountain was a separate community from the Lower city Hamilton and known as \\"Mount Hamilton\\" but by 1891, properties north of Concession Street were annexed by the city of Hamilton and were serviced with water, sewers and sidewalks. Note: Aberdeen Avenue in the Lower City was originally known as Concession Street. Concession Street is the oldest settlement area on the Hamilton mountain. It was once an African American neighbourhood settled by slaves escaping the U.S. via the underground railroad Underground Railroad. This part of Hamilton Mountain was then known as \\"Little Africa\\". Canada in general and Hamilton in particular received these refugees with great sympathy and understanding. They were illiterate and took up education in the \\"Mission\\", a union church and school building, erected in 1860. The Union Mission was situated on the south-side of Concession between Twenty-Second and Twenty Third Streets. The adults would sit in with the children and spell out words and hoped that they might some day be able to read the Bible. They also liked to display pictures of Queen Victoria alongside that of Abraham Lincoln. They also took on new surnames to avoid being identified and recaptured. Many of the families there favoured the name \\"Johnson\\" as well as \\"Atkins\\", \\"Murdoch\\" and \\"Green\\". Over the years these families abandoned the homes they had established, to be seen no more on the hilltop. They didn't like the long cold winters and eventually returned to the United States. Today it is a predominantly white neighbourhood. During the 19th century it did not occur to inhabitants of Hamilton that the mountain top would become thickly populated. Concession Street had been a deer run, then a cow path, at last evolved into a stoned road and had a toll-gate placed on it. All other roads on the mountain were left in a state of nature, where wagons sank to the hubs in the sticky mud for which Barton Township was famous. From the year 1910, (interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914), a great building boom was enjoyed on the mountain area, when many farms were cut into lots and many streets opened. Immigration flowed and the newcomers were chiefly from the British Isles. They were industrious workingmen who soon built comfortable homes for themselves. When the city water came to the mountain, followed by sewers, there was no restraint on the building program. Since then the growth has been phenomenal. In 1949, Mayor Sam Lawrence went on record as favouring a separate mountain ward. The city's focus was now to grow south with the eastern boundary, at the time, now established at Red Hill Creek. =Transportation infrastructure= The Jolley Cut, (named after James Jolley, (1813‚Äì1892), saddler, harnessmaker, politician) is a mountain/lower city-access road in Hamilton. James Jolley funded construction of the Jolley Cut. It was not unusual for the mountain settler in those days to undertake the construction of a road down the face of the escarpment, known as a short- cut, which might be used only by the family who constructed it or might open to the public. At the west end they had the Fillman Mountain, the Horning Mountain and later Beckett's Drive ‚Äî all done by hand labour. Eventually both Fillman & Horning Mountains fell to disuse because they were dangerously too steep. One time the city even considered adding a streetcar route on the mountain like they had done with the lower city. (Note: When street railway lines were at its peak in Hamilton there was a total of 27.97 miles of railway lines employed by the HSR.) In 1913, promoters of the Civic Improvement Society, composed of mountain townshipmen, stated that, 'if a street railway were run on the mountain then the area would grow rapidly.' They never got their wish. They also stated at the time that 'the mountain was lacking adequate garbage collection, water supply and a sewage system'. Electric street lighting was another issue of the day as the only lighting they were getting were from city lights coming in from lower city Hamilton.Publisher: The Hamilton Spectator title: Will they come into the City? ‚Äî Movement of township side of mountain. (Jan 26, 1913)accessdate=2008-08-25 In 1924 the city of Hamilton agreed to add more street lights to the mountain in an area bounded by Fennell Avenue (south), the escarpment (north), Ontario Hospital on West 5th Street (west) and Upper Gage Avenue (east). Street lights on every second pole. In 1927 the HSR seriously considered adding a bus route on the Hamilton Mountain and taking advantage of a proposed mountain road which would extend from James Street South to a point 400 feet east of Ferguson Avenue. The road was being considered because the grade would be much smaller per cent than the Jolley Cut and cars would be able to negotiate the journey from the bottom to the top with less difficulty. Permission had to be obtained from the Department of Highways if the Hamilton buses were to pass Concession Street. The city limits in 1927 only extended as far as the sidewalk on the southside of Concession, and all of the roadways past that point would come under jurisdiction of the provincial highways department, which at the time, did not encourage competition between two bus companies when one gave adequate service. =Incline railway= When the incline railways were running tourists did not consider it a trip to Hamilton complete until they had taken the jaunt to the top of one of these railways and looked down on the enchanting scene from an elevation of 285 feet. James Street, at the base of the Niagara Escarpment (mountain) was the site of the city's first incline railway (1892‚Äì1932). Back then, the incline railway on James Street was known as the Hamilton & Barton Incline Railway. The city's second incline railway on Wentworth Street South, (1895‚Äì1936), was known as the Eastend Incline Railway but was often called, The Mount Hamilton Incline Railway. The Eastend Incline on Wentworth Street was electrically operated and the Westend Incline on James Street depended on steam for its power. In 1924, following the city's booming development in the east, there was some serious discussion regarding the addition of a third incline railway. The 2 locations be considered at the time were Sherman Avenue or Ottawa Street South. The population of Hamilton Mountain at the time was 6,000. In 1929, the city's brochures were using the motto, \\"The City Beautiful and Hub of Canadian Highways\\" as well as \\"The City of Opportunity\\". In regards to the incline railways, the brochures go on to boast, \\"There is no finer view anywhere on the North American continent than the panorama to be seen from the Hamilton mountain. The city below, the blue waters of Hamilton harbour and Lake Ontario. In the background, flanked on the east by the famous Niagara Fruit District and on the west by the beautiful Dundas Valley and a range of hills, combine to make a picture no artist could paint. There are several roads leading up to the summit and you can drive upon 'high', but if you want to enjoy a unique experience and give the family a thrill, drive your car onto one of the incline railways and you will have something to tell the folks about when you go back home.\\" In 1949 there was a petition going around town to help revive the Eastend incline, with no success. It was estimated that year 2,000 people used the Wentworth mountain stairs on a daily basis between the hours of 6 in the morning and 6 pm. Proponents of the incline argued that an elevator 'would take passengers and baby carriages to the top of Hamilton mountain and back' plus 'school children took the bus because they couldn't carry their bicycles up the steps'. The reason attributed for its closure in 1936 was the falling off in the numbers using it, due to the depression, and the depreciation of its rolling stock. Sam Lawrence Park Sam Lawrence Park, one of the parks in the City of Hamilton's Parks system, is 6 hectares (14.85 Acres) in size, and composed of three sections surrounding the Jolley Cut roadway. Located on the brow of the Niagara Escarpment, the park offers visitors views of the lower city, Hamilton harbour, and the Dundas Valley. Sam Lawrence Park can be found on the western- end of Concession Street. Prior to 1944, this property was the Webb Quarry. In February 1944, The City of Hamilton was given of land for park use by Thomas Hambly Ross, MP (Hamilton East), and his wife Olive. The park was originally named Ross Park, then renamed Patton Park in 1946, in honour of captain John MacMillan Stevenson Patton, a Hamiltonian who risked his life during World War II by detonating an unexploded bomb. For this exploit he received the first George Cross for Valour. In 1960, the park was renamed to honour Sam Lawrence. During 1990 to 1994, Sam Lawrence Park underwent a major upgrading that included repairing the stone walls, installing new walkways, site lighting, site furniture, and the redevelopment of the major rock gardens. The shelter at Sam Lawrence Park was built in 1956 on the existing foundations of the old water tank that used to service this part of the mountain. The stone walls, flower gardens, and pathways were originally constructed in the 1950s and 1960s under the direction of K. Matt Broman, the landscape architect who also supervised the development of the Rock Gardens at the Royal Botanical Gardens. Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Centre The Henderson General Hospital, now named the Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Centre, got its name in 1954 when it was named after Nora-Francis Henderson who was the first woman on Hamilton City Council and also the first city controller in Canada. She was also a journalist and activist who pushed for children's and women's rights and health care. The hospital underwent major renovations and expansion and was renamed the Juravinski Hospital and Cancer Centre, (after Charles Juravinski and his wife Margaret), after they both made a $43-million contribution to health care in Hamilton. Charles Juravinski sold Flamboro Downs racetrack (Canada's fastest half-mile harness horse racing track) in 2002 and chose to share the money with Hamilton city hospitals. The new hospital will have a Henderson wing.

The film was produced by MBB Group, Elizabeth Yoffe and Tony Zierra. Synopsis Filmed over ten years, this controversial documentary follows five roommates trying to make it in Hollywood who face the unexpected consequences of fame. Tony Zierra, an aspiring filmmaker with no money, stars or crew, resorts to filming the lives of his four struggling actor roommates. Three of the actors, Brad Rowe, Chad Lindberg and Wes Bentley quickly hit it big, while the fourth actor, Greg Fawcett, is nearly driven insane watching the others get famous. It doesn't take long for the unsettling reality of stardom to set in. Lindberg's hope of becoming a leading man is crushed when he‚Äôs repeatedly told he doesn‚Äôt have the right look; Rowe ends up typecast as a pretty boy and can't break past his uncanny resemblance to Brad Pitt; while Bentley, who has a fast career launch, is quickly drawn into the darker side of the L.A. lifestyle. As the actors struggle with life in the public eye, Zierra deals with constant obstacles while he tries to complete his film - including being scrutinized and blocked by the actors' nervous agents. Each of the subjects is tested and changed by their encounters with the film industry. The documentary ends with a follow-up Zierra filmed when he returns to Hollywood after a five- year absence to find out what happened to each of his former roommates.

Tony Zierra originally intended to shoot a fiction film but while trying to find a script and secure financing he decided to film his roommates, Wes Bentley, Chad Lindberg, Brad Rowe and Greg Fawcett, who were struggling actors. He thought that their pursuit of success in the film business would make an interesting story. At the time, in the 1990s, the concept of \\"reality\\" media was virtually unknown so Zierra's idea was considered by the actors and others in the industry to be unusual. He self- financed the production through the money he made at various jobs and by other means such as holding garage sales. Zierra ended up filming almost every aspect of his roommates' lives. He thought that it was possible that one of them might beat the odds and get some kind of break but more likely they would all end up leaving Hollywood discouraged. Whatever happened, Zierra felt that it would make for an intriguing film. However, three of the roommates ended up becoming successful quickly. Brad Rowe was cast as the love interest in Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, an independent gay-themed romantic comedy that was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival. The film launched Rowe's career, he was featured prominently on the cover of US Magazine and labeled \\"The Next Big Thing\\". Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss also launched the career of actor Sean Hayes who played the main character, Billy, in the film and went on to play Jack McFarland on the long-running television series Will & Grace. Chad Lindberg was cast in the film October Sky and in many television shows such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, ER and The X-Files. Wes Bentley won the coveted part of Ricky Fitts in the Oscar-winning film American Beauty and became an overnight sensation. Zierra, who had already been following his roommates lives before they got their break was able to capture their success on camera as it happened. Once the actors became successful, Zierra's project began to draw interest from the media and film industry insiders. However, that interest didn't immediately translate into financial backing which, as years passed, made continuing to film increasingly difficult. Additionally, the interest also brought problems as the people who handled the business end of the actors' burgeoning careers began to worry about the content of the footage that Zierra had of his roommates. The representatives of Wes Bentley at the William Morris Agency were particularly concerned. Zierra refused requests to show the footage to anyone until he had finished filming. In 2001, Zierra began to edit the 200+ hours of footage into a film titled Carving Out Our Name, a name taken from a line in the Counting Crows song Round Here. At the time, there were no non-linear editing systems that could allow independent filmmakers a way to edit their projects on a modest budget. Editing costs were exorbitant, so from week to week Zierra had to find a variety of ways to raise money to continue with post-production. He bartered, negotiated percentages of ownership in the future finished film, and borrowed on credit cards. After dealing with repeated obstacles he finally completed Carving Out Our Name with backing from his friends Alex Ebert and Tim Anderson of the band Ima Robot. Ebert and Anderson became the executive producers and wrote most of the score for the film.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0275245/ Carving emphasized the friendship among the roommates and their personal relationships with the women in their lives. The documentary was completed at a relatively high point in the actors' careers so it didn't show a full range of highs and lows in their lives. Carving was accepted into the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival and premiered on the evening of September 10, 2001. It was extremely well received by the audience of 1000 people and generated a great deal of interest from the media and potential distributors. At the film premiere afterparty, Zierra's agent, Cassian Elwes from William Morris Independent, wanted to discuss the deals that were being offered by distributors, but Zierra felt he should honor the friendship that Carving had captured over the years and just let everybody \\"enjoy themselves\\"; he decided to wait until the morning to discuss business with Elwes. The attacks on America the next day, September 11, 2001, brought everything to a halt and emotionally devastated all of the festival attendees. The Toronto International Film Festival was cancelled. Carving Out Our Name was never released due to a combination of factors, including changes in the market after the 9/11 and concerns by insiders in Hollywood that the film might have a negative impact on the actors' careers. In the early 2000s, filmmakers in Zierra's position were completely dependent on the tightly-controlled Hollywood distribution system. There were no alternatives for independent filmmakers to distribute or market their own films because online outlets didn't exist. An independent film without Hollywood backing had no chance of being seen by the audience. Zierra was extremely affected by the experience and suffered an emotional breakdown. He destroyed all copies of Carving Out Our Name, left Hollywood, and cut ties with everyone he had known there, including his former roommates. Years later, Zierra decided to take the original footage out of storage and begin editing another film that would include his own experience making Carving. By this time, editing a film had become much more cost effective because of the introduction of the user friendly and affordable non-linear editing system Final Cut Pro. Still, starting the film over from the 200+ hours was a massive undertaking. Whereas Carving focused on the success of the actors and their personal relationships, the new film, My Big Break, focuses on the ups and downs of the film business and how fame ‚Äì or the lack thereof ‚Äì affected all of them. Alex Ebert, one of the executive producers of \\"Carving Out Our Name\\" contributed to My Big Break by composing music for the film. Ebert subsequently won a Golden Globe for Best Original Score in 2014 for All Is Lost starring Robert Redford. After contacting his former roommates, Zierra shot an update with Lindberg, Rowe and Fawcett, each of whom had gone through disappointments and setbacks in the film business. Despite Zierra's repeated attempts, Bentley wasn't willing to see him and communicated only through text messages. Bentley was reputed to be struggling with severe drug addiction but Zierra couldn't verify this. Zierra ended up re-editing My Big Break numerous times. During the process he once again found himself dealing with the emotional impact of delving deeply into the story and had to put the film aside for periods of time. The ending of the film proved particularly difficult to lock down because the unresolved tensions between him and Bentley required him to construct Bentley's \\"update\\" in ways that never fully satisfied him. In 2010, Bentley came forward and admitted to the press that his sudden rise to fame had sent him into a spiral of drug addiction from which he was now recovering. Zierra felt that the story finally had closure. He cut an ending that he was satisfied with and completed the documentary. From start to finish, My Big Break took 15 years to finish. Portrayal of drug use My Big Break includes scenes of drug use as the aspiring actors and filmmaker get caught up in the negative side of the Hollywood lifestyle. The film deglamorizes what is euphemistically referred to as \\"partying\\" by showing the destructive consequences that substance abuse has on the careers and personal lives of those who become famous. In the film, Professor Mark Schaller, author of \\"The Psychological Consequences of Fame\\", discusses how celebrities often turn to the excessive use of drugs and alcohol to \\"escape the fishbowl of Hollywood\\" when they feel overwhelmed by pressure and scrutiny. Zierra decided to directly address the problem of substance abuse in Hollywood after Heath Ledger, who had been his friend, died in 2008. My Big Break is dedicated to Ledger. My Big Break and American Beauty When Zierra first began filming his roommate Wes Bentley, the young actor had recently screen tested for the coveted role of Ricky Fitts in American Beauty but hadn't yet heard if he got the part. In My Big Break, Bentley discusses the experience of screen testing and his hope that he will be cast in the movie. Once Bentley landed the part, Zierra filmed him going to the Los Angeles premiere of American Beauty before the actor had any idea how the film or his performance would be received. The filmmaker was given rare access by DreamWorks to film the premiere from the vantage point of the red carpet. Zierra subsequently filmed Bentley attending the film's premiere in Toronto as well as the media frenzy that surrounded Bentley after American Beauty became a critically acclaimed hit. My Big Break then follows Bentley through his fast rise to fame and his misgivings about the pressures of the film industry. The final cut of My Big Break incorporates Bentley's admissions to the press, a decade after American Beauty, that he became a heroin addict after his initial success and how his career is now getting back on track. Coincidentally, Ricky Fitts, the character Bentley played, became an iconic figure in popular culture because of his unusual habit of filming everything and everybody with his digital camera. At the time, the concept of people filming everything around them was strange and new. While Bentley was playing a character that represented the advent of a new digital media generation, his own life was being digitally chronicled by Zierra. My Big Break and Entourage My Big Break has repeatedly been referred to as 'a real-life Entourage', HBO's fictional series about four friends living in Hollywood. Although Tony Zierra began filming his project long before Entourage, parallels exist between the two. They're both portraits of male friendship, Hollywood, stardom, and the ups and downs of the film business. In My Big Break, Greg Fawcett's outspoken, often outrageous personality is similar to the character of Johnny Drama in Entourage. Wes Bentley and the fictional Vincent Chase have a number of striking similarities. They both gain fame quickly and were viewed as \\"potentially the best young actor of his generation\\", they both angered high- powered Hollywood insiders by their unwillingness to \\"play by the rules\\", they both ended up struggling with severe substance abuse problems and were arrested while in possession of drugs. Perhaps the most direct similarity is that Bentley had a well-known feud with mega- producer Harvey Weinstein while on Entourage Vincent Chase had a similar feud with Harvey Weingard, the fictional version of Weinstein. According to Entourage executive producer Mark Wahlberg, Entourage was originally conceived of as a documentary about him and his friends but he chose a fictional approach to keep the content more satirical. Whereas Entourage is mostly light in tone and focuses on the flashy perks of Hollywood, My Big Break is much grittier. The documentary directly takes on the darker side of celebrity and the consequences of pursuing success and fame in the film business. Screenings The 2008 cut of My Big Break screened on September 26, 2008 at EYECON (the Supernatural convention) in Florida. Other pre-2011 cuts have screened at George Washington University, Bryn Mawr College, Bennington College, The Popular Culture/American Culture Conference, Artsfest Film Festival, The American Cinematic Experience Festival, the Boston Film Festival and Raindance Film Festival in London. Reception My Big Break has received strong support and glowing reviews from its fans and in the blogosphere. The film won Best Documentary at the Boston Film Festival and Best Documentary at the Artsfest Film Festival 2009. It was also an official selection of The American Cinematic Experience Festival (Acefest) 2009, and Raindance Film Festival 2009 where it was nominated for Best Documentary. Multiple versions In order to build a buzz and test audience reaction an early cut of My Big Break was given an extremely limited release on DVD in 2008. This longer version is no longer available and did not include Wes Bentley's admission that he had been struggling with drug addiction. In 2009 a tightened cut of the documentary was shown at festivals, universities and conferences but was not made available to a wider audience. The final cut of My Big Break released, in 2011, deals directly with issues of substance abuse. It also includes a text update of what the main subjects of the documentary are doing as of the release. =Awards= *Best Documentary (Artsfest 2009) *Best Documentary (The Boston Film Festival 2009) The film was also nominated for Best Documentary at the Raindance Film Festival in London.

Venter also played for the South African national team, the Springboks. Venter made his debut for South Africa on 26 November 2000 in a Test against Wales in Cardiff, and went on to represent the Springboks 25 times. His usual position was as flanker, but he also played at lock or No 8. After retiring from professional rugby, Venter up-skilled himself within the financial sector and worked with institutions like ABSA and Old Mutual. International Retirement AJ Venter was selected for the second-string squad for the away legs of the 2007 Tri Nations Series in Australia and New Zealand as almost 20 first team players were either rested or injured. But he decided to retire from International rugby and hence withdrew from the Springboks touring squad. His retirement meant that he also missed out on a possible World Cup place with the Springboks, but he cited personal and business commitments in Durban and South Africa as his reasons for the retirement. However, he continued playing for the Sharks until the end of the 2008 Super 14 competition. Later in the year, Venter rekindled his passion for the game after a lack of game time, including a controversial exclusion from the Sharks semi-final team. He joined the Stormers (Western Province) on a short-term contract, before finally hanging up his boots. Early career In 2002, Venter, along with Richie McCaw of New Zealand, saved referee David McHugh from injury when a drunk South African fan ran onto the pitch during a 2002 Tri-Nations game between South Africa and New Zealand in Durban. McCaw wrestled the fan off the referee while Venter ran and tackled both McCaw and the fan to the ground before the rest of the players attempted to drag him off as security ran onto the field.

It was directed by Kate Blewett and Brian Woods and produced by Lauderdale Productions. It first aired on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom and in 1996, was aired on Cinemax. A follow-up film, Return to the Dying Rooms, was released in 1996. In 1996 the film won a Peabody Award. It also won a News & Documentary Emmy Award. Synopsis In the film Blewett and others travel to China to visit orphanages that they claim housed children that were abandoned as a result of the \\"one-child policy\\". The filmmakers stated that unwanted female and disabled children were left to die of neglect, which would enable the child's parents to have another child. While filming the crew used hidden cameras to collect footage and Blewett used a false name while visiting the orphanages. Reception After its release the Chinese government repudiated the documentary's claims, stating that Blewett fabricated the claims in the documentary. A rebuttal to the documentary, The Dying Rooms: A Patchwork of Lies, was also filmed. The documentary was also criticized by Irish charity Health Action Overseas. Two Irish aid coordinators for the charity traveled to China to visit the orphanages and reported that the claims in both The Dying Rooms and Return to the Dying Rooms were \\"\\"wholly exaggerated, and almost completely without substance\\".\\" In Patrick Tyler's review of Blewett's film, the New York Times stated that \\"Compelling images of neglect were captured on tape at this orphanage, and the rebuttal offered by the Government did not succeed in addressing the poor condition of the infants found on the day of the film crew's visit.\\" Walter Goodman also reviewed the film for the paper, stating that \\"Kate Blewett, Brian Woods and Peter Hugh have not made a balanced or polished documentary.

The Greek Constitution of 1911 was a major step forward in the constitutional history of Greece. Following the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos after the Goudi revolt in 1909, Venizelos set about attempting to reform the state. The main outcome of this was a major revision to the Greek Constitution of 1864. The most noteworthy amendments to the Constitution of 1864 concerning the protection of human rights, were the more effective protection of personal security, equality in tax burdens, of the right to assemble and of the inviolability of the domicile. Furthermore, the Constitution facilitated expropriation to allocate property to landless farmers, while simultaneously judicially protecting property rights. Other important changes included the institution of an Electoral Court for the settlement of election disputes stemming from the parliamentary elections, the addition of new conflicts for MPs, the re-establishment of the State Council as the highest administrative court (which, however, was constituted and operated only under the Constitution of 1927), the improvement of the protection of judicial independence and the establishment of the non- removability of public employees. Finally, for the first time, the Constitution provided for mandatory and free education for all, and declared Katharevousa (i.e. archaising \\"purified\\" Greek) as the \\"official language of the Nation\\".

He was most known for his contributions to the study of the treatment of Beriberi and Scurvy. Biography Holst was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Axel Holst (1826‚Äì80) and Anna Mathilde Charlotte Flemming (1832‚Äì97). He was the brother of the linguist Clara Holst and grandson of Frederik Holst. Both his father and grandfather were physicians. Holst attended Christiania Cathedral School (1877). He studied at Royal Frederick University (now University of Oslo) gaining his cand.med. in 1884. In 1887, he was awarded the Crown Prince's gold medal (Kronprinsens gullmedalje). He was granted his doctorate in 1892 involving the bacterium streptococcus. He was an assistant at the National Institute of Pathological Anatomy from 1885-89. During 1890-1892, he studied at various European laboratories including visits at Kiel, Berlin, Munich and Paris. He was appointed health inspector in Christiania from 1892-93. He was appointed Professor of Hygiene and Bacteriology at the University of Kristiania from 1893. He was also director of the university's newly established Hygiene Institute until his retirement in 1930. He died in Oslo during 1931 at age 70. Research Throughout his career, Holst made many other contributions, writing numerous medical books and articles related to sanitation, health and practical hygiene. Holst conducted his most notable research work with Theodor Fr√∏lich (1870-1947) who was a Professor of Pediatrics at the University. Holst and Fr√∏lich suspected a nutritional deficiency for scurvy in the Norwegian fishing fleet, then called \\"shipboard beriberi,\\" and thought to be a variant of beri-beri. Holst and Fr√∏lich established an animal model that allowed systematic study of factors that led to the ship-related dietary disease, as well as the preventive value of different substances. Axel Holst: (September 6, 1860-April 26, 1931) - Johnson 53 (1): 1 - Journal of Nutrition Substituting guinea pigs for pigeons (a traditional beriberi research model) as the experimental animal for these studies was a lucky coincidence, as the guinea pig was later shown to be among the very few mammals capable of showing scurvy-like symptoms, while pigeons, as seed-eating birds, were later shown to make their own vitamin C in the liver, and could not develop scurvy. Scurvy occurred in guinea pigs when a diet was fed consisting of various types of grain, either whole or baked into bread, and these symptoms were prevented when the diet was supplemented with known antiscorbutics like fresh cabbage or lemon juice. Their findings were published in 1907 in the Journal of Hygiene, but were unpopular within the scientific community as the concepts of nutritional deficiencies was unheard of at the time (the concept and word \\"vitamine\\" did not arrive until 1912, and was in part based upon Holst and Fr√∏lich's work). However, in the later work which led up to the isolation of vitamin C as the antiscorbutic factor in 1932-33, Holst and Fr√∏lich's guinea pig model of scurvy proved to be the key biological assay which allowed identification of the chemical substance (hexuronic acid, later called ascorbic acid) which was ascorbutic vitamin.

As the first Malay graduate MP, he was also highly regarded as Cikgu Sha'ari, for his role as educator. Education Sha'ari was born in Kuala Pilah, Negri Sembilan, Federated Malay States (now Malaysia). He was an ethnic Malay of Minangkabau descent and was the eldest of six siblings. He was educated at the Malay School in Kuala Pilah and completed his primary education in the sixth grade (Darjah 6) during the Japanese occupation of Malaya from 1942‚Äì1945.

Politics In the mid 1960s newly independent Singapore was facing problems such as mass unemployment, shortage of public housing as well as lack of land and natural resources. The Government's implementation of a large-scale public housing programme caused many residents from largely rural areas to be relocated to various parts of the island. There was a strong need to establish closer rapport with the people, especially in the Malay community and help them understand the need for better public housing. =First Malay graduate MP (1968)= As one of the first few Singaporean Malay scholars in the 1960s, Sha'ari was approached by the Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, to join the People's Action Party (PAP) and to contest in the republic's general elections. Dedicated to teaching and his students, it took much persuasion before Sha'ari agreed to join politics. He strongly believed in a strong foundation in education among the younger generation of citizens, and being in Parliament would enable him to continue his work and do more for the nation. =Member of Parliament for Kampong Chai Chee (1968‚Äì1976)= In February 1968 Sha'ari retired temporarily from Government Service to enable him to stand as a PAP candidate for Kampong Chai Chee in the 1968 Singapore General Elections.

This is provided for by Article 65 of the Constitution of Greece. Organization The Presidium is: *The Speaker of Parliament *Seven Deputy speakers *Three Deans *Six Secretaries It is mandatory that the fourth Deputy Speaker, one dean and one secretary belong to the major opposition party, and that the fifth Deputy Speaker and one secretary belong to the second-in-power opposition party, and that the sixth Deputy Speaker belong to the third-in- power opposition party, and that the seventh Deputy Speaker belong to the fourth-in-power opposition party. A member of the Presidium, who of course must be a parliamentarian, cannot be a member of the Cabinet or an Under- Secretary. Significance The election of the Speaker of the Parliament is one of the most important moments in the operation of the Parliament, not only because the office of the Speaker of the Parliament is significant in itself, but also because the secret vote for the election of the Speaker constitutes the first opportunity for the assessment of the cohesiveness of the majority in Parliament. The Speaker is elected by the absolute majority of the total number of the MPs (i.e. by 151 votes). If this majority is not attained, the vote is repeated, and the candidate who gets the most votes is elected. Role The Speaker of the Parliament directs the business of the Parliament, represents the Parliament, is responsible for the enforcement of disciplinary measures against parliamentarians, and generally, is the head of all the services of the Parliament and possesses all the responsibilities bestowed on him or her by the Constitution, the Standing Orders, or stemming from the principle of independence of Parliament. In other words, the Speaker has the final say on all matters that concern the inner workings of Parliament. The Speaker is third in line in the Order of Precedence of the State, following the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister and preceding the leader of the Opposition. Additionally, the Speaker stands in pro tempore for the President of the Republic when the latter is abroad for a prolonged period of time, passes away, resigns, is deposed, or is hindered from performing his or her duties for any reason whatsoever. Other Members The Deputy Speakers perform their duties as assigned to them by the Speaker or as provided in the Standing Orders. The Deans assist the Speaker in organizational and executive matters of the Parliament, while the Secretaries assist the Speaker in the Parliamentary sessions and are responsible for whatever else the Speaker assigns to them.

(ca. 1970) A synthesizer (also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. Synthesizers generate audio through methods including subtractive synthesis, additive synthesis, and frequency modulation synthesis. These sounds may be shaped and modulated by components such as filters, envelopes, and low- frequency oscillators. Synthesizers are typically played with keyboards or controlled by sequencers, software, or other instruments, often via MIDI. Synthesizer-like instruments emerged in the United States in the mid-20th century with instruments such as the RCA Mark II, which was controlled with punch cards and composed of hundreds of vacuum tubes. The Moog synthesizer, developed by Robert Moog and first sold in 1964, is credited for pioneering analog synthesis concepts such as voltage-controlled oscillators, envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers. In 1970, the cheaper, smaller Minimoog standardized synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards, compared to the modular synthesizers before it. The first mass- produced synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7, was launched in 1983, popularizing digital synthesis. Software synthesizers now can be embedded on single microchips in any electronic device. Synthesizers were initially viewed as avant-garde, valued by the 1960s psychedelic and counter-cultural scenes but with little perceived commercial potential. Switched-On Bach (1968), a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for synthesizer by Wendy Carlos, took synthesizers to the mainstream. They were adopted by electronic acts and pop and rock groups in the 1960s and 1970s, and widely used in 1980s rock. Sampling, introduced with the Fairlight synthesizer in 1979, has influenced all genres of music and had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music. Today, the synthesizer is used in nearly every genre of music, and is considered one of the most important instruments in the music industry. According to Fact in 2016, \\"The synthesizer is as important, and as ubiquitous, in modern music today as the human voice.\\"  History  = Precursors = As electricity became more widely available, the early 20th century saw the invention of electronic musical instruments including the Telharmonium, Trautonium, Ondes Martenot, and theremin. The Hammond organ, introduced in 1935, was the first electronic instrument to enjoy wide success. In 1948, the Canadian engineer Hugh Le Caine completed the electronic sackbut, a precursor to voltage-controlled synthesizers, with keyboard sensitivity allowing for vibrato, glissando, and attack control. In 1957, Harry Olson and Herbert Belar completed the RCA Mark II Sound Synthesizer at the RCA laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. The instrument read punched paper tape that controlled an analog synthesizer containing 750 vacuum tubes. It was acquired by the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and used almost exclusively by Milton Babbitt, a composer at Princeton University.Robert Moog with a Moog modular synthesizer. Many of Moog's inventions, such as voltage- controlled oscillators, became standards of synthesizers. = 1960s ‚Äì 1970s: Early years = The authors of Analog Days define \\"the early years of the synthesizer\\" as between 1964 and the mid-1970s, beginning with the debut of the Moog synthesizer. Designed by American engineer Robert Moog, the synthesizer was composed of separate modules which created and shaped sounds, connected by patch cords. Moog developed a means of controlling pitch through voltage, the voltage-controlled oscillator. This, along with Moog components such as envelopes, noise generators, filters, and sequencers, became standards in the synthesizer market. Around the same period, American engineer Don Buchla created the Buchla Modular Electronic Music System. Instead of a conventional keyboard, Buchla's system used touchplates which transmitted control voltages depending on finger position and force. However, the Moog's keyboard made it more accessible and marketable to musicians, and keyboards became the standard means of controlling synthesizers. Moog and Buchla initially avoided the word synthesizer for their instruments, as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer; however, by the 1970s, \\"synthesizer\\" had become the standard term. In 1970, Moog launched a cheaper, smaller synthesizer, the Minimoog. The Minimoog was the first synthesizer sold in music stores, and was more practical for live performance; it standardized the concept of synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards.Franklin Crawford (August 23, 2005). \\"Robert Moog, Ph.D. '64, inventor of the music synthesizer, dies of brain cancer\\". Cornell University News Service. Retrieved 4 May 2007. The Minimoog, introduced in 1970, was the first synthesizer sold in music stores. After retail stores started selling synthesizers in 1971, other synthesizer companies were established, including ARP in the US and EMS in the UK. ARP's products included the ARP 2600, which folded into a carrying case and had built-in speakers, and the Odyssey, a rival to the Minimoog. The less expensive EMS synthesizers were used by European art rock and progressive rock acts including Brian Eno and Pink Floyd. Designs for synthesizers appeared in the amateur electronics market, such as the \\"Practical Electronics Sound Synthesiser\\", published in Practical Electronics in 1973. By the mid-1970s, ARP was the world's largest synthesizer manufacturer, though it closed in 1981. Early synthesizers were monophonic, meaning they could only play one note at a time. Some of the earliest commercial polyphonic synthesizers were created by American engineer Tom Oberheim, such as the OB-X (1979). In 1978, the American company Sequential Circuits released the Prophet-5, first fully programmable polyphonic synthesizer. The Prophet-5 used microprocessors for patch memory, allowing users to store sounds. This overcame a major difficulty in previous synthesizers, which required users to adjust cables and knobs to change sounds, with no guarantee of exactly recreating a sound. This facilitated a move from synthesizers creating unpredictable sounds to producing \\"a standard package of familiar sounds\\". = 1980s: Market growth and digital technology = The synthesizer market grew dramatically in the 1980s. 1982 saw the introduction of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic instruments; it remains an industry standard. An influential sampling synthesizer, the Fairlight CMI, was released in 1979, with the ability to record and play back samples at different pitches. Though its high price made it inaccessible to amateurs, it was adopted by high-profile pop musicians including Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel. The success of the Fairlight drove competition, improving sampling technology and lowering prices; early competing samplers included the E-mu Emulator in 1981 and the Akai S-series in 1985.The Yamaha DX7, released in 1983, was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer and was widely used in 1980s pop music. In 1983, Yamaha released the first commercially successful digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7. Based on frequency modulation (FM) synthesis developed by Stanford University engineer John Chowning, the DX7 remains one of the bestselling synthesizers in history and was the first synthesizer to sell over 100,000 units. It was widely used in 1980s pop music. Compared to the \\"warm\\" and \\"fuzzy\\" sounds of analog synthesis, the DX7 was characterized by its \\"harsh\\", \\"glassy\\" and \\"chilly\\" sounds. Digital synthesizers typically contained preset sounds emulating acoustic instruments, with algorithms controlled with menus and buttons. The Synclavier, a digital synthesizer made with FM technology licensed from Yamaha, offered features such as 16-bit sampling and built-in digital recording. With a starting price of $13,000, its use was limited to universities, studios and wealthy artists. The success of the DX7 led to competing digital synthesizers. The Roland D-50 (1987) blended Roland's linear arithmetic algorithm with samples, and was the first mass-produced synthesizer with built-in effects such as delay, reverb and chorus. In 1988, the Japanese manufacturer Korg released the M1, a digital synthesizer workstation featuring sampled transients and loops; with over 250,000 units sold, it remains the bestselling synthesizer in history. The advent of digital synthesizers led to a downturn in interest in analog synthesizers. = 1990s ‚Äì present: Software synthesizers and analog revival = 1997 saw the release of ReBirth by Propellerhead Software and Reality by Seer Systems, the first software synthesizers that could be played in real time via MIDI. In 1999, an update to the music software Cubase allowed users to run software instruments (including synthesizers) as plug-ins, triggering a \\"torrent\\" of new software instruments. Propellerhead's Reason, released in 2000, offered users a virtual \\"rack\\" of recognisable studio equipment. Whereas once they had filled rooms, synthesizers now can be embedded on single microchips in any electronic device and accurately emulated by software. The market for patchable and modular synthesizers rebounded in the late 1990s. In the 2000s, older analog synthesizers regained popularity, sometimes selling for much more than their original prices. In the 2010s, new, affordable analog synthesizers were introduced by companies including Moog, Korg, Arturia, and Dave Smith Instruments. The renewed interest is credited to the appeal of imperfect \\"organic\\" sounds and simpler interfaces, and to modern surface-mount technology making analog synthesizers cheaper and faster to manufacture.  Impact  Keyboardist Keith Emerson performing with a Moog synthesizer in 1970 Early synthesizers were viewed as avant-garde, valued by the 1960s psychedelic and counter-cultural scenes for their ability to make new sounds, but with little perceived commercial potential. Switched-On Bach (1968), a bestselling album of Bach compositions arranged for Moog synthesizer by Wendy Carlos, demonstrated that synthesizers could be more than \\"random noise machines\\", taking them to the mainstream.Pinch, Trevor; Trocco, Frank (2004). Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer. Harvard University Press. . However, debates were held about the appropriateness of synthesizers in baroque music, and according to the Guardian they were quickly abandoned in \\"serious classical circles\\". The Moog was adopted by acts including the Doors, the Grateful Dead, the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Keith Emerson. Emerson was the first major rock musician to perform with the Moog and it became a trademark of his performances, helping take his band Emerson, Lake & Palmer to global stardom; according to Analog Days, the likes of Emerson, with his Moog performances, \\"did for the keyboard what Jimi Hendrix did for the guitar\\". The portable Minimoog (1970), much smaller than the modular synthesizers before it, made synthesizers more common in live performance. The Minimoog took a place in mainstream black music, most notably in the work of Stevie Wonder, and in jazz, such as the work of Sun Ra. It was also used by electronic artists such as Kraftwerk, who used it on their albums Autobahn (1974) and The Man-Machine (1978), and later by Tangerine Dream, Klaus Schulze, and Gary Numan. In the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the Micromoog was widely used in the emerging disco genre by artists including Abba and Giorgio Moroder. Some acts felt that using synthesizers to create sounds was \\"cheating\\"; Queen wrote in their album liner notes that they did not use them. Early synthesizers could only play one note at a time, making them suitable for basslines, leads and solos. With the rise of polyphonic synthesizers in the 70s and 80s, \\"the keyboard in rock once more started to revert to the background, to be used for fills and atmosphere rather than for soloing\\". Sampling, introduced with the Fairlight synthesizer in 1979, has influenced all genres of music and had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music. In the 1970s, electronic music composers such as Jean Michel Jarre and Isao Tomita released successful synthesizer-led instrumental albums. This influenced the emergence of synthpop, a subgenre of new wave, from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. The work of German krautrock bands such as Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream, British acts such as John Foxx, Gary Numan and David Bowie, African-American acts such as George Clinton and Zapp, and Japanese electronic acts such as Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kitaro were influential in the development of the genre. Gary Numan's 1979 hits \\"Are 'Friends' Electric?\\" and \\"Cars\\" made heavy use of synthesizers. OMD's \\"Enola Gay\\" (1980) used distinctive electronic percussion and a synthesized melody. Soft Cell used a synthesized melody on their 1981 hit \\"Tainted Love\\". Nick Rhodes, keyboardist of Duran Duran, used various synthesizers including the Roland Jupiter-4 and Jupiter-8. Chart hits include Depeche Mode's \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" (1981), the Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\" and works by Ultravox. In the 1980s, digital synthesizers were widely used in pop music. The Yamaha DX7, released in 1983, became a pop staple, used on songs by A-ha, Kenny Loggins, Kool & the Gang. Its \\"E PIANO 1\\" preset became particularly famous, especially for power ballads, and was used by artists including Whitney Houston, Chicago, Prince, Phil Collins, Luther Vandross, Billy Ocean, and Celine Dion. The Roland TB-303 (1981), in conjunction with the Roland TR-808 and TR-909 drum machines, became a foundation of electronic dance music genres such as house and techno when producers acquired cheap second-hand units later in the decade. Korg M1 presets were widely used in 1990s house music, beginning with Madonna's 1990 single \\"Vogue\\". Today, the synthesizer is used in nearly every genre of music. It is considered by the authors of Analog Days \\"the only innovation that can stand alongside the electric guitar as a great new instrument of the age of electricity ... Both led to new forms of music, and both had massive popular appeal.\\" The authors draw a connection to the synthesizer's origins in 1960s psychedelia to the raves and British \\"second summer of love\\" of the 1980s and the club scenes of the 1990s and 2000s. According to Fact in 2016, \\"The synthesizer is as important, and as ubiquitous, in modern music today as the human voice.\\" It is one of the most important instruments in the music industry. = Film and television = Synthesizers are common in film and television soundtracks. ARP synthesizers, for example, were used to create sound effects for the 1977 science fiction films Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars, including the \\"voice\\" of the robot R2-D2. In the 70s and 80s, synthesizers were used in the scores for thrillers and horror films including A Clockwork Orange (1971), Apocalypse Now (1979), The Fog (1980) and Manhunter (1986). They were also used to create themes for television shows including Knight Rider (1982), Twin Peaks (1990) and Stranger Things (2016). = Jobs = The rise of the synthesizer led to major changes in music industry jobs, comparable to the earlier arrival of sound in film, which put live musicians accompanying silent films out of work.From Stage to Studio: Musicians and the Sound Revolution, 1890‚Äì1950 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996). With its ability to imitate instruments such as strings and horns, the synthesizer threatened the jobs of session musicians. For a period, the Moog was banned from use in commercial work, a restriction negotiated by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Robert Moog felt that the AFM had not realized that his instrument had to be studied like any other, and instead imagined that \\"all the sounds that musicians could make somehow existed in the Moog ‚Äî all you had to do was push a button that said 'Jascha Heifetz' and out would come the most fantastic violin player\\".Interview with Bob Moog, Plug, Fall 1974,p.2. Musician Walter Sear persuaded the AFM that the synthesizer demanded skill, and the category of \\"synthesizer player\\" was accepted into the union; however, players were still subject to \\"suspicion and hostility\\" for several years. In 1982, following a tour by Barry Manilow using synthesizers instead of an orchestra, the British Musicians' Union attempted to ban synthesizers, attracting controversy. That decade, a few musicians skilled at programming the popular Yamaha DX7 found employment creating sounds for other acts.  Sound synthesis  Additive synthesis builds sounds by combining several waveforms, usually sine waves, into a composite sound. Additive synthesis was used as early as on Teleharmonium in 1900s and Hammond organ in 1930s.virtual analog synth. Subtractive synthesis uses oscillators to generate waveforms, then shapes them with filters to remove or boost specific frequencies. FM synthesis was hugely successful in the earliest digital synthesizers. Frequency modulation (FM) synthesis creates sounds by modulating one waveform with the frequency of another; the resulting complex waveform can, in turn, be used to modulate another, and this another, and so on. FM synthesis can imitate acoustic sounds such as piano, strings and organs. Phase distortion synthesis is a method implemented on Casio CZ synthesizers. It replaces the traditional analog waveform with a choice of several digital waveforms which are more complex than the standard square, sine, and sawtooth waves. This waveform is routed to a digital filter and digital amplifier, each modulated by an eight-stage envelope. The sound can then be further modified with ring modulation or noise modulation. Physical modelling synthesis is often implemented as software synthesizers. Physical modelling synthesis is the synthesis of sound by using a set of equations and algorithms to simulate each sonic characteristic of an instrument, starting with the harmonics that make up the tone itself, then adding the sound of the resonator, the instrument body, etc., until the sound realistically approximates the desired instrument. When an initial set of parameters is run through the physical simulation, the simulated sound is generated. Although physical modeling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, it was not until the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible. The quality and speed of physical modeling on computers improves with higher processing power. Analysis/resynthesis is typically used on the vocoder. Linear arithmetic synthesis is a form of synthesis developed by Roland that utilizes PCM samples for the attack of a waveform, and subtractive synthesis for the rest of the envelope. This type of synthesis bridges the gap between the older subtractive synthesis and the newer sample-based synthesis at a time where PCM samples would take up a substantial amount of the memory allotted. The first synthesizer to debut with this form of synthesis was the Roland D-50 in 1987. Sample-based synthesis involves digitally recording a short snippet of sound from a real instrument or other source and then playing it back at different speeds to produce different pitches. A sample can be played as a one shot, used often for percussion or short duration sounds, or it can be looped, which allows the tone to sustain or repeat as long as the note is held. Samplers usually include a filter, envelope generators, and other controls for further manipulation of the sound. Virtual samplers that store the samples on a hard drive make it possible for the sounds of an entire orchestra, including multiple articulations of each instrument, to be accessed from a sample library. See also Wavetable synthesis, Vector synthesis. is a form of synthesis that uses a series of bandpass filters or Fourier transforms to analyze the harmonic content of a sound. The results are then used to resynthesize the sound using a band of oscillators. The vocoder, linear predictive coding, and some forms of speech synthesis are based on analysis/resynthesis.  Components  Synthesizers generate sound through various analogue and digital techniques. Early synthesizers were analog hardware based but many modern synthesizers use a combination of DSP software and hardware or else are purely software-based (see softsynth). Digital synthesizers often emulate classic analog designs. Sound is controllable by the operator by means of circuits or virtual stages that may include: *Oscillators typically produce waveforms (such as sawtooth, sine, or pulse waves) with different timbres. *Low-frequency oscillators (LFOs) produce waveforms used to modulate parameters, such as the pitch of oscillators (producing vibrato). *Voltage-controlled filter (VCFs) ‚Äì \\"shape\\" the sound generated by the oscillators in the frequency domain, often under the control of an envelope or LFO. These are essential to subtractive synthesis. *Envelope generators ‚Äì provide envelope modulation to \\"shape\\" the volume or harmonic content of the produced note in the time domain with the principal parameters being attack, decay, sustain and release. These are used in most forms of synthesis. ADSR control is provided by envelope generators. *Voltage- controlled amplifiers (VCAs) control the volume or gain of the audio signal. VCAs can be modulated by other components, such as LFOs and envelopes. *After the signal generated by one (or a mix of more) VCOs has been modified by filters and LFOs, and its waveform has been shaped (contoured) by an ADSR envelope generator, it then passes on to one or more voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator. The gain of the VCA is affected by a control voltage (CV), coming from an envelope generator, an LFO, the keyboard or some other source. = Filter = Filters are particularly important in subtractive synthesis, being designed to pass some frequency regions (or \\"bands\\") through unattenuated while significantly attenuating (\\"subtracting\\") others. The low-pass filter is most frequently used, but band-pass filters, band-reject filters and high-pass filters are also sometimes available. The filter may be controlled with a second ADSR envelope. An \\"envelope modulation\\" (\\"env mod\\") parameter on many synthesizers with filter envelopes determines how much the envelope affects the filter. If turned all the way down, the filter produces a flat sound with no envelope. When turned up the envelope becomes more noticeable, expanding the minimum and maximum range of the filter. The envelope applied on the filter helps the sound designer generating long notes or short notes by moving the parameters up and down such as decay, sustain and finally release. For instance by using a short decay with no sustain, the sound generated is commonly known as a stab. Sound designers may prefer shaping the sound with filter instead of volume. = Envelope = Schematic of ADSR Envelopes control how sounds change over time. They may control parameters such as amplitude (volume), filters (frequencies), or pitch. The most common envelope is the ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelope: *Attack time is the time taken for initial run-up of level from nil to peak, beginning when the note is triggered. *Decay time is the time taken for the subsequent run down from the attack level to the designated sustain level. *Sustain level is the level during the main sequence of the sound's duration, until the key is released. *Release time is the time taken for the level to decay from the sustain level to zero after the key is released. = LFO = A low-frequency oscillator (LFO) generates an electronic signal, usually below 20 Hz. LFO signals create a periodic control signal or sweep, often used in vibrato, tremolo and other effects. In certain genres of electronic music, the LFO signal can control the cutoff frequency of a VCF to make a rhythmic wah-wah sound, or the signature dubstep wobble bass. = Arpeggiator = An arpeggiator (arp) is a feature available on several synthesizers that automatically steps through a sequence of notes based on an input chord, thus creating an arpeggio. The notes can often be transmitted to a MIDI sequencer for recording and further editing. An arpeggiator may have controls for speed, range, and order in which the notes play; upwards, downwards, or in a random order. More advanced arpeggiators allow the user to step through a pre-programmed complex sequence of notes, or play several arpeggios at once. Some allow a pattern sustained after releasing keys: in this way, a sequence of arpeggio patterns may be built up over time by pressing several keys one after the other. Arpeggiators are also commonly found in software sequencers. Some arpeggiators/sequencers expand features into a full phrase sequencer, which allows the user to trigger complex, multi- track blocks of sequenced data from a keyboard or input device, typically synchronized with the tempo of the master clock. Arpeggiators seem to have grown from the accompaniment system used in electronic organs in the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. = Controllers = Synthesizers are often controlled with electronic or digital keyboards or MIDI controller keyboards, which may be built into the synthesizer unit or attached via connections such as CV/gate, USB, or MIDI. Keyboards may offer expression such as velocity sensitivity and aftertouch, allowing for more control over the sound. Other controllers include Ribbon controllers, which track the movement of the finger across a touch-sensitive surface; wind controllers, played similarly to woodwind instruments; motion-sensitive controllers similar to video game motion controllers; electronic drum pads, played similarly to the heads of a drum kit; touchplates, which send signals depending on finger position and force; controllers designed for microtonal tunings; touchscreen devices such as tablets and smartphones; and fingerpads. Clones Moog Minimoog Synthesizer clones are unlicensed recreations of previous synthesizers, often marketed as affordable versions of famous musical equipment. Clones are available as physical instruments and software. Companies that have sold software clones include Arturia and Native Instruments. Behringer manufactures equipment modelled on instruments including the Minimoog, Pro-One, TB-303, and drum machines such as the TR-808. Other synthesizer clones include the MiniMOD (a series of Eurorack modules based on the Minimoog), the Intellijel Atlantis (based on the SH-101), and the x0x Heart (based on the TB-303). Creating clones of older hardware is legal where the patents have expired. In 1997, Mackie lost their lawsuit against Behringer as copyright law in the United States did not cover their circuit board designs. In 2006, Roland and Behringer reached a settlement after Roland claimed Behringer's effects units were too similar to its Boss pedals.

The film stars Kalyan Kumar, Rajinikanth, B. Saroja Devi and Aarathi in the lead roles. The supporting cast includes Lokanath, Vamana Rao, Shivaramaiah and Master Umesh. The film won three awards at the 1975‚Äì76 Karnataka State Film Awards, including the award for Best Actress (Aarathi). The 1984 Tamil film Kai Kodukkum Kai was an extended version of the Munithayi segment from this movie. Rajnikanth, who played the antagonist role in the Kannada movie, played the lead role in the Tamil version. The antagonist role of the Kannada movie was also an inspiration for Rajanikanth's characterization in the 1977 Tamil movie 16 Vayathinile directed by debutant Bharathiraja who was an associate of Puttanna Kanagal. Cast *B. Saroja Devi *Aarathi *Rajinikanth *Kalyan Kumar *Leelavathi Hangu The movie is based on a short story by the Kannada writer Giraddi Govindaraj. It is about a poor university professor with high moral values and integrity who is offered a bribe from a wealthy contractor to push some grace marks to his son in his exam paper so that he could get enough percentage to qualify for a medical college. This happens just when the professor's young son is critically ill and requires expensive medical treatment. Whether the professor succumbs to the circumstances or he let go of his integrity forms the crux of the story. Atithi It tells the story of a middle-aged woman who is the warden of a girls hostel. When younger she had refused to marry the man who loved her because of her ideals about feminism. She had even decided to say unmarried her entire life. A chance encounter with the man, now happily married to someone else, makes her question her earlier decision of not accepting true love. Munithaayi It has a story of wealthy man marrying a blind girl (Aarathi) out of pity, but in his absence she is raped by an adolescent youth and later blackmailed. The husband eventually \\"forgives\\" her. Aarathi plays the role of the blind girl and Rajinikanth plays a small role as the man who rapes her.

It is a remake of the 1976 Tamil film Mayangukiral Oru Maadhu. The film stars Aarathi, Gangadhar, Ramgopal, Rajinikanth, Udaya Chandrika and Pandari Bai. In Baalu Jenu, a married woman must try to keep a one-night stand that she had in college a secret from her husband, and thwart a persistent blackmailer intent on collecting money from her to keep quite about it. It was released on 10 December 1976, and became a commercial success.  Plot  Geetha, an oestrogen-charged college student in Mysore, has a one-night stand with Chandru, whose advances she succumbed to. Chandru is arrested on suspicion of abetting his father in smuggling and is sentenced to five years in prison. Geetha futilely tries to find Chandru and then consumes poison, fearing she might be pregnant. Her hostel roommate Revathi and a doctor save her on time. After Geetha graduates, her marriage is arranged; to her surprise, the prospective groom's elder sister is the same doctor who saved her life and knows her secret. The doctor wholeheartedly recommends Geetha for her brother Ravi, a wealthy businessman. Ravi and Geetha get married and have a child. Some years later, Geetha runs into Revathi at a sari shop. Revathi is married to Vasu, a photographer, and they too have a child. Vasu is the photographer who earlier blackmailed Chandru's father as he has pictures of him in flagrante delicto. Revathi and Vasu visit Ravi and Geetha for a meal. Vasu takes photographs of the family. While developing the pictures, Vasu recalls Geetha's features; he had earlier clicked Geetha and Chandru during their amorous tryst and had been blackmailing Chandru before the latter got arrested. Chandru is released from prison, and to Geetha's horror, Ravi hires him to be their driver. Vasu begins blackmailing Geetha and his financial demands increase. He also has altercations with Chandru. Geetha cannot cope with the mental and financial strain; she has a breakdown and is hospitalised. Chandru raids Vasu's darkroom, hoping to retrieve the damning negatives. In the ensuing fracas, Revathi bursts in and threatens to immolate herself and her child. Faced with the threat of losing his family before his very eyes, Vasu destroys the incriminating negatives and redeems himself. At the hospital, Ravi tells Geetha that he had full knowledge of the Chandru affair all along.  Cast  * Aarathi as Geetha * Gangadhar as Ravi * Ramgopal as Chandru * Rajinikanth as Vasu * Udaya Chandrika as Revathi * Pandari Bai as the doctor  Production  Baalu Jenu is a remake of the 1976 Tamil film Mayangukiral Oru Maadhu. It was directed by Balan and Kunigal Nagabhushan, and produced by K. R. Ravichandran under S G S Films. Co-director Nagabhushan also wrote the screenplay. Cinematography was handled by T. M. Sundara Babu, and editing by P. K. Krishnan. Rajinikanth, after watching Thengai Srinivasan's performance in the original film as a blackmailing photographer, expressed his desire to reprise that role and duly got it. Baalu Jenu was also the first film where a character played by Rajinikanth had a major onscreen fight sequence.  Themes  Film critic Naman Ramachandran noted numerous parallels between Rajinikanth's character Vasu in Baalu Jenu and his character Prasad in Moondru Mudichu (1976). He also compared it to many other earlier Rajinikanth films such as Apoorva Raagangal (1975), Munithaayi (a segment of the 1976 anthology film Katha Sangama), Anthuleni Katha (1976) and Moondru Mudichu due to the fact that they focused on a central female character.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was composed by G. K. Venkatesh, with lyrics by Kunigal Nagabhushanam and R. N. Jayagopal.  Release  Baalu Jenu was released on 10 December 1976. The film became a commercial success, and Rajinikanth went on to play more negative roles in films.

Muthuraman and written by Panchu Arunachalam. It is based on the novel of the same name by Maharishi. The film stars Sivakumar, Rajinikanth and Sumithra. It focuses on two friends with conflicting characters and their conflicting lives. Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri was notable for casting Rajinikanth and Sivakumar as a hero and antihero respectively, contrary to the roles they played in earlier films. It was released on 9 September 1977. The film shocked audiences who were used to seeing Rajinikanth and Sivakumar in their usual roles; nevertheless, it was a commercial success, and won two Filmfare Awards: Best Tamil Film and Best Tamil Director for Muthuraman. The success of Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri led to Rajinikanth playing more positive roles in films.  Plot  Nagaraj and Sampath are garment salesmen and roommates in Tirunelveli. While Sampath is a straightforward person who believes in honesty, Nagaraj is a womaniser, in contrast to Sampath who believes in true love. Sampath's lover Raji, while fleeing from a rogue bull, dies due to an accident. A depressed Sampath attempts suicide, but Nagaraj stops him, and Sampath decides to stop selling garments, instead confining himself to remaining Nagaraj's assistant. Aboard a train bound for Madras, Nagaraj and Sampath encounter Muthu, a temple trust clerk who has a suitcase full of cash. But Muthu dies en route of a heart attack and Nagaraj steals his suitcase, over Sampath's objections. Muthu's sister Bhuvana visits them at Nagercoil to enquire about the lost cash (which is all black money). Nagaraj denies knowing anything, but Bhuvana remains suspicious. He pretends to love her; Bhuvana falls for his lust and has sex with him. Nagaraj uses some of the black money to open his own garment store. To make the rest of the money legitimate, he decides to marry Manohari, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Bhuvana, pregnant by Nagaraj, refuses to abort the baby and wants Nagaraj to marry her, but he refuses. To save Bhuvana's honour and help his friend, Sampath marries Bhuvana but they only share a platonic relationship, while Nagaraj marries Manohari and his business flourishes. Sampath wants to have a physical relationship with Bhuvana but she rejects him, saying he is like a god to her. Sampath raises Bhuvana's son as his own. Meanwhile, Nagarajan and Manohari yearn for a child as the former has now become impotent due to his excessive libido. Nagaraj demands that his son be given to him for adoption but Bhuvana refuses. When the child becomes ill and needs an injection, Nagaraj enters into a bargain that he would give the medicine from his pharmacy, provided it is agreed that the child is given to him in adoption. But Sampath arrives on time to deliver the injection and the child is saved. A short while later, Sampath succumbs to cardiac arrest, the result of years of excessive smoking and drinking. Bhuvana prefers to live as his widow.  Cast  * Sivakumar as Nagaraj * Rajinikanth as Sampath * Sumithra as Bhuvana * Jaya as Manohari * Meera as Raaji * Suruli Rajan as Manohari's father *Y. G. Mahendran as Muthu  Production  Writer Panchu Arunachalam and director S. P. Muthuraman initially wanted Rajinikanth to play a small role in a low-budget film. But after meeting him, the duo found him to have \\"brightness\\" and decided to cast him in \\"something bigger, better\\". The film was Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Maharishi. Produced by N. S. Mani under the banner M. A. M. Films, its screenplay was written by Arunachalam. The film was the first collaboration of Rajinikanth and Muthuraman. This film had a role swap as Sivakumar, then known for playing clean and positive characters, played an antihero while Rajinikanth, then an established villain, played a positive character. Muthuraman said he deliberately cast Rajinikanth against type since he wanted to \\"experiment with his acting skills\\". He also explained that his decision to shoot the film in black-and-white, rather than colour, was budget-related because \\"colour film had to be imported and was very expensive\\". Since Rajinikanth was not fluent in Tamil at that time, he was trained by S. L. Narayanan, who was popularly known by the prefix \\"Vaadhyar\\". Cinematography was handled by Babu. The film was edited by R. Vittal, and its final length measured .  Soundtrack  Ilaiyaraaja composed the music for the film. The song \\"Vizhiyile\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Natabhairavi, and \\"Poo Thendrale\\" is set in Rageshree. In June 2013, A. Muthusamy of Honey Bee Music released a 5.1 surround sound version of the soundtrack.  Release and reception  Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri was released on 9 September 1977. The film shocked audiences who were used to seeing Rajinikanth in negative roles, and Sivakumar in heroic roles. Nevertheless, it won the Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film and Muthuraman won the Best Tamil Director award at the same ceremony. Rajinikanth's performance won him the Thirai Kathir Award for Best Supporting Actor. In 1978, the critic from Film World stated that although Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri dealt with social questions, it \\"neither had the motivation nor the justification very much essential to make a film realistic; at best [it] appeared frivolous.\\"  Legacy  The success of Bhuvana Oru Kelvi Kuri paved way for Rajinikanth the opportunity to do more hero oriented films. Although Sivakumar's fans disliked seeing him play a negative character, he received numerous offers to play negative roles following this film's success, and felt accepting to play Nagaraj was a mistake; he elaborated, \\"I do not wish to be typed either as a goody- goody leading man or a villain. I would like to act all types of roles.\\" Film producer and writer G. Dhananjayan wrote that it is one of five films Rajinikanth considers \\"close to his heart\\"; the other four are Mullum Malarum (1978), Aarilirunthu Arubathu Varai (1979) and Enkeyo Ketta Kural (1982) and Sri Raghavendrar (1985).

Plot  Mookaiyah (Rajinikanth) and his sister Bairavi (Geetha) are the children of a drunkard (T. K. Ramachandran). They are separated after Bhairavi gets lost in an accident. Following this, Mookaiyah becomes a servant of a local landlord (Sreekanth). Mookaiyah is a loyal servant and does whatever is asked of him.

The night between June 16 and 17, 2000, he killed and then dismembered his cohabitant Marianne Pedersen and her two sons, Dennis (10) and Brian (12), in their house at N√∏rreg√•rdsvej 26 in R√∏dovre. On October 10, 2000, he was found guilty of having caused Marianne Pedersen and her two sons' deaths, but claimed that it was an accident. His defendant, lawyer Bj√∏rn Lund Hansen, also argued in court that it was an accident, and when Lundin was found guilty, he asked for a timed sentence of 16 years in prison. State Attorney Erik Merlung, who represented the case as a prosecutor, had always thought that Lundin should be sentenced for murder, and he demanded life imprisonment. Despite the Retsl√¶ger√•det's recommendation - and eventual success - in granting the prosecutor's request for life imprisonment, the country's highest judicial and medical experts had recommended the prisoner remain in custody. The case is one of Denmark's most horrifying and most talked about murders in recent times. Lundin is currently serving his life sentence at the Institution of Herstedvester. Early life and upbringing Peter Lundin was born on February 15, 1972 at Roskilde Sygehus, as the son of Ole Bostr√∏m Lundin (1935‚Äî2014) and the German-born Anna Lundin (n√©e Schaftner; 1932‚Äî1991). In 1950, Ole Lundin and his brother had moved from Canada to the United States, with the purpose of joining the United States Army, where they could keep their Danish citizenship, unlike in the Canadian army. The brother was sent to Korea, where he died from a virus, while Ole was stationed in West Germany. While serving in West Germany, Ole met the young German girl Anna Schaftner. They got married and later settled in Denmark. Ole got a job as a bricklayer and built the couple's house on Fuglesangsvej in Solr√∏d Strand.Palle Bruus Jensen (2003). The case Lundin . Documentas publisher In 1979, the master builder Lundin got a blood clot that incapacitated him, and coupled with the family's financial struggles, their house was given a foreclosure. Following this, they decided to emigrate to the United States with their 9-year-old son Peter.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 37 They bought a house on Essex Drive in the town of Ormond Beach, Florida, where they ran a motel. In 1984, the family moved into a newly acquired house in Maggie Valley, North Carolina. A few years later, Ole decided to leave his wife Anna, taking his son with him. Together, they initially settled in Los Angeles, where they stayed for a few weeks. They then moved on to New York City, but as it was unsuccessful, they tried staying in Boston. Their journey ended in Miami, where Ole found an apartment and got working as a bricklayer again. However, the couple Lundin got together again, with the father and son bringing Anna down to Florida from North Carolina. In the meantime, the 14-year-old Peter had started studying at a school in Miami.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 39 During his school time in Miami, Peter worked various jobs in his spare time, including as a waiter at a restaurant. On the day he turned 16, he left school and instead began work as a bricklayer with his father. It was during this period that he first became acquainted with drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. However, the family moved back to Maggie Valley again, where he started learning at the local high school. At this time, Peter started selling cannabis to his classmates.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 40 First conviction =Murder of his mother= The murder of Anna Schaftner Lundin took place around April 1, 1991 (the exact date has never been established with certainty). Peter Lundin was 19 years old, and there had been chaos in the family for a long time. Both of them often being drunk, Peter and Ole were violent towards Anna. The situation had previously been so serious that the family's neighbors had called the police several times, but no report came out of the police's visit.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 42 It is suspected that a quarrel caused the murder. Anna Lundin wanted to cut off her son Peter's long hair, causing him to choke her. Together with his father, they drove the body to the city of Buxton and buried her on the wide sandy beach of Cape Hatteras. On November 1, 1991, some passers-by who were on a walk on the beach near the lighthouse at the Outer Banks in Buxton discovered the body of a woman which had been washed ashore. The body was wrapped in a blue blanket, covered with black plastic and wrapped with tape and a yellow rope.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 44 Peter and his father had since fled to Canada, but on June 6, 1992, they were both arrested at a Toronto hotel room. In July 1993, Peter Lundin was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in Dare County. At the same time, his father Ole was sentenced to 2 years as an accomplice. Both were ordered to be deported to Denmark on completing their sentences. Ole finished his sentence and was deported, while Peter appealed both the length of the sentence and to the expulsion. He failed to overturn his conviction, but on February 16, 1995 his sentence was reduced to 15 years, which he served at Brown Creek Correctional Institution.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 48/49 =The American Dream= In 1994, Lundin was interviewed by Danish TV channel \\"TV 2\\" during his stay in prison. The broadcast by Nordisk Film TV for TV 2, and it was organized by the television journalist Jesper Klit. The broadcast was called The American Dream and was about how young Danes had gone across the Atlantic. It was also in just one case that Lundin took part in the program. The Danish TV folks randomly browsed in a newspaper and it was there that they came across the story that a Danish citizen named Peter Lundin had been convicted of murdering his mother. Organizer Jesper Klit then wrote a letter to Lundin and asked if he would participate in an interview for Danish television. Lundin replied that he would like that, and the formalities with regard to the TV recordings were then arranged with the American prison authorities, who had a very liberal attitude towards interviewing inmates.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 33 During the broadcast, he colored one part of his face black and the other white, to symbolize \\"good and evil\\". After viewing this interview, a renowned Swedish psychiatrist, Professor Sten Levander, awarded Lundin 39 points (of a possible 40) on the Psychopathy Checklist.Den v√¶rste psykopat jeg har setLundin stemplet som psykopat The documentary was broadcast on TV 2 on December 14, 1994. =Release and deportation= Lundin was released after barely serving half of his sentence. The state of North Carolina at the time had a desperate lack of prison capacity. The serious lack of space was due, among other things, to a very large number of prisoners from the US Army, who were convicted of wife abuse and murder. Most of these convicts came from the huge military base of Fort Bragg. The authorities therefore had chosen to halve the penalties for anyone who was imprisoned after a certain date and the law at the time did not allow convicts to serve in another US state.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 50 On June 4, 1999, he arrived at Copenhagen Airport, where he had been escorted by four US police officers. After arriving in Denmark, Peter moved with his wife Tina Lundin (whom he had married in 1996 during his prison service) and her teenage daughter in M√•l√∏v. Second conviction =Triple murder= In the fall of 1999, during a violent attack on his wife and her daughter, which resulted in him being thrown out of the apartment, Peter moved into the Men's Home in N√∏rrebro. While living there, he visited a brothel on Fasanvej 239 in Copenhagen, where he subsequently met Marianne Pedersen, an employee of the brothel. Marianne Pedersen (1963-2000) was 36 years old, an early retiree and had been a widow for a year. Her late husband was a former painter, and even before his death, they started a massage clinic (a small brothel) at Fasanvej, where she earned money as a sex worker. Pedersen and her two sons, Dennis and Brian, lived in the Copenhagen suburb of R√∏dovre. Lundin and Marianne subsequently became lovers. On July 3, 2000, Pedersen and her sons were declared missing by her older step-son. He contacted police because he was worried that he could not reach Pedersen or the boys on their cellphones. He had found a note on her front door that said they had gone on a vacation. The note was unusually worded, and thus alarmed, the stepson went into the house to look for the family. He found the home in disarray with the furniture moved away from the walls, trash lying around, vomit in both toilets, and a strange smell in the basement. After filing a missing person‚Äôs report, police began investigating the disappearance. Upon an initial search of the house, it appeared there were discrete blood stains scattered around the house. Further investigation revealed blood stains in Pedersen‚Äôs bed, her car and in the cellar, traces of blood between bathroom tiles and even on a chopping board and a blender in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Police went to Lundins home address and searched the premises. Lundin claimed that they were on holiday and he had agreed to paint their house. But on July 5, 2000, Lundin was arrested and detained for four weeks, charged with murder. Further studies of the house led to the conclusion that Pedersen and her two sons had been killed and dismembered. The first dismemberment had taken place in the basement, while the other two in the garage. A recently cleaned freezer located in a shed at the Pedersen property also had traces of blood inside. Deputy Chief Inspector Niels Kj√∏ller from Hvidovre Criminal Police told the press: \\"Both places looked like slaughterhouses, even though Peter had tried to erase his tracks by cleaning up.\\" From remnants of human tissue, the police technicians were able to observe that Lundin had used an angle grinder in the garage and there were about 100 visible cutting marks on the floor, revealing that he had used an axe. Lundin changed his explanation after three weeks. He explained that he heard screams from the basement at night between June 16 and 17, 2000, and there he found the two boys lying on the floor - killed with a knife by Marianne. She was supposedly unconscious after taking drugs. He then began to beat her because she had killed the boys, and according to his explanation, he struck her \\"not seriously\\" and she died shortly after. He did not call the police as he thought they would not believe his story because of his past, and instead decided to dismember the bodies. On October 10, 2000, he confessed to killing them. He explained that Marianne and him had a quarrel because she \\"had spoken sweetly\\" on the phone with another man. Subsequently, they all got up to fight on her double bed in the bedroom, and there he broke all three's necks with his bare hands. After the murders, he placed the bodies in the house's freezers. This story was not quite corroborated by the forensic evidence, however, as it was reasonably determined that one of the boys had died in the basement, and investigators found it unlikely that he had broken their necks the way he claimed. On June 19, 2000, Lundin went shopping at a Metro in Glostrup, where he bought an axe, rubber glove, plastic bags and cleaning agents, after which he dismembered the bodies. Lundin put the body parts in plastic bags, which he placed for bulky waste outside the house, which was thus driven for incineration. He then probably drove further around Zealand in Marianne's Ford Mondeo and placed smaller body parts in various waste containers. About 10,000 tonnes of slag were investigated at Vestforbr√¶nding, as well as a waste site in Holme-Ostrup near N√¶stved, and with the help of the Danish Emergency Management Agency, the entire Vestvolden was searched. The bodies of Pedersen and her two sons have never been recovered. The trial The trial of Peter Lundin was scheduled at the √òstre Landsret on March 5, 2001. Just a few days before, the police and state prosecutor Erik Merlung hoped that Lundin would admit his guilt to deliberate manslaughter. However, it did not happen this time, and the case therefore had to be decided by judges and jurors. The chairman started by addressing directly to the twelve jurors with the following remark: \\"In recent years, few cases have attracted so much attention as this jury case we will be dealing with today, of the line that applies to publicity of criminal cases.\\"Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 102/103 In addition, the President pointed out the concern about the influence that both judges and jurors had inevitably been exposed through the media's mentions of the case over the nearly eight months since the arrest. Directly addressing to the jurors, he said: \\"By your subsequent decision in the case, they must not take into account anything that you have NOT been informed here in the courtroom, TV, etc. They also have to look away from what you had to hear or see outside the courtroom during the course of the trial.\\"Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 103 =Judgments= Peter Lundin insisted that he did not mean to kill his victims, but the jurors did not believe him. They sentenced him as guilty of intentional murder and manslaughter. As a detail, he was also convicted of theft, from the house at Norregardsvej. Prosecutor Attorney General Erik Merlung said soberly and calmly in his criminal record procedure: \\"The circumstances, nature and extent of the crimes committed by the defendant are in a state of horror and fright. One can only respond to these as a society and take the right security measures by imposing a lifetime sentence.\\" Lundin's lawyer Bj√∏rn Lund Hansen made a vigorous effort to get the jurors to sentence his client a timed penalty of approximately sixteen years. Lund Hansen called his client's actions \\"obnoxious\\" and \\"creepy\\", but nevertheless appealed to jurors and judges to settle for giving Lundin 16 years imprisonment for the murders. He compared Lundin's three murders to the case of the doctor Elisabeth W√¶ver, who was sentenced to life for a murderous arson attack against his lover's wife and two children: \\"Killing by fire is an aggravation. It is an expression of a carefully planned crime, while my client's actions are spontaneous and impulsive.\\", said Bj√∏rn Lund Hansen without much conviction. Before the jurors retired to testify to the length of the punishment, Lundin had the opportunity to say the last words to the jurors and he took advantage of it: \\"We must all have peace now. We must have peace in our mind and in our soul.\\" The judges and jurors eventually chose to listen to the prosecutor. On March 15, 2001, after ten days of court hearings, the three country judges Niels Johan Petersen, Ejler Bruun and Hans Christian Thomsen delivered the verdict on Peter Lundin - life imprisonment. The sentence of lifetime was unanimous and came after only 10 minutes of voting. All 24 votes were given for life imprisonment. (In a jury trial, the 12 jurors each have one vote and the three professional judges every four votes when the punishment is met.) Lundin asked for some time to think, and even though he had the opportunity to appeal the sentence to the Supreme Court, he did not. The father, Ole Lundin, was not convicted of complicity or involvement in the disposal of the three bodies. However, he was convicted of theft of several of Marianne Pedersen's personal belongings, which the police found during a search on his residence at Strandvejen 201 in Hellerup. Judge Jes Schioler believed that even though Ole Lundin, due to his age and other personal circumstances, would normally only be in a conditional punishment or community service, the circumstances of the theft were so serious that it had to be reflected in the punishment. He was sentenced to 4 months of unconditional imprisonment on June 7, 2002. =Death penalty= In the spring of 2001, \\"The National Association of the Execution of Peter Lundin\\" was founded by the former convicted smuggler and heavyweight boxer Mark Hulstr√∏m, and other anonymous people. The association did not demand reinstatement of the death penalty in the criminal code, but that the Folketing adopt a special law that would give the death penalty exclusively to Peter Lundin. Lundin apparently believed that there was death penalty in Denmark at the time, explaining this on a cassette tape in the prison, which Ekstra Bladet came into possession of in 2008. Due to this belief, he also thought he could not be convicted of murder if he disposed of the bodies. Political controversy Danish police have subsequently been blamed for not keeping a watchful eye on Peter Lundin after he was handed over to Denmark.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 50 The US Department of Interpol had routinely informed the Copenhagen Police that the four escorting officers from North Carolina were on their way with a murderous man who had been expelled to Denmark after he had passed his punishment in the US. The Danish police responded routinely - but since they had nothing outstanding against Lundin in Denmark, they considered him a normal Danish citizen.Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 51 In any case, no special attention was paid to him after his arrival at the Copenhagen Airport on June 4, 1999. The fact that Danish police had not monitored Peter Lundin from the moment he set foot in Denmark, led MP Eva Kjer Hansen (Venstre) to ask questions to then Minister of Justice Frank Jensen (Social Democrats) on November 4, 2000: \\"Will the Minister explain for the case of Peter Lundin, including why the man was not supervised by the police after arriving in Denmark, and for what initiatives the minister will take to avoid a similar situation in the future?\\"Spm. No. 39, To the Minister of Justice (4/10 2000) by Eva Kjer Hansen (V), Folketing The Justice Minister replied 14 days later. After he had first consulted with both the Police Chief in Gladsaxe and with the Copenhagen police director: \\"...Upon arrival, the person was received by the Copenhagen Police, but released immediately after arrival, as he was not wanted in the Central Criminal Register. Interpol- Copenhagen, prior to arriving at Copenhagen Airport, the US authorities informed the police without receiving any further information about the Danish citizen in question. Interpol-Copenhagen informed the Copenhagen Police of the arrival, and when his father's residence was then resident in Gentofte Police District, Interpol-Copenhagen also informed the Police Chief in Gentofte. The chief of police in Gladsaxe has told the Ministry of Justice that the Danish citizen in question, after arriving, stayed with a girlfriend in Ballerup, (at that time it was passed by the police and the Ministry of Justice that Peter and Tina Lundin were already married at that time) why the person was sent from Gentofte police to the Police Chief in Gladsaxe. During the Criminal Investigation in Gladsaxe, the submitted documents were reviewed, and at a subsequent staff meeting, the staff were informed, in accordance with usual practice, of matters relating to the person concerned, and the staff were informed that they should be aware of the person's behavior when they took him or others received information about him, for example in connection with filed reviews.\\"Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 52 \\"On the specific case, it can be stated, moreover, that the Ministry of Justice already in 1996 addressed the US authorities with a view to transferring the Danish citizen in question for enforcement in Denmark, which, however, the US authorities refused.\\" The then Minister of Justice Frank Jensen then explained, among other things, the possibilities of the Criminal Code for supervision of previously punished persons, and he added: \\"...In principle, in my view, speaking against a more systematic and intensive monitoring speaks of previously convicted persons when there is no suspicion of further offenses.\\"Palle Bruus Jensen, \\"The case Lundin\\" (2003), page 53 Personal life =Detention and Assault= While he was in custody on July 27, 2000 in Vridsl√∏selille Prison, he was attacked by several inmates. He was struck with an iron tube, which broke his nose. In February 2002, he was attacked again when he was beaten by fellow inmates with a frying pan on his head. He filed a case and demanded $10,000 in compensation for the harm done. On April 16, 2002, he was awarded DKK 510 in compensation by the √òstre Landsret. In 2007, he was transferred to the top-secured State Prison of East Jutland. However, he has subsequently been moved back to the Institution of Herstedvester again. =Incarcerated marriages= After the airing of The American Dream on TV 2 in 1994, many Danish women contacted Peter Lundin and in 1996 he married one of them, a woman named Tina. On September 28, 2008, he was married to Mariann Poulsen in Statsf√¶ngslet √òstjylland, but after 11 days filed for divorce when she claimed that he had lied to her about another woman whom he was lovers with while they were married. She told this on October 9, 2008, when she appeared on GO 'Aften Danmark. On May 26, 2011 Lundin married a woman named Bettina. They were together from 2009 until 3 October 2017. =Drugs= On August 21, 2006, he was sentenced to 40 days in prison by the Court of Glostrup for holding 92.7 grams of cannabis in his prison cell. He was again sentenced to 10 days in prison by the Court of Glostrup on April 23, 2012, for having 8.5 grams of cannabis and four amphetamine pills on July 26, 2011. Lundin was accused in September 2012 to be behind the smuggling of cannabis and other substances in the Institute of Herstedvester. =Name change= In November 2011, Lundin changed his name to Niels Schaftner, but this was later changed to Bjarne Skounborg. Appeals =Lawsuit against journalist= A journalist on the Danish newspaper Information, Kristian Ditlev Jensen, called Peter Lundin a psychopath by writing the sentence \\"We are, basically, not clinical psychopaths in the Peter Lundin category\\" () in an editorial not otherwise about Peter Lundin. This prompted Lundin to file a lawsuit. The lawsuit was settled in court, clearing the journalist by explaining that the \\"sentence should be taken as a statement that the plaintiff is a clear-cut example of a psychopath in the sense of a deviating person\\" (). =Lawsuit against Pia Kj√¶rsgaard= On November 18, 2008, the then Danish People's Party chairman Pia Kj√¶rsgaard commented on Peter Lundin on the breakfast show Go' morgen Danmark, where she said: \\"He is simply as callous as you possibly can be\\" (). In February 2009 this got Lundin to sue Kj√¶rsgaard for DKK 100,000 for defamation. Lundin's lawyer Peter Hj√∏rne stated to the press that she has called him as callous as anyone can be, and that it was against all citizens of the country who are protected. At the Court in Lyngby on March 4, 2010, the court dismissed Lundin's claim for DKK 100,000 in compensation and Kj√¶rsgaard was acquitted. The judge emphasized that the Dansk Sprogn√¶vn had stated during the case that synonyms for the word \\"afstumpet\\" (~\\"callous\\") are insensitive, brutal, emotional, rough and raw. In addition, the court also emphasized that the statements by Kj√¶rsgaard were made in a public television debate in a breakfast show and as part of a more general criticism of the media's coverage of persons convicted of serious crime. In addition, the court also emphasized the nature of the extremely serious crimes that Lundin was convicted of. =Case against DR hosts= On February 28, 2014, he sued the Cavling Prize- nominated DR host Line Gertsen and the host Kim Bilds√∏e Lassen for libel. In concrete terms, Lundin believed that the DR duo went far beyond the line, when they in a feature in the TV newspaper in September 2012 accused him of being behind the hash deal in Herstedvester prison, where he was imprisoned. Lundin's lawyer Tage Siboni stated that; \\"Some wrong allegations have been made in the TV newspaper against two people - Bjarne Skounborg (Peter Lundin) and an unnamed woman. It has been called for rectification by the DR, but they refuse. Therefore, we have created a case.\\" Prior to the feature mentioned, the TV newspaper was in possession of a report which allegedly revealed that Lundin was the man behind the cannabis sale in prison. The law of defamation took place at the Copenhagen City Court. Here, Lundin demanded compensation of DKK 25,000 and correction of the news piece. On March 28, 2014, Line Gertsen and Kim Bilds√∏e Lassen were acquitted of libel against Lundin. At the same time, the court decided that Peter Lundin and his wife had to pay all the costs within fourteen days, corresponding to DKK 20,000. The verdict was as follows: Media The publishing house of Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet sparked a lot of debate when it announced plans in 2001 to cooperate with Lundin to write a book about him. The plans, however, were dropped shortly after the announcement - on the grounds that the book would not contain enough \\"news and quality content\\". In 2002, TvDanmark2 asked for the program Sensing Murder, where clairvoyants tried to find the bodies of Marianne Pedersen and her two sons. Many places on Zealand, among other things, landfills and cemeteries near Faxe and K√∏ge were investigated, but the clairvoyants failed to find the bodies. In 2003, the book Sagen Lundin. Forbrydelsen, opklaringen, medierne og ondskaben (The Lundin Case. The crime, the investigation, the media, and the evil) by Palle Bruus Jensen was released, including analyses by a psychiatrist, Henrik Day Poulsen. In 2009, Lundin and the co-author Rikke Pedersen published the book titled A murderer's confessions on the publishing house Turbulenz. The book is an autobiography in which he talks about his childhood, his close relationship with his mother and the life behind the bars. It was initially not a great success, but after a month had sold 5,000 copies.Don't read book about Lundin TV 2 News; October 29, 2009 References Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Danish people of German descent Category:Danish expatriates in the United States Category:Danish people convicted of murder Category:Danish people imprisoned abroad Category:Danish prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment Category:Danish serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by Denmark Category:People convicted of murder by North Carolina Category:People deported from the United States Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Denmark ","title":"Peter Lundin"},{"id":"10791882","text":"Ilamai Oonjal Aadukirathu () is a 1978 Indian Tamil-language romance film written and directed by C.

Prabhu meets them without realising that Murali knows about him and Jayanthi and apologises to Murali for leaving their home suddenly. Murali though is in no mood to forgive him. But Padma, on learning that Prabhu married Jayanthi before she died, forgives him and tries to become close to him again. Seeing them together, an enraged Murali takes Prabhu to a cliff; when he is about to shoot Prabhu, Padma reveals that they were originally in love and how they broke up due to Jayanthi's interference and Prabhu's honourable act in making Jayanthi his wife and legitimising their child, before she died.

Produced by Venu Chettiar and V. Mohan, the film stars Rajinikanth, Sarath Babu, Jayalaxmi and Shoba. It marks Mahendran's directorial debut and is partly based on Uma Chandran's novel of the same name, which was serialised in the Tamil magazine Kalki in 1966. Mullum Malarum tells the story of Kali (Rajinikanth), a winch operator of a cable trolley who dotes on his sister Valli (Shoba) since they were orphaned, and clashes with his boss Kumaran (Sarath Babu). Mahendran read only part of the novel, and developed the screenplay as he wanted, making a visually-focused film without formulaic Tamil cinema conventions he disliked such as melodrama, overacting, excessive dialogue and duets. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, cinematographer Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assisted him with the screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. Principal photography lasted for about 30 days, taking place primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, though some scenes were also filmed in Ooty, Tamil Nadu. The film was edited by D. Vasu, and the soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja. Mullum Malarum was released on 15 August 1978. Although it opened to tepid box-office earnings, positive reviews from critics and favourable word of mouth in later weeks helped make it a success with a theatrical run of over 100 days. The film received praise primarily for Rajinikanth's performance, Balu Mahendra's cinematography, Ilaiyaraaja's music, Mahendran's writing and establishing Tamil cinema as a \\"visual medium\\". It won the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Tamil, the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film and Rajinikanth won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award Special Prize for his performance. Mullum Malarum became a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. He continued following this style in all his later films. The film's success inspired a Malayalam remake titled Venalil Oru Mazha in 1979, and a Hindi version titled Pyari Behna in 1985.  Plot  Orphaned at a young age, Kali and his sister Valli grew up on the streets and were street performers. Kali played the drums and Valli perched herself atop a pole balanced by an older boy. Kali frequently gets angry at people who he thinks lack empathy for the socially or financially deprived. As adults, the siblings live in a hilltop village where Kali works for a powerhouse in the valley below. From a shed in the village, he operates a winch for a cable trolley which ferries employees to work. The powerhouse's new divisional engineer, the rule-abiding but fair Kumaran, notices Kali offering free rides to unauthorised townspeople. When he orders the passengers out, citing rules of operation, Kali becomes angry and stops the trolley half-way downhill. Kumaran shrugs off this act with a knowing smile. On a nearby canal's bank, Valli meets a young woman, Manga, who, along with her mother, has arrived from a drought-stricken town, Ilaiyangudi. The mother is looking for work, and both women are hungry‚ÄîManga ravenously so, a fondness for food becoming one of her primary characteristics. Valli feeds and shelters them for the night, and asks Kali about allowing them to use the vacant house next door. Meanwhile, Kali roughs up his fellow employees whom he suspects of snitching on him to Kumaran. Kali is given a final warning by Kumaran as a prelude to serious disciplinary action. While Kali is at work, Manga appears, picks up his watch and teasingly declares she will run away with it. A chase ensues, taking them through the woods and into the river. Waist-deep in the water, Kali retrieves the watch and rushes back to the shed. During his absence, a child living in the valley has needed medical attention. After the emergency alarm at the shed has rung for several minutes, a passerby steps in to operate the winch. The child is transported back in the trolley and dispatched to a hospital. The following day, Kumaran suspends Kali from his job for ten days for gross misconduct. That evening, Kali goes to the nearby Mullimalai to assuage his anger at Kumaran among the Badagas, joining them in singing and dancing. While staggering back home drunk, Kali passes out on an unlit street. A truck drives over his left arm, which is amputated at a city hospital. As a result, Kumaran fires Kali since he can no longer perform his job adequately with one arm. At Valli's prompting, Kali and Manga agree to marry; they have a simple wedding ceremony held at the local temple. Kumaran attends and brings a present of cash, which Kali spurns, but Manga accepts. Kumaran becomes attracted to Valli. After determining her willingness for marriage, he requests permission from Kali who asks him to return the following day. Later that day, Kali corners Murgesa, a local grocer who is known for flirtatious behaviour, and offers him his sister's hand in marriage. An engagement ceremony for Murgesa and Valli is arranged. At the ceremony, Manga angrily interferes in the main ritual, which makes Kali furious at his wife. He physically assaults her repeatedly, but Manga remains firm in her opposition. The next day, Manga convinces Kumaran and Valli to marry without Kali's knowledge, but he accosts their wedding party on its way to the temple. Kali accuses his sister of abandoning him because of his handicap. Valli is filled with guilt and rushes into his arm. Kali reminds the onlookers that he remains the most important man in his sister's life. Although he still dislikes Kumaran, Kali's self- esteem is restored, and he offers his blessings for the marriage.  Cast  * Rajinikanth as Kali * Sarath Babu as Kumaran * Jayalaxmi as Manga * Shoba as Valli * Venniradai Moorthy as Murugesa *Samikannu as Payapulla  Production  = Development = Despite the success of his projects in the 1970s including Thanga Pathakkam (1974) and Aadu Puli Attam (1977), screenwriter Mahendran had become disillusioned with the mainstream Tamil cinema, which he criticised for its obsession with commercial success, routine melodrama, excessive dialogues, duets and a typical climax. He decided to take a sabbatical from screenwriting, but was under constant pressure from film producers to write for them. It was then that Mahendran began soliciting novels to adapt, one of which was Uma Chandran's Mullum Malarum (1966). First serialised in the Tamil magazine, Kalki, it won the first prize in Kalkis novel competition for the magazine's silver jubilee in 1966. While reading the novel, Mahendran was attracted by the protagonist Kali's job as a winch operator and his highly self-respecting character. He read until the chapter where Kali loses his arm to a tiger, and developed the screenplay completely according to his own wish. Unlike the novel, in Mahendran's screenplay Kali loses his arm when it is run over by a truck. Additionally, the novel ends with the deaths of Kali and his wife Manga, which Mahendran did not include in his screenplay. Upon completion, Mahendran did not immediately pitch his story to any investors, but instead \\"quietly filed it away\\", as he believed that no producer would want to produce a film that lacked all the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions. It was only after producer Venu Chettiar of Ananthi Films approached Mahendran with an offer that he pitched Mullum Malarum, describing it as a brother and sister story. Chettiar accepted the story without listening to it fully and wanted Mahendran to both write and direct the film. Under the assumption that Chettiar had only accepted due to his belief that Mahendran would make a successful brother-sister film like the melodramatic Pasamalar (1961), Mahendran refrained from disclosing to him that what he envisioned was radically different, with more focus on visuals than dramatics. The film marked Mahendran's directorial debut, with Chettiar and V. Mohan producing it. Ramasamy was signed as art director, and D. Vasu as editor. Ramachandra Babu declined when approached by Mahendran to be the cinematographer, and Ashok Kumar, whom Ramachandra Babu suggested, could not accept to work on the film. Mahendran was unable to find a worthy cinematographer until actor Kamal Haasan introduced him to Balu Mahendra, who agreed to work on the film, making his debut in Tamil cinema. Haasan worked as a production manager on the film. = Casting = After the release of Aadu Puli Attam, Mahendran wanted Rajinikanth, who portrayed the film's antagonist, to act as the male lead in his directorial debut film. Though Chettiar remonstrated against the actor's suitability for the role due to his dark skin and typecasting as a villain, he reluctantly capitulated after Mahendran intransigently declared that he could not possibly direct the film without him, believing him to be tailor-made for the part. After directing the Kannada film Kokila (1977), Balu Mahendra wanted its lead actress Shoba to act in his first Tamil film. She was eventually cast as Kali's sister Valli, alongside Sarath Babu as the divisional engineer Kumaran and Jayalaxmi as Manga. Mahendran cast Venniradai Moorthy as Murugesa, the philandering grocer, and Samikannu was given a role as Payapulla, one of Kali's henchmen. Male supporting roles were played by S. A. Kannan, Pazhaniyappan, Dasaradan, Rangamani, Sarathi, Santhanam, Kumarimuthu, Jothi Shanmugham, Chellappa, Amalraj, Poondigiri and Vairam Krishnamoorthy. Female supporting roles were played by Santhamma, Jayakumari, Vijaya, Jaya, Pushpa, Radha, Prema, Vasanthi, Leela and Kala. = Filming = Mullum Malarum was filmed on 35 mm ORWO colour film. It was shot primarily in Sringeri, Karnataka, with additional filming in Ooty, Tamil Nadu; principal photography lasted about 30 days. Chettiar initially refused to let Mahendran shoot in Sringeri, citing financial constraints, but Mahendran's friend Pazhaniappan convinced Chettiar and agreed to pay for the Sringeri shooting schedule. Once while passing through Pondicherry, Mahendran witnessed a game of Uriyadi, which inspired him to include two Uriyadi scenes in the film which were not originally part of the script. Mahendran also decided to characterise Manga as a \\"meen paithiyam\\" (meaning a \\"foodie who loves fish\\") after being inspired by Sringeri's marine environment. Balu Mahendra stated that he avoided incorporating the usual hero-heroine dancing into the film because he thought it was like \\"watching two drunken monkeys dancing\\". Instead, he allocated music to the background when the lead characters expressed their emotions. Since Mahendran had no previous directing experience, Balu Mahendra, who was already an established director, assumed responsibility and responded to Mahendran's suggestions for screenplay, dialogue, camera angles, casting and editing. He shot the film predominantly using natural light. According to Mahendran, Chettiar never arrived at the shooting spot; he expected a melodramatic, dialogue-heavy film, and would have shelved the project had he known about Mahendran's filmmaking style. Sarath Babu was originally supposed to lip sync the full \\"Senthazham Poovil\\" scene, picturised on Kumaran and Valli, but Mahendra and Mahendran agreed on a montage after the actor performed a line or two. During the filming of the climax where Kali lets Kumaran marry Valli despite their enmity, Sarath Babu disputed the part where Kali professes to still dislike Kumaran, leading him to storm off the set. When he was brought back by the producer, he tempestuously confronted Mahendran, who informed him that Kali dislikes Kumaran till the end. He offered the possibility of filming it with Kali saying those words without Kumaran present, but Sarath Babu ultimately appeared. After watching the film's double positive, Chettiar was perplexed by the lack of melodrama and lengthy dialogues, since he hired Mahendran as director due to his success as a dialogue writer and did not expect such a visually-focused film. Mahendran had yet to film a scene set before \\"Senthazham Poovil\\" but Chettiar, discontent with the budget escalating, refused to finance it until he was won over by Haasan who financed the scene, and filming was completed. Mullum Malarum final reel length was .  Themes  Film critic Naman Ramachandran likened Kali's relationship with Valli to how flowers need thorns for protection. According to critic Baradwaj Rangan, the title Mullum Malarum can be interpreted in two ways: \\"the thorn and the flower\\", which describes Kali and Valli; and \\"even a thorn will bloom\\", which foreshadows how Kali softens at the end. Mahendran considered the latter to be the real meaning of the film's title. S. Rajanayagam, author of the 2015 book Popular Cinema and Politics in South India: The Films of MGR and Rajinikanth, described Kali as the thorn and flower in the film; he characterised Kali as an \\"angry young man with a kind heart\\" who does not admit mistakes, despite having committed acts such as breaking car headlights and allowing people to ride the trolley, in violation of the powerhouse's rules. He noted that films like Mullum Malarum stereotype the poor as \\"all that is pristine and traditional\\", and leave the \\"overall socio-economic system\\" which made them poor unchallenged, but within this system, \\"the hero will be 'richer' in terms of his moral uprightness\\". Journalist Kavitha Muralidharan wrote that most of Mahendran's films show characters with contrasting personalities, citing the docile Valli and the garrulous Manga in Mullum Malarum as examples. Regarding this, Mahendran said, \\"I only show them as they are in real life\\". According to film historian Yves Thoraval, Mullum Malarum explores \\"the extreme Oedipal possessiveness of a married brother for his younger sister\\". Thoraval said this was a recurring theme in Indian films starting with Bahen in 1941. Ramachandran noted that Kali, like Rajinikanth's character in Bairavi (1978), is responsible for his sister's welfare. Unlike Bairavi, the siblings in Mullum Malarum are not separated; this leads Kali's protectiveness of Valli to the brink of obsession. Ramachandran regarded egotism as one of Mullum Malarum central themes, identifying Kali as the alpha male of his community. According to an article published in Cinema Vision India, the film stresses \\"that people changeand they must\\". Ramachandran noted that when Kali's arm is amputated, he feels helpless and emasculated, and Kumaran becomes an easy target. Kali refuses to see the benefits of his sister marrying a wealthy and educated man, even when Manga asks for his consent, but sees the error of his ways when Valli abandons her wedding party to join her brother: \\"My sister has shown all of you that I am the most important person in her life. I need only that happiness for the rest of my life. And it is with that pride and arrogance that I give my permission for my sister to marry\\". Writing for Frontline, Venkatesh Chakravarthy noted that the film ends with Kali relenting to Valli's desire to marry the man she wishes but not before he tells Kumaran that he still dislikes him, \\"which makes the film open-ended with a feel that life goes on\\".  Music  Mullum Malarums soundtrack was composed by Ilaiyaraaja, with lyrics by Panchu Arunachalam, Gangai Amaran and Kannadasan. Unlike most Tamil films of that time, the film does not include any duets. The song \\"Adi Penney\\" is set in the Carnatic raga known as Madhyamavati. \\"Raman Aandaalum\\" is set in Mayamalavagowla, and \\"Senthazham Poovil\\" is set in Bowli. \\"Maan Iname\\", sung by Ilaiyaraaja, does not feature on the soundtrack. Elements of \\"Raman Aandaalum\\" were later used in \\"Machi Open the Bottle\\", composed by Yuvan Shankar Raja for Mankatha (2011).  Release  Mullum Malarum was released on 15 August 1978. As the film's commercial performance during its first few weeks was poor, both Mahendran and Rajinikanth summoned Chettiar to further publicise the film to improve its revenues. He declined, caustically replying that an unsuccessful film cannot be pushed in the market however much publicised, and a successful film needs no publicity. During its third or fourth week of release, positive magazine reviews and favourable word of mouth spread; Mullum Malarum became a commercial success, with a theatrical run of over 100 days. Chettiar later apologised to Mahendran, who in turn thanked him for letting him make the film. After watching the film and being impressed with Rajinikanth's performance, his mentor, director K. Balachander wrote in a letter of appreciation that he was proud to have introduced him as an actor in Tamil cinema. Balachander's letter has been described by Sify as Rajinikanth's \\"most prized moment and possession\\". After its success, Mullum Malarum was remade in Malayalam by Sreekumaran Thampi as Venalil Oru Mazha (1979) and in Hindi by Bapu as Pyari Behna (1985). It was also dubbed in Telugu as Mullu Puvvu, and released in 1979. = Critical reception = Mullum Malarum was well received at the time of its initial release, with commentators applauding it for establishing Tamil cinema as a \\"visual medium\\". The writer of a 25 August 1978 review in The Hindu appreciated the film for not having the \\"usual formula of fights, duets, intrigues and cabaret dances\\". The reviewer further noted that Rajinikanth showed \\"his mature artistry in a portrayal of a turbulent illiterate worker with a blind passion for his sister\\". They also praised the performances of Shoba and Jayalaxmi, called Balu Mahendra's camera work a \\"feast for the eyes\\", and Ilaiyaraaja's melodies \\"delicious\\"; although the reviewer criticised the first half of the film for moving at a \\"leisurely pace\\", they said the second half was \\"eventful\\". The Tamil magazine Ananda Vikatan, in its 3 September 1978 review, applauded the performances of Rajinikanth and Sarath Babu, along with Balu Mahendra's cinematography and Ilaiyaraaja's music. The reviewer also praised Mahendran's filmmaking skills and the fact that he told the story in a sharp manner without long dialogues, likening the film to Kurinchi flowers due to their rarity and rating it 61 out of 100. After watching the film, M. G. Ramachandran‚Äîthe then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu‚Äîtold Mahendran that he had no words to express his happiness, and that Mahendran set a new trend in Tamil cinema with Mullum Malarum. Ramachandran stated that Mahendran had reached a milestone beyond expectations. He added that Mahendran demonstrated clearly that cinema is a \\"visual medium\\". Ramachandran commented that the depiction of brother-sister relationships in film up to this point were full of dramatics, even in his own, but Mullum Malarum stood apart in its realism. He said the final scene was new not only to Tamil cinema but also to Indian cinema. Ramachandran lauded Rajinikanth's realistic acting and hoped the Ô¨Ålm would mark a big turnaround in his career. = Accolades = Mullum Malarum won the Filmfare Award for Best Film ‚Äì Tamil, and two awards at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards: Best Film, and Special Prize for Rajinikanth, who also won the Arima Sangam Award for Best Actor. The film was screened at the 1979 International Film Festival of India as part of its Indian Panorama section.  Legacy  Mullum Malarum attained cult status in Tamil cinema. It was a breakthrough for Rajinikanth as an actor and a milestone of Tamil cinema for focusing prominently on visuals and realism without the formulaic Tamil cinema conventions that Mahendran disliked. Mahendran continued following this style in all his later films. According to K. Balamurugan of Rediff.com, the film established that Rajinikanth \\"can be a director's actor too\\" and widened his fan base \\"from youngsters to the families and the women\\". In December 2013, The Times of India said that with this film, Rajinikanth \\"dispelled whatever doubts remained about his acting ability\\". Rajinikanth himself considers Mullum Malarum one of his five most favourite films and Mahendran his favourite director. \\"Kali\\" (alternatively, Kaali) became Rajinikanth's most- frequent onscreen name; his characters in Kaali (1980), Kai Kodukkum Kai (1984) and Petta (2019) also shared that name. In October 2015, director Pa. Ranjith said that Rajinikanth's characterisation in Mullum Malarum was a \\"lesson\\" of sorts for him, and the actor's character in Ranjith's Kabali (2016) was influenced by Kali in Mullum Malarum. The film's score has been regarded as one of the best of Ilaiyaraaja's career by commentators; the songs \\"Senthazham Poovil\\" and \\"Raman Aandalum\\" in particular, remain hugely popular. The latter was used in the climax sequence of Petta.
